        "caption": "Finally got the chance to try Moni\u2019s yesterday! We ordered 2 dinner plates (be prepared for generous servings). The jerk catfish nuggets were on point and had so much flavor! Green beans and greens were good. The cheeseburger was okay, we liked the seasoning on the meat but didn\u2019t really think it belonged on a hamburger. The best part about the meal was the Mac and cheese. Hands down one of the best Mac and cheese we\u2019ve ever had from a restaurant. We can\u2019t wait to buy from this establishment again.",

I was deterred by the level of customer service received when first entering the restaurant. We were greeted with a hello and that was that. No instruction on how to order food or how the establishment operated.",

So far I've been in three times and have tried multiple items off the menu including Fried Pork Chops, Hamburger w/ Fries, Mac & Cheese, Cornbread Stuffing and Stewed Pears. Everything I've had is as if my own mother made it with love.  Thank you for such a wonderful place to find that comfort food we're all looking for.",
