I have expressed this before only to be told by an owner or manager that I was wrong about my personal opinion and to go back and try it again.... For a fourth time. I will not spend my money here and I will never tell anyone to go here. I will give it 2 stars because the waitresses I've delt with are nice people and I can't fault them. Just got another response from the owner who cannot take criticism of their product. Im not \"overly obsessed with hating this place\", rather I'm just trying to give my personal opinion. But apparently you can't have that if you disagree with them. I'm happy other people like their food, but the sub 4 star rating should have the owner looking for ways to make their product better not just throwing any criticism to the side and being delusional in how many people see their restaurant.",

I would say less good as a spot to just order takeout (unfortunate given the current COVID state of the world).  Food was fine. My burrito was kinda lame. Rice and beans were cold and uninspired. The chicken (Pollo Pibil) was pretty good, but nothing crazy and didn't make up for the plain flavor of the rice, beans, and salsa fresca. The taco I ordered (Al Pastor) was good. I wish there was more pineapple. The pork overpowered the pineapple, but that might be just me lol.  Also, I grabbed an order of the Three Cheese Tequila Queso. Got back to my place, did not have any chips. I assumed it would come with chips because it is under the \"Chips\" section of the online menu and was $8.00. The menu is not clear as to whether chips are free and I am supposed to ask for them, or if chips are only included with items that explicitly say they come with chips (Solo Salsa & Chips, Chips & Guac, Nachos, etc.). Either way, it is silly that I would have to explicitly ask for chips with the dip I ordered, or obnoxious to have to pay for chips separately on top an $8.00 dip.",

One food runner, a bartender back up bringing orders without a face mask. At least half of the cooks or those putting orders together did not have masks on. No communication, no compensation offered such as a free drink or whatever, just wait for your food that you already paid for in these conditions or leave. If it was more than you could have handled you should have limited the amount of orders that could be placed. At the very least, follow the guidelines, wear masks, wear gloves, have hand sanitizer available for the food runner that is handling every customers order.

Again, another opportunity to communicate with us, or apologize.  We tried to give them every chance to earn our business. Our party of 6 then decided to leave.  I spoke to the owner before leaving.  Told her we were reasonable and that it was obvious they didn't have a full staff at the moment, but that no one ever bothered to communicate that to us.  It would have taken 10 seconds to come over to our table.  Instead, they let the 6 of us leave, and for me and my family, who go here at least 1 time a month, if not more, it's going to be a long while before we give them a second chance, if. we do at all.

We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our to go order (bartender was excellent!). I ordered the seven pound burrito and asked for all sauce on the side with an side of sour cream. I got home, no sour cream, no queso. The burrito was unbearably salty, the rice was hard, the steak was fatty, and undercooked. Not wanting to waste our money or travel back down at ten at night, we continued eating. Lo and behold I found a hair. Glad I saw it before I ingested it. Of course I didnt want another burrito or anything else from them, just to deal with another salty dish or hair. I called the location to let them know the cook is over salting the food and etc. The first thing I mentioned was the hair, their reply was all our cooks are bald and have no facial hair. I bid them farewell and disconnected, Deep South Taco is no longer our go to option for Friday night family dinner.",

        "caption": "Yikes!  We were so excited to come here this evening and it turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences I\u2019ve had in a while!  We were promptly seated and the server was friendly and quickly took our order.  We had chips and guacomole served soonafter, but then we waited and waited and waited.  Well over an hour we waited for our entre\u2019s and still nothing.  Pretty much every other table seated around us (with folks that arrived after we were seated) had been served and yet, we still waited.  We asked to speak with a manager soon after, and he was apologetic and explained that another large party had been seated and slowed things down in the kitchen (which seemed odd, given that the restaurant was only half full with many open tables).  The manager acknowledged that this wasn\u2019t a good excuse and assured us that our food would be out shortly and continued to offer his apologies.  We still waited another solid twenty minutes before our entre\u2019s finally arrived and while we held onto hope that the food would be well worth the wait, it was certainly not.  Most of the tacos and burritos were cold, the fajita\u2019s were not sizzling and everything was over salted to the point that the dishes were barely edible.  Thankfully, the manager didn\u2019t charge us for anything we were served when we expressed our displeasure with the condition and quality of our food.  While I can appreciate that the manager seemed to own up to the fact that what we experienced was unacceptable, it really made for a horrible end to our evening.  The ambience and atmosphere of this place is really great, but they seemed so disorganized and lost tonight.  I\u2019ve since seen that many others have shared similar experiences, so unless this crew can right the ship quickly they seem to be headed down a path that doesn\u2019t lead to good things for anyone.  An update in response to the owner:  what an odd, inappropriate and totally confusing response!  I wasn\u2019t trashing your restaurant at all - just simply stating the truth of our experience.  The fact that we weren\u2019t charged for the food that we didn\u2019t eat (I can send you the photos we took of our un eaten food if you\u2019d like) doesn\u2019t excuse what we experienced.  In fact, when you have to write \u201cI\u2019m not making excuses\u201d - you are basically making excuses.   If I had posted a five star review - that would be me being dishonest.  My response was just an honest telling of what we experienced - if you don\u2019t like it, then do a better job to change what your customers experience.  Also - it doesn\u2019t sound like you were there at the restaurant, so clearly you weren\u2019t there to see all of the empty tables both upstairs and on the outside patio.  I\u2019ve been at many full restaurants (with people waiting to be seated) and have never had to wait for as long as we waited for an entree to be delivered. For me - this means that you are either understaffed or there is a serious disorganization problem in your kitchen.  Also, I\u2019m not Native American - but I have no idea why that would be relevant in any way, shape or form (it\u2019s just so random and unrelated - it would be like me writing \u201cI also have red shoes and breath air!\u201d).  I am 100% confident that your response to my initial review is abnormal - a customer service based owner would have simply replied that they regretted the bad experience the customer had and would have pledged to work harder to ensure that they wouldn\u2019t have the same experience again if they were ever gracious enough to return for a second try (instead of attacking them and essentially calling them liars). I truly wish you all the best of luck, but ensure you that you will need to change the way you serve and interact with your customers if you want your business to survive in the competitive and customer driven restaurant industry.",

One waiter walked by our table at least 4 times without acknowledging us. After 20 minutes, my dad went and asked a waitress if she could help us and she reluctantly took our order. Our chips and salsa arrived about 19 minutes before our drinks with no silverware or napkins. The margaritas were good, but warm. The waitress then had to ask my mother which kind of quesadilla she'd ordered after we'd been waiting for our entrees for about 20 minutes. The food arrived hot but was just mediocre. Dad's tacos were bland, I could have gotten better fajitas at Chili's, but mom enjoyed her quesadilla. All in all, the food was mediocre, the drinks were good, and the service was terrible. We will not be going back",

There was not enough room for my fianc\u00e9, myself, and a friend to sit with the group and all the other tables were either occupied or reserved. We were told that we could sit outside. The waitress took our orders and then the three of us went out to the patio to find a table. My friend ordered just an alcoholic drink. My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered a pitcher of frozen margaritas and two orders of chicken and steak combo fajitas. The margaritas were okay and WAY overpriced at $38! We then got our fajitas and they were not good. Our friend tried some and she didn\u2019t think they were good either. They just had this funky kind of taste to them, it\u2019s difficult to explain. I would have brought this to the attention of our waitress but she never returned! She never asked how anything was or refilled our waters. Then we get the bill and see we were charged 18% gratuity. We all didn\u2019t agree with that charge because we didn\u2019t sit with the group inside and our waitress could care less about us. I just wanted to leave and didn\u2019t feel like getting into a confrontation with anyone so we paid and left. Very disappointing experience. We will never be back. There\u2019s much better places in Buffalo for tacos, fajitas, and margs that don\u2019t overcharge you.",

We waited, we ate and the food was ok at best.  As we were finishing up, a maggot came crawling from the plate.  It fell on the ground and the manager couldn\u2019t find it, so I don\u2019t think he fully believed. He took only a minimal amount off and we left.

It didn't have much flavor at all so I put the salsa we ordered as an appetizer on it. Got the shrimp taco and the crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was mushy inside and also flavorless, I hope it was cooked all the way......I guess I'll see tomorrow if I got food poisoning. The atmosphere was great. I'll go there for some adult beverages and maybe the chips and salsa only if I would ever go back.",

We went to the new location on transit road today since I had heard good things and it was right around the corner from my house.  The food was okay but pricey.  I had gotten a whiskey cocktail and it was made really strong so I couldn't taste anything other than the whiskey.  The only real issue we had was that we are on the bigger side and the chairs were horrible.  We were sat at a high top tavle and the chairs had smaller seats and side bars coming to half way into the seat meaning I couldn't really sit on it at all. I had to lean on it and brace myself on the bar on the table.  Looking around the chairs for the normal tables did look much better even though they were bigger.  I looked at the booths too and i would have to decide between not fitting on a chair or having the booth table dig into my stomach.  I probably won't be back unless they get better seating and I warn other bigger people that they may be uncomfortable during their stay.",

They've gotten so many things right: the overall branding/design of the restaurant is amazing, the food is delicious, and the service is top notch. Deep South has become at least a once-a-week destination for us; we've never had a bad experience.  Some advice: Always, always, always order the nachos. I literally dream about them.  More advice: Check out brunch. Some of the best (and must unique) breakfast food in the city. The churro french toast is heaven. And...ummm...they have breakfast nachos. So. Dang. Good.  My only criticism is that they serve beer in plastic cups, which makes the beer warm up pretty fast. I grumble about it to myself every time we go...but the food/service/space more than makes up for the plastic cups :)",

Word to the wise, pass on the red mole sauce.If fajitas are more your style, definitely get them next time you go! They were delicious! If tacos are your true love, the grilled fish taco is supreme!

I had heard the food had gone downhill but I refused to believe it, and had to see for myself, sadly, I'd have to agree.  Chorizo taco had ONE piece of chopped chorizo in it, the tacos we ordered were all mixed up on each other's plates (good thing we didn't mind sorting it out for ourselves), the shrimp taco which was highly recommended to us, failed to excite anyone's taste buds, all in all they lacked flavor completely....on to the service....we had 4 or 5 different servers?, bus boys?, bartenders?, managers?, patrons?, come to our table delivering our food and drinks, it was so confusing and our actual waitress couldn't be bothered to check on us at all.  Drinks took forever, second round came out as we were finished eating and wanting to pay our bill, side of sour cream came once food was cold....my advice is to come for drinks and nachos at the bar since the atmosphere is so great (the bartenders were all really really great!!!) But skip the poor sit down service and unpalatable tacos.",

Either way, probably won't be back. Tacos are my thing, and I can honestly say I was quite disappointed.",

The tacos, although tasty and flavorful, are not very filling, expect to get three or four if you want a full meal. But they are also not cheap (between $4-$5). The tortilla is also a corn  tortilla not flour, which I thought was fine but my girlfriend was not a fan of. Overall, great atmosphere and margaritas with decent food that is overpriced and not very filling",
