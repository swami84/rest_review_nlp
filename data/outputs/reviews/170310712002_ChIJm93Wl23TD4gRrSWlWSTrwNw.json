More of a Gino's/ Giordano's type deep dish fan. I like Pequod's too, but wish their cheese to crust ratio was better. Ricobene's is good too, but I only ever want to get a King steak from them because it's the best sandwich in the world.  Bacino's is my new favorite deep dish. I hadn't had their pizza until my brother ordered it when visiting last year- and he tried it once- like 20 years ago at the Taste. His 5 year old son loved it too!! I wish I knew about them sooner & will def keep ordering from them.  I usually always get a deep dish pie- it's amazing. The thin crust I tried once and was also very good-similar to Giordano's thin crust. I would not recommend the extra thin for delivery. I also am not an ultra thin fan, unless I'm making it at home and eating it immediately.  It's really the sauce- I love the saltiness, acidity and the fact that it is not sweet. I've also never gotten a soggy crust on a deep dish pie from here- which is one of the biggest disappointments in getting a stuffed pizza.",

The cheese was so good. It was a perfect mix of stretchy and chewy and had an amazing rich taste. The prizes were really good. I highly recommend this place :)",

Immediately disgusted, I called a waitress over and I killed it with my cup. The customer service was horrible as well as our two apps and small stuffed pizza came at the same time. We were still forced to pay half of our check by the manager who had also happened to be our waitress. I will be calling later to complain in someone else\u2019s ear. Oh, also, when we first sat down, there were two dirty butter knives that were under our table that looked like they were there for a few days. Dirty place. Highly disappointing.",

I have lived all over the country and Asia for several years and I used to order the half baked frozen, but then you stopped. I have to make them myself and it takes a lot of work so I only get to have it once or twice a year now :-( I used to recommend your pizza to everyone when I was in college and worked hospitality in Chicago and now that I live out of state, I still recommend you to anyone traveling there.

Honestly, in Chicago, the food industry competition's stiff - a restaurant can have decent food but the waitstaff can make or break its reputation. I ate here not long ago. It wasn't crowded - two tables - but my waitress was so busy flirting with the four men at the other table that she seemed really annoyed at having to wait on me, too. I'm pretty low maintenance - I like to eat and write without being bothered - so her eye rolls and loud sighs at having to bring me silverware barely registered. But I had my food all of five minutes when she came over and asked \"you want me to get you a to go box or something?\" So. Weird. Anyway, the food was okay (I had the bolognese).  Would I eat here again if I happen to be walking by? Maybe. Would I go out of my way to come here? No.  Things to know: street parking, have to go downstairs to use the bathroom",

My children ordered spaghetti and meatballs. My son dies not usually like meat, but devoured the meatballs. The gravy was delicious. The event brought fresh bread which was good to soak up the sauce. My wife and I split a small, stuffed crust spinach and mushroom pizza. That was what I ordered all those years ago. The marinara was balanced. The crust was almost like a pie. It was cooked perfectly with a slight, crumbly crunch. The mozzarella was plentiful and mixed with spinach and mushrooms. Worth the wait. Probably the best pizza I have ever had.",

And there's always a nice selection of craft beers on tap, with flights available. The dining room and bathrooms are a bit too \"blast-from-the-past,\" but the booths are huge and comfy, and given the food, it's well worth overlooking the decor.",

There was 8 of us so we decided on 3 pizzas, a deep dish sausage & pepperoni; a deep dish sausage & green pepper; and a thin crust sausage & mushroom. Just the right amount of ingredients to make them yummy! They have specialty drinks & craft beers, don't look for frozen drinks, they don't make them. We are from the South side and we have been here twice. We will more than likely go back again! They except reservations and also have a party room for really large groups downstairs. If you are looking  for a really good pizza, try Bacino's, you won't be disappointed!",
