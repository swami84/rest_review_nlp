Hearty meals include Rotisserie Chicken and Cheeseburgers served on Italian bread instead of a traditional sesame bun. The staff are friendly and attentive but can easily misunderstand what you may ask for. I asked for the waitress what beers do they have she looked perplexed at 1st but then when I repeated my question, she muttered if two different beers. I was later joined by a friend on my visit and she asked the same question. She was given a drink list with all options of what they carried. This confused me. When seated while waiting on my lunch date, the staff was overly zealous approaching the table asking was I ready to order. Like 4+ times in a 15 minutes span. I understand being attentive but GEEZ. It made me feel the \"if you won't buy anything then we may ask you to leave.\" kinda vibe. The food is ok. Just tad pricey to be just ok. I haven't had anything here that's made me rant and rave but it's fine for a quick chew and chat with a buddy. My friend ordered the hot wings and said they were tasty. The guacamole needs some love. Flavorless. Just creamy green mush. They are often out of other menu entrees as well at times. Popular items are Rotisserie Chicken and the chili. Which during one visit, me and my fiance order and they had neither. I do like the chicken tenders here tho.",

Food took 30 minutes to arrive. FYI it was just 2 of us so not a ton of food to cook. 3. Each skillet we ordered was around 15$ + tax. Which is way pricey for that standard of food being served. 4. We were given flimsy plastic forks for our food. I understand it\u2019s COVID time and disposable spoons are the new norm but please provide decent cutlery which won\u2019t bend every time I poke a cooked potato. P.S. if they can serve plate and  glass of water which my server has touched, I wouldn\u2019t really mind clean, washed and wrapped normal forks. 5. Couldn\u2019t finish our food with those bendy forks, we waited for 10 minutes to get hold of a different server to ask for take out boxes, yet no sight of our server. We decided to go directly to the bar and pay there without receiving our cheque on the table. Phewwww. Glad I was able to get out of the mismanaged mess.",

The bus boy actually seated me and gave me a menu. When she finally appeared he\u00a0told her I was at the table, but I heard her say something inappropriate in spanish and she ignored me for 15 minutes before coming over.  I don't know the name, but she was a latina woman working Friday night (march 6th) around 8pm. To the manager: please train your waiters to be kind to customers and try to resolve the problem instead of forcing them to keep something they're not happy with. I will not eat here again.",

Shake.  We gave it back however there was no apologies from our very inattentive waiter, he seemed irritated. Also he did not give us flat ware to eat with, my 14 year old nephew got up an  got somem from another table. The soup was good and hot my mash potatoes were cold and was given before he brought the reheated chicken to go with it who brings part of a dinner.  Overall, the experience was not what we had many moons ago, because this is the third time that we have experienced poor service and thought it wise to let you know how the service and food has truly changed and not for the better.\u2639\ufe0f. Hope this help the food and customer service. 2 stars because the soup was good and it was peaceful in the dinning area.  Jb",

My husband and I waited patiently for the restaurant to open at 8 am for breakfast. At 8:03 am, the doors were not opened although staff was inside and should have been able to see us standing in front of the window. Finally, a young man came to the door and unlocked it. I reached for the second of the two entry door anticipating that he would say good morning and hold it so that I could follow him in. Instead, he allowed the door to just close in my face without any attempt to hold it. I was stunned that someone in the restaurant industry especially would lack general courtesy.  This has really left a strong impression for me of how Mellow Yellow has changed. Needless to say, after waiting in the area for 30 minutes to eat there we left immediately and went to the restaurant just down the street. Very disappointed with our old favorite, Mellow Yellow. Truly hope they will read this and teach their staff the basics of courtesy and kindness.",

I ordered veggie omelette... The Veggies were undercooked and I sensed the omelette had a \"microwave\" texture to it.  I studied under a chef and learned how to make omelettes,  you can tell the difference between one that is truly cooked in a skillet vs one that's been nuked in the microwave.  Anyway...  like an hour later, I got sick on my stomach!!!!  Something is definitely OFF about the place now.  I feel like either it's the COOKS or the MANAGEMENT, but the food has lost that personalized touch,  lacks seasoning and feels \"thrown together.\"  The only reason I am giving TWO STARS is because the WAITSTAFF was cordial, kind and accommodating.  But, I am afraid, sadly... I won't be back. And, that's unfortunate, because Mellow Yellow was a Hyde Park staple and a place you could count on for excellent, high-quality food.",

The eggs were not scrambled. They were flat, folded over with two specks of cheese on top, my 2 tiny slices of bacon were just that. Tiny. And the waitress brought me wheat toast instead of the blueberry muffin I had ordered. She corrected that error after I mentioned that my muffin was missing.

I ordered hot wings and soup which is pretty hard to mess up. I had to ask for water (which never came the first time I asked) and napkins. The food was hot and presented nicely but there was ABSOLUTELY no flavor whatsoever! Felt like I was eating air. Just a word of advice to the owner or cooks...PLEASE season the chicken! The sauce you put on them once they are cooked doesnt not substitute for the flavor. Also there was hair in the chicken, which was taken care of by the waiter, which I appreciated because I was highly disappointed. And one last thing, I'm not sure what you guys need to do about the fruit fly problem but its really unpleasant to keep swatting bugs away from your food especially if you're hardly enjoying it!\ud83d\ude29",

She had never been but I assured her she would not be disappointed and the cold two block walk in the snow would be worth it.... HOWEVER it was not! We were the ONLY two people there and sat for TEN minutes or more and didn't even get water. One lady was cleaning and two others seemed to be having a meeting with their manager. We also saw a guy in a lavender shirt on an an apron that looked like the guy in the photos on the wall. He didn't acknowledge us either. Just came in a few times to watch CNN. My wife got up at one point to remind them we were waiting but it didn't matter. I was so upset I decided to leave. As we were leaving I thought that the three ladies would acknowledge us, apologize, convince us to stay.... HOWEVER, they didn't even look at us. This had to be the worst customer service I've gotten in my life. Not to mention this is my BIRTHDAY weekend and I choose to go there and my wife and I were treated like we were invisible to everyone and we were the only customers there. Not happy! If it were possible to give no stars, I would have.",

The menu says meal comes with soup or salad but I was charged an addt'l $1 for my seafood 'gumbo' soup. It was soggy rice and itty bitty shreds of crab meat and zero seasoning. The waitress was SUPER knowledgeable, very helpful, prompt and attentive. She made our visit pleasant. The corned beef sandwich had about 5 thin slices of meat and looked like a kids meal. The chicken & waffles were delicious. I kept seeing people order this huge overflowing chili bread bowl so I would try that IF I happen to go again.",
