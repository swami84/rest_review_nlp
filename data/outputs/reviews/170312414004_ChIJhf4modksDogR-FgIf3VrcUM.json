The communication with Jeff, the Yum Dum, purveyor, was outstanding throughout the entire process. We had planned on a May event and then COVID hit and Jeff didn't blink an eye when we canceled. He immediately refunded my deposit.  I then rescheduled the event and Jeff was so accomodating. Yesterday we had the party and the event was so perfect. Dum Yum kept the food flowing. Guests loved ordering what they wanted to eat from an extensive menu. Jeff engaged the guests because he is so friendly. One of my friends commented on how Jeff and his food truck added a whole cool vibe to the shindig. The best part for me is I didn't have to worry about the food or food service. My friends loved having their own private food truck. It was a brilliant experience from start to finish. I highly recommend dum yum and Jeff for an unforgettable and unique party! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Also came with this weird chop/fork so you can eat your dish either way.  it was nice for a easy lunch that is not too filling. Food service was quick despite 5 other orders before mine.
