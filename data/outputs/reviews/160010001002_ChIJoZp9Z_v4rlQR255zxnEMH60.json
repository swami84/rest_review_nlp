We ordered dinner for 4 and picked up the meal at 3pm Christmas Eve. I was very excited to have this meal as the prime rib I\u2019ve had before at Capitol Cellars was delicious. This was not the case this time, as the Prime Rib slices were full of gristle and the flavor was off. The potatoes were not cooked all the way, completely raw on the bottom and I had to add cheese to it for more flavor. The winter vegetables were flavorless and the yellow sauce on it was butter???? Not sure, flavorless. The salad had a lot of brown pieces in it and there was a hair in with the rolls. The soup was delicious, as was the cheesecake. For spending $236 + $50 dollar cash tip for the staff, this was disappointing and almost inedible.  Just figured someone might want to know as I see your doing the same thing for a NYE package which we will not be ordering. Photos for your review. ***I sent this exact email to Management GM??? giving 7 days to respond and did not hear a word back. Nothing. Almost $300 and we basically had 1 cup of soup/person and 1 piece of cheesecake/person for out Christmas Dinner, the rest was inedible.",

My first impression with the service was that my hostess was snooty, after I inquired information regarding seating in light of COVID-19. As for the price of the food, it is undoubtedly overpriced. The presentation was wonderful, but after the first bites of their special steak, it was unsavory and undercooked to the temperature I had requested. One of the most underwhelming and most expensive steak dinners I have had in the Treasure Valley. Very disappointed and frankly, I will never go back.",

The appetizer was pretty good. Then we waited another 40 min for our main dishes. We asked for bread it came without butter. I guess they don\u2019t normally serve bread. The main dishes were not good the chicken was pretty dry. The mashed potatoes were under seasoned and cold the cauliflower which was their special vegetable was supposed to be roasted it was barely blanched still raw and not seasoned or buttered and was not roasted at all. The au gratin potatoes were so salty you couldn\u2019t even eat them. Lamb chops two were not even cooked. I was wondering why we waited so long for the undercooked cold food. Such a huge disappointment! They asked if we wanted dessert which should have been on the house after waiting over an hour for our meal. But was not offered to us in that way. Sadly we will not be returning.",

I have never been more disappointed in my life with a restaurant as I was with our experience. What we got was an overpriced dinner of dry/bland sea bass and chicken. The rice had zero seasoning and the same could be said of the pasta that came with the chicken. My wife had to ask for the marinara sauce just to eat any of the pasta. I will not be recommending Capitol Cellars to any of my friends for the amount of money spent ($100).",

It all tasted very great and we even enjoyed 2 desserts that were great. This was my Third visit for dinner. All very enjoyable. Service is great and atmosphere is awesome. My next visit will be for brunch. They have added that to their offerings. Also an outside patio. This is so far my favorite restaurant in Boise. Pricing is very fair.",

This basement level restaurant is highly rated and gives homage to many of its past Idaho political figures.  Since we were a large group, we were offered a prix fixe menu. We had a choice between a caesar salad or french onion soup for a starter. Then we chose among a locally raised barramundi (fish), prime rib, or a three-cheese and chicken pasta. Finishing with a choice between diablo cake or creme brulee.  Bob and I both enjoyed the french onion soup. The bowls were generously topped with a thick piece of baguette covered in oven-melted cheese. The broth was a tad bit sweet due to the variety of onions used.  I tried the fish entree, which the waiter had really encouraged. Apparently the barramundi is a variety of sea bass that can either be raised in saltwater or freshwater. This fish is grown in a geothermal body of water north of Boise. The state is also very proud of the sturgeon they raise in these waters that lucratively provide cash crops of high-end caviar. This story encouraged me to try the fish, but it was disappointing. The piece of fish was pretty small, not much flavor, and was fried a little too much. Bob had the chicken pasta dish. It was incredibly rich, resembling a really creamy alfredo. Those who ordered the prime rib were really impressed! I'm so sad I didn't order that.  The diablo cake was decadent. Although not a devil's food cake nor spicy in nature as the name might suggest, this flourless chocolate torte really hit the spot! We had a bite of a neighbor's creme brulee, and it was excellent!  When I return, I promise to try the beef option!",

The  limited menu was varied, so we all got to try something different.  Each was prepared and presented with care.  The wait staff were impeccable and their recommendations spot on!  A truly enjoyable experience.  Prices are on the higher end, especially for their domestic wines, but it was money well spent.

I highly recommend the filet mignon (a seasonal), which was buttery soft and barely required any effort to cut apart. The loaded baked potato isn't anything to scoff at either.

I made the mistake of reading the menu an hour before our reservation and planning my decadent meal.  Everything I wanted was gone by the time we sat down for our meal.  My expectations dashed. \ud83d\ude22  The staff was very kind, and took a dessert and an appetizer off the bill since my main course (steak) and two of the three appetizers our group wanted were no longer available.  I appreciated that.  I did enjoy my appetizer and my soup, but I was still hungry when I got home.  I also have a hard time hearing and this place is loud.  They also do not serve spirits.  Great wine and kind staff.",

But the evening did not start well. I had made reservations but did not realize they had any bar height tables and chairs which I don't care for. There is one, and we were seated there. We were told that was all that was available. There was a table set for 4 next to it, and we assumed it was reserved for a party of 4. Five minutes later a young couple arrived. They quickly cleared 2 places off the table for 4 and sat the 2 of them there. The noise level was also quite high. We had a fairly loud party of 6 sitting next to us, and the place was full, so the noise detracted from the intimacy of the meal. There was a blonde lady/hostess kind of wandering around, and she was rather snippy with my friend. After dinner when we were leaving, my friend asked for a toothpick. Same lady gave him a very nasty look before handing one to him. Seems like when you have just laid down $70+, you should be treated better than snide looks. We won't go back. Will only recommend with caveats.",

I asked our waitress if it would be possible for us to move and she was so nice and accommodating about it. The staff apologized to us for the situation (which wasn't even their fault) and brought us out a free appetizer. That really impressed me.  The food was delicious.
