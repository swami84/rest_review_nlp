I called to express my frustration and the guy wouldn't even let me finish my sentence before talking over me to say \"well do you want your money back or to make a new one\". When I ordered a new one (because the rice is generally good) I walked in and shared that it was an inconvenience. Instead of apologizing, He decided to ARGUE with me and said \"You are the only one who complain\". He said everyone else wants me to make it \"well done\". This was NOT well done, it was burnt and this was MY food - not everyone else's. I am most disappointed that he decided to ARGUE with me about my order. I was a regular but now I am no longer going to use their services. There should have been a thank you for using our services especially during a pandemic but instead there was a slammed door in my face. Very disrespectful and unacceptable.

The fastest way to get your food is to call in your order and then come pick it up yourself. Delivery can take way too long, so you should avoid it if you can. Lots of other reviews have mentioned long wait times regardless, which is completely true, but these folks work out of a really small kitchen, so try to be patient and understand they can only fulfill so many orders at a time. In my experience, the food is always worth the wait. Also, if you pay with a debit card, remember to bring some cash for a tip!",

        "caption": "By the way,  Kira, don't use Grubhub and you might not have the problems that you had. I have lived in both Seattle and San Francisco and both have incredible Chinese food. Some of the restaurants are world famous there. I didn't give this place a 5 star rating, but 4 stars are pretty dog-gone good, and for the vegetables I will give it 5 stars. This is NOT mediocre food everybody, not at all: Kira is wrong here on that. Kira, I really suggest trying them again. It's actually quite delicious food. I was needing some mixed vegetables and chicken and they cooked up a really nice dish for me with all of my favorite vegetables. That was a really nice dish. It's a different flavor because it has a little bit of smoked flavor to it. That was a surprise; and it first I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was actually really good. The very fresh vegetables almost had a roasted taste to them. That might explain the smoked flavor. Thank God they were not overcooked at all. They are really crunchy and tasty. Yum ! I also ordered a hot and sour soup which turned out to be very good as well but it had a surprise too: it was a little bit sweet. This is a very good choice for a different restaurant when you have gone to your favorite chinese restaurant one too many times and have taste bud burnout. And I was feeling pretty bad before I ate. This is healthy food because I'm feeling a lot better...a lot better. I will go back again, and I'm a picky eater. Also it's a very good value for the price. One more thing, now that I have finished dinner: I have to say that this is my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. I'm thrilled. This out did my other favorite restaurant, especially for the vegetables. Congratulations!",

I called the restaurant, and they said they'd send the driver back with the correct item. More than an hour later, I still hadn't heard back from anyone. When I called back, I was told they hadn't seen the driver since I called the first time. The man I spoke to kept making excuses and never made any kind of offer to rectify the situation. On top of that, the food is mediocre, at best. I will not be ordering from here in the future.",
