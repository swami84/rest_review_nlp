The dressing on my salad was all over the chips and sandwich which I didn\u2019t prefer. Everything was drenched. The meats were Nice and tender, but it was masked bc they used way too much garlic aioli. Sometimes less is best.

When I went back to the counter to let them know I was concerned about the milk, I was treated as if I was trying to cheat them and get a free drink. One woman behind the counter ordered her co-worker to sip the milk they used and they said it was fine, and tried to make me pay for a brand new drink. I told them it didn\u2019t seem fair, as I didn\u2019t even drink this one and was clearly not trying to pull any scheme on them and she just told me she\u2019s not allowed to give me any free giveaways, since she has given others the same milk in drinks and no one else had complained. After looking for a relaxing breakfast with friends I was left feeling very uncomfortable by such unnecessary rude and cold distrust. I will not be returning.",
