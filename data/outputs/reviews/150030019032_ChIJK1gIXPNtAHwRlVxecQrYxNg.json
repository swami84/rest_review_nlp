Kenny the owner is always so nice and accommodating while his wife is hard at work cooking, during the lockdown they helped me find other options aside from my regular items. The lemon beef salad, Ong Choi, Barbecue pork, and curry are now going to be part of my regular rotation of what love to order in addition to Pho. Today I had a special plate with chicken, pork, a fried egg (runny) served on rice with veggies. Sooo gooood.

Their banh mi is delicious, too, chock full of pickled veggies, tender meat and plenty of cilantro (as it should be!)  I\u2019d ignore a lot of these one-star reviews, people moaning because they didn\u2019t open right on time or the lady at the counter was curt with them (to that person I say, do not go to Vietnam if that style of speaking intimidates you\u2026 this isn\u2019t the Cheesecake Factory) but no one can argue with the quality of ingredients and overall taste, which is superb, nor the reasonable prices, which are hard to find on this part of Oahu.

We decided to walk over and check it out.  The place was a little divey but those places can sometimes be the best finds ever. The guy that took our order was very nice and sweet.  We ordered the Thin Pork Sirloin with shredded pork, fresh vegetables over Vermicelli Noodles which was very good. A few Shrimp spring rolls with a peanut dipping sauce which were really fresh. I loved the peanut sauce. We also got some Wok'd vegetables to be a little healthy. We ended up not order the Pho because it was so hot outside and we didn't feel like carrying a hot bowl of soup back to our balcony.  We had ourselves a nice little feast on the balcony as we watched the surfers and the boats in the harbor. Good food with an amazing view. Life doesn't get any better then this.",
