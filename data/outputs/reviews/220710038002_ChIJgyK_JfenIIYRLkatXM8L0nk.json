Later, I get a call that my request for a table near a window may not be able to be fulfilled, which was understandable and I agreed to take seats at the bar or whatever becomes available first. The app tells me to go check in at the restaurant, so we did. The host tells us that they'll text us once our table is ready. We left to go check out some stores and we finally get a text our table is ready. We arrive at the restaurant again and there is one couple in front of us at the host's desk. The host goes to seat that couple, and I happen to see that my name was before theirs on the wait list. The host returns and I give her my name. She looks at the list, sees that there are no more tables open, and by the look on her face I see that she realized she just gave our table away. It's been well over an hour as this point. I said aloud to my boyfriend that they just gave our table away. The host says our table isn't ready yet. Then why did I get a text 5 minutes ago stating that it was? The manager (I think) steps in and covers their mistake by saying, \"You wanted a table by a window, right?\" On the phone I clearly stated that I would take whatever becomes available first. So we wait another 10-15 minutes. We were so hungry that we hoped the food would make up for this, but we were wrong. The food was mediocre and one side of my stuffed French toast was too burnt for consumption. There are better places to eat breakfast in this beautiful city.",

We inquired at the host stand, and she told us that there were three more parties in front of us. When we told her that both those parties were behind us, she got argumentative. We told her we were going somewhere else and to take us off the list. Twenty minutes later she called us and said our table was ready, to which we replied that we were already eating somewhere else, and hung up. Then she proceeded to call us again.

It was really nice being able to amp up the flavour of the dish by using more decadent butter and cayenne. Most restaurants do not season food enough, so putting the guest in control was awesome.

The chicken and waffles. They are seriously some of the beat chicken and waffles I\u2019ve ever had. The chicken was juicy, hot and crispy and the waffles were light and delicate. The spicy butter it\u2019s served with really ties it all together. I highly recommend this dish. It would also be a good appetizer for 4 people who just want a taste. The aebleskivers are fun and delicious. They\u2019re like a softer pancakier beignet. I really enjoyed the lemon curd ones.",

Maybe it's just me but I dont like a warm side salad or fruit...  I was served at the bar where I could see my food on the counter but no servers were picking up there orders. The location is a small restaurant. I was not the only one recieving terrible service. My friend didnt even receive the side order of egg she asked for.  After finishing off our waters and stairing at our waitress we hoped she would come by and refill us after 5 minutes we got up and grab ourselves water.  Finally done with French toast and the service we wanted to leave and let other people who were waisting there time in line that wrapped all the way outside there chance to be disappointed.  After another 10 minutes and raising our hand, we got the check. We handed over our 3 credit cards and asked to pay for our own meal instead she split the bill 3 ways.  The 3 of us that sat at the bar arrived 5 mins after they opened. We left after 1 and 20mins. Clearly the people who work here at a breakfast restaurant are not morning people.  ***Take my review with a grain of salt I experience my service the day after Mardi gras***",

We got the food, and it was standard French toast, eggs etc, nothing too special.  One person ordered steak and it was extremely undercooked. He goes back to get the steak fixed, which they do. But when he asked for a refill of juice so he can drink with his breakfast (since it took a while to fix) they said that would be extra money. Long story short, not great customer service. You could tell they were stretched thin. The only reason I give two stars is because you could tell the hostess felt bad for our wait.",

        "caption": "Well who would not want to eat at a restaurant named after a famous New Orleans dish- Pain Perdu? Let me begin by saying the building and d\u00e9cor are beautiful old French New Orleans. The space felt very pleasing, sunny, and inviting. The staff..... well bless their hearts, they seemed lost in the headlights. The food was sub-par for New Orleans where you better be good buddy or adios. So we both started with plain jane lattes which we both found to be quite good. I ask the waitress some specifics about our delicious lattes and her response was.....\" it comes from a machine over there\". Well I delved a little deeper and she simply was lost in the headlights again. Anyway we both had savory crepes- me Florentine and my spouse Mushroom, onion, peppers, spinach, and chevre. Now I  have eaten my fair share of crepes in the past (Defunct Petunias in the Quarter served divine, light crepes) and these things were somewhere between an omelet and a crepe and not really to my liking. I must say the ingredients of the crepe themselves were somewhat complex and tasty. It was like a different taste sensation with each bite. The side dish of fruit was good and the sunny side eggs came out as I ordered. My spouse had over easy eggs and he did not experience horrific gastritis as did I a few hours after leaving the Quarter, so I suspect that my eggs were just a bit too under cooked. Another thing I liked about French Toast was that they brought out a carafe of iced water which reminded me of Paris as did the d\u00e9cor to some extent. So to summarize: the d\u00e9cor is lovely, the staff is rather inexperienced, the food was overall average, and the bill was mid-range.",
