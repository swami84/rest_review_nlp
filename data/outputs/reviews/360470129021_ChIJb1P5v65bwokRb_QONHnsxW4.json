To sit at a table we needed a reservation however we arrived within a sweet spot time. Next reservation coming in was in an hour and half. More than enough time to grab some dinner. For drinks we had the ginger plum cold tea. I feel in love with the first taste (also available in hot)  They don't deal with milk products so no half and half available. No white rice available only purple but tastes like brown rice . The glasses offered for drinking water were dirty so I have to give them back to our waiter.  Open kitchen so the entire restaurant is engulfed in a clear  billow of korean aroma",

I was so excited to try this place the video i saw on youtube and the pics on the website really made it look like it was going to be quite an experience. Meal presentation was very nice, prices were ok, i didnt like that you had to pay extra for banchan which im very accustomed getting along with any meal ordered at Korean restaurants i go to in Ga. On a whole kool looking space, service was good, first time eating Korean food its ok, but if you've eaten at other more authentic places you might be disappointed.
