Salmon, tuna, yellowtail, sweet shrimp, sea urchin, king crab, you name it, all fresh. They have THE BEST red surf clam I've ever tasted - SWEET, TENDER, and JUICY. We ordered the sushi sashimi combo, omakase, uni ikura don, eel don, and a few appetizers. Both quantity and quality are better than any other Japanese fusion restaurant we've been to. You just can't beat the value. We couldn't finish everything so we packed the leftovers to go.  We were welcomed by the owner. Simon is the man. He gave us free beers and free desserts! Amazing desserts by the way! We signed up for their free membership  and will definitely go there again. I strongly recommend everyone to try this place!

        "caption": "(Longer review on yelp due to google lower character number limit).  Place's spacious, at least felt like it due to being nearly empty. Just 3 tables with 2 people each (including us), odd for 7/8pm on a weekend, ie. \"peak\" dinner time.  Ambiance Not bad, feels too \"modern generic\". Nothing exuded specific style not asian, nor fusion, comes across as lacking personality. \"Fusion\" in the name sets expectations for decor, unclear what elements are involved birthing this culinary \"alloy\". Applies to look, atmosphere, food. Not inherently a negative, just confusing and a missed opportunity to craft and leverage a well defined character identifying the place and drawing in patrons. Sport bar feel conveyed by large the TVs showing sports, news, farm animals documentaries, doesn't help its case.  The lack of style didn't bother us much, but music played did. While not trash metal, it wasn't a pleasant background filler either, nor an easy listening, or relaxing selection. Instead was rather annoying/aggressive contemporary teen-pop played on the too-loud-for-comfort side. We wouldn't mind upbeat music and it's not like we'd be expecting Vivaldi's Four Seasons to be the sound bed accompanying dinner at a self-defining \"fusion\" restaurant... unless that was fusing with a mid 1700 theme that is! :D The loudness and selection was just borderline unbearable as background music and it also had the effect to immediately turn the feel of the place into a \"Queens, bubble tea shop catering to teenagers\" and to be clear, there is nothing wrong with that, provided we had stepped inside such an establishment.  Everything in a restaurant plays a role. From decor to music, to food quality to service, including how everything is handled by everyone involved in any interaction with patrons coming to dine at a given establishment. Any of the items above can become disruptive to the overall experience.  It's not terribly difficult to be a nice restaurant in a newly developed neighborhood, even when missing on the opportunity of using the decor of the place as a point of leverage. We're not talking about trying to be \"upscale\", just nice and pleasant alone would already a brilliant achievement on its own! For upscale, overpriced, pretentious there are already quite a few in the close by areas that shall remain unnamed. Sadly there the overcharging for average to good food is a necessity given the outrageous cost of rents... therefore quite sadly in most such places the word \"spectacular\" will mostly apply to the bill one will end up paying.  Price Speaking of high prices, here is where instead we saw one upsides of 66S Fusion. Their pricing (so far) while not \"cheap\", was quite reasonable, provided the portions will remain the same in future.  Service Going back to the service, as the place wasn't busy, one would have thought service would be more attentive and food would arrive quickly. Not the case. Wait staff was \"average friendly\", but failed to acknowledge us while waiting more than what would be reasonable especially due to (again) being nearly empty. Wouldn't expect special treatment or freebies, a simple update would've been enough. Also no \"discrete courtesy check\" was ever done to see if we needed anything and if food was to our liking.  Waited 30 min. for first entree (Ramen). Sashimi arrived much later in a \"grandiose\" presentation, but was pretty good.  It's unfortunate we got the appetizer after first entree, defeating the point of ordering one. Likely forgotten or prep timing was poorly managed could've been held and finished once we were done with the appetizer, with the upside that doing so both entrees would have come at the same time.  Food Ramen: definitely not \"rich\", nor flavorful albeit not entirely tasteless Appetizer: squid 2-way was 3/4 one way, 1/4 another. Squid was medium/large and tender, 3/4 was served in teriyaki-like sauce. Taste was tiring after a couple rings, another 5 rings were battered and fried, missing lemon at the very least. Sushi/Sashimi: Over-presented, but delicious. Portions were satisfying.",

Please see the photo, there's nothing regular about a plate of fresh fish on ice lit by blue light :) Our main dishes were Pork Lo Main, amazing comfort food taste, and Pork and Rice, again a mix of modern and tradicional flavors that played incredibly well. We can definitely recommend this restaurant for all visiting NY or living nearby :)",

        "caption": "I live around the corner and it's convenient to have a decent sushi joint merely a block away. I have ordered take-out multiple times and dined in once during lunch special hours. The food quality is excellent all-around. The staff is attentive and friendly. Price-wise, it's similar to the inferior sushi restaurants on Myrtle Avenue so no reason to go the places on Myrtle.  Will try dining-in for dinner with friends and/or family soon.",
