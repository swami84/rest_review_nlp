The sashimi was cut very thick, maybe twice as big as what you get elsewhere. I was very amazed at the size of the eel, definitely twice as big as usual. The California Roll was also very generous with a big portion of crab and a thin layer of rice. Very expertly made too.  In the D4, the tako sushi had gotten replaced by a nari (I had already eaten it by the time a took a picture). I also noted that the seaweed was slightly stale, but still edible. I make allowances for this since we are still being impacted by covid. Quality will probably go up to 5 star worthy after the pandemic is over.  When we went for pickup, everyone was wearing masks. They provide a pen that they sanitize after each use (it has its own tray that the cashier sprays with alcohol).  Overall, will definitely come again!",
