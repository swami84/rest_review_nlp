Ordered two pounds of snow crab legs in the garlic butter!  Let me tell you these were the prettiest and most delicious legs I\u2019ve had in a minute! Date ordered the NY strip steak with garlic noodles and broccoli!  Another win. Would definitely go again and explore other menu options.",

The food was awesome, we started with a couple appetizers and i must say the crab cakes are amazing and full of meat. The shrimp were juicy and big. The snow crab legs and lobster was on point as well. The prices weren't too bad for a seafood restaurant in the city. If your on the fence about visiting. Do it.",

We have been ordering delivery/take-out and hope to return sometime to indoor dining (and enjoy their great cocktail menu).  In the meantime, it's a GREAT restaurant for take-out.

For the main course we ordered the Fishermen Combo and was instantly  hypnotized by the juicy and mouthwatering Snow Crabs, Shrimp(with the heads off) and succulent Cajun Kielbasa Sausage, Corn on the Cob, Cajun Potato, & Dumpling. The staff's attention to detail was impeccable, alongside their welcoming disposition. The Boilery is a welcome addition to the Upper Westside. Try it out you will not regret it!

While we are not a fan of fruity, sweet cocktails, this was really good and not sweet, and was highly recommended by the waiter. We had another round. For app, we just had the grilled oysters that were cooked perfectly.  We then had the Signature Boilery Trio and an order of crawfish.  Nice size shrimps.  We found the seafood to be very fresh.  They came with the standard potato and corn, but also with rice cake which we really enjoyed.  We have been to a few boil places in the city and think this is one of the best.",

I had snow crabs with shrimps(44), snow crags(29), 3 drinks, dozen of raw clams, and sausage. The boilery signature sauce was not tasty, it was too watery. It seems as if the pour the sauce ontop of the seafood instead of letting it marinate. Its a nice place to dine with a significant other. The drinks were average, tasty, but not strong. They do not give alot of sausages. The gratuity is not included. The staff were extremely courteous. However, today was my first and last time going there.
