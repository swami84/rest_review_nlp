The waiter was spread a little thin but she did a good job.  Everything was great until we went upstairs. We were standing near the side of bar when a waitress/bartender sprayed me with water and drenched the back of my dress, legs, and shoes. I was soaked. I turned around nicely and told her she sprayed me. As opposed to apologizing she was very indifferent and told me I shouldn't be standing there anyway. I asked for a manager.  Instead of him apologizing initially, he gave me a spill about how I shouldn't have been standing there and \"that's what the rope is for\", etc. Mind you the rope is facing the front not the side walkway which is where I was. I told him a simple apology would have been suffice. He apologized and sent us a round of shots of wine (why wine?).  Here's my biggest problem with what happened today: The waiter that drenched me walked over to me after everything was said a done and gave me a very dramatic and insincere apology. I looked at her and said nothing. She walked off then walked behind me and whispered in my ear \"you did all that and wanted an apology and didn't even accept it, humph\". This is not how you do business! She was out of line and the way the whole situation was handled should have been better.",

It was 11am and champagne bottles were being popped from every section of party like it was New Years Eve. The entry fee included unlimited champagne. It doesn't get any better than that. The we were several  DJ's that revolved throughout the day playing, Hip hop, top 40's, Afrobeat, dancehall, etc. They played all kinds of great music mixes and everyone hit the dance floor. Fremont is my favorite day party in Chi-town thus far.",

Our experience soured on our way out as we were harassed by an employee and told, \u201cwe should leave faster\u201d when the restaurant was closing. After correcting him, he continued to aggressively talk s#!+. In retrospect, I really wish I'd found out his name. After paying an $1800 bill you'd expect a much kinder level of customer service, but even if we paid $18 we were paying guests at this establishment and should have been treated as such.  This was my first visit and for the most part it was ok, but this will be my last visit. I phoned the restaurant to formally complain and never received a response. I believe in paying and tipping well to guarantee a great experience when I dine out. I am never ok with inferior service and/or power trips from unhappy, incompetent, poorly trained staff. I've told my friends and colleagues to take their business to HighLine on Kinzie. Both the food and service are 5x's better.",

At times the refills on sparkling wine were super slow but overall it was fine.  I\u2019m not a fan of drinking Champagne out of a plastic \u201cglass\u201d. The water was in plastic and the coffee was in paper cups. I wasn\u2019t at a picnic outdoors or poolside. Why can\u2019t I have a real glass or china cup for my coffee?  The caliber of food for this brunch was not all quite up to par. A tortilla chips and salsa/nacho bar? Hot dogs and Italian beef?  The omelette station was great. The bacon was delicious. The carved turkey and sausage were very nice. The brisket was very tough and overdone.  It was very loud and not conducive to socializing with your group while dining. Not sure why the DJ and club music can\u2019t kick in after brunch.  It wasn\u2019t bad but it wasn\u2019t great either. I wouldn\u2019t go back.  I\u2019d pay extra and go to Maple & Ash. Now that\u2019s my kind of brunch.",

The food was AMazing! As soon as the Club scene started we were excited! The entire experience took a sharp turn as one of the bridesmaids had her Chase card declined for her bill and put on a security hold. She works downtown so was confused as to how this could happen. While she called Chase to solve the problem, the bus boys and waitress swarmed the table without really saying a word & spilled our drinks almost wetting the Bride! Of course the bride was upset it was very disrespectful. After attempting to contact Chase with no luck, there was quick pay  & a second bridesmaid used her card she uses in the area frequently & ALSO had a lock put on her card! After this we we're getting irritated as it was obviously the machine at the bar and the waitresses were pretty much pushing us off to the bartenders. Finally one of the girls withdrew money from the ATM there for an extra $7. Even after the terrible experience after brunch, we were courteous enough to tip 20%  & really enjoyed the DJ.",

Once it hits about 12 noon the whole atmosphere changes into a clubish type atmosphere. The food was also great! So much to choose from! There was one bad thing that happened, you only get to sit at your table for 2 hours, which is fine. Well when it came time for us to move from the table about 2 bus boys and multiple servers came and just started abruptly and rudely grabbing everything off  the table! One server even spilled OJ all over the table and almost all over myself! They could have nicely told us that it was time to leave the table as we knew we only had 2 hours and that was fine rather rudely grabbing everything and basically saying get the f off the table! I was a server for  a long time and I would never do that to anyone, it was completely rude and uncalled for! I may return again but that really changed my opinion about the restaurant.",

The dessert bar was too pretty to touch, but I did try something. The downstairs is more restaurant-like, while the upstairs is more club/bar-like, and the two complemented each other perfectly!

I AM DEFINITELY NOT A LIAR!!!  I was extremely disappointed during my last visit at Fremont on 6/30.  We are regular customers who usually sit upstairs in the booths next to the windows.  However, I will never patronize this establishment again.  Long story short, one of our guests were harassed at the front door, yelled at and threatened with gun violence.  He was also told that \"his money is no good there.\"  This is despite the fact that we frequent Fremont and have spent a good deal of money there already.  The issue was that our reservation was under the promoter's name.  When our guest arrived, he gave the name of the person who made the reservations.  They made him wait in the rain until we came down.  By the time we got downstairs and tried to rectify the situation, door security was very disrespectful.  They would not listen to us at all!  There was one taller black guy and a shorter Hispanic guy.  I overheard the Hispanic door security tell his boss that \"this guy doesn't know the name under his reservation.\"  Though we had already informed him of the promoter's name, he did not relay that information to his boss and made it seem like the reservation name was still unknown.  I believe at that point, he was irritated with the situation and took it upon himself to decide that our guest would not be coming in. After having to wait this out in the rain, the head of security came out and provided absolutely no customer service.  He started belittling our guest and threatening him with his gun.  The situation escalated and we ended up leaving early after still paying a $900 bill, leaving the first bottle we had just purchased and canceling the second that was on the way!  Our guest that received this treatment is a tall, black man who owns numerous LEGAL businesses.  I am not sure what kind of money Fremont wants at their establishment, but it was made clear that it wasn't his/ours!!!  I strongly suggest you get a head of security that does not prefer to incite anger.  In the times we live today, just about everyone has a gun! Bringing such a deadly tool up in a misunderstanding of words is extremely cowardly and unprofessional!  Management should never resort to THREATENING patrons with gun violence, especially when they are outside of the property!  Management should be trained to deescalate situations.  Lastly, just to reiterate, the comment about not needing \"his type of money\" was clearly racist to me!!  I find racism very saddening, but even more when it comes from another minority!  I will NEVER understand that!",

Lots of tables are reserved but there was room at the bar. Keep your plate and silverware! Enjoy yourself and get the mimosas! We will be back as soon as we can. Not kid friendly really. Great DJ pumping upstairs! Seriously the fee is worth it for the in-house pastry chef's inventions alone. Recommend!",

I highly recommend this place and strongly suggest making a reservation because they do sell out Very Quick.

And, to make sure we would have a spot for our party, I tried many times on different days to reach out to the reservation team with no response back. I left a voicemail to confirm our party a few days before Sunday and got no call back. But I had an email with our options for Sunday, and responded with what I wanted and at that point I\u2019m assuming that my reservation was all set! WRONG! we arrived at the Fremont, and when we tried to check in; the hostess could not find my name in their system, I showed them my email to confirm that I did received a response from them. When they called the manager they informed me that there\u2019s was nothing they could do unless there were cancellations in the next hour. While we were there we saw many empty tables, and told them we were flexible to sit in many separate tables, but we were told that was also not an option. Joe, one of the managers, took over the situation to made it worse with his attitude because he was unwilling to see that we had been trying to reach out for days with no response. I believe that Fremont could have done something for us in helping us get into the place in any spot but chose not to, the quality of the place should reflect on the poor management. All we wanted was to celebrate a special 40th bday for my sister, we left the place with a very bad impression from JOE the manager as he shrugged us off when we told him we were going to leave cause they weren\u2019t letting us know of other options.",

I'm not sure if this was intentional or human error but the barmen did not give me the right change which I was short $11 and my party left over $15-20 in tips separately.

We tried to make reservations online and the correspondence to get a spot was unhelpful at best. My mom tried calling 3 days prior to Sunday brunch and they did not respond to us at all. When we got there the manager, Joe, told my mom that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get in and would have to wait to see if other parties canceled (that we\u2019re coming an hour after the time we got there). He was very unhelpful and unaccommodating although there were plenty of tables available to sit in the VIP sections. We offered to split up our party to a few tables to make it better for them to sit us and they all told us no. While Joe talked to my mom he was very rude and told her that there was nothing he could do for us while all of the hosts stood there and talked badly about my mom and the situation. When my mom showed Joe the correspondence through email and proof of the calls, they said they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. If you\u2019re planning to come here with a large group and spend the money to treat your family to a boozy brunch, avoid this space at all costs unless you\u2019re willing to pay to sit in the VIP section (which is obviously what they want).",

It is $40 just for brunch and an additional $20 for bottomless mimosas, but definitely worth the price. Everything from the omelet station, to the donut wall, to vegetarian options, there is something for everyone so if you leave hungry and/or too sober, that's YOUR own fault. Dress code is 'smart casual' aka NO SWEATS, dirty gym shoes etc. Basically, wear some nice jeans, a  cute top (stylish boots if winter) otherwise no basic gym shoes. They have a dj that is playing a nice mix of today's hits and everyone who works here is so genuinely pleasant. I will be back and will definitely recommend this place!! Thanks Fremont!!  *Almost forgot: if your reservation is at a set time, you have your table for 2 hours STARTING from your reserved time, NOT the time you sat down so BE ON TIME for reservations!! You're more than welcome to stay after your time, just have to give up the table. Finding a place at the bar afterwards was easy, but then again we got there early (between 10am & 11am). The place is worth the price!!",

We had reservations at 12:00 PM, but we were only allowed to be at out table for 2 hrs, regardless we were told we could stay for bottomless mimosas until 4pm which we did. Donut wall and boozy desserts are my fave. There is a decent variety of food , I am vegetarian and there is veggie friendly options. My second visit was something very last minute. It was only me and my husband and we did not make reservations. The hostess said they were completely booked but had space in bar areas upstairs and downstairs. We sat in the downstairs bar, and Miranda took care of us. She was super attentive, friendly and made our visit more enjoyable.  She shared with us some of her favorite foods and best of all always kept our glasses full. Hope to see her when I do come back. Overall the earlier you come, the more you get for your money.",

The fresh cut fries and the two sauces it came with we're great as well, flat breads the crew seemed to enjoy the pepperoni over the sausage, order them well done next time. I didn't try the rest of the spread but the party of 18 enjoyed it.

I was only able to try an omelette and 2 mimosas by the time a bouncer accused me of  dumping pulp from my cup over the balcony. I was not given a chance to explain myself and was automatically escorted out. The Manager actually said I could have hurt someone passing by. Everyone in my party tried to say something but the manager just kept saying no. I tried to explain I had just sat down to eat and asked for a refund then and they would not budge and even kicked out another friend for trying to defend me. I could understand if I was being drunk and obnoxious, which many people were, but no they singled me out (easy to do when your skin is brown in a sea of white). Trust me do not come here and put up with incompetent management. They do not care about you. This is Snobby elite-ism at its finest.",

We were told our reservations were only for two hours, and we could go upstairs,  or to the bar on the first level. Really after trying to get reservations for three months, they rushed  me to eat. But, to top it off they served Champagne in plastic  flutes! The brunch was $40.00, unlimited Champagne was an additional $20.00!  Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon!",

So I did my research and thought this place would be awesome. I seen a lot if my friends talk about it I googled reviews and checked out your IG and  fb page the pictures and everything looked nice. I made my reservation on open table for 10:45pm I figured a late dinner and we can go upstairs to the club I called and emailed Fremont to make sure everything was set up! No call back or no email back so we head there about 10:30pm and of course food is not being served .... why would you allow me to make an reservation for 2 if your not serving food???  So I go back to reviews and she's a TON of other people saying the same thing. They made a reservation and when they showed up they got  the cold shoulder and was turned away along with a lot of minorities saying they were  Discriminated against them because of their race and when we entered I seen them turn away two African Americans with dreads dressed like everyone else!!! Not drunk not rude just trying to get inside.... maybe because they were a different color smh!!! So here I am stating the same thing I seen all over on other review pages I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO FREMONT AGAIN!!!",

Went for a friends birthday party in a group of 25 and they were able to accommodate us on the upper level. $40 for all you can eat and $20 for all you can drink champagne.  Upstairs,in fair weather, the rooftop is opened to spectacular views of the nearby skyscrapers. DJs rotate through different sets keeping the dance floor interesting. It was college football season for my visit on a Saturday and every TV was tuned to a game. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a Saturday/Sunday daytime party. \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf78",

We did the bottomless mimmosa and brunch. It was $80 so we were planning on staying until 3pm. All the dancing was upstairs and we wanted to dance. When we paid our bill and tried to go upstairs they tried saying that we need a stamp. When we asked the hostess and our waitress. The hostess acted like she had no idea what we were talking about and our waitress was trying to avoid us. I just think it's crazy that multiple people told us that we were able to go upstairs to drink and when the time came everyone was acting stupid. I would never go back again. There are plenty of other places in Chicago that are fun and much better service. Also the waitress said that Jameson shots were $5 and when the bill came they were not $5.",
