How you measure the quality of service is not when it's normal, but when they make a mistake. They forgot a slice on our order, which makes sense since they were slammed, normaly this would lead to extra hassle of getting back in line and getting another. This didnt happen, instead, no questions asked, they gave me 2 on the house. That is the service you would get at a 5 star restaurant, and you get it here. Curtis is the man.",

I asked that the food be made fresh and sent out.  I was assured it would be.  It arrived 20 minutes later and the wings were room temperature.  They offered a refund, but their incompetence was such that I honestly didn't want them interacting with my bank account any more than they already had.  I have had many great experiences with Wise Guys in the past and am sadly disappointed that I will not have any in the future.",

The ingredients are fresh/high quality so it beats Pie Hole and Guido's.  Most of what Idaho offers in pizza is horrible. If you're raised on dog food, you think dog food is good.  Many locals like a bread-like crust and lacking/tasteless sauce.  You can get that at Smokey Mountain, Idaho Pizza Co, Flying Pie, and other local chains. There are other \"artisan\" pizza choices which can be tasty but you don't get much and most of the time I want a pizza with traditional toppings.  I have tried them all in Boise, lived all over the USA, and as an accused pizza snob, Wiseguy is in the top % for Boise.",

Not even five minutes after sitting down the owner came over and slammed down a menu on our table and said \"this is not a charity, order something or get out!\" He went on for probably five more minutes before my husband interrupted him and said okay we get it we will get out. During his rant I couldn't help but mention the beer in his hand which might have had something to do with his wildly inappropriate behavior! I have been a waitress and I understand that if the restaurant is full you don't sit down and take a table that someone who is buying food can use. However, there were only four people in the restaurant total so I didn't think the owner would mind. I will NEVER go back to this place again and I encourage all my friends not to support a business with an owner that was so rude to his potential customers.",

We've ordered specialty pizzas from this shop 3-4 times prior and were disappointed in the execution with the toppings, but we ordered the Margarita Guy this time around thinking August in Boise would guarantee a good product.  Wrong.  Tomatoes were flavorless, obviously commercial, and not even remotely covered the pie although we're right in the middle of tomato season.  Basil was lacking and added little.  Overall, a flavorless pizza.  This is especially disappointing because other NY style pizza shops (Guido's for one) would charge half the price with twice the flavor on essentially the same pizza.  Wiseguy:  wake up and realize you are a small Idaho business in the middle of summer!  Even without dropping your ridiculous prices, you could take advantage of the local food movement, get amazing produce to feature on popular pies and KILL IT!  Please do.
