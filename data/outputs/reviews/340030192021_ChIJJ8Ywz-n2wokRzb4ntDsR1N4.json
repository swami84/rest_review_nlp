We ordered the mild spicy small one (with one hard boiled egg, sausage, and glass noodles). In addition we added Ramen noodles. It was spicy for us because we don't typically eat spicy food but our friend loved it. It was surprisingly good and the portion was big for two people. I ordered Donkatsu ( breaded fried pork cutlet with salad, mash potato, corn). It's very delicious and again the breaded fried pork was a large piece. The downside was that this is a cash only place, no free appetizers like other Korean restaurants, and the free preserved raddish, which come with Yupgi Topokki is upon request. Their parking lot is very tiny so be prepared to park on the street or a nearby parking lot.",

So we asked the lady who works there and she said that it's a side order. It wasn't a side order before, but they have changed it.  She was saying they are now using two container but it has about 60 ricecakes total.  We have counted it, but it was less than 50. The ingredients they have used also changed. The ricecake used to be thin and tastier, but now it's thick and it splits.  When you see a ricecake that splits like that, it means they are not fresh. Now they are not evening using the container that is being used by the original franchise. You can see that they try to cut the cost in many ways and yet the price of dduckbbokki hasn't dropped. Another cons about this place is that they only accept cash. If you want dduckbbokki, just buy one from grocery store and cook your own.  Instant dduckbbokki is tastier than Yupdduck",
