Now fifty years old, and dedicating the Restaurant in Fulton Market to his wife who introduced Virant to Okonomiyaki after years of study in Japan, guests will currently find Gaijin operating amidst COVID-19 precautions \u2013 social distancing assured from patio to Chef\u2019s Counter and staff exceedingly efficient.  The Windy City\u2019s first Okonomiyaki restaurant, but also home to Pickles, Shaved Ice and a serious Beverage program, it is amidst street style and modestly-loud Hip Hop that diners are invited to relax from 5pm Tuesday through Thursday and noon Friday till Sunday.  Capable of seating sixty, though currently limited to half-that, it was after some perusal that both Hiroshima and Osaka styles of the savory Japanese Pancake were ordered, their preparation just inches away showing far more complexity than some might expect and no shortage of traditional imported Ingredients.  Serious about the product\u2019s authenticity it was by request that Osaka-style was served first, a topping of Shrimp, Corn and spiced Butter all married to a fluffy base by Kewpie with no two bites the same while Hiroshima-style further incorporated chewy Yakisoba Noodles, Katsuobushi and Bacon atop a nearly-French Crepe on the bottom.  Lively even in inclement weather, staff still having fun while practicing all recommended safety measures, Dessert at Gaijin comes from Vie\u2019s Pastry Chef Angelyne Canicosa, the $5 Rice Flour Donut a questionable value in comparison to $12 for a snowcapped mountain of Shaved Ice wrapped around housemade Gooey Butter Cake Ice Cream and decorated in artisan accoutrements.",

The servers bring them and place then on a warming hot plate in the middle of your table. A normal size Okonomiyaki is enough for one person. They also have a sampler with smaller sized Okonomiyaki so you can try three different ones. The Kakigori isn\u2019t something you can easily find in Chicago so it is definitely worth a try. The sesame Yuzu was good, except the sesame brittle was way too overpowering in taste. Would definitely be back to try more things off the menu.",

We also ordered the octopus for entree and my daughter suggested to do it with crispy rice. It was not my favorite to be honest. Flavor was great but the texture was a bit too soft. One thing that you have to try is their spicy sauce. Delicious We sat by the kitchen counter which I highly recommend. You get to see everything as it's being cooked, interact with the chef abs in our case we fit some mochi samples as well. I would go again no questions asked",

It has condensed milk that you can pour over for an extra layer of decadence, but the ice itself is already so delicious. The best part was that we came early when it wasn\u2019t as busy and every person working there was friendly and super attentive.  Especially Jonie.  She really has a heart of hospitality and you could tell her team really enjoyed working with her.  Of everyone we encountered she made sure our party had everything we needed.  She showed us the clever storage in the seats, and even gave our baby daughter different toys to play with while we ate.  That's service that's above and beyond that you cannot find or teach. Thank you for a great night out, Jonie!",

Definitely need to make a reservation for weekend nights, but if you're lucky you might find a counter seat open up.  They might still be working out the timing of their reservations because we ended up waiting for 20 minutes despite having an 8pm Saturday night reservation. This wouldn't be so bad if their waiting area wasn't so small, and it was a freezing January night!  The Okonomiyaki is certainly something where your tastes can differ. So take a look at the menu and be prepared to try something new and different! I definitely preferred the traditional Hiroshima-style over the Osaka chicken oko. The food is made behind the counter, where you can watch if you have a seat there. Then it's brought out and set on your table, which is mostly a heated tray to keep them warm.  I'd recommend sharing them, and order more as you're getting close to finishing it. They'll just bring them out as they're prepared. The shaved ice desserts are tasty but not as good as the food.  All in all I'd like to go back and try some of the other options they have!",

I am glad that they gave us the option of sitting at the grill or at a booth. I got to take pictures of how the okonomiyaki was made. It was a fun time. The sakura tea was very fragrant and refreshing while eating the okonomiyaki. I personally like the Hiroshima style the most so far, though I might be biased since the first time I had okonomiyaki was in Hiroshima. I want to come back here to try more items on the menu. There was also shaved ice and donuts to try but I was too full. This was a great first 2020 restaurant meal of the new year. I'll be bringing my friends here for sure. Thank you to all the staff there!",

        "caption": "I think this place has a lot of promise, and I will likely return in the future, but I had several issues with my visit to Gaijin. Let me start off by saying, I LOVE okonomiyaki. It is my favorite Japanese dish and I lament the fact that it is so difficult to find in the U.S. When I heard there was a restaurant opening in my city that was dedicated to my favorite dish, I was VERY excited. We had a reservation for 3pm on Sunday for 6 people and we were seated very quickly. We put in an order for some appetizers and our main dishes. The appetizers were okay, we ordered the beef croquette and the short ribs. The short ribs were good but only two small pieces of meat, not worth the price. The beef croquette was good but others in my party were not as fond. Our okonomiyaki orders were taking a long time, so the waiter came over to offer us free drinks, no problem here. Eventually my tables food was delivered, except mine. I ordered a flight of three different okonomiyaki, and it took a LONG time. It was very clear that they had forgotten my order, but it does not appear that my forgotten order was put on \"rush\". I have cooked okonomiyaki at home and I have a good idea of how long it takes, and it does not take this long. I would estimate it took an extra 35-40min for my meal to arrive. I expect that they put my forgotten order on the back of the line to avoid having other patrons wait longer (as everyone was waiting a long time). By the time my meal finally arrived, everyone in my party had completely finished eating. Thankfully my meal was comped, but when I was so excited for this restaurant it was really discouraging to watch everyone around me eat while I sit around twiddling my thumbs. Regarding the meal itself, it was good okonomiyaki, but not AMAZING as I was hoping. The shrimp one was by far my favorite. Perhaps the best part of okonomiyaki is the delicious sauce it is served with, that I could barely taste on my dish. I really wish they would put extra sauce bottles on the tables so guests can add more. My waiter was fabulous and I could tell he felt bad, but it is clear that there are issues that need to be worked out in the kitchen. You can see everything being cooked from the table, and they have almost as many chefs as they have chairs in the restaurant. I am unsure of why their process is so inefficient. In the end they probably ended up giving us $40-$50 of free stuff because of their service issues. Maybe I will come back in a year when everything is worked out.",

My partner had to ask for the \u201cmanager\u201d (I say that loosely because she did not act like a manager), and when she did come over, she asked me what I\u2019d like to do about the fact that there had been a massive miscommunication in her non-busy establishment. When I finally got my food It was decent, but the restaurant is incredibly poorly run. Maybe It was a bad night, but the consensus was that based on our experience we definitely do not recommend nor will come back.",

Our party of two couldn't get a table so we just took the bar seat because we didn't want to wait. I could see everything in the open kitchen as the kitchen made the okonomiyaki. As starters we ordered the Beef Korokke and the Twice-Cooked Garlic & Senbei. The Beef Korokke was okay, kind of tasted like a falafe. The Twice Cooked Garlic was such a disappointment .The crackers were SOO HARD even the waiter prefaced use to break it up into pieces before eating and it was still not manageable. Definitely NOT worth the price because the garlic also came with all the Okonomiyaki. We got the flight which we chose chicken, pork, and shrimp. The 'pancake' vegetable mixture was kind of soggy and I could not really tell the difference between each of the toppings to it was the underwhelming. It was very salty and covered in sauce so everything tasted the same. Lastly the popular shaved ice and mochi donuts: we got the Yuzu Kakigori and chocolate mochi donut. The yuzu kakigori was sesame and yuzu flavored but to me that was such a obscured combination that did not set well and the donut did fit the description but it was just the same plain dount covered in different sauces.  Overall I would not come back, the dishes were really expensive and but I think there is room for improvement.",

The tofu one had really deliciously seasoned mushrooms and normally I don't like mushrooms but they're were amazing. I also liked the octopus one, it wasn't chewy at all which I wasn't expecting. The chicken one was pretty normal so if you're more adventurous then I suggest trying the other two. They also have chairs that serve as storage for your bags and clothes which I loved, especially in this cold weather when I have big winter jacket.  Definitely will go again to try out more of their menu.",

Treat yourself and get here soon, before this cozy spot is filled every night.....highly recommended!",

When I heard about Gaijin coming to the west loop I was really glad to hear it. Ramen and sushi are great but it's awesome to have something different and just as good and satisfying from that region here. I went the day after they opened and sat at the chef's bar. This gives you the chance to watch them construct what you ordered which is very similar to okonomiyaki shops in Japan. I tried the Hiroshima traditional okonomiyaki and it was great and similar to when I last had it in Hiroshima. I'll surely be back to try to the Osaka style and other offerings on the menu.  The staff was helpful and friendly. When I told the waiter that I previously had okonomiyaki in Japan he quickly gave me the menu and got out of the way which is nice. Some places feel the need to over explain things even if you're familiar with it. The place looks great inside with nice dark wood tables and chairs with red seat cushions that echo a modern contemporary Japanese setting. The chairs double as storage so don't forget your things if you use them! Overall, I'm glad Gaijin came along to shake up the admittedly delicious inundation of ramen shops in the west loop with a different but equally delicious Japanese food.",

I got the pork, octopus and the tofu (featuring tofu from Phoenix Bean Tofu). Despite my love for octopus the tofu was hands down my favorite. I can't stop thinking about the mushrooms in it. Soooo good. Don't pass it up!  Also, get yourself a highball, order some kakigori to share and for the love of all things good in this world do not leave without a mochi donut.",

The menu is broken down simply and the staff are extremely attentive and helpful - explaining any part or item that we didn\u2019t know. Chef Virant even gave me suggestions of where to go on an upcoming trip to Japan.  I went with the Osaka style Okonomiyaki flight - a selection of 3 (Shrimp, Beef, and Octopus).  My friends both went with the traditional Hiroshima style which has layered ingredients including yakisoba.  Can\u2019t wait to come back again and try more items.",
