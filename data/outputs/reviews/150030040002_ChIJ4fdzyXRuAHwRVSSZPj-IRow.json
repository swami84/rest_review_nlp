        "caption": "I come here often for their bento and spicy ahi combo. I used to eat the udon salad which is also great, but I\u2019ve been sticking to the other items which have a bit more protein in them.  The bento here is great and provides a lot of various flavors in them. My favorite is the grilled chicken because it\u2019s spicy and not fried. The grilled chicken is a bit salty though at times. The karaage and katsu/tonkatsu is great too. The spicy ahi is creamy and delicious and the combo comes with a salad.  I miss the days when this shop actually used to serve sushi. But, I\u2019m still happy with the food that they serve.",
