Also had the \"baked\" crab stick salad which for one was just like a knife salad, pepper chicken was probably the only good thing we had along with the sweet potato fries and the red n white rolls were okay. Probably the only time we're going here again. Rice with braised pork was decent. Only ordered it for my daughter, so she'll have something to eat because she didnt like anything else. The waiter was rude when we told him nicely about our fries, at first he gave us just regular French fries and we ordered sweet potato fries, he even went back to his little book to check.

Felt like it was missing a bit of Kumquat flavor personally but it was fine. Also tried their Mango Milk with Boba. I think the flavor is great but the Mango their diced and added it felt sandy to the mouth because it was finely diced. Also personally think it's way too sugary. Their dessert is good the cheesecake I tried. But wait time was a bit long for a drink and a cake. But overall would recommend it. Just make sure to go with a sugar level lower. If you do normal usually, go for low sugar.",
