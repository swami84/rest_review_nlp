As if they might have had the soup in the freezer and removed it to be warmed and served. The dumplings were soggy, the other stuff in it was disgusting. I had to throw it out. How do serve the public food that was cooked days ago. The audacity. This was so disappointing. Shame on them. I have had friends who have had bad experiences as well. You cannot serve the public food that was prepared and stored in the freezer or refrigerator from days ago. Most of us know the difference when the food isn't fresh. Shame shame shame.",

A lot of it seems to be a management issue in their defense. They always run off things and seem overwhelmed by the number of customers. I like the food there but it makes the trip there a cringe-worthy proposition that I would rather avoid. As a final note -- if you are a fan do drop by you won't be disappointed by the food. Just bring a thick skin. All others look elsewhere for Jamaican food and don't let this location put you off.",

        "caption": "The food is fine. The food is not the problem at all. The customer service at this location is HORRIBLE. There is literally only one friendly employee working here (the manager is friendly as well). The workers at this Golden Crust are very easily annoyed and aren't afraid to show it. They laugh and talk amongst each other but give attitude to the customers. Today my order was mixed up with another customer's order simply because the man was too lazy to open my tray after he fixed it to make sure that it was actually my order. The cashiers do not pay attention and will go off and do other tasks while you're waiting to be rung up and they don't ever apologize or excuse themselves. Disgusting customer service. This location should hire a completely new staff and train them how to interact with and take care of their customers.",

Kept going off at the mouth I told her she have no customer service skills at all instead of arguing with me you should have said sorry and try to fix it and move on she told me she don't have to services me and walked off so the lady that was on cashier came over and apologized for the other girl and help me my Point of contacting y'all is because I'm not sure if y'all are aware of the ignorant employees you having working for you when a customer comes in you are suppose to Stop what you doing and greet the guest and instead of going back and fourth with a customer you say sorry and fix the problem not escalate the situation of my husband wasn't sick I would have NEVER spend my hard earn money in a place that have no respect for they customers",
