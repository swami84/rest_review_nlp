Ordered online for pickup and although I was notified my order was ready, I had to wait about 25 additional minutes for it, so the kinks remain. The store was full inside to its limited COVID capacity, so I had to wait outside with a few other patrons. However, in the end, it was worth it! My order was correct even down to my request for ranch dressing on the side (I honestly was afraid it would be incorrect), fresh, well presented, and delicious! This is the first time I've ever tried Charley's but it won't be the last! Until all of the kinks are worked out, however, I'll try to stay away from rush hours like the Friday evening I went. Photo: Chicken cheesesteak with everything and ultimate fries (with ranch dressing not shown on the side).",

The man and young woman on the grill were SUPER slow at getting subs out. The man looked confused as he was reading orders on the monitor and kept messing up the orders. The young girl had to keep throwing out perfectly good philly steak and chicken bc orders kept being messed up. The manager did absolutely nothing to help speed up and facilitate the process. All she did was stare at them, even after the young lady on the grill expressed her frustration about her grillmate who clearly was not making the job any easier. I was very upset about how long our food took, there were so many employees just standing around looking confused. This place needs to do better or I can\u2019t see it succeeding here at all. I so badly wanted to just get a refund and leave, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for all those employees who are clearly just under bad management and looked as though they needed more training.",
