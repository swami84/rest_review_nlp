Pani is our favourite place to have a \u201cmerienda\u201d in Buenos Aires and seeing that it was getting closer to our new home was exciting. But then we realized they were making their amazing \u201cpan dulce\u201d (panettone) for Christmas. We bring them to the table every year, so we know them and love them. But this year with the pandemic and my ongoing pregnancy we couldn\u2019t fly back home to be closer to our family. The idea of having this was the perfect way to feel a little bit closer home, we knew we needed to get one!  We live in New York, but the delivery service only reached the Miami area. However, on the other side of the line Agustina figured that something could be done, that Panteones are not like other products that need to be refrigerated to get to the destination in a good shape. Understanding where we were coming from, she captured how important this was for us, and after a lot of effort and time she figured out a way to ship us two of them. We got them quickly and in perfect shape!  It was incredible to feel a little bit closer to home in such difficult moments.  If you happen to be in Miami and can visit this store you need to try everything, but specially the cakes. The Chola, Chocotorta, My Fav and Kat Flora cake are our favourites.  We are really grateful with Agustina and all the people involved who made this posible. We are dreaming about having a Pani here in New York. Please, make our dreams true again! \ud83e\udd17",

My first impression was a bit confusing due to the decorations but after taking the time to review them, I can appreciate the hard work for the theme. Moving on to the food, we had a party of nine people so we decided to try many dishes. Let's start with the Tar- Tar - Tar - Tar which is a Tuna tartar this was incredible, I have never had anything like this before, great taste and flavor.   We also had the Slow-Loved Short Ribs I never seen ribs breakdown like those without any effort they were delicious. Next, we had the Once Upon A Salmon, we ordered two of those and when the plate came out they were identical, a lot of detail to the presentation never mind they were outstanding. We finished with the Pina Colada Mockcake that thing was out of this world. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant, can't go wrong with nothing, everything we ordered was on point with great service. I'll be back for breakfast next time! Great Job Guys! 10/10",
