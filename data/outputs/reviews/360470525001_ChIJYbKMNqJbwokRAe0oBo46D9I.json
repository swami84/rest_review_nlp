The good:  The online specials are unbelievably generous (there was a $20 deal going on that provided me with more than enough food for like 3 meals), the wing flavors are interesting, and the chicken is generally of good quality.  The Cajun and original hot wings flavors were especially good, and the lemon pepper was tasty as well. . The okay:  The fries are just fine -- nothing that special but nothing that objectionable either.  I didn't love the garlic parmesan flavor but I still was able to finish it -- I think it's probably because I'm not used to it as a combination of flavors, and I might warm up to it if I have it again.  The bad:  The service is insanely slow for a restaurant with so few people in it. I waited forever even after putting in an online order before I even arrived at the restaurant, and I showed up to pick up the online order about 15 minute after the time listed to pick-up to try to avoid waiting.  The service workers are friendly, but they are clearly massively understaffed and wait times this slow shouldn't happen.",
