The food was good but it could have been a touch more creative. The menu seems to have a very traditional feel that reads like a who\u2019s who of traditional Chinese dishes including some odd and exotic but authentic ones like deep-fried pigeon. Overall, I hope to go back here after the pandemic and when the weather warms up and try some more dishes/cuisine this restaurant has to offer. I also like that they provide you with hot tea if you wish (choice between water and tea but I get both) and a little tray of little finger foods like roasted peanuts and dry chow mein noodles that you can eat when you\u2019re not focused on your main meal..",

The chicken and broccoli was amazing. Perfect amount of spicy, delicious brown sauce, good quality chicken, and not greasy at all. The Mongolian beef was also very good with a delicious sauce and peppers and onions. The wonton soup was huge with like eight huge wontons with good meat inside. The broth was also tasty. I will definitely order from here again. Thank you!",

We stumbled upon this restaurant for a late night dinner that look a little busy and thought let\u2019s give it a shot...keeping our fingers crossed they would take us with no reservation. We were immediately seated and the restaurant could not have been cuter. It was so quaint and we didn\u2019t feel we were on top of other tables and guests. We order tea for the table...highly recommended. Great prices on beer and wine. And our dinner blew our minds...so flavorful and light. Not greasy in the least bit!! The wonton soup was amazing, beef skewers so tender and the seafood fried rice was just perfect. This was such a happy find for us walking the streets in Chicago. My only recommendation to the restaurant is maybe a little mood lighting...they were tad bright for 9 o\u2019clock at night. But if we lived here, we would dine here quite often!",

I prefer Grandee Cuisine around the corner on Grand and St Clair (which for some reason right now has a google glitch-- if you search Grandee it shows up as Ming Hin though these are very different resturants!) google, help Grandee fix this hack!!",
