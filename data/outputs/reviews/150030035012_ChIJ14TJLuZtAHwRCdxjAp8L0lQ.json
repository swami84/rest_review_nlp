This is bento shop and no eat inn. They also have $1 mochi donut and andagi. If it's close to my office and home, I'd come here more. They open 10 to 3 PM, so it's good for lunch.

ANDAGI: Is pretty sized right for the price at a $1 each its tempting not to just get one. The outside is crispy and the taste when biting in to it has the perfect balance of sweetness to it without feeling like your eating a sponge of oil.  SWEET POTATO MOCHI: Its a sticky chewy delicious treat! It's not too sweet and very bite-sized. Although I rather get more of the andagi than these mochi ones.  SHRIMP TEMPURA ROLL: My favorite roll out of the three I always leave hear getting more than one. Im a fan of shrimp tempura and this roll has the right ratio of rice to shrimp meat :P  DONBURI: Cant go wrong with the sukiyaki don! Its my favorite! Its fresh, has great rice to meat ratio and the egg just completes everything! Also the meat is so juicy and not overdone!  This may seem bias but for the bentos I always get the shrimp roll set, it has a little bit of everything and my favorite shrimp tempura. The various veggies and sides that come with it creates a perfect meal!  They sell various Japanese style vegetables as well, such as lotus root, gobo and carrots,  seaweed, squash, string beans, side rice, just the shrimp tempura. Its your ones stop shop for Japanese meals and desserts!  The real challenge is the parking. Never the less you can always park across the street where walgreens/petco or the salvation army donation drop off container is and cross the street.  Its all worth it for them hot, crispy and moist Andagi!!",
