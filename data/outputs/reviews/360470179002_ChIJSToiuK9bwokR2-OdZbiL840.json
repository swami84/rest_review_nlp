The pool table was not level and had some serious grooves in the felt, made the play at any skill level relatively impossible. I still enjoyed the game room for the big couches and the big buck hunter.  All the food I had was terrible and is why I rated so low. The Nachos were swimming in moisture from the meat causing them to be soggy (massive portion though). The pulled pork sliders tasted like they had been left in a crock pot forever. The Detroit style pizza (which I was super excited for since its hard to find in NYC) was also soggy, no crispy bottom and just flat on flavors. It seems the red peppers they used were from a jar with water and put under the cheese so they just drowned the crust in moisture. While I didn't try it the mac and cheese was described as OK, at $17 dollars with bacon I would hope so. The prices weren't bad but, since it was all mostly not edible it was not worth it.  They need to get a new cook/chef in here. If you're looking for a bar to just drink at, stop in for the friendly staff and big selection of drinks. Just don't order the food.\u200b",

They used some weird dried Butternut squash that was so tiny I couldn\u2019t see it let alone taste. Croutons not pumpernickel. Poutine tater tots were good but hardly any bacon & had some fried mozzarella sticks thrown in for good measure? IDK. Drinks were good but small.

Been here a few different times, and the result has always been similar: 1) Went before a concert at Barclay's Center, and the place, surprisingly, wasn't that crowded. Nevertheless, the place was understaffed on an event night and it took at least 10 minutes just to get a couple of beers despite the modest crowd and open spaces at the bar. 2) Went for drinks on a weeknight when there was no event accross the street. The place was pretty empty, but it still took forever to get served, and didn't receive the whole order when we did get served. Then got attitude from the bartender when we asked for the items they had forgotten. 3) Went on a crowded Saturday night. A decent crowd but still a good amount of open spots at the bar. Took way longer than it should have for a bartender to take notice. Then getting them to close the tab out later took forever as well, I almost just left my card there and ordered a new one.  The place should be really cool, but it's a super frustrating to go to currently.",

The food was phenomenal, the ambience was wonderful, the management was great in making sure that everything was good with our meal, but the waitstaff were most likely understaffed. After we finished our meal and had dessert, it took nearly 20 minutes just to get our check.  There are probably some kinks that need to be worked out with respect to the waitstaff. All other aspects of our meal were rather pleasant. This restaurant is still new and it's clear that they are actively making and effort to improve their efficiency. I cannot wait to try their food again in another month or two. I'm sure by then they will be even better!",

        "caption": "Wasn't bad but wasn't worth the money either. I arrived sat at the bar and after about 10mins finally got someone's attention.  Since it was my first time there I played it safe and got the signature burger and fries.  Food came within a reasonable amount of time and was hot. Sadly it was over seasoned. Very salty to taste. Drank 3 glasses of water with dinner even though I'd had a cocktail at my disposal. Staff was friendly (after noticing I was there) but once the food wasn't up to par with expectations it's a lost case.  I can even deal with subpar service if the food was good. Sorry I had high expectations for this spot",
