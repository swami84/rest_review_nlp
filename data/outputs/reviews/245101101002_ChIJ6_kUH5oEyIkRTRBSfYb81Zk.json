It took a ridiculous amount of time to first be served water, cleaning products were left at the table, we had to ask a number of times for a menu, we were never asked if we wanted anything other than water or if we wanted to order appetizers while we waited. We then waited a ridiculous amount of time to put our order in...to the point where we saw people who\u2019d come in at the same time as our third actually being served. When I finally got the waiters attention and tried to explain our aggravation his response was \u201cI already know how this is going to go and y\u2019all should just leave\u201d. We did just that! Never got his name but he knows who he is and he should NOT be in the service industry. PERIOD.",

Today I ordered a chicken cheesesteak as a wrap. It comes with fries. I usually LOVE the fries. Today I could not enjoy them. They were so full of pepper it was unbearable. The wrap was peppery too. I had to decide eat the wrap or the fries. I couldn't tolerate the pepper from both. I actually tried wiping the pepper off the fries just so could eat a few.  Also the time varies when ordering for pickup. Usually if they say 10-15 minutes that means 20-25. Today I was told 20 minutes and was thinking wow. I go over (just across the street from job) in 20 minutes and surprisingly my food was ready. I wondered how long it had been ready because the fries were almost cold.  I usually like this place and wish it could get 5 stars but the flavor of the same item is not consistent. The shrimp salad is the only thing that stays the same......watery and lacking of any shrimp to speak of. Ordered twice and learned my lesson.....never again.",

I ordered the crab and shrimp quesadilla. Once it came out,  I took a bite. It had NO seasoning at all. I tried to use the sour cream and pico it came with but that didn't help. I wanted to see what other kind of seasoning or sauce I could put on it. But no one came to check on me once my food came.
