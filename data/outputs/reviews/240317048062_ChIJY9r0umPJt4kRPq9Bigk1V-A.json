The spaghetti (I upcharged to get meatballs) was a large portion and so delicious. I was expecting basic, but the sauce and the garlic and basil just made the entire dish. The meatballs are totally worth the money. I will order from here again!",

So much so that whether my mom and I feel like celebrating or in need of a mood boost, THIS is where we go.  The energy is awesome.  You feel the love of a traditional, home-made experience, but with a garnish of elegance and a flare for gourmet excellence.  THE OWNERS AND FOUNDERS ARE STILL IN THE KITCHEN COOKING EACH MEAL,  to this day.  Most recently, we had LITERALLY the best meal we have had in a while.  Very Covid conscious, we felt well protected and very comfortable with the sanitization practices.  BUT THE FOOD....OH THE FOOD. So I think we ordered literally almost 2 items per section on the menu - yep it was our 2nd meal out since March so...  We started with the grilled pumpkin salad made my the lady  of the house: Incroyable! (French for incredible).  Then the most amazing pasta dish I have had in years I believe (since I visited Italy in 2008): THE PUMPKIN RAVIOLI.  I literally had everyone looking at me - I think my sounds of appreciation were a bit disturbing - ha! We both had the same entree: The red snapper fillet with sauteed veggies in a white wine and caper sauce -  magnificent and enough for 2 meals.  The wine was an incredible Italian made from organic grapes, this was after the negronis from the bar, the drink was perfect - I drank it way too fast. To show their appreciation for our visit, the kitchen sent us a dessert sample platter made fresh by the chef himself - I have to tell you at this point I was lost in some sort of food trance -  I just couldn't believe how delicious every SINGLE dish was.  Here we had a flan (yes, flan - but not sweet and sugary, the perfect balance of ingredients), and a freshly made almond cake.  WELL THEN.   This experience stayed with me for weeks on end.  This made up for all the COVID misery off not being able to enjoy a delectable meal once in a while.  THANK YOU!!!",

Really great service, I believe it was the owner or manager who came out to talk to us about the wine list. Speaking of which, they have a great selection of Italian wines at various price points. They have a large selection of pasta dishes, many of the pastas themselves are homemade. And lots of sauce options as well. We both enjoyed our meals (manicotti for my wife, tortellini for me). Will certainly be back to sample more of their menu.",

There was no host so we waited a few minutes to be seated (I should know by now to leave at this point, but the recommendation...) So we wait and the busser finally greets us and takes us to a table.  They advertise 50% wine by bottle on Wednesday with the little stipulation of under $50 a bottle, of course anything decent is above. The waitress was incredible pushy and demanding the entire time, I had to tell her three times we decided we didn't want wine.  Then I ask her about two dishes, and she says she'd recommend the $40 lobster special... Ok, I didn't even ask about that but no thanks. I'll need a minute to think about my meal. She comes back and again pushes the lobster (why I didn't leave now I don't know) So we order chicken parm and the crab capers and olive pasta dish.  First off every pasta dish has a surcharge of meat. The chicken parm wasn't breaded and it lacked any flavor, we ended up taking it home and throwing it away. The crab was dry and lacked flavor, of course the capers added flavor to the dish because they're capers.... But nothing about it was any better than a pasta mista dish at $9.99  So with a rude server and overpriced bland food I'd never recommend or come back here.",
