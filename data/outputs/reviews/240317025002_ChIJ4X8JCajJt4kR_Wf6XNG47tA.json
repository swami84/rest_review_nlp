I prefer malty beers, but order pilsners to gauge the brewer's skills. Their pilsners were clean and crisp, no off flavors. Their stout was solid and the variations upon it were well balanced to highlight the original and not overwhelm your palate. Even their gose impressed. Great bar food too.  We spent five nights in the area, visiting many breweries. Every style that we tried here was the best example on our trip. This is the only brewery that made us want to bring beer home to Asheville, NC. Start and end your DC beer tour here.",

Yeah their beer is great, yeah their employees are fantastic and truly care about their products and service but it truly is so much more than that. Right when the COVID 19 lockdown started Silver Branch was the ONLY place around I could find flour or yeast for quite some time and let's be real there's not a huge profit margin there. However, they did it because they had a resource they could provide to the community.  This place continues to adapt, to try new things, to be different, and not just with their beer. They collaborate with the local community, listen to feedback, and step their game up every day. You'll find they regularly host resident chefs for special themed food nights. Last year for the Holiday season they brought in some amazing local makers and vendors for a pop up holiday market. They regularly rotate out art in their taproom to showcase new artists. In their COVID response they expanded their outdoor seating, popped open the garage door out front for walk up take out, and even asked me if I wanted my credit card disinfected before returning it to me. The newer cocktails they've been experimenting with (available in takeout kits) are amazing. The Pink Guava Margarita over the summer was a personal favorite of mine.  But of course you're here for the beer right? I haven't forgotten, that's amazing too (obviously). Nearly every time they have a new release I'm there. Even when the food service industry struggles in the world that is 2020 Silver Branch still have had several releases this year that donated to some amazing causes. Their Black is Beautiful Black IPA was not only delicious but the proceeds benefited The Sentencing Project. Yeah this is a long review, but this place does a lot. TL;DR Silver Branch is amazing all around",

They have since opened their outdoor areas and ensured every Covid-19 precaution was being taken, especially during their Oktoberfest celebrations. They\u2019ve built a strong connection with the community from the get-go, anyone who walks through the door is an instant regular. Love this brewery, excited for what they brew up next!",

Seeing both of the owners, Christian and Brett work alongside the staff is an example of the care and love they put into their business.  If my friends have a bad day, it's Silver Branch. If we're celebrating a birthday, it's Silver Branch. If we want to show our visiting family and friends what Silver Spring has to offer, it's Silver Branch.  The beer is excellent and rotates regularly to match the season. The food offerings, although small (remember, the specialty is their beer!), always hit the spot and are delicious!  Thank you to the staff at Silver Branch for always being attentive, inclusive, and open for a great time!",

For their troubles, I purchased 4 six packs of beer (their choice) as well. I marveled at their interior and hope to frequent them later as shut down wanes. I've tried all four beers and was duly impressed. All of them were 'sweet' tasting without having a 'sugary' direction. My wife who typically abhors beers actually like 3 of the 4 (stout was never liked but she tolerated theirs). I like Guinness, shiner bock and so their Chronicale: Foreign Extra Stout I particularly liked. The other 3 had great floral/fruity flavors that I was amazed to find in these beers. Very smooth, and if you want more bubbles, pour into a glass. Straight out of the cans, it can taste almost flat (which oddly is my preference).  Scared Table:Abbey Single-amazing and i liked the honeyed notes. Glass Castle: Pilsener. I usually don't like Pilseners, but this one was tasty. Quantum shift: east coast IPA. not as 'hoppy' as i was expecting but that was in a good way as some IPAs are way too 'hoppy' for me. if you like more floral/fruity IPAs without so much face forward hop...this will be a new favorite of yours.  super nice people working there who smile and are friendly. support local businesses!!!",

Having a wine and cocktail menu, with the wine from grapes from the same region as the hops they use, was already a nice touch but personally I loved that they had so many options for beer pours! They serve 1/4 pint, half pint, and full of every beer they have which makes it so easy to do less than a full flight but still get to taste different beers. They've got at least one of every beer you'd want to try and their IPAs and stouts in particular were very good.  Between indoor and outdoor seating they easily seat over 100 people, and from the looks of it they allow you to bring your own food which I think is a must for breweries in this day and age, but since there's ample space it's an actually good spot for a party. They also have board games and cornhole so you'll want to stick around!",

There was a person dedicated to making popcorn for the whole venue. Not a very good use of that person's time, especially when the bar and tables needed tending. Something to rethink. Also, not enough beer menus at the bar and tables. This is after all a brewery. The bar was unattended (afternoon of 3/9). You had to yell at the waiters for attention because there were so busy serving the tables. It took about 10 min for everyone sitting at the bar to get somebody's attention. No complain about service once achieved. Finally, having a cocktail menu is nice but it takes so long for waiters to prepare them that it slows down the whole place. I felt that the place was understaffed for a busy time but I understand there is a learning curve. I plan to go back and I hope the feedback is useful.",

I have been consistently impressed with their beer after trying it at various festivals and events throughout the area for the last several months. I loved at the brewery also has homemade sodas as well as tea and coffee. The space is absolutely phenomenal and the owners and staff are incredibly welcoming.  I look forward to enjoying many beverages here!",

The selection of beers they have is just starting, most of it is in collaboration with other nearby brewers since their facilities weren't operating. You can tell by the number of taps that they expect to have quite a variety though!  One thing I love is that they are going to offer four cask conditioned ales, with the traditional pump since they're not artificially carbonated. It's a little less expensive to buy them vs the same beer carbonated since they want to move them. (Cask conditioned ales need to be sold quickly because they're exposed to air.)  Prices are reasonable compared to the other breweries nearby. The bar is relatively small but there are a lot of tables. Food selection is pretty lean (at least at the moment) but you've got Silver Spring in the area if you want good food. I'm a bit surprised they went with Men/Women restrooms rather than gender-neutral ones.",
