        "caption": "Finding a African american restaurant on the upper west side of NYC is like looking for a needle in a pin stack. I think this is literally the only one. I was passing through her for a client who swears by their food. He\u2019s a older white guy who if not for him I would have missed out on the best tasting banana pudding I\u2019ve had In memory. It\u2019s my favorite desert and theirs had some southern black magic mixed in it. I wish I had purchased two servings. Theirs some nice history around this establishment and I suggest you go there, look at the old photos lining the walls and enjoy some really delicious food. #southernfoodnyc #africanamericanrestaurantnyc #foodnyc #upperwestsidenyc #nyc #uws #bananapudding #kingofcoffeenyc #kingofmarijuananyc #sankofatafari  UPDATE!!! After my first review I was contacted by management to try the peach cobbler. It was yummy for my tummy.",

Spoonbread has this aura of hominess, like your just relaxing on the couch and eating instant ramen. It's as if you're sitting in your own little bubble and enjoying your own dishes of delicious food.  If you do go (I really hope you do) then make sure to get the Peach Cobbler; it's AMAZING. Really great with vanilla ice cream too.",

The yams and collard greens are what's going to bring me back. OMG!!!! They are delicious. So, i ordered the Miss Mamie Sampler and honey it was just enough to make me order a plate. It is worth the money. Try it!!! I then shared a combination entree of ribs and fried chicken.  As you can see in the picture, we ate all the meat. We were full to capacity!!!!! Only downfall was the cornbread and the card machine being down. If it would've been online l, then the tip would've been higher. But, i must say.....this place is definitely worth the try.",

The part I don't get: as one reviewer mentioned, with only one other two-top seated in the whole joint, how come homeboy propping up the bar can't greet folks, offer menus, get water nor anything else that would signal that the place isn't self-serve? His main responsibility seemed to stand by/near/around the bar, chat with the two people already there, talk a little bit of unoriginal politics and then sing along to the playlist.  The young lady who did eventually wait on us was incredibly sweet and efficient but it's just weird with a staff of two to have one person hanging out doing sweet f-a. Tip well and tip cash so Sir Hangabout doesn't try to lay any claims.",

Even with the understaffing, we took a shot and ordered, 2 Grits with Catfish and 1 Waffle and Fried Chicken, 1 side of Mac and Cheese.  The grits neither of us could continue to eat, it had a taste of tap water to me, how you ask, I asked myself the same thing, the fish wasn\u2019t that bad. My other friend liked the Chicken and Waffles.  The Mac I had was salty, my friend who substituted Mac and Cheese for her Grits, her Mac had Cheese thrown on top, and not fully melted.

We waited a good 10 minutes before we were given menus and another 10 before our orders were taken. We never received cornbread for the table until we asked for it. My husband ordered an appetizer that ended up not coming out! It was a good hour and a half wait before we got our food!! We were told that they were short staffed and the chef was taking orders and cooking the food. There was a lady there that was helping with order taking, but she was also very slow moving. We should\u2019ve been told that there would be an extended wait due to the fact that they were short staffed. I also feel since we waited so long we should\u2019ve been offered a complimentary drink or appetizer or something. As for the food, it was just ok! My husband\u2019s chicken was not cooked all the way through. The ribs were salty. The rice and peas were bland!  I was very disappointed to say the least, especially since my three kids were with me and they were super hungry! They also had the nerve to add a 20% gratuity to the bill!  I will not be returning here!",

I went there 12/30/16 to treat my aunt and family to a belated birthday dinner to her.  The food was mediocre at best.  My beef ribs were cooked to hard the rice and peas were kind of bland.  Then on top of it all went to pay my bill with my credit card and had the waiter come back to tell me that the machine was outdated and would have to wait a while before they could charge the meal on my card.  Obviously I  was not gonna sit there and wait so I payed cash. And I still tipped the waiter who was more concerned about other patrons(who were white,  us Hispanics) way more than she was about us.  If you want great service and even greater food go to Amy Ruth's everything about them are outstanding.  I will not eat at spoonbread again as I felt neglected and discriminated against..... And to think I used to tell my friends with praise for them and always tipped the staff generously everytime  I ate there....\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15",

The decor was and upkeep of the restaurant was poor at best. It appeared as if it hadn't been mopped in quite a while. My friend and I both had Salmon. I had calaloo greens and candied yams and my friend had the macaroni and cheese and another side I can't seem to recall at this time. My son had the stew chicken and collard greens. All dishes come with rice and peas. At 12:45 in the afternoon, our rice and peas was not fresh at all. Most of it was comprised of burnt, hard, reheated, and maybe reheated again rice grains that obviously was scraped from the bottom of the pot from a day or two before. Everything on our plates were loaded with sugar with the exception of the calaloo. If you are diabetic, you would certainly be on your way to a diabetic coma. If you are not diabetic, after a meal there, you certainly would be. The meal there was highly disappointing and to think they thought it was okay to serve food in that manner. Nothing on those plates were fresh. The salmon was frozen and certainly microwaved. It was rubbery and sweet. If I wanted left-overs I certainly would have better luck with a 1 week old meal from thanksgiving dinner. I would not recommend this place at all. I was highly disappointed.  The doggie bag (we did not ask for) went straight into the garbage bag at Central Park. Btw... the restroom... no bueno!",
