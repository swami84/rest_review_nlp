I have been to China (and had amazing Buddhist vegetarian) and all over the world, and this is easily in the top TWO Chinese vegetarian/vegan restaurants I\u2019ve ever been to.

There could be a full blown riot on M street, and you wouldn't know because you'd be having a quiet and cozy meal in this basement restaurant. I've been coming to this place for 15 years and nothing has changed. NOTHING. For 15 years there has always been the same hostess/waitress, and I'm pretty sure the music is just one song on repeat. It's the best. In a town that looks nothing like it did 15 years ago, this place keeps it real and hasn't tried to turn their food selection into some asian fusion tapas BS like every other top chef place in DC. If you don't like this kind of vibe, then go somewhere else.  I'm vegetarian and I love going to chinese places with fake meat options and this place has plenty. The food here won't blow your mind, but it's always been solid and I've never been let down. The price is right and you won't leave with an empt stomach.",

To begin with they have child seats at all. So you either have to hold your child while you try to eat yourself, or put your child in inappropriately & dangerously large adult seat.  We went there twice in November with our son. The first time we used a could of chairs from an unused table to corral our toddler - so that we could eat and have him not walking everywhere. This worked pretty well. The second time we went we tried this again. However this time the woman waitress told us that we could not use chairs from an adjoining table even though it was not being used.  We walked out at this point.  I called back and spoke with the man-chef (the owner?). The man refused to hear me out. He hung up on me quickly before I could finish a sentence or give a full response.  Discrimination against people with children. That is what is going on at this place. They don't want people with children to show up.  If you were ever a child yourself, or if you have had children, I suggest you avoid Harmony Cafe at all costs. There is only \"harmony\" at Harmony Cafe when you don't show up with your flesh & blood children. That's not real harmony, nor are such actions consistent which Buddhist philosophy.  No we were not letting our son run everywhere in the place. We were trying to avoid that & to corral him using a couple of chairs so that we ourselves could eat. The staff refused to allow this, and they hung up on us when we called to complain.  FYI a more laid back & friendly alternative is just across the river (TNR Cafe is Rosslyn). TNR by comparison has child seats, is more friendly, and it's similarly fairly quiet.",
