The xochitl steak bowl and xochitl fries were great. The steak bowl was a great value. The shrimp tacos were extremely underwhelming in flavor and overpriced at $15. The fries were more like very large potato wedges and it was a pleasant surprise. The booth we sat at was missing button covers on the seat and pulled my girlfriend\u2019s hair out, so be cautious if you have long hair. All in all I\u2019d eat here again, but would definitely skip the tacos.",

Interestingly, I feel like the carnitas and chicken used in multiple dishes is cooked separate from those dishes. This is a problem because the biggest problem with the food is lack of seasoning. Example, chicken enchiladas. What would normally be a rich luxurious dish is somewhat bland chicken topped with a tortilla and a smear of mole.  The tacos were the most successful part of the meal.  Unfortunately, we have a lot of good taco places in Tampa.  Value for money is the biggest problem I see.  What you're paying for this food does not stand up to the taste or execution.  The queso fundudo is a hunk of cheese heated atop some chorizo. after a couple of minutes it cools to be a lump of cheese. The guac and pico are great, the fresh fried chips are nice, the the chicken tostadidas tasted okay but needed more acid or salt. The carnitas entree was pretty basic and under-seasoned.  If you want to spend the same money and have an incredible meal, check out oak and ola, across the street, or Rocca a couple doors down.",

The tacos (Carnitas, Asada, Pork belly, Summer Squash and Chorizo) they were all very good, but my favorites were the Asada and Chorizo. As for drinks we had the red sangria and mango lime margarita both very good, not too sweet and not too overpowering that you felt you wouldnt make the drive home!
