They have a buffet, but if you like butter chicken, just order that. My wife and I got two servings of butter chicken (the sauce is so creamy), jasmine rice, mango chutney, and naan.

I was really impressed that she called. She sounded like she really cared about my dietary needs and wanted me to be a happy customer. Unfortunately, even though I asked that the driver call me and leave the food at the front desk, He did not call. I went down to the lobby at the expected time of arrival and ended up waiting over 30 minutes. I then went to the front desk and saw a brown paper bag and asked if it was for me and it in fact was. The person at the front desk told me that he asked the driver if he had called me and he said yes but he in fact did not. Not only had I wasted 30 minutes but my food was cold and did not taste good. The jasmine rice was small and mealy. The roti it was super dry and hard and difficult to tear or chew. The gobi Manchuria was overly sauced and cooked in a way that the cauliflower was unrecognizable. The texture more resembled that of super dried, leathery chicken. Needless to say, I would not order from them again.",

Let me try again, so I called this restaurant and tried to order CHANNA MASALA. I told person (like 60+) that Last time it was not tasty. I just said that .... oh man.. He started angrily on phone without listen further. And he did not give me time to finish my sentence even, he cut the phone... I was surprised. I don't know how they can run business without having good hospitality. Food - Poor-Fair Decor - Poor-Fair (I dont know about Decor. Because I did not visit restaurant personally. But as you have to select option that's why I selected this option.) Service- Worse...There has to be another category ..like \"DO NOT GO\" Date was 2/26/13 6:30PM.",

We went a ahead and ordered a bottle of wine for only $20 which was surprisingly good.  We than proceed to order some Meat and Vegetable Samosas.  Both offering were very good.  You get one per order but they are very large so we should have ordered just one to share for two people.  There were four of us and we ordered vindaloo, tiki masala, shahi paneer, and butter chicken as well as naan.  Everything was very well seasoned and tasted absolutely delicious.  They do cater to Americans and allow you to specify wether you want your curry mild, medium or hot.  at the end of my meal I had a chai tea which was a perfect ending to my meal! P.S.  By the time we left a couple of hours later (we lingered) the restautrant was full of other customers.  I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends and will return myself.",

This restaurant has cooking the closest to home cooking that I've seen anywhere (even compared to restaurants back home...). Really great taste. The ambiance adds to the authentic experience. Hehe, once you step inside, there is no indication that you are in the US anymore (except for Dr. Oz on the TV). Everything (even the ceiling tiles and tacky art on the walls) seems to transport you back to a dhaba/restaurant in Punjab. On the upside, the food also transports you to that very same dhaba in Punjab.  Very very good. Looking forward to eating good Indian food here many times to come.  Caveat: First visit. Only tried vegetarian Samosa and Eggplant. Do not know about the rest of the menu (yet...).",
