While I spent a little more for the lox bagel, the size of the bagel and fillings was generous, making up for the price - a worthwhile investment. Lines can be long in the mornings (especially weekends) but with a little patience you'll be well rewarded. Parking may be tricky at times but be sure to follow the signs to park past the rock gym or find parking in the main downtown area.",

You've got a handful of  other bagel options throughout Gainesville. If you want the BEST, the BIGGEST, the most FLAVORFUL, the most ORIGINAL NYC tasting, and the most options for your bagel, then you'll need to head on over to Luke's to experience what a real bagel taste like. For those of you that want to complain about having to wait \"longer\" in line than anywhere else, well, all I can say to that is go somewhere else.  This isn't fast food/drive thru, it's quality bagels done the right way.   Where else are you going to go and get original cream cheese flavors made in house, like pumpkin spice during Halloween or apple pie crust cream cheese, or cinnamon spice bagels.  Or that amazing Asiago Bacon bagel.  Come on, man!   Luke's has the best bagels in the county and proof of that is in how often they are sold out before 1pm closing time. Luke's staff works very hard at what they do and do their very best in providing the community with a top notch quality product at what is a very reasonable price, especially for a bagel sandwich.   Go price breakfast sandwiches elsewhere and you'll see that Luke's isn't off the mark.  Again, for those of you griping about the wait...get outta line and go elsewhere so I can get my bagel order faster :) As a New Yorker, Luke's has the best bagel, best cream cheese, and best hot sandwiches and I'd wait twice as long if necessary in order to sink my teeth into one of his bagels. Take a minute to meet Luke and his dad Mike and the rest of the staff.   These guys are the real deal.   Keep up the GREAT WORK, guys.",

I was so excited. Everyone was nice but sadly that is the only positive. I order two lox sandwiches, one on egg everything and the other on garlic, and another two bagels. The sandwich starts at close to $9PLUS The bagel plus the cream cheese...ok my bad for not seeing the fine print. I also ordered a coffee with cream, I was charged 15 cents extra for creamer? Umm ok. Well I'm hoping $35 in for this it should be good. I take a bite of the egg everything lox sandwich and WOW it's so mediocre I could've cried, day ruined. Bagel was dry, hard, flavorless despite the insane amount of everything seasoning and so chewy it hurt to chew(also untoasted despite me asking for toasted). The garlic bagel was slightly better, didn't feel like I was eating something forgotten in the back of the fridge for a week, but still no flavor and not a NY bagel at all, still super chewy/gummy and slightly dry. In the end I couldn't eat the extra bagels at all, and I picked the lox out of the sandwich to eat. Maybe this was a fluke due to them newly switching systems? Maybe I got a bunch of day old bagels? But I honestly doubt it, the flavor was intensely lacking and I just can't see these getting better. Intensely sad and disappointed and really wishing I hadn't blown money on this place. I'd give it one star if not for the nice server.",

It was raining and there still was a line (9:30 Sunday morning). I wanted a everything bagel they were out already. I did get a poppy and also a Asiago bagel. My wife had a raisin bagel with walnut maple cream cheese spread. The bagels were big crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle very light in the stomach. I will be back to try the others. Very happy.",
