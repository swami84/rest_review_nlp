I walked back and came back with a mask and saw couple of guys with sandwich without masks. I asked him why would he have different standard and policies .. this is completely unacceptable. The guy then started calling name and also said \"SHUTUP\" in front of other customers. I hope this person get fired and have his heart and mind checked. He was very rude .. no customer service skills and no regrets .. never ever going back.",
