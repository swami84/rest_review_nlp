Coming from hospitality it\u2019s sometimes annoying when guest walk in with food modifications or demands however I asked kindly if my daughter half of the meal we were splitting could be modified and Penny who served and cooked went above and beyond to not only modify our meal but split both the soup and entree for us. Penny made us feel at home, provided great service n I\u2019m glad to have shared this experience with her. As I told her I absolutely love mom n pops spots. We\u2019ll see you soon thanks again",

        "caption": "Oh boy! This was one of the most special breakfast experiences I have ever had.  We were fortunate to stop here. It was Christmas Eve at 9:30 am with nowhere to go because the Mexican restaurant we planned was closed. Here the place is cozy, the food is delicious, the owner is a wonderful person and the food is inexpensive.  This was special because the sweet lady was by herself, we were 9 people and she said it was not a problem, she called a man to help her and both served us fast and efficiently. The food was sooo good, all 9 people were so satisfied, she has \"a something\" I don't know what in his cooking that give a tasteful homemade flavor. Plus because of her incredible sense of humor we were laughing and joking and left the place so happy and satisfied. The most unbelievable thing was that (if my husband's uncle didn't lie to us) for the nine people there the check was 61 dollars, can you believe it? Note: make sure to have cash.  I want to empathized that I am Mexican, I moved 2 years ago and I have never ever liked the american breakfast style. Second I kinda don't like eggs, this time I give a try and I ordered a mushrooms omelette. I don't know, but I just loved it! It was just eggs and mushrooms, but was so tasteful!! And usually I can't stand eggs!  Please, just stop by and try it yourself, I was so skeptical at the beginning and ended up surprised.",
