It gets very busy and very loud, which is understandable, but the lack of service isn\u2019t. Today we only saw our waitress once and when my food was brought to our table (by someone who was not our waitress) they ran off quickly before I could tell them that my order was wrong. Not only was my food not what I ordered, but what was brought to me was cold and had clearly been sitting out for awhile. It was really disappointing, I will not be coming back.  **the only reason I\u2019m leaving more than 1 star is because the lattes are very good, those are worth getting",

Our waiter was attentive and very friendly. He also made great recommendations for what to try. Next time I\u2019ll probably get some carbs!

Ordered the crab cake benedict and instead got a fried hockey puck with hint O' crab. Tasted like oil and nearly nothing else. I don't think there was real crab in it; I'm fairly certain it was imitation crab.  Avocado was brown and stringy in places. Also the chandeliers are in desparate need of dusting. It's not really a great experience to see giant dust clumps hanging above where food is being served .",

They often have a wait, and they mean it. If they say it's 35 minutes, you won't be seated before that in my experience, even if the free table you're eventually seated at was ready 15 minutes prior.  The food is fine. The coffee is fine. I have never had a meal there that I would seek out, one that I would describe as excellent. That's not to say that anything is bad; perhaps average is a better descriptor.  The service is okay; I tend to feel like they're not where I want them to be. I find myself waiting a bit longer than I wanted to for a refill of coffee or water. They're very nice, offering coffee to go and pleasant when taking your order, but maybe a bit less attentive than I personally like.  Back to the food: it's okay. I've gotten omelettes and Benedict, and my girlfriend has gotten chicken and waffles and french toast. Everything I've had is about what I can make for myself, if perhaps a bit less suited to my own tastes. The potatoes are a bit too mushy, the toast only comes with butter, etc.  You probably won't have a bad experience, but they're a bit too pricey for what's on offer here. My omelette was $12ish. A dozen eggs costs them less than a dollar. Potatoes aren't more expensive. I'm not asking for market prices. If they were cooked to perfection, or the wait was shorter, or the wait staff was really on the ball, I'd feel better about that price.  If you're in the area, you'll have a nice time. I wouldn't go out of my way for them though.",

We had to wait for only about 25 minutes, and once you put your name in, you can see how many parties are before you in line. The menu offers a wide range of both breakfast and lunch items, so whichever you feel like is an option. I split the blueberry lemon pancakes and the chilaquiles with a friend. The pancakes were fluffy and flavorful with a delicious blueberry compote.",

I ordered the Porkbelly Benedict, it wasn't even close to being warm. Each English muffin had a scant piece of Porkbelly which seemed to have barely touched a grill to cook it. My friend had the chicken and waffles. There was no butter on the waffle and when requested, cold butter was bought out to be used. Even the syrup was cold or should I say it was ice cold. No one wants to use cold  butter and syrup on barely warm waffles. The chicken, though seasoned nicely was over cooked. Suffices to say, we ate some and took the rest home to be reheated until hot. I've heard too many stories to  trust the idea of sending my food back to the kitchen when it's not to my liking. Perhaps your experience will be better!",

The prices are reasonable, and I'd say the menu is a bit more extensive than average, with lots of breakfast and lunch offerings (for example, three different kinds of french toast). The french toast was good, although it could have been hotter when it arrived. The burger was pretty average, but fine. The lamb burger was good. The hot chocolate was pretty, with a dusting of something on top, and my friend enjoyed it. My latte was tasty, nothing super special, but no regrets. It was loud, but about averagely so for a brunch place. Parking is a pain in the neighborhood, so don't drive, or expect to park several blocks away or pay a bunch.",

Perhaps I would have had more luck with one of their sweet options (our group of 4 all went savory), but they didn't sell me on my first visit.",

Their pancake flights are awesome and I love the kanela chip pancakes. For brunch they're a little swamped depending on the time and how busy the are. With a friendly staff and great food it's a nice start to the day!",
