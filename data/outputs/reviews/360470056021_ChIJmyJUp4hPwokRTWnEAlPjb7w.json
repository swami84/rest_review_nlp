We ordered the Russian bread appetizer, warm, and flavorful. For mains we had the risotto and and roast chicken. The roast chicken skin was especially lovely with the perfect skin crust that was like meat candy. \ud83d\ude0b. We wrapped things up the chocolate caramel tart and the beet and carrot cake, both also very good. They also had a live musician which was better than many live performance I've been to in the past, made for a great ambiance.",

The stuffed cabbage is good, as is the pepper rigatoni and most other menu items. The chef is very warm and friendly, with lots of experience in the kitchen. You must try their sorbet/ice cream combo of lavender and berry. It tastes so fresh, and is served in such a pretty way. One amenity that they don't really have is a bathroom. But if you really need it, you can request to walk through the kitchen to the tiny bathroom that's not easily accessible. Don't miss out on this place! Some of the best food in the area.",

Service is outstanding. I've eaten both inside the restaurant and during the Covid times in the cute little \"green house\" that sits out front. The inside of the restaurant is very warm and inviting. The green house seats 4 people and is surprisingly warm (no coat required). The beet and carrot hummus is amazing and that is coming from someone who is not a fan of hummus. The veggie burger is the best I've had so far. The pumpkin Mac and cheese is delicious. You have to try the lavender and berry ice cream/ sorbet combo. It's like eating a lavender flower over ice. Amazing and definitely perfect for when you think you're too full for dessert but still want to try something. Such a lovely experience eating here! Coming back for brunch with the girls soon!",

The facade is unassuming but the food can rival any high end NYC restaurant. This place is an absolute gem that needs more recognition! We enjoyed comfortable outdoor dining under heat lamps.

Our entrees were Wild Boar Papardelle, Veal Cheeks and Beef Stroganoff and one side Duck Sausage. These were very good as well. The only caveat was that we brought 2 bottles of wine \u2013 didn\u2019t mind the corkage fee $10 however, since we were such a small party and ordered Espresso we felt the corkage fee for the dessert wine at the end should not have been charged.

        "caption": "Fellow Foodies, we need to save this one-man kitchen in the hinterland of Bay Ridge, at 3rd Ave and 99th Street.  Beet & Carrot's professionally trained Russian chef confects his Euro-Russo, haute-provincial plates from farm to table, using dairy sourced from the Amish and meats from a family farm upstate.  What you get at Beets & Carrots is not chi-chi frou-frou, but gourmet reality, at way below Manhattan market price.  How about veal cheeks braised in red wine on polenta?  Or mini turnips stuffed with mushrooms?  And the description of beets on pumpkin puree for an amuse-bouche, or salad of roasted root vegetables for a contorno, cannot do justice to the soulfulness of judgment and taste in this chef's confection of his plates.  Each is its own world.  The chef  is doing this all on his own, in a closet of a kitchen, without so much as the help of a dishwasher, never mind a sous-chef, as his wife runs the airy, bright, kitcheny dining space.  That means a long wait for the food, but a wait well worth it.  Problem is, this is not quite the neighborhood for this chef's gustatory artistry.  A year ago, the menu had 3 dozen offbeat offerings.  The current one-page menu looks diner.  The Park Slope friend I convinced to come out to Bay Ridge eyed both it and me with uncensored censoriousness.  So we set the menu aside and went for the blackboard specials, making a special request for small tasting plates.  Feast your eyes on the pics attached, as we did on the food.  And the chef overruled our declining dessert, insisting on a complimentary taste of his pumpkin bread made with pignoli and olive oil, topped with a beet sorbet.  Moaning good.  Now, no offense, but how many Bay Ridgers are going to go for veal cheeks?  Not enough, I'm afraid.  This is not food for the squeamish, the snobbish, or the plebs.  This is food for the skinny glutton, the gourmet adventurer, the traveling foodie. I promise you, it will be worth the trip.  Take the R train to the 95th Street station on 4th Ave, and walk up to 99th St and over to 3rd.  There is a wine shop on the corner of 99th and 3rd where you can pick up a bottle, since Beets and Carrots is BYOB, not having space enough for a regulation size bathroom to qualify for a liquor license.  But are you going to complain about BYOB?  In my opinion, this chef is too personally inventive to be limited by a menu. I think he should offer only chef's choice everyday, making the best of his personally picked ingredients and culinary inventiveness.  Set up a big black board on the sidewalk with the day's offerings a la carte, and a pris fixe for four small plates.  Big problem with my idea is, not much foot traffic that far up 3rd Ave.  He needs a following, so you fools for food need to trek out to the Shore Rd boundary of Bay Ridge.  Come, pioneering palates, for pioneering plates under the Verrazano.  If it's a nice day, you can saunter down 3rd avenue to 95th Street, to Paneantico, where you can pick up the very best in Old world artisanal brick oven bread, or almond biscotti, or sundries of classic Italian bakery and deli .",

They buy their food from local farmers so the menu changes all the time - depending upon what's in season.  The Chef is from Europe and he's a genius.  Homemade pasta, baby squid with arugula, polenta, gnocchi, spaghetti with wild boar sauce, banana sorbet....  Everything is excellent! It's a culinary experience!   So why not 5 stars?  The atmosphere... or should I say the lack of atmosphere.  This venue was originally a deli and it still kind of has that feel to it...  Also, to get to the bathroom you need to walk through the kitchen. And no liquor license.. All this turns some people off... but I couldn't care less.  The food is THAT good.  The staff is also extremely accommodating and friendly.... it feels more like you're visiting friends than out to eat in a restaurant.  Until the check comes, of course. It's mid-range but \"looks\" like it should be cheaper... until you lift your fork!  So, if you appreciate amazing food and friendly but not fancy atmosphere, try Beets and Carrots.... you won't be sorry.",

Williamsburg and Park Slope have taken over the food scene in Brooklyn and I could absolutely picture Beets & Carrots  in those parts of our fine boro, but boy am I glad that chef-owner and his wife chose to open their business here!!!  We started our late lunch/early dinner with complimentary house-made basil and lime lemonade, followed by a vegetable starter from the chef. From there, we enjoyed a course of pasta - rigatoni with tomatoes and mozzarella, as well as their signature baby beets & carros cappelletti and rainbow radish, soups (chilled corn and warm tomato), a lovely and rather massive burger, crispy chicken with mushrooms and buckwheat, and finally finished with some banana frozen yogurt and banana and raisin ice-cream. The family-friendly atmosphere made for a very enjoyable and relaxing meal, with our two kids enjoying not only the food but also the company of other patrons' and the owners' children as well.  The clientele skewed younger than many Bay Ridge restaurants, hopefully signaling the changing demographics in our area and a wave towards more eateries like Carrots & Beets to come.  Wishing this wonderful new business much success and we look forward to being back here regularly.",
