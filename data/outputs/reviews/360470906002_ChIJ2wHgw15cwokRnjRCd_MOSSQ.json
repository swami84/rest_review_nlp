One of my employees suggested the place so I called and was greeted with a rude lady who seemed more concerned speaking to someone else in her language then helping me. After 2minutes she finally got the address down. When I asked how much delivery was she said $10 for delivery! So I said never mind thank you. She then told me never to call again. My employee said it must have been a bad day but she personally knows the lady cause she goes all the time so she offered to go to the store and pick up for us all. She called herself and ask to order for pick up instead sincewere on putting and it's only a few blocks away.  ($10 for a few blocks smh) but when she called, the lady got rude with her too and told her it's a $5 charge for call-in order and pick-up! AndAwhen mymemployee questionedqher about thesetnew prices the lady just kept talking to someone else and got rude with my employee again. As  a store manager this is horrible customer service. I camecon here rotsee there reviews and I see alot of good reviews  about food but more reviews of how rude they are. And if people can't even order from you how do you expect your business to flourish? Needless to say we will never order from here and oh and I almost forgot... When my employee asked her about the extra fees the lady told my employee to stop being fat and lazy and come walk to pick up her food... Like wow she's not even supposed to do that on company time. From one business owner to another get your customer service skills up please!  P.S. No.1 Chinese restaurant is delicious! Very sweet people. Fast delivery. Price is great! Go there instead!",
