It\u2019s just as described: tons of high-quality flavorful cheese, pillowy dough, and a deliciously crispy border and crust. My wife likened it to focaccia bread. We got the sauce on the side and used it for dipping \u2013 lots of flavor in that sauce, too! We were a little skeptical about the size, but these pizzas are SUBSTANTIAL. Big punch. Highly recommended. One more reason to love Chef Tony's. :)",

The food was fabulous, and, while it took a bit longer than was our previous experience at the establishment, it was prepared and served with care. My grilled caesar salad and chicken piccata tasted just as lovingly prepared as they had previously, and my date's cream of crab soup and parmesan crusted cod were delectable. The chocolate sin cake to finish it off was maybe the best part, but it is hard to say when everything was so tasty. We will definitely return, and look forward to being made to feel so welcome again.",

The other guests held the door open for the cold to come in and we were forced to wear our coats at the table in order to stay warm. We asked to be moved to a different table immediately after arriving. We were told there are no more tables available in the back. After a quick walk to the restroom, there were plenty of open tables. If the justification for the open tables is COVID, it\u2019s obviously much better to have a crowd of people around our table waiting hours for their to go food. The dine in experience was miserable and judging on what it\u2019s like to take away, this is the first and last time we\u2019ll eat here.  Also, the host at the front door is a cranky old man who was rude to everyone he spoke with.",

Not wanting to go to downtown DC, Chef Tony';s was a convenient location with a parking garage across the street. We did schedule this dinner several weeks in advance, and finalized the menu and pairings beforehand (They provided a menu tailored just for us). We were seated promptly, and the service was exceptional, as well as the food! (see pictures).  We had plenty of time, and were not rushed at all. The servers explained each food and wine selection in detail.  Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. We met Chef Tony and his wife afterward, and they were charming and appreciative of our patronage. Well done, Chef Tony and Staff!  UPDATE, June 2020 We ordered takeout from Chef Tony's for a 60th Birthday party for 12 People.  I volunteered to pick up dinner, and pulled up to chef Tony's, where the spot outside the restaurant was reserved for pickup orders.  I was pleased to note that the young man working outside had a mask and gloves, in addition to the chef's apron!  (I am keenly aware of Properly worn PPE and respect when people in the food service industry \"get it right\").  He pulled the order quickly, and  placed it in the car for me without incident.  Everything was hot and ready when I arrived at the party 10 minutes later!  All the food was delicious, and there were ample napkins and plastic silverware.  I was very impressed, and pleased at the extra steps taken in preparation.  I also learned that chef Tony's has been \"deep cleaned\" for cleanliness as well.  normally we would have gone to the restaurant,  but our outdoor \"social distancing party\" was a success!  Kudos to Chef Tony and his staff for doing a great job!",

So we met at Tony's. Our service was excellent and everything was so tastefully prepared. I brought home half of my meal and the left-overs I ate were just as delightful as the night before. I will definitely come again. The atmosphere was perfect for us to talk and catch up on things. It was a perfect night for me. thanks, Chef Tony.",

You will be seated in a very narrow corridor like a jail. My friend and I sat in front of the door that goes to the kitchen and had to endure the noise of dishes all over the place. My right arm was brushing the wall so my purse had to be on the chair near the corridor. It was dropped 3 times by the waiter that had very tight space to walk. I had no choice other than put my purse on the floor under the little table that could barely hold our plates. I ordered jumbo scallops and got seafood paella. Not my favorite but I accepted it otherwise I would had to endure a lot mire time at the torture corridor. The price was really high, not worth what we got. The service was really bad too.  Bottom line: I will never go back, unless I go with a large group and be seated in a good place.  Sent from my iPhone",

I ordered the surf and turf, my husband ordered the braised cod. Let me just say that the worst things on our plates were the potatoes, and those were good too! Jumbo scallops were perfectly done, and the shrimp, fillet, and cod followed suit. The tiramisu was different from any I've had, but I enjoyed it because there was a higher ratio of Lady fingers to cream than normal. Paired with an Americano coffee, the dessert ended a fantastic experience. The server, who coincidentally was also named Anthony, was polite and timely.

There really isnt any place to wait either if you decide to stay. Again not a big deal for me. So I waited and then I noticed two tables get sat before me which is a problem. It's not like they were waiting because they weren't. I decided to leave which is to bad because I'm from out of town and doubtful that I would visit the area again.

We also enjoy the appetizers which are varied, nicely presented and great for sharing. Be sure to leave room for dessert. There is a great selection and they are made in house. Very fresh, tasty and generous enough to share. And what is really nice is that Chef Tony is really in the kitchen cooking and overseeing preparation...and often comes out to schmooze with diners. Good food, well prepared,  friendly staff and an unpretentious neighborhood vibe ....oh, and reasonable prices (especially with Groupon offers). That's a combination hard to find. Don't miss it.",

The seafood is fresh & the preparations are delicately prepared to bring  out all the wonderful flavors.  Jumbo scallops were juicy and perfectly seared, and served if delicious garlic mashed potato.  The jumbo shrimp and penne preparation in a very light sauce was (essentially) an explosion of flavor for our pallettes to experience. The portions were quite generous indeed.  There's a full bar, with a good selection of wines available,as well. The dessert choices are many, we selected the creme brulee`, which was perfectly caramalized!!  This small restaurant has a cozy romantic feel, with soft mood lighting and simple  ambience. The location, in the heart of, Bethesda is great too. There's free parking in a small covered parking lot, exactly opposite the rest..  We had the pleasure of meeting Chef Tony in person. Long story short, I strongly recommend this restaurant, and is now added to the list if my favourites.",

That said, it's not the most stunning seafood place I've been to, and is probably a little bit overrated. The crab bisque was excellent but a touch on the salty side. Most of the other dishes were also very good but had minor nagging issues that kept the restaurant from a five-star feel.  Very friendly wait staff. Good family feel to the restaurant.",

Took advantage of the online ordering and curbside pickup at Chef Tony's (they deliver but I wanted to get out of the house). I arrived home and unpacked a huge organic salmon salad with enough for two meals which was amazing... and my favorite dessert, Chef Sonia's vanilla cheesecake with Walnut crust and amazing strawberries with sauce, enough for two servings ... but I ended up devouring all of it. I feel human again. I believe they create everything with some sort of peace and positive energy ingredient. Thank you Chef Tony and Chef Sonia!",

My wife and I both had the three course prix fixe this time based on a special he runs privately with his email group.  I started with the braised portabella mushrooms with red wine, reduced balsamic vinegar, and greens.  It was one of thoes appetizers that was so good, you wouldn't mind ordering a larger version as a meal. Delicious. The mushrooms were sliced and tossed with the greens, soaking in the delicious wine and balsamic dressing with fresh garlic and herbs. The portabella mushrooms were tender and flavorful,  not too soft and not rubbery - perfectly prepared.  My wife had the roasted carrot soup,  which was deceivingly comforting and sweet. Reminiscent of pumpkin soup, but fluffier.  The first time the waiter suggested it she was apprehensive,  but once she tried it, she never looked back and it has now become her destination go-to starter.  She then had the shredded crab and spiral pasta, which she tells me was delicious,  but the soup filled her up and she brought most of it home, so I'm sure I'll be having that for lunch tomorrow.   And I has the chicken marsala, which came with linguini and more of thoes succulent mushrooms.  The crushed tomatoe sauce was very well seasoned and of perfect consistency, but the chicken could have used a touch more salt and about 1 minute less time  in the pan, but when paired with the pasta and sauce, it made a great and flavorful bite.  We were seated in a little cove in the restaurant called Lover's Lane, which was perfect because it kept the usual restaurant chatter noise down and was lit up very nicely with string lights on the walls and nicely painted murals.  Finally, I splurged and couldn't stop eating the warm banana, cranberry, and apple bread pudding with warm vanilla Jack Daniels sauce, topped with vanilla ice cream. Trust me, it was EXACTLY as good as it sounds.  Again, always a treat.",

        "caption": "I have visited Chef Tony's a few times over the past year. It is a small restaurant with big dreams and the food reflects a drive for notice within the Bethesda area.  /Food/ Appetizer: Of the appetizers I have tried over the course of my visits [some being sampled from my SO's plate](Tapas sampler, mussels, calamari, crispy zucchini, ceviche, carrot soup, and a crap soup), I enjoyed the mussels and crab soup the most. The mussels were fresh and served in a delicious warm broth with bread and the crap soup had lumps of crab in a creamy base. I wish I had a spoon for the mussel broth!  Entree: As a seafood restaurant, the 3-course prix-fixe doesn't have any steak or red-meat listings but boasts salmon dishes, cod, monkfish, chicken dishes, and a few others I cannot recall. My personal favorite entree is the Scottish Salmon served with plantains and a cucumber salad, served medium-rare.  The comment about \"big dreams\" applies to the entree dishes I have sampled mainly because of lack of consistency, i.e. they are still experimenting with the dishes? The fish is fresh and perfectly cooked, however, the portions and servings have varied across my visits. E.g.: one time I had 4 plantains piled on the plate w/ my salmon order and then next there were 3 artfully arranged plantains, propped up for display; the cucumber salad on the side versus under the fish, etc. Consistently delicious, just variability in plating/serving makes me think there is still some experimentation with how the restaurant wants to present itself (and their food).  Dessert: About half of the desserts on the menu are made by Chef Tony's wife. The ones I have sampled pick directly from the house-made desserts which include cheesecake w/walnut crust, creme brulee, and tiramisu. Cheesecake: very, very rich. My significant other confided that they dream about the cheesecake at Chef Tony's because of the walnut crust. I was pleasantly surprised about how nutty and delicious the crust was with the chunky walnuts adding a nice texture to the thick cheesecake, however, I find the cheesecake very heavy and dense and the crust can be hard to cut through at times. Delicious, but again, consistency across visits has some crusts thicker than others. Served w/ strawberries, blackberries, and a sprig of mint on the side that helped constrast the creamy cheesecake. Creme brulee: perfect. served w/ strawberries, beautifully bruleed and flecks of vanilla bean throughout. Tirimisu: fluffy and creamy with a generous amount of cocoa powder dusting the top. Definitely something to split.  /Atmosphere/ The servers and Chef Tony have a family-like camaraderie that makes dining pleasant as all the servers are friendly and willing to help each other. The dining room is an odd shape with an alley like stretch of two-person tables walled up to the right of the entrance, a small area of tables upon walking in, and another dining room towards the back near the kitchen door. The two main dining areas are connected by a stretch that passes the semi-open kitchen/bar area. Chef Tony can been seen through the semi-open kitchen and often greets guests as they walk through. The decor is an odd mashup of Spanish-inspired and homey-chatskis that make the dining room causal and unpretentious. Also separating the dining spaces is a transition from wood in the entry-way dining area and tile in the back area. I would love to see a layout overhaul of the dining room area to unify and update the interior but the home-y-ness adds to it's charm.  /Price/ Reasonable for the Bethesda area (~$17-$25 for dinner entree, $35 for 3 course prix-fixe) and so many promotions and loyalty programs in frequent rotation. Chef Tony sends out an email letter if you sign up w/ deal promotions.  Overall, I enjoy the whole experience at Chef Tony's more than the individual dissection of its parts. The fresh seafood is wonderful but the combination of relaxed atmosphere with the friendliness of the staff make it a nice evening spot in the bustle of downtown Bethesda i.e. 5 stars.",

For appetizer we got the calamari and mussels. Mussels were very well cooked and calamari was equally as tasty.  The entree round fell flat on its face. The sole was decent, but everything else on the plate was just mushed together. I had the monkfish, which was terribly overcooked and tasted nothing like it was supposed to. The veggies were soggy and the broth probably could have used a little less salt.  Then came the dessert round. I've never had anything more disgusting in my life. The tiramisu tasted like it had fell in the toilet. It was extremely soggy and there was barely any flavor. The sweet potato pie was done like a creme brulee, but it too was watery and did not appeal to my taste buds.  Needless to say I will not be coming here again. If you want to waste $50 of your own money feel free.",
