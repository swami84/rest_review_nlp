Highly recommend the coconut curry, and the falafel is next level amazing. Fair price especially for Hawaii. They use organic produce as well. Smoothies are really good too, I had the chronixx and was worth the price I\u2019d say. The only thing was the salad, some of the spinach was starting to go bad. Which is understandable, as it\u2019s hard to keep spinach fresh for very long. Next time I\u2019ll just get all brown rice \ud83c\udf31 Thanks! Hope I\u2019ll be back soon to try everything else.

The Bombay Spinach was bomb to say the least. The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaraunt was cute and had artwork and jewelry on display that was for sale. But the food, oh my gosh, the food, was soo good. The portions were just enough to fill you up, but not overly stuff you. I also tried the falafel which was moist and crumbly, the way it is supposed to be made! I really loved the flavors bursting from this plate. I will definitely go back to try more! Solid recommendation! Aloha!",
