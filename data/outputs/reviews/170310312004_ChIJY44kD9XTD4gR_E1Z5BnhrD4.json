        "caption": "I\u2019ve been coming here for years with my boyfriend and his family and have always loved the food. They recently renovated, and the inside looks great and I love the efficiency of going through the line to order now. However, last week we came to get banh mi, and when we got home, I noticed that all of our banh mi thit nuong had peanuts in it. I\u2019m not sure if the recipe has changed since the renovation but for years now, there weren\u2019t peanuts in this sandwich. My boyfriend happens to have a peanut allergy, but luckily, we noticed the peanuts before he ate any of the banh mi. Since this is the first time this has ever happened, I\u2019m sure it was an accident. But I hope that either the cooks at VN Tofu can be a little more careful in the future when preparing the sandwiches to avoid adding unwanted peanuts to people\u2019s food or if this is the new recipe, that management could advertise that there are going to be peanuts in the food for customers\u2019 safety.",

I love going to VN for the various snacks and banh mi! Over the years it's always been a great experience. The egg rolls are great and so are the spring rolls. I also love their desserts and I always leave with atleast 3-5 packages of Nam. I've honestly never had a complaint until recently.  The past few times I've visited I've been very disappointed in the quality of the food. One of the desserts I had was definitely spoiled and had a dead fly on the outside bottom of the cup. The price for the nam I get went up ridiculously and the fried bananas were more oil than banana. But the most upsetting thing for me is the banh mi. I always get the combination and lately it's been awful. Little to no meat, super dry and the bread is chewy. I've also had a bad experience with one employee where she was extremely rude to my fiance and ignored him as he tried to speak to her.  I love the convenience of the store I just wish the quality would improve. I'll be back but much less than usual unless I see some improvements.",

Another time my banana fruit cake was reeked with the roten food swell, regardless I took a byte and it tasted like more like pudding then cake consistency.  I got so disappointed so I came back to tell them about the food quality, in hope that they will improve it.  When I got there, I saw an employer removing expiration date labels from the displayed food packages and replacing the labels with new dates.... Yikes....  Who does the owner think the customers are...pigs?   Please do not shop here unless u can see the food came out directly from their ovens/stoves.",
