        "caption": "I discovered this cafe in a strange way; it's owner was promoting it in a local Facebook group that I came across by accident.  I was curious about it since I love good coffee and I also like to support local mom and pop businesses.  I soon brought my daughter with me there to have coffee together.  The place was at first hard to find since it was on a side street off of the main avenue.  When I entered, it appeared about half the size of a typical cafe.  However, the small space was designed in such a way to give maximum impact.  The high ceiling exposing the natural wood rafters, an original brick wall, and another wall fully stocked from top to bottom with coffee products made this place visually appealing considering the small space.  Their coffee comes from the Brooklyn Roasting Company which I like since it's a local business that they  support.  I tried their vegan sweet potato coconut curry soup.  It was so good and had a little bit of a spicy kick to it.  The cheddar chive biscuit was out of this world.  It was savory and flaky with an unique cheesy-spicy flavor combination.  After my daughter sampled my biscuit, she wanted one for herself.  There are a few other food items on their menu including ham & cheese croissants, garlic cheese waffles, various muffins, and large cookies.  Seating here is limited.  Besides a full table with seating for 5-6, there are a few wall-mounted tables for those who don't mind standing.  Each of these tables has it's own dedicated outlet with USB connections for your electronic devices.  The husband and wife owners were here when we visited.  They were both warm and friendly and appreciated my business.  In a neighborhood that's saturated with cafes, this place stands out from the crowd.",
