A gem of a restaurant. We also got outdoor seating on the second floor!",

She was loud and didnt think twice about yelling at another server. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! There's no type of uniform so you don't know who is and is not a server, my waitress had a black SEE THREW shirt with roses on it , along with baggy pants, her hair was down so hair could have easily gotten into my food. I went looking around and there is 4 different sections you can sit at, the upstairs looks unfinished.  Every bath rooms trash cans was full . Some didnt evn have toliet paper,soap, trash cans,trash bags and paper towls. toilets look even more nasty then last time I came. The my boyfriend said the Philly was amazing and I tried some of smoked Mac&cheese and I was blown away by the flavor, But it seemed to be covered in chunks and grease , it was chunky and i couldnt eat anymorw or i woukd get sick. there was no healthy options besides a salad. I saw 2 employees smoking upstairs on the deck/balcony (my waitress and the owner). The food is great but the experience was awful. If your going yo run a restaurant at least do it right. Other that that I wish you the best and hole you guys get better at your job.",

That's it...the whole first floor of restaurant consisted of one small dining room and four very close tables! Two were rectangle folding tables and two were built out of 2x4's and they all had benches made of 2x4's with black tablecloths. You can see straight through a makeshift \"wall\" built with 2x4's straight into the kitchen. There is a TINY bar that could seat about six. At one point I had to use the restroom and I literally had to push a barstool away from the wall to get to the restroom. (Which means if someone was sitting at the bar I could not have reached the restroom.) When I switched on the lights for the restroom it sounded like it threw a breaker and I had to use the restroom in pitch darkness. The food was just alright. I had my son and husband both try mine and both said they didn't know how I had eaten any of it because it didn't taste good. The average price per person for lunch was $15 for a sandwich and drink. This was the strangest dining experience I've ever had...it made us all in my party very uncomfortable. I would not recommend.",
