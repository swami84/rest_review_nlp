Overall, such a wonderful experience. Our waitress was extremely kind and helped us through the menu. Best thing we did is pick one dish out of each option. Just to make sure that we get to try everything. Must get dessert after! Sadly it was too good i even forgot to take a picture of it. Dont listen to other reviews saying bad service.

The service was excellent, as well. I don\u2019t understand some of the recent reviews complaining about poor service. All of the staff we interacted with were helpful and professional.

And, for most of the meal it sure did, but some a few odd situations and one no no. All of the staff was attentive and welcoming. A bit discombobulated as we were asked by two or three different servers what type of water we wanted and then again taking our order. A bit odd, but it\u2019s better than being ignored. The food was pretty fantastic. The fish was extremely fresh and many a flavor explosion all over your mouth. The one major concern was that there was a small stone, presumably from the kelp in the ceviche, which I bit down on quite hard and while it is yet to be determined there appears no damage. But time will tell if there was a small fracture. I took this to the attention of two servers, and while both seemed surprised, there was not an utterance after. No apology or nothing of the sort. Which I found to be quite odd at an establishment of this caliber. One other caveat, is that they do include 20% gratuity automatically. Guessing there some cheap skates in Miami?  I don\u2019t always look at the bill and there is no mention, so I\u2019m glad I did in this case. Ranting aside, the food makes it worth the visit",

Both on and off the social media realm, I think its honest to say you've gotta try the food before you read any reviews. There seems to be a lot of bots and trolls hating on this business as of lately, my suggestion to the Changs: Disregard Trolls, Acquire Currency. Keep on shining yall, there is a reason why there is always a line at your counter. Best Regards, Andrea \"fuji\".",

The owner\u2019s son (Nando) needs to learn the basics of customer service in the food industry: Good interpersonal, communication skills, Problem-solving skills, and friendly service. None of these exist.... We went there on Saturday morning, ordered couple of rolls and were told it's going to take about 10 minutes. After 25 minutes I noticed a couple of customers that came after us and ordered have gotten their food. I approach the counter and said \u201cexcuse me, it's been over 20 minutes and we haven't got our food\". Suddenly the manager got Agitated and started Yelling! \"Do you want me to CANCEL your order!!\".... I didn't believe what I heard but he kept going on and yelling at me and asking if I want a refund!? \u2026.No, I just to know when I will be getting my food... So apparently he was insulted of me asking where my food was? I took a video of him yelling but couldn't post it here on Google (I snapped a picture of his angry face), but I will be posting this review with the video on other platforms. Doesn't matter if your food is the best You get Zero because I'm not spending my money at a place that does not respect their customers. Finally, when customers  are unhappy and post a negative review, you don\u2019t keep attacking them. You apologize and try to rectify the situation and show other your customers that you value their business ....But Apparently you lack this basic food industry skill.",

I'm a huge foodie...I've hunted down BBQ shack joints in little Terre Haute, IN to Michelin star restaurants in Lyon, France. Without a doubt, this place, ITAMAE, was a true gem.  I was skeptical at first...4.8 stars and 50+ reviews, but my gut said to go. It's located on the second floor of the St. Roch Market...tucked in the back left corner. To me, it seemed pretty unassuming until I walked up and saw the picture frame...ladies and gents, we have a James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards Rising Star Chef of the Year.  With my interest further intrigued, I stood and looked at the menu...even though I had determined what I wanted before I arrived. I was talked into the Unicorn Bowl...very interesting combinations...the tart and refreshing sauce, seaweed salad with sesame and slight sweetness, and the Peruvian corn had this hint of star anise(?). It's was a winner...and the cucumber gave some bite to otherwise softer textures. Well balanced all around from flavor, to texture, to colors...beautifully plated too.  Still hungry (I don't fill up easily) I decided to order one the originals that intended on ordering...the Pulpo Al Olivo; hamachi, avocado, olive oil, octopus, bojita olive aioli, and sarza criolla. An intense olive/briny burst from the olive aioli, then the lemon/acid hits, then a hint of cilantro, then you taste the nori, and finally a little heat at the end. So much flavor in small bites...perfectly balanced so that you'll finish the entire thing.  I'm only here for three days, and I think it'll be mandatory to come back every day. The seafood was super fresh and firm in every dish. Get there early while it's still quiet...your taste buds will thank you as you'll be able to focus on the nuances of each dish. Everyone behind the counter was very kind and helpful. I can see why they hang the award proudly on their wall. I hope they continue to shine.",
