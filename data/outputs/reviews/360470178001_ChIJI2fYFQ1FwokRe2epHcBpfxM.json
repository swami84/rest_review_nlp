I love Vietnamese food and this is my favorite place hands down. I ordered the pho bo em and mien ga, spring rolls, aloe its me, avocado, mango + passion smoothie. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS PERIOD!!! I will absolutely order again in the future. Also, the woman who delivered my food is so sweet I wish I asked her for her name she made my day and I'm glad she made it safe driving in this rain <3 Thank you so much! Please support this business they are wonderful!",

Beyond happy to finally find a place that serves Southern Vietnamese Pho. Honestly, best Pho I\u2019ve ever had. Flavors are excellent and exciting even for the picky eaters in my household. I order from this place whenever I\u2019m feeling sick and in need of a nice chicken soup, or whenever I am simply in the mood for a nice big bowl of Pho. Prices are very reasonable, you get a ton of delicious pho for what you pay for. More than worth it in my opinion. The drinks are also delicious, though a bit pricey for the size. Have had some of the rolls as well. I\u2019ve tried quite a few items on their menu and everything is A+ for me. Would eat from here every day if I could.",

The banh mi was delicious, bread was light and crusty, great ratio of meat to pickled veg and exactly the right spice level for my taste buds. Meats tasted like they were a cut above your average joint. They have direct online ordering (hate predatory Seamless/GrubHub) anddo curbside pick up. There was a small mix up with our order and the owner, Patrick, was super accomodating and even hooked us up with an order of spring rolls to make up for it. We scarfed our sandwiches and iced coffee in the car, but looking forward to eating the rest of our order when we get home.",

It had an edge to it that was distinct from most of the country's noodle soups offered in New York City. Fast forward to December and it is with happiness we can report that the hu tieu is still without equal, and the noodles are as good as ever. We also finally tried the pho ga, a chicken soup that is modified from the recipe of the chef's mother. It is good too, and offers a good switch so you do not have to order the same thing every time, although each is worth of that. The menu is still focused on dishes that the kitchen does well, and that is a good sign. \u00b0 New also to our post is the cha gio, fried spring rolls we ordered this time instead of the nem nuong rolls. All of the past and new info is updated on our page from April so if you missed that check it out now. Bensonhurst is an important place for Vietnamese in the city, home to what we think are the three strongest restaurants.",

The taste isn't isn't extra ordinary from what my family makes. It's missing an aromatic taste.  The pho my friend ordered has a overly aromatic taste that it goes the sense of salty savory from the Pho. There is only one type of Pho so if your looking for the beef round that cooks in the broth, try another restaurant.  The noodle soup is a bit expensive compared to other Vietnamese restaurants ($12-14l. Vietnamese noodle soups don't have the taste intracacies like Ramen to charge what Em charges.  Overall, Em is a nice restaurant for quick eats like Banh mi. Pass soon the noodle soups.",

I didn't try the banh mi but I did have the beef pho with short rib and it was delicious. Much closer to a homemade broth and so much better than the usual stuff you get on 8 Ave or 86 st under the train. You can tell how good pho is by the broth and this one had a clean, refreshing flavor but with lots of body. The beef pho didn't have tendon or tripe but that's ok with me. I also got a limeade drink and watermelon smoothie and both were also very refreshing. Came here on a Saturday 6pm and it wasn't that busy but lots of locals. Definitely worth a visit or even a short trip if you're craving good pho.",

The restaurant is cute and clean but rather tiny. Their menu seems to have more juice/Smoothie options than noodles and banh mi or other Vietnamese food which looks more like a juicy bar to me. When I was there the other day, the lady who made juice behind counter had been busy using the blender the whole time when I was having lunch which made the tiny restaurant rather noisy.",

If the owner of the restaurant looked up what Banh Mi means in Vietnamese they would see that it's pointing to BREAD.

The ingredients inside are typical but fresh which I commend this place for. The ice coffee is good, I think I would go there more for their coffee than the Banh Mi.  Nice Try...",
