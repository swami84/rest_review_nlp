        "caption": "Easily the worst Korean barbecue I've ever had! When we got there there was some weird rich kids fraternity thing going on! They were being super loud in the back room, breaking glasses shouting things it was really freaking weird. When we finally did get our food, the dumplings basically flavorless, ordered the Oriole combo The steak, pork, and brisket. The steak, when we started to cook it smelled the little funny I thought that might be the marinade. Then when I tasted it it's like no this steak is off. Admittedly the owner/manager whoever it was came out and had one of his people bring us the bulgogi as a replacement. He also sent over another order of dumplings, which I did not have the heart to tell him weren't very good. The pork, this was kind of like a very thick uncured bacon that may have been marinated in something may have not I have no idea. By the time it cooked off on the grill it just was almost flavorless. The little bit flavor that it did have wasn't pleasant. Brisket, no complaints here actually The brisket was actually pretty good. The bulgogi, this was the least flavorful bulgogi I have ever had. Seriously if you're going to get Korean BBQ and you are in the Maryland area. Drive 30 minutes up the road just outside Ellicott City and search for Korean barbecue places there.  If it wasn't for the fact that the food basically made both my wife and I ill I would not be writing one star review! If you look through my review history I very rarely ever give one-star reviews. I understand a kitchen / restaurant having an off day. This was more than that. Serving spoiled food. I felt like I was a customer on an episode of kitchen nightmares.",

The service took awhile, which was the only main downfall but that probably was because we were waiting for more people in our party. They had like 5-7 imported beers and some domestics on the menu. We got korean beers obviously...I've been really liking the klout beer. It's light with some body still. For food we ordered one of the family style platters. There was so much meat, it barely fit on the grill lol. The meat was delicious, even with some areas burning because of how the stove sets. The parking lot is tiny and one way so beware if busy.  Overall, I definitely recommend trying this place out. After 9:30 is all you can eat I'm pretty sure!!",

We've been to Iron Age before and liked it for the most part, but it was way too loud there. Kangnam felt more family-friendly. The attached ramen bar made my kids extremely happy too \ud83d\ude02 (They are ramen fanatics!) We ordered the Nationals BBQ combo, peach soju, Hite, Tonkotsu T black straight noodle, Shoyu classic wavy noodle, mango creamy soda, and an orange marble soda. The Hite beer was new to us and is similar to American lite beer with a sweeter aftertaste. Soju is similar to a wine cooler with a higher alcohol content. The kids loved their sodas and were super entertained by the marble soda. All of the meats from our platter were delicious! Not full of gristle or fat like other places. My favorites were the pork bulgogi, Kim chi, and pickled vegetables. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the Korean singing/dancing competitions they played on the TV. My kids loved their ramen and said they want to go back soon! We had loads of food to take home with us. Looking forward to breakfast tomorrow \ud83d\ude00",

I came to eat here with my buddy after much anticipation, we walked into the restaurant and the server walked right passed us without even considering to greet us. And best of all he wasn\u2019t even wearing his mask, I had to ask him to put his mask on. A couple of minutes later he comes back sits us down in the kbbq section as the ramen and kbbq are two separate sections. We proceed to order our meats the small Asian guy brings the meats out sets them on the table and then attempts to light the bbq grill. The bbq grill clearly needed to be replaced or get maintenance down on it since he struggled for several minutes to light it and while attempting to light it he put half of his body over the table which had the meats, sides and drinks. After much avail he finally got it to turn on, and then had to use a piece of wood so that the knob that regulates the fire wouldn\u2019t snap back to the off position. Every time he brought new meats he had to turn the grill back on and hovered over the table again and again.  The food was mediocre, we order the soy garlic boneless chicken and the \u201chot\u201d wings. These appetizers were terrible the hot wings had no flavor, the breading that it had was just one clunk of breading that when you lifted up the piece of chicken it completely fell off. DO NOT ORDER the hot wings nor the garlic chicken. We ate the soy chicken out of hunger but neither my friend or I could muster up the courage to even finish one piece of the hot wings.  The kbbq we ordered the brisket, the teriyaki chicken, spicy pork belly and their Kangnam steak. All of their meats were terrible, lacked flavor, their sauces did not help. My buddy and I were not finishing the meats because they were bad. To which we we\u2019re told by the small Asian man that we would be charged for anything we did not eat. Since we were forced to eat their food in order to try any other meats. My friend had to ask the server to bring us salt and pepper to give these meats some sort of taste.  All in all a terrible sh*itty experience  Will never come back.",

We were seated right away but not served as quickly. All of the servers look under the age of 25 and are probably college students given the location.  They probably spend more of their time avoiding coming to tables than they do actually looking for customers who need help. Every time we needed something we definitely had to flag one of them down. I've almost gotten to the place where I don't expect to get A1 service in Prince George's County. However, as long as you can wave, and shout 'Excuse me..\" You're good! All of us had the buffet option which is basically all you can eat of whatever meat options there are. And there are many! Beef, chicken, pork, and seafood along with bowls of rice, kimchi and pickled spicy ginger, lettuce and a variety of tasty sauces for dipping or dripping. The meats are prepared right there at your table on a cast iron grill. You do share responsibility with the wait person to make sure that your meat does not burn. Parking is tight and somewhat limited. But all in all definitely worth the trip. If you order the buffet everyone at the table has to order the buffet. also make sure you read the small print about leftovers They do charge if you order more than you can eat. Everything was pretty tasty and we sampled almost everything except the seafood. I recommend that you try a Korean BBQ at least once.",

The appetizers the cabbage and \u201csalad\u201d was not fresh at all. The salad was just lettuce no dressing. You were expected to get your own beverages out of the fridge along with soup which required you walking past the fridge with they kept the prepared meats for the BBQ.

When I objected, he got a new thing of kimchi but said \"it was only for  second...\" then he tried to serve my sister cooked meat using tongs from the raw meat. There was literally red bloody meat falling off the tongs!! When we objected he said \"you are just too sensitive\" and proceeded to tell me how they taste the seasoning of the meat before they cook it by EATING THE MEAT RAW!! He told me it was cultural and that in other places they eat everything raw. I have been to many different korean bbqs and i have NEVER experienced something like this.

It's cost effective, decent quality, and has always been a pretty good and laid back experience.  When we have gone with friends and family with children, they have really loved it and I have brought employees here for farewell dinners or lunches.  Great place, highly recommended.",

Honestly that's not a risk I'm willing to keep taking, especially since I'm paying for my own meal. Maybe a change of some servers or retrain staff?",

So raw food (pork and beef) would be mixed with already cooked items.

The saving grace was the dipping sauce and the bulgogi chicken. The kimchee was pretty good as well but the number of side vegetables was minimal. Sodas are only by the bottle. No need to return to try some of the other menu options though my kids think the ramen is OK.",

We were initially seated by a waiter I believe he was Indian? however that was the last we saw of him. He never came back to our table to cook the meat or refill waters etc. We tried to call him but he ignored us and all he did was walk up and down the aisle quickly looking around but really doing nothing. Luckily another waitress, Hannah, came to our table and saved our almost burnt meat. She was able to cook it just the right amount so it was not too tough. Exceptional service on her part, she was very friendly and helpful but the initial rude customer service by our first waiter ruined our experience. Great thanks to Hannah for the great service, however we will most likely not be coming back.",

The small platters that accompany the all-you-can-eat BBQ were pretty basic and sometimes didn't feel like it's something that you would normally get at a Korean BBQ restaurant. The place is clean and the staff are great but ultimately there are better places you can go if you're able to drive.  Edit: I went back twice since my review and I'm disappointed. All you can eat buffet is only for 90 mins once you get seated. Ok that's fair. What is not fair is that they ignore you after 2/3 rounds of meat hoping you won't flag them down and order more. They start off with EXCELLENT service and it just....dies. I was literally still hungry when I left. Id rather make the drive to other places further out.",

        "caption": "Having tried several Korean BBQ places over the past year, I would say this establishment is decent.  Sitting on the edge of a major road with lots of traffic, the restaurant parking can be difficult to turn into if coming southbound from the north. Additionally, parking is limited in their lot and the spaces are a bit cramped. Be prepared for dings in your car-door as people squeeze in and out.  Upon entering the restaurant, a friendly gentleman greeted me and my friend. Within 30 seconds, they got us seated. Although busy, the staff were quick to bring drinks and perceptive to notice when we were ready to order. It is a bit hard to keep track of your specific waiter as staff members switch out multiple times throughout your stay. It seems they go to the nearest tables opposed to having their set allocations. The staff made this work without issue, however.  One staff member was quite rude to other staff. At first glance, you'd think he was the manager or owner by the way he scolded other coworkers. However, reprimanding employees is best left away from customers in my opinion. The manager did come over mid-meal and ensure that our stay was going well though. He had a nice demeanor.  For the meal itself, we ordered the 'All you can eat' special. As customary for many of the Korean restaurants in the area, a diverse set of appetizers in tiny dishes are provided as part of the meal. The kimchi, white radish, and pickles tasted fresh and not overly vinegary. When ordering meats off the menu, the restaurant limits the table to 2 orders at a time. The bulgogi tasted a bit sweeter than I'm used to, but tender and juicy. Pork belly was thin but flavorful.  The shrimp was also fresh and well-seasoned. However, the menu doesn't tell you that the shrimp has an extra charge attached even though it's listed among the other meats included with the all you can eat deal. By the time a customer knows it'll cost extra (and it was a decent up-charge), they will have already eaten it and have to pay. Not the most transparent of pricing schema.  The sauces were mediocre in that the sesame oil sauce lacked seasoning and the other sauce (sweet and red) just tasted of sweetness. They added to the flavors of the meats, but didn't stand out in any way.  Overall, I would say the business could use with a couple dollars less on the pricing for the food. The amiable staff and calm environment do make this a fun place to visit on occasion, though. I would return if I really craved Korean food and didn't want to drive an extra 10 minutes to another place.",

We sat in the Ramen bar area, I\u2019ll be honest, we did come in at 8:30, when it closes at 11, but the rest of the building for the Korean BBQ closes at midnight, so it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Andrew, however was clearly frustrated. As someone who has worked as a server for the past 4 years, I was absolutely disappointed, when he spent the entire duration of our meal talking in plain sight (seating area) with his girlfriend. He even kissed her, in front of customers. He mentioned several times that 9 was the closing time and even printed our check, 2 minutes to close when we had been eating for less than 10 minutes. Normally I don\u2019t mind letting poor service slide, everyone has days where they aren\u2019t at their best, but this was clearly not the case. Andrew obviously wanted to just spend time with his partner, and work is not the place for that. My boyfriend commented that the pushiness and poor service had ruined his night out, and I was also irritated. I really hope management will step in and solve this issue or that Andrew will grow up and realize that it isn\u2019t bring your girlfriend to work day.",

I thought it was something againsy us until I saw him do the same to the new group of people who came in. He wasn't rude but wasn't welcoming either. I had to go back and tell him that we want ramen because he only gave us Korean BBQ menus. The flopped those on the table too and left. There was one waiter for a room full of people and he was very laid back like if shaggy was a real person. He was cool and attentative as one could be when he was servicing many people. The service didn't leave me feeling warm and fuzzy but the food was fantabulous. Yes it is now a word. I loved the Shoyu ramen. It was much better than any ramen that I ever had. I feel cheated by only having shin ramen my whole life. Thats good but this was amazing. My children had takoyaki and I veggie gyoka. I can't eat seafood so I had to avoid it. My son had tonkasu- tokoyo and my daughter had tonkasu spicy red or something. We raved and we were full. I want to come back again. Since this is in a college town I'll ignore the hurried service for now. Also, there is sensory overload. They were playing Korean music, they had a korean music show on and then another tv with a soccer match. I didnt know where to look",

Second, they use very low quality meats in the the food. The brisket meat was very tough and hard to chew. The beef bulgogi tasted like ground beef with bbq sauce in it.  Third, they sneak in mandatory charges for tip (20%) whether you want to pay for it or not.  Fourth, they do not provide many of the traditional sides that other K-BBQ places do.  I hope that another K-BBQ place opens up nearby so that they are forced to compete.",

It includes however much rice you want, side vegetables, some basic soup and your choice of meats: beef bulgogi, chicken bulgogi, pork shoulder, pork belly, or spicy pork belly.  For more premium cuts, you can pay an additional 2-8 dollars per person.  We went through two orders of beef bulgogi, 1 spicy pork belly and 1 pork shoulder.  The included soups are nothing home to write home about...but if you're eating here, you should be focused on the grilled meat anyway, which was amazing.  We found service to be quick and friendly.
