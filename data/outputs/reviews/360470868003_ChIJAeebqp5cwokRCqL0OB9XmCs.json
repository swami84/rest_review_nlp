It looks like nothing was really available at the time I went but the lady was extremely nice and asked what I wanted right away I ask for fried fish white rice with oxtail gravy and a salad. It took a while for it to get ready I was assuming that it was either being heated up or done fresh. I was right on the heating up part. I ignored all the signs their card reader was down, they didn't have change, so I ended up burning out all my singles. That would have been all okay if the food was good. Let's fast-forward home. I open up what looked presentable and was completely utterly disappointed. The food was not sellable at all nor was it edible. The fried escovitch was probably fried from days prior completely dried out and even tasted freezer burned from the small edible pieces. The white rice a saturated. The salad was I already Brown and the tomatoes were soggy. The greens tadted worst than krasdale branded greens. It was a waste of $16 period first and last time I'm ever going there. I couldn't even give it to pot starving (yes bajans yes!!!) if I was to purpose the 1 one-star for anything it will be the Stellar customer service, bit stellar customer service isn't enough to make me ever come back. Father forgive me for wasting food, but I wouldn't give that to my worst enemy. Luckily I would suede the next day. I have to review them",

The lady was very friendly and we ordered an ok meal of akee and saltfish and a plate of scrambled eggs with one homemade ginger beer that we shared, we felt that the lady thought I was a tourist since I was the only white lady there in a predominantly black neighborhood with my Jamaican born husband so she must have felt it was okay to charge us $57 and pocket the money. Not only will we never eat at this spot again but we will be aure to steer everyone we can away from this thief. All future meals out will be at J and S restaurant at 352 Utica avenue, the food was terrific and a normal price of $12 for a large serving of oxtail and rice and peas, in fact so good that we went back for more.
