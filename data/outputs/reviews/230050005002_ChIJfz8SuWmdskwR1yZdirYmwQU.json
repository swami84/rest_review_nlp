The chicken is great. We ordered a few pieces of dark meat and some buffalo wings. The fried chicken is lightly breaded, and has good seasoning. It\u2019s not like the fried chicken you would get from one of the big chains that is all breading, so I liked that. The buffalo wings were also very good. The sides like the mozzarella sticks and onion rings are ok. Nothing amazing there, but still a good value. My only complaint is that they only sent one tiny cup of ranch for a big order of wings. Overall a great value and tasty chicken. I would order from here again even if it wasn\u2019t the only place open!",

I had to pay to get the rental car from the valet parking deck and drive to the restaurant (after already paying Uber Eats $50+) to get utensils, etc. The woman behind the counter had the audacity to tell me I would be charged for sauces.

Not to mention it's all pre-breaded, pressed frozen chicken. The \"hot wings\" I ordered were weird shaped McD's style nuggets. It took 30+ plus minutes to get out food (we walked in and ordered) and seeing how disheveled the cook(owner?) was, I don't think it'll last a year. The girl behind the counter couldn't care less and we actually received part of someone else's order in addition to our own.  If they happen to read this; pare down your menu and actually fry the chicken. Fry wings (real wings), breasts, thighs etc. Maybe offer a grilled chicken sando alternative. But definitely cut down your menu from 80+ to 10.",

We had the chicken, of course, with fries, and the shrimp with rice. The chicken was moist, not at all fatty, with a flavorful and light batter. The fries were delish yummy flavorful soft-on-the-inside and slightly crunchy outside. The shrimp were also super moist and flavorful-but neither was overseasoned!-and that rice, hey, that was gorgeously light, fluffy and flavorful basmati, Yom.

The manager and the workers were well mannered and very kind genuine people. I feel very welcomed at the restaurant; not only was the food good but so was the customer service. The fried chicken was very crispy and mouth watering as well as the gyros. I\u2019d definitely recommend this restaurant, I\u2019ll be back here!",
