This was controversial at the time- if lightning struck the temple, how would the people of Rome know which god was angry at them? Hadrian brushed off the haters and built a masterpiece, topped with the biggest dome the world had ever seen. The Pantheon, as it came to be known, still stands today- proof that something powerful happens when all your divinities get together in one place.  What I\u2019m saying is, Brooklyn Hero Shop is the Pantheon of hot sandwiches. On the wall you\u2019ll see plaques with the 12 names for god- hoagie, grinder, sub, etc. They\u2019ve got a deep roster of Italian classics- your parms, your porchetta broccoli rabes (pictured), your cutlets. But they don\u2019t stop there! Respect is given to all the great ones: Nashville Hot Chicken, Philly Cheesesteak, Po\u2019 Boy, Reuben.  Just like in days of yore, haters will scoff at the attempt to crank out so many regional classics at once. Maybe that\u2019s fair; within walking distance are places that specialize in each of the above sammies. But BHS is right there up there with all of them.",
