The Staff: friendly and warm, they simply have too much to do and are too busy to baby you. They are quick, efficient and courteous! They have NEVER gotten my order wrong, and often find me wherever I am in the store to ask questions about my order. While online I often see rude or difficult customers who are sucking their teeth and being rude to the staff, they are probably the same customers leaving poor reviews about the service.  The place seems to get crowded for lunch, I'm noticing the biggest crowds so far around 12:20-12:50. But the lines move quickly. The staff is patient with indecisive customers.  Sandwiches & Wraps: A simple hero or roll will cost you between $5-7. Some specialty items and bigger sandwiches will cost you $7-10  Hot Bar: I have yet to try their hot bar which offers platters, rice, noodles etc. While it looks delicious the sandwich bar won me over.  Credit Card: $10 minimum for cards  Drinks: Standard prices for drinks mostly $1-2 some costing $3-4  Seating: There is room to sit 28 people. A few tables are single, most are double so if they are crowded expect to sit next to strangers.  Cleanliness: The place is fairly clean. Chefs are constantly wiping down surfaces and cutlery. The staff often cleans the tables and wipes them down as well.  OVERALL: I would highly recommend Hero Champ. It's steps away from the hipster food court of Industry City. There is a deli just across the street but I have not had any desire or urge to check them out, as Hero Champ satisfies my hunger needs. I visit them 2-3 times a week for my work lunches.",
