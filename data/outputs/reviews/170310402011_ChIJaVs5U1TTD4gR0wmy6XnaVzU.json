Speaking to this location, we walked over on a whim one day in early summer, and have been back many times since!  We've tried a few smoothies: all the menu items have been good, and if you try to mix something up that might be off (too watery, etc) they will warn you. My favorite so far is the Triple Berry Oat with peanut butter added.  They also have some great sandwiches. We've tried a few now, starting with the Chipotle Chicken on their recommendation (still my favorite). Also, the kale and apple slaw is shockingly tasty, and I'm no health nut.  Overall reasonable price for a sandwich and a smoothie, or to just stop in for a smoothie, and the service has always been friendly! You can also grab their app to order in advance for contactless pickup.",

The young lady that took my order was super helpful and polite and took the curbside order by phone. I ordered the Cali chicken club flatbread and the Detox Island Green smoothie. First off I stay about 17 minutes away from here, and found out about the place with a quick Google search for smoothie bars near me. I enjoyed the smoothie on my way home, it's supposed to have ginger in it however I didn't quite taste it, but the smoothie tasted healthy! When I got home I noticed that the flat bread was missing the bacon, I called to let them know and the guy apologized and asked if I wanted to come back, I declined as I did not want to make another trip. An awkward silence followed his second apology, and then click...  Everything was yummy which is why I'm giving 4 stars, they should have offered either a refund or a discounted item next visit. I'll give them another shot because that flatbread was delicious, but I will bring this up next visit...",

I placed my order online through the website and I came a bit earlier than I said I would. When I arrived, my drink wasn't ready, but they started making it immediately when I got to the counter.  I had a dragonfruit smoothie and it was amazing. They definitely use real fruit and you could definitely tell from the taste. Its a huge 24 oz drink and they totally fill it to the top. They do offer curb side delivery, pick up obviously, and I believe delivery options as well. There is parking by the McDonalds lot next door and right outside of the store entrance so don't have to worry about meters here.  Definitely will come back here to try their other shakes out!",
