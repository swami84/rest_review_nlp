I got the peanut yellow chicken; the sauce was creamy with lots of peanut flavor without being too sweet and the pickled veggies were crispy and delicious. Portion is large enough that I didn't even touch the rice. The Thai Ice Tea was good, sweet but not \"burns your throat after 3 sips\" sweet. Looking forward to trying the coffee and a few more menu items.",
