Then to top it off, I included my tip in my orders final price total. I paid with exact cash which my driver obviously didn\u2019t like, and decided to make the comment \u201cWow, exact change? It\u2019s the season of giving you know.\u201d when presented with payment. I did however like the updates given through email the company provides. But, when I sent an email asking how to place a review they told me there was no way to place one and to let them know my review. Surprise surprise, guess they knew it wouldn\u2019t be a very favorable one and I did not receive a response. Not knocking the company per say yet, but hopefully they have better customer service provided from their other drivers.",

Best delivery in town, which doesn't take much to be fair in comparison to the corporate entities that bowl you over with free French fries and credits within their poorly managed system. What first drew me to 352 six or so years ago was they had the most intuitive straightforward interface with up front fees that were reasonable for the convenience.  Since then, it has only continued to improve despite the flashy competitors eating up most of the other delivery services in Gainesville. It feels less manufactured, in a way that promotes trust that the business is fighting to remain a preferred service for the reasons that are not financially driven. It's been wonderful to see it progress and exceed competition.  I don't feel blown off when I ask them about an order and they communicate if there's an issue, and make every effort to ensure your driver can find you. This had been far from my experience with others (wanting half an hour to find out it's canceled after reaching out with no notice, completely disconnected drivers trying to deliver food from dispatchers who have never been in Gainesville... It makes a difference)  Gaineacille thrives from its local companies. 352 is the one to go with. Also, the acceptance of cash is a notable convenience.",

After running inside and calling my boss I find out that the employee won't be losing his job and they didn't take it seriously at all. Not to mention this was all caught on camera. Long story short don't use 352 delivery, it's an unregulated business that doesn't make their employees sign ANY food tampering paperwork. The delivery driver is still working here from my understanding, and this has been brought to the attention of the owner he doesn't seem to care either. Also google doesn't offer less than 1 star, in my opinion there should be negative stars.",

I highly recommend to use the other services in the city.  They were late by an additional 30 minutes and when I asked them why, the response I received was \"We are very busy.  What is your address?\" then after that they started giving excuses and when I told them that they should improve their service this was the answer \"You were the 20th person in a row to place an order from Bolay. But thank you. I hope you find what you are looking for with the other companies\". I am attaching the screen shots below.  This seems to be a company that has no idea about costumer service.

The order before that from falafel king was missing two sides and my taziki sauce. The sides they did give were just dumped full of humus (normally I'd love, but I'd already ordered an extra side of hummus and was looking forward to the tabuli). I reached out to the company via their chat service and never received a reply. It's a shame. I'll miss the convenience of ordering online and home delivery.  Update: I spoke with 352 and I guess there was some technical glitch with the chat service.... cause I waited and never saw a reply. But, I was really surprised when they took the time to find my information and reach out to me after they saw my review.  I spoke with Victoria and she was VERY understanding and had done all the work to reach out to me. She refunded the cost my missing items and was very kind. Because of her awesome service, I'm definitely going to give them another try! From one star to four in my book for being so good to me.",

Someone by the name of Jeremiah, who said he was the owner, answered the phone.  I explained to him the situation and he was very short and snippy with me. He then asked me what I would like him to do about it, in which I then asked to cancel my order. He did not provide an apology or an explanation as to what the hold up was, but did agree to cancel the order and not charge me. No type of apology whatsoever.  Yes, I'm glad that I won't be charged and that my order was canceled, but the way that I was treated by the owner was horrible. His tone and the way he spoke to me was unprofessional and did not reflect that of someone who should be running any business at all.  If the owner treats their customers in such a manner, I can only imagine how that trickles down to the staff members and 352 Delivery's work culture.  I have ordered from 352 delivery in the past, and have had no problems, but this one encounter has caused me to move my business elsewhere and I will suggest to my colleagues that they do the same. Customer service is a significant pillar of a great business, and I hope that you all strive for that in the future with your customers.",

Mind you, I work for a company similar to this that delivers from all different restaurants - we are alerted when cutlery is needed or anything extra via email. This was pure laziness on the driver's part. So, thank you. As if our food wasn't already cold enough from the wait, we had to go buy silverware due to us staying at a hotel.  To make things worse, I prepaid a 20% tip. I'd suggest not tipping up front because it doesn't help the service.  If you want your food late, expensive, and missing things. Order here  Response to owner: we requested plastic ware. That is directly your driver's/dispatch's fault for not double checking the customizations. It has nothing to do with the restaurant. That was your driver's/dispatch's carelessness. As a matter of fact, the food was almost a half an hour late. Your driver must have dooped you, and told you she dropped when she didn't. The fact that she showed up looking like she was under the influence of something didn't help. You guys really need to get this straightened out, your reviews are all the same. There also will be no ordering from you again, I'd rather pick it up and enjoy my food HOT, and not have someone deliver to me who appeared to be under the influence. Also, the fact that the food didn't arrive in a thermal and just bagged is also a problem, I'd suggest investing in some of those to keep you're customer's food warm/cold. Somethings gotta give.",
