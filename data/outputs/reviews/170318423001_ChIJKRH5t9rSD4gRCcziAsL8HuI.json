The burger is legitimately one of the best in Chicago but is expensive at $16 for only a burger without sides.  The Crispy Chili Beef is $22 for barely any meat. It had a strong coriander flavor and was overall okay.  The everything wings were good enough but they came with tzatziki sauce which made no sense and didn\u2019t go well together.  Overall I was only impressed by the burger but the prices for such small portions make it hard to want to go again.",

Basically threw our check at us because we weren't worth his time for a $50 bill. We will not be returning.  To be fair... Pros: Cute laid back outdoor space for COVID safe dining, unique asian fusion menu with interesting apps, mains and desserts. Important to note the menu is def is for non-picky eaters, but the fire chicken was fire.  Cons: Extremely small portions that are ridiculously overpriced, even tho artfully done. More than half the menu is made with fish sauce, pork or beef. The beer/cider list was extremely short and disappointing which is why didn't order more than 1 drink each. We also avoided the cocktails at $13 bc of current economy as local artists and IMO that's inflated NYC pricing. I think their menu pricing is greedy. It's 2020, guys.",

The waiter was charming but the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 very keen on getting us out of the restaurant as soon as possible despite the fact that it took them a half an hour to even seat us for the reservation. I don\u2019t know even post Covid whether I would ever go back. I would probably have given this a three star had I not spent so much for the evening.

Perfectly balanced.  \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e Mott St. is one of our favorite spots to hang out. Not just brunch, their lunch and dinner menu is amazing too. It's Korean street food, inspired by Chinese, Japanese, Thai and even Mexican cuisine, and all of the items are to die for. During Summers, they open up their beautifully decorated patio too. With communal seating, plates to share, fun yet sophisticated food, prompt service, and super friendly staff, there's nothing more we could've asked for.  Pro Tip - They serve one of the best cheeseburgers in Chicago.",

I recommend the everything chicken and the pork dumplings. One person in my party ordered the fried rice...that I do not reccomend. I suggest that the receipe is reconsidered for better flavoring. Other persons in my party only wanted to come for the famous burger to only find out that they would have to go sit at the bar to eat it becuase it's not served at the dining tables?! Never heard such a rule at a restaurant. That was disappointing. Hence the reason for the 3 stars. That's a weird rule that should eventually be reconsidered espically if it's the house favorite and a city known dish. Good place to go though.",

        "caption": "I had been to Mott street about 2 years ago for their brunch and felt sort of neutral towards it because we really liked their burger but weren't a fan of a noodle dish that we had ordered. But I decided to give them another try because I love Asian fusion food, the yelp food pics look SO GOOD, and because of the great ratings. So I came here for dinner on a Friday evening. I had made reservations several days in advance (and even then they had limited times available) which I would highly recommend doing cause this place gets busy. Although my reservation was for 8:15PM, we ended up getting there 30 minutes early and were still able to get seated right away.  We started off with cocktails (these are $12 or $13) which were great. Our waitress recommended 4-5 plates for two people. The one thing I didn't like about this place is that you have to order all the dishes at once. It would've been nice to start off with a few and order more if we were still hungry but they insisted on ordering everything at once. So we got the Kimchi & oaxaca empanadas ($11), pork jowl ($16), and stuffed cabbage ($19). We had also ordered the short rib but they somehow forgot about it and I'm kinda glad cause we were pretty full after 3 dishes.  The empanadas were delicious - perfectly crispy with a great filling and dip. The pork jowl was my favorite item. It was a complex blend of sweet and spicy. It comes with cabbage which you use to make cabbage wraps. I've never had cabbage like this but actually really liked it. I saw so many great pics of and reviews raving about the stuffed cabbage so I was excited to try this but it ended up being my least favorite dish of the night. It was good, but not great and I wasn't blown away. Also you should avoid this dish if you have a shellfish allergy!! I do and the waitress had told me that although there's no cross contamination in their kitchen, apparently their kimchi is fermented in such a way that there could be contamination from before it comes to the restaurant. I decided to take a chance and try it anyway but did have just a bit of a reaction to it. I was fine with the kimchi empanadas though. On a side note, I was bummed that their famous burger is only available during certain times. Like whyyyy??? :/  Overall Mott street has delicious food and a great ambiance! I love the decor here with beautiful red Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The place is both chill and fun while also being hip and trendy. I also like that they have plenty of outdoor seating.",

Apple cider old fashioned is hands down the best drink I've ever had. Atmosphere is cozy and clean. Service is usually really good. I've been there 5 times since Jan 2019 and service was great every time except the last time. I went on a Thursday at 6pm when it opened, sat at the bar, the restaurant was completely empty, and it took 26 minutes before we received our drink order, not to mention no one even offered, we had to ask to receive some service. Other than that, great experience every time. Highly recommend!",

The rabbit laap and pork sisig large dishes were our favorites, both very complex and both VERY tasty. The pork jowl medium dish and tofu small dish were also very good, both hitting on the sweeter notes. The Nam Prik Rita was my favorite cocktail, spicy and full. The dessert was also a very refined spin on mango sticky rice. All elements of it weren\u2019t that special alone but with then combined, the flavor was just right. Mott St has become one of my top 4 restaurants in the city, up there with Kitsune, Avec, and Roister. Thank you Mott St and thank you Lindsey for an AMAZING experience.",

        "caption": "Great draw with a beautiful venue and a cool hipster-vibe and a bare-bulb lit patio right along Ashland brought me in. A glance at the menu suggests a thrilling combination of ideas drawing on numerous asian and latin cuisines with a hint of American influence. We ordered steamed pork dumplings, imperial rolls, mentaiko kimchi udon, pork jowl, and gai lan. In order; the pork dumplings had good flavour but the wrappers were not as delicate as I would expect, it was like they didn't roll the edges thin enough so when they brought them together it became chewy and doughy. The imperial rolls were served with lettuce, bean sprouts, and mint; the bean sprouts weren't Frenched and the lettuce was rather unwieldily sized to the point where we tore off chunks to make it reasonable to wrap. The udon was quite creamy and thick with a mild spice flavor which, in my admission I didn't expect because I was not familiar with mentaiko style noodles so I can't fault them for this but I was hoping for a spicy, light seafood flavor and I got something closer to udon mac and cheese with bonito flakes. The pork jowl lacked the dark char I was hoping for and came off more like an al pastor taco filling on a plate served with a quarter of a cabbage than a well executed wrap. All those aside, the gai lan was perhaps the biggest offender of missed execution to me. When I read 'wok smoked gai lan with eggplant, cashew, and oyster sauce' I'm looking for a brightly green charred gai lan with a mix of small eggplant pieces, cashew bits, and an even coating of a rich seafood or mushroom seasoned sauce accompanied by a delicious ephemeral wok hei; what was served was nothing like the above. The gai lan was bright green but lacked any semblance of char, the eggplant was sizable and, while well cooked, totally out of place due to the size of the chunks, and instead of a light coating of a rich umami sauce the entire plate was drowned in a very sweet sauce that completely overpowered any notion of wok hei that may have existed. Maybe I had a one-off bad experience, but for me those great ideas and fusion flavours I saw on the menu just did not actualize in my meal and the execution I hope for in a moderately expensive meal just was not there. That said, the front of house was very well run and they were quite attentive to water levels on a hot day. I'll keep Mott St on my radar because I think it has potential but I'll give it some time as it left a mediocre impression.",

The interior is pretty rustic, most notable thing inside were the lights. Surprisingly, from the outside, you'd imagine a bigger space, but it's pretty cramped inside. The tables don't have much space on them, due to plates, utensils, etc. I find that space could be saved if utensils were brought out later for each dish, instead of already on the table; however, that's just my personal opinion. First item was Kalbi & Eggs. The meat was very tender, very juicy and perfectly seasoned. The kimchi hash that accompanied it was, surprisingly, very flavorful. The side of cauliflower was very bland. I was expecting it to be tangy or have some sort of vinaigrette. It was literally just blanched cauliflower and some other vegetables mixed together, not seasoned whatsoever. Next item was the Boat Noodles. I was expecting wider/thicker noodles, but was pleasantly surprised by thin rice noodles, thinner than vermicelli. The meat served with it literally melted in my mouth, it was braised very well. Moving on to the next dish, the Pork Belly Benedict. This is a sheer matter of opinion and it's pretty skewed, due to the fact that I decided to partake in the Boat Noodles first. The English muffin ended up being very soggy because my friend and I had left it there. The Boat Noodles and Pork Belly Benedict arrived at the same time. I made the decision to eat the noodles first because I didn't want them to get bloated. Had I known that the noodles were so thin, I would've left it and would've eaten the pork belly prior. I couldn't really make out the taste of it, but it wasn't bad tasting, that's for certain. The egg was perfectly poached and still very runny, even after being left to sit for a while. After so many savory dishes, we had the Cherry Bourbon Toast. It tasted perfectly good without the sauce that's served on the side. It didn't add much to the overall flavor of the dish. I ordered a side of longanisa and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. In my honest opinion though, they could have mixed a bit more fat into it, to give it a deeper profile. Finally, to end the meal, we ordered the Kimichi Fried Rice. This is the only item on the menu that we ordered that we didn't like. It wasn't bad but wasn't good either. We both admitted that we could've probably done better at home. The rice never got crispy, even when left to sit in the bowl. It also didn't come with any gochujung (spicy paste), which was a big let down. Again, overall experience left a good enough impression on me that I'd go back to try other things.",

Two of their signature dishes - Mentaiko Kimchi Udon and Stuffed Cabbage, or rather, rice lasagna with kimchi, completely blew me away when comes to taste, creativity and making otherwise staple, standalone ingredients - such as Kimchi - more accessible and even cool. The Mentaiko Kimchi udon is cooked in spicy cod roe and kimchi liquid, and resembles of a carbonara pasta in terms of make-up and viscosity. Taste-wise, absolutely love it: the udon was firm and the sauce is mildly sweet, sour, and flavorful from the fermented kimchi. The stuffed cabbage is my favorite dish. The layers of kimchi, slices of stewed pork, and scorched rice (nurungji) came together really well in the kimchi brine that wasn't at all overpowering.  Yet, I couldn't give Mott St a 5-star. Other dishes didn't quite hit the marks for me. In particular, I didn't like either the oyster mushroom and the bread, which were recommended by our waiter as a good combination. The mushroom tasted earthy but lacked flavor, and was simply too small of a plate to really share. The bread didn't quite work with the mushroom and $7 for a small loaf of bread is pushing it. Disappointingly, deserts were all quite meh for me.  All in all, a good experience if you know what to order. I also have heard great things about the burger but there are only select time during the day that it is served. For anyone wondering, yes, the name Mott St was said to be chosen to pay homage to NYC Chinatown.",

We were told we could only order one time, being a small plates restaurant that is pretty unwelcoming, there was also a tasting menu this evening that we were never given the option of. The service was utterly miserable our server and the rest of the staff behaved like they didn\u2019t want to be there and also like they were better than all the patrons. I would highly recommend avoiding this place as food was decent, black pepper szcheun shrimp were awful, really piss poor tempura and were served at room temperature not to mention 4 of the 7 dishes we ordered were all served at once yet again defeating the purpose of going to a small plate restaurant where dishes should be spaced out.  The chef and owner should be embarrassed by their staff and representation of their restaurant.",

A lot of the seating is cafeteria style (long tables where strangers are sat next to each other), so be aware if that bothers you at all.  While waiting for my friend to arrive, had a couple cocktails while talking to the bartender (Alex), who really knew her stuff. Both drinks were very well made, complex and tasty.  In terms of food, we ordered a variety of items, and were happy with all of them! In terms of our favorites of this trip though, I'd have to go with the bone marrow, short ribs, and everything wings. That being said, given my success with this place twice in a row, I'd say you're probably safe picking anything on the menu that sounds appealing. Definitely recommend a trip here if you get the chance.",

If I had someone working in my restaurant who 1) didn't enjoy speaking with people, 2) was uninterested in making customers' experience excellent, 3) would only give quick and rigid responses to questions, then I would probably avoid placing that person on the server team.  If I was going to mention a unique technique on my menu, such as onsen egg, then I would make sure that the people preparing that menu item knew what an onsen egg is and were able to deliver it accurately.  If I were to own a restaurant, I would make sure that the chefs and cooks knew how to properly salt food.  First and foremost, though, if I ever own a restaurant, I'll be sure to treat the customer kindly and with respect, and I'll make sure I only employ people who do the same.  Eating at Mott Street gave me some time to ponder these ideas, and it would likely inspire you to similarly consider things to avoid if you ever own a restaurant.  But if you're looking for delicious food and a great experience, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.",

Yes, they had some pretty awesome tasting unique dishes. They are not vegetarian friendly. The serving is small so always get way more than what you think you can eat. Also sell your kidney before your walk in, so you can pay for your meal. More than 4 sets of people came and went to the table adjacent to Ours after looking at the menu (so I take it that their food is not for everyone).  The awesome fusion dishes arent any good when served poorly by a wait staff who exudes rudeness nor, when its pouring rain - mid way during out meal it started raining and we were not permitted to move to a sheltered empty table( which reminded empty thought out unpleasant experience there.) Their much fancied burger is nothing to write home about either- makes me wonder : why I sold my kidney to eat there in the first place.  Overall, I don't see myself going there again.",

The bone marrow was good with a nice fragrant black rice. I found the short ribs to be a little too rare for my liking. The texture was soft and difficult to chew. Usually short ribs should be cooked more well done so that it\u2019s caramelized and firm. The mango sticky rice was really nice, albeit a small portion for the price.

The scallops were a must-have, they were rich, tender, and nicely undercooked. The short rib was good. The calamari and dumplings were fun additions to the meal but neither were wonderful. The black cod was very underwhelming. The fish itself is very tender, and serving it in a gooey sweet soy sauce with soft veggies was a big disservice. Certainly not worth the $26. I had a delicious and unique cocktail: A Night in Tunisia. I recommend that drink. Overall, good meal, but very small portions, it's pretty pricey, and the food execution is hit or miss.",

Unexpected Combination of miso creamy cheese, fried sweet potato strings, pickles and delicious pillowy bun made for a delicious Burger. Did not enjoy the gratuitous pickle on the side, and I usually love any pickle. we also very much enjoyed the boat noodles which had a delicious gingery Asian beef broth the noodles could have been a little better on the texture, I would have preferred a wider, egg noodle with this type of broth. But overall I did enjoy the boat noodles. We also enjoyed the Kohlrabi shrimp salad, although the candied shrimp had a bit of a stale taste to them. The cocktails were both delicious I enjoyed the peaches and cream as well as the Champapina. The bar staff were very attentive and I enjoy peeking in the kitchen.",

But you can't get it unless your sitting at the bar.  It's weird, but it's their thing.  Also, the bar is small, so try to go during \"off peak\" hours.  The bartenders are great, and the beer line up is solid.  They also have a patio, but go have a drink on the patio after you had the burger at the bar.",

The food is good but very overpriced. They are very simple Asian dishes just garnished and presented to look exotic and costly. As recommended by the server we ordered 6 dishes for a party of four and we all left hungry, while our check was close to a $100 without drinks. You would need to spend at least 35+ per person to fill up and for that price there are plenty significantly better alternatives. The kitchen can\u2019t keep up and as an excuse they say it\u2019s a  \u201cfamily style dining\u201d, whatever that's supposed to mean. I understand that in many Asian cultures it is a custom to share food, but from my experience, it is served all at the same time or in close proximity. While here we waited an hour for a minute ball of rice to come out and  another 20-30 min for each dish thereafter. The summer vibe and the nice outdoor patio is very appealing and that\u2019s why we decided to give it another try, but that doesn't compensate for all other shortcomings. Go to Parsons if you're looking for that. Frontier is right down the street, also very good and with nice outdoor seating, although the food is a little bit heavier there. One good thing was service. The server was knowledgeable and attentive.",

It\u2019s the best burger I have had in Chicago (yes, I\u2019ve been to Au Cheval; yes, it is better)... so worthy!  Now, things you need to know ... You can get the burger at the bar any time but if you want to get it on a table I think it only between some specific times and brunch (double check before going, or sit at the bar), the burger is just incredible.

Rustic and cozy vibe with super uncomfortable bench seats or metal chairs and community style tables in a very tight space. Also means it's very loud and hard to hear the person/people you came with because you're so close to other patrons. Tried three different glasses of wine: an orange, a white and a red. All were mediocre and were not liked by any of the three of us in my group, but cost $13/each. Food was average in my opinion but the others thought it was very good. Nothing particularly special or different from other places. Tried 9 of the small dishes. They say all are meant to be shared family style, but they are very small portions and expensive. Nice presentation of dishes and definitely very \"trendy\" place with a long line waiting to get in before it even opened.",
