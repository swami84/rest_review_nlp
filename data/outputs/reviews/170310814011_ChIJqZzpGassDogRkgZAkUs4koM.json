Had a wonderful lunch at The Albert restaurant.\u00a0 It is located on the ground floor of the EMC2 hotel.\u00a0 An intimate space The decor is very interesting, an ecclectic mix.\u00a0 There are authentic vintage library items such as thousands of books, bookshelves, even the car deck system from old libraries.  It's a gorgeous space that reeks of old-time class.  As others have mentioned, the service was slow even being on a weekday where there were only six other patrons  We had the Smoked Sturgeon (auguachile, fennel and cucumber) and the Skirt Steak with a sunny side egg & tomato hollandaise.  Both items were delicious and I would not hesitate to go back here again once they reopen.",

It was a fiery, boozy martini... amazing! I was really craving some carbs so we started with the bread and butter. It is a delicious small loaf of bread right out of the oven. We quickly moved onto the poached foie gras. I've never had it prepared poached before so it was interesting to try it that way. The charred octopus was phenomenal. There was a lot more octopus than I was expecting the flavors were unique and delicious.  We then split the rabbit and duck and were very impressed with everything. Both meats were very tender and juicy but very different flavors. I was too full to try and of the desserts but I look forward to coming back and trying some.  It was a pricey meal but you get what you pay for. Or just go for a drink and enjoy the amazing space. I will definitely be back again!",

Our server was wonderful! While she was assisting other tables, the manager went to get our bill (my date prepaid for dinner because he didn\u2019t want me knowing the total. I appreciated this gesture because I didn\u2019t want to know the cost of the meal and be worried about how much was spent on me.. )  So instead of worrying I get to be treated today, so we hoped. Unfortunately, for some reason when she (the manager working tonight) brought us our check, she announced the $228 prepaid total and then announced the additional cost of drinks... it really took away from the special feeling of being treated. It was also just a bit tacky. Most people know, when you buy someone an expensive (or even not expensive) gift, you don\u2019t leave the price tag on.. just like you don\u2019t read the bill aloud to the table.  The people sitting next to us even said something, because they had the same prepared meal and he didn\u2019t want his date to know either. I tried to catch her before leaving to politely let her know this instead of writing this on a review, but maybe she noticed we were disappointed and avoided us .. she instead sent the waiter back after she took away from the wonderful dining experience the waiter worked so hard to create. it felt tacky and careless.. it\u2019s also just not nice to do to your waiters.  Regardless of the last min hiccup of the night from the manager... everything else was wonderful and we will be back. And if that dining experience ends better, than I will be happy to add the additional star. The menu is extremely creative and I have to say, the dishes prepared for each zodiac sign was so unique and spot on to my date\u2019s and my tastes. We hope to find the Buffalo Carpaccio and the Coal Roasted  Beef on the menu again!!!  Update:  Thank you for the response, Aislyn! I really appreciate you taking the time on such a busy night to. I also appreciate you clarifying that you were just pulled away, because we waiting a min at the front. I wasn\u2019t upset or concerned at all by the prepayment or which menu was which.. just the announcement of the cost of the meal at the table. I just wasn\u2019t suppose to know how much everything was. We also are use to a bill being set down and leaving us to ask for help if we Feel we need it.  Also, the server was Kelli and briefly man who ran food, mostly Kelli. She was very engaging and thorough while moving very fast to so many tables.",

Always running around to other places being disappointed until my most recent trip. I booked reservations for lunches and dinners in advance this time but did not have an opening for this restaurant in my schedule, or so I thought. After a day of travel I just wanted to check-in, eat dinner, and relax. I booked my party a reservation at a seafood restaurant close by and was excited to try the place. I would use the word unfortunately but it was worse than that word implies. The restaurant I had reservations at said they could not seat us even though tables were empty. It was ok because we were early but took a turn to the worst when a couple came in and the man  asked (they knew each other and tried to come to an arrangement without anyone else hearing) this fat old man at the host station if there were any open tables cause they're a walk-in (meaning: no reservations). The fat old man and vapid women at the host station knew the couple and gave these two individuals a large four person table. I was filled with disgust witnessing happen right in front of my party. We abruptly walked out and were followed by one of the moron hostesses cause they were worried we would give them a bad review. I knew what I was going to do. I was headed back to my hotel with The Albert in it to try and have a good meal. My group throughly enjoyed ourselves at The Albert and laughed at ourselves for trying that pretentious derivative seafood joint. Thank you Albert.",

Not only the food was amazing and the decoration is extremely cool, reassembling an old library, but 6 hours later I've noticed I had forgot my wallet there and they quickly confirmed they had it with all the items inside, including some dollar bills. Great food, great decoration, great service and honest people. Highly recommended!",

My team held a dinner and he was really cool about letting me ask questions, shared food knowledge, and made us a special dish of a pistachio pesto gnochetti with like some type of cream foam cheesy deliciousness. The dish was light citrusy earthy and delicious. He also has an awesome grey streak in his hair. The atmosphere of the place is cool and drinks were amazingly balanced but he was definitely the best part.",

I believe that the simplest dish could tell the quality of one restaurant, and the bread was really fresh and delicious. I also think no one should miss the \u201cPoached Foie Gras\u201d, the creative presentation was special, and the taste was unexpectedly good. As for the main, the hangar steak was really delicious as well. I tried the drink Angostura Sour, was very delighting. It mixed gin, lime, and egg white, pretty smooth mouthfeel. Nice ambience, nice music. However, room for improvement was the service, the waiter did not ask about  how we want the steak to be cooked ( thankfully it was medium rare). Also they did not ask about if we want to add salt etc. I hope they could improve next time. Follow instagram @liying_chou",

We started with the Venison carpaccio which was just as beautiful as it was delicious. I had the Scallops in lemon grass fomage. It had a light citrus flavor and was mouthwatering. My friend had the duck breast which was so succulent with just right right amount of crunch on the skin. For dessert we shared the apple tart with rosemary mousse and a toasted cheese cracker. So unique and so good. Albert's was a great experience, I highly recommend it.",

Enter through the main EMC2 entrance for seating by an attentive host staff\u2014reservations recommended as this small restaurant can get very busy at prime times. The tables provide configurations for parties of various sizes and include heavy, comfortable chairs and upholstered couch-style seating. The ambiance is dim and hip with up-beat music, fanciful art, and a mix of bookcase d\u00e9cor, including the big wall of books, that really just feels fresh, fun, and a little romantic. Serving and bar staff is busy but seems a bit overwhelmed at times. The bar is small but nice and perfect for small get togethers. The drink menu is interesting and inventive. The drink Her Name was Vivian (vodka, lemon, egg white, violette) was tasty and foamy. The drink Don\u2019t Tell Your Mother was a strong martini with spicy and mescal laced hints (if you like mescal and martini\u2019s, get this one). The dinner menu is not large but is interesting with a variety and inventiveness that makes decisions difficult. The quality of the food shows the kitchen is staffed with very skilled professionals. Definitely get the Housemade Breads with Cultured Butter\u2014great variety of breads and good butter. I did not like the General Tso\u2019s Spiced Nuts\u2014very nice presentation but the cooked coating on the nuts was just too bitter to really enjoy. The Saffron Pressed Melon, Quinoa and Cashew Butter was simply incredible\u2014get this appetizer! The Colorado Lamb Shoulder with Black Garlic and Lentils was dark, heavy, and deep\u2014get this dish if you\u2019re feeling like something that\u2019s excessively meaty and rich. The Fjord Sea Trout Dill, Golden Beets and Creme Fraiche is overwhelmingly good with crispy skin, luscious fish, and one of the tastiest fish dressings I\u2019ve ever encountered. The Southern Fried Goodness (Bread Pudding Doughnut, Vanilla Anglaise, Brown Butter) was absolutely delightful and fit perfectly with a strong espresso. The prices are good; overall, I rate this restaurant as a good value for great location, bustling staff, great ambiance, inventive menu, good food, and good price. Recommended for a nice evening for couples in downtown Chicago.",
