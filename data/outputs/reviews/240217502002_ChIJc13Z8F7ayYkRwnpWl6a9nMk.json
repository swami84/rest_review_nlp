The oatmeal cookies are delicious. 4 stars, would return",

It was a nice evening to eat our meal out in little Courtyard. We placed a large order of frozen meals to take home and we'll enjoy them in the weeks to come; arepas, chicken noodle soup, chicken empanadas, dairy free cinnamon rolls and lasagna. We also picked up GF cookies for dessert and GF muffins for breakfast. I also saw that they have free delivery within a 10 mile radius and flat rate delivery two other areas.

        "caption": "I\u2019d give these guys 1,000 stars if I could!!  I cannot stress enough how incredibly happy I am with Sanctuary Modern Kitchen!!! These guys are true heroes! They are a 100% gluten free bakery who make the most delicious empanadas ever!! My best friend was diagnosed with Celiac a few years ago and all she wanted at her bridal shower was empanadas like the ones my mom used to make for her when she would come over.  After searching online for a dedicated gluten free kitchen that made empanadas, Sanctuary came up, but they were an hour and a half away from where the shower was taking place. I took a shot and called them anyways to see if there was something we could do, and these guys pulled through big time!!! They met me half way and delivered the most delicious empanadas I could imagine in an extremely professional and orderly way: individually wrapped and in a cooler full of ice for the drive home.  The empanadas were an absolute hit at the party, and everyone was shocked to hear that they were gluten free. Even my mom, the empanadas connoisseur, gave them her highly coveted seal of approval. Absolutely phenomenal! My friend actually actually screamed with delight when she saw them and couldn\u2019t stop eating them.  Thank you guys so so much!! You made her day and mine :)",

Everything was so fresh and delicious we then grabbed a few frozen dinners and a loaf of bread to go! The chicken tenders and frosted cookie were our favorite!! We will definitely be back. Friendly service too. Highly recommend it.",
