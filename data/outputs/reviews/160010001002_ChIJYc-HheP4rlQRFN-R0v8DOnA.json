        "caption": "A Tale of Two Shops: On 2/16/21 I purchased a gift-box at The Chocolat Bar next door with a scarf over my face, but wanted another from City Peanut. At first all was fine, but after answering several questions the shopgirl made a diagnosis that I was a health risk and changed her mind about helping me further. To proceed, a clinical mask was suddenly required and I was called-out in front of another customer as if sores had appeared on what little could be seen of my face. The Chocolat Bar? Happy to sell me chocolates. United Airlines? I flew last week wearing the same face covering. Nut shop? In the middle of a sale she let me quietly walk out, and thanked me for leaving. If the mysophobic, powertripping checkout nurse wasn't interested in my business then I couldn't have cared less about her nutjob explanation. What was adequate for hours of air travel is sufficient for ten minutes in a shop. Along with safety protocols, struggling retailers should also start using common sense and stop pretending to be CDC. Businesses that expect patrons to remain obedient and submissive to the inflexible demands of their employees should also expect to see fewer of them, and more reviews like this. But I hear their biz is booming...it must be nice to be doing so well that they can afford to fire customers. As for the birthday gift that went ungiven, thankfully I had a fabulous box from The Chocolat Bar, but I developed a sudden a bad reaction to nutz. PS: When SCIENCE! boilerplate is given as the excuse then the point has been missed. There is no standardization and each place approaches this differently. Two shops side by side, two totally different experiences and the contrast could not be starker. Are they dropping like flies next door at the Chocolat Bar and is City Peanut suggesting their neighbor acted improperly by accepting my business attired as I was? It's all in the attitude and employees need etiquette training to control their impertinence. If the Nut Shop thinks it's doing a better job than United Airlines at keeping their healthy young workers \"safe\", then along with their positions as public health officials they should also be consulting for the Federal Aviation Administration.",

His shop holds a mouth-watering selection of nuts, candies, popcorn, beers, wines, and ciders along with some awesome Boise inspired goods like cups with etched maps of downtown Boise, pint glasses with bikes and beer on them, and his easily recognizable Peace Idaho t-shirts. If you've never been to City Peanut do yourself a favor and head in! It's welcoming (and always smells AMAZING) and full of fun.",

Staff is great, friendly, answers questions and passionate about their brand.  Highly recommend this PB and can't wait to stop in to visit their little shop! I paid $7 for 16.8oz container, but worth it's weight in gold for deliciousness \ud83d\udc1d. The MAGIC is in their small batch production.  This honey specifically I can say is a little crunchy with a great honey flavor but not overwhelmingly sweet and syrupy.  It's thick and has a great bite with a little salt, it's truly fabulous!",

The  owner also has a simple yet very enjoyable approach to some of the finer aspects of life around Boise, and has an obvious love of his craft.  I cannot recommend this tiny establishment highly enough, imho.  As a visitor from Phoenix,  I would welcome a branch of the business in my neck of the woods.
