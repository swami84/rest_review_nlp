Great choice for those nights when you need an elevated meal that's guaranteed to be delicious.  Very warm and cozy decor. The exposed brick make you really feel at home. The staff is very personable and ultra attentive  on my recent visit. We found ourselves in an engaging conversation that would have continued had we not ended our meal.  On to food. For starters we had a trio of their empanadas. I liked all three. The beef was really well seasoned. The goat and eggplant was different and delicious. Chicken was also delicious. Their cuisine is mainly a fusion of Latin flavors, mainly Brazilian and Argentinian. Heavy on the meat. I always go for the Rib Eye which arrives sizzling in the pan it was cooked in. It tasted just as amazing as it looked. Well cooked at my desired medium level. Juicy and satisfying. I thought their signature mashed yucca was a great accompaniment to the rib eye. My friend enjoyed the skirt steak with saut\u00e9ed kale and rice and beans.  We ended our night by sharing the Tres Leches cake and ordered two frozen margaritas. The cake was nice, well balanced and so spongy. Their margarita were well balanced and strong.  I loved that they provided commendable portions of their food (even during covid). I managed to have 2 individual lunches with my leftovers. Definitely the type of place where you will not have a bad meal. I cannot wait to support them again by rewarding myself with a delicious meal.",

Everything came at once, which on paper sound really good, but the table was cramped. We had to figure out where to place everything with no help.  I suggest sharing food. Portions are fairly sized. Steak is very good. Meat is crispy, which I prefer. Seafood is pretty good too. Would definitely suggest coming with family. Sangria's aren't to shabby either. There is a bar here too. Going on a warm summer day would be good too, as there are seats outside, in the back of the restaurant. Waiters are very caring and are constantly asking how you are doing.  Food suggestions: Steak, sasauge, and chicken portion for 2. Dulce Leche crepes. Brazilian coffee. Seafood ravioli. And much more.  This place definitely should be rated 4.5 stars to 5 stars.",

I couldnt really tell the Argentinian aspect of it but it tasted darn good regardless. First off the empanadas were BOMB, spinach bechamel and goat cheese onion are the two MUST haves. The fried calamari was done well and first time having it with a spicy aiole dip which was amazing. Now moving on to the meats, we had to order the Parrillada and skirt steak with chimichurri. By the way, you can add chimichurri on everything, dont save it for the meats only. All the meats were great but the skirt steak with the chimichurri was tender melt in your mouth irony goodness. I would come back and order two skirt steaks and 4 empanadas with a glass of sangria everyday if I could.  Also the waiter and owner were super friendly.",

Also had a great looking backyard as well so maybe next time.  Drinks orders were taken shortly after we sat.  Waitress was very patient with everyone deciding what they wanted and the recommendations of shared empanada appetizers were great.  The crust was light and flaky and all the different fillings we got were moist and flavorful.  Large amounts of meat and steak for all the entrees, especially the mixed grill (must have).  Constant came by to refill drinks and clear the tables.  We didn't stay for dessert but they sent over 3 plates of flan for the table to share and everyone agreed it was awesome.  The perfect balance of creamy and dense and the caramel was spot on.  Rave reviews from the whole party.  Looking forward to going back.",

Should not be an afterthought. We were practically the only people there on a Thursday night at 8 pm.  In theory this restaurant concept is a good idea, but probably you should order steak.  My dining partner ordered steak and enjoyed it.  I ordered a steak salad and some of the sliced steak was just fat.  The rest of the steak was delicious.  Unfortunately something in the salad was on the verge of going rancid, perhaps the beans. They had a disgusting smell and off taste, but the rest of the salad was good.  The menu needs more detail. The chimmichurri sauce needs to be a little bit more pungent.  They have a nice outside deck, but the mosquitoes were so vicious people were forced inside. Some of the light fixtures obviously haven't been cleaned in years. Basically, give this place a good manager, advertise some drink specials on the sidewalk, and I think it would be packed and making money in no time.",

Oh and did I mention that it was my husband's birthday!!!! So she comes to the table and reluctantly takes our order. Food comes and we eat and when we are done eating,we sit for about 20 minutes and no one comes to clear the table or offer dessert... So I flag down the OTHER waitress and ask for the check. However after biting my tongue and spending $200 I decided to call over who I thought was the owner. I explained to him how unsatisfied I was with the service and he just stood there... No offer of a discount or even a dessert again NOTHING!!! Were we not good enough to be their customers? My daughter who is a food blogger for her college was so taken aback by the absolute lack of hospitality and service especially after growing up in and around the food and beverage industry Sadly our first and last time here..",

If you are reading this search no more cause this is the place for not only any true argentino but for people who want to taste our culture witch is warm embracing and welcoming the owner treated my wife and I like family he is one of those owners who you can tell takes pride in what he does and his restaurant as he should cause it was all great. The restaurant had such a romantic feel that it is way more intimate then anything you can find in Manhattan. I plan on going to new york more often as i fell in love with the city and i swear that every time ill go i will make a stop at EL MATE cause it was a great experience.",

The ambiance, wine, food and incredible staff (Ariel the bartender is knowledgeable about the amazing flavors that will make any pallet happy) makes this place one of my new favorites.  It's a Brazilian and Argentinian fusion that makes the best empanadas, skirt Steak and Yuka mash that I've had ever.  The spices are perfectly blended and will transport you to Brazil or Argentina depending on what you order, with every delicious bite.  To be fair, it's more Argentinian than Brazilian also.  BRAVO El MATE...I like you.",
