It took a while for our food to come out and we even noticed that others that ordered after us had even gotten their food already. I asked for latte to be hot but after getting it, it was room temperature. I don't know if that's what they consider hot instead of iced but I wish it was at least warm. Highly recommend",

I ordered the salmon toast with an iced strawberry guava tea and my total (with 18% tip) came to ~$17. While I suppose that's not a bad price point for the island, coming from the mainland that's quite a premium for a few slices of salmon, bread, cheese, capers, onions, and tea.  Service was speedy, but my companion informed me that that was unusual and that Arvo is most often busier and much more crowded. I certainly believe that as the internal space for Arvo is little more than a single table, an orange juicer, and a main countertop. There is outside seating - roughly five tables of various sizes - as well as an order window.  Arvo shares physical space with a flower shop, which makes for a lovely esthetic. They also incorporate edible flowers in their food, which is a nice, small touch.  So long as you're not looking for a full meal, this is a more than solid option.",

There is richness and deepness and the aftertaste also siccari coffee w Latte art is only hot, not instant, but I made it cold latte. Food was avocado toast and smoked salmon toast. I feel like I was the same last year ^ _ ^; Avocado toast, the topping falls, It may be hard to eat. Toast is delicious. Pre-cut and easy to share. It is regrettable that the opening time is 7:30 even on weekdays, which is a bit late. The sun is rising this time and it is quite hot.

I had the Strawberry, Guava Mint Tea (a must try), and the Matcha Chia Pudding without the whip. Only disappointment was the customer service. The staff barely cracked a smile at us or offered a mere \"hello\" or \"how are you guys doing\" when we walked in. Even when we dropped off our dishes, the people behind the counter just glanced at us, as we said \"thank you\" - not offering a thanks or well-wishes in return. I know this was only one experience, but I highly encourage you guys to work on creating a welcoming and friendly environment! Just a 20-something here, reminding you guys how important personal interactions are and how it is cool to be nice!!!!",

        "caption": "This is a small hipster breakfast/brunch place in Salt Kakaako. You can park in the Salt parking structure or park on the street at the meters (free on weekends). Arvo is located in the same store as Paiko.  Your order at the counter and pay. You can get takeout or they'll give you a number and you can eat at one of the various tables they have outside or the couple of tables they have inside. Their seating is a literally various tables and chairs set up on the sidewalk and on the rocks storefront. They do have a coffee take out window as well. Pets are welcome since most seating is outside.  If you're coming here for your traditional breakfast of eggs and bacon, you'll be disappointed. Their menu basically consists of toasts, savory and sweet toasts ($2-$7.50) and various drinks ($3-$5) that are mostly coffee. I've had their lattes, which are pretty good.  Toast orders come with two pieces on a wooden board. The presentation is absolutely beautiful. I like savory so I haven't tried the sweet toasts. When I come with my boyfriend, we get the loaded avocado toast and smoked salmon toast. We normally split them so we get to each have a salmon and avocado toast.  The loaded avocado has avocado, arugula, tomatoes, and feta cheese. It's a little salty but everything went well together. The smoked salmon has smoked salmon, cream cheese, spinach, red onions and capers. This one is my favorite since I love lox and bagels. It is a bit pricey for what you get to be honest.  Breakfast here is so simple but so good. Can you make the toasts at home? Most definitely. Will it be the same? Probably not.  Besides the toast, they also have a matcha seed pudding with coconut milk, matcha, chia, fresh fruit, matcha whipped cream and coconut flakes. It's a great addition to share if you're on the hungrier side. It's light and creamy with a hint of matcha. This does sell out if you go later.  Please remember to be considerate: put your dishes in the bin by where you order when you're done and please don't linger if you're done when the line of people ordering is long.  Go early. This place can get pretty busy especially on weekends, and seating is limited. It's a great place for a simple breakfast, people watching and feeling hipster.  ********  Arvo is great for some breakfast in Kakaako. It's cute and hipster.",

The chia seed pudding starts with a layer of their matcha chia seeds, then fruits (bananas, strawberries, and pineapples), then topped with their coconut whipped cream. It was yummy--I do recommend this! Wanted to order the toasts, too, but they shut off their machines around 2:30 as they stop serving food at 3... The coffee in all honesty was mediocre at best.

Accept credit cards using Foursquare.  Fresh ingredients, as locally sourced as possible.  Lovely outdoor seating. Very limited indoor seating. Shares a space with the Paiko flower shop. Often a line starting around 10 o'clock, so get there early if you can.  Definitely spring for the loaded avocado toast, the smoked salmon toast, the lavender latte. It might seem pricey for toast, but no, it's not just toast. Food quality is good, shop is clean, and portions of higher-priced items are generous. Expect the full quarter pound or so of very decent quality smoked salmon on your salmon toast. Food is served on wooden planks, so um, those capers? Yeah, they'll roll, so be prepared to lose a few or grab a fork and knife at the front. Edible flowers garnish most dishes. Beautiful presentation, though often very messy. Order inside, get your table marker, grab an outdoor table, and they will bring the food out to you. Grab extra napkins at the front or bring your own small bag of hand wipes. You'll need them.  Cuppa comes with coffee art, but not obnoxious or interferes with the flavor. Matcha latte is very strong here. If you're looking for a watered-down Starbucks version, go there. They do slow cold filtered coffee here that is very very good.",

Basically the food menu i could do at home.  not filling.  so maybe if u need a place to talk to friend ... then doable if u can find a seat.   they do validate.",
