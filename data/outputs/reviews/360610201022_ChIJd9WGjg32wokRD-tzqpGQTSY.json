My first time having catfish and grits, woah, that did NOT disappoint! Phenomenal, the fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The grits were so fluffy, buttery and cheesy!!! The biscuits and gravy appetizer was also a favorite of mine! We also enjoyed the shrimp and grits as well. Loved the added jalape\u00f1os! Also, the Mac and cheese was just OK!Slightly disappointed, was expecting a different taste since it was a 7 cheese Mac! But all in all, I loved my meal!",

With that being said we must rise to the occasion and get everything in check. In a time of covid water glasses should not be left upside on the table. A stronger solution needs to be put in the washing machine because glasses have marks and appear embarrassingly dirty. The side plates were dusty and we were given one fork and one knife to tackle multiple different dishes. One being Mac and cheese with no spoon served. The server was good but service was definitely spotty. The drinks were delicious and priced appropriately. The food however was so underwhelming, specifically the soupy Mac and cheese, I needed to triple check to see if they were actually the recipients of best food award by the food network. The price point did not match food but it *is* covid - restaurants are getting by how they see fit.  The pancakes were good, plain. The ambience was fun. They had biggie and an array of 90s throwbacks. If they can get their cleanliness under check and their food back to where it needs to be, I would frequent again.",

It also came with a biscuit - try it with the sugar cane butter. We also had the carafe of the Moonshine punch\ud83d\ude1c...it's good but it sneaks up on you.

He didn't act as though he was interested in answering my wife's questions about side dishes. When the food arrived, the bacon was not fully cooked. Fortunately, the owner/chef was willing to take it back to be cooked more thoroughly. He was very friendly and was joking with my wife. The food was enjoyable after getting the bacon back. The waiter however was very abrupt as he gave me the change from my bill, almost allowing it to be taken by the wind. He would have received a better tip, had he acted like his employer.",

The ambience is great and there is always a lively crowd and great music. The food is elevated southern. The food was just okay. I had the steak and eggs. The eggs were very good, but the steak was so fatty, just a very poor quality cut of meat. My friend had the catfish. She said it was very salty and she didn't enjoy it. My other friend had the burger which he loved. The drinks were pretty good and I love the venue. The service could use some improvement. It may be just a result of covid19, but there was only 1 waiter for the entire outdoor section. The waiter took our order and I never saw him again until I flagged him down to pay.",

We had 9pm reservations and arrived at approximately 8:30 for drinks. One of the ladies in our party went to bar to order a drink and waited close to 45 minutes for the bartender to take her order. We were seated around 9:30. Our hostess was pleasant, and our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. As we were placing our orders, we learned that the restaurant was out of the following items: Rib eye steak Ribs Pulled pork Watermelon mojito Lobster bisque Southern comfort ice cream Vanilla ice cream Loaded baked potato No desserts except the apple cobbler  The pork chops were extremely salty, as was the potato salad.  However the fried chicken, shrimp & grits and the biscuits were very good. The great music helped to ease the disappointment.  We asked to speak with the manager/owner and communicated our concerns at which time she expressed her complete agreement and dissatisfaction. She heard us without contest, but our overall visit left a stain on our perception of BLVD Bistro.",

I'm not sure if the food was subpar because perhaps the chef was not in on this particular night, or if this is typical of the new location. Mistakes were made with our dinner order, but it wasn't a big deal, as the friendly staff quickly corrected it. We ordered chocolate cake and received apple pie. The waiter corrected his error, and brought us chocolate cake which was cut in sloppily and tasted quite stale and old. We immediately sent it back. The waiter tried to offer other dessert, but we were absolutely not interested. The staff were nice, but seemed very new and somewhat lackadaisical. The decor was nice. Overall, not the Birthday dinner I was expecting.",

We had to ask for items several times or they would be forgotten, due to the number of people but were they were apologetic about it. I think had we been sitting indoors it would have frustrated me but I was in good spirits, the sun was shining and the food was scrumptious.  ****** Update: it\u2019s 2 years later and this place is still to die for. The place is much bigger now, so the it\u2019s lively and more spacious. And the food. Well Still my go to in NYC every tine I visit from London. Go hungry and share everything.

I was visiting a friend  who lives in Harlem and has been to the original location  (she prefers the vibe of the original better but said space is ample here). I originally had the egg dish but sent it back when my eggs were overcooked and my potatoes were not crispy as requested.  I had the blueberry pancakes instead.  AMAZING! I can't stop thinking about them. To top it off, I observed the owner/chef walk out and make his rounds around the entire restaurant greeting people.  I love that kind of service.  All of the staff were pleasant and efficient.  I will  be back.  (My friend says the food is also great for dinner!)",

It was strange, restaurant not too crowded (Wednesday) but everything just took toooo long. We sat by the bar in those upright seats. Again, the server, overly chatty- the \"I'll take care of you guy,\" but just wasn't as attentive as needed. The catfish was tremendous, but the night was just...off for the reasons given.

Once inside they tried to squeeze our party of 11 into a space made for 8 people; using small tables made for two people at each table. They put 4 place Settings at each table; I guess I was expected to pay my money and eat in my lap. No one came address this ridiculous expectation.

Upon entering i went into the bathroom and this is where my disappointment began. The bathroom was very unappealing and lacked any cleanliness. Returning to my seat the wait staff had a very loud and unprofessional conversation over my shoulder. Also to my surprise the wait staff was on their phones, headphones in their ear and continued to have unprofessional conversations. One member in particular left the kitchen on several occasions and i noticed that his behind was out (literally i saw cheeks)  Furthermore what i believe to be a staple of a visit( the basket with butter, jam, and hot sauce ) was never given to my table but was given to the surrounding guests. After deciding to continue my guest and I noticed a very foul smell. Trying to end on a positive note the food was not bad. I feel like the cheese could have been melted more and the biscuits were enhanced once i asked for the jam.",

The special fish had no flavor and seems it was saut\u00e9ed and thrown on a plate. And the blvd burger. The burger was juicy but tasteless. The only thing that saved it was the sauce of it.

We both decided to stay based on the pictures from Google and Instagram. I'm so glad we stayed! The service was great. The food was amazing. The vibe inside was great. The owner served us and he was very welcoming and personable, he also took his time sharing the specials and drinks of the day. The wait time for the food was not long at all, which I appreciated bc I had a flight to catch. I had the biscuit sandwich with fried chicken, scrambled eggs, and cheddar cheese. I also had the cheese grits. I can still taste the grits lol. They were so freaking good. I thought I loved Chick Fil A's chicken biscuit, but this biscuit topped that. The biscuit had the right amount butter and fluffiness and the GRITS, WHEW! I'll definitely be going back every time I'm in NYC. I also like supporting small businesses!! I would definitely recommend for a quick lunch date, dinner date, or day out with your girls/guys.",

Since I go to church up the block from here, and live in the area, I decided to go on an early lunch date, and waited for this establishment to open. Once we walked in, the air was  smoky, and had a heavy aroma of something burnt. We should have left, but decided to stay. The kitchen staff must have burnt something because the smell never left the whole time we were there. They opened up the door to eliminate the smell, but that just made it cold inside. On the menu, they didn't have any of the following available; Shrimp, Catfish, French Toast, or BlueBerry Pancakes. The half and half wasn't very good. The Macaroni and Cheese was burnt on the top. I wonder if that is what the staff was burning in the back. Lobster Bisque is my favorite soup, so since it was the soup of the day, I had to try it. That wasn't bad, came out steaming hot. The chicken, potatoe salad, and collard greens were all very good, but the burnt smell aroma took away from my enjoyment of it. Overall, I was disapointed. I am pretty sure the food is good on any other day, but they  were definitely off their game today.",

We shared both entrees and it was all two thumbs... Delicious!  If only we had more time in NY, we would have definitely come back.  We were staying on W 136th - which isn't far.  We walked over.  But we spent a lot of time in the city/sight seeing, etc.  Otherwise, I'm more than sure we would have returned.  I hope to return to NY one day and this will definitely be on the list to dine again!  Oh, the staff was extremely friendly and there seems to be a lot of team work that goes on there.

I can\u2019t eat this it\u2019s burnt.  He apologized and brought out more catfish that was soft and full of grease.  It was obvious to the waitress it had to be bad cause she asked did you all not like it?   Two entree\u2019s for 82 dollars left on table and the waitress claimed she was going to talk to whomever.... well nothing was taken off.   Maybe bad day for the cook or to crowded for asunday brunch .",

His wife was the one seating people and greeting them. It definitely felt like a family business.  The waitress and waiters were perfect. They didn't focus on checking on just on their tables they went to every table to make sure everyone was comfortable and happy.  I didnt get to take a picture of my food because I couldnt wait to eat haha but I had a homemade biscuit with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, and turkey bacon. They also put jelly on the side just in case I wanted to add.  I have nothing bad to say. I am going back soon so I can show my mother how great this restaurant is.",

Warm, attentive and welcoming staff. Enjoyed the catfish, collard greens and apple cobbler dessert. Wasn't crazy about ingredients and size of potatoes in the potatoe salad, could've been cut smaller; reminded me of my aunt's recipe but it was ok. Sangria was mouth watering. I definitely plan to return and highly recommend it!!",
