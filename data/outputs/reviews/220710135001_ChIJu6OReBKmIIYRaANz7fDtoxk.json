We finally decide to leave because we're just standing in the doorway and we feel like we're not going to get decent service due to whatever attitude the staff currently has. As soon as we start to walk out the door we hear \"ohhh nooOoo0\" in the most condescending tone then and only then were we even asked if we had a reservation. We didn't but that certainly could have been asked 10 minutes prior.

Staff were professional and accommodating. I actually have nothing negative to say about the restaurant. It was quiet, had that fancy but not snobby rough brick, dimly lit interior and *felt* expensive despite its moderate prices. I really enjoyed that they had bar space, dining space, and a deceptively large outdoor space. It just wasn't... special? There was no mood in the place. No firm culture. It felt like a run of the mill joint. I enjoyed it but it was missing something I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe it was the lack of energy that I expected to see and didn't from the customers. No complaints though, not real ones anyway. Enjoy your time there!",

Nous nous sommes assis au bar pour siroter quelques Moscow Mule et nous \u00e9tions d\u00e9\u00e7us de n\u2019avoir aucune r\u00e9servation pour rester manger! Les assiettes avaient d\u2019l\u2019air app\u00e9tissantes! Une prochaine fois assur\u00e9e!",

They have a good happy hour from 3-6 with drink specials and snacks/small plates. We had the catfish tacos and the nachos (which were awesome!). The nachos were on Zapp\u2019s chips instead of tortilla chips, with cheese sauce, pulled pork bbq, jalape\u00f1os, etc. YUMMY!! I recommend checking them out!!",

First, a no point did the event manager tell me that seating would be outside.  It's HOT in August.  If I had known it was outside, I would have made reservations elsewhere.  Where would we have been seated if it had rained?!  Secondly, it took almost hour just to get water.  Third, the server spilled hot gumbo on one of my guests and didn't even apologize.  Fourth, I ate my appetizer but had to cancel my meal because I was so overheated.  Fifth, at the two-hour mark, many of our guests still hadn't been served and most of the food that had been served was cold - they also brought food to the table that wasn't even ordered.  It was a total train wreck.  Luckily, some people in my party spoke with management and they took care of it (thank you for that).  The few people who were served hot food did say the food was very good so that's the reason for anything other than one star.  As I was leaving, someone did apologize to me directly and I appreciated that.  She was very kind.  Some of my guests drove over 500 miles to get there and I was more sad than mad at the situation.  A word of advice: If you aren't able to comfortably and efficiently accommodate the number of customers who are requesting service, please be honest and convey that. There is no absolutely shame in turning someone away if the venue isn't large enough to host that many people.",

My husband decided on the Acadia crawfish and grits and I got the Pasta Evangeline which was sooo good both were extremely rich but that made me like it even more. Dessert was Banana Foster need I say more. The server was helpful and on top of it. This is a new favorite spot for my husband and I.",

Evangeline has a warm, intimate atmosphere \u2013 the bar is beautiful.and staff is welcoming and friendly.  My husband said the crawfish etoufee was the best he\u2019s ever had!  My cousin from CA tried her first fried okra with remoulade and loved it.  The food is awesome - everything home made - and the bartender knows his business - I ordered a French 75, my cousin opted for the rum punch and my husband a local beer.  So good we ordered 2 of them!  Our server was ASA!   He was fabulous.  So much fun and friendly, yet highly professional.  He surprised us with festive New Orleans necklaces and even took me outside to give me directions.  He made our experience so much fun.   We loved Evangeline.  You should go!",

The place itself is low key during the day, but I imagine it is far more spirited during the evening, what with a name such as Evangeline. I will hopefully be back during my trip to to try the Crabcakes Benedict (Which, I have no doubt, are also delicious). In a city full of restaurants, Evangeline's is a jewel.",

We ordered the gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and fried okra, and topped it all off with the bread pudding beignets. The food was piping hot, perfectly flavorful, and really hit the spot. We couldn\u2019t stop taking turns telling each other how happy we were. Hands down the best place for real creole/Cajun food and friendly service. Will absolutely be back before our trip is over.",

It was too cold to sit out there when I went, but I imagine on a nice day it is simply lovely.  Well there, there was some live music, and while we sat basically right next to the bassist and pianist, they continued to check and make sure they were not playing too loudly for us to hold conversation. They were very considerate. The music was not annoyingly fast, but rather reminded me of a very cool hip jazz club. Again there were only two instruments in the group, so that probably helped.  The food was exceptional. I really really enjoyed each and every bite of each meal I tried... I only had the meal pictured, but I tried to others and they were incredible. Dessert was also on point. I only had a draft beer, so I cannot attest to their mixed beverages, but the bar seemed well stocked and well manned. Our waitress (Denise) was very attentive and made wonderful serving suggestions.  The portions were just right to fill you up but not make you feel bloated. We ended up feeling a little bloated because we could not resist trying an appetizer (fried alligator... Very tasty) and a dessert (Bread pudding... Also very tasty)! But even then, it wasn't uncomfortably full...  The prices were very reasonable... It was about $40 per person (before tip) . That included three adult males sharing an appetizer, each person having a main course, sharing a dessert and two adult beverages/one iced tea.  I had no idea that this restaurant was on some stupid Food Network Channel show, but that would not have caused me to go here in the first place. Look at the photos of their food!  I am glad that we tried this place and I am absolutely certain to return on a future visit to New Orleans.",

The waitstaff were attentive and quick and let us know happy hour was going on so $3 for a selection of draft beers was awesome. We ordered the blackened fish tacos to start and they were pretty big so that was a nice surprise. During happy hour the tacos were $6 for two. Myself and my husband ordered the gator creole style which had a bit of a peppery kick to it and was delicious. I ordered the Acadia crawfish grits and it was to die for. The sauce was perfect and they don\u2019t skimp out on the crawfish.  I highly recommend coming here as the food is unique and delicious. Try the crawfish grits as that\u2019s their main speciality!",

I was then asked to switch to a different table because apparently they were expecting a group to come and the space was needed: ok, no problem. They had run out of jambalaya so I ordered red beans and rice. The portion was appropriate and everything tasted fine. I finished my meal, paid, and the group still had not arrived to sit at the first table.  After eating, I had some indigestion...which was surprising to me, since it was flavorful but not spicy and unfried.  I hope that they had not served me something that was going bad ... Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, and likely wouldn't recommend to friends or family with so many other solid options in town.",

Our group shared some apps, okra, crab cakes and tacos. I loved the crab cakes and wanted to order more for myself. Good thing I didn't because the entree was amazing.  I ordered the jambalaya. Spice level was good for a good kick that just lingers in your mouth and the seafood was fresh. The rest of my group was happy with their meals as well. One of my coworker ordered their dish that was featured on the Food Network and enjoyed it a lot.  This is definitely a place I'll eat at again if I'm visiting New Orleans.",

The server was so friendly and told us some fun facts about the bar, it used to be a horse barn for the fire station, and answered all of our menu questions with a smile and his personal reviews of the items. It was the best place we ate the whole time we were in town! I highly recommend it!! I can't wait to go back!! Great food, friendly staff, and an fun, cozy, local-feeling environment.",
