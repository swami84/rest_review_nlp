The burgers and things was like a comic kid style burger shop but this burgers on bishop is like the grown up kid gourmet version \u2661 A hidden gem in the heart of downtown located across from aloha tower and the end of fort street mall off of Nimitz and bishop st. Free validated parking. During the day you can order from the menu and pay first to take your food to go or stay and eat in a lovely ambiance the owner created. White tablecloths and real silverware  and white napkins. She has the most amazing staff and sweet ladies with lots of aloha. The first time I went to this location, burgers on bishop, with a friend and had the most amazing yogurt parfait with lots of fruit and lovely cherries with granola and Greek yogurt.  My friend had these garlic truffle fries which were so onolicious and I couldn't stop stealing them! They're not cut the typical way. It's like a curly fry but not cut that way either. So, you have to come and try them yourself because you can't stop at just one! They have 3 choices to choose from! So, last night I told my husband and son that we are going to dinner here and checking out the new Pau hana menu and live entertainment. They're both loving their great burgers and they were concerned. As we walk up to the location at the topa building they didn't think much about it. Then we turned to the right and we see dimmed lights, candles on the tables, white tablecloths, groups of people having fun and live music with a saxophone player! We were greeted by the owner and I introduced her to my ohana and we sat down and then another lady comes over to greet us and as my husband said, \"the most kind and sweetest ladies that make it work and so funny too. Those ladies make it work!\" I ordered the garlic lemon butter  king crab and they cut the shells for me which is fantastic,  my hubby ordered the prime rib and son, who is 10, orders the wagyu burger medium rare.  Now, this is so sweet that to accommodate my son, it is not on the Pau hana menu but does this as a courtesy.  We are so happy because everyone who is a parent knows that if you promise your kids something and it doesn't happen, It is gonna be miserable.  The owner has kids and went above and beyond! She brings over a puzzle game similar to the rubik's cube to keep him busy. My son gives it 5 stars, being the food conneseiur, which he thought this was an insult but actually a compliment, that he is and we have to concur with his deductive reasoning. I couldn't stop stealing his fries and dip it in my crab lemon butter sauce and drippings from his wagyu burger! Super onolicious \u2661 We cleaned our plates! She brought us back to the kitchen with our son's clean plate and he thanked the chef!!! The chef had a huge smile on his face! Its byob too. So bring your bottles and enjoy gourmet food and live music only on Friday's!!! The food was over the top amazing flavors and the quality was absolutely fantastic! A great evening that was so fancy! A  surprisingly unexpected gourmet meal\u2661 On the car ride home,  my husband said how he tipped 25 percent because he thought those ladies and chef went absolutely above and beyond and the ladies were  fantastic and he wouldn't mind going back again! Please check it out for yourselves and get cookies, campfire and or peanut butter,  and or ice cream, cake, cheesecake for dessert too\u2661 Open Monday to Thursday 8am to 3pn. And fridays are special from 8am to 8pm!",

I got my order to go and they packaged it all separately which is nice so that when I ended up eating it the bread wasn\u2019t mushy from the juices.  The truffle fries were pretty good lacked a little bit of the truffle but good nonetheless.  Good spot for a quick burger!",
