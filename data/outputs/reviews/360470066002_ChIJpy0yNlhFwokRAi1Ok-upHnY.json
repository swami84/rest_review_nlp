Everything was bursting with flavor and prepared to perfection.  We started off with a fresh, crisp salad, followed by a trio of dips and blue corn tortilla chips.   The guacamole and the hummus were really good and super packed with flavor.  The salsa was terrific as well.  We sampled a few wraps, The El Mexicano,  the Chicken Lovers, and the Cesar.  All were absolutely delicious!!!!  Next came out three delicious entrees. Chicken Kabobs, skewered  pieces of super moist chicken, with onion, tomato and green bell pepper.  Brushed with a light sweet glaze, they were very good.  The Taste of China rice bowl was a mixture of chicken, beef and broccoli and prepared with a brown Asian sauce.  The flavors were sooooooo good!  Next was a teriyaki rice bowl.  Brown rice and bison mixed up with assorted veggies in a teriyaki sauce.   Everything complimented each other nicely.  For dessert we had an assortment of cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake and carrot cake.    All three were sugar free and if you didn\u2019t know you would\u2019ve have known.  The owners and staff could not have been any nicer   Service was very accommodating  They even made special dishes for the vegetarian and vegan guests.  Overall it was a great meal and I\u2019m looking forward to getting back there very soon.",

Something for everyone and most importantly its all savory and juicy full of flavor hitting the taste buds. Dont get me started on their muffins, hands down the best i ever tried so far.  Anyone interested in healthy and tasty food ....this is a must stop.  Only con is that delivery take about 60-90 minutes and when i order chicken its cold by the time it comes.  So i started to order a salad with chicken =] now it makes sense.  I wish they had this place near my residence so i can order from them at home also.",

        "caption": "Once upon a time, I found a menu for this place on the floor, tucked behind the refrigerator, of the place I moved into. I didn't read any reviews, I just held onto the menu. One day, I was walking in the area and stumbled upon this place. It looked so peaceful from the outside. It was meant to be!  When I opened the door, the loud voices from customers, tv and music spilled out. I found myself staring at a hallway with a kitchen at the other end. This place is SMALL and had a full house! The amount of orders being placed over the phone for delivery, blew my mind. This place is BUSY, BUSY, BUSY! The staff behind the counter is very kind and considerate, even during the rush.  The food was surprisingly delicious and the portions are a good size. The smoothies are delightfully fresh. There is a sign that tells you that \"Fast food is not good and good food is not fast.\" So expect to wait while your yummy food is prepared. Also, make note that good food is not cheap! I paid $15 for a smoothie and chicken wrap. (This is the price I usually pay for my lunch on the Upper Eastside of Manhattan). I feel this is a little pricey for Brooklyn, but I will pay it (and so will you) because it's fresh...and delicious!",
