I ordered smashed potatoes ($ 10) and bone-in cowboy ribeye ($ 62 + tax and tip) while for sweet brownie with ice cream (around $ 10). The meat I asked for medium-rare but in many places it literally got charred. The quality then left a lot to be desired with several nerves. The normal brownie. Clarification: if the restaurant aims to be a steakhouse (so at least says the name of the restaurant) why do I find a prevalence of fish and pasta on the menu? The same appetizers are practically all based on fish and it is not clear how you can first order a fish appetizer and then a nice steak. Findings far below expectations given the price.  (Original) Premetto che le aspettative erano alte viste le recensioni. Ho ordinato smashed potatoes (10$)  e bone-in cowboy ribeye (62 $ + tasse e mancia) mentre per dolce brownie con gelato (sui 10$). La carne l'avevo chiesto medium-rare ma in moltinpunti \u00e8 arrivata letteralmente carbonizzata. La qualit\u00e0 poi lasciava molto a desiderare con parecchi nervi. Il brownie normale. Precisazione: se il ristorante punta ad essere una steakhouse (cos\u00ec almeno dice il nome stesso del locale) perch\u00e9 nel men\u00f9 trovo una prevalenza di pesce e di pasta? Gli stessi antipasti sono praticamente tutti a base di pesce e non si capisce come si possa prima ordinare un antipasto a base di pesce e poi una bella bistecca. Giudizio ben al di sotto delle aspettative visto il prezzo.",

The filet mignon was ordered medium rare, and the steaks were perfectly charred on the outside and a perfect temp on the inside. Overall, the experience was outstanding from the amazing food and wine, to the exceptional service.

This restaurant has a great neighborhood feel to it, despite being right in lower Manhattan.  We started out with the scallops and spinach appetizer, which was fantastic, if slightly on the small side (something Mike helpfully mentioned, before we even considered asking). The seasoning and sear on the scallops was superb, and shows a chef with great control of their cook surfaces.  My first clue that this place was special came when I ordered my steak rare, and they asked me how rare I wanted it. What's even better is that the resulting steak was a perfect match to my request.  The steak was perfect. Flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender, with a nice thin sear line. I have had a lot of good steaks, but this was easily the best meal of my life.  The house steak sauce is a sweet variant, that seems like it would make an excellent glaze for chicken, but using it on a steak this good would be blasphemous. They should license it to more mediocre steakhouses.  The overall atmosphere, service, and food easily justified the check at the end. We spent around 3 hours in the restaurant, split a nice bottle of wine, and had a very thorough dinner for two, with leftovers, and spent $250, including tip.  Normally I would be shocked by that amount, but instead, I'm thinking of going back this Friday for seconds.",

It was a little far from the Fulton subway (10-15 mins) but it was definitely worth it!!  Made a reservation earlier that day and was shown to our table very promptly upon arrival. We had a cosy corner and was served by a brilliant friendly waiter (sorry I didn\u2019t catch his name but he wore glasses, was quite tall and imlooks middle-aged). He was very professional the whole night, he recommended to pair our fillet mignons with the hash potatoes and asparagus and omg, the potatoes were heavenly!! He even described the sizes of the mignons perfectly. The fillets were cooked nicely too, although the MR for my husband could have been a tad more cooked but we finished everything, had to pack the potatoes as they were a big portion. Do note that the 16oz is quite huge!!  Had a pistachio ice cream for dessert since we were stuffed and that was absolutely delicious too. In all honesty, the quality of the food, service and overall ambience of the place justified the price and we were extremely satisfied.  We will be back here whenever we visit NYC again! Highly recommended :)",

I felt embarrassed. The service was second to none. I now need to find another steakhouse that can cook a steak as requested. A month went by and no response to my review. I will not be going back to this establishment with my family or my friends. Went to another steakhouse with my friends the other day. The steak was cooked as requested and it was one third the price and it was delicious. The service was not as good but satisfactory. The important thing was the steak was cooked as requested. No response from the owner at all. He or she should respond to all the reviews regardless if it's good or bad. Honestly, I was hoping for an apology for the incorrect way my steak was cooked. Oh well, I guess they have more important things to do than respond to a customers negative review. Been going there for years with my friends. Never again.",

I lived at 10 Hanover square Several years ago after moving from mid town and My Wife and I stumbled upon this gem by accident. It was superb. Our waiter was Marty and he made the experience exceptional. The Bscon appetizer is to die for and the steak is absolutely fantastic. We always get the porter house for two with the amazing seafood tower. The staff always makes you feel at home and we have seen so many repeat customers who are always thrilled to be here as well. If you have tried the other steak houses in the city like Bobby Van\u2019s and Wolfgang\u2019s you will taste the superior difference immediately. The Owner Ray always comes out to say Hello And he really wants you to have a beyond excellent experience. So go here and see for yourself how a truly amazing steak House should be",

Much to our chagrin the area at pier 17 was closed for remodeling and construction.  Asked a few of the locals for a place and consulted Google maps and found a place that we wasn't really what we were looking for.  The waitress there recommended Mark Joseph's and after going down a block too far and getting new directions we found it.  I immediately thought it was like something you see in a NYC movie.  The service from our waiter was amazing and the food was equally as good.  Our appetizers were all amazing, steaks perfectly cooked, and the sea bass was equally as tasty.  Had the Mark Joseph special for dessert....awesome.  Wish they would've maybe had a local small brew beer available but the Sam Adams Summer Ale was really good.  If you live in the area and haven't tried it you're missing out and if you are visiting look them up.",
