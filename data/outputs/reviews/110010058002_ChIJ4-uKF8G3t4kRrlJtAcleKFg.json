The yum num, beef salad with lime, is awesome. Exactly what I expected. Red curry us so good. We'll be returning often. Only bad thing I can say is I ordered the beef with my curry and they gave me chicken, but it was still delicious. Hope y'all support this establishment. You won't regret it.",

So you get rice bowls with a variety of toppings, naan pizza and the like. The concept of Indian bowls seems to have taken off well going by the popularity of the place, though the majority of the patrons were Indian. They took an extraordinary long time to serve the dishes other than the bowls. I wasn't very pleased with the texture of the uttapam and the batter had also gone a little sour. But the samosa was very crisp and made well. Overall I'd say a decent place for Indian food in the downtown DC area.",

        "caption": "We were full of expectation when we visited Spice 6. The ambiance is good for a fast casual restaurant (think Chipotle for Indian foods). Being vegetarian is sometimes tough as the choices at restaurants are immediately limited. However, the menu did not disappoint.  We were 3 people so we ordered 3 different dishes and tried it. First up, vegetarian naan pizza. Paneer+onion+bellpepper+jalapeneo+cheese. It was awesome to taste - except for couple things. Salt was a bit on the low side (yes it is subjective) and spices were Americanized (again subjective). Some people may like it, some may not. We landed more towards the like column but wished for more salt/spices.  Next up was Rava Onion Masala Dosa. The dosa itself was good but the Sambhar was extremely spicy (Naan Pizza not that spicy but Sambhar extremely spicy???). Both the chutneys supplied had extra salt. Essentially, the consistency was lacking but the taste was great.  Third dish was Chili Paneer Dosa. This dish, at best, was barely decent. The dosa had very little amount of oil. The chili paneer did not seem crispy (as a lot of chili paneers are) and again, the chutneys were salty and sambhar extremely spicy.  We also ordered Mango Lassi. This seemed more like Mango Milkshake than Mango Lassi. The thickness was off and the taste made it feel like it was *not* made from yogurt.  So the overall question: Would I recommend this restaurant. Yes, I would. I loved the concept. I loved the food. I loved the ambiance. I just did not like the inconsistencies in spice levels. Hope they make the spiciness more consistent.",

It's a welcome addition to the fast casual dining scene in DC and offers a more unique set of flavors that are sorely lacking here.  I ordered the salad with the spicy chicken and the regular chicken. I got the tandoori sauce and some other kind of sauce.  The portions are large, the price is fair and the service is friendly! I also noticed this place was very clean. Whether that is a result of this place just opening up or not is still TBD, but I am really looking forward to coming back here soon.",

However it\u2019s downtown DC and it\u2019s inexpensive, quick, clean and fresh! I\u2019ll take it! The tomato chutney was too spicy for me. The sambar was also a bit spicier than I expected but the coconut chutney was on point. Mango lassi is pre-sweetened so I had to miss out. They do serve kulfi and Punjabi food as well. Now all I need is some chaat and Indo-Chinese and i am set. It\u2019s a good place to try for quick and traditional South Indian food. I gave 4 out of 5 only because the spice level was too much.",

The branch was located at the back of theatre , there wasn't a rush even though it was a Saturday night but the ambience was great with different ethnicities coming in to have Indian type cusine.  Their menu was very creative and I got to see this type of menu in NY too , its a fusion based with Indian cuisines mixed with Italian, Mexican, American etc.  We tried these for the first time : 1)Naan pizza (5/5):  I absolutely loved it for the effort put in , the naan is soft having a thick crust while we get to choose toppings , I Chose paneer cubes and kadia paneer as the sauce for the base. Toppings are mainstream but the finish was lovely. An Italian-indian fusion was amazing as cheese with kadia sauce tasted amazing. The pizza was filling enough for even 2 people and it was quite evident being a fan favourite for the people.  2)Naan wrap (1/5):  Burrito type , It was one regretfull decision we made as it wasnt the greatest fusion cuisine in the menu. The ingredients for the wrap did not go well with the wrap, naan being thick wasn't the best option for a wrap as it was hard to eat and the stuffings came out regularly. I wouldnt suggest this for a good dinner.  3)Raava dosa (4/5):  We had to order something as we couldnt complete the naan wrap, as desired the dosa was soft and given with chutney and sambar, it was good enough and an amazing choice if you're not interested in the fusion menu.",

I love going to the one in Mosaic location, and was very excited that another location opened up in DC that also serves dosas! I waited until my wedding was over to try it out, because I knew I would be hooked!  I've come here 1/2 a dozen times and delightfully my way through the entire menu! I'll dish out my favorites: naan pizza with kadhia sauce, biryani rice bowl, paneer kebab, and rava masala dosa. The food is bursting with flavor in every bite. Even the tofu is delicious! The portion sizes are quite generous and feel stuffed after eating 1/2 of an entree, it's so hard not resist devouring all of it!  Here's the scoop on all of the dishes:  - Garlic Naan: Worth the $1 extra that elevates the flavor - Naan wrap: Tasty but really messy to eat as the sauce drips out of it. I recommend not getting it with a sauce or better yet...get the pizza! - Naan pizza: My favorite dish especially with the kadhai sauce. So tasty that i couldn't stop until I ate all of the slices! - Biryani: Skip the brown and white rice. I'm not a big rice fan, but really enjoyed the bold flavor of the spices in the biryani. - Rice bowl: Great carry-out option that's the least messiest to eat. Get the biryani with paneer and tofu! - Kebab Entree: Great option if you can't decide what, it's a nice sampler! The paneer kebab is really tasty with larger chunks and different marinade sauce than the panner served at the front. I would skip the paneer/veggie combo and just get the paneer. Although the container is sealed tight, I don't think it's the best take-out option and would sit down and eat it. - Sauces: The kadhai sauce is my favorite! The palak sauce is good, the tikki sauce is bit spicy, I wasn't a fan of the korma sauce. - Paneer: Cooked well and marinated in a nice savory sauce - Tofu: Surprisingly very good! I LOVE paneer, but so impressed with the tofu that I sometimes get it. - Veggies: Spicy! - Choola: Chickpeas cooked well with good sauce. Recommend the choola over the veggies. - Mixed chat: Nice appetizer, filling enough to be a light lunch with mini samosa and small aloo potato tikki/patty. - Rava Dosa: Very good, Rava dosa is tough to make right, it's a testament on how good a restaurant can make its dosas. The sambar is quite tasty as well with a nice spicy kick. - Palak Paneer Entree: Made fresh from the back and much thicker than the Palak sauce served at the front - Onion Uttapam: The only dish I wasn't a fan of, too doughy and undercooked, I wish it was thinner and crispier. That's probably the only item on the menu that I wouldn't get again. The Veggie Uttampam at the table next to me looked very good though.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Even though lunch time is quite busy, they are polite and take your order with a smile.  Although I'm impressed by the extensive menu, it's a bit hard to read. Rotating screens and more pictures would help! My only complaint about the food is that the sauces are a bit runny and I wish they were thicker.  Overall, I LOVE Spice 6 and come here at least once/week with my coworkers. Great places for groups and picky eaters, definitely a crowd-pleaser with so many choices and customization. Always excited to come back!",

I may be remembering it wrong or my palate has evolved, but I left disappointed in the Spice 6 location in Chinatown. Here's why:  1) Space: It's an odd space. It clearly belonged to another restaurant and they quickly threw some Spice 6 design on it leaving a disconnected design that doesn't scream Spice 6.  2) Food: It's average. I ordered the chicken tikka wrap. It was a healthy portion and fine, but not the best Indian I've had in DC (for that go to Navy Yard to Rasa).
