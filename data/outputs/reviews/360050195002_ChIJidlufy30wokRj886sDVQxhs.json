        "caption": "I've been hearing good things about this place for years since when it was known as Feeding Tree. Either it was heavily hyped or things changed quite a bit. I came hungry one evening with my fianc\u00e9 (who happens to be West Indian) and was excited to get what I thought would be some good jerk chicken.  The first clue that something wasn't right should have been when my order came to $28 for a large order of jerk chicken and two cans of Diet Coke. When the cashier told me the cost, I must have seemed stunned, and asked, \"How much??\" I shouldn't have paid and should have just cancelled the order, but by then I was starving. The cashier explained that they charged per pound ($12/lb.) and it was 2 lbs.  Already feeling cheated, I came to discover that the \"jerk\" chicken was...barbecued, burnt chicken with sauce that they passed off as jerk that we figured out was likely a mixture of ketchup, vinegar, and pepper. I've had good jerk, great jerk even, and I've also had much better chicken for much less.  After finishing my $28 meal, I not only felt cheated, but I felt angry. If you haven't had the pleasure of having eaten good jerk chicken or pork, you can do so and a large order should cost you around $14, nearly half as much as this mediocre meal. Some places try to cut corners by purposefully burning the chicken and pouring cheap hot sauce over it, then passing it off as \"jerk.\"  Verdict: if I want good jerk, I'll go to Gun Hill or Flatbush Ave. or eat my friend's amazing jerk pork. Eating Tree is trash food by people who try to rip you off.  Bonus: one of the employees chased this guy outside to yell at him because of the trash he left on the table. One problem: he didn't leave the trash there and it was there way before him. So not only are they con artists with bad food, they also have no customer service.",

Last time I ordered the jerk chicken lunch special with rice and peas and they threw in a free piece of corn bread. Im not used to that at caribbean restaurants but it was a good combo with my food. The ginger fruit punch is absolutely tasty! My girlfriend and I shared one and finished it in about 2 minutes. We went back for a refill before leaving the street the restaurant is on haha.  Some things I'm not too fond of are the small patties. They are really delicious but I finish them in about 5 bites so I would like if they made them bigger especially for the $2.25 price tag. Whenever I go here, the meat sections look empty and it throws me off, but they get so much business that the food is constantly getting depleted. Lastly, when you order a size up, you're supposed to get more of everything, but they gave me 3 pieces of meat with the lunch special and the medium...  Other than that, this spot is the go to for a delicious Caribbean meal.",

I came here because I went to a Yankee game, and didn't feel like paying $10 for a $4 hamburger.  I got medium-sized order of jerk chicken, and it took awhile to get anything although I saw the kitchen working, so it was obviously made fresh.  I got a fair size container stuffed with food, including rice and beans, some veggies, and also some cornbread on the side.  However, they gave me oxtails.  Now I'm not an expert on Jamaican food, but I can tell an oxtail from a piece of  chicken.  I wanted something spicy, so I gave it back--but not after trying a bite.  It was really tender and flavorful, but again just not what I order.  I dug into my chicken as soon as I got it, as I was running a bit late at this point.  I got a few breast pieces as well as a wing.  It could've been a bit more spicy, but it was juicy and very flavorful.  The veggies were a perfect complement, as they were sweet and cooling.  The rice and beans were good as well, the cornbread was good but not the best (I'm very critical of cornbread), but the best part was that this was a very sizable meal that kept me full until the end of the day--no easy task.  If you're going to a Yankees game, do yourself a favor and come early so you can get some reasonably priced food here.  The staff is very friendly as are the patrons; one couple even started singing that song \"have I told you lately that I love you\" in front of the whole place when it came on the radio.  I wouldn't classify this as a can't miss necessarily, but its definitely solid, soulful home cooking.",
