        "caption": "Fornetto Mei is nestled into The Whitehall Hotel, a hidden gem on a tree-lined street of Chicago's Gold Coast.  After passing the threshold and strolling through the lounge/bar area a sense of time travel encapsulates the mind and transcends the experience to another era.  One of mahogany memories and speakeasy splendor.  The romantic dining hall boasts a \"beautiful little pizza oven,\" and is exceptionally quaint. We made same day, late night reservations via OpenTable and were promptly seated with smile.  However, it seemed as though walk-in service would not be frowned upon. The menu showcased seasonal ingredients, and the wine list was simply perfect to select from for the food offered.  We sipped Coppola Pinot Noir which was reasonably priced and familiar. Though the wine service lacked enthusiasm and knowledge.  The meal began with veal meatballs and mushroom bruschetta; both delicious and perfect portion sizes.  Chef Steve's short ribs and polenta was a dish that I wanted to savor for many moments.  In fact, I may or may not have licked the plate clean.  The tasty and tender meat melted into the creamy polenta.  Truly soul food and a dish worth spotlighting.  If you saved room for a dessert, indulge in the tiramisu for a pleasant finish. A lovely Chicago Restaurant Week prix fixe experience that left me craving a return to taste the remainder of this season's menu. Fornetto Mei is definitely worth considering as your next spot for a romantic date, a small celebration or an intimate conversation with a friend.",

        "caption": "Timing - friendly for a Friday night: A friend and I ate here for Restaurant Week. We made same-day reservations through Open Table for a Friday night at 8:00 pm, although it seemed they had available tables even without the reservations. ----- Location - tucked away and intimate: The restaurant is in the back of the Whitehall Hotel - the signage wasn't so clear, but the staff were helpful and it felt like a bit of an adventure finding it. The setting is simple but quiet and good for a nice conversation. ----- Cuisine - tasty and simple: We started with the beef carpaccio with micro greens, capers, and sea salt. The sea salt was a lovely crunch, the carpaccio was soft and delicious. I would definitely get it again. It isn't served with bread, so we had to ask for it, but ate it on its own and would probably have it that way again, it was so good. For the main course, we both had beef short rib with creamed polenta. The flavor was lovely and I ate it easily. I could tell my friend was a bit put off my too many soft textures, so it could be accompanied with something crunchy for people with similar sensibilities. For dessert, I had the lava cake, which had a nice flavor and came with a good raspberry sauce. It could have been more melty in the center. She had the tiramisu, which also had a good taste, but after all the rich and soft textures, it was probably a bit too much for her. ----- Drink Selection -  choose wisely: We had a bottle of the lowest cost chardonnay, which wasn't a great choice, and the wine service left a bit to be desired. ----- All in All - great spot: All in all, this was a great value for a solid meal that I wouldn't hesitate to repeat. Definitely a good spot during Restaurant Week.",
