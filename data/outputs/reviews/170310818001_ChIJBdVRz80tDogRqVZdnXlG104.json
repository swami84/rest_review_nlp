Their menu includes everything from salads to breakfast items to dinner plates and snacks. We received a variety and not only was it delicious, it was healthy and filling! Salads are typically not our first choice, but we were so impressed with how much flavor was packed into each one and am already craving them again!  We have tried other meal delivery services but were impressed with Farmer's Fridge the most. The convenience of the order, the ease of preparing the meal, and the overall quality and healthy options puts them above the competition. We can't wait to try more of their menu! Already eyeing the Buffalo Mac & Cheese and the Enchilada Roja plates......",
