We sat at the bar The server was really nice and helpful. The atmosphere was wonderfully inviting and the bar stools were very comfortable and plush.  THE FOOD : The tuna poke was more of cucumber and avocado poke with a sprinkle of Tuna ! The taste was good but the tuna portion needs to be more of 50/50 rather than 30/70 increase the price too  The  pasta was soggy, watery  and lukewarm. Again 30/70 ratio of CANNED mushrooms to pasta.  I did had an upset stomach all night long.  Im very disappointed, i will go again if they only have a big improvement in food preparation. Too bad !",

We haven't had chance to explore much during the pandemic, and in the before times, I'm sure we'd be visiting this place at least several times a month. The carpaccio was flavored perfectly, the octopus grilled to an excellent texture, and I've never seen truffle pieces so abundant in a mushroom risotto. We will be back for sure for more well-packaged takeout in the future, and look forward to a sit-down meal once this is all over.",

Our friends Chris and Mylang have been long time customers of Dante, and we ALL loved the food and staff at Vinotta. With 4 adults and a foodie 5 year old we had an big variety of choice at the table. Appetizers were Beef Carpaccio, Buffalo Mozzarella, Grilled Octopus and Insulata Romana. All extremely fresh, bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. Main Entrees were Ragu, Veal Piccata, Risotto de Mare, Linguinin with Clams, and Chicken Peperonata - once again phenomenal in presentation and flavors! And don't forget dessert...you must try these! We had drinks, we had wine - you can't go wrong.  If you are looking for a date night, somewhere to gather with good friends, or family meal, Vinotta is an excellent choice! Great food is one thing, excellent friendly staff is another! Dante and team you have hit it out of the park with your restaurant! We all can't wait to come back! See you soon :)",
