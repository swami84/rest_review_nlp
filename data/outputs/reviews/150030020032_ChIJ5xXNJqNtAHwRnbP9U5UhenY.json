I moved to the mainland just before the coronavirus outbreak, and I was always worried that the restaurant here would be hit by the corona. But why did I get to know the news here, but you are doing business! Thank you so much~ Thank you very much!! Next time I visit Hawaii, I will go here to eat. The boss's ribs are so delicious^^ Always be happy^^  (Original) \uc774\uacf3\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uae50 \uc77c\uc744 \ud588\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 \uc8fc\ubc29 \uae68\ub057, \uc7ac\ub8cc\ub294 \uc2e0\uc120, \uc704\uc0dd\ub3c4 \uad7f! \ub9db\uc740 \uba39\uc5b4\ubcf8 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774\uba74 \ub2e4 \uc544\uc2dc\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ed\uc2dc \uad7f\uc774\uc608\uc694\u314e \uac04\ud639 \ub9db\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\uc774 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uadf8\uac74 \uc190\ub2d8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc591\uacfc \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc548\ub9de\uc544\uc11c \uc77c\uaebc\uc608\uc694. \uc8fc\ubb38\uc2dc \uc9c1\uc6d0\uc774\ub098 \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8\uaed8 \uc5ec\ucb64\ubcf4\uc138\uc694! \uce5c\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uc798 \uc124\uba85\ud574\uc8fc\uc2e4\uaebc\uc608\uc694^^ \uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8 \ucee4\ud50c\ud558\uace0\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc544\ub294\uc0ac\uc774\ub294 \uc544\ub2c8\uc608\uc694. \uc5f0\ub77d\ub3c4 \uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc81c\uac00 \uc77c \ud560\ub54c \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8 \ucee4\ud50c\uc774 \ub9c8\uc74c\ub3c4 \ub530\ub73b\ud558\uc2dc\uace0 \ub108\ubb34 \uc88b\uc558\uc5b4\uc694. \uc81c\uac00 \ucf54\ub85c\ub098\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc9c1\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf8\ud1a0\ub85c \uc774\uc0ac\ub97c \uc640\uc11c \ucf54\ub85c\ub098\ub85c \uc774\uacf3 \uc2dd\ub2f9\uc774 \ud0c0\uaca9\uc744 \uc785\uc744\uae4c\ubd10 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uac71\uc815 \ub418\ub354\ub77c\uad6c\uc694. \ud5cc\ub370 \uc5b4\ucc0c \ud574\uc11c  \uc774\uacf3 \uc18c\uc2dd\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 \uc601\uc5c5\uc744 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc2dc\ub124\uc694! \ud734~\ucc9c\ub9cc\ub2e4\ud589\u314e \uc815\ub9d0\uc815\ub9d0 \ub2e4\ud589\uc774\uc608\uc694!! \ub2e4\uc74c\uc5d0 \ud558\uc640\uc774 \ubc29\ubb38\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba74 \ub9e4\uc77c \uc5ec\uae30 \uac00\uc11c \ubc25 \uba39\uc744\uaebc\uc608\uc694. \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8\ub124 \uac08\ube44 \uc9f1 \ub9db\uc788\uac70\ub4e0\uc694^^ \ud56d\uc0c1 \ud589\ubcf5\ud558\uc138\uc694^^",

There is also an array of sauces you can use to enhance your order. The price is definitely hard to beat as well especially for Waikiki.
