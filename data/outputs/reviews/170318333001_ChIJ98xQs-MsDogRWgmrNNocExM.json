The attitudes were unwarranted and I ultimately requested my money back before my order was placed. While discussing the matter with a cook who claimed to be the manager he was popping a pimple, ugh! The service is bad so I can only imagine the quality of the food. I contacted corporate about the issue and requested that the owner speak with me prior to this post. (I wanted to give the owner a chance to address the issue) but Russel #theowner was too busy. I don\u2019t recommend this place for anyone. Try BUSY BURGER OR ALS BEEF on Taylor along with the other great restaurants that treat their customers accordingly.",

We got off the phone and as I was waiting for the new sandwich to come, I gave the original sandwich to my roommate. They called about 10 mins later asking if I could return the old sandwich and I explained the situation and mentioned they didn\u2019t tell me anything about returning the sandwich on the original phone call and they said okay. A FULL hour and a half later I get a call that they are here with my sandwich. When I went to go eat it I saw that ONCE AGAIN they forgot the avocado spread.

He was very rude and had no regard for how my food was prepared incorrectly, when trying to communicate this with the preparers his service edicate was that of someone untrained to deal with customer relations/requests..... and in fact became a cost inefficient problem for any restaurant owner. I'm certainly positive if there was a Jimmy Johns owner present.... His approach to customer service would have been better... I hope , especially for the future success of such a fantastic food chain such as this one! It didn't seem to matter to a GM of a restaurant that he threw money in the garbage in the form of prepared Sandwiches because he was unable to properly provide adequate service to me as a customer.That ideology is counterproductive to operating expenses of any food establishment ,as an owner of a restaurant I would not enjoy having to discard Food unnecessarily because of a GMs poor people skills!Thank God that there are several other Jimmy Johns establishments with better service than this particular one.",

Also they have 8\" sandwiches which is unusual when you go to subways or potbellys. I got my sandwich cold as I forgot to mention it needed to be toasted but it turned out to be good.
