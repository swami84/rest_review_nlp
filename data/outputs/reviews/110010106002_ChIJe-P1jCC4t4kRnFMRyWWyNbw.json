I told them I'll pay for a raspberry cheesecake cookie, he immediately threw 3 cookies and the bag and rung me up for the 3 cookies. I told him I only would like one cookie, he told me the minimum purchase of cookies to use the bathroom would be 3.

        "caption": "This Subway is unfortunately located right by a Metro bus stop. Because of the location it attracts some of the most undesirable customers you can imagine. The employees do a good job of maintaining their composure and professionalism despite having to deal with homeless people, rude customers, broke customers, and an alarming amount of people with mental health and/or drug dependency problems.  I used to frequent this location due to a job I had nearby. I never had an employee treat me badly, but a few times there was confusion due to how busy that location gets and because of a language barrier.  The only reason that Subway is open is because of all of the federal government employees that work nearby. If it has to rely solely on local residents it would've closed many years ago.  I've witnessed people come in and expect to be served immediately so that they could catch their bus, despite there being a line. I've witnessed people order a sub, watch it be made to their exact specifications, then argue the price despite the prices being clearly marked on the menu hanging on the wall. Customers have engaged in arguments with the employees because of perceived slights or whatever other reason they felt they needed to insult the customers. I can guarantee you that most of the people who've left negative reviews here were the same people who went into that Subway with an attitude or other personal problems and berated the staff.  It should also be noted that this Subway is located inside the same building as federal probation agency (CSOSA). Offenders love Subway just like anyone else and they are also some of the same customers that make the experience of going there for food entertaining and disappointing. To be clear, some of the people who work nearby are jerks to the staff as well. It's not just the local residents.  I've given four stars solely because of the service and quality of food. If I was rating based on the deplorables that frequent that location I would've given one star, but I can't fault Subway for who it attracts as customers.",
