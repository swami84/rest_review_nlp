The sink was backed up with some sort of brown liquid. The toilet was marred & dirty from God knows what. All but one light was out & that one working one was flickering. This felt like it could have been the set of a SAW movie. I went in to wash my hands but to be honest I think my hands were cleaner before entering that purgatory.
