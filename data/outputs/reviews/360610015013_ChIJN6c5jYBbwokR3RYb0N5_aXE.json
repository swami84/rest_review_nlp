Don\u2019t care too much about the organic description but decided to try for Restaurant Week lunch to-go. The prices on the normal menu are much higher than other Thai places I\u2019ve been to.  I got the \u201cstir-fry flat noodle with chicken\u201d with Tom kha chicken soup and the chive dumplings. I also got a side of coconut rice.  To be frank, the food was not very good.  The chive dumplings were four small bites soaked overwhelmingly in a soy sauce.  The soup was probably the best part. The coconut flavoring was nice with the fresh veggies.  The stir-fly flat noodle I expected to be closer to a pad see ew. Instead, it was a flavorless dish more similar to Chinese Chow Fun but with even less flavor. It was also half bean sprouts which was not listed in the description. It\u2019s a weird dish to sell during restaurant week at a Thai restaurant.  The rice was dyed a nice blue (butterfly pea I expect) but was hard and a bit flavorless for coconut rice.  Overall, the food was very meh at a pretty high price point...close to double other Thai restaurants in the city. I don\u2019t think I would order from here again.",

I will have to try the others. I took my friend here tonight and they loved it. Food, service and ambience overall is good. Plenty of heated seating outdoors and also some seating indoors.

The set up outside was nice, with plastic partitions between the larger tables, plants and decorations that allow you to feel comfortable in the space. The food was delicious, organic and they have many vegan choices. The real stand out though was the staff. Our waitress was extremely personable, caring and attentive, and two other folks also came by to check on us. Usually when a place is new there are growing pains, and we were informed that at busy times the food may take longer because the kitchen on the building had not originally been set up for Thai cooking, but we did not have any issues. It was an extremely pleasant experience with a very full, happy belly to go with.",

Great location in a quieter neighborhood, mere footsteps from the Brooklyn Bridge. I would recommend this place to ALL!
