Smokehouse pizza had a fine flavor, but definitely didn't enjoy the large clumps of cheese just thrown on top. Pizza crust was just like the stix.. just flat and too chewy.  Would potentially come back to this location for something else, but was disappointed this time in comparison to the Nashville and Edinburgh locations.",

We ordered the wings as an appetizer with a bourbon sauce that was so delicious. The Smokehouse and Homestead pizza paired with 6ft Blonde Beer and Busted Knuckle beer sent my taste buds into a feeding frenzy! We enjoyed watching the Purdue football game while we ate. Our waitress was so sweet and very personable. We are planning a trip to see the brewery in Nashville. So thankful we found Big Woods in West Lafayette, we\u2019ll definitely be back!",

The meats taste over charred as if the grill wasn\u2019t cleaned properly.  Visited a second time today in hopes that maybe it was a one time thing. Same thing. The meats on both the burger and chicken sandwich tasted over charred and burnt. We let the staff know so hopefully it\u2019ll change. Could be a lot better if the food was cooked well.",
