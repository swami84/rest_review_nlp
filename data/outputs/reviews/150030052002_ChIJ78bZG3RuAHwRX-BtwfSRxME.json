We ordered through door dash and the prices are too high for how much food they actually give you. So here is our rating. Well start with needs improvements to needs to sustain.  3 stars on the price: Too high for the amount of food they give you. We ordered seafood pumpkin soup and there\u2019s only chopped up shrimp and chopped up scallops in a maybe 3 cups container for $20 I expected a variety of \u201cseafood\u201d if we must call it that. Otherwise it\u2019s chopped shrimp and scallops.  2 stars on the fact that they gave us the broth for my daughters wonton noodle soup without the wonton or the noodles.  2 stars in the $24 dollar one cup of beef tenderloin with black pepper and onions. For $24 the beef tenderloin should\u2019ve been flying but it didn\u2019t taste special enough to only give us a cup of it for the price.  However, 4 stars on the flavors. The pumpkin noodle soup is surprisingly delicious.  The Lamb Stew with Bean Curd Casserole is also amazing.  The steamed chicken feet is also flavorful.  They also recover by sending us another batch of wonton noodle soup but 3 stars on the fact that I had to spend another $15 just so the door dash can deliver what they forgot on our order.  In that $15 4 stars on the coconut mochi.  That\u2019s why this rating could\u2019ve been 5 stars if they lower their prices slightly and not inconvenience their customers in forgetting their food.  The flavor I\u2019d say makes up for it...a little!!",

They try to forcr dimsum dishes onto your table, and during dimsum hours we were trying to order from the menue. We gad to ask multiple times for someone to come and take our order. It wasn't until 30 minutes aftet that we actually got to put our order down. To add on, the ordering was a mess! They got my order wrong even though I pointed directly to the order. When the order came, I told them it was wrong and they took it away to replace the order with the correct one. I had ordered Beef chow fun with black bean, pointed it out to the waiter yet he got it wrong! And when my correct order came, I took a bite of the beef, but it was undercooked! I decided to give up asking because they obviously could'nt understand me so my experience here was completely ruined. I feel like I have to write this review to save people some money and some time. If I could give 0 stars, I would. If you want to go to a good Chinese restaurant where you will not be disappointed, go to Happy Days in Kaimuki instead! Way better, service is great, and they are polite.",

Had to wait to become cool enough to eat. Jin doing and custard is the tops. Not greasy or flakey. Jin dui had a nice crust to it, an the custard held it's shape during the entire consumption. Tripe was a little bland, and the sauce was overpowering. I would say the sauce was premade, and the tripe was blanched and mixed with the sauce. Shu Mai had small but firm, whole shrimp in it. Spare ribs was unremarkable, about the same as others. But it did lack bones. What it did have was tendon, which was surprisingly soft and edible. Would have mistaken it for fat if it wasn't for the crunchyness.",
