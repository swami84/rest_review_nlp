After complaining to the cashier for the second time she had someone prepare my food. My bag seemed light so I looked inside and there were 2 burritos inside. I went back and told the cashier and she apologized about the mistake and said she would correct it. I got a bag with food Inside and rushed away. When I got home I found they put both BURRITOS in bowls. Are you kidding me? This was a deliberate act. To top it off they didn't have any meat in them and we're half the size of a normal burrito. I will never return. Stay away from this place at all costs!",

All that money only to received very little food....smdh!!! The owner needs to really supervise these worker and see how the costumers are getting cheated.",

Outside of NYC Chipotle is always a fine option but just like every other Chipotle in the area, it is terrible. Check reviews none of them exceed 2 Stars.",
