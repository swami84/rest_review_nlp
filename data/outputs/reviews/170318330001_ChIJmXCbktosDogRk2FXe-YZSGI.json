In the beginning we went up to the host stand and we asked if that was the le\u00f1a brava hoststand, and we were just told to go into the restaurant, once inside we approached a server which then led us back to the host stand we were just at. The server tried to get the attention of the hostess as she and the other hostess were having a conversation, the server tapped the hostess on the shoulder at least three to four times until she finally looked back and asked me if I had a reservation, she was very polite and welcoming once the server had to direct us back to her, I just didnt understand why we didn't get that in the beginning when I went up to the host sand. Immediately after we sat down we had a great time, we loved our server, he was great, unfortunately I don't remember his name, but service was great, food was phenomenal! drinks? phenomenal . We had the octopus dish which was one of our favorite, we had the le\u00f1a ceviche which was also pretty great, we also had the short rib, which basically fell off the bone it was THAT good. The hubby had the skirt steak which he also enjoyed. Overall an amazing experience, thank you Rick Bayless, another extremely satisfied customer.",

All of their dishes are delicious and the method of the way they cook them is something that you cannot replicate in your home kitchen.  I highly recommend the dishes below  Lena Ceviche - the juice is just unreal. You would want to empty out the entire bowl.  Charred Avocado - great texture and smooth.  Chicken Al Carbon - marinate is the key and there is flavor in every part of the chicken all the way to the bone.  Plantains - soft and creamy.  The Skirt Steak and Short Rib are also top-notch.  For 2 people expect to spend around $80 to $100 with drinks and tip.  Portions are decent and satisfying.  The Full Chicken is really a FULL Sized Chicken.",

Everything we ordered was so well done and the customer service was great.  I ordered the ceviche, scallops and wood oven tart. My friends also tried the pineapple aguachile, short rib, arroz con verduas. Every dish was delicately put together, the flavors were unique, and every bite was savored.  Not only was the food great, but the wait staff was all very kind and knowledgeable about the food and wine being served. We asked for wine recommendations and were kindly helped.

I think this is our favorite of the Bayless restaurants. But the ordering process and time to get our food was excessive (40+ min from ordering to receiving dessert; also, waiter still hadn't come by to get dinner order by the time our ceviche arrived). We were hungry when we got there; starving when dinner arrived (had to order an extra ceviche and side to ride us over); and ready to cancel dessert and leave except is was my birthday and the group wanted to have sweets.  They also really don't do apps and no bread or chips at the table, so put in ceviche and dinner order all at once and consider dessert before completely done w/ dinner. Unless you want to have a 3 hr dinner like us. So a 5 for the food, and a 3 for all the waiting (service itself was pretty good tho).  Bayless' brewery Cruz Blanca is right next door for pre- or post-dinner beers. But no flights or tasters like EVERY OTHER brewery, unfortunately.",

Our server seemed at first very attentive until we did not bite on her upsells so most of her attention went to other tables.  She also forgot a couple of our apps.  And then, when some other guy served our pork , we asked that it be sliced and his response was \"well I gave you a knife\" Unreal.  He then rethought his answer and took it back to the kitchen for slicing.  The pork was void of any flavor...very disappointing.  The chicken was good. Lena Brava is not what it once was.

The food was mediocre, nothing special but nothing bad.  However, we waited for over an hour for one of our desserts with no updates or apologies.  On top of that I received a $175 parking ticket in which their valet service had gotten me and was only made aware once I received it in the mail.  I emailed and called the restaurant over a 2 month period with no response.  Needless to say we will not be going back to here or any affiliated restaurants.  The ability to rectify the situation was non-existent.",

I've not been a fan of Bayless restaurants and my family had told me that the food here was not very good.  It was a warm night and upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by the hostess and the burning wood fire oven.  Needless to say, I was warmer now.  Thankfully we were seated on the second floor and the AC was very very nice here, almost too nice..... There were 9 of us seated so we all had the 5 course Baja Experience.  First course: le\u00f1a ceviche and ceviche maki roll.  I thought both were very good, though I preferred the maki over the ceviche.  Much more flavors in the maki. Second course: Fideos.  This was an angel hair pasta in a green Chipotle sauce.  I liked this as it reminded me of a dish my aunt in Mexico used to make me when I was missing American food. Third course: braised short rib and tamal. The ribs were so delicious.  I was grabbing at it with my tortilla right off the bone.  The tamal was interesting as it was  polenta style and was topped with vegetables.  Not like Mom used to make.  It was ok. Fourth course: striped bass.  This was the star of the night.  Wow.  I loved this and ate half of the dish.  It was really great and I could have had my other friends portions on the other side of the table. Fifth: the wood oven tart.  I'm not one for desserts but this was very good.  See photo.  These were very good sized portions too.  I did not leave hungry.  But I did leave very very cold.  I sat under an AC vent and it did not turn off all night.  I probably could have asked to change it but I took one for the patrons.  But I was freezing.  I would return and try their carnitas, to see just how similar and different it is from traditional carnitas.  Oh, and drinks were very good.  Try a spicy margarita, with mezcal.  I loved it.  Thought margaritas are not on the menu, I ordered one, and the waitress chuckled when I did.  Maybe it's just something they really don't want to do but hey, I'm the customer! \ud83d\ude0a",

I chose 5 courses and found the portions to be ample. All of the dishes i tried were interesting and had different flavors...very savory! The stripped bass course offered an haba\u00f1ero  sauce as an option... and boy was it spicy... and i love spice....totally awesome. My only complaint was the occasional use of mayo on some dishes... it\u2019s 2019.... mayo adds a stupid amount of calories an mutes the other flavors... not overly intricate. The black cod cooked perfectly and exceptional. Overall, great meal and I would happily return!",

It came with cauliflower mash potatoes.  (Cauliflower Mash was delicious) The beef was good, however, I didn't care for the \"fat\" that was on the beef. For the price I paid for this entree, my meal came on a small plate. I was still hungry and bummed! My husband ordered spicy blue jumbo shrimp. He enjoyed the shrimp.  We ordered 2 sides: fingerling poatoes and swiss chard. The potaotes were tasty. I didn't like the swiss chard because the vinegar and some other seasoning that tasted gross.  My server was so sweet to bring a birthday treat for me (pistachio ice cream with crumbled cookie and hibiscus jam) the jam was a tad too tart for my liking. I did enjoy, the icecream and crumbled cookie.  Would I come back? Maybe  Be sure to order several dishes to taste from so you can get a taste of what the restaurant offers.",

As usual for Bayless the flavors are bright and vibrant.  The menu has a \"cold\" section for more raw preparations and a hot side from the wood fired grill and oven.  We started with the Lena from the Ceviche menu. Great flavor from the green chile and not too spicy - just a little heat on the back of your tongue. It develops nicely.  We also had the Uni, Pan Campo (Uni Flatbread) which is definitely in the running for my favorite dish of the year. Uni, Albacore, and spicy avocado mash (habanero and wasabi, yum!) on a fresh crispy flatbread.  So much texture, so much flavor, so much going on.  This was a really great dish and a must for you Uni seekers.  It is worth making the trip just for this.  Grilled Endive, Chipotle, and Blood Orange salad was terrific.  Orange, Turnip, and Fennel combined for a flavorful team and again lot's of good textural interplay, along with the bright of the citrus and smokiness of the Chipotle.  Not sure how Bayless layers in so many flavors for each dish, but he is like the Frank Lloyd Wright of flavor.  Mains were both delicious.  On a chilly night in Chicago the Seafood Pozole really hit the spot.  Wonderfully flavorful broth did need a bit of spicing up (which we were eagerly provided by our server) so this is probably good news for those of you who are spice averse. Black Cod was delightful.  But the can't miss item was one of the side dishes - Corn Masa \"Polenta.\"  Sweet, creamy and popping with corn flavor.  I could have eaten it by the bowl full.  You get this and the Uni Flatbread and you can die a happy person - keto be damned.",

I ordered the Tomahawk Steak ($90.00 Dollars dish) , the waitress told me it was enough for 2 people but that was a lie because that was a portion for one person, plus the steak wasn't even hot, I think that if you are paying $90.00 Dollars for a dish the less they can do is to served it Hot right?  So I noticed that they have scallops on the menu so thought why not, it was a $30.00 dollars dish so I was thinking (they must give you a good portion right) so I ordered 2 of those and what was my surprise when the scallops arrived? A plate with 3 scallops medium size with some yellow mole salsa, I'm sorry but to me that was just ridiculous and the scallops were OK, nothing special, so they are charging $10.00 per scallop, I don't know about you guys but to me that's a joke.  Anyway, if you are interested in trying this place just be ready to pay for overpriced regular food my friends.   \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc",

We watched all the lyft and ubers drop people off and even got to see how quickly a boot is put on a vehicle, and even better the couples reaction when they saw what had happened. If your in the area this place has great views, an amazing dessert menu, cocktail list and selection of beers.",

We added the Broccoli Rabe, Sweet Potato and 2 Tepache (drinks!) all of these were a great add on. We also tried the Verde Vacation and Baja Breeze both were very unique and will try again. We then finished the meal with the Wood Oven Tart dessert that was recommended to us and it was excellent.

The Hibiscus Beauty also didn\u2019t disappoint. As the starter we chose the Le\u00f1a Ceviche. It was so fresh and woodsie with the tortilla chips. We followed that with the Tamal, \u201cHuevona\u201d Salsa, Charred Brussels Sprouts. The tamal was cooked perfectly and would fall apart in your mouth. The wood fire after taste was very subtle and everything else was the perfect pairing with the tamal. Then we ordered the Pork Shank Carnitas, and if you want a Mexican experience, that\u2019s the dish for you. The carnitas were perfect and also great for breakfast with leftovers. The salsa and beans made the perfect carnita tacos. As a side, we are the sweet potato, ancho, goat cheese. Delicious. Perfectly cooked and perfect blend of flavors under the wood fire. Last but not least, dessert....Chocolate Tamal Cake, melts in your mouth. The chocolate sauce is so rich and thick. The ice cream was a good balance and matched the candied amaranth alegria with the chocolate flavors. I can\u2019t wait to go again!",

We came in well before the dinner crowd and had reservation, sadly were seated by the connecting door to another restaurant and the cold draft was horrible.  Asked to be seated someplace else but apparently tables were taken.  No worries, we won\u2019t fuss but do ensure the heat is up at least or perhaps not put a table there.  Waiter comes by, doesn\u2019t explain the menu even though I read English...so I attempted to ask him what\u2019s difference between various sections to the menu since there seemed to be appetizer type items in entree section.  Waiter disappears for good 13 mins till he came back finally to take our order, everything was ordered together since it seems like our waiter was a bit unreliable.  My wife ordered braised short rib, and I ordered the  Cod and we shared a ceviche.  The ceviche was extremely lemony and tart, we thought it may be how this is done at ricks place, so again did t make a fuss about it.  My cod was very good, however, presentation was horrible since it looked like the sauce settled like it was microwaved.  My wife\u2019s short ribs were extremely dry, and after that we just decided to pay for our meal and got our dessert someplace else since it was just not a satisfying experience.",

It shouldn't be a surprise that everything came out perfect and the service was attentive. The menu is adventurous but very solid, focusing a bit more on seafood. The cocktails were complex and sophisticated (i.e. layers of flavors). I'm not an oyster person (too many disappointments in the past) but the oysters here were excellent. I'd highly recommend this as a starter. I finished the striped bass that's meant for two by myself - it's that good. We had the tart for dessert - to me it was good but I'd skip that next time and have another cocktail.",

Scallops also excellent mainly due to the mole. Not quite as good were appetizers. An average cervice. Hi Ramada good but served on ice cold stone that froze the accompanying sauces. Corn crackers served with apps was burnt.  But then a wonderful fruit tart with raspberry sorbet. Outstanding mezcal menu that server didn\u2019t know much about. Pours very much on the might side. Service in general was acceptable but not too attentive.  Some great things about this meal. Some not so much. Overall an enjoyable night. Not sure if I\u2019d go back, but I\u2019d recommend trying it at least once.",

The menu is divided up into \"Ice\" dishes, which are cold, and \"Fire\" dishes which are hot. The only minor complaint I have is that my Tamal didn't have as much spice as I had expected. But, I didn't ask for more spice either. Overall, it's a great restaurant that I'll definitely come back to!",

We made reservations for 9:00 PM but did not receive our entrees until well after 10:00. We had two appetizers that for some reason were spaced 20 minutes a part. The oysters were full of shell debris and grime. The steak was 7/10 but the fist underwhelming. Honestly, if I could do the whole night again, I'd much rather keep it simple at small cheval with a friendly, inviting environment, and food appropriately priced. Maybe this restaurant was a great find at one time; however, I now worry it is past its prime and riding the coat-tails of its former glory.",
