This place is very nice and inexpensive. The food was very good. They serve omelets,  scrambled eggs, and many other options for breakfast. Employees are very nice, the place has a nice decoration, and atmosphere. I will come back next Time I'm in town for work.",

This local coffee shop located at downtown that serve northern part of the downtown area. They do Catering and provide sandwich and munch. The place is trendy. I like vibrant atmosphere.  Today I am going for the mocha ice coffee. It is a bit chocolatier but have all the mojo. Good tasty coffee. Just to let all you know, caffeine never affects me. Most of the time I drink coffee is for the flavor and pleasure. They do have good flavor.",

Ordered 2 gluten free cubans (heresy for the bread, I know), they were toasted warm and still warm after I walked back to the office, but the only peevish thing was all the meat was plopped in the center of the bread instead evenly distributed. Again, peevish, but it was still very tasty.  Will be going back to try their breakfast options and other gluten free items.",

We decided to get a couple of Italian sandwiches, and we were delighted to see that the meat was actually Italian-quality meat... like in th sandwiches you get up north, not the substitute mystery meat blends you get on most Italian sandwiches. However, correct me if I am wrong, I believe that you are supposed to remove the stems from the pepperoncinis before you hide them on the sandwiches you are serving. Pretty unpleasant surprise to get a stem jammed in your gums after that first bite.",
