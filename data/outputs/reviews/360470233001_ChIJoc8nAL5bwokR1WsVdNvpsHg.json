I walked in and the energy is irie. We enquired about each other's health mental and otherwise. The nice lady told me when the pandemic first hit they closed for two weeks to quarantine themselves. When they reopened they did a thorough disinfectant of the restaurant and I could feel the clean.  The Food: The best I can offer up is that you try it yourself. I'd like to have them cook just for me but I also want them to survive this period. Please support. Try some other delivery option than what I tried though. But maaaaan! Their food hits just right!
