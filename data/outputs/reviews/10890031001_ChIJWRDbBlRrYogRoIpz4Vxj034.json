We both ordered a steak medium rare but when we got them it was well done. I wanted to pay and leave but my wife made sure i said something and when the server looked at them he was upset that we ordered medium rare and the were well done. They took one steak off the bill but I didn't care I just wanted to leave and would have paid the whole bill. We didn't eat our steak and were disappointed because we had a babysitter that night and it's not easy for us to go out a lot.  Extremely surprised because we heard good things. We just hope that it was a fluke and that someone was having a bad night. It wasn't the server's fault and he was tipped as if our food was great. I hope you'll have better entr\u00e9es than we did.",

Once all were seated and ordered, we did not receive drinks for another 25 mins. At that point we ordered two appetizers, and when they arrived, they were on the same platter. This made it very difficult to share among 8 people at a long table. We were not allowed to order entrees while appetizers were on the table. Once they were gone, we had to ask twice for dirty plates, unused glasses, etc to be removed. The table was full of dishes. Then were told we could not order entrees, only salads. Same story here. We had to wait 25 mins to receive our salads, and eat them, before we could order entrees. Entrees finally ordered. Food was fine. Not great, but fine. No complaints but no wow factor. All in all, our meal took 3 and a half hours. No one at the table was satisfied with this. Considering this was a $1200 meal, we all felt as if we should have had better service at a bare minimum.",

Over Christmas we dropped in to the bar for drinks and the staff was great as usual. The bartender was whipping up made to order classic cocktails with a twist. His Spanish Coffee is phenomenal. Andy, Executive chef came out later and sat with us, chatted us up and shared a couple of shots. And the bartender even let us try his newest experimental creation to get feedback - it was an apple based cocktail. Great guys, they care about their food and their customers.  Most recently, my wife and I celebrated our 7th anniversary there and it was a fantastic choice. We started with cocktails - I had a solid whisky sour, she had the finalized version of the Apple cocktail - she said it was on point.  For appetizer she had the crab cake - always solid, and I had the chicken fried quail. I followed up with their house old fashioned - it was the deftest cocktail I\u2019ve ever tried. Layered flavors and aromas, the complexity sustained my attention and the flavors were very focused.  We followed up with the winter greens and fried okra salad. And our entrees were the prime ribeye with chumichurri and the venison with foie gras sausage and port cherry sauce.  Finally I wrapped up with a Spanish coffee. I can\u2019t tell you how great of a meal it was. And it was made better because our server, Jonas, was attentive and gave great recommendations.  I hope The Bottle remains a local institution for years to come. They provide all the class if their competitors with more warmth and a healthy dose of creativity I haven\u2019t found anywhere else in the fine dining scene lately",

I chose the pork tenderloin with conecuh gravy, parmesan grits and roasted onion and squash. The tenderloin was excellently seasoned and cooked, perfectly complimented by the conecuh gravy. The parmesan grits were creamy and rich. The roasted squash and onions were also a good compliment. Brother in law had the 40ounce tomahawk steak. NOT for the faint of heart, nor the small stomached! Paired with roasted fingerlings and broccolini. Classic. He nearly finished it. The prices are in line with other higher end restaraunts. We managed to have an app, a salad, two entrees, two drinks, and a single alcoholic drink for $125.00. The Bottle had two drinks that I was surprised to see. A sazerac, with absinthe, though I am not sure if it contained wormwood. Also, an applejack, a hard liquor that dates to colonial days. I refrained from the sazerac, but did have an applejack. Smooth but with a bite. If you go, ask for Erica. She is super attentive, knowledgeable about each offering, and lots of fun! Overall,  an excellent experience, and one the redhead and I might repeat for a special occassion.",

For our entrees we had the pork tenderloin and grouper.  Both entrees were, again, fine, but definitely not worth the cost.  And neither entree was memorable enough for us to return.  All in all it was still a nice night out.  However, while we were finishing up there was a server bussing a dirty table.  We witnessed him gather all of the unused wine glasses (ones that had been sitting on the table throughout the group's entire meal) and put them back into their \"clean\" wine glass cabinet with the rest of the glasses.  Pandemic or not, this should never be an appropriate practice in any restaurant.",

We went on a Tuesday so not a busy night and scored the round booth in the bar. Jeremy took care of us and the whole bar area including dreaming up and creating some amazing cocktails! See photo below. Oysters were delicious, shrimp would be a good shareable as it was a lot of shrimp! Venison and pork chop were great with well thought vegetables and flavors. Noticed people just coming in to the bar for cocktails and know why after experiencing Jeremy\u2019s wizardry! Will definitely be back and will stay on the bar side!",

The menu is well balanced, with a top meat-oriented selection, and a remarkable fish and seafood selection, the latter being nothing short of impressive.  The general inspiration is French, but it is not nouvelle cuisine, as the portions are plenty and usually include sauces in their structure. In a way, it would be traditional French more than nouvelle cuisine. They often bring new seasonal items: duck, almond tarts, etc. Their salads are actually excellent and well presented, it may seem trivial but it is always a pleasure to see a well-constructed salad for me.  Importantly, the service is as good as the food, with professional waiters and waitresses who know the profession. I really have no complaints about The Bottle. It is not cheap, nor should you expect something cheap, but you will get what you pay for: a top quality food experience and service.",

The drinks were the only good thing I could say about my experience. I\u2019ve never in my life seen oysters so small, and to charge $18 for 6 oysters the size of dimes should be criminal. I wish I had taken a picture, because my boss and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing about how small they were.  Then there was the main course, we waited over an hour after ordering to get our food, even though our party was literally one of two tables there. Never mind that we had the most annoying server, who would not stop bothering us while we tried to talk. She thought it was more important to clean the crumbs up off the table but not remove the unused wine glasses that were in everyone\u2019s way. Salads were ridiculously overpriced and aren\u2019t included with the meal so I didn\u2019t get one. My steak came out lukewarm, which I would\u2019ve said something about, had it not taken so long to come out and I was starving (you know, after those oysters really didn\u2019t hit the spot.) The dinner portions were small and I honestly left still hungry. Who goes to a steakhouse and leaves hungry??  I can honestly say I will never go to the bottle again. If I want to go to a nice dinner and spend my hard earned money, I\u2019ll go to Connor\u2019s or Char or Cotton Row.",

With all of the options for dining downtown, The Bottle has reached the bottom based on total experience vs price.  The location and atmosphere of the restaurant is quiet lovely.  Cocktails were very good but it ends there.  My steak was average at best.  My partner had ordered his steak Medium Rare but received Medium Well.... completely unacceptable.  Service was poor with the waiter disappearing for long periods of time.  My water glass was empty for over 10 minutes, so I drank my partner's water.  The dessert I ordered was hands down the worst I have ever received at a restaurant.  The flavor profiles did not pair well together, and the sesame syrup tasted scorched.  Terrible!  To be a fine dining establishment, a complete miss for the evening from service to quality and taste of the food.",

The good: - Excellent service, waiters were knowledgeable about the food - Easy online reservation through Google maps - Food presentation is pretty good  The bad: - All of the pictured food on Google maps is seasonal, they didn't have the rack of lamb or the chocolate dome available. I ended up with a salad and appetizer as a main course - We ordered a medium well filet mignon and got well done, the potatoes were cold, and the vegetables so undercooked they were basically raw. When there is only one hot plate ordered that's not really acceptable to us personally.  It ended up being a nearly $75 ($90 with tip) meal that I would have been disappointed paying half that, if the food had been cooked properly, and the items on Google maps actually available it easily would have met that price tags standard, as is we probably won't be making a return trip.",

We went on a Tuesday so not a busy night and scored the round booth in the bar. Jeremy took care of us and the whole bar area including dreaming up and creating some amazing cocktails! See photo below. Oysters were delicious, shrimp would be a good shareable as it was a lot of shrimp! Venison and pork chop were great with well thought vegetables and flavors. Noticed people just coming in to the bar for cocktails and know why after experiencing Jeremy\u2019s wizardry! Will definitely be back and will stay on the bar side!",

When two people are judged because they are younger and couldn't possibly be old enough to afford the meal and a 20% tip, that bothers me. Our waiter was attentive and friendly to the other tables he had, but not to ours. He would talk to his other tables for extended periods of time and couldn't get away from our table fast enough. I don't appreciate when I'm still talking to someone, and they are walking away when I am talking to them. For the money you spend, you would assume that everything would blow you away. 3 stars because for over 100 dollars, the meal and service were not worth what we paid at all.",

From my point of view it is normal to adress the daytime if you join the table for the first time or to say something like \"enjoy the dish\" if you serve the starter or dessert. Beside this I would expect a \"amuse-gueule\", fish knives or different glasses for the red or the white. In addition, we experienced plates, which were not shiny. These points are a no go with respect to the pricing level. However, the Chef de Cuisine seems to be great. The dishes which we had chosen last Saturday were very delicious - no doubt about this.",

I had the beet salad, which sounds pretty lame, but was surprisingly delicious and I'd be happy to have it again. Drinks are well made.  The price is a little steep, and it can be argued the food might fall short of the cost, if only slightly. Still, it's definitely worth a try and there's a good chance you'll be happy like I was.",

They brought us new steaks and they over cooked hers again!   It looked like they left it grill on one side for 10 min.  Expect better.  Original review.  Had planned on going to Big Oh for a rare date with my wife but they closed early due to weather concerns aparently. I've never been to the bottle or any if it's predacessors in over a decade of living here but said what the heck tonight.  Sat at the bar. Huntsville newcomer Daniel was tending bar.  Interesting character and makes great drinks.  Helped make for a fun evening on a slow winter night.  Big thanks to Andy who was so bored due to lack of customers he made us a multi-course dinner sample. Ahi tuna...scallops were to die for... grouper impeccable.  Amazing first trip. Thanks to all involved.  Will be back soon.",

Everything was expertly prepared and the flavors were amazing. Carey was very helpful and attentive throughout our dinner.

Chef Andy has visited our table every evening, looking for feedback and keeping his finger on the pulse beat. He earnestly cares. Creative wonderful sauces. Never too much salt. Blueberry coulis with venison, anything involving mushrooms! Truffle butter filet... Love his lamb, veal, duck & steaks. Everything is always perfect. One of the top 3 in Huntsville for a romantic dinner.",

They weren't awful they just werent very good- slow to greet us (we had a reservation) and no one was at the hostess stand when we got there. - group of about 15 of us waiting 5 or so minutes before someone finally come over and greeted us. We waited another 5 or so minutes before someone offered us water and another 5 min before we saw our waitress. No deal breakers with regards to service but just not overly impressed with the staff.  It is not the quality staff you'd get at Cotton Row. As far as fine dining in Huntsville goes it's better than Grille 29 but it will be awhile before I go back.",
