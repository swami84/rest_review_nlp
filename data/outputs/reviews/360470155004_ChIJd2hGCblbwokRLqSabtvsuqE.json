This is a hidden gem in\u00a0Brooklyn!!! The restaurant is very cozy, calm and gives a very nice home like vibe. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The place is very clean and hand sanitizer is readily available.\u00a0We ordered the BBC Tea, Thai Iced Tea with bubbles, Thai Fish Cake, Steamed Dumplings\u00a0(ground pork, shrimp, snow peas), Chicken Pad Thai and Spicy Chicken Basil.  Both drinks were delectable. I feel like the BBC Tea is extremely unique\u00a0due to the addition of the\u00a0cream brulee and brown sugar bubble. This drink is extremely addicting. I want another one as we speak lol.\u00a0Both\u00a0drinks weren't too sweet, just right. The Thai Fish Cakes didn't have a\u00a0strong fish taste as I expected, but that's a good thing. I've had fish cakes from other places and the ones sold here are in a league of it's own (yes, in a good way). I have to thank our server for recommending\u00a0this appetizer.\u00a0 The\u00a0Steamed Dumpling, Tom Kha with shrimp,\u00a0Spicy Chicken Basil were tasty and kept you wanting more.  The Chicken Pad Thai has a different take on the classic Pad Thai that I'm used to. The Chicken was juicy along with\u00a0the noodles. There was added citrus in this dish which takes Pad Thai to a different level.  My family and I are getting spoiled at One More Charm. We will be going back. The staff\u00a0said they will be adding more offerings to their menu. I'm looking forward to returning and trying these offerings. Can't wait to see what the future holds for this place because it's simply amazing. I\u00a0highly recommend this place\u00a0to everyone!!!",

The bubble tea was what first caught my attention and they are delicious! Gonna save us a trip to KungFu from now on which is just too far. Highly recommend the black /honey/Yuzu tea! Food is just AMAZING. We got the Panang curry lunch and the Kao Moo Dang and both were arguably the best Thai food we have had in park slope. Make sure you get the chive pancake. It\u2019s SOOOOO GOOD. The service is exceptional- everyone here is so NICE. The place is kept sparkling clean. Really recommend this place.",

Unlike other boba places around here, the tea was not too sweet, and tasted much more natural. I am so happy that this opened in Park Slope! One More Charm is exactly was Seventh Ave needed. I will be back soon! PS: I reccommend the butterfly fizz to everyone. It is SO DELICIOUS!!",
