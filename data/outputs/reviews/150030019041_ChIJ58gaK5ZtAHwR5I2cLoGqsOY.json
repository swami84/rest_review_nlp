(Yogurt, banana, muffin, etc.) Probably because he is a Korean owner, the menu had Bulgogi. It was delicious because it was just made. However, fried rice and fried noodles are a bit dry and subtle. . . Other menus were ordinary. Not particularly delicious or unpalatable. If you want to pay $ 20 for a lunch buffet in Waikiki, you'd better go to Kaku Sushi on the third floor of the International Marketplace. We hope that the taste will improve when the grand opening takes place.
