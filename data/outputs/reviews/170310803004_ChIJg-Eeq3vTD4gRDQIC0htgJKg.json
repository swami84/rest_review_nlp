We tried the Calabrese, the one with truffles and the award winning pizza. Each one was delicious and kept us wanting more. The service was great too, family owned so supporting them (small business) is important.  The variety of wine gave our group lots of choices. Will definitely be back. 5 stars for the Gallucci\u2019s boys.",

They place a great deal of effort into the crust.  Generally I find that the crust is what makes the difference when differentiating between a good and a great pizza.  My wife almost always orders the Pizza Calabrese (and not just because that is our name).  I generally like their various vegetarian style pizzas.  If you like strong flavors, get the Citara, which has a strong anchovy and caper taste.  My other favorite is the Terra Mia.  They have a number of white pizzas.  One interesting one to try is the Sorrentina, which has sliced lemons (best during warm summer nights).  They offer a few pasta dishes.  The pasta is good, but the focus is on the pizza  The cocktail menu is interesting, combining classic cocktails with new ideas.  Try the Pulcinella cocktail.  They also have a good wine list.  For antipasto, try the Treccia, which is a braided mozzarella served with wood fired cherry tomatoes.  For dessert, my family loves the  pizza dough with nutella.  The service is good, the people friendly.  It is a welcome addition to Old Town",

We ordered the Frittura di Peace to start which was good except the shrimp tasted off. We had the Calabrese for pizza which was good, but overall was not as spicy as advertise and could have used a bit longer in the oven, the middle was floppier than other Neopolitans we've had.  Would love to try again but not sure if we will since it's not the cheapest place around.",

Loved that the owner stopped by the table. Fun to see a chef so excited and proud of his new restaurant. The service was a little too much, our plates were whisked away almost before we were finished with our food. Great, buzzy atmosphere and loved the oversized painted murals.

Only downside was that we were not aware of the GF crust up charge until the bill arrived. One of our party has celiac so she was very excited about the GF offering but was a bit disappointed that there was no mention of an up charge beforehand.

Arrived Sunday with a party of 4 and we're sat immediately.  The ambiance is great, as to be expected of a restaurant in Old Town.  To start, we had the insalata dimare (sp?) all the seafood was cooked perfectly not chewy but not undercooked.  We split the Gnocci entree,also, as an appetizer, that was equally impressive.  The pizzas were the true shining star. each one as delicious as the last.  Looking forward to trying every pizza on the menu.  Keep up the good work, Gallucci!",
