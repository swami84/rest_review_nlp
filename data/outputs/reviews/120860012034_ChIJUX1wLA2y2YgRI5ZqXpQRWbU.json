They have a lot of vegan friendly dishes, and keep the meats at chicken, fish, and turkey breast. You will be greated and personally served by Chef Dominique, a very engaging person that you can tell is passionate about what he does. The food came out in a very reasonable time and was excellent. If you love Banana Bread, ask the Chef to put it aside for you because it goes fast. Prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is pleasant. Meal plans are also available.
