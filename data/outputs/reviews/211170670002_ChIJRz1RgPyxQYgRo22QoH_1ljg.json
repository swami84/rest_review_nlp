Staff was amazing (thanks Clarissa for taking care of us, you were awesome and your drink suggestions were spot on).  Have really been  looking forward to the food and this place for a long, long time.  Man O Man.  Wow.  Started with the Goetta hush puppies and a dozen oysters.  Wow, blown away.  Great way to start.  Must say, the citrus cr\u00e8me sauce for the hush puppies was pretty dang awesome.  The oysters needed zero horseradish or cocktail sauce to go with as they were that fresh.  But this horseradish is likely the best on the planet.  Oh so good.  Moved on to the Shrimp & Grits.  I don't know what i was expecting but it was not this.  I literally have a hard time describing what it was I experienced with this dish.  So complex yet simple, robust but subtle.  Absolutely amazing.  So savory.  Highly recommend.   Next up was what I had originally set my sites on:  The Fried Bologna Sammy.  The depths of the flavors of this bad boy is unsurpassed.  A real delight to see and then taste.  I just can't explain it any other way.  From the outside to the inside, as i sank my teeth into this delight, my senses were overcome with satisfaction.  So perfect in every aspect and really made my day.  Also had the collard greens.  Also Amazing.   Great visit, awesome date day for Wifey and I.  Looking forward to the next visit.  Fried chicken gonna be next.  Thanks Libby's",

I was very upset to see the chef come out of the kitchen several times without a mask on and wander around the dining room past all of the masked front of house staff. I work in the hospitality industry and it is very important to me to give my support to local businesses who are taking these public health risks very seriously. It\u2019s our duty to our guests to keep them safe. I asked about the chef and was informed by the bartender that no one in the kitchen is required to wear a mask. This should be unacceptable for anyone who has the best interests of their guests and staff in mind. We were sad to leave without our food, but couldn\u2019t stay or support in good conscience. I sincerely hope this review will find it\u2019s way to the decision makers and that they will change their policy.",

Probably complying with applicable laws, but not taking COVID-19 seriously. In the meantime, we'll be taking our business to restaurants that are trying harder. (Still great food.)  (EDIT: Good response by the restaurant below. There was good mask-wearing by staff when I was there -- 100% except for one worker -- and we are all trying to figure out how to manage this pandemic. I maintain that more could be done at Libby's, but they're not ignoring COVID and I appreciate the candor in their response. Adding back a star for that. Food was great.)",

Such a nice balance of sweet with a hint of smoke during each sip.  We ordered the oysters, fried chicken skins, chef's chicken thighs, and the cod sandwich special.  All were well full of flavor and super delish.  Always, always, be sure to get Oatmeal Cream Pies!  We were too full after, so got them to go.  My husband was already hiding them from me at the table.",

So I was very disappointed when everything I ordered except the sides lacked flavored. The Goetta Hush Puppies could be on point if the used the hot Goetta instead of regular Goetta. Even with the provided sauce options there just wasn't a lot of flavor. The chicken skins were over cooked and under seasoned. Even salting them after they came out of the fryer would have elevated the flavor. The fried chicken skin and meat had no flavor. The chicken tasted like the bulk chicken you buy from a food service store and would have benefited from a soak in brine or buttermilk. The skin again had no flavor. The Mac n cheese was on point. Add a protein and I'd make that a meal. Garlic mashed potatoes\ud83d\udc4c!  It was all over priced. If everything was 3 dollars cheaper I would have given it 4 stars instead of 3. Definitely not worth the price they are charging.",

The sauces with it were tasty as well; a creamy, slightly sweet sauce and a remoulade of sorts. He had the chicken sliders and I had the shrimp roll. The sliders were the better of the two dishes. The chicken was tender and crispy with a nice sauce perched on tasty, tiny biscuits. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and sitting in just enough sauce to bring flavor without feeling heavy or greasy; unfortunately, the delicate flavors and textures were completely overwhelmed by a too big, too dry, and slightly stale tasting roll. Lunch and dinner menus are similar. They have a decent beer selection and a nice looking cocktail program.",

Started off with a beer for me, the Cheerwine Bourbon Slush for my wife, and goetta hush puppies. We were very pleased. I had the chicken sliders and fries, and my wife had 2 piece with mashed potatoes and green beans. Wasn't certain about the pairing of pimento cheese with the sliders, but was surprised with how good it was. It also came with coleslaw; creamy, crunchy, with some vinegar zing. Very good. Fries are slightly spiral cut into a sort of crescent shape. They are crisp on the outside, with a nice crunch, and soft on the inside just like fries should be. The fried chicken, breast and a leg, had very flavorful skin and was hot and moist on the inside. I didn't get to try the potatoes or beans, but she enjoyed them. Service was excellent. The waiter was extremely nice. No matter who walked by, if they saw a dirty dish that was no longer being used, they picked it up and took it to the back. They also had nice bathrooms. 10/10 Would recommend.",

After a meal here, you'll appreciate walking a block if you have to, since the portions are heavy. The inconspicuous entrance lends to a comfortable non-grand entrance feel. As soon as you get in the door, you'll be noticed right off the bat, since it's a small space. You can sit at the bar or a table if one's available. The bar is very attractive with it's live-edge wood and if you can't find something to drink here, you don't need to be going out. There is a decent collection of craft brews including Country Boy and a nice variety of bourbon.  Service was fast and personable. The menu isn't too busy. The goetta hushpuppies were in my mouth about 4 minutes after ordering and were delicious.The fried chicken was in my mouth shortly thereafter. Let's talk about that. Golden, crispy, and juicy. The batter wasn't overly seasoned; perfect for a hot sauce addition. Don't feel bad using your hands. I started off with a fork to keep clean, but turned cave man so I could get some of that crispy batter in each bite. I've eaten a lot of fried chicken, and this ranks up there with the best. The 2 piece meal came with green beans, fries, and a biscuit, but there are other sides. Let me tell you about the fries. They're like a marriage between a french fry, a home fry, and spoon. The shape invites itself to be used as a ketchup or a hushpuppy sauce spoon. Perfectly crispy and hot with no inter-fry zone mushiness. I'd go back for the fries alone. The biscuit was a biscuit and could be improved upon with regard to texture, but it was decent. My father had a fish sandwich and I wanted to grab it off his plate because the presentation was phenomenal. He said it was good, so I'll take him on his word.  All in all, Libby's is a solid establishment with solid go-to comfort in the form of drink, food, and service.",

Unfortunately food was negative 5 Stars it was so terrible....  1) We were enthusiastically told the oysters were amazing. Got a half dozen. (Only ate 1 each) The outside of the oysters had not been scrubbed properly (maybe not at all) and had sea mud, dead barnacles, and black grass/algae??? (like stringy spongy totally unacceptable debris) They tasted like straight sea water. (later found out they were 12+ days post harvest) Chips/flakes of the shell were mingled with the oyster because they were shucked \u201cpersonally\u201d by the bald gentleman that convinced us to buy them... Later found out he had been a pizza delivery guy for 10 years before this gig. Oysters need to be respected and should ONLY EVER be served by kitchen staff, not front of house staff. (This is a big no no if you know anyone in the seafood business)  2) My friend and I both agree that the only significant tasting note on the fried chicken biscuit was \u201cdirt\u201d. Way over fried chicken skin that was reminiscent of a pork rind with no seasoning.",

The restaurant has a very homey feel, and you are instantly comfortable. We had the goetta hush puppies for an app, and the Willy burgers for dinner. So, so good! If you love goetta, you will not be disappointed with the hush puppies. We interacted with probably 6 different staff members and every single one of them were polite and just geniunely happy.

Hostess said it would be roughly 1 hr 30 min wait. Around 7:50 we ask the hostess what position in line we were, so that we could close out tabs at the bar, which we had been sitting at since arriving. Upon asking, we were informed/noticed our reservation had been crossed out, and that several other parties had been seated before us. Hostess claims she called the name but no one in our party of five had heard. Manager sided with the hostess, but were told they would add us next in line. We were then told that a table of six was cashing out, and we would be seated next. We did not get seated until approximately 8:15. Food is great, and our bartender was very helpful with the whole situation. I had decided not to write a review, and just assumed that this was a fluke and move on. This was until I checked my credit card this morning. I had given the bartender who had helped us (unfortunately did not get a name) a $20 CASH tip, and crossed out the tip line on the receipt. I was very frustrated to see that despite crossing out the tip line, that a $12.00 tip had been added to our charge. I emailed customer service, who were very prompt and respectful, and they have refunded the tip that I was charged. Not a very good experience for us. *Will not let me attach a picture of the screenshot that Libby's customer service emailed me showing the tip.*",

We went with the fried chicken, chicken biscuit slider, goetta hush puppies, Mac n cheese and green beans. Hush puppies were killer, cooked perfectly and not dry at all. They pack a great flavor punch on their own and the sauces take it to the next level. Next time I'm going for the fried green tomatoes AND the hush puppies. Chicken breading was great, and since it's cooked to order, every piece was super tender, juicy and flavorful. Is it better than the eagle? I can't say they are a comparable product, but both have unique great taste. The biscuits were perfect, and the Mac n cheese while cold still tasted like the good times. The green beans were a pleasant surprise, thicker cut and seasoned perfectly. They unfortunately we're also cold, but that's a problem easily corrected as the restaurant finds it's groove. Friendly staff, fast service and a great first impression.",
