Every bite I took had a strawberry in it which is good but not something I like. If you are the mood for some Vietnamese cuisine give this place a try it's great!",

Glossing over Boston Coffee\u2019s 2 star review all I could sense was the immense loyalty and love they had for Neighborhoods Cafe.  As someone who has been following Phinista and their journey up to this point I can say, they have a different story to tell and we should come to understand that not every place starts off at 100% especially when it comes to building a relationship with the community. (You wouldn\u2019t think that girl at the other side of the cafe is your soulmate, without getting to know them first would you?)  As for my experience. I am very pleased to be able to enjoy the Milk n\u2019jas that I ordered when they were first starting off. Coupled with some Japanese style savory crepes. (Which is different from French style crepes. Ask the manager about it when he\u2019s not busy running around and working those kinks out. Pretty interesting) I will say it\u2019s nothing like the crepes I had in Japan. But we\u2019re talking about Japanese style crepes from japan. Yeah, there\u2019s gonna be a difference but for the fresh local farmers phinista gets their ingredients from it definitely doesn\u2019t lose ground. My group also got a sweet crepe and I personally can not comment on it because I\u2019m not a big fan of sweet food. My friends did say it tasted so good so you\u2019ll have to go off of their judgement.  All in all I\u2019m jealous it\u2019s not closer to me but the residents around Fenway will be glad to see how they tell their story after the dust settles and they are at 100%.",

        "caption": "Once I heard that Neighborhoods Cafe would be replaced by Phinista, I was bummed but excited to see what the new cafe would bring to the Fenway community. After checking out the new spot, I've had a chance to think through the below:  1. One thing that makes the Peterborough strip of restaurants so special is the true sense of community (in the center of a busy city). The restaurants that thrive in this area are the ones that foster this value and prioritize it. Walking into Phinista, the owner was working behind the counter but never made an effort to get to know the customers who asked about the new menu, ordered, and waiting for their food/drinks. When one customer ordered a regular drip coffee, I overheard the owner say they don't sell that. They warm up cold coffee with the milk steamer;  I watched this customer pour his coffee out in the trash. How can you be a coffee shop and not brew hot coffee throughout the day (especially when half of the community/your new customers are 60+ years old or students)?  2. The crepe was super delicious. And I'm sure that the ingredients used are fresh and made in house. But for two drinks and two crepes, it was $40. I don't think there was one coffee drink on the menu under $5 (and again, they don't even have hot drip coffee or flavored lattes). Also, they got rid of the classic bee stinger drink and sweet simplicity (chocolate hazelnut crepe), which the old cafe had as their most popular menu items. I also did not see a vegan crepe on the menu.  3. What happened to the amazing playlists from Neighborhoods cafe? Sounds like a small item but music makes a huge difference. Here, it felt like I was sitting in an elevator.  Overall, the main residents here are young adults and older folks. It seems like Phinista is trying to replicate their South Boston business model in a completely different environment with a very different audience.  Fenway doesn't need another Tatte, Cafe Nero, or Pavement. It needs another cafe that cares about the people it serves at a personal level. Where the owner knows the names of his customers and is willing to be authentic/unique but also familiar.",

The staff and management has always been exceedingly lovely, the cafe is aesthetically brilliant, the coffee is delicious, and the crepes are exactly like the ones I had growing up in Europe. Neighborhood's is one of the first establishments we thought about when covid hit as well, we hoped that such a essential part of our city life would be okay.  Today, I surprised my fiance with crepes and coffee that we ate on our porch while watching dogs and kids in the park across the street. I had time to relax and reflect. The coffee was perfect. He had a London Fog iced latte and I the house shakerato.  I had the Tuscan Chicken Crepe which was delicious and he had the Strawberry Patch. The whipped cream had melted in his but we had cream that I whipped up as extra, and it honestly would have been delicious without it.  Thank you, Neighborhood's, for your continued dedication to being the little something extra that makes this city a part of our happiness.",

It is hard to get coffee wrong and this place did it right. The order was prepared in a timely manner and all of the staff were courteous and helpful when faced with questions about the menu. We didn't order them but the crepes looked fantastic and tantalizing. Sadly we had already made our food plans for the day and didn't get a chance to try them.",

I went in with 3 friends early on a Saturday morning to get crepes and coffee on a day with fairly \"standard\" seeming business, a few people in line, inside seating full, but outside seating empty. We each ordered a different coffee and crepe and then proceeded to wait 50 minutes total before all 4 of us had our food and drinks. I was the first to order and got a crepe and a drip coffee, a drink that could have been handed to me as I paid; instead I waited 20 minutes directly in front of the barista and then finally made the first move and asked her if my coffee would be out soon. It took a further 5 minutes before she got around to pouring the drip coffee out of the carafe behind the bar for me. The food itself is okay, nothing special, but combined with the absurd lack of any sort of sense of urgency in any of the staff and the regular mistakes and seeming lack of training, it is a miracle to me that this place is still open. Not only do they need to invest more into hiring and training, they also need more inside seating, more crepe makers (only 2 currently which is part of the reason it takes sooo long to get your food), and price cut to multiple menu items. I would only eat here again if it was visibly empty and fully staffed and even then I would be wary of the amount of time I'd be taking out of my day for a mediocre meal.",

Shortly he took a couple of orders of breakfast crepes from the people behind us and started making them. We asked why are u making it for them. He said it was a mistake and gave us a look and completely dismissed us. I don\u2019t know how this place is four stars the food was horrible, the service was horrible, and the coffee was horrible.

They should have specified that the feta cheese was made from goat cheese as I don\u2019t eat this kind of cheese. The chicken Tuscan crepe was delicious and was topped with pesto sauce. The sweet crepe we ordered was stuffed with banana and topped with chocolate which was also quiet nice. A general comment on the crepes is that you have to ask for them to be cooked well done if you don\u2019t like it very soft. The staff are friendly and they have an outdoor area too which overlooks a small park.",

There are also usually fun seasonal options for crepes and drinks too! The only downsides to Neighborhoods are that there are only a few inside tables so seating is limited (and they're pretty popular), and the crepes are a bit expensive (though rightfully delish!) It's a great spot and I go there most of the time when I want to go out for breakfast!",

Great service, delicious food, and perfectly made drinks make this a classic place for all of the college and grad students in the area to come and unwind.  As someone who cannot stand the bitter taste of coffee, I can't really comment on their more traditional coffee offerings. However, their Bee Stinger (iced or hot) is absolutely amazing while delivering the caffeine that I often so desperately need. If you are feeling something hot, then try the London Fog. Essentially, its Earl Grey Tea but amplified to its fullest potential.  Food-wise, you can't go wrong with a crepe from here. Sweet or savory, they are all quite good and def worth the money. My three staples are the Tudor, the Billy, and the Sweet Simplicity and I have never had a complaint. All are made to order and the people making them are clearly masters at what they do.  Speaking of service, everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable. The atmosphere here is very much the type you'd find in a local college town coffee shop though I''ll note that the place is very jammed packed with people, meaning that you will most certainly have a seat.  Clearly, this place remains to be one of the better kept secrets of the Fenway area.",

You can smell the freshly ground, high quality beans before you even open the door.  The owner ties time to source fair trade and naturally grown products to serve their customers.  I really appreciate that.  They now have the Chemex pour over and my husband practically salivates thinking about it...  Additionally, they offer a gluten free option for their crepes.  Love them - seriously, get the Tuscan Chicken.  If you love pesto you will love this!  Want your crepe a little more crispy - you say the word!  Also, they have a nice clean bathroom.  I wish they had a changing station but the floor is never dirty so I put the changing pad on that.  The staff is very friendly and its nice and bright.  The sun does come in like a death ray at 9am if you sit in the front window.  They also have outdoor seating Its nice to sit there and hear the roar of Fenway and the Red Sox in the summer.",

The service, however, is abysmal. The staff spent most of their time gossiping and chatting with each other and a couple regular customers. The woman who took our order forgot half the things we ordered and then didn't put nuts in its oatmeal as requested. The coffee guy took forever to bring mugs and cream because he was talking and then forgot the sugar. When bringing our food, the crepe maker forgot which plate was which because she was talking up a storm, she even told us she was chatting. I want to like this place because it's local and cute, but the management needs to give the team a strong warning or fire everyone and start over.",
