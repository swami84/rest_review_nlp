Old delhi style butter chicken was our favorite out of all dishes. Aged basmati lemon rice was one of the best rice I\u2019ve had in Indian cuisines. Ohh if you want to drunk lassi type of drinks, make sure to check ingredients on the menu. Some are hard to taste any yogurt.  Overall, all curry based dishes weren\u2019t strongly flavored, so I guess it is good for anyone experiencing curry.",

The interior was kind of antique styled and the lighting was warm. It made me feel like I was in the old days. When we tried to order and threw the two simple questions such as if possible to change the spicy level and what was the popular menu to the server and he suddenly went back to the kitchen and take care of other customer. This seemed a little disrespectful to me so the star is 4 but the meals were so great, especially the thin naan was perfect texture. I want to try other menus sometime soon.",

Corner Delhi is better than any other Indian food we have had in many years. The menu is small and creative, the staff very friendly and accommodating, the food is freshly prepared, but most importantly the flavors exploded with each course. Triple Yum! We began with the Tandoori chicken samosas with cilantro chutney, fantastic. We then shared the Kashmir lamb kofta in green curry, Mumbai chicken Milanese, mango chutney and a naan(?). I highly recommend these dishes as well as this charming neighborhood restaurant. Of course a few draught beers help to balance out the spices. Enjoy!",

My partner liked the butter chicken but I thought it was too mild for my liking. We had drinks and when we got the bill it turned out I got the wrong wine, which probably explained why I hadn't liked it. We liked this place enough to go back a week later. Unfortunately, trying different menu times we were less impressed. The Tuesday Thali had nine tiny samples (vegetarian or vegan) in little cups, which made it difficult to combine with rice or poori. Most of those nine weren't outstanding. My partner had the steak, which was cooked well but overly seasoned with pepper. My chocolate cake dessert was disappointing - dry cake and the cardamom and rose flavours promised in the icing and whipped cream were extremely subtle. I did get the correct wine this time. It was busy fairly early on a Friday and a reservation is probably a good idea. We saw a family with young kids but I wouldn't call it a particularly kid-friendly spot.",

What did I just eat? Doesn't matter; it was heavy and overwhelming.  Tripped over Corner Delhi while searching for an open restaurant on July 4. And wow. Great service, great attention to detail (\"no fish today; it's a holiday and the fish market isn't open so we don't serve fish at all\"!) and terrific, well moderated food.  And fresh bread actually seemed to mean \"baked for you\".  They have a visibility problem and if you do happen to stumble upon them you might think they're just a bar ... so I'm concerned for their survival. But MAN did we love Corner Delhi. HIGHLY recommended.",

The lamb meatballs were moist rich and flavorful, I ate them alongside the samosas (hot, moist and fluffy, super fresh) and the Bombay Cabbie- a rye drink, and the Minty-Pinty. Both are delicious Indian infused recreations, the minty pinty was like a mint julep with Masala Spices- the spice worked really well with the sweetness. Finished everything with the Banana/rose/cardamom Lassi- delicious.  I absolutely recommend coming in. I walked around the neighborhood before going in, saw lots of options- I was glad I chose Corner Delhi.  I'm definitely coming back soon. Next time I hope to try the salmon tar-tar with chili and chutney.",

And as it was going up, you can tell that a lot of thought was put into the design, creating a cozy neighborhood spot for eating with friends, date night or pulling up a spot at the bar to meet for drinks after work (or in my case that evening, by yourself). Corner Dehli is definitely filling a hole in the neighborhood - creating an inviting space for inventive cocktails and refined indian food. They have a curated, thoughtful wine list and the gin / cucumber cocktail packed a spicy punch, which I loved.  The masala leek samosas were fantastic - complex flavors in a delicate crusted pastry. The butter chicken was rich and nuanced -- It was truly a lovely meal. Corner Dehli also seems to be adapting to the needs of the neighborhood, which I appreciate. The reason I hadn't tried it before was because of the prices - $30 for entrees is steep for a curry, even in this neighborhood but it looks like they've adjusted their pricing for entrees and now are including the fragrant rice in the entree pricing. Fingers crossed they consider a happy hour for those warm summer months when they can open the windows?!  It's a refreshing addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to going back!",

In fact, I immediately ran into some neighborhood friends sitting at the bar. The menu has just the right number of options and food was delicious, so fresh.  My daughter, who is not an adventurous eater, really loved the samosas.  The staff was super helpful and lovely.  I look forward to many return visits.",

We almost didn't even order desert, but the chocolate cake and coconut tapioca were stand outs and not too sweet. The space is really warm and nicely done so you wanted to just hang out and chat. Beautiful bar too, I would totally go just for drinks.",

No one else is really doing what Corner Delhi is doing; that is, a fun, sexy Brooklyn bistro with a solid wine and cocktail list, but rather than French, or Italian fare -- with which the market is already saturated -- Indian!  Aesthetically well-appointed, and a pleasant staff, across the board, too.  Food-wise, highlights for me were the home-style daal, wild mushroom masala, the chutneys, and the coconut tapioca.  Cocktail-wise, check out the Cheeky Monkey.  Pretty damned impressed.",

The food is very refined compared to traditional Indian restaurants, much more Brooklyn 2018. The pani puri appetizer is a great amuse bouche. The shrimp curry was flavorful and savory/sweet with the addition of mango bits. Interesting additions to traditional dishes. You have to order the carrot pickle, it's truly spectacular! I'll be coming back.",
