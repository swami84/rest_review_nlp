WhiIe waiting  for our appetizer,  they served us sour dough bread and whipped butter, which we saved a bit for the escargots. To our surprise, they served us a complimentary  wine which paired with the our appetizer quite well. It was the large seafood tower. It was a spectacular seafood centerpiece and a side of escargots. The escargots were seasoned  well and it was delicious, with lots of sauce for the bread. The steaks came in a while, and  by which time we had digested our appetizer. They were served on very hot plates. Don't touch! If you like ribeye, order the cowboy ribeye. It is 2x as thick as they ribeye and. Love oysters? the Rockefeller looks fantastic. In all, every dish was tasty. The desserts we ordered were wonderful, too.  The cheesecake was not your ordinary slice. It was round, with a softened cheese center.  The final dessert was a surprise: flambe Strawberries! In all, the service was awesome I believe we met almost all the servers. They worked great together as a team for our table of 7. Alan, our personal server, provided us with awesome service! He was quite attentive and delegated his help efficiently. Ruth's Chris always went beyond our expectations, and made this evening much more special for us.",

When he returned our rib eyes were in 3 seperate foil repackaging. He just handed each of us a bag. My coworkers had a feeling that the server didnt hand back the correct meal to the rightful owner. We did a 3 person switch after looking at our meat cuts!!! We addressed this issue, he did not even apologize. He responded with, \"Oh, thanks.\" When refilling water glasses and asking if we were done with a dish, they very rudely reach over you and do their task. I had a dish of cream of spinach which I wanted to pack in a small container. He did not ask if we were finished, he just grabbed it. I had to stop him, and all this other server could respond with was \"oh.\" Ruth's Chris needs to retrain their servers on how provide excellent service.

We finished our water and it wasn\u2019t refilled until after our dinner was completely gone. Both my sons drank someone else\u2019s water who had ordered coffee and tea. At first we had a woman server and then a man came out and started helping us. He helped more than she did. He filled our water, got us butter, wrapped our left overs, etc. I asked the woman server for a dessert menu but she took long so I asked someone else for one. That server got someone else to do it. By this time I was so disappointed with the service I asked for the bill. Instead of waiting for the server to take my payment I brought it up to the hostess to pay and she said let me get your server. I refused to wait for our server so they asked someone else to do it. Uuummm maybe Ruth\u2019s Chris Ala Moana employees should be more well rounded and everyone learn to do multiple tasks rather than waiting around for someone who can actually do the task. (Why can\u2019t the hostess ring up the bill, there was three of them) Just saying! My boys loved their steaks but the lobster was dry. Outback cooks a better lobster and I don\u2019t have an outrageous bill. Overall a disappointing experience! I will try Morton\u2019s in April!",

It took 40min to order cause she didn\u2019t show up even after we asked several times. (She didn\u2019t even say hi when we came in while saying hello to others with a happy smile. It was very obvious.) After all, we had to complain, and the manager and replaced server were great and professional. It was our last honeymoon night and my husband was so upset that he was about to leave. But the other staff made up for it. Excellent taste, nice atmosphere. Just watch out for a racist server(she had a long blonde hair.)",

I was celebrating my birthday and my whole table was offered complimentary bubbly, always a nice touch. I had ordered the cowboy ribeye (with bone) instead of the usual ribeye because when will I ever be able to experience the best of the best again?  We ordered asparagus, brussels sprouts with bacon, mashed potatoes, ESCARGOT and lots of bread to go with it. All the sides were wonderfully delicious and flavorful in their own rights. The only bump in the night was when they had mistakenly prepared a ribeye, instead of the cowboy. They ended up sending the ribeye back and we had to wait for them to cook another steak. I had ordered a medium rare, but it was a little more undercooked than the usual, most likely trying to speed up the cooking slightly. I didn't mind it since their meat is such a high quality and aged steaks. It was a pleasurable change of my normal go to and wether things go according to plan or not, the staff are ALWAYS so very accommodating to providing the best dining experience for their customers!  I would always recommend Ruth's Chris Steak House for get togethers.",

You don't have to make a reservation. The staff were also pretty friendly. But it took a lot of time to wait, so that's not good.  We simply ordered steak as the main one. I ate a lot of steaks such as New York steak and tenderloin steak. Lastly, I ate dessert. I ate ice cream. Steak lovers came to recommend this restaurant.

Our server was rude and cheeky and couldn't enjoy the food. Asian staff responded very quickly to non-English speaking clients. I was very good at English and out of the way, so I was very far from the standard response speed. When expressing that he could not hear the words at a fast pace, he also showed rude gestures. I've traveled to many places and talked to many foreigners on the job, but this was the first time I had a server of words and actions that did not care about the other person and was unpleasant. This spot will never go again and I don't want to recommend it.

As far as the food goes, steaks and seafood main dishes were on point. But then there was the asparagus. Who doesn't cut off the woody part? You can't eat it! My suggestion:don't order it.

The rib eye was delicious, melts in your mouth,  but had too much fat. The shoestring potatoes were over salted and over peppered and soggy , been standing too long. Other than those, everything was great. We got our free birthday dessert, that was very pretty. And the best part is they gave us a birthday gift - a gift card for $20. to be used for our next date. Will we go back? Absolutely! We love this restaurant. It's a tradition that we will keep.",
