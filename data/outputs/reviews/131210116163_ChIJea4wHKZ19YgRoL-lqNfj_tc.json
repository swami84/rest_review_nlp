You'll feel like you're lounging just off the turquoise waters of Arawakay Bay while you peruse the daily oyster offering and perfectly paired full dishes (no need to order sides, although they're there for those with bigger eyes). The portions were surprisingly massive for the quality being served. The strong influence across the menu was thai (green curried shrimp, coconut milk broth, etc), amisdt some Szechuan style ingredients (soy braised lotus root, for example). Despite some other reviews, the staff was especially attentive and thoughtful. I wouldn't miss this Asian fusion treat - definitely worth a trip around the block for parking.",

The bartender, I did not catch her name but she had long hair and had a very bubbley attitude, was doing her best to keep up with the bar and drinks out in the restaurant while the manager sat around and did minimal to assist! We ordered the appetizer sampler and it showed up very quick. We asked for horseradish and it never showed up so we had to ask again and the bartender finally brought it.

Chef Blake was kind enough to visit our table multiple times and made us truly feel appreciated. Serving staff was knowledgeable and most helpful. The seafood dishes have an Asian twist bringing new rich flavors to established menu items all worth trying. The Jerk Chicken was the favorite poultry dish. The house Margarita mixed with Mezcal is life changing.  The restaurant itself has a spacious modern design with warm lighting. Music selection was seasonal, appropriate and at the perfect volume level to catch the holiday spirit while being able to have a table conversation. Lastly, the covid-19 arrangements were well thought out and made us feel even more comfortable to enjoy the ambiance and experience.",

While the restaurant location, decoration, and service were great, we were both disappointed with our entrees and the portion sizes for the price.  My wife had the Halibut which was served in a seafood broth with vegetables.  I had the Lobster Roll with warm lemon butter and VooDoo Chips.  The Halibut portion size was very small, the seafood broth unremarkable, and the entree came with no side dishes. At $36 it was way over priced.  As a comparison, Atlanta Fish Market offers Halibut at $26 with a portion size that is at least twice as large and is served with two sides.  My Lobster Roll had a small portion of lobster (about 3-4 oz.) and consisted of a small piece of lobster tail with the remainder lobster claw meat, wrapped in a flat bread.  The home made VooDoo chips were okay, but the combination was hardly filling given the portion size.  Certainly not worth $30 by any means.  As an aside, I also found one of their signature cocktails, the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\", to be one of the worst tasting frozen rum cocktails I have ever had.  I would not recommend it.  Needless to say we do not plan on returning.  For anyone looking for a great seafood restaurant I would recommend Atlanta Fish Market in Buckhead, or closer to Alpharetta, Atlantic Seafood on Mansell Road.",

Truth.  While I'm on the subject, the rolls are sublime. Soft, plump density with a sprinkle or salt over the top. So good.  Not trying to detract from the rest of the meal, the other stuff was good. The challenges I found here was that their endeavor to locally source keeps their menu pretty limited. Not usually a problem unless you're wanting the Thursday special crab cakes on Wednesday.  I tried an order of tuna cubes appetizer for a meal along with a salad. The tuna cubes were sushi grade and quite good. Presentation was beautiful. I was afraid to eat it. The salad -- interesting taste but a bit overpowering.  The \"chips\" that come with the fried fish are an odd pairing. Big sticks of potatoes rather than traditional fries. Decent but not my favorite. They had good seasoning but lacked enough of it. The thickness of the potato seemed to absorb a lot of it.  Service was excellent here. The interior space is gorgeous, complimented by a well-stocked bar with a cocktail menu you can appreciate. Price point dining here is $$$. $100 for two with a drink each.  I liked it but don't know if I'd go back. The parking and traffic at Alpharetta City Center is aggravating, and this place doesn't make me overlook it.",

My favorite apps so far are the Tuna Cubes and the Snapper Crudo. I love how they have daily featured entrees too. I tried the Scallop feature Saturday with chili garlic, fried rice and grilled pineapple that was to die for. Everything we tried was so incredibly fresh and expertly prepared, you can easily see why this is a higher price point than most other seafood spots in the area. It\u2019s WORTH IT! Oh, and you have to admire the absolutely gorgeous aesthetic of this spot. It\u2019s really somewhere you want to spend the whole day/night - and we did! Cant wait to come back.
