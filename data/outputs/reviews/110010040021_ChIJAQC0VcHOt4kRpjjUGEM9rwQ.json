The fried fish dish and the feijoada was even worse and cold, but we were the only ones in the restaurant, is not that they were busy busy. As u can see for yourself, the food looks pretty suspicious. I got very disappointed and frustrated specially because my partner and I got an stomachache right after. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t recommend this place, but I hope it was just a bad day and that they get better, because we don\u2019t have anything good to say about his place as of right now.",

You get very generous portions of oh-so-fresh-tasting fish, probably enough to feed two people. Very generous portions too -- enough to feed two. . . for $12?? You kidding me? The veggies they serve with it are grilled in oils that add so much flavor. Oh, and get some of the pastries. They have vegan cupcakes and other traditional offerings. And the staff was from Brazil and incredibly friendly!",
