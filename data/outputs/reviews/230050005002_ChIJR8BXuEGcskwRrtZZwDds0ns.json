Right from the start we were greeted by the lovely and knowledgable staff about the food and drink options. For the beer lovers in your life this place is a must. The food, ambiance, and staff are all so welcoming and kind. Whether we had a request for more of their delicious grilled bread with the amazing mussels we ordered, or a staff member being kind enough to go through the playlist they were playing to give us the exact name of a song we like that played earlier that night (he went off the hummed beat, and got it right!). Their lovely staff is just one of the plethora of reasons to go back, it's just gilding the lily that they also have fair prices, EXCELLENT food, and delicious drinks.  I'm so excited to go back! this place is now held to the highest regard in my family as our favorite restaurant in Portland!",

Ordered a beey salad and the fish & chips to split. The beet salad was excellent, with pepita's and a white cheese (can't remember exactly) with balsamic dressing, but it was the fish & chips that really stood out. The chips were fine, but the fish was superb, very flavorful and the crust was perfect, crispy and flakey, and not soggy in the least. When the bill came, we realized that we weren't at Duckfat at all, but at The East Ender. Turns out that their outside seating areas are close together, and we weren't the first to make the mistake. The waitress was super gracious about it and explained that while the two restaurants were wholly separate, they had a good and cooperative relationship. In short it was a very pleasant visit for an excellent mid-day snack, and we'll put it on the list for a full meal some day when normal dining resumes.",

Again, we had a long wait just for someone to see we were waiting at the door. Then there was a lot of communication issues, but about what I don't know. We finally decided to just go sit at the bar. And had a great experience with Cody! He took great care in our drink prep (loved the Lemon Ginger Drop) and got our meals ordered and without too long we were enjoying our dinners. Pappardelle, Chicken Salad and a Burger. I'm not sure why there are communication issues with whoever is supposed to run front of the house. We've never been upstairs either. I just think with all the competition in Portland of fabulous places to eat, they should think about this detail.",

First off, some jerk douchey patron called me an idiot (per my significant other already inside) when I was looking down cleaning off my boots and missed the \"use other door sign\"  affixed to the window seven feet above ground, and commented on how I couldn't read. (To note, the correct door to use says \"lounge upstairs\" so it's a touch misleading, thinking that's the lounge door).  Slow service. There are six tables. We were the latest of four taken tables total (mostly parties of two). Got ignored for the couple that came in after us, no big deal. Finally got order in. Waited on drinks. The party with jerkface was sat a short while afterwards, ordered wine, and server literally went to pour it right away. Still no drink. Asked again, it was obviously forgotten. Bloody Mary made with fish oil or something, so it was gross, unfortunately.  Seemed overwhelmed with the four tables, now adding a fifth, so the overall feel was just that we were an annoyance. Food was okay, nothing special. Fries and Brussels Sprouts were actually pretty good. We were there because of the long wait next door, and cold weather. Last time we'll make that decision.",

As someone who's into veg/hybrid recipes, imagine my surprise that the tartare and burger are my favorite selections on the menu!  On the other, the service has been absolutely terrible, almost every time, in the 4 times we have been there.  Plus, you get the inevitable friends of the kitchen staff, at the bar, who distract the kitchen staff, and general lack of care in managing service and/or customer satisfaction, that make me want to go someplace else.  As someone who has worked in restaurants professionally, experiencing a restaurant that's MARGINAL, at best, service-wise, then seeing its staff congregated about the bar is a MAJOR turn off.  Does anyone manage this place?  I just spent 113 + tip at this restaurant.  I can spend the same at a number of other popular local restaurants, and receive far better service.  If this restaurant was smart or good on any level, they would have up settled us promptly on our chit, since on this an off night, and with the proper service for drinks and food, our base would have been 160+.  Ever wonder why other restaurants are killing it on a Wednesday, at peak time, when East Ender is practically empty?  Case closed.  You have to manage your service better, or you're done.",
