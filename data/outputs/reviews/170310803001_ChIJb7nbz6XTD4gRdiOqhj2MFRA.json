Our server Kelsy was friendly and very nice. Had a great upbeat attitude. Did great with our orders and made sure to check on dietary restrictions and allergies which we appreciated.  The food was unreal. Our chicken (the tenders and sandwich) were some of the best we've had anywhere in the country. Not kidding.  We shared a frito mac and cheese and we should have ordered 2 because it was gone in 3 seconds.  Our friend had the burger and she said it was just as good as anywhere in the city, small cheval and little bad wolf included.  Our drinks were strong and very flavorful. Our only complaint was we had to leave at 11 because of curfew (not uproars fault, city ordinance). We're making a reservation to come back next month!",

A handful of my friends and I dined outside in the tent. It was warm enough (if you sit away from the flap opening) with plenty of ventilation on a 25 degree night. They have blankets if you want them! No igloo petri dishes for me!  Safety: The staff was good about practicing social distancing and wearing face masks. I've seen some not so great places but felt confident about this place.  Food: Drinks were really good--especially the Old Fashion variations. Some of the group favorites were the fried chicken sandwich (LOVE IT), burger and the hush puppies. No frozen, overcooked patties and bag fries here!  Executive Chef Jamie Fischer (looked her up later) does a great job creating a simple menu that is full of depth.  The fried chicken sandwich was fried but then grilled for a nice char. I wished I was able to experience the full menu but understand they have to limit it based on the timeframe.  Service: Brittany did a great job handling our group and timing the service. She was super friendly, charismatic and accommodating to our group. I give her extra props because she wasn't just serving multiple parties and timing everything but running in and out in 20 degree weather.  Loved the experience overall and will continue to support so more local places like this stay in business! They have meal kits on a weekly basis and I can't wait to try it!",

Ambiance and environment was clean, friendly, and the vibe was pleasant. The food and drinks were even better. Opted for the burger and fries and I was impressed with the quality and taste value. Waitress did a fine job accommodating our party throughout the evening.  As point of reference, if menu items are no longer available, kindly remind your guests before ordering. For all of us, it was our first time and we thought long and hard about our choices beforehand to expedite the process due to COVID protocols. We were looking forward to a handful of items (Lobster Mac and Patty Melt). We discovered these items in particular were unavailable at the point of order therefore folks had to default to a third option. Besides that, awesome spot. Will return for sure. Thanks!",

The staff all wore masks, took our temperature, and had the tables properly distanced. No detail was left unturned as the decor inside is top notch. The ambiance inside is eclectic, comfortable, and modern. Our specialty drinks were on point! You can never go wrong with the strawberry basil lemonade. Britt our server was beyond professional and so friendly! With it being our first time dining there, we had questions about the menu and she had the answers. We ordered a bit of everything and shared. For starters, you have to try the Sally Mac\u2019s Bar Mix, Bread & Butter and the Gravlax Bites. So so good! The Squash soup with the house giardiniera hit the spot and was a great vegan option for us. It was obvious that the kitchen was highly experienced as the dishes that we ordered were so flavorful and the presentation was something out of a magazine. Would recommend the Roasted Chicken, French Onion French Toast, Pot Roast, and West Coast Veggrrito. There is something for everyone. The owners were present and busy walking around communicating with their staff and checking in on the tables. It was obvious they all took pride in the restaurant. We look forward to our next visit back soon!",
