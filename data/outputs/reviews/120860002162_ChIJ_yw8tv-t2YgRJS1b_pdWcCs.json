My personal favorite is the SALMON WRAP AND FRIES. I recently tried their TUNA WRAP and it was delicious!!  Although, the meal may take them a while to prepare , their customer service is outstanding. Their food is always fresh and kosher ! I feel more comfortable ingesting a meal from this place over a regular modern fast food restaurant. But that\u2019s just my opinion. \ud83d\ude42",

Clearly their own menu posted on their own website is $12.99 for cod, the salmon is $1 cheaper, so why would they try to charge me $8 more for a cheaper option? How is salmon even an acceptable alternative for cod? I really feel like they were trying to take advantage of me. Also on door dash you don't get the same options as in the restaurant, in the restaurant you get fries and a side, on door dash you only get fries or a side. So they charge you $8 more, don't provide any menu options, and you don't get the complete meal.  I can't even comprehend how they can be open when they can't deliver on fish and chips when they're called Bubby's Fish N' Chips. I was very excited for this and am now very disappointed.",
