I highly recommend this place for your seafood fix!",

Ill start with the Banana Pudding , some people would say that banana pudding is not a dessert they get at a restaurant. I say your crazy if you don't try it, simply amazing every time and a large portion! All their portions are larger than average!  I've ordered their fried shrimp and fried whiting  with mac and cheese, broccoli , fries and rice each time they were all prepared with the same quality and great taste. Broccoli sounds like a boring side but its a good way to tell if a restaurant knows how to cook , if you mess up steaming veggies you probably going to mess up a lot of other stuff too. With that said their delivery broccoli was steamed to perfection and seafood fried to perfection! Thank you to the owners and Staff of Catch 24 for your amazing food.",
