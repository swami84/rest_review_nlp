I really admire the idea to cook head and tail of one shrimp in two ways. Fantastic!!!  Time between dishes are just short/long enough. Waiters are gentle and polite. Price is great for a Japanese fine dining.  I wish the restaurant and owner could always have great business. Hope the whole restaurant can last for many many years.  Why not? Of course!",

Interesting selection of Japanese beers +in addition to sake and wine). We opted for the Omakase menu, which includes some warm items but is primarily sushi- and sashimi-based. Which is totally fine with me! The selections were \"traditional with a twist\": everything was recognizable, but most items included a small unique tweak that kept things interesting. Overall, highly recommended!",

Interesting factoid, they must be going under because if you ask for Soy Sauce, they bring you one tiny dipping dish portion, not the bottle, which we desperately needed to cover the taste of the food. I can\u2019t fogure out what they are spending the other $99 in profit on, but it\u2019s not fresh fish.  Don\u2019t waste your time or money on this place.

Also, he had expensive rare aged Japanese whiskeys. He was considerate to sell us the less expensive sake because our palates would not be able to discern the difference.

However, the slices of fish on the nigiri are slightly on the thin side which threw off the fish-to-rice ratio for me.  I also found the rice, while tasty, not to hold together well.  Also the dressings they use on the nigiri fish are too much which detract from the flavor of the fresh fish they use.  It does give the fish a nice glistening look though.  I also found that the creative toppings on the signature nigiri didn't work for me except for the hamachi one with jalapeno.  Service is decent, staff is friendly, and atmosphere is nice (quite a bit of space inside).  Full bar, with the standard sushi beer options.  This is certainly a place to check out if you like nigiri.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back, especially if I am in the area.  However, my own personal preference is I still like Ora and Juno a little more.  Fish here is just as fresh as Kastu, Ora, and Juno.  So chances are if you like those other places you will like Raisu too.",

The traditional nigiri was <I>amazing</I>, and so were the rolls.  If you have the cash, I would highly recommended going to Raisu.",
