The vindaloo had no heat whatsoever (vindaloo should be fiery hot), and the chicken was dry (how do you get chicken in a stew to be dry?   Seems impossible) and the vegetables tasted of nothing but salt and cardamom.  Even the baclava managed to be dry and was undercooked.  $70 for a wholly inedible meal.    Bummer.",

The food was average, the chicken was well done and was good quality chicken. The service was decent, the waiter didn't know much english but he was quick with refilling our drinks. There are two prices for the kebab plates, one is a small and a full plate. Apparently these mean lunch and dinner sizes. So small = lunch and full = dinner. When it came to paying the wait was very long. I was afraid that the amount that would be charge would be wrong and I was right. I should have paid around $16, but they charged my card about $24. It's not a huge deal but annoying. I will not be coming back.",

(I joke that I don't look forward to having kids because then I won't be able to justify going here for lunch so often!)  The Chicken Karahi is excellent. Get it with their fresh-baked naan. The Lamb Biryani is my default dish. The Tandori chicken is great -- comes with a side, too. The Chicken Curry is especially good when there -- the curry comes in a pan so you can enjoy the sauce before it soaks into the rice.  The owner is a great partner in conversation. He's always willing to talk politics and world affairs I'm always happy to engage him. I love this place (and I've gotten half a dozen of my colleagues to fall in love with it too.)  Note: the orders do take a little longer to prepare then at some places. But I gave it a very good because they seem to remember how you like it and make it that way for you. So it pays to be a regular. And I know most of it is cooked-to-order. When it comes to things like naan, that is worth the wait! (I just call as I'm leaving the office so it's ready or near-ready by the time I'm there.)",
