Every single day that I went to their store they kept asking to see if I brought my 7-11 rewards card and I kept forgetting, finally I signed up and accumulated some points, once i wanted to redeem the points it was another headache. Also, the new owners try way to hard to be nice, it seems so fake. I'm just going to start going to another 7-11 where they don't make you feel uncomfortable.",

They are already over priced by $1 -$2 compared to other local gas stations and 7&11 less than a mile away, DC & MD even in Rockville,they only $7.50. They said the tobacco company is to blame no its your store owner. The 7-11 in VA - Falls Church & Arlington is $6.00 & $6.50 I guess the tobacco co only increased in Silver Spring, MD. They have benches outside not because of 7-11 there is an office bldg & dentist office in the same bldg.",
