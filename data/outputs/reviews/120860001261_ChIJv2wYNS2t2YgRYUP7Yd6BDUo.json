        "caption": "My wife and I have traveled around the world and eaten at many sushi places and this is absolutely one of our favorite places. We ate here back to back nights and loved both our meals so much. We got a few appetizers, 6 different sushi rolls and a few desserts. We enjoyed every roll we had but our favorite roll was the Bea Roll. Excellent combination of sweet, spicy, crunchy and creamy. The best dessert was the fried Oreos, hard to go wrong with fried Oreos but these were delicious. We felt the prices were very reasonably as well, especially considering the fact that it is located in a 5 star hotel. We can\u2019t wait until we come back here!",

This place is amazing, our server was very attentive and recommended the Crispy Rice Tuna and Pork Belly watermelon that were delicious. We also tried the Tuna Tataki, Tuna Tartar, Salmon Pizza, Grilled Octopus and a couple of Rolls (So fresh). Would definitely recommend to eat there.",
