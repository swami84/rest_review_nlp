We have been here both in the day and at night and it was great at both times. The food and drinks are also really good, the homemade chips & dip.. DELICIOUS.  We came for drag bingo on Mondays and it was a blast. The staff is wonderful and super funny. We keep coming back because of them, especially Justin! He's super funny. All around beautiful venue, beautiful views, great food and drinks, and great staff. Check it out!",

Can't wait to go back, I love the space. Love all the plants. Its great. Did I mention fantastic food. These days a sweet rooftop bar is essential and so many are too posh or tiny and over crowded. This place has  got all I need in a rooftop runaway. Looks like there's even a heated rooftop area for the winter...nice.",

We had a couple of nice drinks, a french fry basket and a side of the corn. Everything was very good. The views are very nice as there is a decent portion of the Manhattan skyline visible. We had no idea going in but they offer rooftop movies! We will definitely be coming back to see a show!",
