Mine was the shrimp.They were tough, ovecooked shrimp; which btw, were burned\ud83d\ude1fon 1 side of each of the '6' shrimp in the roti. No type of gravey/sauce/moisture. No curry flavor, or any real flavor. It was bland.The roti was crunchy and dry for the most part. There was nothing to this at-ALL. Just disappointment.\ud83d\ude12 I was told (and saw for myself) the chicken, as well as the currygoat roti was also dry and lacking flavor. The only reason I gave 2 stars, is because the veggie roti; which also had a side of yams w it, did have a little more flavor to it. Not the usual flavor, but more that the other 3 rotis. Idk about returning after this\ud83d\ude0f",

I've never seen ANY restaurant with the tables so close to the door it's impossible to properly social distance if there are even 2 people waiting. A Latino worker kept walking in and out of the kitchen with NO MASK in sight. I expressed my dismay and obvious health concerns to the man taking the orders and also asked if the cooks were wearing masks. He flippantly responded that the unmasked man was just a dishwasher. I told him that I've worked in different restaurant kitchens and am extremely concerned about the health protocols not being followed. After stepping outside to obtain space and wait for my order I felt too nervous and returned moments later to tell him to cancel it because it's too hazardous and risky. He didn't seem to care. This restaurant's management needs to do better!",

I thought the change in ownership/ management would make the difference but clearly doesn't.  The food was not properly packaged in tightly sealed pans and because heavy items were stacked on top of each other the pans collapsed and all sauce and food spilled out.  The food spill leaked all over the flimsy used box and I wound up cleaning the halls and floors and throwing the food out. I also noticed the food was refrigerator cold - WHO DELIVERS COLD FOOD FOR CATERING (cabbage, yams, rice & peas and codfish) these items should've been hot ready to serve.   The photo shows the mess they delivered to my door and expected me to serve. The cabbage was raw like coleslaw - not cooked or steamed at all and the yams were also undercooked (still hard) and wouldn't have been edible regardless. So much for thanksgiving dinner... They lack professionalism and offer very poor customer service.  I've dined here many times over the years and always regretted giving in to my position to never return. I've tried to forgive their poorly run business over the years: not operating during posted hours; not serving the correct order items; ridiculously small portions; inconsistent and undercooked food,  always cutting corners... I eventually gave up bc it was clear sisters couldn't get it together.  But when both sisters exited the business I thought things would improve - but they are worse now.  To package a catering order the way they did- not taking any effort to properly secure the food was simply incompetent and unacceptable.  They cannot cater point blank bc they dont know what they're doing and don't care to get it right.",

Spicy but not overbearing, completely full of flavor. The coconut rice and beans and the yams were perfect sides. I also had Callaloo, which was my first time eating it. Maybe not my favorite thing, but not bad by any stretch. I'll eat it again for sure. I saved the Mac & Cheese til last (one of my favorite foods), and it did not disappoint. Just wow to the whole meal! If I had any criticism, it would be to add a few more vegetarian dishes to the menu. Will go back, no doubt about it.",

The service was fast and the price was very reasonable for the portions they serve.  All of that being said, the reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 was because 2 of the menu items that I wanted were not available \ud83d\ude1e 1 item they were out of at 1230 in the afternoon and the 2nd item they no longer offer as a menu item but just hadn't taken it off the menu- that was very disappointing but it won't stop me from visiting again.

To drink I had the Sorrell and lemonade half and half. The Sorrell has a similar taste to the lemonade. A twang like lemon but not the same flavor. Really makes no sense to do the half and half. I did it on a suggestion. Service was satisfactory as well.  Knocked off a star because the prices aren't the same that you're charged as what's in the menus located about. Crazy part, the server heard me comment on the prices and I still was over charge by 2 dollars. It's principalities about the money and not the amount. I didn't know until they emailed me the receipt because apparently they don't print receipts there and use a tablet to take card payments.  Not sure if the price discrepancy is enough to woo me back. I'm on the fence.",

        "caption": "Having been born in Harlem (1958) & coming  from a family whose background includes both Barbados as well as Puerto Rico, needless to say, we love our island food.  Upon returning to NY visit last summer, Sister's Caribbean was recommended by a friend.  I gathered 25-30 of us & met at Sisters' on a Friday afternoon where we had a PHENOMENAL time catching up w/one another, a lot of privacy, superb weather, excellent service & a variety of DIVINE FOOD (my favorite was the curried goat & oxtails)!!!  I am seriously thinking about returning there w/even more family & friends in August of this summer for a repeat performance. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place without a moment of hesitation!   - Wendy Flores (Chesapeake-Virginia Beach area)",

Prices are reasonable, but not cheap- the bill can quickly escalate as you add on the sides.",
