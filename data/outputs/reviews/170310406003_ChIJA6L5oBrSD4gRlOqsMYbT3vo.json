This was my third visit here within the year and it's always nice and quiet every time I come here so I get the best service from Tracy each and every time.  The salmon and tuna rolls are a great value and absolutely clean and fresh tasting.  I tried a bowl of ramen which appears to come out in a rather smaller bowl but it's definitely generous in portion and incredibly affordable compared to the other ramen shops I've visited in the city of Chicago.  Tracy is very friendly and checks on with you frequently.  You can't beat the service and affordability for the quality of food you receive. If you love a casual, non rushed, non fussy \"mom and pop\" dining experience you will definitely appreciate Rolls N Bowls. Tracey goes well above and beyond to give you an attentive dining experience and the food here has been reliably delicious and always fairly priced.",

However, the appetizer we ordered came out after I had already finished my entree, and our specialty roll came out after we had already finished our dessert. There was about a 15 minute lull between the two entrees in which one of us had food and the other didnt. The menu was inconsistent, the ramen just a bowl of 99 cent brick ramen without much care put in to it while the beef appetizer was like a painting on a plate.  The incredibly poor timing really detracted from the otherwise stellar food, and made for a disappointingexperience. 3 out of 5.",

Had to send it back and they still tried to charge me for the soup I couldn\u2019t eat because it was so bad. I asked to see the manager in order for it to be removed from my bill and the owner stated : \u201cif it\u2019s not salty enough for you start cooking at home\u201d and when I refused to pay Police was called. My jaw completely dropped when she accused me of being a racist trying to take an advantage of her just because she is Asian ! \ud83d\ude33 Unreal mind blowing experience. No wonder this place is empty. Left a $20 bill and walked out. Never again. If you like tasteless food and rude management that calls you names this is a place for you ! Edit: Few hours after this incident me and my wife both are shaken up and feel bad that someone would use their position of being a business owner and force us to pay for a meal that was send back to the kitchen uneaten - we almost feel robbed. It is not about the money, it\u2019s only a stupid ten bucks- it is about a really bad attitude of the owner holding you hostage and demanding the payment for the food you don\u2019t wanna eat.",

They're generous with the broth but generally I prefer eating the noodles only lol. This soup could use a little more flavor but it definitely filled me up \ud83c\udf5c",

The atmosphere is cozy, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the food is excellent. This is a quaint little Japanese restaurant in Lincoln Square; can it get any better? 10/10! Highly recommended. Will definitely be back.",

Typical variety of sushi creations but the Love Sushi Rolls are unique and camera ready. First Mexican roll that actually uses enough jalape\u00f1os make it hot. Extremely fresh sashimi Tako and Sake. One of the cleanest restaurants in the entire Square, too.",
