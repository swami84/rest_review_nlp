I have been dining out for almost 65 years. Remarkably this was the worse sandwich I have ever eaten. She delivered a not toasted roast beef sandwich. It consisted of some meat in between two pieces of very ordinary rye bread. Nothing else on the sandwich. No lettuce. No tomato. No secret sauce. Just dry bread. Ordinarily I would have asked for what I had ordered. I was unwilling to take the chance with this waitress. I have to say that the homemade potato chips were outstanding. They might be worth going just for that.",

As I was dining by myself, I found a spot at the bar. I was quickly greeted by Kaley with a smile & menu. I asked about the draft beers available & she even let me try a sample (delicious IPA free dive) Again i asked about a favorite menu item & she guided me towards the Smoked Turkey Special sandwich (delicious & enough to take half my sandwich for a treat later) The menu has so many choices of breads, meats, cheeses, salads & side dishes, vegan & keto options, homemade soups & desserts... It's the comfort food & environment I truly needed that day . My father has had an extended stay at Tampa General with lots of bad news & sad moments. After a long walk to escape such a sad & cold environment (the hospital temperature--all the nurses & staff are expectional & warm) I thought I would pop into publix for a sub (ZUDAR'S is located directly behind publix) I happily discovered this locals & hospital staff favorite casual spot. Please stop in & try this family run  restaurant with great tasting food for a reasonable price. Zudars has heart \u2764 and to me, that is priceless. Thank you to Kaley & I wish you all the best in your future & to the owner who took his time to come by & make my experience one I'll never forget",

Comments were made during that lunch of where Zudar's was compared to many of the downtown eateries (quality &  pricing) &  that they excelled. Zudar's being just off the core of downtown I offered it to the birthday girl to show her why I liked it so much. It is not as loud as many of the downtown locations, it has better parking, better pricing,  better service, more casual atmosphere. I am thrilled she enjoyed it & now 1 more person has been turned on to Zudar's,  & when she brings her sister then it will undoubtedly add 1 more. That is truly how a business grows by word of mouth.",

I had the Yankee (Rye bread, turkey breast, swiss cheese, cole slaw, 1000 island, deli mustard. $9.99). The sandwich has a generous portion of turkey and the rye bread is perfectly pressed.  The flavor, on the other hand, is nothing remarkable. The turkey is standard issue deli meat without much flavor but a lot of salt. French fries are nicely browned and rate in the mediocre range. Good prices and service make it worth a visit.",

Took a seat near the windows and the first person that came by to take our drink order apparently never did. The next guy did and we waited and waited and waited and waited. Never told of specials or the fact can get a flight of mimosas or flavors because they don't tell you. While I write this two people also walked out because they never got greeted or waited on. Finally took pur order and well who knows as still dont even have silverware. The ladies next to us had to ask. Extremely unorganized and lackadaisical. Even if and when we get our food this place is not worth it. Not even busy maybe 6 tables with people and 80% of place empty and now I know why. Bloody Mary is more like colored water and mimosa is actually not bad but love to have known can get a flight for cost of two mimosas. Also other tables if party is of large will be helped before a smaller one in everyway. Worst service ever !  Long story short waiting in here for drinks, food and even help is longer then waiting in a line somewhere else. DO NOT COME HERE FOR BRUNCH OR ANYTHING ELSE !!!",

At least 5 different employees walked past us without a word. They looked our way but, and I quote, \"that was not their job.\" When someone finally had the decency to attend us, they had no idea where our orders were. They were quick to charge us but then we had to wait another 20 minutes to get the food. At this point my entire lunch break had passed. Oh and let me add that the wait was endured through a temporature of 90 degrees because their AC seemed to be broken.

        "caption": "Bacon brownies. The sign had intrigued me and mocked me for two years and every time I went to Publix to do some light grocery shopping. No. I don\u2019t cook. You already know that. But I craft and serve incredible alcoholic libations. Isn\u2019t a Bloody Mary a meal on its own? Couldn\u2019t a cucumber gimlet adorned with basil and a sliced cucumber act as a liquid salad? If I only drink those\u2026 am I juicing? The sign bothered me. The deli says absolutely nothing in that corner. It is not ugly enough or pretty enough\u2026 it is just blah and there. Since I am observing the strictly-no-eating \u2013out-a-lot counsel of my irrational accountant post tax day, I had to grocery shop. He had also advised me to never go grocery shopping while I am hungry. What is a girl to do? I was starving as I held my ecologically caring reusable grocery bags. As my platform heel stepped out of Aurora (Yes, I named my car), a Shakespearean existential question was asked: To eat or not to eat\u2026 To eat. Imagine all the money I was saving by not going into Publix famished and depressed. I would have paid for cases of twinkies. I would have bought and carried out ho-ho\u2019s (no pun intended. My friends were not with me). I might have kidnapped Sara Lee, Aunt Jemima and Ben and Jerry. No bueno! I casually crossed the street and entered Zudar\u2019s. The insignificant outside is misleading. The place was packed. There was one table of two left untouched and ready for me right at the front door. Was this the deli version of Ciro\u2019s Speakeasy? It was two o\u2019clock and the place was a convention center for the hungry businessmen. Servers were running around taking orders, delivering food, answering phones and handing out bills. I tried to coyly reach the table in anonymity. It was not to happen. A table of six men (eating half sandwiches and a side of salad) turned and smiled. Up and down and up and down their eyes went. Had they confused me with Angelina Jolie? Maybe. I was having a really good hair day. I might have been pouting even. I knew the fascination with me would end the minute I ordered my food. The green-eyed foodie was with me so we ordered a mixed Reuben (corned beef hash and roast beef), a chicken parmesan sandwich, a side order of mac and cheese (because one can never have tried it enough. I want to be like a barista of the stuff. A macancheeserista.) We had promised to try the bacon brownies somehow too. Even when Zudar\u2019s was filled with costumers, the service pulled through. Those tables were turning fast. Within ten minutes we were eating our sandwiches and harassing one another picking out food from the other\u2019s plate. Great sandwiches. Huge. Wonderful value. The mac and cheese proved to be a slightly better version of the powdered Kraft one. Even the macaroni itself was a twin brother of the Kraft kind. Disillusioned. I asked for the brownies to go. It turned out that there was also one kind made with peanut butter and bacon. So we did order enough to sample them. I can\u2019t say if the experience of them while in the deli would have been any different. They were given to me individually wrapped in plastic wrap and they seemed cold and fudgey rather than brownish. Dense is an understatement. One tiny corner and the explosion of flavors left you baffled. The chocolate dissolves and you are left with serious bits of bacon and bacon fat slathered on the roof of your mouth. I believe these brownies are like one of those love or hate relationships. No matter how you look at them, when it is over you are bound to have a memorable aftertaste.",
