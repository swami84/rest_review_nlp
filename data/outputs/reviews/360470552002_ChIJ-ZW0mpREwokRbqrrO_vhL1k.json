Order the traditional heavy meals, such as chilaquiles, chile de puerco, the rotisserie chicken with rice & beans. Know that you\u2019ll do yourself a disservice if you order something like a chicken quesadilla.... You have a whole family here making cozy, comforting, homemade Mexican food, so don\u2019t order something basically tex-mex and expect it to be bomb.

And again they disappoint. I order a chicken quesadilla. This thing was the smallest I have ever seen come from a so called Mexican restaurant. It looks good but it's small compared to other restaurants. 2. I tried cutting into the quesadilla since I was starving and if you look at the second picture provided, you can see that the bottom half of the tortilla did not cut all. I was cutting at it for 2 minutes straight and nothing. How long did you have this tortilla for it to be this hard by now? 3. As I was starving I tried to eat whatever I could and within my monster of a quesadilla I found a hair!!! Is it arm hair? Head hair? Underarm hair?? Whatever and wherever it came from, it shouldn't be there! Threw it away as soon as I discovered it. 4. The chicken tasted dry and old yet greasy. And there was almost no cheese at all. Again a picture provided for you guys to see",

They explained the food was ready and that they were short a delivery guy and it would be about 30 more minutes, which would bring my order to a total of 2hrs and 30 mins waiting for food.  I asked can they do something since i already waited two hours for the food, she paused then asked do you want it? I replied are you offering a refund for the food? she paused and i just answered fine all wait....After hanging up i realized how hungry I was and i decided to drive there to pick it up (since she said the food was ready), I called back and told them not to send it out, i'll just pick it up, and they responded Ok.  Upon arriving the first thing i noticed IS THAT THEY SCORED A (C) ON HEALTH INSPECTION, I went inside and told them that I was here for the food, there was an awkward pause and then she told me they don't have the chicken I ordered!!!!! Mind you this is now 2.5 hours after I ordered!  I asked them why did you say the food was ready and LIE about it being ready for pick up and how it was just waiting for delivery!!! So then I asked for a refund and they replied they didn't know how to do it since I ordered via GrubHub...In my opinion this is one of the worst experiences I ever had, BETWEEN THE HEALTH SCORE AND THE BAD SERVICE I WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN! (PLUS 2.5 HOURS LATER THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO OFFER A DISCOUNT OR ANY COMPENSATION)",

Of course there is never any sort of manager around because people are to busy chatting in the kitchen, who knows about what.  Nobody in there has the decency go even apologize or recognize the customer. I do not pay play the race card but I guess since I'm not from their culture I'm left for last or not even considered as a customer.  This is not the first time this has happened. People hear especially the males are extremely lazy and take their sweet time.  I've been in this industry way too long and I'm well respected to be treated this way with such unprofessionalism.

The food wasn't hot, and the Avocado salad was something that they should be shamed that they sent it to a customer!  I ordered delivery for 3 chicken Tacos and a Burrito. I am surprised from how good the food was. The Tacos was really god, remind me of the Tacos I used to eat when I lived in Cali. And the Burrito was also delicious.I have never been to the place itself, but I can tell you that the food they delivered was great.",
