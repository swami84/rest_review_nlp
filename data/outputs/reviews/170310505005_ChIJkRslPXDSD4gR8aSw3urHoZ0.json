It took almost 15 mins to get through the line because the cashier only cared about the online orders. The customer in front of me finally got his food and was ready to pay but the cashier decided to make an online order instead of just letting the man who is on his lunch break pay and be on his way after waiting so long. To top it off, I ordered the medditeranean sandwhich which clearly states that it comes with chicken, to see that after the man passed it through the toaster, there was no chicken on it. I decided not to say anything as I knew it would take forever to redo the sandwhich at this point. There is a lack of communication and care at this location and it shows big time. I understand if you're busy, but simple communication with customers and acknowledging them goes a long way.",

One of the workers then took it upon herself to cause a huge scene. She singled my table out and started yelling at us telling us to get the hell out and that she would call the cops. No one has said anything against outside food before and she did not tell us prior that it was not allowed. If she had told us nicely or mentioned it before we would have been fine with it. Afterwords we all just left calmly. This behavior was completely unprofessional and I will most definetly not be coming back here again.",

Light skinned latino guy at DRESS is making sandwiches fine, when my sandwich comes up - mid process, he pulls out a long hair.  He pulls the hair off my sandwich, and kind of out of his glove - it was connected to his glove.  Then proceeds to finish the sandwich...  But he stops, and replaces the sandwhich.  Cool. Maybe he just had to have the thought process - i stayed silent.  He continues making the sandwiches with the contaminated gloves - my first thought would be to change gloves (Where did the hair come from?). He doesn't, makes a few more sandwhiches - mine is now on the fly.  expedited. when mine comes out, i asked him to change his gloves.  I am a little paranoid.  Not the worst thing?  I made sure to say thank you - which he ignored. Ok whatever.  Heres where im really surprised: He gets a potent attitude and slops together a sandwich with all the toppings in the middle? ...  I am usually pretty calm.  Not too picky. And I love potbelly.  And i have worked there. This dude doesn't know customer service, because I was just aggress-ed at for requesting a clean sandwich.  Void of hair. That's not extreme, and is not asking for too much effort. I didn't make a scene. I just got my money back.  Dude needs to be trained  He is the \"unperfect hinge,\" at this location",
