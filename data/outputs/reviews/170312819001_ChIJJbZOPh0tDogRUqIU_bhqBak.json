The first time I went, I had a coupon from the Burger King app and was told by the manager / owner of the franchise that they didn't accept coupons. I told him this was from the actual BK app but he insisted that coupons were not accepted. His argument was that they just opened so they weren't on Google yet which made zero sense. Not being on Google and accepting coupons has absolutely nothing to do with each other. Also, I had no problem finding them on here to write this review. This guy is just super stingy. They would've lost about $3 with my coupon and ended up loosing more than $20 because my girlfriend and I turned around and went somewhere else.  Went back another time because I was short on time and needed something quick. Their system was down and it took 30min to get my food, and the same stingy manager asked what my order was about 4 times when it was all written on the receipt that he had. After all that, I was late to my meeting and the food was barely warm.  If this location was more efficient and honored coupons, they would make a ton of money considering the profiles of people who work in the area. The manager needs to change his ways if he wants this restaurant to be successful.",

This girl walks up to the female coworker making the burger telling her that the onions come before the pickles and proceeds to take the onions off the burger and toss them in the container with the rest of the other onions. First that was really unprofessional. Second she did not change her gloves when she handled the food. When we brought this up to her that we did not want the burger the african american coworker was OFFENDED!  She threw her hands up in the air and told her coworker to make us another burger with attitude, We said no we wanted our money back and proceeded to tell them and the manager who refunded our money that we will not be back. Just freakin nasty!",

When we got our food , hashbrowns were nice and hot but biscuit sandwich was cold. Heard a lot of people complaining about waiting",

They seemed to be preparing orders in the order they were taken and no one seemed to be waiting a ridiculous amount of time (even during lunch hour). Now the cons; they have NO shakes or ice cream (despite them being on the menu). At least not yet. Hopefully they plan on getting that together soon. Second, they just had bags of buns sitting open on the counter between the register and the toaster which I thought wasn't the best set up. They should implement a better storage solution for that. Lastly, I ordered 2 cookies since they had no shakes. The cashier pulled out a pouch of cookies from a clear bin and bagged them for me. They were not only not fresh, but hard as a brick! I didn't even eat them. Again, hoping this gets better with time as well. Overall, I see that they are trying and it is nice to have a BK in the area. I will be back, just not any time soon. I will give this place some time to work out the kinks and get the error out of the trial.",

He should stand by the door as people come in and greet them or walk around asking people how the service, etc. was.  The employees looked uncomfortable also.",
