The rice of the Nigiri was under cooked, which also made the crunchy salmon rolls have a slight underdone rice crunch, it's not really pleasant, and really disappointing to find under cooked rice from a sushi restaurant. I do have to say the fish was not fishy at all and the salmon nigiri could have been better if the rice wasnt under. Not sure if I will be going back, especially for messed up rice.",
