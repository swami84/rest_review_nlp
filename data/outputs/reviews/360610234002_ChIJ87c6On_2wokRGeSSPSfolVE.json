        "caption": "I give this place a higher score because it is family owned, they are very nice and they let me and my friend stay there talking and eating for like 3 hours.But I need to say I saw there was a dead roach in the bathroom and some flies inside and one landed on my friends samosa where we was eating. So hmmm... It was only one girl there, her uncle was a cook there. She didn't try to kick us out after we finished eating, if anything and she kept saying if you need anything let me know. But for the most part she left us alone and she was on her phone. The place is VERY VERY small. It is a bit run down. And the way they cook is a little different then the Indian I've eaten before. Like I feel like maybe they are Pakastani or of another nationality. But I wouldn't known what's the official way to cook the food, I just know when I usually get Palaak Paneer it's not supposed to be red and green sauce mixed. The vegetable samosas instead of the dough being light and crisp it was a dough like used in a Calzone. Very doughy and some parts inside were a little raw still. The veggie mix in It was okay. None of the food was spicy at all. Like I want to like this place, I want them to be successful and have a lot of business. But honestly in the 3 hours that I was there nobody came in to eat. Only one couple came and I clearly heard him tell his partner, \"I'm going to order some samosas so I can use the restroom\", which by the way they have an \"out of order\" sign over the single unisex bathroom.  A group of 3 girls came in to ask to use the bathroom and the server told them sorry it's out of order.  People from the neighborhood are sketchy and frequently stand outside of it. This is because next door is a residential building with people who sit on their stoops. One guy came in to hustle and try to sell something to her. I feel like they should get one of those doors that needs to be buzzed open so as not to disturb dining customers. I think people order more for delivery then to eat in. Because the delivery guy was sitting bored on his phone the whole time until around 8pm I saw they started getting delivery orders. I would say go to this place a try if your dying for Indian, but I've had better. Hungry Bird in the Bronx is way better if it's your first time to have Indian food go there.",

        "caption": "A nice cafe style ambiance is achieved with a cozy L-shaped wooden bar surrounded by ten tables dressed in crisp, white cotton for those who want to stay.  The menu is traditional Northern and Southern Indian fare with plenty of vegetarian offerings.  However, the Masala selections are more varied than most of the places down in the 'Little India' area of The Village.  I found the Raita to be a bit sweet for my taste yet it's still tasty.  The take-out service is fast and packaged very well with plenty of the entre - one isn't drowning in rice, lol.  The highlight is the 12pm to 3pm Lunch Special menu: Veggy or Meat Curry and a few of their Masalas.  The entres comes with Jasmine Rice, Naan bread, Samosa (Veggy or meat), and the traditional condiments (Tamarind, Mint & Onion Chutneys) for $10.95 to $12.95.  What I really appreciate is that you can exchange the Naan for one of the other breads without a fuss.  The staff is pleasant and friendly.  In addition, they are very patient and helpful to those unfamiliar with Indian cuisine.  I've been waiting for an Indian restaurant to hit Harlem and I'm so glad that it's one with good quality food and service.",
