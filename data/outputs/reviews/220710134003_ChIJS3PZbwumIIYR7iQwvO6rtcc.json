At 12:50, the order went from \u201cbeing delivered\u201d to \u201ccomplete\u201d as though it had been received. At 12:55 my husband called the store to be told \u201cwe\u2019re closed.\u201d Once my husband told the employee to hold on a minute and explain our situation, the employee said the pizza was on the way and was marked \u201ccomplete\u201d once it leaves the store. Needless to say, my order was never received. I used the complaint option on the app to get a free pizza with a future order, but that doesn\u2019t help me now when I\u2019m hungry and have no food. *Update-got a knock on the door 40 minutes later. Didn\u2019t answer the door as the delivery person sounded intoxicated and I wouldn\u2019t trust the pizza at that point anyway.",

At that point, the Carondelet store will basically tell you there are no deals.  You can't argue because they are not set up to deliver to your location online.  So basically you are paying full price.  And when I tried to order and pay with a credit card, they said \"Cash only\" at this location.  Literally a scam to the fullest.

Now I'm not a man that gives many Google reviews, but I felt I had to leave this here to let others be aware of our experience. This was by far the worst pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Having tried domino's in several countries in Europe, I previously had good experiences with this company as the food tasted nice as well as being decent value. However, here in New Orleans, the pizza smelt almost as bad as it tasted with the cheese leaving a disappointing taste and aftertaste while the tomato sauce gave the feeling of colouring, flavouring and preservatives left in a can for 15 years. It's a pity because the service was actually good where we received our delivery quite swiftly, maybe it's because we were the only people silly enough to order here. If you're visiting from abroad and want to see what Domino's is like here... don't!",

The app said that my order was done and it was being reviewed for quality at 1:30 am. An hour passed and no pizza at my doorbell. I decided to call and it was impossible because they wouldn\u2019t answer the phone! I decided to go to sleep because it was already 2:40 am and gave them a last ring and they answered. The guy told me they had my pizza ready but they had no drivers! Like really?! Can\u2019t they at least call to let me know that! Give me the option to wait or cancel my order. I cancelled it and asked them to refund me. I was so upset because I had to go to sleep hungry.",

Do not order from them if in the French quarter unless you want to get ripped off.",

I let the cashier know that I got a notification that my pizza was ready for pick up. The cashier lets me pay forgetting to mention that the pizza wasn't ready or how long it would take. The pizza wasn't even made!!! The guy making the pizza was complaining every time someone came in and kept saying he was about to walk out the door. This whole time he could be working on orders, he's looking around and complaining. After waiting around for 15 more minutes, I didn't want to wait any longer. I asked for a refund and left without any pizza. Please do not waste your time coming to this location. I will never be ordering or coming back. I just don't understand how you can run a business like that. I rarely complain, but if this saves other people from going what I went through then it's definitely worth typing this message.",

I said how is that my fault?? I asked to get a discount because of the terrible service after going back and forth with the manager on the amount I was told & the issue of not placing my order, he gave me a $10 discount. When it was delivered to our hotel, there were no plates, or sauces even though I asked for those things in the beginning.

The last night of our trip we went in there and same guy was really friendly and our order was perfect and fast! I think a lot of these negative reviews should try to be understanding that this place isn\u2019t as well staffed as it could be and nicer and they would get a lot further. I recommend it!",

At 2AM still nothing.. so I called the store and they told me he was 5 minutes away. By 3AM, still nothing. It never came. I called the store the next day to find out what happened. All they told me was, \"Oh that order was cancelled.\" No explanation, no nothing. I expected the pending charge on my credit card to drop off. It never did. I had to call again today, a week later, to get refunded. I was put on hold for 5 minutes, then the guy came on the phone and needed my full card number in order to refund the order. So my information probably got stolen.. who knows. Whether the refund will come through, still remains to be seen. New Orleans is notorious for its horrible service, but I expected better from a franchise like Dominos.",

I honestly dont care but if the foods not coming I'll go grab something nearby or just go to sleep... I dont even want the food at this point and would like them to just cancel. Dont bs customers. If something is wrong then be honest. I'd rather an honest refund than a 2.5 hr lie fest of your delivery guy will be here.  To be honest if it arrived it would most likely be cold considering how long it took... I'm still waiting btw Order was 1115pm Its 2am... I could have walked to the restaurant and back 4 times in the amount of time it took to drive 10 blocks... #Hangry#dafuq",

Most recently, my pizza arrived with a knot of hair baked into it..  These things are not a big deal, but considering I pay for the extra sauces and have never gotten what I ordered during the Entire Year that I\u2019ve lived in the French Quarter, despite leaving messages for the store from their app and even calling the store to make sure they get the order right, I have no choice but to condemn this location :(  It breaks my heart, because i love dominos so much. They have gotten me through some rough nights and mornings; and for the most part they have always nailed it and delivered the meal I can depend on. But a Full Year of pure disappointment is too much for my heart to spare...  So, with a heavy heart, I must officially declare this particular dominos a HORRENDOUS LOCATION.",

Unfortunately it's the only one that delivers to the french quarter. 3 out of 5 times my order is wrong, and 4 out of 5 times they take over an hour and a half. They just delivered cold food, that's not what I ordered, over an hour after the fracker said the dude left the store, and then they hung up on me when I called to ask them to remake it.  I never leave reviews, but this place is unacceptably bad for so many reasons.",
