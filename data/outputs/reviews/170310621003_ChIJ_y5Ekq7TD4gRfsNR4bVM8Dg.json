Service (2): The place is very busy and the staff was slightly stretched on my visit.  Price (3): The food was slightly on the high side, but pretty standard overall.  Crowd (3): Everyone there seemed pretty normal and respectful.  Location (-): As a weekend tourist who was being driven around by my friend I didn't really get a good feel for the area.  What's good? - The breakfast food is great and they definitely put some care into it.  What needs improvement? - I would say that the dining area could use a little bit more attention in some manner.",

They were both light, fluffy and delicious, however I would go for the Lorraine next time. We also tried the scrambled eggs, the nuttella crepes and almond butter croissant, all fantastic. Washed it all off with their Inteligentsia filtered coffee( be aware that refills cost $1). The service was good but not exceptional, it felt a bit impersonal at times but in no way bad, hence the 4 stars. If you want a piece of Paris, visit them, it's worth it!",

I enjoyed the Paris Brest which is a special pastry and represents a bicycle race in France ... is Choux pastry with a praline pastry cream in between. The espresso was okay, could have been a little warmer and a little stronger. They could also reconfigure the order area to be less awkward with the couch abutting up next to it.

The caf\u00e9 is operated by its three young founders\u2014Erwan Le Nan, CEO, Audrey Naccache, Chef, and Styven Charton, Pastry Chef. The store-front restaurant is beautifully and simply designed to capture the genuine feel and essence of a Parisian bistrot in charming neighborhoods, such as St. Germaine-des-Pr\u00e9s, Le Marais, or Montmartre. The moment we walked in, we could feel the unmistakable French ambience: romantic background music, a sunlit reception area with hardwood floors, wooden coffee tables and inviting chairs, and the lovely Audrey, with her classic chef\u2019s uniform\u2014impeccable white apron and matching toque hat\u2014ushering us to our seats.  Maison Parisienne imports its flour and butter from France and one can definitely taste the difference. Their butter and chocolate croissants are rich and exquisite, with the lightest layers of crisp, mouthwatering flavor caressing one\u2019s taste buds. I have been a quiche Lorraine fan since childhood, and as a French cuisine aficionado, it is my signature dish to prepare at home. I have enjoyed quiches and savory tarts in almost every French restaurant in Chicago and in several restaurants in Paris. However, I can honestly say that the tarte a l\u2019oignon we had at Maison Parisienne is by far, the best I have ever tasted, from the light and flaky artisanal crust to the creamy filling, inspired by the sweetness of the caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs. I asked Erwan why they chose Chicago as the location for their culinary venture. He said the weather and the vastness and beauty of Lake Michigan reminded him of his childhood in Normandy. Spoken like a true Romantic, who immediately perceived and captured the poetic essence of our fair city, and the undeniable affiliation we share with France. I can\u2019t wait to return for a taste of Audrey\u2019s superb Boeuf Bourguignon. Vive la cuisine fran\u00e7aise!",
