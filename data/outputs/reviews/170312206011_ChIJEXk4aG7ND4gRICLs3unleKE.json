After all these years, I recently found out that they don't serve \"truly vegetarian, real vegetarian\" food till you ask about every fish/oyster/etc. sauce they could possibly be using in their food. Simply asking if the food is vegetarian will not yield an honest (or informed) answer. Don't assume that what you order with tofu/veggies is vegan/vegetarian. The new server, possibly the owner (super-helpful guy with glasses) was the person to enlighten me; a previous server who no longer works there, was the person who claimed food was vegetarian when it was not.  Now, I can almost hear my devout Hindu grandparents chiding me from their afterlives. Regardless, I will continue to dine at Dena, albeit with a much lesser frequency and with a much higher scrutiny on how they interpret my \"truly vegetarian, real vegetarian\" order.  5 stars for the food, -3 for the past misinformation, +1 for the belated but appreciated honesty.",

        "caption": "Well this is my 1st time coming to this particular Thai restaurant which is really close to Hermosa community despite being in Logan Square. There was some rave reviews about this place. So far the prices are fair and reasonable as well as the generous portion for Thai dishes. The ambiance is modest and NOT extravagant. I noticed they delivered all the dishes all at once which is somewhat of a disappointed. I ordered Dena sausage and the chicken Tom Kha but bit was all delivered in one session including my beef red curry. To start off I have to say the Dena sausage was fresh and delicious. The my used fresh herbs and vegetables such as ginger, onion and hot peppers slices and peanuts as a garnish wrapped with lettuce and cabbage with the sausage. Very tasty. Although question if onions are a native vegetable in Thai cuisine? The chicken Tom Kha is good but nothing spectacular. It has the traditional taste but they didn't put a lot  fresh basil leaves and fresh lemon grass. It's odd that certain Thai restaurants use tomato too in the USA. This is one of them restaurants and not really a big fan of tasting tomato slices in the Tom Kha or Tom yum soup. According to owner it's because most people who are non Asian don't like it like that so they have to cater to their orders. Sad. Last but not least was the main order of red curry. I ordered it with beef instead of my typical chicken I usually order it in it was decently delicious. What again was unusual was they used bell pepper which again is something I don't see in most other Thai restaurant. It was \"OK\" just odd to use bell peppers. It did taste like traditional red curry with the bamboo shoots and some basil. All in all it was \"OK\" good. I plan to come again every now and then. It is closer to travel than most Thai restaurants that is out of my way.",

I usually dislike these big versions of the egg rolls I'm used to, but this was appetizing and I was tempted to order more. The lad nar was flavorful and the portion was perfect. (Their noodles are soft, not the crunchy version) The beef noodle soup was delicious and sweet. They use pho noodles, which is a great vehicle for you to appreciate the broth. Our waiter was so nice, his courteousness made me smile! Would recommend this place and come back again.",

If the food had been good then the small portion sizes would have been a problem, but at least this way we didn't have to waste as much when we chucked it out. Overpriced for the lack of quality.",

Panang curry with rice. These guys love soups! Because it was not curry, it was a liquid. Again, with a few tasteless dry (buah) chicken strips and a bunch of green peppers (I bet if they could, they would change the recipe and put onions into there). And the rice. Oh guys, it was burned. And carefully covered with a layer of normal (nut burned) rice. In conclusion: NO. just NO. read it again, if you're an optimist: NO.",

The food arrives in about an hour, maybe less, always hot and I've never had anything missing or incorrect.  They usually toss in something for free like crab rangoon or those sweet chips.

When the order arrived, it was luke warm and there was just regular broccoli on the dish. It's also worth noting the portion size was quite small, maybe the size of a lean cuisine. Overall, for a one order of pad see ew and a coke, 16$ was way, way too much. Also, really regretted tipping up front. Boo, Dena Kitchen!
