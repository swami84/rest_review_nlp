Speaking of the pizza the texture and quality on these slices are pretty spot on their not jumbo slices by any means but I'm a firm believer in quality over quantity. If you around the area and you are either A.(Looking to refuel) OR B.(want simply a nice quick bite I highly reccomend you give this fresh new spot a shot) Solid recommendation.",
