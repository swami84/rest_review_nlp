Like drinking silky smooth honey with Huge smoke. I ordered ribs to go. It came packed with utensils, napkins, wet wipes, 3 different BBQ sauces, and my 2 sides (cornbread and coleslaw). Needless to say that I devoured everything like a savage animal. A place to surely swing by during my next trip out to St Louis.

After reading reviews of the lunch and dinner, I saw multiple reviews saying the food was underwhelming and the service was subpar, but all of the brunch reviews said the service and food were both phenomenal.  Coming here for Sunday brunch was very refreshing. Best bloody Mary I\u2019ve ever had, bottomless mimosas weren\u2019t made with that cheap champagne that tastes like vomit, the bartender/server was very friendly, service was fast, and he even noticed that we had a small portion of potatoes, said \u201cthat looks light\u201d and had the kitchen make us some more! We were one of two tables in the entire restaurant, so the atmosphere was great with it not being packed like every other brunch place. Would recommend for brunch!",

It was slow for a Monday night which does not bother me, but the drink options are scarce if you aren't a whiskey drinker.  We ordered the pulled pork nachos as a starter and were very regretful of that decision once it was brought to the table. It was tortilla chips, melted cheese, and pulled pork you can buy at the grocery store to be reheated at home......not only did it taste bad, it looked disgusting. They advertise it as nachos with the works, but there was nothing else on them.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich before seeing the nachos, and was necous for it to be brought out. I also ordered green beans and Cole slaw. The pulled pork I got was completely different from what came on the nachos. It was bland and ok. My green beans were undercooked and bad, and the Cole slaw is bland. Overall, wasn't impressed with my choice.  My boyfriend ordered the ribs, which where dry and bland as well. He had Mac n cheese and fries as a side. Mac n cheese was good and the fries were Wendy's quality. He wasn't impressed either.  Overall, neither of us finished our dinner or took home the left over. Service was slow for us being the only ones there ordering food. My boyfriend loves whiskey so the only reason we will be going back is for him to drink. I'd go somewhere else to eat.",

The two ribs were delicious as was the shot special which was a lemon drop. In my first two visits the wait staff was the same and they recognized me, even waved and said hi once when I was just walking past the place on the street. They are also a whiskey bar and their selection is extensive. The display is beautiful and I regret that I do not like whiskey. They also offer a short list of other cocktails which I ordered from and the drink was delicious. Over all I highly recommend this place. If I lived in town I would probably be a regular.",

Great food - I got the pulled pork eggs benedict and the creme brulee bread pudding Great service! - waiter was super friendly, on top of it with our refills, and did a great job explaining the menu. Literally everyone said hi to our table too, even the cooks My friends got their bottomless mimosas and they were very strong. 15$ was a great deal. Even their coffee was awesome for a bar (it was French press coffee!)",

Again, not the cheapest place to drink but fair prices for both whiskey and food.  We often get the sample for $38 and split it.

        "caption": "A \ud83d\udc8e! If a place executed either their rib smoker OR their whiskey menu as well as BBQ Saloon, they'd be worth a special trip. To execute both so well is astounding. They boast a menu of over 500 world whiskeys, from approachable to esoteric. Yet still make incredible happy hour specials like an old fashioned for $5. The ribs are among the best in St Louis and the mac n cheese is some of the best I've ever had. It's served like an ice cream, with cheese just dropping all over the top.",

He greeted us at the table answered all of our questions and cleared our dishes. It was like being at my Aunt and Uncle's after church having Sunday lunch. The outdoor seating with the string lights gives the feel of being at a backyard BBQ, while everyone kids and adults alike play games and have a good time.
