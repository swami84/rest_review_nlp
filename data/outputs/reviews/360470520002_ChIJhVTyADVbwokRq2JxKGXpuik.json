On top of the fact that the French fries were a complete soggy mess, the chicken orders tasted terrible and I felt sick trying to eat it--not sure if it was old or just poorly made; I basically spent $35 and threw away 90% of the order. I promptly called the restaurant to complain and they instructed me to call again in the morning. I was told that they couldn't refund my money, but would remake the food and deliver it at a time of my choosing (this was agreed to by the owner whose number I was given by someone at the restaurant). Overall, I called a total of 6 times to resolve this and I still have neither a new order of food nor my money back. The food is not worth the hassle and this poor customer service experience has put me off ordering from this establishment moving forward. If between starving and ordering from this place---#starvation.....thumbs down!",

Wasn\u2019t going to check I had to tell him to check for real and still he told me it was still in the store. He then calls back to say the order never printed so they never made it. That was a lie because he took my order number the first time which means u were aware of my order and told me it was in the store. So that\u2019s 3 lies already.
