I really enjoy the thursday night events because it is really hard to go to museums during the day if you are working. Also instead of having kids run around screaming and yelling it is more of a socialable event with 21 and up people. Plus the mesuem area is always fun to be around!",

My burger was cooked well-done when I ordered t medium. Everyone else\u2019s food seemed to be subpar for the prices. The fries were burnt/over-cooked, the fish and chips only came with 2 fish pieces, the fried pickles didn\u2019t really have a fried coating and the pretzel app was small and not very good. Our server never came back to the table after dropping off the food. So no one could ask for condiments or another drink. We had to go get him to get our check after waiting awhile. And did want even want to ask him for separate checks because we did not feel like he could handle it. Also, we were not informed of the specials when we sat down so we all ordered overpriced food compared to what was available.",

My friend called me and said the door woman doesn't believe they had a table waiting for them - which is fine, doing your job I get it. BUT I went to get our server and we went to inform the door woman that she was serving us at a large table and we have been expecting those people. The door lady persited to just argue with the server and said since no one told her there were any available tables, they can't come in. ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY DUMB?!?! YOUR co-worker is telling you she has been expecting these people and you're going to stand there and take your job WAY to seriously?! We left immediately so we can join our party and ended up spending over $600 across the street. Way to drive out more revenue. Disorganized, rude, and plain ignorant.",

One song I really liked and danced on one of those \u201ccouch top\u201d made out of cement/tile. Bouncer approached me very aggressively and yelled I had to leave. Usually at any place they will give you a warning or tell you in a nice way. But he was rude, I apologize I didn\u2019t know and even asked him if it was for real or if there was a chance to just get a warning, he said \u201cno, leave now!!\u201d. I asked if I could finish my drink, then my boyfriend and I left qu\u00edetly. We aren\u2019t trouble people. Earlier, I saw another bouncer giving another client a warning for smoking inside the place and it was all good. I\u2019ve never been kicked out of place and bc of dancing, ridiculous... now we now those tile/cement couch top are meant for who knows what. We\u2019re not coming back or recommending this place to anyone. We\u2019re from the neighborhood, this place is a no no for customer service. This place really needs to train their bouncers. There\u2019s actually something called having the right approach.",

Great fit for old town / Wells St. interesting decor all around, with one room themed like a wine cellar and another lined with bookshelves.  The menu has some good options and interesting takes on what you might consider traditional bar food. I went with the short rib cheese burger and it was excellent. The presentation was decent and the quality of meet was very good. We did nachos and Brussels sprouts as an app and both were very good.  The service was decent. The server disappeared for periods of time and did not have any knowledge on the wines or whiskeys offered, but she was very friendly. For have a wine cellar themed room, I would expect a more extensive wine list. They only have about 6 different wines. Also, they have an expansive whiskey menu, but then were out of the first selection we ordered.  Overall, our experience was great. The atmosphere is impressive and the food was very good. I recommend getting some good wines on your menu and take Bogle off the list. You have the clientele that will buy it in old town.",

I went here for my birthday dinner and even made a reservation ahead of time at the right location so that I could get a spot near a fireplace and when we got there they told me they didnt have my reservation. I dont believe that but I didnt let it sour my dinner. The ambience was great and so was the music. They spent a lot of money renovating the space and its beauty shows. The server was a little weird however and he spent most of night gliding in and sliding away from our table. My friend said he was creepy. I told her he probably either had worked all day or had a couple cocktails because he was happy. Overall I give Lady Gregorys a 4 because  have been here before and it was really wonderful and the staff were really great. The food is excellent for irish pub food and well worth the price. Its a great date night spot and girls night out dinner. I would not bring large groups here 5+ unless i called several days in advance.",

The good thing is it's one of the few places in the area that doesn't blast music at such a loud volume you can't have a conversation. Lots of beers on draft and a lengthy spirits book. Okay spot for a drink but skip the food. Deviled eggs were meh, cheese curds were good but could do without the cinnamon on top, chopped salad was meh and fish & chips were meh. Cocktails were just okay and should probably be a buck or two cheaper. After $86 I felt like I was overpaying for typical bar food.",

Went on a Saturday night and the music was way too loud and the AC was too cranked up, but would definitely go back for a dinner or date night. Lot of potential with this bar. My recommendation: turn down the music and cater to a different audience. With douchey bars like Benchmark and the Vig all up and down Wells St, there's really no middle-ground bars in Old Town (aka between a post-college frat party and being an alcoholic in your 60s.) You guys could reach a very real audience of young people looking for a fun time in a cool part of Chicago but are a little disenfranchised by the current choices.",
