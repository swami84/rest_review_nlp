Didnt even want to give you ppl a star. I do not tolerate disrespect when it comes to my mother and the cashier tried to disruspect her one day and lorddddd i lost it in there. Where do i even put in a complaint? Who is the manager? Customer service is HORRIBLE....worst location EVER!!!!!!!!! Dnt even want to go back to that place no more. You've lost a valuable customer, been coming since i was a kid with my parents and now im old enough with a kid to know right from wrong and the way your employees treat customers is wrong! Noone wants to be talked to any and which types of way. Very disturbing. Train your workers!!(especially the caramel skin girl, slim and tall) always have a attitude and is very very disruspectful) she through my change at me when i handed it to her.

What was worse , was that she began to have a violent verbal argument with the nice driver.  She began cursing him out dirty in front of the other customers.  Business is not conducted this way, and she does not represent your business in a good light.  That woman needs to be reprimanded or let go!

I see why my friends stop coming to this location.everytime I leave this place my day is just ruined from her negative energy. That's not how customers should feel after leaving a business. I'll never return to this location I'll just try another location but for now I won't be supporting this business because how I felt today wasn't acceptable to me.

As others have commented the Jerk Chicken (their highlighted item) is not out-of-this-world but their stewed chicken and curry goat are second to none. TIP: they have AMAZING fried chicken that tastes like an old black grandma cooked it for you. However it is completely sold out by mid lunch hour. As far as value goes, where else in the city are you going to find a meal that has you stuffed until dinner time for $5.25 (lunch special)? This place is awesome in that regard... One caveat, they have \"we deliver\" plastered all over the place but they do NOT actually deliver.",

I say be grateful for the customer base that keeps you in the money because although you may play gospel music and may go to church on sunday, if your attitude sucks and you're not grateful to your customer base, that money can blow away like dust in the wind, I will defintely spread the word about them !",
