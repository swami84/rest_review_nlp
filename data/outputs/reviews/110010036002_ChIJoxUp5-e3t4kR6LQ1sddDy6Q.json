I somewhat-angrily called the store after waiting for 45 minutes to ask where my order was. The manager was uber-polite in explaining that they had attempted to reach me three times, and that instead of delivering less than fresh food to me they would remake my order quickly and send it out with the next available driver at no charge. The pizza arrived shortly thereafter - the delivery driver was super nice and didn't expect to even receive a tip (tipping was the absolute least I could do) and the pizza was fresh, hot and tasty (despite being ordered at 11pm on a Monday). Great experience and highly recommended - keep it up!",

However, things are never so simple, are they?  To fully appreciate such a place, we must observe it from a more spiritual plane. Dominoes is a game of chance, representing both the randomness of the universe and our agency within it. We may not always want the pizza here, but sometimes, it's what the office ordered because it's cheap.  A reminder of our ultimate faith is worth way more than the temporal pleasures of 'good pizza,' am I wrong?  No.",

Throughout my life I have never walked into a take-out restaurant where the moment that you walk into the store you are accosted with bullet-proof glass that surrounds the entire take-out counter.  They even have small slots that you would see in some banks, so that you can communicate with the person taking your order. I think maybe years and years ago I saw a Chinese carry out place that had a similar set-up. Who knows, I guess they have their reasons.  Before I came in, I already had an idea about the kind of pizza that I wanted. I located the specialty pizza on their take-out menu.  I went ahead and ordered the Pacific Veggie pizza that included a myriad array of various types of veggies!  Peppers, onions, mushrooms and even my favorite black olives. It took them less than 15 minutes to cook the pizza and slip it through the little security window that was bug enough to fit a pizza box.  The young lady who took my order was very kind and the restaurant was pretty clean.  When I got home, I was able to kill off about 3 and 1/2 slices, before saving the rest in the fridge for lunch tomorrow",

UberEats and other new food delivery apps are doing a much better job of handling their business. I'm not sure I'd consider ordering from them again. Even for my past orders, it seems to take forever (usually close to an hour) for the deliveries to arrive, at which point the food isn't exactly as fresh as it should be.",

At 9:35 my pizza was still MIA. I live about 1.6 miles from the store. I called the store and sat on hold for a couple of minutes and no one answered. My pizza finally arrived at 9:42pm. However, I put on my order that I live in the basement in two different places and left the lights on. But, the delivery guy is banging on the upstairs neighbors door when all their lights are off screaming dominos. Thus waking up my now very unhappy neighbors. When I come out my house and tell him the pizzas mine he standing there confused and slightly reluctant at giving me my order. After this whole mess is finished I'm handed a box that has absolutely no warmth to it. Open my pizza and it's ice cold, hard, and you can legit tell by the cheese and vegetables that it's been sitting out for a while. An easy dinner that was supposed to take 35-45 minutes took and hour and 15 and left me sad and hungry.",

When I made my presence known, he treated me the same way.  I recommend that Dominos corporate retrain Mr. Hernandez In Customer service as well as the delivery team on customer satisfaction. Customers should receive their order in a timely manner. If there is a delay, customers should receive a call regarding the wait.  Mr. Hernandez was not concerned and could care less that my daughter was hungry.  After hanging up with Mr. Hernandez, I was scared for her to eat the pizza IF IT EVER REACHED HER.

I made an online order after waiting for almost 2 hours for my order I decide to look at the tracker they provide on their website. To my surprise the tracker said it had been delivered. I was confused of why it said that because in my past experience it did not show delivered until I actually had it in my hands. So I call them and ask them about my order. I gave them my name and told me to wait another 5 minutes for my order to be delivered. So I wait for another 40 minutes!!! I call them again and I let them know how long I've been waiting and that I called a first time. The guy passes the phone to his manager and the manager tells me that my order wasn't delivered because I entered the wrong phone number. I told him can't they knock on my door so I could have provided them with an ID so they would know I am the actual customer. Then he replied by saying, \"oh I'm sorry but we can't do that\" I'm just like isn't that's why you guys are delivery service!!! So you can knock on customers doors and deliver what they pay for????!!!!! And he wanted me to waste more of my time to place my order again!!! I told him I wouldnt be wasting more of my time on them. Ridiculous how they couldn't tell me about having the wrong phone number on the first time I called. Never ordering from here ever again!!!!",

After that, employee Fazalur took another roughly 45 minutes to deliver it. I don't know exactly how long because about 15 minutes after Fazalur allegedly left the store with my order, the pizza tracker said that my food had been delivered although it hadn't and it stopped \"tracking\" (if that's even what it really does). I called the store and told them the tracker said my food was delivered although it had not been, and the employee who answered indicated that it would be delivered in about another 5 minutes. About 30 minutes after this, Fazalur finally showed up. I asked if him if he had trouble finding the place, and he replied, \"uhhhh....\" That's literally what he said, verbatim.  Upon opening my order, I discovered that the pizza was cold (big surprise), the crust was burnt, the store gave me the wrong salad dressing, and the salad was low quality (the \"spring mix\" is all just iceberg lettuce, really?! Please get with the times and try romaine! It can't be THAT expensive, even for McDomino's!). I don't know what kind of \"quality check\" Mariano supposedly did, but in my opinion it was sub par. Pizza toppings were OK though cold, and surprisingly accurate.  I have been ordering from Domino's off and on literally throughout my life, and the reason it's been off and on is that I've been burned (no pun intended) so often. I have given many different Domino's stores many second chances, including the one on 14th Street NW in Washington, DC that I ordered from tonight and they all disappoint in relatively short order. Maybe it's time to stick with Papa John's, Pizza Hut, etc. from now on.  I suggest the company get its head (and any other body parts) out of the tomato sauce and stop giving customers a McPizza experience.  Maybe the pizza tracker should go the way of the old 30 minute guaranteed delivery time and McDomino's should get rid of it? They both create unrealistic expectations, apparently. Can employees manipulate the pizza tracker to make it look like orders have been delivered when they haven't? Hmmm....I understand being busy on a Saturday night, I used to work in food service, but let's not create unrealistic expectations.  Thank you for reading my rant and I hope this Domino's location can improve.",

We ordered a pizza this evening at 6:30 p.m. 3 hours later, we told the driver - who had driven to the wrong place for the 2nd time that evening - to just take back the pizza, at this point we didn't want it. Despite multiple phone calls, multiple confirmation of our address, two contact numbers, repeated assertions we lived 10 minutes away.  They still got it wrong.  The only bright spot is that the person we spoke to on the phone said they'd comp the pizza and refund our charge - but I will believe that when I see it on our bill. Throughout it all the customer services was rushed, impatient, confused and confusing. This isn't the first time this has happened to us at this particular dominos branch, but it will be the last.",
