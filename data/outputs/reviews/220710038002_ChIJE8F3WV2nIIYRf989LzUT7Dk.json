That is what I should have done. The service is very slow and the food is terrible. I had ordered fried chicken and waffels and they managed to screw both up. Who screws up waffles!!!!! I go to hotels and make my own perfect ones in 2:30 . Horrible and over priced !!!!",

Had the shrimp boil, but there are plenty of other places that have more tasty boils. The staff was slow even though we were the only ones there and they were out of dessert which is also weird since it was early on a weekend night. Disappointing, but not terrible. I'd suggest going somewhere else for dinner at least",
