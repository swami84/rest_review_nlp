Alllllll of their PO Boys are delicious too! Oh and those delicious beignets are a sinfully good dessert!  I was SO excited to visit the Gumbo Bros' new brick & mortar location, and it does not disappoint!  The place is cosy, with a brick wall on one side, complete with pics and descriptions of their 2 featured foods: Gumbo (\"a big bowl of southern comfort\") and Po'Boys (\"the best sandwich you'll ever scarf\").  They also have regular beer, root beer, and cold brew on tap.  For the layout: There are 3 tables (2 tall, for standing/stools; and one short, with regular chairs) lining a red wall on the left side. You order and pay up front at the back, with a peek-view of the kitchen (where they work their magic!).  If you're lucky enough to meet the owners, they are so so nice too, and very open and friendly!  (I'm also hoping for a return of the Rabbit Stew they featured once during their days at Urban Bites!)  Either way though, The Gumbo Bros is Definitely worth a special trip from Manhattan for, and that's saying a lot!!",

I\u2019ve been to New Orleans and had several delicious gumbos and have held my own in making some. But when I saw there was an actual restaurant in NY I was excited to try. I spend $30 on a po\u2019 Boy, a cup of gumbo and beignets. Fine - a bit costly but this is New York. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. The gumbo tasted like a burnt Marsala. Heavy on the bay leaf and cayenne. No flavor just spice (not spicy) and bay leaf. Over-all bitter and not enjoyable. The rice inside was cold and the gumbo itself thick.  You guys did me dirty with the po\u2019boy and gave me the tops of unripe tomato\u2019s. You could hear a thud as I pulled them from the sandwich (as they were inedible) and dropped them onto the tray. The fish was fried in what could at best be compared to fish fry that you buy at the supermarket. IThe beignets tasted like zepolis found at a pizza shop. I did not complete one dish. All lack luster and kind of nasty. One star because the man behind the counter was polite. Please don\u2019t go here.",

My review is based upon both going to college in new Orleans  and working in southern Louisiana so have had my fair share of cajun food. Cute place.  Counter service but that is OK it is gumbo and po-boys.  I ordered a cup of seafood gumbo, a shrimp po-boy, and a beer. The good:  lots of shrimp in both dishes.  The shrimp was good and tender. Unfortunately the good stopped there.  The bad: the gumbo was bitter, appeared to only have shrimp, little too thick, and too many bay leaves.  Seafood gumbo is a kitchen sink kind of dish for seafood but that adds the flavor.  It was bland otherwise and you should not be able to stand your spoon up in it. The po-boy was dry.  Where was the rich, tangy remoulade.  The French bread was good though. Look, wish them all the luck but need some spice.",

I'll list what I ate in the order I ate it:  A. Boudin\u00a0Balls which I renamed rice balls were spicy and fall apart juicy. I was shocked I enjoyed this so much because I'm not a spicy eater. After I had everything else I even had one more balls they were so good. One more balls, hahahaha, anyway I digress.  B. Hot honey fried chicken (sandwich). Hot, crispy and so so tasty. Like mummy made them herself tasty.  C. Seafood z'herbs gumbo was different. Like I said it was my first time trying...give me some time.  D. The fried green tomatoes with the accompanying dip was a savory,\u00a0delish treat!  E. Chicken and sausage gumbo. Now by this time I'm super full and eating out of spite. I kid you not. I'm not registering what's happening in my mouth and stomach.  F. The Peachy pig poboy or (pulled pork sandwiche) so so tender and juicy.  G. Braised (collard) greens I found extremely tart.  H. That banana pudding! My first.\u00a0You've got to get to The Gumbo Bros and try yourself! You MUST!  I. The New Orleans tunes playing in the background, so cool! Dem horns!  The Gumbo Bros showed us such a wonderful time! Adam, his bro, Kai and the rest of their team worked tirelessly to make sure we wanted for nothing! Platter after platter plus we left a full boat of beer.  Thank you so much to our Peter and Katey for putting together such a wonderful evening! You work hard to keep raising the bar and I for one feel really blessed to be on this food journey with you. Always happy to catch up with my fellow buds.  The End.",

        "caption": "Came here after fasting for my yearly physical. Usually under this circumstance I could eat frozen liver and find it delicious, but this food was such a let down, I'm writing a review to keep from crying! The lunch special of half a fried shrimp po' boy and a small seafood gumbo for $14 was so alluring. I treated myself to a sweet and fizzy root beer from the tap (they also had beer), put $2 in the jar since they bring the food to your table, and sat down, enjoying the soulful and hip music, excited for some comfort food. When the tray was placed, I immediately was struck by the texture/sheen of the gumbo - appearing to be less-than-hot and not well incorporated.  I hate to sound snooty, but if you cook, you know what it looks when the pot is not yet done. The shrimp in the gumbo was overcooked, like something that was too chewy, and made to cook longer to re-soften. Unfortunately, whatever flavors were ever in the shrimp were lost in the base, which tasted strongly of bitter pepper skin and celery. The po'boy was slightly better: lettuce and tomato were fresh and brightly colored, and the bread was decent. Again, the shrimp part was wrong: cajun season was too light, and breading mostly salty, the shrimp inside tasted pre-boiled and therefore not very much like fresh shrimp. If I had not been fasting for the last 15 hours, I might have walked out with my dignity, but I worked through the sandwich and most of the gumbo. Then I spent the rest of the day with that lump-in-esophagus feeling you get when you don't salivate enough to properly moisten and digest food, because the food was just not done well.",

The wait is kinda longer than expected, but it is worth it because the gumbo is super flavorful. The sausage is my favorite part, but the chicken is tender as well. Definitely go for the bowl size because the cup will be too little to fulfill your craving. ALSO GET THE FRIED PICKLES!!!!! YUM!!",
