I ate for two people as I wanted to continue to sit around and enjoy some more sake.  Ordered the ramen and nigiri platter!  Had a cali roll.  Two sake and a beer.  $50 total so definitely great value for the experience",

I decided to go again for New Year's Eve and the regular menu. I knew the service was hit or miss even when there are not many customers. My main problem after this dinner was more about the overall quality especially the sushi this day. The chirashi special is $37. It was not very special with not the best quality. The sushi rice was not great quality either. I also had a separate order of hamachi that was good. We always had to track down the help for service. No one ever checks on you. But then again I've noticed that at many restaurants in Hawaii. Overall I give this restaurant an acreage score. Go for the happy hour if you do.",

They have long table inside to accommodate big parties as well as an intimate patio and a long sushi bar rail. Biggest con I can see is parking.

Also we were fortunate to come for the late night happy hour menu which was awesome. Had some of the best sushi I\u2019ve ever had here. Highly recommend salmon avocado roll and the spicy tuna roll. The chicken skewers were also really delicious. To top it all off they offered $2.90 Sapporo beer mugs! The service was really great and the restaurant was clean.",

We walked away very happy with that decision.  The service is the only reason I'm giving this four stars - it was incredibly slow (but at least friendly).  If you have good company to spend the evening with (we did) you will not be upset with a trip here - the variety of sushi options was great, and the quality and taste were exceptional.  Highly recommend.  (Side note: don't miss out on the raw octopus with wasabi for an appetizer)",

We had to ask for water three times to different servers and finally got it after our appetizers came out. They never even refilled our water till they brought us the check despite multiple requests for water.  The food tasted very average and the price isn\u2019t much cheaper than other restaurants. There aren\u2019t many sushi roll selections. They charge 17.50 for udon noodle and that is the only noodle soup option on the menu. The noodles suck up all the broth and when we asked for a little more broth, they want to charge 3.50 extra. We spent 97 dollar here for two adults and one kid. We didn\u2019t order any  alcohol. We think it is pricy for its ambience. It is the worst experience in Honolulu. There are lots other good options.",

The staff even accommodated a change I wanted to make to the sushi platter I ordered, no questions asked! The food was also excellent. The fish was fresh, the rice was perfect, and the miso soup was rich and bright--much better than the watery flavor I seem to find most places. Overall, a great meal!",
