First and foremost, you cannot beat the price. We got a platter that fed 2-3, and as we're all bigger folks, I was a little concerned it wouldn't feed us all. But boy was I wrong. It was basically $10 each and we were all sufficiently full AND took home a full container of the leftovers too. We even got extra injera for free. And there's a great assortment of flavor when it comes to the cuisine. No two items will taste alike, but their flavors can blend together to make something new from the components. I was especially fond of the roasted beets, the collards, and the seared lamb. If you're in the area, check it out, it's worth the visit.",

I've never received good service at any of the Ethiopian restaurants in the area, but at Tabor they put in more effort - I came at an unbusy hour and they were still accommodating. The wait staff spoke almost no English, so that can make ordering hard, and if you don't know what you want to order here, you will have a very hard time. However, the food is very good, and they have the best injera I've had.",

But the energy was undeniable!  But, what stands out the most is the personable, attentive staff.

The bartender played mixology while participating in good conversation with us -- and the owner even provided complimentary shots!",

The food was phenomenal as usual.  This is a family owned business as far as I'm concerned, so having been in the restaurant business myself I know that it costs a lot to have many people on staff especially if the profit margins are low. There have been times that it has taken nearly 40 minutes to receive my food but that's usually when the restaurant is at full capacity, the wait for the food is still worth it as the food is always of good flavor and quantity. There is usually only one server who is also the bartender and that means you are not going to get their undivided attention during the busy hours. Even corporate restaurants with many servers have slow service when they are at full capacity and sometimes jeopardize the quality of the food. If you like Ethiopian food or like trying out different cuisine give this small restaurant business a chance",

The air was thick with incense when we went, and Ethiopian music plays in the background, so it sweeps you away from the rough street feel outside. The server is friendly and speaks very good if heavily accented English.  I start with all this to lead to this point: Don't let any of this put you off! The food is in a word splendid. We got the Baltimore platter and every bite was perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection, and bursting with amazing flavor. The meats were crispy, even on sauce, and everything was fresh, no taste of staleness or having sat under a lamp. This place is a hidden gem for anyone craving Ethiopian food.",

We were seated at a table that hadn't fully been cleaned. The server (only one working the floor at the time, as far as I could see) forgot about my husband's drink order, and took a long time to come around to get our dinner order.  We'd been seated at least 30 minutes by the time our appetizer (Veggie Sambusas) arrived. While they tasted great, the middles were still partially frozen. I called the server over to our table, and she literally told me that, no, they weren't cold in the middle. We had to insist that she put her finger in the middle of one to feel before she'd believe us, and asked that she bring out a fully-cooked, new order. She reluctantly took them back to the kitchen, but then brought out the same plate a few minutes later, including the sambusa she's stuck her finger in. At this point, we were so frustrated we decided to leave. We firmly but politely told the server we were leaving and why, and asked for the check for my husband's beer. She didn't understand, and eventually got her manager (another few minutes). He tried to get us to stay as well, didn't seem too concerned about the terrible service, and wouldn't bring us the check, said that our food was almost ready, and told us to wait, walked off. We left some cash for the beer, and walked out.  Awful service, would not recommend!",
