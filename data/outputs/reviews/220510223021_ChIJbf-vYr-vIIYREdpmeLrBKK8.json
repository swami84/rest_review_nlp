I got an email about a coupon and so I came to the Metairie location to use it . I actually had 3 different offers because I frequent jamba a lot !!!! Today I was informed I could not use any of them because the store was getting a new system . I got the smoothies anyway . They both didn\u2019t taste like they usually do. I can\u2019t help but to think this was done on pourpose. So. Very sad this store will loose customers over coupons that they themselves distribute and yet don\u2019t honor. I strongly believe the customer service alone will deter people from this location. If a manager reads this review I hope they find it both eye opening and helpful .",

When I entered the store I said \"good morning\" to the young lady at the register, she forcefully said it back, then ceased assisting me to help her coworker who was having issues with a machine that wasn't working.  She helped her by pulling out a portable steel table or fridge where the juicer was sitting to see if it was plugged up.  She came back to assist me.  As she went to make my bowl, I asked her to wash her hands.  Her coworker asked her what did I say, and she told her.  After she washed her hands, she started making my bowl and then took her fingers and scratched her head. She grabbed the inside of the plastic bowl with those same fingers. I immediately asked for a refund and called her out on what she had done. Her coworker \"Nancy\" became combative and defensive saying \"I should've just asked her to wash her hands\".  I couldn't believe they expected me the customer to babysit them on hygiene.  I have never seen such disgusting service and disrespect as I witnessed today.  You should try wearing gloves and a hair net if you don't know how to keep your fingers out of it while handling food products. -Signed Roz",
