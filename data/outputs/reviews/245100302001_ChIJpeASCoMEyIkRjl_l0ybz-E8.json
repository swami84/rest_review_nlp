This is the WORST customer service I\u2019ve experienced.... the lady that answered the phone first got very rude when I asked her to explain an item on the menu then hung up on me after she wouldn\u2019t explain stating \u201cUse Google to figure it out\u201d. I called back hoping to get someone new......Nope it was the same rude lady! I asked her, is this the lady that hung up on me a moment ago, her response was \u201cYUP, I told you to call back when you figure it out\u201d.. I asked why are you being so rude and she responded \u201cI\u2019ve been here all day, I don\u2019t have time to explain nothing to you\u201d!!!!  If the customer service is this distasteful I\u2019m quite sure the food is horrible & unsanitary as well !!!",
