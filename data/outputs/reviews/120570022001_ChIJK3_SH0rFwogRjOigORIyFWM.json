I also grabbed some cans of King State canned cold brew. Then I set my sights on the real reason for this visit. Sandwiches!  Gulf Coast Sourdough has a couple vegan sandwich options. One is a Falafel Sandwich. The other, and the one I eventually settled on, is a vegan Flyby. Flybys are essentially Gulf Coast Sourdough's Oregano and Olive Oil dough rolled out and filled with a tasty filling then wrapped and baked. The vegan version contains vegetables like onions and spinach with a spicy kick. It was so good. I loved the puffiness of the dough, with a slight tang and the final kick. It came together perfectly.  The loaves that I took home with me were also great. They were crusty outside, soft inside and had a tanginess that outshines any sourdough you can find in the store. The price is a bit higher than if you bought one there, but not by much. The taste difference made the extra dollars worth it to me.  Like sourdough bread, sandwiches, unique desserts and local drinks? Gulf Coast Sourdough is somewhere you need to check out!",

We got the beet tacos with cheese for appetizers and I got the lamb tostada. The lamb was cooked perfectly and everything that was included in this dish was balanced and delicious. I know it came with cheese, tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, beans, and a fried egg sunny side up. Also had fresh cut fries on the side which was a great compliment to my dish.
