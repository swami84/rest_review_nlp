We ordered the Molcajete Azteca, which came with shrimp, steak, chicken and a side of rice and beans reccomendation of our server. It was delicious! Probably the best molcajete I've ever had. The service however was not so great. Instead of being offered a complentary   appetizer due to the inconvenience, we were offered two sodas on the house. Sad I know. We also kept having to ask other servers passing by to assist our needs. They seemed very unorganized and not customer focused.",

They just serve terrible old food. I ordered tacos and they brought me te tortilla taco only with meant and nothing else inside. My friend ordered a quesadilla and the flour tortilla tasted old. Another friend ordered a chimichanga and it tasted out of a box and microwaved. For all this bad food we ended up paying $128 for 4 people. Crapy food and expensive:(",

Also the menu says the Mexican burger comes with \"guacamole\" however this is not the case. I was given a small side plate with old avocado slices. Clearly, we were unsatisified..

The drinks came in plastic while everywhere else there seemed to be a glass served, the food probably was cooked in Mexico and had it delivered, because in the end after another 30+ minutes of waiting for chicken tenders with fries for kids we asked for to go boxes and my husband went to pay to the bar because the server forgot he had to come and get checks, cards, etc and our kids were going crazy from being hungry and that waiting, we ended up with hungry toddler tantrum in the car and all of us stressed out....

Highly overpriced for the quality of the food.",

Certain items on the menu were not worth the price (ceviche). We would ask the server for certain things and she never brought them. When asked to speak to the \"manager\" the bartender came and did not state his name or title just said he could help but in reality all he did was say sorry but didn't make the situtation better.
