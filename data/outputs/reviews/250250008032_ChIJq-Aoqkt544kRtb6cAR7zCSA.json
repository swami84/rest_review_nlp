The iced oat milk latte was mostly all ice, but tasted good (I just wish you could add comments or modifications in the online ordering system, like \u201clight ice\u201d). A bowl that we modified into a wrap frustratingly had one or two very small pieces of tofu inside, so there was barely any at all. And in one of the bowls we ordered, there was barely any sauce / dressing.  You can\u2019t ever reach them by phone and the menu isn\u2019t explicitly clear about what is for sure vegan and what isn\u2019t, but luckily they\u2019re a very vegan-friendly spot with some really creative and nourishing options!",

The first time, the website said they were open for takeout, so I assumed I could walk in and order. Apparently that was wrong, and I had to order online. Okay, no problem, I wasn't in a rush. So placed my order and waited outside... for a half an hour in 90\u00b0 heat. I again assumed I would get a notification that my order was ready. I finally got tired of waiting and walked in  Apparently my food had been sitting there for a while. Whatever, I guess I know for next time. The second time I ordered online again. Picking it up was fine, but when I unwrapped my food it was a pretty sad version of what I ordered. I get a swami wrap, which is supposed to have rice and cooked veggies with sauce. This time I got some large pieces of raw broccoli, a few raw veggies, and a tiny bit of rice, no sauce. Pretty unappetizing, but I ate it anyway. Then the third time I ordered for curbside pickup (at the Cambridge location). Probably my fault for assuming again, but I thought my food would be brought out to my car since I had to give a description of it. I sat and waited for another 30 minutes with no food, so I decided to walk inside. And there was my food just sitting there... Apparently you're supposed to call them and tell them you're outside, but nowhere in the ordering process does it tell you that. I used to love the food there. I was a regular ever since the Brookline location opened, but at this point I'm starting to think I should just go somewhere else.",

Love their green goddess bowl, but I ordered a Thai Peanut Sutra this time, which was just fine. The spicy sauce didn't have a lot of body to it (this sounds pretentious and tryhard lol)--but it just tasted spicy and didn't have much flavor besides the peanut. One of my friends had a broccoli wrap another time a couple years back, and it was literally just broccoli, egg, and cheese in a wrap, and it cost $10 (yikes). It looks like it's still on the menu for breakfast (greens, egg & cheese wrap), but it's now cheaper at $6.  In any case, I still really love and appreciate this caf\u00e9, just be aware that some dishes are so-so. I will still be coming back because of the gorgeous setting and healthy food.",

The only suggestion I have is regarding seating: I went on a weekend for lunch and over 50% of the seats were taken up by people sitting on laptops, including singles who were taking 6-person booths to themselves. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for a cafe to ask single workers to take single seats, especially during the busy weekend lunch service. There were a lot of groups looking for tables.",

I know it's a \"vegan\" place, but having some more soda's would be a nice improvement. Diet Coke, anyone?  The bathroom needed toilet paper and a good cleaning.  In the end, I will definitely be going back for one key reason: the food was absolutely delicious.

The pillars are curved and the lighting is creatively decorative. The seats all have cushions and the back room is filled with comfortable pillows. The whole place is a great place to relax or have a everything meal. The food here is obviously Organic. I had a smoothie bowl and it was very refreshing. It was a little pricy for a smoothie in a bowl but paired with the atmosphere and Organic produce I'd say it's well worth it.",

        "caption": "Thanks for the response, sorry it has taken me so long to respond in return. The 2 stars was because:  1. Your menu and method of service is a bit confusing (I wasn't sure if there was table service or if I had to order at the counter and the item names are not that descriptive) neither of which are problems if your staff are helpful and explain the menu and process to customers. However, the person I met at the counter seemed to just want to see the back of me, answered my questions with unhelpful monosyllables and did not seem happy that I was reading through the whole menu even though there were no other customers waiting behind me.  2. When the food arrived there were further problems. I had the mushroom udon. The broth lacked salt, any kind of punch really. I know the concept is natural flavours and subtle flavours but, coming from India, I have eaten vegetarian food with no artificial seasoning with so much more flavour. I get a little frustrated with the idea that natural flavours means no flavour when I have eaten food that proves this idea wrong. The udon was overcooked, the sweet potato and bok choy were undercooked. All-in-all I left with the impression that the food was trying to prove how organic and artificial flavouring-free it was by being bland. Maybe I am just not your target audience. Hope this helps. Good luck.",

But the food was so. good.  The staff are friendly, even at the height of lunch rush. Online ordering is super convenient. The prices are reasonable, about on par for the area. The food is filling, delicious, and good for you. And they have wi-fi! What more can you ask for?",

It\u2019s a different vibe from their Central Square location - I would call that one more hippie crunchy and this one more zen, clean. My favorite is still the Swami bowl but Green Goddess is a close second. Their menu is a little different here. I\u2019m not sure if they sell their sauces but if they don\u2019t already, they really should. My only complaint is that they\u2019re not open later. I would think until at least 9 would make sense, even just given the population they\u2019re near (BU campus is right over here).",

The wrap was half the amount of food and mostly rice and beans. While the bowl version had lots of veggies and almonds and half an avocado, I had a small smear of avocado and barely any almonds or tomatoes. Some of the stuff that was listed (such as the red cabbage and feta (paid the extra $2)) wasn't even in there. Because they left all the goodies out, the taste was, well, exactly how you'd expect rice and beans in a wrap to taste: pretty bland. The bowls looked delicious and I think are much better value for money. I guess they assume because everything is hidden in the wrap they can skimp on the more expensive ingredients that actually give the dish flavor. Would have given 1 star if I had gone on my own except I saw that the bowls were genuinely quite good. 4 stars for the bowls, 1 star for the wraps.",
