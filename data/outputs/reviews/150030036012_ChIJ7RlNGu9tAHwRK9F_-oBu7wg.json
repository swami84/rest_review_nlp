Perhaps because I like spicy food, it's less spicy than I had imagined. However, the yam is so effective that you can enjoy the taste of Sichuan. The recommendation is Chengdu cool noodles. There is stiffness in the noodles, and the delicious sauce is entwined with spicy sauce and garlic. The rate is slightly higher for small boats. Noodles, water dumplings, etc. around $ 13. It's Hawaii. But it's delicious, so I'll go if I want to eat hot things again.

I\u2019ve visited every one of their store except Honolulu thus I was excited and a little worried that they may not live up to their standards as their other stores.  I was not disappointed at all. The dishes we ordered had the same taste, texture and presentation as the ones I had in their LA and Vega store. This is incredibly hard to achieve for Chinese food.  Though I was born in Chengdu but I had not visited Chengdu for many years thus I don\u2019t know if the dishes truly tasted like they are supposed to in Chengdu. However, I can say with confidence that their taste match those that you could find in Chengdu.",

Know how long it takes to throw noodles in hot water and scoop them into a bowl? 'Bout a jiffy.  They could have filled our orders in seconds, and we would have been fed and gone well before the published and CONFIRMED AHEAD OF TIME BY TELEPHONE closing time of 3 PM.

In other words, SERVICE SUCKS !  HOWEVER, just a few steps Diamond Head (East, towards Walmart) from this sucky service joint is the Urban Bistro & Bakery, where, we discovered, the service is FINE, and the food will land THIS superb establishment on your \u201cvisit again\u201d list.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Best Chinese food in Hawaii!  For the Chinese, eating should be the most important thing in life! Everyone likes to ask: Did you eat? There are countless words related to eating: eating tofu, eating a lawsuit, not eating, walking, eating a long, wise, eating and drinking... but these are not related to real eating. Nowadays, the restaurants in the north and south of China, the inside and outside of the Great Wall, the restaurants of all major cuisines should be full of dazzling, and there are countless street food snacks. However, from the variety, quantity, taste and popularity of gourmet snacks, it is still dominated by gourmet snacks originating in the south, especially from the land of Bayu. Among the eight major cuisines, only Lu Cai originated in the north. In fact, this is also a reason, personal ignorance: First of all, the property of the South must be richer than the North. Secondly, the history of the North is not a natural disaster or a man-made disaster. It is not bad for the people to fill their stomachs. Where is there so much leisure to the southerners? Study it like that.  For many Chinese people living overseas, eating should be considered the most painful thing. In addition to the city of Los Angeles that is full of authentic Chinese food, as well as \u5543 burger bread can also be a pro. Many Chinese people have gone abroad, and the local language may not be well learned, but the cooking skills are sure to advance by leaps and bounds. Fortunately, when I was in China, cooking was too much. When I came to Hawaii, everything was hard and self-reliant. Chinatown was able to buy soy sauce, vinegar, bean paste and other basic spices and spices, except that pepper needed from Chengdu. Bring Hawaii. Before the Hawaii, it was almost difficult to find delicious Chinese food. Most of the dishes were not made in the authentic Cantonese restaurant. The restaurants liked to mix some cooking and not as good as my Sichuan cuisine. The dish is not good enough to do your own business. You said that this thing can be done deliciously. Many so-called Chinese foods in the United States are still opened by Koreans. Some chefs who cook are also tmd Mexicans, and many Japanese ramen shops are all opened by Chinese.  In the previous year, Hawaii opened a small fat sheep hot pot restaurant with good environment and dishes. It was also a Chinese restaurant that could give Chinese people a long face. Although many domestic guests say that Little Sheep is not good to eat in China, it can't be opened quickly. However, Hawaii's Little Sheep business is exceptionally good and basically needs to be lined up. Why is this? Because there are so many Chinese living in Hawaii and Chinese people coming to travel, there are very few Chinese foods that come with them. I didn't dare to bring Chinese food to Chinese food before. The taste is second. The environment of most restaurants is too scary, and I am afraid to lose face to the Chinese. Whether in China or abroad, many Chinese restaurants give people the feeling that they are dirty and messy. They don\u2019t know that the operators are delusional. They are reluctant to make a good sanitation. Let\u2019s take a look at the restaurants of Japanese and Koreans. Chinese food fume is not a reason. There are also a lot of wealthy Chinese in Hawaii, and there are no people who have opened a good supermarket in the environment. The broken supermarkets opened by Chinese people are breaking through the rotten Chinese street in Chinatown, and many people It is almost impossible to get involved in this area. This is the image of the Chinese and their things to the outside world!  Last year, Hawaii finally opened a Sichuan restaurant with good taste and environmental hygiene: taste Chengdu. Although the restaurant is small in size, the dishes are quite rich in taste and very authentic. It is rare. Sichuan cuisine is very popular in Japan, but it is too Japanese, with Japanese sister paper to taste Chengdu, they feel that they are the best Chinese food they have ever eaten in this life. The taste of Chengdu is very famous in Los Angeles, and the business is very good. Every time I went to Los Angeles, I took a plane and drove directly to the front of the store to shoot a long team (\u2299_\u2299)b, understanding the difficulties of eating goods. So the taste of Chengdu opened in Hawaii, and I almost didn't have to cook at home. I visit several times a week, in addition to my own demand for spicy and spicy, more to bring guests to improve the food, O (\u2229 _ \u2229) O ~ Previously met some of the guests asked me: play every day Everything is second, every meal requires Chinese food! It used to be difficult to do before, but now the problem has been solved. Some guests travel in Hawaii for a few days, and almost every day they will taste Chengdu. Some people may say that they should eat local food when they go abroad, and they will definitely not eat Chinese food. In fact, it is understandable. People like me who have lived abroad for many years, and those big cities like New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, the first thing I do is definitely to find Chinese restaurants, especially Sichuan cuisine. In addition to the small variety of foods of foreigners, many things are really delicious. The second mouth is delicious. The third mouth is vomiting. For a foreigner who can eat bread every day, eat a meal that we think is particularly difficult to eat. They have already felt happy enough in Chinese food! Therefore, the heart of many people is the heart of the country, and the stomach is always the stomach of China!

We order takeout from Chengdu Taste once a week or so. Portions are family size and their food is reasonably priced. We love the sauteed eggplant, kung pao chicken, twice cooked pork, chengdu fried rice, and the mung bean jelly noodles! Very satisfied with the quality food and service.

This is one of only a very few chinese restaurant on the island that offers szechuan style food. I can honestly say that I love 95%+ of their offerings. I'd recommend the wonton in red chili sauce, boiled fish in green pepper sauce,  tender chicken with double pepper, tan tan noodles,  beef with double chili pepper, chengdu style fried rice, sauteed arden lettuce, and the braised pork. There are a few other dishes, but I can't remember the names. This place is worth it if you appreciate szechuan style chinese food!",

First of all, if you're not a fan of spicy food, don't bother with this place. I happen to love spicy food and, to me, even their spiciest dishes are only a slight tingle but just enough to whet the appetite and get you craving more. The mung bean jelly noodles are my favorite item, but the pork belly and dumplings in spicy red oil are also amazing. It's not a huge place, but it looks and feels clean and modern. I couldn't care less that they use disposable cups to serve water in and the service has always been fairly decent in my experience. I love the food here.",
