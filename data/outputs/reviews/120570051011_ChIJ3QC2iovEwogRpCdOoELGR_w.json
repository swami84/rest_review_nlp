Today, a week later, I walk in and am quickly greeted by Ronnie, who not only remembered me by name, but asked if I wanted another medium well cooked burger. He also insisted that we order from a table rather than from the bar. Ronnie's methods of elevating his customers experiences makes him a huge asset to this organization.",

Language was a barrier for some of the servers and they seemed to lack some basic skills. Not removing dirty plates. Not offering the daily special or soup. Just a lot of little things that take away from the overall experience. That said, you could definitely do worse for dinner in downtown.",

We stopped in for lunch on a Thursday and were surprised to hear that they had a themed buffet and it was Asian that day so we of course opted in for that instead of the regular lunch menu. The Asian buffet consisted of ramen, white rice, shrimp lo mein, fried rice, salad bar and a hibachi station with its own chef! Even the drink is included in the $20.99 buffet. Everything was delicious and I mean, I would do it again. I believe they have different themed buffets each Thursday and I just got lucky that it happened to be Asian that day. We've also had our company Christmas parties here and had many tastings and were always wow'd by the food. Their breakfast buffet is to die for as well. I mean, it's great food. Hostess and staff were just great. No complaints here and I'm definitely coming back!",
