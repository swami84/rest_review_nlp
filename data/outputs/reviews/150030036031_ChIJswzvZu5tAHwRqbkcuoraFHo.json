They also have quite a rather large koi pond that is well stocked with beautifully, bright colored and patterned koi. There are turtles and occasional ducks which also frequent the pond. The food is always ono and the portions will not leave you wanting. Covid19 may have altered their operational hours and menu but not their Aloha spirit especially when it comes to their appreciation for their customers. They offer specials for families and individuals for the holidays and even participate in cultural community events such as the yearly Okinawan Festival! The staff are always polite, friendly, knowledgeable and make you feel like you're ohana.",

Paid an extra $15 which altogether with the price of the buffet comes out to the total of how much it cost on the weekend with the crab and prime rib all you can eat.  Well with that $15 it wasnt all you could eat.  It was a one time thing.  On top of that guest over the amount of 8 people has the tips included.  Which to me kinda sucked because the servers know they're getting their tip already so they dont need to provide customer service.  Our service there sucked because he kinda seemed irritated until we was paying our tab.  Our tip came out to $44 which I dont think he even deserved",

I was so happy with the turnout. Fried rice was a tiny bit hard maybe the scrapings from the pan. It's alright, it was still ono. We got there a bit later than we wanted (not the restaurant's fault) so we didn't get to see the big variety of desserts! But the desserts we did enjoy were very very tasty. I loved how the prime rib station had someone there to help out. My husband prefers his prime rib cooked a bit more than it's usually served and they were happy to cook it to his satisfaction. The waiter we had that night was awesome always on top of his game! I should've gotten his name to give him full credit. Always refilling us and making sure we had what we needed. I love how we were seated right next to the window to look at the beautiful view of the koi ponds. I have now found my new favorite buffet restaurant! I would love to come back soon! Thank you for the wonderful experience! Also, we celebrated my birthday there and when I talked to the host over the phone he gave us a 25% discount for a party of 3! So always say your occasion just incase they have a surprise for you!",

Good food, we had the Saturday buffet, the prime rib was tasty and tender though fatty, the various fish was good, vegetables were cooked well with plenty of flavor.  The sushi was okay, it tasted like it was just past its prime.   It is buffet on the weekends and plated M-Th so make sure you are looking at the right online menu.  The restaurant is a place you go to for the food, the atmosphere is a little dated as in stuck in the 60's and 70's.  With a good refurbishing it could be nuce again. The one complaint I have is the restrooms,  they need a deep clean, some dirt had been there a long time. 4 stars for food, 3 stars for physicality of the place.",

The food at the floating restaurant event that we attended was ok. Potato salad could have been better but was kind of flat and had a little to much Mao in it and not enough other things to make it taste better.Chicken, Pork, Fish were ok, but nothing to brag about. The salad was ok but could have used more things in it. Over all the meal was ok but nothing to talk or make recommendations about. Zippys would in comparison be a better place to eat for the money! $35.00 compared to $15.00 at Zippys!",

The staff was nice when you could get them (to be fair, it was busy with the few service people they had constantly moving around the whole place). But a family member ordered a beer, the glass broke while they were taking a drink, and poured all over them. While the glass got cleaned up, no one brought additional napkins or towels for several minutes (we ended up hunting some down ourselves once it became apparent that none would be brought soon). So my father went through his meal soaked in beer. So all in all, it was satisfactory food (decent quality if a little low on selection) for average prices with less than satisfactory service. But the koi are beautiful.",

It might seem convenient, and the fish in the pond are nice for the kiddos but I won't be eating here again. Have had a few meals here because it's right next door to the Pagoda, where I normally stay but I've never left happy about the money I just spent. Kinda hard to explain but the food is just bleh. Got the buffet just now and they have the fewest selections I've ever seen for a buffet. And I thought the coffee came with the buffet. I don't even really drink coffee but got one as I apparently misunderstood what my coupon included and thought it was free. When I noticed the charge and questioned it politely, the lady went from someone who smiled when I walked in to snappy. No biggie, still paid and tipped, despite it being a buffet, and left feeling irritated that she talked to me that way. Was unnecessary and I won't be going back.",

The ambiance and staff are excellent. The selection and quality is decent. We went on a weeknight which is cheaper than the weekend. If you wish they have two crab add-on prices.  We paid for the more expensive king crab legs.  Unfortunately they were very poor quality both in taste and size.  Everyone else had ordered the cheaper snow crab add-on so we asked for that instead.  They were much better. The place is surrounded by a large japanese garden koi fish pond.  After eating you can walk around this beautiful garden and take pictures.",

Compared to years ago, their food QUALITY and QUANTITY was by far one of the WORST I've experienced.  The prime rib was dry, the crab legs were pitiful in size (my fingers were wider than most of the legs), only had 4 kinds of sushi, most of the other food looked unappetizing and the dessert... Hmmm I don't even know how to describe it. The only thing that was good was their poke and ice cream/yogurt... So if you want your money's worth, you would have to literally eat pounds of poke and a gallon of soft serve  and/or ice cream. Oh, and wait, did I mention that the carver does everything for the buffet (replenishes the other food, makes the sushi, etc)... With very few food to choose from and not too many people eating, if someone has to wait 10 minutes or so for a slice of dry prime rib because the carver is busy replenishing other food including the desserts/fruits, that really says a lot.  So I can now conclude that I will NEVER go back there to eat, again. #NEVERAGAIN #SMH",

When he finally opens the door and waves us in, he seats us at a table by the kitchen. The place is empty so I tell him I want a table with a view.Genius offers us a table by a window covered by a black screen. I refuse that table and settle for one we do like.  We head straight for the Buffet and we can't wait to sink our teeth into a juicy Prime Rib. But the Chef station is bare and I feel lost and confused as I spin around the room with an empty plate. The Bartender/ Manager informs me that it comes ala carte, as does the crab. I ordered the Prime Rib and crab anyway and was disappointed to find the meat dry; like it was cut hours ago and left out. Later I was told there was no crab and was offered the lobster as an alternative. But when that came and I bit into it, it tasted like ammonia.  They offered me King crab which surprised me since earlier they said they were out. What they meant was that they were out of Snow crab. So when that came it tasted rancid as well. My husband suggested I try the crab without the butter and it tasted better. I told the manager that the butter bowl she brought out tasted good, but the butter bowl that came out with the lobster tasted tainted. She apologized then disappeared behind the counter.  We tried to salvage the dinner so we went to the dessert table. I grabbed two slices of cake, one guava, the other chocolate and my husband went to get ice cream. The guava cake tasted like the slice had been sitting out to dry, probably next to the Prime Rib, and the ice cream was milk because the machine hadn't been turned on.  By this time we were done and paid the tab. The cost was expensive, the food was horrible, the service was bad and the atmosphere worst.",

        "caption": "I recently stayed for eight nights at this hotel in the \"Pagoda Terrace.\" I have traveled a lot and this was the single most depressing room I have ever stayed in; I advocated but was never able to achieve a room change. Here is my inventory as a fair warning to future travelers: 1) The pictures on the website grossly misrepresent the furnishings. The room seemed to be furnished by shopping at garage sales and thrift stores. 2) The carpet was old and looked dirty 3) The walls were stained and looked gross 4) I noticed three kinds of bugs in the room at different times while staying there 5) In a two room suite divided by kitchen and bathroom, one of the air conditioners was broken so one room was always too hot. 6) The shower water never runs warm; it cycles between too hot and too cold from the beginning of a shower. 7) The tub is so old it always looks dirty and there was mold growing under some of the plastic faucet fixtures. 8) The elevator was out-of-service off and on during the visit and I was on the fifth floor. For most of the stay I was told no other rooms were available. One day, however, to my excitement a front desk staff person stated another room was available and it had just been remodeled. I took the time to inspect it and it was in exactly the same condition; I could detect no difference at all down to the dirty, run-down condition of every surface and the broken air conditioner. This confirmed that my room was not the only problem. Travelers beware.",
