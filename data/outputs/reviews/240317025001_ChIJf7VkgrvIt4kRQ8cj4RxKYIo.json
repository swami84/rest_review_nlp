The rice in the mango sticky rice was so creamy yet chewy in the most elegant way. Portion sizes felt a little small but overall very tasty! Possibly increase portion and pricing accordingly ;)",

Food - same authentic Thai, although menu was expanded to include some desert and soup. The hours was also extended to 10 pm. More specific details. They don't have parking as of now due to construction next do, only on street. If you're not familiar with Silver Spring you probably would have a hard time to find it - look for Safeway and this place is across the street. My last visit I had Crispy Spring rolls and  Yen To Fu - seafood soup. This set me up for $18 I give it 5 rating although it's more like 4.8 now. Consider Ruang Khao and Charm Thai. Kao Thai is way overpriced to be here.",

Today, I wanted to stop by to see what the lunch specials were.; but before I entered the restaurant, I stopped in front to check my phone.  A couple of feet away, there was a man and woman sitting on the steps having a conversation. I can hear the woman asking if \"you have a problem with me?\" I ignore her thinking that she is talking to the man. A few minutes later, she is in MY face asking if I had a problem with her? I am puzzled because I have never seen this woman a day in my life. I let her know that I am a customer. She then asks if I work at the establishment, to which I replied that I do not. Her response was, \"you're lying!\" I don't want any trouble, I just want to get my food and get the hell out of there, but she prevents me from entering the restaurant, accusing me of lying to her. She then opens the door and shoves me into the restaurant spewing obscenities. Once inside the restaurant, I ask the gentleman behind the register to call the police because the woman outside assaulted me. His response was, \"I have nothing to do with that. If you want to call the police you can do that from your own phone.\" I'm upset at this point and I ask, \"did you not see that woman shove me in here? Of course it's your business! She is harassing customers in front of your establishment!\" The restaurant worker repeats himself saying, \"we don't want to involve the police, do you understand that?\" I say all this to say that I have been a REGULAR of this establishment since 2008. I expected a little more from the restaurant worker instead of just a shrug. I am Asian, by the way. Now had I been a WHITE woman who had gotten assaulted, I am QUITE sure they would have called the police on my behalf and at least ACTED like they cared...  I've attached pics of the assailant.  So if you see her, beware...she is very hostile and very violent.",

Idk if they pre-made the noodles and cook the chicken per order, but when my dish came out it wasn't all the same temp. The chicken was also kind of rubbery. My friend ordered the papaya salad with crab meat and was served a salad with an undercooked 1/4 crab IN THE SHELL. He was expecting the crab MEAT to just be in the dish.",

After nearly giving up on Thai food on the East Coast, finally something akin to the awesome hole-in-the-wall Thai places I used to haunt back home on the West Coast! This place has everything you really want and need - AUTHENTIC, FLAVORFUL food (they passed my Pad Thai test \u2014 I can taste the tamarind!), low prices, clean, and quick. There are many options - a lunch bar with pre-made dishes that looked hot, fresh, and tasty; a menu with a decent number of things to choose from; and then some \u2018home-made\u2019 grab-n-go items that are awesome and authentic! The decor is simple, but it seems like it is being upgraded gradually as they get this business up and running. The family running the place are really nice, as well.  I\u2019ll be back again soon. :)",

They also have the usual fish or chicken curries,  noodle soups, and a variety of sausage and rice dishes from the local community. There is not much atmosphere, it is a simple to go counter with about five rickety old tables to sit at with your styrofoam plates if dining in. But the food is excellent, the service is friendly, and the price is right.  If you like authentic food like you might get from the street vendors or markets in Thailand, give this place a try!",
