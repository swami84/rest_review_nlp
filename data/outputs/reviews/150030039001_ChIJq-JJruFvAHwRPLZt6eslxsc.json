I was disappointed that they didn't have uni for the bone marrow; they substituted a saffron butter, which worked really well with it. The lamb was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend it. I thought the sauce could have been more intensely flavored with more spices, but it was still delicious. The custard of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was so good, but I thought the cherry compote on top subtracted instead of added to the dish. Overall, I really enjoyed the food, and will definitely be back.",

Wait staff and management are incredibly friendly and accommodating. For appetizers, we had the tako qhich was very meaty and dense and delicious.  Also, their brussel sprouts are the tastiest I have ever had anywhere!!!!!  We also had the clams and sausage with bruschetta.  The sausage was amazing.  For the entr\u00e9e, I had the Australian lamb and substituted their curry cauliflower puree for the potatoes and the flavor combo was FANTASTIC!! Their iced black tea with black currant is tasty and refreshing, as well.  We will definitely be coming back here often, and bringing all of our friends.  If you are still reading this, I apologize for burying this last piece here at the bottom of this review, but I didn't want to lead with it and intimidate you from going (which you MUST!!): the place is rather expensive ($20 apps and pastas and ~$40 entrees) but TOTALLY worth it, flavor-wise.
