        "caption": "I've been here just once and had just one meal, so this is my first impression of the place. It was really cute inside and the staff was nice. I had the Asian rice bowl and it honestly was super disappointing. It was like 80% rice. I'm not even exaggerating. It was supposed to have nuts, tofu, fruity salsa, wonton and beans these ingredients were all sitting at the very top and not much of any at all. Then just below was literally a full bowl of rice. Now, this was one of the more affordable dishes on the menu, but still this place isn't exactly cheap. You'd expect that for the price point you'd get a bit more quality. The dish was vegetarian, so it's not even like they were losing profits through including meat in the dish. All the other ingredients are relatively affordable, so yeah, it could've definitely included more tofu. The dish felt lazy, disappointing and like they were cutting corners. I really wish I had pictures to show you. Premium priced dish for plain white rice. But I will say that everyone else's dish that I was there with looked really good, maybe small portions but good nonetheless.",

Again I get places have to raise the prices but with that being said I was never told at the time of ordering drink of the new prices.  I was going based on old menu given to me.  So I asked the girl to talk the extra money off, not because it was a 1.50 more, but because I know i shouldve been aware of prices regardless of using old menu.  Customers should always be told of changes on menus.  Thanks",

It was outdoor dining of course , because this establishment is right on point with the Coronavirus Protocols , it gives  the guests peace of mind and safety. The food was just as good as PreCovid19 span , I have experienced in other restaurants a limited menu due to the Pandemic , but Kuba is not limiting the food options on its menu. Drinks were NOT watered down with ice , so you are definitely getting your money's worth. The hosts were professional , friendly  , and very accommodating. There was live entertainment socially distant from the patrons of course,  and the Latin band was really good , the singer was exceptional. The last night at Kuba reminded me of a Block Party , that's what we New Yorkers called it when the everyone who lived close by forgot their life problems and enjoyed life just for a bit with people they and some they just met .",

It is akin to the days when you could go to Union City and enjoy yourself at one of old generation Cuban Restaurants.   Most of those are long gone but if you are looking for that culinary experience go to Kuba. The Cuban sandwiches will bring you home, the tostones rellenos de camarones are flawless and their tamal will truly make you think back to your Cuban mothers cooking. Excellent find and highly recommended.  Abbey Martinez, Fort Lee, NJ.",

Definitely will come back. The waiter was cool and we had an amazing time. The owner himself introduced himself and asked us if everything was great and to inform if anything is wrong. That makes a huge impact for the business because they want to grow and to continue to give an excellent service. Will definitely recommend my friends to come and I will come again to eat here.",

Unfortunately, this place was a huge disappointment. The service was very good. You can tell they really want to succeed. And I want them to succeed. But in my opinion, a lot has to change to make that happen. The menu is all over the place, Cuban sandwich, salmon wrap, pizza, Asian inspired dishes etc. This place doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. I say, stick to one thing and do it really well. We spoke to a couple of guys at a nearby table who had been before and said it was just ok but they wanted to try something else on the menu. They had the paella, which they said wasn\u2019t good. I did overhear the manager offer to serve them something else but they declined. We ate in the main dining room which lacked ambiance \u2014similar to what it looked like when GW Grill occupied the space.  I heard the bar area was nicer but after a less than satisfying experience we decided to exit. The area needs more diversity dining  options. I hope this place makes some changes and succeeds. I\u2019m rooting for you.",

It's rather fancy, which I really liked. Whoever design it has a great taste. Far away from the so clich\u00e9 pictures and paintings of mulatas/caf\u00e9/tabaco/ron/dirty Havana neighborhoods etc... One thing I particularly don't like about most of Cuban restaurants I've been before is that, in general, the servers try so hard to be friendly in the Cuban way, that they end by being really annoying and excessively over-familiar. This never happened in Kuba. They are all very professional. My mojito was the best I've tried since I left Cuba. It was just perfect. The right amount of each ingredient. The first sip took me back to the times when I was a kid and I went on vacation with my family to those hotels by the beach. The food was delicious. They have all the classics. Chef Jos\u00e9 knows how to honour his Cuban roots. I had the tropical paella... And I am glad I did. The Tres leches is to die for! The prices are fair. I have already recommended this place to everyone I know in Manhattan and NJ.",

The ceviche was a little skimpy on the fish, but with the avocado mash and plantain it was full of flavor.  My 7-year old had the children\u2019s menu organic chicken which was a huge portion and came with a mango salsa that was tasty.  I got a salad with salmon that was really green, fresh, and filling. My spouse got the oriental salmon with vegetables (we were trying to choose healthy and we\u2019re glad they had healthy options, although the more traditional Cuban things were probably amazing).  We both realized we should have asked for our salmon rare, since Latin restaurants tend to cook salmon fully. Overall we were very happy eating there..  The place had a great vibe and we liked their decoration and lighting.  There is a bar on the first level, and I understand they do a happy hour.  We skipped on the desserts but we were very tempted- the ones we saw pass to a table near us looked amazing!",
