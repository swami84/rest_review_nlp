Both of us enjoyed our sandwiches. These were definitely made properly and tasted great. There is something on the menu for everyone.  We will be stopping in to this caf\u00e9 again.

        "caption": "As the POC partner, who has worked in food service, of one of the previous reviewers who was there for the ordering experience, I would like to offer third-party insight\u2014 management, feel free to take it or leave it. Hopefully, this learning experience can be taken as information so if this same situation were to arise again, the outcomes would be improved.  THE STORY: It was most likely 15 minutes from ordering to pick up, but it took a good 10-15 minutes for us to get our order in from when we walked in the door. After ordering, we patiently waited until one of the gentlemen asked us \u201cwhat did you guys order?\u201d. We could clearly tell that they were slammed and we are not the type of people that walked up in 5 minutes to demand where are food was; we just stood and waited.  We said \u201cwe ordered 2 identical breakfast sandwiches and 2 iced lattes\u201d. They looked around for the physical tickets, couldn\u2019t find them, then tried to look on the POS system for our order, and once the employee checked under the credit card number, it was a completely different order\u2014 if I remember correctly it was a different breakfast sandwich and mocha. We said \u201cthat\u2019s not what we told you our order was, can you cancel our transaction\u201d. The employee agreed, then kindly showed us him actually cancelling it. We then walked out the door and ordered breakfast and coffee down the street.  THE OUTCOME: I would suggest, again, as someone who has been on both sides of this, to apologize immediately, and say \u201cwe are so sorry for that, that is not like us we are slammed today, please accept [a gift card for your troubles/your meals cooked ASAP with a cookie on the house/your meals cooked ASAP & a gift card, etc].\u201d I\u2019ve had a positive experience at Morgan St Cafe about a month ago and I hate that it got soiled with a poorly handled situation. It\u2019s not the fact that the food was late\u2014 that happens i get that. But it\u2019s the response. The fact that we spent 30 minutes out of our Sunday to basically just stand there and not get any food. Was I upset? Sure for about 30 seconds but I got over it. What I wished for afterwards is for management on google reviews to at least apologize. I can\u2019t think of a single person that would want a small business with BIPOC to fail, most negative reviews are just people speaking from emotion and that is feedback that can be taken in to better your business. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world out there and if one cafe produced less than satisfactory results (not just food, but hospitality) even in a day that they were slammed (it happens!), people will go to a different shop and get basically the same product. In order to survive and thrive during a global pandemic, please don\u2019t let the stress of it get to your responses as a business. I can only imagine the pressure you are under now, but at the end of the day, there are a dozen other shops also experiencing the detriments of this economic crisis that we can and will go to. Yes, we have had to wait 30 minutes at other places while they are busy too, but what made us come back was their response from it. It was apologetic, \u201cwe value you as a customer\u201d, it made you feel important, and then management did what they needed to do  to fix this problem and let us know. They made us feel like a part of a community. Whether it be retraining or setting a protocol for when this happens or even putting an additional crew member on these predicted busy hours\u2014 this is how you retain clients.  These are just my open thoughts and i hope you can take something from them. Until then, we will be picking up our breakfast & coffees down the street. Thank you for reading and have a great day.  EDIT: Please check the security tapes. Yelling is defined as \u201cto utter a loud cry, scream, or shout\u201d. The evidence will show that this did not occur. No grand hand gestures, no red faces from screaming. It will show us waiting for 15 minutes on our phones, then the barista asking us what our orders were, us trying to solve the issue at the counter, and then walking out.",

They do indeed celebrate birthdays, so we got a free red velvet-like cake thing that actually was a little stale. There was no singing by the staff, which is totally understandable because of COVID.  The food was really good. I had pancakes with a side of bacon and orange juice (that was a little on the warm side), my sister had French toast and her boyfriend had blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon and a strawberry banana smoothie.  The wait was long, about 30min because they were packed. We visited the restaurant on June 20th and guests were only allowed to eat outside on their patio at this point. I am completely fine with that because social distancing and everything. They have umbrellas for each table which is nice because it started to drizzle at one point while we were eating. The only downside is it was still very hot and humid which is uncomfortable when you're eating but the restaurant obviously can't control that.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking to safely eat out for breakfast or lunch.",

I ordered the bagel, a bag of chips, a Chobani yogurt( which was $2 ) and a turkey club sandwich that was already premade and wrapped up in plastic wrap. I paid $17 which I felt was a little high especially since the turkey club sucked,sorry it did. But I'll definitely return for the bagel!.

The bearded guy proceeded to call out a \u201cJune\u201d and I asked him if it was for Julie and of it was a Cubano sandwich, rolled his eyes and said, \u201cit\u2019s a Cubano, for June\u201d.

But this time I went to get lunch to go and was rudely \"greeted\" by the staff and rushed to make a choice from the employee who was complaining about taking his lunch break when we walked in. I got my sandwich to go, and opened it up to eat some on my walk back to the office. The bread was completely torn apart - it looked like someone had dropped it and tried to put it back together. I was only half a block away so I went back in to ask them to remake the sandwich - a reasonable request considering I paid $11 for it - he staff member looked at my and said \"yeah that bread is really squishy\" , didn't offer to fix it, and when I asked for a different bread he rolled his eyes at me. Not only was this service rude, it was unsanitary. I saw not one, but two staff members eating in the kitchen area, and one other staff member touched her mouth and braces repeatedly just in the short time we were there and then touch the sodas, kitchen equipment and POS station. Just...wow. i don't think I will forget this service.",
