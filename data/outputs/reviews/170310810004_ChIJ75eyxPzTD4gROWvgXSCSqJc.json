He was amazingly friendly and let me know That I had the option of grilled shrimp or lobster as well. He also told me that I should try the house-made Hennessey sauce. \u201cHennessey sauce?\u201d \u201cYes Hennessey sauce\u2026\u201d The owner is a uber-cute young lady (she bad) that looks like we could have went to high school together if I grew up in Chicago. She is amazingly congenial. I was fortunate enough to have her greet me as I walked in and give me a menu. Much success to her! Not much ambience in this place, although the outdoor seating is fabulous, and there is a section for a DJ and live music! Overall, the five stars that I gave this restaurant is for the sheer taste. I\u2019m sure that this restaurant will become a Chicago staple. It is \u201ca must visit\u201d and *must return* establishment. I\u2019ll put my 4,000,000+ views as a Google reviewer on it.",

For 4 Hennessy wings, and 5 fried biscuits was not worth it at all. (Prices too high for the quality & quantity ) My wings wasn't  dripping in the Hennessy sauce at all (pretty dry) fries were not hot and the biscuits were okay. Again the food is decent.

I was surprised to see the cashier without a mask on. My grilled catfish was mediocre at best. The presentation was not appealing and a little too salty. I did however enjoyed the chicken wings. I know they are working on all the kinks, so I will definitely give them another chance and order something different next time. I wish them the best.",
