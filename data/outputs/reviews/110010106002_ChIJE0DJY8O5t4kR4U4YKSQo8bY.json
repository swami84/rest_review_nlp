Good indoor space, nice arrangement of outside tables with heating elements. The beers are really good, I enjoyed the hefeweizen and hazy IPA. The food was really good as well - started with chicken strips, perfectly cooked with tasty dipping sauce. I had the beer burger which was cooked as I ordered it medium rare (pictured). It's a serious burger and delicious, as were the house made chips. Overall a wonderful experience. I rated it 4stars because it's a Seahawks bar, which on this occasion was not good for the local team. When Queen Bowser allows indoor dining again, we will return.

Started out with a flight of their beers, and some appetizers. Loved it! They have a new ordering system so you can put in what you want, add your table number, and your items will quickly come out, very efficient!!  We got the cheese curds (amazing), the compliance pizza bagels (those were promptly devoured), wings (special price on Wednesdays, so much flavor), and for our mains, a German sausage and burger with waffle fries.  It was an excellent experience! The staff was very friendly, accommodating, and professional. Went inside to use the restroom, and loved the decor! They've put a lot of thought into the small details and it shows!  I will definitely return next time I visit DC!",

We came there to play games and the staff member couldn\u2019t be bothered to let us know what games they had.

I\u2019m sorry, we respect support and love all people but it was clear that this establishment doesn\u2019t feel the same. Will never support this establishment again.  To their  response. 1) i recognize that they should have not done that 2) they were not going to give us our money back unless we ask 3) the individual acted by himself, so please do not take us and have audacity to categorize us as one person.  Your response is copy and paste reply that paints a narrative that works for their story. 4) maybe tour staff should have said that there was no games instead of rolling their eyes and saying ughh I\u2019ll go check. \u201cWe have nothing\u201d then abruptly walking away. Further, during a distressed economy you can\u2019t have staff that is as unpleasant, unprofessional and told us that \u201chaving separate tabs would be too hard\u201d for them.

This brewery boasts a spacious room, a menu full of craft beers, and a pristine collection of board games.  --I tried a few of their offerings including a Guava Gose, a Brut Kolsch, and a Witbier. All of which were pretty good, with the Gose being a particular standout. --As of July, the board games don't cost any money! They have a great selection that is well organized and well-maintained. Even though this brewery doesn't advertise itself as a board game bar, they are frankly doing a better job than nearly every other board game spot I've found in the city.  I've noticed other reviews citing acoustics in the space. During happy hour after work on a Wednesday, the space was only mildly crowded and volume levels were not an issue for me.  Cons: -limited kitchen options outside of featured menu days (though they are expanding this in the near future) -lighting levels were high (not an issue for me while playing board games, but may not create that intimate mood lighting if that's what you're looking for)  Please do yourself a favor - grab three or four of your coworkers and check this place out!",

It's in the same building as the REI (where the Beatles played their first U.S. concert). It's one large open room with a large wrap around bar in the center. There's bar seating and tables throughout the space. There are single uni-sex bathrooms in the back.  2) Beer: They sell their own craft beer on tap as well as local wine, mead, and cider (Farmhouse for $8). The prices aren't so bad either for an expensive city like D.C.  3) Food: For now, they have rotating food trucks come into their kitchen space and sell quality food. The day I went Roaming Rooster was selling fried chicken sandwiches for under $10.  4) Entertainment: They have over 100 games (Settlers, Secret Hitler, etc) and a stage for live mucis.  5) Kid friendly: They have high chairs and welcome little ones to enter.  If you want a great chill, fun brewery in NoMa, this is the best option!",
