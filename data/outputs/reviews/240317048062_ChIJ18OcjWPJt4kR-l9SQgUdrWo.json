They also gave us a free mango sticky rice since we ordered more than $30, even though we ordered through Uber and not their website. As a note, if you order on their website, they automatically add a 15% tip to your charge, even when choosing pick up.  The food was decent and some of them could have been better. The crispy pork wonton was basically just deep fried noodle, with barely any filling. The pad thai was too sweet and missing that signature sour flavor, not to mention too oily. The massaman curry was good with a lot of meat, though I wish they had given us more rice.  Overall, good but may not come again.",

Awesome! I never got the larb. The curry arrived and, for the first time in my dining out history,  it had Thai eggplant in it. The curry was nicely spicy, and prepared as I had requested. It was perfect,  until I tasted the first piece of duck. The duck was probably cooked last week, a bit too quickly in my opinion,  and kept in the cooler.  It was tough, dry, and the skin was inedible. I ate the vegetables and what I could of the meat. I always save my rice for last, to savor the curry. This was instant rice, not the jasmine rice I expected.  I didn't eat it. The bill was accurate. I left hungry,  and,  overall, disappointed.",

I have found authentic dishes served here. I like the catfish with all kinds of different peppers. It is very spicy and delicious. I have also enjoyed pork belly and green beans. It is very aromatic with great taste. Love the lychee and green tea ice cream. My second favorite sweet dish is the mango with sticky rice.",

My group of four split a few appetizers, including a grilled meat skewer dish that wasn't on the menu, but that one member of my party knew about. I wish I could remember the name...  We also had the drunken noodles: flavorful and spicy, the best kind of Thai comfort food. We also had a pork belly special that was outstanding, well seasoned, perfectly prepared, and huge. Finally, to even it all out, we went with spicy mixed veggies, which were impressive in their own right.  I'd recommend Bangkok Garden and will visit again when I'm in Bethesda.",

I wonder who and when placed all these pictures and wrote the reviews? We had their Kanom Jeeb dumplings, Green Curry and Drunken noodles and NONE of the dishes looked anywhere close to whats on the pictures and tasted even worth. Dumplings were store bought frozen Shaw Mai put for a few minutes in the microwave, Both noodle and curry had a very tough and chewy meat and curry was so watery you HAD to eat it with the spoon. We ordered medium spicy, they both didn't have spiciness at all. So the food was bad. The service was quick, rushed and unpleasant, kind of cafeteria type. And the value was poor considering the experience. Tip: if you don't what to loose even more money eating here do not order the tea (it will be tasteless and will cost you a fortune) No coming back and NO recommending to whose who know the REAL THAI taste.",

Which is why we were really happy to find our new local Thai favorite in Bethesda! The restaurant does seem to have some identity issue on if it is a restaurant or a pottery an antique store, but once you walk past the reception area, there is enough seating to be found. Service is good and to the point, if at times a tad bit sloppy. But the food makes up for it. Food was well cooked and flavorful. The spice level was to the liking of the wife and that is always good :) My rating of the dishes we ordered: Panang chicken - curry was yummy and chicken was tender and cooked well Pad Thai - decent portion size and well made Drunken Noodle with beef - the noodles and sauce were spot on but the beef was a tad bit chewy for my liking :( Shrimp Fried Rice - was very good too Chicken with Basil Leaves and Hot Chili Pepper - probably the weakest of the dishes that we ordered - the sauce had flavor but the chicken was dry and over cooked.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place when in the area.",
