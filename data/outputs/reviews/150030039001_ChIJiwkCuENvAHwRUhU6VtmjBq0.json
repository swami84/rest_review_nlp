Justin and the team will go out of their way to \"veganise\" most of their menu and you won't be disappointed.  Tortilla was ridiculously fresh and tasty, the vegetables seasonal and crisp, beans (not cooked in lard) and rice (not cooked in chicken stock) provided the traditional base upon which the homemade guacamole and salsa presided.  Do yourself a favour and save the fare to San Diego or Seattle. The best vegan burrito is right here in Honolulu.",

The wait time was 10 to 12 minutes.  The guy who took my order gave me a broken paper bag. Told me the taco is on top. I didn't think to check the order before I left. I got back to my office and opened the food up. After biting into the fish taco, I found it cold, hard and not too appetizing.  I opened the box with chips and what was suppose to be guacamole.  Instead, the order came with salsa that lacked taste! I will not be back.",
