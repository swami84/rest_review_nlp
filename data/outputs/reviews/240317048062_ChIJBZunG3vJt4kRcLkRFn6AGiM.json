My wife had the lasagne and it was luck warm and burnt around the top, obviously reheated while not quite defrosted and just for good measure the sauce was the tin tomatoes again. I would give this zero stars if I could. A complete waste of money as far as I was concerned. I would have complained but had two kids under 5 kicking off because they had left there food and was hungry. We have drawn a line under it and written off what we spent",

I ordered veal parmesan, it was covered with 2 slices cheese, maybe I am wrong, but I have never had sliced cheese in Italian food. My \"spaghetti sauce\" was canned stewed tomatoes.

This was my first visit to the new location, but it did not disappoint. Started with fried calamari, which had more crunch and less chew than most. I dumped parm and the entire bowl of sauce all over them. Perfect.  My main was the classic selection of Meatballs, mushrooms & peppers with spaghetti. Absolutely incredible taste and textures. So good in fact, I took the leftovers home and am enjoying a repeat meal while writing this. Yes, the portions can be generous.  I've been frequenting Pines and thier bottomless supply of Peroni for 20-something years. It's a Bethesda staple. When I feel like a genuine Italian meal for the food and not for the fancy, this is the first place I think of.",

Even the clientele is deceptive--it is the place where the very richest people in the Washington area come in the most informal clothes they own. The owner too is deceptive: seeing him popping  out of the kitchen now & then with his baseball hat none could possibly guess that he is a formidable romance-language scholar perfectly at home in  proto-Castilian poetry, the Cervantes canon beyond  Don Qixote & others such,.

When I reached the office, I realized that they had covered the eggplant parm in cheese and had not at all listened to what we had discussed. Upon this discovery, I called them and asked if they could right their wrongs by delivering the corrected item. They said that they couldn't; they \"didn't have drivers available\" (note that they do deliveries and have cars to do so). I told them then that I wanted a refund on my credit card then. They acted like they couldn't do it at first until I came all the way back. I said I didn't have time because I was at work. They finally took my card number and assured me that it would be done by EOB. But of course, it's the next day and it's still not there. Terrible customer service - and the food, from my friend who ordered as well, was 'decent at best.' Needless to say, we won't be going back.",

From the moment we walked into the door to now, sitting at the table finishing my wine, the service was horrendous.  This was my boyfriend and I's first restaurant as a couple; this was 6 years ago. I was so excited to return tonight because of this wonderful memory. However, the moment we sat down at our table, the waiter was pushy, urgent, and unpleasant. When I asked for the specials, he rapidly repeated them. I did not and could not hear him, so I politely asked him to repeat the last thing he said, which he became very annoyed. I ended up walking downstairs, to the specials board, to be informed of the specials.  It gets worse. He rushed our order, rushed our eating, and never came to our table once during the \"meal\". Thats okay, because I ended up getting everything I needed from the service station behind me.  When he dropped the check, there was no \"thank you have a nice day\", nothing. Not even eye contact. I said \"thank you, have a good night\" as he was walking away. Every single thing the waiter did, or lack there of, is an example of things not to do as a server at a restaurant. My boyfriend and I have 15 years of restaurant experience. If training new servers, I would use him as the example of the epitome of a terrible server. He was that bad. That bad for me to waste 10 minutes writing this review. This was such a disappointment because this restaurant was such a great memory to my boyfriend and I. We now are left with the memory of one of the worst waiters ever experienced.  Thanks for that Pines of Rome.",

This is a relatively quirky old restaurant with weird charm to it especially since it is now in the old building of a sushi restaurant. Also, its pretty cheap for a quick good meal.",

The meal was in fact reasonably priced but the God was amazing - we shared the white pizza and I had chicken cacciatore which I promptly spilled on my white blouse. We came back to Pines many times over the years and the food was always delicious.  My husband passed away a year and a half ago and I went back last November to celebrate his birthday - this time I had the eggplant Parmesan and a cannoli.

Food- I had veal veal parmigiana that the meat was dry, flavorless, and overcooked. The spaghetti was undercooked and was chewy and the sauce was bland/flavorless and tasted like poor quality canned sauce. My friends dishes were the same quality.  Service- TERRIBLE. Never checked on us after we ordered until to give us our check. Stood around in sight and gave us eye contact and never came over.  Decor- Poor. Old, dingy, dirty, outdated.",

Salads are definitely weak, although the \"family size\" salad isn't bad if you have sharers. Wine comes in large portions, if you like that.
