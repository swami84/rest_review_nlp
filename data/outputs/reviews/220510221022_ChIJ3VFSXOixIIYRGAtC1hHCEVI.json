        "caption": "Finally, an authentic Indian restaurant in the New Orleans area. Mantra opened last month and I stopped by over the weekend for lunch. Location was right off I-10 so couldn\u2019t be more convenient. Seating for 50 people but due to COVID-19 restrictions, only 20 odd people were allowed at one time so almost an hour wait. Decor was ok but the great service almost made us feel like fine dining. We ordered samosa chat (6.95) and chili chicken (11.95) for appetizers. Samosa chat was good but chili chicken was mediocre. We also ordered mango lassi (3.95) and it was good. We ordered chicken tikka masala (13.95) from chicken entrees and paneer masala (12.95) from vegetarian entrees and they were both equally good. The food came with white rice. We also ordered the bread sampler basket (6.95) which came with a mix of 3 Naans, highly recommended. I requested some raw onions but for some strange reason, it took forever to arrive so that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll take against their service. We also ordered gulab jamun (2.95) and Ras malai (3.95) for desserts and they were good. Overall, 4 out of 5 and next time, I\u2019ll do takeout and try their other dishes. Btw, the most authentic Indian restaurant in Louisiana before \u2018Mantra\u2019 was in Hammond, Punjabi Dhaba so I was pleasantly surprised to see the same chef and another employee on the front desk from there. The food tasted exactly like \u2018Punjabi Dhaba\u2019 so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of the chefs from there has opened this establishment. I would advice Indian food lovers to avoid the worse Indian restaurant on Magazine street, Saffron Nola, supposedly a fusion restaurant. These people know nothing about Indian food or local Louisiana food for that matter. Anyone who dines here knows nothing about Indian food. Anyway, after living in New York all my life and eating authentic/ good Indian food, it was nice to eat it again in New Orleans at Mantra or if you\u2019re in Hammond, at Punjabi Dhaba but pls do avoid, the fake wannabe high priced dump like \u2018Saffron Nola\u2019 at all cost.  December 31, 2020 It was my 3rd trip to Mantra and let\u2019s just say that I\u2019ve found the most authentic Indian restaurant in Louisiana period. Everything from chole bature to chicken tikka masala to paneer masala to lamb vindaloo to shrimp curry to chicken mantra was good. Dessert does need some work as kheer and ras malai was pretty mediocre. Service was excellent as always. Ignorance is bless if you\u2019re still eating at the dump \u2018saffron nola\u2019 on magazine street!",

I've been to several other Indian restaurants in the New Orleans area, this one is the new runaway favorite.  The staff was polite and friendly, order was ready faster than originally stated, and they even call you back when your food is ready for pickup.  My go-to entree for Indian is Karahi chicken, and Mantra's is the best I've ever had.  Medium spicy is just enough heat to make your mouth tingle, chicken is tender, bell peppers are cooked perfectly (still a little bite, not soft and soggy).  Garlic naan was perfectly charred, veggie pakora was crispy and delicious.  Keep it up!",

So far, I've tried the aloo paratha, keema naan, garlic naan, and chili naan and all of them were flavorful, light, and fluffy. The tandoori paneer was like nothing I've had before, roasted with bell peppers, charred, hearty and delicious. We also had the chole with fry bread, which was a delightful surprise, cooked perfectly and so savory. The kofta korma was fresh, firm, and delectable, topped with cheese. Creamy, fragrant, I could dive into that sauce! For spice lovers, the vindaloo and Goran curry were smoky and complex. Mantra is fantastic. I'll be visiting again and again. You should, too!",

Arrived then that hostess told us they were booked for the night & not accepting anymore customers due to other reservations. Ok, so we asked if we can order to go. She told us no.. (what?). So thinking of a solution, I said ok guess I need to call ahead of time and make a reservation. She said no we don't over the phone anymore due to people not showing up and that we have to come in person to know with a \"sorry\" (Really?Reservation notepad had names and callback #s.. I was not coming in 10 min before close). So you're expecting your customers to guess on a Saturday night, in person, whether y'all are available or not? She just looked at me & said some things with some attitude with another \"I'm sorry.\"  I worked in the restaurant business for years so I have some degree of sympathy for people in that realm, but that was some garbage service by that hostess-unless everything she said was actually true, then absolutely never going back nor should any other bz man or woman (why I'm writing this to save others time & the headache). Food looks great but that was very annoying & disrespectful. Not going back until the owners fix that.",

We ordered the onion bhaji as an appetizer. After an exceptionally long wait, whereas I had time to down 2 goblets of water, the onions came out (think fried onion petals, indian style). I got about two bites into one piece, when the chicken biryani and the chicken tikka masala arrived. Hmmmm.  The onion bhaji itself was really good, but the chutneys were sort of non descript and served in disposable plastic cups. I ate more onions while my lunch date started in on the biryani, which I had a bite of it, and it was DELICIOUS. The dish it came on was absolutely beautiful, as well. I mentioned that I was surprised the chicken tikka masala didn't come with rice, as it was a lot of tomato gravy in the very intricate bowl. A few bites later, a gorgeous bowl of rice was delivered, and we also let the person know we had ordered naan. He said he was aware. It was strange that the rice was not delivered with the tikka masala and then stranger still that the naan showed up significantly later. The tikka masala, while flavorful, was very sweet and had no heat to it, which was disappointing. (When we were handed the receipt, I noticed it had been put in as \"mild\", but I was not asked about spice level preference.) The cheese stuffed naan was REALLY, REALLY good. Really good. We finished our meal, and waited for boxes. And waited. And waited. And waited. And then waited for our check. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.  I would be hesitant to eat here again, just because the service was....so so so slow. I would love to try a few more dishes, and I'd definitely like to try the chicken tikka masala with some heat to it. Hopefully, they can work these issues out and someone will convince me to try again. (It was quite obvious that other diners were agitated at the level of service, as well.)",

Very good naan, certainly didn't come out of a food service box from Deep. The mint chutney on the side was fresh and full of flavor. Parathas were great. Shrimp vindaloo was excellent and the chicken tikka masala was ridiculously good. We accidentally also ordered an aloo gobi entr\u00e9e but that was a great mistake to enjoy for lunch the next day. Yummy samosas!  Will definitely be back. Congratulations on your new restaurant and I hope it brings you both lots of success in the future!",

Even on a very busy night like tonight where they had a almost to covid capacity house and lots of to-go orders! All covid protocols were followed by staff and customers! We ordered the tomato soup, lamb vindaloo (spicy), mantra chicken (spicy), and Naan sampler basket! The entrees also came with rice! Seriously, the food was SO delicious and authentic and we haven\u2019t had Indian food like this in New Orleans for at least 10 years!! Cannot wait to go back there more often or to order via Waitr or Grubhub!!",
