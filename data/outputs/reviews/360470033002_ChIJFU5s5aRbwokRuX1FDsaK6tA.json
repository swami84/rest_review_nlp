When I had first heard about it I thought you know it's a little gimmicky (if you watch Top Chef, it seems the whole deconstruction thing was a phase that passed). And yet, deep in my sole I wanted it so badly. And when I finally, FINALLY had...I realized how well it works.  You got to taste and appreciate the espresso, which was beautiful, that I had to drink a little with the milk, but the separation of it made me appreciate the creaminess and sweetness of the milk so that when I finished the deconstructed aspects and moved on to the latte, I could drink it without sugar, and I have never been one to be able to take my latte without sugar. It was lovely!  The decor and atmosphere in the space is beautiful. It shows meticulous concern, love of coffee, and good use of space/tables for people who are there to work/catch up. It's very warm and makes me happy!  I've since met the owner who is all-around goodness - sweet, humble, and clearly cares about coffee. Everyone else who I've come across who works there have also exuded similar vibes which is so rare and so great.  I have also tried the nitro with milk - only my second time having nitro, and it was lovely as well. I have bought bags of the drip coffee beans because it is perfect for the picky eater/coffee drinker.  Definitely my favorite place to have coffee across the US (I have tried a lot of coffee places...).",

        "caption": "Coffee Project NY was one of my last destinations this past weekend, for my weekender trip or D3. I did not exactly know about them before this visit, as I searched for a coffee shop in Brooklyn on a whim, having been staying and exploring Brooklyn for the weekend. Nevertheless, I'm glad that I got to try this coffee shop than others. If anything, I'm a fellow coffee person with my own brewers (hario V60 and chemex), gooseneck kettle, and electric conical burr grinder at home. There are a good portion of coffee shops that do have the pour-over available, but some still have this automated to save their baristas time for other orders. This is understandable, but there's that factor that's lost when you start to automate these. This brings me to the point of their emphasis on coffee, and that I was happy to see them focusing on the pour-over. It might look really simple but there's more fine-print to it, especially that with the temperature, grinds, and the pour technique during the brewing process. In addition to these, the space is rather spacious and very conducive to either doing work or socializing with friends/family. I'm also glad that they mention having this location as a \"playground\" for baristas, as this empowers them to perfect their craft of coffee. Will definitely be coming back here, and may even take one of their classes to supplement my own craft of coffee at home!",

Space has a decent sitting area.  They have restrooms.  Staff is really friendly and engaging.   It's a block from BAM and Fulton Mall.   Try this spot over Hungry Ghost around the corner.  Like Hungry Ghost but better coffee and cooler atmosphere. Coffee is good.   And they offer a decent amount of snack/lunch options.   Prices are average for coffee shops in area.    Great spot to have in neighborhood.    Looking forward to Future visits.",
