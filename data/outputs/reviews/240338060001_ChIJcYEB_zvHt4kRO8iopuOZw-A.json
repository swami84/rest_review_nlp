The server spent several minutes searching and trying to find the order. This should have simple and fast: NOT! - a Disaster! After several tries and spelling out my name for her, she told me the only way she could fill the order was to see proof of it on my phone which I did not have. I left and as I was about to leave the parking lot she appeared with the order. I was angry and told her that it was extremely poor service and I would complain to the corporate headquarters. She tried to shift the blame to me by lying and saying I didn't provide my name- which I obviously did- spelling it out for her several times. Very disappointing, RUDE and incompetent basic service!! NOT ACCEPTABLE! Will not ever return- beware of this kind of service at this location!",

I must say, the employees that work there are even better; in particular Louis, the manager,.Carlos and Elena. Today is my second day in a row hahha, mm mm good! Let me tell you why I love these guys much. I went in yesterday to pickup my pre-order but when I got there I noticed the sign on the window that says buy a bowl n drink and get 2nd bowl free. So I was like cool but Louis said,\"No, I'm sorry I needed to come in to order both to get the deal. So I was like, well let me cancel the order and do it that way. He said I could but the credit will take 7-10 days and I was like, no it's not worth it. But he could really see in my eyes \ud83d\udc40  I really wanted it. Then says, no problem I'm going to give you the bowl don't worry about it. I was so pleasantly surprised and happy. I mean who does this? This is just one example of their kindness and great service they provide. This kind gesture from not only Louis but the others especially Elena , who is so very kind  as well, will definitely keep me coming back.",

A colleague of mine ordered the steak salad. We both put our own veggie variations on top. Fast forward a few hours and my co worker had intense cramps and had diarrhea as well as vomiting. I also ended up with extremely intense cramps and diarrhea. I think it\u2019s obvious where made us both sick. Now I don\u2019t know if because they are under staffed that they aren\u2019t checking the food properly for expiration, or what! We both have been turned off of Mezeh for now.  I suggest the district manager go and check on them at PG Plaza. They need some help! Nothing worse than food poisoning on your lunch break.",

Unpacking our food, he first thing we noticed was that the bowls were not full and I am comparing them to what we received last month, which was the exact same order.  We were supposed to have 2 8 oz. basmati rice, they clearly  put the rice in 2 oz container, shorting us on a main ingredient. Sauce was missing, and the 2 that we did get, were half full containers.  We attempted to call Mezeh, but when you hit #5 to get a person, you get sent back to the beginning of the call menu.  There is no customer service number.  We want to support keeping businesses open and those working. We could have picked up our order but wanted to support those who make income delivering.  With that being said, I very much doubt I will be ordering again.  I would hope for some consistency, but there were too many mistakes.  There has always been some hesitation ordering online and having it delivered for this very reason.  We'll be waiting until we can go in person.",
