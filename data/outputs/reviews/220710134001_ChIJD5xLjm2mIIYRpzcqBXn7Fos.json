As we entered there we all kind of signs about covid 19 and everything else. So we sit down, the service was ok nothing to brag about. So I ordered the drum with crawfish topping, which was good. My wife got the gulf shrimp boil which was excellent. Everything was good until we get the check.  We discover a 20% gratuity already add to our check. I'm sorry, but I think i should decide if the service is worth a 20% tip or not,  Not the owner who is trying to get me to pay his employees, while he pays them whatever.",

The shrimp caminada Po boy was fabulous, the bread was perfect and it was unfried shrimp and not covered in mayonnaise, so very good. I cannot stress this enough, even if you split the sandwich like we did, you need to try this sandwich. We happened to be there during a huge thunderstorm so we grabbed another drink and Kyle recommended the White Chocolate Breading Pudding \u00e0 la mode, it was the perfect ending to an amazing meal made better by the fact that it was shared and each of us left satiated but not \u201cstuffed\u201d.",

Since we were not sure what to have, she gave us wonderful suggestions as we were not to hungry.  My husband had the JuJu shrimp and it was a very large portion. I had the grilled Caesar Salad, so flavorful.  Her suggestions of wine and specialty drinks were also great.  The way she went to each table and made each one feel special was a delight to see.   We chatted a great deal, but not sure if I got her name correct (sorry) Carrie/Callie.  Thank you for being so attentive.",

Update: I returned and again I was pleased with the food! The service at the bar is well and its location is close to the hotel. It's a more laid back place compared to Bourbon Street (Not Complaining at all). I'll be returning here next time I come back in town!",

As we can upon the restaurant we where please with the menu selection. I personally wanted the dish displayed on the bored outside.  We walk in and are seated at a very small table for 4 people. We are then handed out menus. As I order a sweet tea the waitress tells me they do not have sweet tea. That\u2019s very upsetting for a southern restaurant. Three people at the table ordered a dr.pepper. The dr.pepper was absolutely horrible. We made her take it back. We then ask for a root beer. The waitress was not sure if she can get us a that drink. She did bring us back glass bottle root beers from the bar. We go to order our food the advertised item I wanted the waitress said they did not have it. The waitress was very in unknowledgeable about the menu.  We waited a very long time for our food to arrive. Two of the our plates where cold. Also everyone received their food but me and I had to wait even longer. As we got the bill and finished our food we realized we where charged an extra 10 just for the root beer. The waitress did not tell us about this charge. A little while later a man came up to us asking if everything was okay. We explained all of our problems he told us there was nothing he could do we should have told him sooner. We where not able to tell him sooner he didn\u2019t approach us until after we where done.",

Our waiter,Alex was very Good,attentive and conscientious. We were dining outside and had more than 3 rats running around our table. We had to leave and Alex our waiter saw what happened and called out the manager who explained that this is New Orleans and after dark the rats come out and there is nothing they could do. We didn't finish our meal,we paid and left and of course never to return again. Management could have rectified this situation however the only thing that was said was \"we are sorry\".",

We would eventually get a booth as a result of the table size. We ordered two crab dips for our table. Both of them arrived hot, looked nice, and tasted pretty good too. This was a hit with the group. We ordered bowls of seafood gumbo with rice. The bowls were served with a half crab on top of the meal. The ladies didn't eat or like crab served this way. Two in our group did not eat oysters contained in the gumbo and thought it was just okay. Two ordered fish and fries which was a direct hit with the group and popular.  I ordered the fish sandwich and fries, which was a bit disappointing as the fish was VERY thin. I tasted more ingredients than I did fish. The service was pretty good and the server was knowledgeable which was a great help to our group. We did have to ask for a refill on our drinks. This whole restaurant food experience was pretty good, but not great.",

The drinks are excellent.For mains i highly recommend the sticky ribs and the mac and cheese is another winner, plus some old bayou favorites like shrimp and grits. For Dessert hit the lemon icebox cake or the red velvet cheesecake.  Coupled with fast friendly service this place is an absolute Gem. As an added bonus they fit us in when no other restaurant would! Their staff definitely got this place the 5th star.",

When I got there it was the opposite but the same price ( which was high for a low level essential oil ) and it said pure on it like mimicking the pure stuff. I was being very specific.  On the flip side they had an amazing selection of minerals and jewelery with a fair price and we're helpful to me in finding a low cost assortment of specific mineral stones. This I did like. Their prices were more than fair in comparison to other places, Cheers. I",

You must try these if you stop in. We were looking for a little New Orleans flare and were not disappointed. The seafood was perfectly grilled and served on fresh flavorful side dishes. The bourbon pecan pie topped it off. It was the very best pie I have tasted. Service was top notch as well.",
