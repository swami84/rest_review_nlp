I tell him my name and he replies \"Oh I refunded your order. We didn't have this gf dough or ice cream.\"  He could've called or something. Seemed to me he just didn't feel like making it.

It was supposed to come with basil but I guess they forgot it on mine because I was expecting it to be green. If you like thin crust pizza you\u2019ll really enjoy. The caesar salad that came with the combo was on the small side so if I came back, I\u2019d just get the whole pizza. The staff was kind. This location didn\u2019t have the lemon a\u00e7a\u00ed soda even though it was on the menu online so I ended up just getting water. On a 10 point scale, I\u2019d give the pizza an 8.5 & the salad a 2 lol",

Fast, hospitable service that goes above and beyond. Quality ingredients, careful preparation, and unbeatable crust. Satisfying portions at a fair price and you can't go wrong with any of the Stubborn Sodas on tap. If nothing else, I urge you to give Oath a try, I'm confident your experience will speak for itself.",

Before you go definitely sign up for their loyalty program. You get 50% off your first pizza and then you can cancel right away. Totally worth it.  Oath is a fast fire pizza place that's a bit fancier than most of the other ones I've run stopped in. They have a couple of gourmet pizzas pre-designed or you can build your own. We tried The David and the Muffled Trushroom. Ordering was quick and painless and we only waited about five minutes for our pizzas to be done. The half pizzas were cut into 3 slices each and honestly felt a little small compared to other places like this. However both of them tasted delicious. The flavors were wonderful and all complimented each other nicely. It felt pretty fancy for a \"fast food\" place.  I wish there were a few more options on their menu like sides or desserts, but if they want to focus on pizza and do it well that's fine too. If we're every back in the area we'd stop in again, but this time we'd order full pizzas so we wouldn't leave hungry!",

I typically order my pizzas with all meat (think Meat-lovers or Carnivores) but since it was something new, I decided to live outside of my comfort zone and ordered the Dougie. I was shocked with how good it was and it may lead me to rethink my future pizza decisions.  I removed 1 star for two minor reasons. 1) The lack of familiar soda options available.  The temperatures that day we're exceeding 90\u00b0 and I was definitely looking forward to having an ice cold Coke. I had the \"draft cola\" (I think that's what it was called) and it was decent but definitely wasn't what I was craving. 2) The staff wasn't very friendly. I'm not asking for a Chick-fil-a (\"my pleasure\") level interaction but none of the people working seemed to understand or care about how their apathetic \"just a job\" demeanor can impact the overall experience.  Ultimately, we were all pleasantly surprised and would definitely visit this or any other Oath Pizza location in the future!",

We were one of four people there making us think they are banking on the Nationals crowd supporting their business. If you don't care about eating the best pizza in DC, you're in luck.  Oath Pizza serves custom and suggested for you personal pizzas. An eleven inch pizza cost just under $12. I made my own pizza with tomato sauce, cheese, sausage, garlic, and spice aioli. It came out within 6 minutes and it was meh. The crust was super thin, which makes it easier to burn and they did. It was slightly burned and too crunchy. It also lacked flavor.  On the plus side, the space is beautiful with interesting wall art, posters, and plenty of seating. The staff is friendly and they have good soda (and chocolate chip cookies for dessert). If you want to eat healthier, they create seasonal salads.  If you care about getting the best pizza in town, walk to nearby All Purpose or venture to Eastern Market for Seventh Hill. Even &pizza on Barracks Row is a better option.",
