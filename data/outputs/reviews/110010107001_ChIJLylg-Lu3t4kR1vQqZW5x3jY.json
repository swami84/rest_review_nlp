We stopped there without prior planning and as we were taking a look at what the outdoor posted menu offered, two extremely satisfied tourists went out and randomly strongly encouraged us to try it as they were very happy with their own experience. They talked non stop about how good the food was and how it should be an absolute loss if we dont give it a try. This is when another tourist got out of the restaurant and acertained what was previously advised. We did not regret it at all. The menu is rich and limited at the same time which is something I appreciate especially when I am new to the experience as I get easily lost when it comes to choosing from a big unfamiliar list. Each one of us had a preference and we all shared to taste. Everything was delicious ( crab cake, crab and avocado stack, soup of the day, filet mignon, LAMB BURGER, lobster raviolli). Also the music was perfect. Calm french ambiance. They also serve bread and unsalted butter while the order is being processed. The service is a little bit slow though but the waiters are helpful.",

Still we were the only ones in the restaurant. It was like a very strange dream. Then they added 20 percent gratuity on top of the tax, which is normally what I would tip, but not after an experience like this??!! I said something but left it as is, but the experience was so bad that I felt like I had to leave a review. Never again would I even humor coming back. I'd rather go hungry.",

The manager looked into the issue, and he called my husband back with his sincere apologies and refunded not only the tip amount, but the amount for our entire check.  I am pleasantly surprised at the outcome; I feel that the manager did everything in his power to completely rectify the experience we had, and I appreciate that.  Honestly, too, I think the food would have been delicious, had it been served immediately, so it may be worth a try if you are in the area. My original review is still below, because, while the manager rectified the situation, it still important for other's to know things like this, especially when spending the kind of money this place calls for, and to know if you get service like this, get a manager involved before you leave. ______________________________________________________________________  This place was awful.  After we placed our order, we never saw the server.  Our food was served to us cold, after sitting in the window for who knows how long, and it took me another ten minutes to flag a server down to address the issue, and instead of fixing the issue, they put my medium rare steak in the microwave and brought it back out to me.  Again, after this, I never saw a server again.  It took us twenty minutes of servers walking by us and our plates sitting on the edge of the table, doing their side work, to get them to take our plates and bring the check.  My husband and I left no tip, after spending $80 on an awful, re-heated meal.  However, when I looked at my bank account this morning, the server took it upon himself to charge a $14 un-authorized tip to my card.  So if you do go here, make sure you keep your receipt, and check the charge a few days later.  This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.",
