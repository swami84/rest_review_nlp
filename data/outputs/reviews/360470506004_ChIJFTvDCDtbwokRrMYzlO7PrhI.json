The first time I came there I was told that this coupon is not valid for take away (wtf!?, but ok), though at that time there was no customer because of the late hour, the guy said that we can sit and eat in there.  So I decided to give them a second try and actually dine in there with my family. But when we arrived there for the second time we were informed that it's unexpectedly closed and no explanation why. On top of that when asked they couldn't tell what their actual working hours are, either because of utter ignorance and incompetence or simply lack of English \ud83d\ude05  So, future customer, beware of this restaurant. As it has no fixed working hours and no competent workers which can give you meaningful answers and arguments!",

After having to chew the meat way too many times, I realized once I cut into another cube of meat that was undercooked. Things happen right? I gave the restaurant a call where the man I spoke with informed me that is the way the dish is served. I stressed the meat was undercooked and he was welcome to come and get it for inspection. He once again stated that's the way it is served. Okay, so this restaurant serves undercooked meat by its own admission. What's worst? He at no point offered to make it right at all. Informing the general public so we can protect ourselves from food poisoning or worst. Makes me wonder what else could be going on in there. I will reach out to the health department. For now, order somewhere safe.",

On top of this there were multiple thick black hairs strewn about the food. They also added food that I didnt order and I was forced to pay for it. When I called them to let them know, the person on the phone yelled at me and called me a liar and accused me of \u201cplacing the hairs there myself\u201d and tried telling me that I DID order the extra food. I asked for different food or a refund and the guy hung up on me. I\u2019m still in shock and cannot believe the way he spoke to me.

The  much awaited food arrived finally.  I took my first bite and was like ewwwww, the food tasted so bad.  I ordered spinach and cauliflower/potato (i am a vegetarian) spinach tasted like it was boiled and then they sauteed some onions and just threw boiled spinach in it...tasted awful, same thing for cauliflower/potatoes, tasted boiled and sauteed in heavily loaded curry powder and onions, ewwwww... unbelievable, horrible tasting food.  What a waste of money.  I will never order from this place again...I wish I could give ZERO stars but didn't have a choice. I guess people who gave anything above 1 star don't know what Indian food is supposed to taste like that's why they did that.",
