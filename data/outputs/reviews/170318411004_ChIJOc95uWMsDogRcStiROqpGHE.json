They charge by the pound, but they actually serve much less poundage of fish than u pay for.  We ordered 2.5 lbs of tialipa, but when it came out, instead of 1 big 2.5 lb fish, they served 3 small fishes, with each fish only being a head plus ONE side of the fish body, with the other side of the fish body missing.

Service:  Its quick, but during busy hours, it can be a bit lacking since the servers get a bit overwhelmed.  Ambience: The casual restaurant isn't too large and is a typical Chinatown restaurant with TV screens playing Chinese TV.  It's mostly filled with Chinese customers (shows its authenticity), but the servers really like it when Americans join in on the yummy cuisine.  Food: The one item that everyone gets is the fried, boiled fish.  It's a large carp that had been fried and then placed in a hot pot with a ton of Szechuan spices.  You are welcome to order other items to cook in the hot pot, too!  Also, they have $1 cumin lamb sticks!!!",
