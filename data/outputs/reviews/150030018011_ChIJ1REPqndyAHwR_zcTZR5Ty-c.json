However, the seafood has a strong fishy taste (especially shrimp). Okonomiyaki has a teriyaki sauce that is too strong with strong teriyaki sauce, and pickled ginger is breaking the balance. Please refer to the Hobulho. Scoring is the service and table status. I don't bring my tips at 20%, but the chair bursts and the cotton is flying. But one black waiter was very friendly. In summary, food is okay, but it is easy to get hurt by service. This is it.

So we ordered what he suggested: the seafood and steak combo. Which is 70 dollars. He promised us the portion is big enough we only need to order a side dish to make ourselves full. When he brought out the combo dish, I was even happy for a second because I thought they were so nice to separate combo into different plates for us to share, and it turned out that plate was it for all of us to share! Over 70 dollars for some choppy octopus, shrimps and some mediocre steak? The portion was so small that we barely fed ourselves. Most ridiculous things is that the waiter added a 15 percent tips to our bill without letting us know. We found out that and asked him to take it out from the bill because I can\u2019t see any reason that we would tip them! Anyway, after spent 60 dollars per person, we left the restaurant with a empty stomach.",

We waited an awkwardly long time until a server came over and told us they had space in the bar. We sat down, looked at the menu and a few minutes later, the same waiter told us they made a mistake and they had a reservation for the bar in ~40 minutes and if we stayed that we had to be done by then. I looked around the place...because it was laughably empty. Since we hadn't ordered yet, I wasn't even sure we could be done in time and it pretty much seemed like he was kicking us out. I told him we would leave and he apologized for his staffing issue (???). I was unclear why he said that since he just said they had a reservation coming in... It as such a rude experience....I cannot express how empty this place was when he was kicking us out. Needless to say, this place has horrible customer service and would not recommend it.",

To start, the food was mediocre at best,  and service was extremely slow. My girlfriend and I waited for at least 10 minutes before we could place our order, and the restaurant was not even half full at the time. When our orders came (the waitress at least reminded us that it would take more than 20 minutes) much later, they were in tiny portions.  What further infuriates me is the fact when the check came, a 15% tip was already included (which is reasonable), but it was calculated on the post-tax subtotal. If this is done systematically, then it constitutes a blatant cheat on the customers, albeit in small proportions one at a time. And this really shows their true attitude towards us customers - one that is exploitative and condescending.  All in all, I would never recommend this place to anyone. Even if you live in a hotel right next to it, go somewhere else, as there are many more excellent restaurants close by that will also treat you right.",

My wife was not hungry so we just decided to have one entree, one appetizer and water for drinks. This obviously didn't go well with our waiter since that means his tips can't be big enough. It was just very uncomfortable from the beginning, I was initially super excited to learn about various types of okonomiyaki, but our waiter just wanted to wrap our orders asap and move on to the \"richer\" clients. Also point to note was the restaurant was not super crowded. After taking the initial order our waiter didn't show up till the end, luckily the other lady waitress was sweet and she refilled our water once after noticing that we were being completely ignored. Overall I would stay away from this place if you are not white or if you don't plan to order a lot of food. The food in itself was alright, nothing to rave about.",

Clutter everywhere. Soon found out why as I watched the Manager on duty have a meltdown for everyone to see and hear in the middle of dinner. Very unprofessional and immature and kinda ruined the dinner experience for me as I watched this young man fail in handling a situation with his staff and large group at a nearby table. It was like a TV drama series. Instead of the drama, he'd be better off apologizing for their table screw up, comping something for them and inviting them back, then moving on to perhaps....CLEANING! The bathroom also was a disaster area. I come here annually and always like to come here, the food is great and still very good despite their management challenge.

TL;DR version: if you like savory seafood and meat, Japanese teppan-style cuisine, and a comfortable-yet-chic atmosphere, you will definitely not be disappointed.  We'd been to Jinroku on somewhat of a whim last year - basically, we wanted Teppan-style dining but didn't want to go somewhere like Benihana, so I looked around and found Jinroku. I was a bit skeptical as it's somewhat nondescript and not on the main drag (spoken like a true tourist), but man am I happy we went.  Both times we've gone, we sat at the grill and watched the expert chefs at work. For starters, our server was incredibly helpful and was very knowledgeable on all the menu items. I told him that I wanted sake but wasn't really experienced on the subject, and he went over, in detail, each of their offerings and helped me pick one that fit my tastes. He also was very patient with us and helped explain the admittedly large number of questions my girlfriend and I had regarding certain menu items.  I ordered the Steak and Lobster from the Teppan menu, my girlfriend I believe had a mixture of seafood, also from said menu. Both were incredibly delicious - the best lobster I have ever, ever tasted in my life (the steak and even the veggies were also to die for...umami is something that these guys put in everything they do, from beginning to end). We also had bacon-wrapped asparagus for an appetizer, which was the perfect prelude to our meal as it wasn't incredibly filling, perfect for two to split, and incredibly savory.  To make a potentially long story short, we sat for nearly 2 hours, had a few beers/martinis, and conversed with the chefs, who are still some of the nicest people we've come across in our two vacations to Honolulu. When they learned that we were returning customers from the year before, they brought us out a dessert on the house, which again, was delicious and a very kind gesture.  I'm already looking forward to next year. We made reservations this year, but there were open tables even during peak dinner hours both times we went, when dinner basically anywhere else in Waikiki would involve at least a 30-minute wait. Also, I definitely recommend sitting at the grill for a more involved dining experience, but be aware that it does get rather warm there - not uncomfortably so, but something to keep in mind.",

The food is excellent.  The takoyaki and okonomiyaki are very well prepared, but the gyoza yaki is the best.  The quality of food is comparable to a quality okonomiyaki restaurant in Japan.  The portions are a bit small, so you'll probably have to order several items to satiate your appetite.  The prices are a bit expensive per dish, so be careful.  The food is good, so it's very easy to order 3 or 4 dishes and blow your dinner budget.  On the flip side, they have a bar with cheap drinks, so if that's your thing, and you like takoyaki, this is your place.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the price.  I know the Japanese yen is strong right now, and there's probably a Waikiki mark up included in the price as well, but takoyaki and okonomiyaki is supposed to be cheap, casual eats.  This place has a fancy ambiance and the comparable price to go with it.  I guess there's nothing wrong with that, but that kind of goes against the image I have of okonomiyaki joints.  In any case, it's much cheaper than going to a bad hotel restaurant in the area, so this place is highly recommended.  The service was great, and the people there were very friendly.  I would have eaten here every day if every single menu item was a couple of bucks cheaper.",

We did not have a great time service-wise: the place was packed and we had to wait a long time for our food. Given we had to seen dishes being prepared for all the rest of the restaurant, this was a bit annoying. The quality of the food was worth the wait: in a place where we had mostly less than average food, these well cooked servings did not have the annoying american touch of unlikely sauces. Prices were extremely reasonable for the place, and we would have spent every evening in this restaurant if it wasn't for the little mishap with the service.",

I recommend sitting at the bar and interacting with the chefs while they cook up delicious masterpieces. this is no sushi place so explore the appetizers (try pork belly omelet appetizer). Appetizers are $7, entrees are like $14, and gourmet entrees (beef, lobster) is north of $25... very fair prices for such outstanding service and tasty food. Highly recommended.",

We had good service and the kitchen was did everything we asked for even if we arrived 2 min before they closed.  We had a table just by the open doors which gave a nice evening atmosphere.",
