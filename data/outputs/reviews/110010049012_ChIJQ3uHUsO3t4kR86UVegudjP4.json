Perfect for friends hangout or a date  - The servers were all wearing masks and would bring hand sanitizer at the table for customers - The cocktails were GREAT. Very flavorful and balanced. The Zephyr one is just prime. - The sushi experiences was excellent. Very fresh, very tasty and the menu selection is varied. Wide choice for Nigiri and Sashimi",

On par with decent places in NYC, and at a lower price. Chef Kevin paced it out nicely. Very relaxed vibe throughout the restaurant.  Main issue was the wait staff. Although friendly, it\u2019s clear that this place doesn\u2019t prioritize the Omakase, so dirty dishes would get piled up as we waited for our waiter to eventually come around. At the end they brought out two desserts, as expected, but then only left one at the table and didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with the other. Moments later we saw the staff eating our other dessert just 10 feet away from us.",

We sat at the bar/hung out around the bar area, as there was almost a 2-hour wait on a Saturday night. Major kudos to the bartender Micah - he was patient, good-spirited, accommodating, and just all-around pleasant - which you don't see often in a DC bartender these days! The mixed drinks were delicious. Top favorites included the Kabuki Springs, the Baldwin, and the Getaway. Our group also tried and ended up buying a bottle of the Nobushi Japanese whiskey - different and good. We ordered the shrimp tempura, gyu don, and several yakitoris including chicken thighs, shishito, shiitake, and beef tongue. All the food was quite good - we kept ordering more of the shishito and chicken thighs! The entire bar/restaurant was very lively the duration of our visit with the second floor extremely lively with karaoke. There's a nice little outdoor area with seating as well. We didn't have to search too long for street parking close by either. The only caveats of Zeppelin - drinks are quite expensive, even for DC. Also, wish there were bathrooms on the first floor - the 2 unisex bathrooms on the 2nd floor made it a hassle. Regardless, we found a new enticing spot in DC - we'd definitely be back!",

The menu is filled with a ton of interesting options; the vegetable tempura did not disappoint.  Drinks: The bartenders knew their whiskey and if they didn't, took the time to taste it with us. Great selection of Japanese whiskeys. They have a fancy sparkling water machine that most of their cocktails take advantage of, so if you're a fan of fizzy drinks you're in the good place.  The cocktails I ordered trended towards sweet-- highly recommend the Zephyr. It's made with Pandan, the taste is undescribable. Just try it.",
