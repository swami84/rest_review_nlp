We ordered from here on a whim and the 5 star review we read on some take out website. We did not go wrong with ordering from here. The food was great. We asked for spicy, and OH, did they give us spicy. (My \"special instructions\" were actually, \"SOOO SPICY!\" to be precise).The vegetarian menu options are superb. There could be more spring rolls with the price you're paying, but I am just a pig when it comes to spring rolls, so I really shouldn't complain. You cannot go wrong eating the food they serve here.",
