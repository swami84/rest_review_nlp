However, they are well aware of my dietary needs and will label everything properly.  Quick story: My office is down the street and I ordered lunch for my coworkers (which included shrimp and pork). When I picked up my order the owner asked if I was feeling okay. That\u2019s how concerned she is about her customers.  Also, this restaurant does not use MSG. And have some great vegetarian options.  The only drawback is I had to give one, is that they are not open on Sundays. But, this is understandable because of the large amount of prep work that I would assume any restaurant has to do.  If you prefer to order via an app, I recommend ordering via DoorDash.",

I found myself in a crunch for time and to tired to fix dinner for my family so decided I'd give it a try because I was already parked right in front and may I add the parking around there is beyond horrible. Initially when I walked up to the counter, there was a lady sitting doing some paperwork, but still by my standards she didn't acknowledged me in a timely manner. As I was about to say excuse me, do you see me standing here she asked me could she help me....hum not a good first impression but decided to give her a hard pass on that. I ordered not expecting much more from the food but was pleasantly surprised to find the food and I mean everything delicious! I will be going back and I just want to add when my order was ready the lady had a  better customer friendly type of attitude.",
