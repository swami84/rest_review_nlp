I had to give up my fish taco to one of the kids who couldn't wait for his 2nd one to come. Drinks are great too. Will definitely return.",

The prices for the dish were extremely fair being in Bayridge. In addition, the taste of the plates were very unexpected in a positive light with a slight kick to traditional Mexican recipes. Even the owner of the business was kind enough to take photos by the decoration with my wife to help promote his business being only a year in town.  My score still stands at 5 stars only to some suggestions to the owner: a recommendation to invest in light dimmers. At times I felt our table was extremely well lit however that didn't really bother me as a diner but it could damper the experience to perhaps a couple going for a romantic ambiance. A second recommendation is to have condiments available at the table. It was unusual that salt, pepper and additional napkins weren't present at each table. My final suggestion is to decorate the restaurant further - the establishment has SOOO much potential. The walls are massive and it appears to be built well so take advantage with more decoration or artwork. Other than that, for a business only a year in town (especially a crummy year at best) I cannot wait to visit once more!",

I will come back often for the fish tacos, chicken mole and octopus tostada.  Anyone that says it\u2019s pricey are probably use to chipotle and Taco Bell. This place is NOT that! Aleli is comparable to authentic/upscale food you find in Mexico City.  Recommendation: could use better ambience lighting indoors and outdoors. Hire more staff, I saw a few people walk away because they were not acknowledged or seated right away. Understandable though! The waiters were so swamped.",

Then coronavirus hit, and I thought they might not be back. When they re-opened, they had drastically changed their menu, for the better imho. I\u2019ve had quite a few of their dishes, and just the other day I had their burrito, which is what prompted this review. It was one of the best burritos I\u2019ve ever had! Their chicken mole poblano, their chicken adobado, their tacos (I\u2019ve had all of them except the chorizo), guacamole are all excellent. I wish they included beans with the adobado dish in particular, but this is a small complaint. They are friendly and food is fresh and very tasty. Bay Ridge has a few Mexican restaurants and a Cali Mexican restaurant in Hobrah, but in my opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant in Bay Ridge...by far. You owe it to yourself to try them out.",

I need more! But the coconut flan was rich dense and smooth. Good flavor and popped amaranth which is a treat. I got the spicy guacamole. Because guacamole, duh. They fry up the chips there. Perfect thickness and salt. Loved the guac. So many textures and flavor. A very nice blend. It's not very spicy either. Next was the memelita. This was a pleasant surprise. The shell here was made from scratch and grilled. It held up well to the vegetables and sauce. Beans were tender and creamy. Squash and mushrooms all came together with robust flavor. Def worth it. Does not need any meat at all to stand on its own. The chicken enchilado. Boneless thigh crispy fried. The meat has great flavor, no simple marinade here. A bouquet of bite sized Vegetable medley (purslane, cauliflower, fresh roasted corn, perfect carmelized Pearl onions, broccolini, roasted potatoes) with the most beautiful Chipotle sauce I've ever experienced. They won't share the recipe tho, this makes me sad. I did watch it get prepared but missed all the ingredients Being added. Its rich, floral, delicate, not overly Smokey or hot. I would put this sauce on everything. It makes me want to try every one of their sauces, which I plan to do soon. Yes. It's pricey. But. Every piece of produce was fresh and crisp . Every single Berry on my dessert was perfect, not a hint of age, no black, no mush, no mold and all sweet. You might wanna say it's luck, but not dead winter. Plus they're open 7 days a week.",

We tried the guacamole and a few of the tacos. My girlfriend and I both loved the steak ones. And of course I had to drink a Tamarind Jarrito.. so good! To finish, we ordered the coconut flan. Incredible. The prices are not bad at all. Service was also very friendly and courteous. Thanks for an amazing dinner, we'll be back soon!",
