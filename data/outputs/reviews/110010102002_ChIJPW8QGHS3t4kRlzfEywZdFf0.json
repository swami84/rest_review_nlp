In actuality, they were medium to large, at best. They were a whopping $80/dozen!!!! I had 4 people eating crabs and figured 5+/- a person with the intention to avoid any wasted leftovers. I asked if he would give me 20 crab and price them individually. He agreed but clearly his math skills are questionable at best. He said $140. I agreed thinking there was some sort of up charge for not ordering in segments of a dozen. He starts to fill the bag with crabs, even put an obviously dead one on there. I get annoyed but don\u2019t say anything. Luckily, i\u2019m also counting the crab as they\u2019re deposited into the bag. He stops at 18. I decide to intervene at this point because I\u2019m now $19 in the hole. I mention that I counted 18, he mumbled something inaudible under his breath and puts two more crab in the bag. When he turns around to grab the claim ticket given to me for cooking, he says something to his coworker - they both turn to me and start laughing. Immediately, I feel uncomfortable and start questioning whether I miscounted or was annoying to them. THEN, as I was waiting, another patron came to collect her cooked crab and quickly discovered her crabs were accidentally given to someone else. She freaked out, understandably, considering it takes 20+ minutes to steam a batch of crab. The situation escalated quickly with choice words thrown back and forth from each party. Then I hear the cook yell from the back \u201cshut the f*#k up.\u201d Obviously, this infuriated her even more. I literally thought they were going to start physically fighting. I felt like I was on an episode of Jerry Springer. Unreal! I know there is some affiliation between this place and  Jessie Taylor\u2019s or Captain Whites. Maybe both, I\u2019m not sure. Anyway, my point is - if you go here, tread carefully and COUNT YOUR CRAB before they\u2019re cooked. When I got home, I emptied the bag on the table and counted 20 crab. Literally - your job is to count crab and calculate the total of purchased goods. You failed miserably at both (or you\u2019re trying to rip me off). BEWARE OF THIS PLACE! You won\u2019t find me back there, that\u2019s for sure.",
