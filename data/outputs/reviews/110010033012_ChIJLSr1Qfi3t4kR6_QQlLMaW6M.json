During those visits, they usually were very attentive and seemed to value their patrons. We generally have drinks and dinners and while a bit expensive, both have been great in the past.  Today the staff and servers were very attentive but it was hard to overcome the bad taste in my mouth after their hostess held a table at opening (when no one was in the restaurant other than staff and I). She snidely deemed \u201creserved\u201d required my mom to be wheeled to the other end of the restaurant which was very hard for her.(Note: the table remained empty until after we left).  Ah well. More wine and dine venues pop up every week in Eckington, NoMA and Brookland and I\u2019m sure they and other restaurants nearby will want our patronage more than that in the future. So those are where we will go moving forward.",

Having experience in hospitality, you dont really throw out a full box of food- u kind of wait a little to see if they would come back. Yeap there goes half of my frittata and half of my bf's smoked salmon benedict, literally worth a full meal.

However, the seasonings and sides were all pretty simple. Easy enough to make the same at home for quite less. Don't consider wine; way over priced, even for DC. Nice to pop in for a drink maybe, but a dinner experience will cost too much.",

Just off the main street, Tyber Creek Wine Bar and Kitchen is a restaurant with a bar, outdoor seating, and indoor dining. My wife and I met a colleague here for Sunday brunch and left impressed.  We went at 1PM for brunch (Brunch ends at 3PM) and we didn't need a reservation. We were seated at one of their wooden booths. Of course we started with the cast iron cinnamon rolls. Five giant cinnamon rolls come out warm from the oven with the cream cheese frosting slightly melting down the sides. It's mouth watering!  For our main course, I ordered the asparagus frittata. If you want a veggie forward dish, order this. It was good as frittatas come. My wife ordered the shakshuka and enjoyed it. My colleague ordered the bibb lettuce salad with chicken and it was filling!  On top of the food, the service was attentive and the owners even came over to say hi. They are super nice making the environment even more bright!",
