I really really want to like this place - the vibe inside is super chill, the service is really friendly and pleasant, and the patio is great, especially in the evening after work.  Sadly, the food is quite low quality for the price and the drinks are quite over priced and watered down. My wife had two drinks and is a super light weight and she said she barely felt anything. The food seems like it\u2019s chronically over cooked, not burned, but definitely drier than it is should be. I love bbq and I\u2019ve had it all over, maybe it\u2019s a different style here, but idk...  Like I said, I really want to like this place, and know it\u2019s Covid, but all three times I was kinda bummed out when I was leaving because I was left disappointed with the quality and price of the food and drinks...",

The coleslaw was incredibly bland (there\u2019s no way it isn\u2019t just cabbage and mayonnaise); the sweet pickles on top were a saving grace but there were too few. The mac had WAY too much breadcrumbs on top. The pulled pork sandwich wasn\u2019t pulled and didn\u2019t have the signature texture I look for in a pulled pork sandwich. I\u2019m still not sure if I didn\u2019t get the brisket sandwich instead. Overall disappointing, ESPECIALLY the sides, which, for $14, are too overpriced for no flavor.",

My bestie and hubby poured the bourbon over their brisket and said it gave it a smokey fiery flavor. The pudding corn is basically very sweet cornbread with pieces of corn in it. Highly recommend! I was not a fan of pork puppies, too fried, and it was more like mashed potatoe consistency inside didnt really taste any pork, wouldn't recommend. The mac and cheese was delish. I didnt like the inside venue, too dark and felt like a sauna, I'd definitely would come back for the brisket but would do take out instead of dining in. The guy who waited on us was friendly and offered us the corn pudding because we disliked the pork puppies, great customer service! Way better than honky tonk bbq in pilsen.",

Not a fan of the new layout, but that is a personal opinion and can be overlooked if the food was good. The food was not good. The ribs were ok, but nothing I cant get many other places in Chicago. The brisket was just not very edible. It was hard to cut and chew. The exact opposite of how brisket should be. The mac and cheese had exactly no flavor. The only thing we ordered that tasted the same was the corn pudding. We hope they are just going through an adjustment curve. We will try again and update, but feel that it was not at all worth the 2.5 year wait.  UPDATE: gave it another shot yesterday on a beautiful Saturday. Sat on the new patio. Food was AMAZING. Everything was back to how we remembered. We got 6 sides, a brisket sandwich, brisket, and a half rack of ribs. We are in love again and cannot wait to go back!",

Our first time was an awesome experience and we will definitely be back.  Ordered 2 entrees and 3 sides and each one was delicious.  The 1/2 chicken was perfectly smoked and the pulled pork sandwich seriously hit the spot.  The corn pudding and pork puppies were probably our favorite.  That along with great cocktails and beer and I don\u2019t know what else you\u2019d want out of a neighborhood BBQ joint.  Would love to see the addition of waiters at some point but that didn\u2019t detract from our experience at all.  Staff was friendly and gave great recommendations.  Come and try it!",

Its a virtually new establishment but still a great place to get some much better than average eats in a casual (but not cheap) setting.  This was my first visit back to the old namesake and, since I had the place all to myself in the middle of a shift change, I didn't get a real feel for the vibe or service but the food was excellent. The brisket was flavorful and (mostly) melt in my mouth tender, the sausage was firm and bursting in homemade goodness and the greens were as good, if not better than, Mr. Williams' (is he still closeby or did he leave recipes?).  I will be back.",

The place was empty but we decided to give it a try and glad we did! The rib tips, greens, smoked chicken, and corn pudding were amazing. The mac and cheese lacked flavor and was undercooked. Even a little salt and pepper didn't help it so will skip that next time. The hot links were ok...seemed they could have been smoked/cooked longer. The lemonade was delicious. Sam assisted us and was so friendly and kind and even let us sample the brisket per our request which we will definitely order next time. The cook came out and let us sample the pork hush puppies which was amazing. The brisket was tender,  juicy and flavorful. This place is a must try if you're in the area and looking for some good BBQ. It's worth it. We will be going back!!!",

We hung around for a while watching the firefighters work. It was dramatic.  Since then, I had been dying for the place to reopen so we could go back and relive the wonderful experience and reorder the food we didn't get to finish.  Today, we finally went back and it was underwhelming.  1. It is now counter style ordering. No table service. i.e. no friendly waitress/waiter telling you the specials or recommendations.  2. The prices are too high for no good reason. i.e. $12 for Texas Brisket (small portion and plain; no sides, no nothing) and $5 for a mediocre-sized portion of sweet potato fries.  3. Apparently, they no longer participate with the Wisely app.  4. The food does not taste the same. Definitely not as delicious as it used to be.  I could have lived with the new layout if they delivered on everything else. However, given the pricing and flavor changes, I will not go out of my way (I live in Oak Lawn) to visit County. I will stick to local barbecue joints where I can get better food for much less.",

I had the smoked chicken sandwich, Mac and cheese, and pork puppies. The chicken was good! Was it the best smoked chicken ever? No. It was juicy, and well seasoned which is the main concern. The BBQ sauce elevated it well. The sauce is a unique blend that is extremely different for the region that I haven't had before. Spicy blows house away in my mind. When they spicy, they mean hot. It's equal to a jalapenos bite, but it a great compliment to the flavors.  The Mac and cheese at a glance honestly looks subpar, but the cheeses they used to make the sauce compliment it well. The noodles were cooked perfectly, a solid piece in addition to the menu.  The pork puppies were my favorite part of the meal. They were by far the best hush puppy I have ever had in all of my lifetime. I would come back here simply for those alone. The sauce that is served with it is somehow a bit sour and tangy and was absolutely phenomenal. My only complaint towards this establishment was the prices of the side dishes. For 5 dollars each, or 3 for 12, it still feels like you barely get anything for the price paid. While they are high quality ingredients it still was a bit pricey.  It could be simply just because of the location, but is still is how I feel. Overall, so far the best BBQ spot I've found and I can't wait to continue to try new things on the menu.",

By advertisement and reviews there was no indication that this is more bar and very little restaurant. Had we known this before walking in for a late lunch on a Tuesday afternoon,  we would not have taken our one-year old child. Since it is more bar than anything,  the menu was limited,  except for the mile long drinks list.  We ordered garlic fries, brisket sandwiches and mac and cheese for the baby. The baby wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese but like us, she thought the garlic fries were awesome!  The brisket sandwich was a bit zesty, but good. They carry many local craft brews which is always great if you are into that. The music was a good fit for the atmosphere, somewhere along the lines of garage rock maybe punk rock? Either way, it was good and the baby really got into it. Overall,  it is a nice place to visit without your children, unless early exposure to bar life is on par with your parenting style.  If you are in your 20's or like to pretend to be,  and if you like craft beer and garlic fries, give it a try.",

The smoked bacon bar bites, BLT sliders and brisket chili are mouth-watering. Texas Brisket is delicious and melts in your mouth.  The Chicago rib tips and garlic fries are good too.  I didn\u2019t care for the fried green tomatoes.  They were a little salty.  I would recommend \u201cA Taste of County BBQ\u201d platter to sample a few different menu items.   Highly recommended!",

        "caption": "I stopped here after discovering Honkey Tonk BBQ didn't open until 4pm. Had a taste for beef brisket and KNEW I wasn't going to get outside and make my own. After reading the previous reviews I opted for the brisket sandwich and fried green tomatoes. Service was VERY friendly and the restaurant is very nice and quaint. Bar looked to have a nice selection of beers as well.  Seeing as such I hate to say anything negative about the place however I feel the previous reviews are a bit misleading. The brisket sandwich is SMALL, I'm used to going to a bbq place and if I'm paying $9 bucks for a sandwich, I expect it to be good for one and big for $9.... The brisket itself is decently smoky but it is very dry, and the portion I don't even think is /was a 1/4lb. All the sauces are meh as I tried all three. The mustard is deccent if you like mustard sauce, the spicy to me tastes best of all three, the house sauce just tastes strange as it has ALOT of terragon in it. Maybe thats what is throwing me off as I am not used to terragon in BBQ anywhere Ive had BBQ, and Ive been to alot of joints. The ciabatta roll is a nice touch, but if you think about the size of a standard roll you can picture the amount of meat I'm talking about when I say it definitely did not overtake the little ciabatta roll.  The garlic fries we're definitely the pinnacle of my experience, flavorful, perfectly salted and fried to a crunchy awesomeness. The fried green tomatoes on the other hand....  I have absolutely no idea what the other person was talking about, although decent they are nothing to write home about. First of all, so you know...  You only get THREE slices of tomato (with a side of goat cheese for dipping ) for SIX dollars. I don't know about you, but to me, I feel hoodwinked, led astray and run amuck for paying $2 per slice of tomato. Although the service and atmosphere are nice, food is key so I simply cannot recommend this place seeing all of the other great BBQ joints in the city. Maybe a good addition to the area but just not for me.",

The Little Italy neighborhood is a hike for me since I live on the north side, but it was totally worth it.  I went during it's grand opening week and the wait wasn't bad, which is surprising because it's quite small inside.  The food is a great addition to the Chicago barbeque scene.  My ribs were cooked perfectly and I mean PERFECTLY!  They were tender and just fell right off the bone.  We also started with the wedge salad.  It's not your typical wedge salad, so don't be surprised, but it was also really good.  The only thing I think they could work on is their housemade barbeque sauces, they were not my favorite.  I definitely recommend venturing to Little Italy and checking this restaurant out.",
