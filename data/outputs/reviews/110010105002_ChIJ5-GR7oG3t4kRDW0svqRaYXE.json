The food itself tastes fine, but my issue is with the quantity of food given, the prices, and the staff.  I got tired of getting rude stares anytime I asked for extra of a certain topping, or to substitute one topping for another. They also tend to speak poorly about customers in Spanish, assuming they don't understand, so I've caught quite a few comments made about me.  But I think the worst is the quantity of food you get for the hefty prices. The manager seems to have specifically cautioned the staff from giving customers a fair amount of food. Today, I paid $11 for a salad. I watched as she put 5 pieces of romaine, 1/4 of an egg, 1.5 slices of bacon, and 1/8 of an avocado in my bowl. When it came time to add the egg/blue cheese, she poured half of her spoon back out into the container before putting any on my salad. They charge a ridiculous amount for substitutions or extra salad dressing. And there was the one occasion they gave me raw/under cooked chicken on my salad.  Apparently, they were much better than this before they came under new management. You can get more for your buck at any of the other surrounding restaurants, and maybe not have someone mocking you or ignoring you as you try to order.",

I frequently go in the mornings on the way to work for my usuals (i.e., bagel w/cream cheese on the side and a side of bacon; egg white western omelet; or bagel w/cream cheese on the side a side of turkey bacon).  They only thing consistent is that my order is never right.  It's very frustrating and once I reach the highest level of annoyance, I discontinue going for a while.  But, then I am reminded once I go back how annoyed I am with their service.  The only reason I go back is because they are the only cafe on my way into work that has what I enjoy eating in the morning.  Today, I got a bagel w/cream cheese on the side and as usual, she slapped the cream cheese on the bagel.  I immediately said, \"Slow down, what's the rush. I told you when I placed my order cream cheese on the side.\" She also interrupted me as I am placing my order, so much that I couldn't even tell her a side a bacon.  I had to tell someone else behind the counter the rest of my order.  The food preparers need to SLOW DOWN.  I would rather you listen to my order and get it right, then try to rush me through and get it wrong.  It is not good customer service.  They also do not speak good english, which is part of the communication barrier.  So, today I will stop going again and find a new cafe to give my business to.",

This isn't a problem regulars seemed to have as everything was just waiting for them and staff prepared their orders as they saw them enter , causing a new person like me to wait longer than needed.  The food looked good, but i didnt get any because of bad service so its just visual. my latte was burnt. A lady behind me was given a huge attitude because she just wanted a muffin and tried to charge it. The staff freely spoke bad about customers in Spanish, either assuming nobody but themselves can understand, or just adding to the general bad service.  It's worth noting that other people around me seemed to like the place and if you stick it out and become a regular all the problems appear to disappear. But for me? Not worth going back to. That says a lot since I have a rule in general that every new place gets two tries, since sometimes they can just be having a bad day (new hires, short staffed, manager sick, etc etc). I don't think that's the case here.",
