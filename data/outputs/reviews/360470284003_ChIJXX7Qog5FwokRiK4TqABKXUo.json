Rice rolls are basically like hand rolls, in a way, but usually with cooked ingredients, purple rice, and other ingredients of the restaurant's choice. Here, the rice is always soft and they very carefully roll the rice roll together. I tried the kimchi beef rice roll and the eel rice roll. I definitely prefer the eel, but that's because the kimchi's flavor was overwhelming and salty compared to everything else and it was essentially kimchi and rice. Not bad though, definitely a decent place (only place really) to grab some rice rolls by 86th. I'll definitely be coming back again and again for that rice roll fix.",

The filling is made of eel, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, and a secret sauce to make the current rice ball. At first glance, it looks a bit like sushi. After a bite, it turns out not to be Chinese.
