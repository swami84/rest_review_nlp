If you're used to frozen hardware store pizza, you may enjoy this. If you have any idea what pizza is, dont waste your time. I believe there's a gas station nearby that serves better pizza.",

No smile or response when I said thank you. Restaurant is in a great location and we were glad to try St Louis style pizza.

I thought I would try the proven cheese bites which were your basic cheese bites nothing amazing but better than the bread for sure. Our pizza of choice was pepperoni and sausage. First of all all of their pizza is thin crust so if you prefer a different type of crust take that into consideration.

My mom, her friend and I all went here, and my mom and her friend worked to order some of their cheese as a literal Christmas present for me. With a 5 pound block of cheese in hand, even the pizza's i made at home with it (which were still so enhanced by the cheese) couldn't compare to what i've had here.

The wait staff weren't very friendly but can deal with that.  We actually had three separate pizza orders.   The first one came out fairly quickly but still hadn't gotten our salads  or ravioli.  The gentleman said it would be right out.   Waited another 20 minutes for them to come out.   In the mean  the other wait staff asked if we had anything else coming out.   We said yes, two more pizzas.  They again asked what kind.   Our total wait for the pizzas was over an hour and a half and then we got dirty looks because they were setting up for the next morning's brunch and we weren't done eating.   Needless to say, we will never patronize that Imo's ever again.",

However, this was not my favorite pizza.  Now, I love pizza and consider it one of my four food groups. Chicago deep dish, NY style, Japanese pizza with corn and mayo, and Gigi's my hometown favorite in St. Pete, FL all are delicious, (but especially Gigi's) are near and dear to my heart.  This not a criticism of Imo's or any St. Louis pizzeria it's just the provene cheese (which is like a block of government provolone) they use is not very good and leaves a residue in your mouth that required two gooey butter cakes to remove (see that review later). In fact my wife stated this was the first time I have ever left the last slice for her to eat.  If in St. Louis you have to try it. But be prepared for a uniquely gooey, plastic, flavorless pizza that stays with you for hours.",

        "caption": "First, to respond to some of the comments on the \"processed\" and greasy cheese: all cheese is process and has varying levels of greasy.  If you don't want processed/greasy cheese, then pizza in general is probably not for you. The cheese is called Provel cheese and it's a cheese that's a mix of swiss, provolone, and cheddar; its very popular in St. Louis so its a local taste (if you want to eat local, then try it; if not, then don't).  I find the cooled pizza version to be softer and creamier than normal pizza cheese.  I LOVE it.  When its hot, you can't really tell the texture of the cheese since its all so melted/hot.  Second, the location: it is hard to find if you're following google maps or waze because its in the bottom floor of the Hilton hotel.  So, walk in the front of the hotel and ask for directions for it.  Or, if you want to get some steps in, walk the entire block of the Hilton until you find it.  Walk through the hotel and you'll see lots of Cardinals memorabilia including a large board with a bunch of older players' cards (see attached).  It's nice to have an Imo's in downtown for games, visits to the museums, the Arch, etc.  I like not having to leave my parking spot to get some Imo's when I'm already downtown seeing sights.  Third, the price: It is expensive.  But, in my opinion, it's worth it.  I don't live here, but getting some Imo's when I'm in town is worth the price.  If I wanted a whatever 5.99 pizza, I could always go elsewhere.  Fourth, the non pizza items like salads and toasted raviolis:  The salads did come with a decent amount of white lettuce, as other reviews explain.  But, we had both a cesar and house salad and both were tasty.  We forgot to ask for chicken on the cesar, but the cashier who took our order ended up giving it to us later when we went back up to purchase just the chicken as a side.  GREAT customer service!!!! Toasted ravioli was so good, we went back for a second order. You get about 10 pieces in each order.  Fifth, the thin crust: If you don't like thin crust, then definitely go somewhere else (like Chicago).  Imo's is known for their thin crust.  I love thin crust and this was perfect.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of it because we ate it so quickly, that it was gone before I could snap one!  We got the extra large, 16\" pizza and it fed a family of 4.",

It's an order at the counter and they bring it to your table kind of place. Pretty basic and not very friendly customer service (not good but not terrible).  We are from MN where the St. Louis style pizza (thin crust, greasy, cut into small squares) is very popular, so we knew what we were getting into. We love that style of pizza, but unfortunately Imo's did not make the grade.  It was the greasiest pizza we have ever had. We tried to blot it with our napkins which turned into a disaster.  I liked that the crust was crispy.  The provel cheese has a very odd taste that is not very pleasing. It reminded me of cheap frozen pizza from a gas station.  The garlic bread was a little stale and over baked and did not come with any sauce.  I get that everyone's hometown thinks they have the best and most unique pizza around, however this was not good and not worth the price. We will not be back.",

Toppings were substandard and scarce (which I guess is a good thing in this case). My daughter ordered lasagna which was worse than the frozen stuff you can buy in the freezer section of Kroger's. Garlic bread was a soggy, greasy mess with no garlic taste. Caesar salad was obviously poured from a bag of lettuce with some bottled dressing squirted in to a plastic cup, a handful of tasteless croutons thrown on top. Save your money and eat somewhere else.

The pizza was a literal disaster.  The sogginess of the the bread, the disgusting creamy sauce, and the toppings were straight out of a horror film.  The check-in lady at Budget HIGHLY recommended this establishment, and I would say shame on her.",
