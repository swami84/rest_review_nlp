The galbi over kimchi fried rice was super and we enjoyed all the different components of a well made bimbimbap.

Also, the Pajeon could have been a bit crisper, but the flavors in both were great and the Bulgogi Taco was amazing! Perhaps you can have an individual add on cause I could have eaten 4!!!
