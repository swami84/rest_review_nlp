Phil met me at the front door with my order immediately. Got home to an incredibly tender and flavorful batch of ribs (zesty style). My wife couldn\u2019t help but ask for some (there was a lot) and even she, who really doesn\u2019t care for ribs, was over the moon about how tender and flavorful they are.  I wish I had asked about the sides (I didn\u2019t) but based on the BBQ ribs I can tell you that this is truly genuine southern barbecue and I\u2019ll go back again and again.",
