The guys behind the back were friendly and said we could sit anywhere. Plenty of seating, including outdoor seats, with more on the 84th street side so it wasn't as busy. We sat inside by the window. Server was helpful. Food came out fast. Nice portions. We started the roasted pepper hummus. Great flavor, and everything came with pita chips so we had an abundance of that. The horiatiki salad was your classic Greek salad. No lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, wedges of feta. There were capers but.. I could have done without. That's my preference and next time I'll ask for it without. Something notable is it was a little light on the dressing but all the flavors came from the onions and tomatoes. And capers... We got the Greek fries. I don't know how but Mos tof the feta actually stuck to the fries. A nice touch compared to other places just sprinkling feta after the fact and it ending up on the bottom of the basket. Still had feta on the bottom, but there were some nice fries with feta melted on it. I had a kotobacon stick. That was tasty and flavorful. I was somewhat annoyed when another customer asked that their food not be cooked around pork or bacon. When they were told that would be difficult because pork and bacon are cooked on the grill the woman asked they try their best. I'm glad they came to somewhat of a compromise but if you have dietary restrictions you should also be mindful of the places you go. But it's your money... I had the lamb beef platter with rice and my girlfriend had a chicken gyro. Both good. The platter came with salad already (Argh! I always order salads that I could get for free) and the meat and rice were seasoned well. The gyro had fries in it. Am I the only one that thinks fries in sandwiches and rolls and the like is literally filler? Overall I liked it. Prices were fair. One last thing since it's on my mind, the plates and stuff were really cool. Hefty and could take a beating. As a final note, I gave it a 4 because the food was good and service was great but I wouldn't drive out here just for this place. That's partially laziness. And partially because I could get the same quality nearby. A 4 is still a good rating. A lot of people think they're 5s and are actually 2s so let's not overthink things.",

It appears before you even stipulated you were paying with card, so if you're paying cash you're supposed to do math I guess? Sure we got phone calcs. Make sure you read your check.  That's not enough for 2 stars, but the lack of noticeable air conditioning is one. I get it, 90f and humid. But because of this there's flies everywhere landing on /everything/. It's unsanitary. Especially as the food was open to the air and flies behind the counter.  This is all easily changeable, but what's not is the dry meat. Also the smaller portions vs the pix on Yelp. The pita was fresh, the tzatziki was bland, the salad was sparse. The spinach pie had a few layers of fyllo, and it was super dry and tough. The filling didn't taste fresh at all.",

This is not the case with almost every other business on the planet. They don't even tell you about it until you see it pop up on the register as a \"service charge\". It only comes out to 56 cents or so on top of your order, but it is the deceptive principle behind it that makes me SMH. All other businesses (even small local ones) have either a debit or credit minimum to make it profitable to sell their products using a card, without shadily passing the fee on to the customers, and only when you get to the register. I asked the employee at the register about it, and he only replied \"they don't want to pay for it\". Yeah, guess what, customers don't want to pay for it either, we're already paying inflated prices for your food. The food is pretty decent, nothing to write home about. But the fact that these shady, underhanded practices of nickle-and-diming customers for using a card is unacceptable, they should be ashamed. At the very least, they should be up-front about charging you, the customer, extra money for the \"privilege\" of using a debit or credit card. What is this, 1985 and most people pay for food with cash?",

Second, third and final time which brings me to this review, the service is horrible. They have bunch of high schoolers who stand right in front of your table chatting and talking completely ignoring the customer for any type of need. Took us 15 mins to order and all 7-8 workers were standing in a circle just talking. And when we stated can someone take our order the response was even more discomforting. I felt unwelcomed and frankly money wasted, I don\u2019t care how good your food is. Any succesful customer service place knows that you can easily turn one bad experience to amazing but this place workers went extra mile to make it worst.",

Their gyros are so juicy, their Greek sauces are all amazing, the French fries were crispy, the Bifteki is so juicy, and their sausage as well.The Greek sodas were also nice.The manager made sure we were satisfied.

I was given the end tips of the pork instead the nice meaty pieces like you get in the truck.

We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, the place was packed with people eating in and getting orders to go.  Once we were seated, ordered our food and it was served, I was thrilled to taste the same exact wonderful tastes in the foods that I used to travel 30 miles to get.  The food here is fantastic, the people as friendly as can be and the prices for the quality and taste of what is served, can't be beat ANYWHERE !
