        "caption": "SERVICE HORRIBLE. The waitress (Claudia) literally got angry at us for her not doing her job. It wasnt even a big issue. We showed our student IDs to two different waitresses for student discount. The waitress who was actually in charge of our table probably didnt see the IDs. But we are pretty sure that she saw our IDs. She came back and yelled at us. No exaggeration. I mean, how difficult is it to get us a fixed bill? Is it something to get angry over? What right did she have to get angry at us when we showed nothing but respect?! When we were talking in Korean, she angrily asked us what we were talking about. She was very insecure that we might have been talking about her. We werent even really talking about her. Even if we did, she did not have the right to do that. She told us that we were wasting her time, while she was the one who took more than 20 minutes to get us the bill. She also said that we were treating her badly. Haha. We never disrespected her in any ways. We never said bad things. She refused to admit and talk to us and just blamed everything on us. The manager apologized on her behalf. But this has ruined my perception of this place. I probably wont be going back. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible! This waitress kept frowning at other people too. I mean, who does that?! If you are looking for a nice jazz club that you want to enjoy, avoid this one. Not worth the money.",
