They do great cocktails, the food rarely disappoints, the interior is nice and cozy when there isn't covid, and the patio is small but charming and great for an alfresco meal in the summer. I deducted a star because the service is consistently bad and has been for as long as I can remember. The wait staff seems to have no sense of organization and regularly forgets to take your order, doesn't check on you for long periods of time,or you get different servers waiting in the same table causing confusion. If it's busy you might want to skip the service headaches and go somewhere else but as long as it's not too crowded the cocktails, food and ambience are worth the service gamble.",

During our dining experience we found a hair in our oysters, waited 15 min for the server to come to the table to bring the issue to his attention; The server did apologized that was it, a simple and vague apology. After this terrible experience I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be coming back, and I recall stating that the food is great and indeed it is, but the portions are designed for a 9 year old and the price doesn\u2019t match it.",

No one called back so when I called THEM back, the answer from the guy on the phone was \u201cHe picked up the wrong food. Sorry.\u201d So I guess that\u2019s it? They make a mistake and good luck? No offer to help, send me the correct food, nothing. Cool restaurant man, good luck with it. There\u2019s WAY better places that have opened up on Cortelyou AND they are nice. The food smelled awful anyway - don\u2019t order the chicken sandwich. Yes it was the wrong order but it looked disgusting, soggy.",

We were the only people at the restaurant and it took 45 minutes to tell me the chef had issues with the Hollandaise  sauce which is super easy to make. They asked if i wanted to order something else or just replace hollandaise with guacamole.  Since my husbands order was already ready i was just put some guacamole.  He is half done with his cold (expensive disgusting burger) and i am still waiting for my food. Finally my food arrives, the salmon was missing, guacamole was on only one piece of toast and poached eggs were raw and disgusting looking. I returned my food  and my husband couldn't finish the raw cold burner (request medium well doneness) with cold fries. How this place is considered excellent when they cannot make poached eggs and hollandaise sauce is ridiculous. It took over an hour to get everything on the table and we could not even eat the food and had to walk out.",

The mussels smelled strongly, to the point where we wondered if they had gone bad: their taste was subpar but at least not rotten. The chicken wings were dry with mediocre flavor, and even the chips seemed overcooked! It was so disappointing, we really couldn't believe how bad it was, and how expensive for the quality and quantity of food. Next time we'll just stick to the drinks!",

The boozy brunch which was great value for around $20 for unlimited booze! Definately worth a visit if you fancy cocktails and a good environment.",

The potatoes are mealy and bland, the mesclun has no dressing of any kind. Everything is just kind of blah. I hope they go back to their old, more flavorful cooking style. I don't think we'll come much anymore.  I generally like this place. The interior design is very pleasing, and the food is good. The music is good but too loud, so I end up going less often than I would like to. It's hard to talk over.  12/2017 edit: The music volume during weekend brunch has been tolerable for the last few times we've been. It's nice to be able to talk without shouting. Thank you, I hope you keep it this way!",

They had a deal for shot & beer for $8 which wasn't bad. All in all, in conclusion, it  wasn't worth the $82 bucks I spent for 2 people. This is a place you take a date on.
