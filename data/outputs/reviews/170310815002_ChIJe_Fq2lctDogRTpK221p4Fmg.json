The arancini was well flavored with a hint of gorgonzola. In the entrees, we got the ravioli made in lemon butter which was definitely new and unique for me. The pizza alla norma was well made and I love alla norma.",

Since Spring 2020, they have not consistently shipped monthly wine boxes but continue to charge the credit card monthly. I have called the wine department 1-2 times a month since Spring 2020 to check in on why wine shipments have not been coming and there has been no consistent answer, other than a complete lack of customer service and retention.  I am disappointed. The wines they choose are quite good but the lack of communication and inability to understand, appreciate, and present a solution to a simple problem speaks volumes to the level of excellence provided. A monthly based subscription service should not require 1-2 separate phone calls a month to remind them to send a shipment out.  Over the course of a year, I have spoken with Jamie, Kaitlin, and Julian. I hope the passion the staff has for wine can translate over into customer service and providing solutions to simple problems",

Eataly was a simple bus or el ride downtown.  The gelato was always perfect, the wines are great, the chocolate, charcuterie, pizza, and of course coffee. I miss you like I miss that one girl that broke my heart into a million pieces, but she was my first love and I can still remember our last time together.  Damn you Eataly.",

        "caption": "Tl;dr: Restaurant wait staff were very judgemental and no one could simply warm bread.  The workers in the restaurants upstairs appear to not care about doing their job. I was there on the late side for dinner, but not so late that there weren't a fair number of other people sitting and eating. First off, I walked up to one of the islands, something like \"Osteria\" and the cooks behind the glass panel were just having a loud conversation and completely obviously to me. There was no one else around so finally had to say \"excuse me, do I just sit down?\" And they said oh a server will come take care of me. So I pull out a chair and a server steps over. (Did I really need to signal by sitting down and they had no clue by me standing there and wandering around?) I already knew what I wanted, which was the pasta with beef cheek filling. I asked if I could swap the butter sauce for a red one. The server was like uhhh I mean we don't really do that, but I can assure you the butter sauce is flavorful enough if that's what you're worried about. I said I had been to Eataly in Los Angeles, and also had a very similar dish and they originally suggested to me I swap out for red sauce according to my preferences. Server still said oh I don't know about that but just left it as \"well I gotta take the butter sauce\". Literally how hard is it to swap a sauce at EATALY. I wasn't asking for a sauce with truffles. Any. Red. Sauce.  Bread came cold. And I mean fridge cold not room temp. At the other Eataly, it came heated just like nearly ever restaurant ever. No one was bothering to check in or even walking near my island. So had to wait until finally someone walked near enough to ask for my bread heated. This person said oh I don't know how to do that and promptly walked away. I assumed she was going to get someone else. nope, just walked away.  Flagged down another guy who also said he didn't know how to do that, but would go find his manager. By now I've finished my pasta. He doesn't come back for ages so I presume he forgot. I get up and walk to an island where my server is standing. Say that I've requested my bread be warmed but have been ignored. She looks at me as if I'm insane wanting my bread warmed and says sorry I don't know how to do that. Ok, i go back to my spot and the other guy comes back having asked his manager to take my bread and warm it. Then the server, she comes back with a bowl of different bread cut at odd angles saying oh I found this room temperature bread. I say, other guy took care of it and is warming it. She is surprised and astonishly says again oh welp I didn't know you could do that.  I should mention that all this time other servers and wait staff are just clumped together in random spots hooting and hollering, having loud conversations and not bothering to check on guests. I get it, there aren't that many customers around. But there were at least ten tables, so have some courtesy.  This Eataly location is truly upsetting and the service is really subpar. The fact that nobody knows how to warm bread is really sad. They made me feel like I was weird for requesting warm bread, and only one person went out of their way to figure it out. I am not a picky eater or confrontational person by any means. But even McDonald's knows how to serve warm bread.  At least the employees working in the chocolate department were nice, though mildly uninformed. One lady told me that it was $3 for a box of chocolates based off a sign. I literally questioned her multiple times as she pointed to different boxes saying oh I think this is the $3 box. She asked someone else who finally confirmed as I expected that $3 is just for the box, no chocolates.  Eataly is one of my favorite places in LA. This is just too bad.",

Chances are more likely than not, that if you're making an Italian meal, whatever you want, they've got.  Also a fantastic selection of Italian wines, from table wine, to Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino, Amarone, whatever it is, if it is Italian, it most likely can be found there.  As I look at a few reviews of the place that downgrade it for petty reasons, I CAUTIONS readers, when you see bad reviews, and the reviewer has only done a few total reviews, have a look at their profile.  Chances are, no matter where they go, they either give FIVE STARS or ONE star.  And they seldom have much to say about why.  Eataly was a really great trip for me and my partner on our first time in Chicago where we got a suite with our own kitchen so we could make some meals ourselves.  Bought some excellent cheeses, charcuterie, and even a few top notch bottles of Italian wine for laying down.  It is pricey, but QUALITY doesn't come cheap.",

We got the mains when we we still eating the Appetizer so they were cold wenn we have finished the starters. bread came just after we have almost finished the Appetizer. When the waiter placed the food on the table I told them, that we are still with our starters. He just replied that the kitchen will close soon. No further comments, nothing. Officially the kitchen was still 15 min and Eataly over one hour open. In general, the atmosphere was quite bad as all people were cleaning up quite loudly.  Was a bad experience, especially when you spend 50 bugs in 30 min for cold food.",

The waiter took 10 minutes to come and then all he said was \"are we ready to order?\" Then he seemed more concerned about whether we had any allergies to the food we ordered which...fine I guess, but I can see the ingredients and am not gonna order something I'm allergic to. 4. Our waters were never refilled even tho we finished them while eating the bread 5. Spaghetti was too salty and undercooked (yes I love al dente. It is undercooked if u can grind the grains while u are chewing). 6. We were obviously finished eating but we had to wave down the waiter to get our bill. 7. The waiter saw we had barely eaten our pastas so called the manager over. At this point we just wanted to leave, but told the manager about my pasta. It then took forever to actually get the bill delivered.  So we had both our pastas comp'd but it would have been much better to have a great experience and pay full price. This might sound nitpicky and honestly any one of these things individually wouldn't have been a big deal but when you add it all up, it actually really sucked. I think it's even worse cuz we have been to other Eatalys and pretty much always had a great time",
