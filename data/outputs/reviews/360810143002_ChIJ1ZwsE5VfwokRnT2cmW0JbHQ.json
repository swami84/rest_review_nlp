        "caption": "What a great experience! Astoria Seafood and Grill seemed underwhelming from the outside, but it is anything but underwhelming once you enter! The food was great, the service was fantastic! Our waiter, Javier, was attentive, warm and genuine. The seafood was fresh and perfectly prepared. The prices were extremely reasonable and the portions were generous. If you happen to find this hidden gem while in Astoria, do yourself a favor and stop in. You won\u2019t regret it. Absolutely delightful experience with great atmosphere, food, and service. I will definitely return!",

I had the grilled shrimp with a side Mediterranean salad-excellent with plenty to take home. The broiled scallops my husband ordered were delish, and again, huge portions. Our son had the fruits de mer with linguine. All excellent!  The restaurant is small and newly renovated, very nice. A great find!",
