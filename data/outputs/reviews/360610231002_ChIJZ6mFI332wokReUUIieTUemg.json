We shared Malai Kofta, Cabbage, and the Potato Cauliflower (Alu Gobi,) samosa, and naan. Also, Tikka masala vegetarian. The food was so good, I ordered from here on Seamless a few days later. Today, coming off of a juice cleanse, I ordered take out. I walked in and found the ghost of busy tables like most restaurants due to covid! A very peaceful space, open and welcoming! Beautiful art displayed on the walls. And lamps with pops of color adorn the ceiling! Couldn\u2019t help but think to myself how nice it would be to dine here under normal circumstances. Today,  I ordered their soup Dal! I\u2019m coming off of a cleanse. I ordered two because I\u2019m hungry never having their soup before I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect! As I waited I ordered the chai! The server behind the counter said it would take time but I could have it here now if I were in a rush! He pulled out the fresh spices, various from cinnamon to cardamon and some more I can\u2019t identify! After pouring in a glass he said take your time even after bringing my soup he said don\u2019t feel rushed and enjoy the tea! With everything so crazy something so simple made my day! I had great food here but the people who make it are also wonderful! Not to mention, the soup was amazing! Complete with a lemon slice! Hot and fragrant! I\u2019m Greek reminiscent of avgolemono  in taste but that flair of India! Highly recommend! Support small business!",

For those (like me) who enjoy alcoholic beverages with dinner, byob it's an option! They will pour your wine in a nice glass and have a wine key ready for you anytime. The service has been consistent and very attentive. The food is great but coukd use some of that consistency. Sometimes it comes out perfect and sometimes too sweet. Im not a big fan of sweet foods so I generally travel to Queens for Indian food. But overall I like this place alot. Welcome to the neighborhood and good luck, guys!",

I hope this place never leaves. It is such a godsend in this neighborhood.  I want to shout my love for this new restaurant from the rooftops: This is not only the best Indian food I've had in the neighborhood (by FAR); it may well be the best Indian food I've had in all of NYC (yes, including Jackson Heights and Murray/Curry Hill). This is going to be a regular restaurant for us. And they deliver, which is awesome. We ordered enough to have leftovers and even heated up in the microwave for lunch the next day, the food just completely rocked.  Edited to add: It's noteworthy that this restaurant currently (6/23/17) has way better reviews on Google than on Yelp. Why? Because Yelp is hiding almost all of their reviews as \"not recommended.\" I have no idea why. I personally wrote 2 of the reviews and they are absolutely legitimate. I have never had a review hidden by Yelp before. I can only imagine Yelp believes that a new business getting 5 star review after 5 star review must be shady. But I know my reviews are real and I know how amazing this place is so I imagine that the others are legit as well. I'm adding this here in case anyone is swayed by the lack of reviews (and one negative review) on Yelp - Don't be. The shadiness is on Yelp's part. This place is great and the people who work there are very nice (we went tonight, our second visit and the owner chatted with us for awhile) and I feel bad for them that Yelp is hiding all of their great reviews.",

        "caption": "There's finally a good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood!  They just opened today and I made sure to stop in. I ordered the lamb biriyani which was delicious!  A lot of half-ass Indian restaurants use crappy spices but these guys did it right with whole and freshly toasted spices that they grind themselves.  Service was good and the food came out pretty quick.  Definitely a great place and I look forward to checking out more of the menu in the coming weeks!  EDIT: I've gone back quite a few times since they opened. I've had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Rogan Josh, and Saag Gosht. As well as Lamb Biryani again, garlic and plain Naan and Kheer. Everything was consistently delicious. The second time I got the biryani it came out even better than the first time. They are very quick too, 10-15 minutes and pickup is ready.  So far my favorites are the Saag Gosht and the Lamb Biryani.",

Atmosphere: Beautiful, clean, and modern, with gorgeous accent pieces and wall art. Comfortable seating, and a reasonable volume.  Service: Attentive and friendly staff that takes great pride in the food and genuinely seem happy for you to be there.  Food: Oh my. Where to start! They give you a basket of papadum to start, with a delicious, freshly prepared version of the standard Indian condiments. We then shared the onion pakora (fritters) which was a generous appetizer size that is easily shared. It's a fried dish but was not greasy or soggy! For an entree I had the Vegetarian Tandoor, which came with a fantastic  assortment of paneer (my favorite), peppers, onions, potatoes, and mushrooms. They also have vegan options if you don't eat paneer. My boyfriend had one of their chicken entrees which was also amazing. We split an order of garlic naan, which was absolutely the freshest naan I'd ever had. We were totally stuffed, but shared an order of Gulab Jamon for dessert--this is a dish we fell in love with when in London (famous for good Indian food) and this iteration of the dessert did not disappoint.  One of the most amazing things was the price: all of this food, with generous portion sizes, came in under $40 (not including tip). The block is pretty dumpy but this place is an absolute winner. We will be back many times. I would absolutely recommend it!",
