I got the loaded tots with tiger sauce - which were also good in the moment, just a little greasy - however, that same night and the entire day after and counting I became so ill. I would certainly not go here again. They have a bar and everything so you would think it would be busy on a Saturday night - but it wasn't, AT ALL. There must be a reason! Overall I would not recommend the loaded tots at the least, but I get a feeling the tots aren't the only reason people aren't coming here...",

        "caption": "Just ate there yesterday. The bar staff (bartender/waitress) was not very friendly. It seemed like they were doing us a favor by serving us. No smiles, No greeting, and No kids' menus. The menu they do have though, makes your mouth water. So we ordered food to-go hoping it was better than the staff, but was a little disappointed. We ordered the Chicken Parm and their signature Pit Beef sandwiches, both avg at best. We specifically asked the Bartender whether the Jalapenos Bacon Mac&Cheese was pre-mixed with Jalapenos. His answer was NO, so we ordered a bacon Mac&Cheese with NO Jalapenos for my 2 year old. Opening it up in our hotel room, we realized that they gave us Jalapenos in the Mac&Cheese and No Bacon. REALLY!!!!?? We went back to return it to get a refund, but they could not even do that right!  There was no manager or authority on duty, so we weren't able to get a refund on the card right away. The bartender offered to replace the order, but since the original order took 25 minutes, we did not try to re-order anything.  The staff could care less! Their solution was \"come back tomorrow\". WHAT A JOKE!!",
