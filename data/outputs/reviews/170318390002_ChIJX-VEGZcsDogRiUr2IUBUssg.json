I liked the grilled eggplant ($10 for a small 3 slice dish), the wood roasted chicken ($14) and the crispy potatoes gratin ($10, not a real gratin). The spread with toasted pitta ($14), corn elotes ($10), margarita flatbread ($14) and the pickled heirloom beet salad ($12) weren't to my liking. We also ordered the little doughnuts ($10) and bread pudding ($10, not a real bread pudding) which were disappointing.  The service was slow at times, but nice and warm. In terms of Covid-19 the waiters wear gloves and masks. They do ask customers to wear their masks when they deliver/take plates to/off the table, but they don't always enforce it.  Last thing: I never appreciate a cancellation fee. They hold us to $125 in case we didn't show up (that was especially weird since we reserved the table an hour before and the restaurant was pretty empty). On top of that they added $2.5 PPE fee for each person (why should customers pay for that?).",

The restaurant was relatively empty but we had made reservations on Open Table just in case.  The service was great.  I told our waitress that I am gluten and dairy intolerant.  She immediately went back to the kitchen to have the chef help her mark out on the menu what items I could eat (or could be made GF).  I ordered the seared scallops and tamarind mussels.  My boyfriend ordered the burger, short rib and skirt steak which was way too much food.  The mussels were the best I've had! I loved the sweet and sour flavors....however the waitress told us that the chef was going to change up his recipe for the mussels in the near future! :(  All our dishes were amazing. I don't know why we haven't come here before.  Street parking can be tough depending on what time of day you go.",

The waiter said he\u2019d take a discount off our food. Remember that.  We had the cheesecake French toast which was dry with basically no cream cheese. The biscuits and gravy were good.  When the check came, there was no discount for the long wait. When I mentioned something, the waiter pretended he never said there\u2019d be a discount.

This place doesn't quite have an identity, though I think it's meant to be tapas, but in this case there's not enough on the menu and dishes aren't plated in a manner (or portions) for sharing. It's just lacking a little flair and flavor despite a tempting sounding small menu. All things said and done, it's a simple place with fresh ingredients with some reasonably priced dishes. The sandwich I had once for lunch had inedible pieces of chicken fat while part of my friend's order was never brought until we asked a second time. It's conveniently located near the Harrison L stop and has a comfortable atmosphere so long as the volume on the tv's are off. A large bar area with a full drink menu. Reasonably priced.",

Our thought would be falafels halved and served in place of reg burger patty. Expected the crispy exterior typical of a falafel. Instead I'd describe it as a chick pea patty cooked on skillet with a very mushy interior. Again, tasted ok but texture was not what we expected from the name.",

Martin and John (owners) had been catering events for me for almost 2 years when it came time to plan my rehearsal dinner for our wedding. In addition to being my caterer, my fianc\u00e9 (now husband) and I have eaten at their other restaurants and loved their food, so we knew we could rely on them for a delicious rehearsal dinner. As luck would have it, our wedding took place only about 4 blocks away from Sociale and we were able to host an amazing rehearsal dinner for our wedding party and out of town guests! Our journey to planning the rehearsal began with Martin graciously inviting us into the restaurant to do a tasting of different wines and menu items that would be a good fit for a passed hors d'oeuvres reception of 40-50 people. The food and wine were amazing! Having planned several events with Good Eats, and other caterers, a general concern of mine is how an item will be presented to guests and consumed. Martin had a plan for each item that was easy to take off the serving platter and be eaten without a tremendous amount of effort or mess, while still having 2-4 bites of each. They were incredibly accommodating and allowed us to pull items from their other restaurant menus (Sono Wood Fired Pizza & Burger Bar). We shared with Martin about how my grandfather was a great fisherman and smoked his own whitefish, so Martin created a crostini topped with a smoked whitefish spread that truly rivaled my grandfather\u2019s! For the actual dinner, Martin blocked out about half of the bar area for us, by their wine case, which allowed easy access for drinks for our guests and the food to come directly out of the kitchen at an appropriate temperature directly into our guests hands/mouths. Sociale set up a beautiful piece of polished wood for a cheese and charcuterie bar by the wine case. Our guests could not stop talking about how delicious all of the food was-- especially the smoked whitefish spread, the pork belly with kimchi, and the scallops with pistachio butter. Everyone equally loved the two desserts:  Brazilian bread pudding and chocolate panna cotta. Overall, it was such an amazing night that we decided to return to Sociale for brunch on the Sunday morning after our wedding!",

It just makes it difficult to select a satisfying, if at all memorable, course.

During happy hour, they feature their 4-5-6 menu, which is currently $4 smashed potatoes, $5 chistorras, and $6 pork belly. And for drinks they offer $4 draft beers (they always have four on rotation at a time), $5 red or white sangria, and $6 Sociale Cocktails (I prefer the spicy margarita).  For brunch, the portions are normal size and they even offer bottomless mimosas for something like $18. My favorite brunch dish is probably the duck hash skillet.  Unfortunately, I don't recommend coming here for dinner unless you're trying to impress a date. Sociale's dishes are focused around small plates, so the portions are a little small to be worth full price.  Definitely give this place a try.The staff are very friendly, the managers are caring and hands-on, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.",

My 6 year old daughter is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. We told the waiter of these allergens when we placed our order. The first item that arrived was a meat and cheese plate with toasted bread and no obvious nuts. My daughter ate half a slice of salami, a nibble of one piece of cheese and one piece of bread. Soon after she complained that she felt itchy and that her throat felt tight. A couple more items came out as well as our drinks but we told the waiter our daughter was having an allergic reaction and to cancel the remaining order. My husband paid $60 for a meal we didn't get to eat while I medicated my daughter then we went to the emergency room to manage her reaction. She received 2 more medications in the ER to stop the tightening in her throat. Then today I called Sociale to let them know there was definitely the presence of nuts in our food. The first manager I spoke to was apologetic and seemed to feel bad, but said another manager would call me later. The second manager called me, but I'm not sure why he chose to call. He didn't seem to care and told me that they already have a process in place to ensure cross contamination does not occur. Obviously, their process is flawed because my daughter had to go to the ER. In 6 years, my daughter has never had to go to an ER after eating at a restaurant-either restaurants accommodate her allergies or let us know they can't and we leave. Btw- our meal wasn't even comped.",

They could easily get tangled with people or other dogs in an incredibly high traffic area. I've seen dogs on their patio all the time. I live over here and see it regularly. Asked the server when we got there where dogs could sit and she said anywhere. This rude manager then came out and told me she has to sit on the sidewalk outside of the chain or we would have to leave. Never ever had a manager be that rude to me in the past. Too bad too because this could have been a regular neighborhood spot for me. Not now!! I will make sure I tell everyone to avoid going here because of their anti dog feelings and rude manager.",

There were 4 slices of scallop, equal to one and a half regular size scallop. Finally, we also ordered a roasted carrots for $8.95. The waiter told us before ordering there were carrots about 4\" long. When the dish came, we saw only four carrots, with only one that is about 3' big, the rest three were about 2\", one was half burned and the rest two pieces were completely burned. So basically, one 3\" carrot cost us $8.95.  It was unbelievable and not a pleasant experience.",
