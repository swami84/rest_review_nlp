I buy my detox, incense, sage, everything there! Initially from the outside looking in it could look a little intimidating. The neighborhood it\u2019s in, some of the ppl hanging out.

        "caption": "I have been coming here ever since I discovered them on Burke Avenue. I am not vegetarian nor vegan, but tend to visit a lot of these types of restaurants to try new dishes. This review is coming from someone who has tried Blossum, Gobo, VSpot, Candle 79, and many others. I also use to be a Health Inspector for the city, so I did a lot of traveling and tried different places during my lunch breaks. Hands down best vegan food in the city, or at least it's up there in my top two favorite vegetarian/vegan ever. Everyone I have taken here has enjoyed the food. If you've never experienced food made with absolute love, then you really have to try their food. All the dishes I have tried are well seasoned with fresh herbs in a wonderful mix of complex flavors. As far as operations, this establishment is a to-go type of eatery. You go in, order from their selection of the day, and then pay. The staff are really friendly, and are not the type to kiss your ass. However, if you have questions or want to learn more they are VERY knowledgable. Again, they are not there to kiss your ass, so get off your high horse or go somewhere else where they add a grain of salt to your food. They work really hard and are really kind, so they deserve the respect. Their main menu is typically what they make for the day. They offer cake slices (death by chocolate, cheesecake and some others), and plenty; varying teas, tonics, and herbs. There are some pretty good books too. I don't normally review but they are absolutely worth my time. I really love this place and hope they continue their good work spreading the love.",

I was in there for three minutes until I asked a question because none of the workers even cared to say welcome, or may I help you find something. I asked exactly what was in the \"chicken\", the lady yells, \"SOY\", then proceeds to use her phone. Not a soul in this place smiled or seemed interested in business. Not to mention in the back where they have the food, looked like it had been sitting there for hours. It was dried up from sitting under the heat lamps all day. One of my worst experiences I've had since moving to NY two years ago. Never will I even attempt to go there again.",
