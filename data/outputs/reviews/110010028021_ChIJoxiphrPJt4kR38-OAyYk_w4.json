Even though it was a Friday, I wanted to order something healthy and then perhaps something normal.  The Ceasar salad caught my eye as well as  the South Street cheese steak sandwich.  I found a nice table close to the front and by a window which was cool.  It didn't take very long for the people in the back to prepare everything, and by the time it was brought to my table it was hot and fresh.. This Ceasar salad was huge and there were several other vegetables included..  I would say it was probably enough salad in that bowl to feed two people.  The cheese steak sandwich came on an 8* sub roll that looked even bigger, .  It included a lot of steak that was sauteed in red onions that also had green peppers and delicious cheddar cheese.  I could only eat a couple of bites, and then I decided to take the rest back to work.",

Checked to make sure there wasn't a second order under the same name but apparently mine had just been misentered. Having already waited 30 minutes, I said I just wanted to make sure I had paid for what I actually received and left, having not yet noticed that they also got the topping wrong. Luckily, it was something I didn't mind eating and the pizza was fine for what it was but someone with dietary restrictions might not have been so lucky.",
