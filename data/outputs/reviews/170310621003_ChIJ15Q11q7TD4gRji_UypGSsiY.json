We ordered the Royal MIx Grill combo which I highly recommend their combination meals as they save you quite a bit of money and get a lot of food that'll leave you full and satisfied. The Lasssi drink was actually pretty good once i adapted to the interesting flavor. My only complaint was the fact we didn't get enough rice to go with all the food. Other than that definitely worth returning.",

I ordered that but when I got home even though it says it comes with Chicken Tikki, it doesn't come with the sauce. Mind you the sauces come in a 8.oz container. Well that sucks, I spent almost 30 bucks and didn't get what I wanted. I called and told her the situation. I asked if I could get an order of the Chicken Tikki Masala but at a discount. She knows that's what I originally wanted. No she said. i would have to pay 15 bucks for the 8 oz container.  Somehow treating myself for New Years was turning into a disaster. No thanks. I'm not spending 45 on lunch. So I spent almost 30 bucks on lunch and didn't get what I wanted. I totally regreted giving her a buck for carry out.

The masala needed to be more rich with flavor, I don't know but I had better one from my home country so to be fair this might be the local preference. Butter nan lacked enough butter coating. And strangely they added honey to the yogurt and cucumber order witch doesn't fly well together. Hmmm I think I will look for another restaurant. Well it's guest my opinion and you might have a better luck.",

We've been searching and searching for a local Indian restaurant that could live up to both the quality and affordability of what was lavished on us in Astoria and Jackson Heights, Queens, and throughout Manhattan.  Unfortunately, Lakeview didn't have a lot of options.  But as soon as we heard about Royal Indian Grill moving to a storefront only a short walk from our apartment, we had to put it to the test.  The restaurant passed with flying colors!  This is absolutely our new neighborhood Indian spot.  Not only that, it's without a doubt our favorite Indian restaurant in the city.  Their vegetarian entrees are out of this world.  Some of the best chana saag I've ever had (and I'm an expert), and since they don't mix cream into their saag it's quite healthy.  The kali daal was mind blowing.  Like a daal makhani but with a spicy kick.  The green chilis gave it a flavor unlike any daal I've ever had.  This place is definitely one of my all time favorite Indian joints.  Get a veggie samosa and you'll be in heaven.  Also, you won't break the bank.",
