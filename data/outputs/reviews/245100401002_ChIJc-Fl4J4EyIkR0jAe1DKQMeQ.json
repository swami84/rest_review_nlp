The only thing sweeter than the elegant macaroons and aesthetically pleasing dessert slices are the staff. You can get a lot of different kinds of pastries, and real buttery quiche, and even homemade chicken pot pies! The salmon baguette I tried was so delightful.. and they serve illy coffee..

I definitely recommend the almond croissant. Lots of little seating areas, including some nice outdoor seating. Note, you're supposed to leave your dirty plate, cups, etc. on the table when you're done; they'll bus the table after you're gone (this wasn't obvious to me when I was there). Prices are a little on the high side. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I generally find the wait staff to be a little too much on the quiet/unfriendly side for me. Nonetheless, I really like this spot and come here at least once a month. Would recommend for a cup of coffee when travelling solo and for a small, intimate meeting alike (2-3 people). Beyond that the tables aren't big enough to accommodate.",

For my husband\u2019s birthday today he specifically wanted to come here for a little bit to get a pastry and a coffee, and with our work schedules and traffic from another side of town we were happy we could make it in just before they closed. Their hours say they are open until 6 pm and we arrived at 5:40, after we stood in line we were told that their kitchen is closed, they only have a couple pastries left and their espresso machine has already been cleaned and they can no longer serve those beverages except for regular coffe. They put the pastries we got in a to go box, even though there was still time before they closed for us to be able to eat them there (5:52 to be specific) and at exactly 5:58 while we were sitting down (my husband was finishing the last bite of his pastry) we were told that they had to put up chairs because at 6 they are closing. When I asked about the espresso machine I was told that they start to clean it about 30 minutes before closing, so if you\u2019re looking to get anything besides regular coffee my suggestion is try another place.  If your business is half closed 30 minutes before the time you state,  you should change your hours for slower weekdays, just like many other businesses do, and if your customers are clearly finishing up you don\u2019t kick them out simply out of courtesy like pretty much any normal restaurant or cafe does.  Definitely very disappointed after this experience.",

I was waiting and saw they were serving other customers and doing other things around the cafe. After about 10 minutes of waiting I walked up to the counter and asked them if they were going to be giving me the pastry I had ordered. They said it would be out shortly. Another 10 minutes went by and yet I still hadn\u2019t recieved my pastry. At this point I was very upset. The pastry\u2019s are pre-made and don\u2019t have to do much to serve it. I was telling them that I was upset that they never gave me the pastry and they apologized many times and said they would refund me and give me the dessert free. In the end they gave me the dessert but at this point I was not going to eat it. This is the worst experience I have ever had at a cafe and it ruined my day completely. I do not recommend this cafe AT ALL. Terrible service and the food isn\u2019t the best.",

Might I suggest a perfectly flaky and buttery croissant or pain au chocolate (which has two bars of chocolate through it, as it should)? If you're in a sweeter mood the kouign amann is slightly over sugared but delightfully crunchy and caramelized all the way down, and the Parisian drinking chocolate makes for a spoil-yourself-break from their rich drip illy coffee. Whatever your order, just make sure you take a moment to stay and enjoy it. With an old world feel, fantastic ads from another era, and large shoppe windows to perch next to, this is a place to relax while the mad world continues outside without you.",

The tasting was a very fun experience, and the free coffee (which was surprisingly good) was the cherry on top of it all.  We called plenty of local places for cake tasting, but Cafe Poupon was the only one who was kind and patient, and subsequently the only place we actually went in for a tasting. Everywhere else that's noteworthy in Baltimore for wedding cakes was seemingly annoyed by our call, and acted inconvenienced by even answering the phone. I'd suggest to any friends or family to give Cafe Poupon a shot, they are awesome and great with their customers.",

I've had several lunches here; the bakery items are nice but the menu items are either sparse for the cost that they ask for OR the menu items are not fresh, such as the salads.  For example, today I ordered the chicken mango salad and I had about four small pieces of grilled chicken in the middle of a bunch of lettuce with small bits of avocado and tomato.  Another time, there was a bug inside the lettuce - clearly not washed well. This is in addition to the food taking quite a bit of time for a cafe, and while I was waiting none of the staff updated me on how long my food would take or even apologize for the 15 minute wait time (no one else was waiting).  They should stick with just being a bakery and not offer meals.",

The people working there were always very friendly and would offer explanations or recommendations when needed. There are quite a few dessert and food options, but almost all of them are small portions (by American standards) which I suppose is par for the course.  Despite the portion served, most everything I've tried has been flavorful and a delight to eat. My only criticism, and it's purely subjective, is there aren't many breakfast options that don't involve eggs and some kind of meat. To clarify, I mean this place appears to serve snack foods in that there aren't actual meals.  They have quiches, but they are small. Everything is all prepared and they don't actually serve to order. If you want a quiche or dessert they will heat it or just plate it, then serve it to you. It's probably a good business model but limited to the customers.  Also, the jug where you dispense water does so very slow into small glasses. If you're like me and drink a lot of water, then you'll end up going back to refill your glass several times and gets annoying.",

The decor was detailed and obviously created with love. The menu was not deluged with endless options. The customers were dapper and friendly. The only thing not very French was the impeccable customer service and kindly fellow patrons. They even served humane portions of food. And it was very tasty and my mocha was delicious! Even the bathrooms did their best to mimic old world European feel but with all the spoiled American modern features! If you\u2019re on Charles street and need some France in your life, head here.",
