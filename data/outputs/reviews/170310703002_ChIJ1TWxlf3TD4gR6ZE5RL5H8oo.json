(It stays fluffy on the second day for leftovers) Our order came with a complimentary egg roll which was a nice surprise. We ordered the orange chicken and the spicy mongolian chicken (not to spicy but a nice kick). The chicken was tender in both. I definitely recommend to anyone to try.",

They threw in an egg roll which was excellent because I will be ordering them in the future, crispy and super tasty! So happy to have a go-to Chinese place in the neighborhood",
