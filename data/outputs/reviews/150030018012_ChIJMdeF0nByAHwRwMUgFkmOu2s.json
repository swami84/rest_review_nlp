I'll order from them again on another non-rainy afternoon and enjoy the couple extra blocks stroll along the beach (I ordered here in the first place because the other locations closer to me were sold-out on something I wanted, and this location had it - glad I had a chance to give them a try).",

Busy in the am, not so much in afternoons as there are two more locations closer to the beach.  The prices are a little higher that other Starbucks due to Marriott Hotel location. Great seating available nearby in hotel. More of conversational or TV/reading seats, not a hipster-study zone.",
