The food selection is worth every penny! You get to choose between 3,4,6 courses! You can create your experience how ever you want. I wish I can give them more starts haha!! The Foie Gras!!

I had to cut her off and ask her if she was trying to tell me that I wasn\u2019t able to have the reservation? Even after explaining I was vaccinated, she told me that I could not have a reservation. I flew back to my home state to give vaccines and this is the first situation where I was penalized for helping.

However we waited almost 30 minutes past our reservation time to get seated and there were LONG periods between courses. The food was better than most places but for their STANDARDS it was bland and just so so. We're definitely going to give them a chance to redeem themselves in the future but for our 1st night out in months and a special occasion we were disappointed compared to our past experiences here.

We shared everything from the shrimp bisque, arugula salad, pan roasted sea scallop, white truffle fettuccine, grilled creekstone prime beef tenderloin, lobster tortellini, pan roasted Hudson Valley magret of duck and the grilled Colorado lamb rack chop. We loved the seafood and meats here. The lobster and duck were definitely our favorites. You can tell each dish has a particular highlight to it whether its the sauce, protein, or pasta. Rich, savory and French inspired definitely describe our meal. Just be mindful that this restaurant does not come cheap. Expect to spend anywhere between 150-200 per person. Charleston is a great spot to celebrate any special occasion. Great food with awesome service and an extensive menu to please anyone",

It was our first experience; as we never live in an area long. We were a party of four and subjugated ourselves to a drink in the bar while waiting for our reservation. We did not, personally, have an issue to wait, but the first responders acted, breathlessly, that we might not be okay. Eventually, we were told our table was ready. Our drinks would be taken to our table. We were allowed to have, in my opinion, the best table in Charleston. Charleston has an open kitchen; that is memorizing for those who admire the orchestra of a gorgeously run kitchen. The calmness. The beauty. No yelling or screaming; is it not one in the same? Our party of four ordered four courses each. Now, I will dissect. The Fresh Artichoke Soup is divine; truffle oil.  The Grilled Veal Sweetbread was soft and magical. The Pan Roasted Wild Halibut, took the breath away...the mushrooms; oysters. The Steak Tartare was luxurious. The Salad Gourmande is perhaps one of the best articles I have put in my mouth. There were missteps with the food. The Rich Lobster Soup with Curry; the pieces of lobster were overcooked. At the time, two people in my party had the Grilled Venison Tenderloin. While they were supposedly the same dishes, one of my party members said they received, little sweet potatoe puree, and too much sauce. Not consistent.  The service at Charleston is the best we have had in America. If you have a crumb on your plate, it is replaced. All dishes are explained when placed on the table. Your utensils are replaced. Your bread and water are always replenished. The personality of the staff, is what hospitality should consist of. The BEST.  Ms. Wolf, thank you for the food and experience.",

The food was hit or miss, and for the price we expected better quality and larger portions. We are accustomed to fine dining, but nevertheless we were disappointed. I spent the entire time feeling as though they were cutting corners to save money, which is not a feeling I enjoyed at what is supposed to be the best restaurant in Baltimore.  My husband got a salad which was essentially one leaf of a common varietal of romaine with some raspberries and a sprinkling of goat cheese. My asparagus salad had an interesting presentation, but there just simply wasn't enough goat cheese mousse to appreciate the contrast of flavors. His tuna tartare and my lobster soup were very good, and the portions were more appropriate. His scallop was perfectly done but uninspired (and there was literally one smallish scallop). The spring morel ravioli was lovely with a rich complex sauce. His rabbit loin and rice were very nice, but my tarbot was nothing I couldn't easily have done at home. Desserts were mediocre at best - dry flourless chocolate cake, and bland mousse. Even the complementary amuse bouches and petit fours were just okay. At the prices they command I expected better. We went for my birthday, and I doubt we'll be returning. I find myself wishing we'd gone somewhere else.  Finally, it is disappointing at a place as upscale as this that there isn't more emphasis on sustainability and responsible animal husbandry. Red snapper is known to be overfished, and veal is subject to cruelty. We make every effort to source ethical meats and seafood in our private kitchen - I would expect at least that level of effort from an award winning establishment.  I am revising my review down to one star because I was never contacted as was promised in their response below. They replied almost certainly as a public relations stunt, and not because they care two figs what I think about their restaurant. I've eaten a lot of excellent food in my lifetime so far, and I'm sorry to say it was not at this restaurant.",

I didn't really know what to expect as I saw the menu online and was somewhat thrown off by the option tasting menu situation. I was blown away. First of all, the portions are actually decent for a tasting type menu. You're not going to be absolutely stuffed but you aren't going to feel hungry after the light option. I have probably had better individual dishes elsewhere, but it would be hard to beat the consistency of this place. Each serving was better than the last. I thought the service was very appropriate. Seeing as the wine pairing comes with the dishes, hovering servers were not present nor needed. They were there when you needed them to be. I would imagine that were this restaurant in DC or NYC that it would no doubt be a 2 Michelin star. I also think that in terms of value for money, it doesn't get much better than this. Yes it's more expensive than your average restaurant, but it's really not that much more expensive and it is 10x better.",

It was disappointing that this is a restaurant that I like a lot but that it happened to me that left me wanting to return to its establishment implement security measures  on how to handle the food they prepare with all their workers including the waiters at least the practice of washing their hands every moment",

From the moment you enter, you will feel welcomed and well cared for without the overt pretentiousness that you might get at a place of equal caliber. We come here every so often, and are never dissatisfied. We most recently were here for our 30th anniversary, and once again were not disappointed. The young Sommelier was engaging and helped me understand what to expect, and the history of the wine I was drinking. The tag team of Jocelyn, Carmen and Nick seamlessly provided amazing service without being disruptive. The food is absolutely amazing, and the experience is so nice, it is almost embarrassing to take pictures of the courses. We stayed for over 3 hours, and could have stayed longer. Sit down, talk, and enjoy immaculate service, visually stunning courses, and amazing culinary prowess. I would argue that this restaurant is the best bang for your buck in town.",

We were greeted with \"Happy Anniversary \" from all the staff. There were so many staff members and every one was knowledgeable on every element of food and drink. One person showed us the cheese cart with a thorough description of each and a different person served it but could tell us every detail of each cheese.  The food portions are small for an average/big person. For me, a petite person, the 3 course meal was more than enough. The quality of the food was incredible. Unique flavors with every bite. Perfectly cooked meats.  The incredible part was the experience due to their attention to detail. My husband picked up the wine menu and a sommelier introduced himself and asked to give guidance on the selection. Another person served us complimentary desserts , like mini petit fours (cookies, macaron, Etc) and my husband took a mini half bite to save the other half for me. A server noticed and gave us a second complimentary serving!  Love the diversity of the staff, both in age and racially. The owners are clearly very thoughtful in how they select and train their staff.  We are making this our anniversary tradition now. Thank you Charleston!",

We specifically requested a quieter table, and we were not disappointed with where we were seated in the slightest.  The menu was full of delicious options.  There wasn't a single dish we regretted ordering.  I definitely recommend getting the wine pairing, if you enjoy wine. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines we were drinking, and was able to explain why they were paired with the dishes.    I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion.",

It was clear that the servers and others are not primarily interested in creating a perfect dining experience for the guests rather they are focused in selling as much as possible. They were extremely psychologically manipulative. In this they are subtle and nearly undetectable. I will share to what extent. In my case, I don\u2019t drink alcohol, in fact I dislike it so profoundly that I certainly would never in my life order it. It is well known that in the first couple minutes of arriving to a restaurant one is the most suggestible. The sommelier comes over. With an obvious focus on raising the price of the check not on guests well being, with nothing less than trained suggestion and outright undetectable to the guest psychological manipulation moments later the next thing I knew I\u2019ve agreed to a glass of wine. I would never have agreed to this otherwise. The server was cold and stoic. Not in a very elegant and proper manner that one might expect in perhaps an old world style fine dinning environment but rather plainly unanimated and low energy. I cannot say if he was fake in his attentions because he had a comprehensive command of his body language which revealed no negative tells but also no positive either. He certainly was not warm in demeanor. His delivery of descriptions of items on the menu and specials was not fluid and professional as one would expect in this price range of fine dinning. Rather several times he would pause and think for a while of the rest of the ingredients he was listing. His delivery was non fluid and even forgot an ingredient or two all together then had to refer to his paper in his pocket. When the sommelier would pour a wine glass then when asked about tasting notes would take a step back after saying something then another it gave the impression that he did not have sureness and confidence it what he was saying and took away credibility from his statements. When the others would come pour a wine glass then were asked about tasting notes could only come up with two words and often with noticeable difficulty and hesitation. The focus was truly on selling as much as possible and not on creating a perfect dinning experience. Another and I were both subconsciously psychologically manipulated to order 4 courses although ahead of time we both clearly had the intention and wish to order only 3, this is what would have occurred if our actual wishes took place. Most grievous of all I somehow ended up asking for a full wine pairing. I truly dislike alcohol and this led to deep despair that evening and probably years of regret. This would never have happened otherwise. There was an enormous amount of self serving, money generating amount of psychological manipulation. Some positives include good lighting, nice bathrooms, the food was good, great time spacing between courses, and very impressive food runners. The food runners were so genuine, composed, professional, and flawlessly delivered all descriptions without any hesitations. The restaurant would do fantastically if it would promote its food runners. Upon leaving, the smiles and general demeanor of the staff was so transparently disingenuous. Their actual self behind their facade was plainly visible. They were so extremely obvious that they are catering to us only because we are paying them to. Overall, the bill for our group of three was well over $600 after tip. The shocking level of coldness and fakeness combined with the horrible self serving money generating focus in place of aiming for perfect guest experience subtle psychological manipulation, unanimated low energy service from server, and unprofessional, flawed with broken speech, hesitation, forgetful delivery of ingredients and descriptions from server, and non fluid, hesitated, and strained delivery of tasting notes, and sommelier displaying visible signs of unsureness in his words, maybe could be explained if bill was 150. The negative aspects of service were truly rare and shocking.",

My water glass was never empty, utensils magically appeared when needed, and the staff was attentive but not overbearing. We lucked into a perfect table with a glass wall looking into the kitchen. It was so nice being close to the action and watching Cindy Wolf herself do business. I did the 5 course tasting with wine pairings, and everything was superb. I enjoyed the lobster and curry soup, shrimp ceviche, scallop #2, halibut and duck. I think my favorite was the halibut, but I already want to go back to try the other items on the menu. The wine pairings were absolutely perfect. The only course I didn't like was dessert...I had the pavlova and it was dry. Otherwise, such a perfect experience and I will be back to try a different set of items",

Everything was good, but the caramelized cauliflower on polenta with mushrooms (and oodles of butter) was other-wordly. One of the best dishes I've had anywhere.

We went to Charleston a year ago, for a very special day. The only thing that has stopped us from visiting again is the waiter who was handling our table. He gave us a very bad feeling about asking about questions about the menu. It was my first time at a fixe menu restaurant so he sort of made fun of it. Only the waiter was like this though, the rest of the staff were great specially the wine lady who explained a lot about the gini wine in their menu That wine has become one of our favorite wines since then. Overall great restaurant, great food and wine, but the service at least for my case could be a bit more welcoming!",

Wow is an understatement for how good of a dinner I had last night at Charleston. I decided to take a good friend out to dinner here for her 30th birthday, and called the day of for reservations. The staff member I spoke to on the phone made sure all of my questions were answered, and took the time to go over the menu/courses with me.  SERVICE: First off, free valet parking was extremely convenient. Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by the staff members and they wished my friend a happy birthday. Our waiter was extremely professional, and went above and beyond in describing each item on the menu. We spent approximately 2.5 hours in Charleston (be prepared spend a good amount of time here) and had prompt service the whole time we were there.  FOOD: We opted for the 3 course dinner with wine by the glass. I wish I could describe how good each meal was. Before our main courses, our waiter brought out the most delicious bread (one of which was the best cornbread I've ever had.) I started off with the lobster soup then chose truffle oil white fettuccini and then beef sirloin. Each dish was made with extreme detail and flavor. I especially loved that each time a dish was brought to her table, our waiter took the time to describe each dish and how it was prepared.  DESSERT: Man oh man the dessert was also spectacular. We were actually very full by the time we finished our third course but we couldn't resist ordering dessert considering dessert is INCLUDED with all course meals! (So don't skip dessert.) Our waiter recommended a chocolate dessert for me and each bite was to die for. Charleston also put a candle on my guest's dessert for her birthday which was thoughtful. They even brought out a separate tray of tiny dessert delicates as shown in the photo with this review.  All in all, I had the most phenomenal dining experience here. Definitely the most expensive dinner I've ever paid for but it was worth every penny. I plan on taking others here on special occasions in the near future. Thank you charleston for an out of this world dinner experience! I will never forget it.",

My husband and I celebrated our sixth anniversary here this past weekend,  and it is impossible to overstate how excellent our experience was.  We both selected 4 courses.  I should have taken more pictures of our meal, but we really wanted to savor with our senses and leave technology alone.  Each course was divine in its own way.  In hindsight I wish I wouldn\u2019t have selected as many rich items in a row, but I\u2019m not sure what course I was willing to give up for what was probably an exceptional salad.  I started with lobster soup, which was excellent, but was not the star of my meal.  Next was oysters Rockefeller that were cooked to perfection.  My favorite course was the crawfish and grits.  Interestingly this is not something I would usually order, but our waiter sold me on the shellfish\u2019s freshness.  It was delicate, fresh and glorious.  I finished with with a light preparation of rockfish, thankfully,  that perfectly rounded out the meal.  While I\u2019ve mostly highlighted the food,  the service was a big part of our experience. I\u2019ve never been treated better.  We had a special appetizer and dessert sent to the table in honor of our anniversary.  Service was attentive and smart without being pretentious.  Cindy Wolf and Tony Foreman were visible and present and more personally involved in the operation than I expected.  If you want a special dining experience in Baltimore,  look no further.",

Everything, from the atmosphere, to the knowledgable staff, to the gorgeously plated and delectable entrees, was top notch. (I daresay the best I've had in my life.) My husband cannot stop praising the quail and I was just floored by the scrumptuous venison course! It was his birthday, but I got to experience truly a wonderful dining expererience. The attention to detail was absolutely amazing. For example: one of the waiters surreptitiously caught my husband using his fingers to scoop up the last bits of a sauce and brought him a hot towel with lemon for his fingers between courses! Better still, it was a cold evening and the valet had my car at the front door warm and ready when we exited. What an amazing evening. 10/10 will return for our next special occasion.",

We can't afford to go regularly - we can have 3 outrageously expensive dinners elsewhere for the price of one meal at Charleston - but if someone asks \"what's the best restaurant in town?\" there is simply not another answer.  We've had several tremendous meals there, each time revealing something about an ingredient or a dish in a novel way that is really genius.  So many great little dishes and experiences.  The only oyster my wife has ever enjoyed.  The best mushrooms I have ever eaten. Simply incredible proteins.  Obviously Cindy Wolf knows what she is doing, given her array of great restaurants in town, but Charleston stands alone, as it enjoys her most focused attention.  It's an intimidating place given the price point and the almost hushed sense of silence and reverence you feel in the place - but our most memorable experience has more to do with NOT being gourmands than otherwise.  My wife sent back a bottle of wine that she really didn't enjoy, and the sommelier could not have been more gracious, offering up several other bottles that she also didn't enjoy.  Mind you, these were not corked, just not to her taste.  The somm was outstanding, generous and even offered to bring us wines by the glass that might be more to our (very uneducated) palates.  He proceeded to give a master class in wines; the piece de resistance was when he brought back the first (rejected) bottle (without letting us see the label), which had since had an opportunity to open up and was now properly paired with food and opened palates.  The once-rejected bottle was now a star.  Absolutely genius - probably the best experience I have ever had in a restaurant.   All done without arrogance or snootiness... just an absolutely sublime display of knowledge, graciousness, and customer service.",

The food was great! Normally I have a moderately sized appetite, and I came in STARVING, but the four course small plates, plus bread, and dessert left me extremely full. The staff was extremely kind and I never had an empty glass of water or wine. I had an amazing experience and would like to come back for a visit to try other menu items and cocktails. Thank you for a wonderful evening!",

I believe whether or not you find a particular dish or \"course\" exceptional or not depends on your personal taste. Two of the dishes that were highly recommended by our waiter fell short for me. One was panroasted rockfish with mushrooms, the other was shrimp and grits. For me, the rockfish was pleasant, but apparently, the waiter thought it was excellent and my husband loved it. The shrimp and grits was also unexceptional to me, I make better. Also, it consisted of one shrimp, butterflied and twisted to make a presentation, but one shrimp. The other dish that I found more than skimpy was the seviche. 4 paper thin slices of fish approximately 1/2\" x 3\".....ridiculous? yes.....but exceptional. I can still taste it and loved every minute bite. The sweetbreads with foie gras was also exceptional and memorable, and the lamb chop was delicious. The service was exemplary, subtle, never in your face, graceful and nothing was missed. But the true experience is the Sommelier. You would expect a restaurant that prides itself on its cellar to have an excellent sommelier. You would not be disappointed. But, to be excellent, a sommelier needs only to be deeply knowledgeable and professional, which she is. What she also is is warm, friendly, charming and beyond helpful. I learned more about wine chatting with Linah over the course of dinner than in any other time....ever. She clearly loves what she does and helps you to love it too. Without Linah, I would have been impressed with the quality of the service and presentation. With Linah, I had a delightful and memorable dining experience.",

Our waiter (sorry, no inflated titles from me) was insistent that we move our baby seat, which was tucked away under the table and in a corner of the restaurant. After, we failed to see the importance of removing what was essentially a non-obstacle, HRH Ms Wolf herself came to inform us that she was \"not at all comfortable\" with a baby seat positioned (sans baby) at the corner of our table. When I politely asked her what would be her solution to the issue, she replied: \"I don't know, I don't have children.\"  My niece and nephew made the trip from London to join me for my birthday - Charleston was NOT my choice from the beginning - food is a HUGE YAWN, but I regrettably relented. Thanks for serving utterly unremarkable food in a profoundly pretentious setting. This is thankfully the last time I will be dragged to this awful place. The solo star is the mandatory rating to even post this warning to the uninitiated. My true rating is -5.",

We were asked to sit in the bar area for a few minutes while waiting for our table, where we each had a glass of wine.  When our table was ready, the hostess / wine sommelier approached us by name, and showed us to our table, in the back right room.  Very quiet, only about 9 tables there.  We were guided through the menu by our waitress, and each chose the 3 course dinner.  Everything was fantastic.  Also opted for a cheese course, which was awesome as well.  Dessert was great too.  The chef, Cindy Wolf, made her rounds and talked with us as well.  Everyone was professional, friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend the shrimp and grits, and the passion fruit creme brulee for dessert.  Definitely not a restaurant we will frequent (due to the cost), but we want to return soon!  We will talk about this meal and experience for a long time.",
