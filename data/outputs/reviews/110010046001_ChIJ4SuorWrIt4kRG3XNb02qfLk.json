Also, the person taking my order over the phone was repeating my credit card number aloud when I was giving it to him. I had to stop in middle of reciting it and instruct him not to repeat it aloud.  I mean seriously, it\u2019s 2019, anyone standing around him could write my info down if I allowed him to continue and then make fraudulent purchases with my card info. Over all, this was the worst experience I have ever had in my life at any restaurant be it takeout, delivery, or dine in. Do not take a chance on this place unless you have absolutely no other options. A gas station sandwich would be a better choice than risking the waste of money and disappointment that La Villa will give you.",
