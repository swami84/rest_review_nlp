Don't be fool with pictures alone. The pansit tasted not only bad but it was undercooked,  the kare kare tasted left over fried pork with kare sauce,  the pork Adobo tasted old fried pork and smells bad, which surprisingly adobo should smell good bec of bay leaf and will taste good regardless of storing in ref for 2 or few days. The bistek tagalog was the only one we were able to eat just because we were too hungry already. FRUSTRATED.",

Well I ordered 4 halo halo in which all had vanilla ice cream for almost $8 a cup I would think that it would at least come like a traditional halo halo but it didn\u2019t. I never tasted it with vanilla ice cream with it but tried it, which the ice cream tasted freezer burnt and when I verified the menu it did say vanilla and an up charge for the ube flavor, I thought it was strange to be charge for more when first of all the halo halo did not taste as good as it was priced.",

Apparently it was done and been sitting on the counter so we told them to pack it to go. And they still took forever to pack it. It was over an hour wait overall. Terrible customer service.

It kinda felt like we\u2019re begging for food.  Today, we decided to just drive over there for a pick up and call in advance so that it will save us time waiting for our order. After getting my order, the lady told me it\u2019ll take 45 minutes. When we usually dine in there, it takes way less time than that. So I asked her courteously, if they can please start making the order now since I am just 15 minutes away from their place. Then all of sudden said \u201coh I\u2019m sorry but we are not accepting advanced order anymore\u201d. I got confused and just decided to go there and place my order once I got there, as opposed to saving 15 minutes. Thank you Kawayan for being so accomodating.",
