And we were hungry. I did see that sandwiches were $12, but should have paid better attention to drink prices. 2 sandwiches, 2 bottles of water, and a bottle of juice came out to be $48. I did not see the water dispenser at the very end of the counter that we could have used instead. Nor did I realize how big the sandwiches would be. So, kudos on the size, but we could've saved the money, split a sandwich, and used the free water. But that's on us, not the place. The price is what hit me. Wasn't expecting to pay a whopping $50 on a meal in a cafe. 3 stars because the natural light in here is very pleasant and the sandwich was actually pretty good, though it had lettuce and tomato on it, which was not stated on the menu. Wasn't expecting it, but I guess they all come with L&T? Oh well. I picked it off.",

I wanted so much to like this place - I previously had an amazing chicken salad sandwich here - but my recent Saturday morning experience completely ruined it for me. Please please do something about your supply chain operations for this cafe - fruit for your smoothies should be fresh, not frozen rock solid, and high quality. I can get an amazing high-quality smoothie at my corner juicer in Cobble Hill - why can't I get it from one of the nicest hotels in the Brooklyn area? Hopefully the whole experience improves and the service and quality of food become just as high-quality as the design of the hotel.",

No sides, not an overstuffed sandwich, just a few slices of ham and cheese on a baguette with some mustard.  Come on now.   The coffee was good and the service was friendly and fast, which is the only reason this place get 2 stars.",
