They ended up having extra tables open so we got to stay longer than 1 hr. We felt like VIP (next to dj). I tried greek food at athena and wasn't impressed (too earthy). I had a 4 course meal here and everything was DELICIOUS!! the frappe martini is amazing too and all affordable. 5 stars all around. Thank you so much!",

FYI - covid is still a thing & there is no social distancing here. Every table was filled on the first floor + at the bar. We sat upstairs and every table was filled. Plus the tables were so close to each other that on several occasions people walking passed bumped into our table, our dishes & us. It was hot and there wasn\u2019t much ventilation in there.

The occupied tables were plenty distant from each other, and the servers and staff were well masked, but still friendly and helpful. It was our first time in a restaurant since July, and Avli didn't disappoint us. As someone who lives back and forth between Greece and Chicago, I'm pretty picky about Greek food - we were really impressed with several small plates (mezes) including the saganaki (which isn't something we would order, but the figs intrigued us and we were so glad we chose it), and the kataifi shrimp was perfect. We were happy to enjoy a plate of zucchini chips with skordalia (garlic sauce) - the best we've experienced outside of Greece (actually, the chips were the best we've eaten anywhere!) All in all, a safe happy space for a long overdue lunch out.",

The minute my group and I walked inside, I felt like I was transported back to pre-COVID times (with the exception of masks that were not even worn properly by the staff).  I understand that indoor dining in Chicago just opened up, but it was very clear that Avli's ownership had no regard to the city's rules and regulations.  The place was PACKED.  We asked to sit outside on their heated patio but was told that the wait would be very long.  Since we had already been waiting over 45 minutes for our 7:30 reservation, my group and I decided to settle on the next available table  -- which was wedged between two other packed tables and was an arms-reach by the (mask-less) DJ.  The bar was packed.  The first floor was packed.  The staff (bartenders and servers alike) would take off their masks to speak to one another and then put them back on once they were done.  The man who I presume was the Chef and/or owner of the restaurant walked through the restaurant greeting guests -- completely mask-less.  And on top of all the blatant disregard for the health of their customers - and one another, for that matter - it took awhile for our server to ask for our drinks/food, it took awhile for our drinks and food to get to our table and it then felt like the busboys were trying to get us out of there ASAP to make room for the next party.  I was extremely disappointed in this restaurant.  There is a way to operate a restaurant safely during COVID times and this was not it.",

I guess I got lucky and this was my first (but not last) visit to this charming taverna.  The atmosphere here at Avli is low key, inviting, friendly and completely breathtaking.  The interior of the restaurant is well organized, brightly lit and designed beautifully.  The outside dining was just as lovely cozy and inviting with the heating furnaces to keep everyone warm and toasty.  I ordered an artisinal lamb meat burger with their homemade feta cheese spread and Greek fries with crumbled feta cheese.  The burger was generously sized and the gourmet spread goes extremely well with both the burger and fries.  As you are seated your server will bring you your own pitcher of water and two slices of homemade bread with Greek olives.  I thought everything tasted so fresh and full of lively flavors to tease your palette. It's obvious to me that the food is prepared with love so kudos to the chef for authentic Greek cuisine.  The waitstaff here is super friendly, efficient and attentive to your needs and even the manager came directly to my table to make sure I was okay.  The outside set up is so beautiful and honestly the warming heaters were so hot I was able to dine outside without needing to wear my coat.  I know dining outside might seem daunting in our colder winter season; but I truly felt comfortable here because the space heaters did their job!  There was so much food I even brought a large portion for my canine and I to share this afternoon and she also gave Avli 5 \ud83d\udc3e paws up. I'm thanking the entire staff for providing me with such excellent food and service \ud83d\ude4c",

I've been to your River North location numerous times. I usually come on Mondays. Good food, good service and a wonderful host.  My problem has to do with the host on weekends and his unacceptable behavior. An angry middle-aged grey-haired host with no manners! I've been two times on a Saturday night and both times I've experienced the same thing. The way he approaches the tables and speaks to customers is unacceptable! Both times I've been seated on Wells St. I like it because it's more quiet and reminds me of a platia(town centre). The first time the host was yelling to our waitress and the second time to the customers. The last time there were three women sitting at a table beside us. The host told them in a loud tone of voice to finish their wines because he needed the table. Not even five minutes later he came back in a very angry mood and told the ladies that they needed to go even though they hadn't finished their wine and he stood there until they left. He even called a busser to clean their table and place new mats even though the table was occupied. The people from the surrounding tables were in shock. On his way back to his host stand he pointed at our table and literally screamed to the waitress \"dioxtous\"(kick them out). The young lady looked scared. What business in the world accepts and applauds such a behavior.  I have sent Avli 5 emails so far and they totally ignored me. The reason I'm posting this here is because I want to see if they will ignore my review. This past Saturday, my daughter and her friends were at Avli and they had a similar experience. The same guy told them that they needed to finish with their drinks and go. When my daughter told him that they've already ordered more drinks and needed more time, he looked upset and told her that he doesn't care and he wants the table. Who is this guy? Is he more than a host? Is he a part owner? On their website they're talking about philoxenia (an act of hospitableness and welcome). I'm sorry but this is not Philoxenia! This is bad customer service, unprofessionalism and disrespect!",

Once we were assigned a waiter things improved a lot - the service was much better and food was great, but the initial experience of having to wait and be seated was a pain.  I'd still recommend going because the food really was excellent. Very authentic Greek food, great quality and presentation. Solid drinking options also.",

This first time around we tackled the spreads, and small plates section. The Spread sampler, Beet salad, Greek meatballs, Calamari, and Village salad- to name a few. Dishes were fantastic in both taste and presentation, and ingredients were fresh. A gem in River North! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!",

Made a stop @ the lakeview location as well.  An excellent decision, on my part.  I\u2019ve been waiting for a good Greek restaurant to open up in my neck of the woods (river north).  I find a lot of places especially in Greektown have been subpar!! Not to throw anyone under the bus. But as my palette has graduated from many frequent Greek establishments, that I frequently visit.  I can honestly say this is a go-to.  Some kinks to work out, but it\u2019s understandable as there operations are new!! My experience thus far, has been extraordinary!! From my first drink @ the bar, from our bartender nick, answering questions regarding the menu.  I often do not write reviews, but this place has made a lasting impression on me!! I hope this place  stays as a neighbored staple!! Avli (river north) you ROCK!!",
