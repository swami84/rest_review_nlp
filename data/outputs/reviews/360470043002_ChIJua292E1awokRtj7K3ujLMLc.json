The drinks we ordered, two cans of Ginger Ale, weren\u2019t cold.  In addition, the requested sides for each individual dinner weren\u2019t placed with each order.  One dinner was supposed to have potato salad and collards.  The other was supposed to have the macaroni and chess with the corn. They mixed up everything! We will not go back to this restaurant!",

I ordered four meals and some drinks which totaled to over $70 with drinks. I requested all white meat  which is an option on door dash. Upon receiving my order I did not have any white meat in any of my meals. I immediately called the restaurant to explain what happened. I was greeted with a person who claimed they couldn\u2019t find my order at first and then abruptly said \u201cwe don\u2019t have that option do you want a refund\u201d With an attitude . There was no apology there was absolutely no customer service and to be honest this is the type of professionalism that is needed for any business to survive  in a global pandemic. Businesses are suffering everywhere and for me to want to support a small black owned business during a pandemic and receive this type of treatment it is very disheartening. I am beyond disappointed  with the customer service I don\u2019t even want to eat my food. If I do decide to eat the food that came very cold I will put another review at a later date. I hope the owner is able to read this message and take note that  customer service is key in these times right now you will not survive !  your business will be negativity impacted and completely destroyed if your customer service is not up to par, good food is one thing but customer service keeps your doors open.",

I've always passed Soul Spot, and never tried it, so I looked at the menu online and they had it all: I ordered fried whiting and fried shrimp, mac n cheese, rice and peas, a side of greens, and it came with a nice piece of corn bread to top off my meal. I'm a pescatarian and I do not eat beef, chicken, or pork. I called ahead to ask about food preparation and I was very pleased to hear that their collard greens and string beans (traditionally cooked with bits of ham) are made WITHOUT pork. Soul Spot is halal! Everything was so good.... so good, in fact, that I had to call back and personally THANK THEM for such a wonderful meal. I think there is a little something for everyone here - delicious food made with care, amazing portions for the price you pay, and nice flavor that vibes with the downtown Brooklyn scene. From the outside it looks kind of small, but don't let appearances deceive you. This is a place to be reckoned with! Thank you Soul Spot, and I look forward to dining with you again soon!",

They were talking amongst themselves and I had to wait to order. I wasn't able to fully see what they had let alone get some information from the girl behind counter, I felt rushed. The fried chicken was ok, not greasy but not so flavorful either. The collard greens and mac&cheese were a bit spicy but ok. I also ordered jerk chicken with mash and corn for my son let's see how that goes.... I doubt I'll be back. Btw I also ordered the banana pudding as I was told they just made it,  eh not spectacular.",

Wow .....very unwelcoming Very disorganized with smaller portions  What happened to the previous Ladies? They were awesome! I returned because the service as well as the food was worth while But this visit Not only the staff changed but had no sense of proper food service and definitely no ppl skills and like I mentioned before portions are smaller To the Spanish girl there with her 3in. long nails serving the food THAT size nails ARE unsanitary!!! And if u are afraid to brake one while u are serving or preparing take out orders maybe u shouldnt work there PS your attitude needs improvement.  Lastly the previous staff would bring the food to the table, ask  the customers if they needed anything else , and \"how was your food \"?

Anyone who knows fish, especially someone from the South as I am, knows that this fish should be tender, moist and flakey. Not only was my fish not fresh;  it appears that it had been re-cooked,  so that it was tougher than an old pair of shoes.   It's particularly upsetting because before I even ordered, I specifically asked if my fish would be cooked fresh to order and was told it would. The collard greens were at least edible, if a bit too salty for my liking; the mac & cheese mediocre. I decided to try the Soul Spot based on the reviews. Maybe I'm a purist and maybe the Caribbean food tastes better,  but my experience was terrible!",

I've never had an issue with having that request fulfilled until today.  Not only was I put on hold for 7 minutes after the request, I had to hang up and call back to verify that it could be done.  She told me that she had other customers to service and if I could just wait some more, instead of just confirming whether or not people's names can be written on their respective orders.  After some unnecessary back and forth, she said it could be done.  Two hours have come and gone and still no food order has been delivered.  I called the delivery guy and he told me that the vendor was complaining about how much food was ordered.  I guess I will take my $200 dollars worth of purchases elsewhere.  Will never order from them again.",

The space is small but I was able to sit and eat because it was not crowded for lunch. You can place your order online before you arrive so it will be ready once you get here. They also deliver.  I see a lot of other reviews say they only take cash but I paid with my debit card and had no issues. I ordered the lunch special of oxtail with two sides: mac n cheese and cabbage. the oxtail was tender and flavorful. So were the sides. The meal is $13.99 plus tax. So roughly $15. The staff was friendly and kind.",

The store called me back and promised that he would return. He actually came the second time but then demanded that I give him a tip - and nearly refused to hand me the food! Why on earth would I tip someone for (a) being uncivil and dishonest and (b) not doing their job?  After an hour-and-a-half, the food was very cold, although I'm sure it would have been great fresh. I was excited to find a restaurant of this sort with vegetarian options and even offering Italian food.  But, think twice about eating at a place that hires this kind of help. It says much about the quality of the establishment.",

She was very rude and bothered by us when we asked questions but I decided to order my food despite her bad attitude. The food was alright. The second time I came, I came with my boyfriend so we could try their Mac n cheese. When we got there was asked for a price on the small and large. A girl behind the counter told us the small was $3 and some change. Another woman comes from the back and tells her it's now $5. Then they start giggling and talking. Is overcharging customers funny or lying about it? Because on the menu it says it's $3.99. Needless to say, we took our money and left. There is no reason to spend money on subpar food and horrible service. Go elsewhere.",

The lemon they used must have been rotten because I don't understand how a person screw up on freshly squeeze lemonade. The collard greens and mac and cheese were GREAT compared to everything else probably because it was canned and boxed. Maybe this restaurant should stick to frozen and canned food because their fresh items are a waste of recipes.",
