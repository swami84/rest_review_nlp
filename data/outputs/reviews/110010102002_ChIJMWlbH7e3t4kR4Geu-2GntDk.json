The Havana was delicious, featuring their plantain chips, croquet's and empanadas. The only thing we would have traded out were the brownie bites, possibly for something to match the rest of the dish's savory flavors. Their Cuban sandwich was amazing, featuring some great roast pork and well done sauces on toasty bread. We also enjoyed their frozen Pina Colada drinks, we were nice on a hot day. They followed good social distancing rules. as you order inside with a mask, and they bring out the food to each table with masks. We will definitely be back.",

The drinks were brought to us and were quite strong,  so we asked if they can give us lighter drinks. They sent us a few drops of pineapple juice to lighten the strong taste rather then make new ones or allow us to order something else. Our food never came to us after we watched numerous people receive their take out orders when we were sitting there expecting to have our food brought to us after the drinks.  After complaining were told that an error was made and our food was sitting in a bag up front. They added a few extra empanadas to compensate for the inconvenience . We ordered 3 chicken and 3 beef but what we got was 1 chicken and 5 beef.  I was told that fresh food was made but unfortunately, they were all cold and to make matters worst weren\u2019t tasteful at all. In our disappointment with the food the service and over all place we left the food there and walked out. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE . There are so many other great places to dine out at the water front.",

I would give my wife's meal a 5 out of 10. I ordered a sandwich Cubano (Cuban Sandwich) and a Cuban coffee. My Cuban sandwich was quite bland for a Cuban sandwich, which by the way was recommended to me. The only thing that gave my sandwich flavor was the mustard that was covering the pork, because the pork tasted like it was boiled and slapped onto a bun with sauce. To be considered a Cuban restaurant the only thing that had REAL Cuban taste were the coffee and empanadas. The empanadas I had were chicken, beef, spinach, and corn with 2 types of cheese. I would give their empanadas a 9 out of 10. The coffee was very delicious and was very close to how Cuban coffees are supposed to be made. As a Latin American who has traveled and very familiar with Cuban delicacies and restaurants I was unhappy with the quite bland tastes they served at this establishment. Would I recommend this establishment to someone who wants to try Cuban food? NO. I would rather recommend visiting a place that cooks ethnic food the way it's SUPPOSED to taste so that way when you order a meal you get the right flavors touching your pallets and are impressed with the delicious flavors of Latin America.",

Here's what was a plus:  1) It's a beautiful space with outside murals by a Dominican artist and the inside tiles. It's a space that screams summer and vacation. You feel like you're in Havana.  2) The food was good. I ordered the guava pastry and it was large and tasty.  Here are the downsides:  1) The staff isn't friendly at all. The manager was not warm and when asked a valid question, she acted annoyed. I'd like to think it was just a bad day (which we all get), but I am curious if others experienced the staff in this way as well.  2) There was a lack of organization. People didn't know how to order, where to stand, etc.  There's outdoor seating where you can social distance, but I won't be running back to visit.",
