Our server Melissa told us about the different dishes, refolded our napkins whenever one of us left the table, and has a lovely demeanor the whole evening. The first thing we tried was the house bread and butter. The loaf was freshly made and had a decadent soft outer crust and an airy interior. I strongly recommend the bread. Next up I had the potato soup. The dish preparation wowed me. The unique flavor the dish has caught me off guard and I grew accustomed to it. I ordered the 60 day dry aged bison cooked medium rare. Once again the team put a wonderful effort into presentation of the dish. The meat laid out and horseradish and celeriac drew the eye to the wonderful juicy bison. All of this drizzled in two sauces. The main course left me underwhelmed compared to the openers. The taste of the bison didn't strike me the way the bread did and the celeriac had a mouth feel that put me off. I ordered a peanut butter creme brulee for dessert. Once again the presentation hit it out of the park. The taste matches for dessert. It was like eating a peanut butter and jelly with a spoon. My overall impression was good, and the price range being what it is makes it hard to know how often I will return.",

We were sat quickly on arrival, which was excellent. Unfortunately it then took about 10 or 15 minutes for our waiter to take our drink orders. I don't think he had more than 2 tables, so I don't know what the holdup was. He kept my drink filled, but was slow to bring the bill as well... not bad service, but not exceptional. On par with any midlevel restaurant.  I ordered a salad and the striploin. My friend ordered the bone-in 100 day dry aged tomahawk chop which they brought out and explained while also asking that we allow time for it to be cooked... this was a nice touch, and he appreciated the fanfare, after all, it cost $250!  The salad was pretty basic, just some iceberg lettuce with a few squirts of dressing and some tomatoes and pickled onions on top. It was good, but I felt it wasn't anything I couldn't get elsewhere for a lot less. For example, Lazlos has a side salad that blows this one out of the water and costs a lot less.  The striploin came and I was excited. I enjoyed the flavor very much as it was dry aged nicely and cooked perfectly, but it was literally about 4 bites of steak. I guess I expected more for $58... and the sides? They were, as far as I could tell, about 5 pieces of celeriac that had been tossed on a grill for a short time, so it was charred a bit and (I'm not joking) 3 or 4 boiled (or steamed?) celery sticks... like the kind you get with hot wings. I got very little flavor out of these, and wouldn't have eaten them, but I was still quite hungry given the size of the rest of the meal.  I don't know... I hate giving bad reviews, but for a bill over $100 for one person (I had a few beers too) I was expecting a LOT more. 801 Chophouse in the area (where we went last year) was a LOT better, and cost about the same.",

We liked the location (get a drink beforehand at the \u201csecret\u201d bar next door, the Wicked Rabbit), the server was friendly, and the food was good.  However, for the price we paid (nearly $300 with the 20% tip) we sadly were not wowed, and we really wanted to be!  We are foodies and love doing wine and food tasting menus. When we do those types of meals, we are accustomed to an explanation of what we are eating and drinking and the occasional visit from the chef.  Unfortunately, our server\u2019s idea of explaining the food went something like, \u201cNow this wine is from Spain....I can go check on the name....but anyways, wines from Spain are like my fav because they\u2019re good and they\u2019re cheap!\u201d  And, \u201cSo do you guys get the what\u2019s going on here? This is like a New York strip and some carrots my chef found at the market today. Enjoy!\u201d (Then she\u2019d scaddatle like a kid in a candy store lol!).  I mean, we don\u2019t need a dissertation but a few more details when you\u2019re paying $75 (food) and $35 (wine) per person should be a given.  The food was good, it just wasn\u2019t quite up to  par with the other tastings we\u2019ve done in Omaha and Kansas City. We are unsure if we will go back. If we do, we will avoid the chefs wine and food 5 course tasting.",

Our food was perfectly executed, I highly recommend the Waygu Benedict. However, I was not impressed by our waiter and service has a way of making or breaking an experience. I asked about specials I had seen posted by the restaurant and received a very short \u201cwe only have what you see on the menu\u201d response. I ordered the bottomless mimosa and shouldn\u2019t have since getting a refill was impossible. It felt as though we were an inconvenience to our waiter and he would rather be anywhere else. The rest of the staff that we interacted with were all lovely. The decor and the ambiance of Monarch is fabulous. I will visit again and hope for a better service experience.",

It looks nothing like the pictures on their website.The food is very overpriced and you get very little for what you pay for. Also, interpreting the menu is very difficult, they word the dishes vaguely and you really dont know what you're ordering until it comes out. I really wanted to like the place but it makes it difficult when the wait staff doesnt even like it. We wanted to order a steak but didnt want to wait half an hour like it states on the menu. We were so disappointed that after two drinks (one beer and glass of wine), one appetizer, and $50 later we decided to just go somewhere else.",

I was confused walking in at first because there's a hotel entrance, then you walk through a sitting area, and then you get to the hostess stand. I really liked the decor with the huge walk murals and interesting colors.  My friend and I both knew walking in that we wanted the chef tasting menu. I asked what it included but the waitress said it was a surprise and asked if we had any food allergies just incase. We said we didn't so we went ahead with that.  I really enjoyed the courses but I was a little surprised how small each plate was. Chef tasting menus at other restaurants I've been to have all been more substantial. Another concern was how long we were waiting between some of the courses.  For these two reasons I didn't think it would be right to give 5 stars.  Overall though we thought it was a good experience. The wait staff was great and we really enjoyed the food.",

The hostess area was actually around a corner so we hung out awkwardly until a server and not the hostess asked us what we needed. \u00a0We were quickly seated at after we actually found the hostess. Our table was dark. I'm talking cannot read my menu dark or see the face of my husband dark. I'm sure it was part of the mood, but if I have to use the table candle to read the menu perhaps your definition of mood is off. \u00a0More disappointment was to follow. One of the reasons I actually choose the location was because of the 5 course tasting menu. It turns out that there was a special tasting menu as it was Christmas eve which would have been great, but actually only consisted of 4 courses and one was an amuse bouche and another was a dessert. \u00a0It would have been nice for the website to have let us know this beforehand as 4 courses is hardly a \"tasting\" menu. We decided to order from the regular menu. We each ordered a first, a main course and a cocktail. We also ordered a side and bread and butter. Nothing ticks me off more than having to pay for bread and butter at a nice restaurant. \u00a0I feel that is one of the things that should be included. So our cocktails arrive and they are pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong, they were strong, but mine tastes just like tequila and nothing else and my husbands was basically a margarita. Our first courses arrived and they are nothing special, and if being honest a little bland. The bread and butter we had to pay for was served right in the middle of our first course Which made it very hard to really enjoy it warm as we were currently eating something else. \u00a0My main course was scallops and this was the most expensively disappointing serving of food I've had in some time. Two of my three scallops had not been cleaned properly and had consider amounts of grit. They were cooked correctly but paired with steamed squash. The dish lacked seasoning and flavor and tasted like baby food. The plating was nice, but it was hard to fully appreciate it as it was so dark I couldn't really tell the color of the food I was eating. My husband's bolognese was just mush. He said he couldn't discern the gnocchi from the sauce most bites and that it was rather unappealing to look at. \u00a0Our service was prompt but rather unprofessional and didn't seem overly versed in the actual food. She had to look up simple questions like what was on the tasting menu. My husband complimented her tattoos which prompted a bit to much information about playing a game with her mom about all the locations of her numerous tattoos. At the end of the meal we were so disappointed me left without even looking at the dessert menu. We just wanted to pay the over 300 dollar bill and go. I think my husband's statement as we got back into our car was fitting. We had lunch as a taco shop that day and the food was flavorful, the service impeccable, and the price tag was 9 dollars. \u00a0He said that the meal at Monarch was the second most satisfying meal of the day.",

I mentioned this to both the front desk and in passing to Janelle, a manager of the Monarch. We were informed that neither of these details are accurate. HOWEVER, everyone, especially Janelle, corrected the errors with such grace and generosity! Our meal was divine! The staff was so knowledgeable, receptive and attentive. The atmosphere was great. But really, the star of the show was Janelle. She was amazing. Thanks to her, we had an incredible anniversary experience that we won't soon forget. Yum!",

The restaurant was far less busy and the wait staff was much friendlier and accomodating.  We will definitely go back again.  On 25 Aug 18, we were guests at the hotel and made reservations for dinner. It had been a couple months since we had dined here and they modified their menu. Waited 40 minutes for a waiter to take our order and when I ordered the lamb I was told they were out. I then asked if they had gotten rid of the monarch burger since it was not on the menu anymore and was told it was on the lounge menu now and that I could not get it in dining room. Waiter had an obvious negative attitude. Staff made us move after already waiting from the dining room to the lounge (50 feet away) and the waitress there ignored us for another 40 minutes before we left. Almost an hour and a half and no service/food plus all the other restaurants close by were now fully booked. Absolutely terrible service ruined our night in the hotel and plans for a birthday dinner.",

I get the little sister of the steak and it was mediocre. I order a glass of Bordeaux to come out with the steak - not only does it not arrive until 10minutes after the steak but they are also out of Bordeaux and give me something totally different. I had to eat my cold steak with a glass of wine which didn\u2019t even make sense for the pairing. This place claims elegance and sophistication and even has the price point to match those claims - it ended up being totally false.",

This restaurant is at the bottom of Hotel Deco where I was staying. I had worked up quite a bit of an appetite after a long day of walking the Old Market and on to the Joslyn Art Museum. My friends weren\u2019t arriving into Omaha from California until later tonite so I thought I\u2019d treat myself to a really nice dinner.  Luckily I got there fairly early and was ushered to a nice seat by the window. The restaurant is 2 levels,  one goes down to a cozy space with a darker atmosphere. I chose to stay at street level where there was more light and I could look out the windows.  I started with a beet salad which was dressed with a light and amazing dressing bad accompanied by ramps and egg yolks. Truly amazing.  Then I had the 21 day aged Wagyu sirloin (medium rare of course!!!). and asparagus with lime and creme fraiche. Totally superb.  Tender yet hearty. Sometimes I feel like having something a bit more robust than filet mignon or prime rib.  The asparagus was just perfect.  They had a snap to them and a lush buttery flavor that were perfect side by side with the steak.  My server - Josh? - OMG I was so taken with everything he suggested and now I\u2019m spacing on his name). Anyway he suggested a full bodied Bordeaux To go with everything.  And he was right!!!  Perfect pairing!  And to top it all off I got the s\u2019mores dessert.  They look like petit fours covered in luscious dark chocolate with crumbled graham crackers on the bottom and candied hazelnuts that had stretched sugar stems that were edible. They almost looked like mini lollipops. And surrounded by whipped marshmallow that was given some browning to remind you of real s\u2019mores getting crisp over an open flame.  Overall,  best total meal I\u2019ve had in a long time!",

He is quite knowledgable about every aspect of the operation, which is incredibly comforting and helpful to patrons.
