Aside from the lame excuse they had 40 minutes to call to let me know and save me the trip but they didn\u2019t. Alright. The dude working said the best he can do is to heat up the last two vegan slices for me that HIS WORDS: been sitting on the shelf pretty much all day. I never should\u2019ve agreed because the slices did taste like they indeed been at least a day old (I swear, the overnight leftover pizza tastes more fresh) and I think he lied about hitting them up because after a 7 minute car ride back home it was absolutely cold. He didn\u2019t even offer neither a discount for the old stale slices nor an apology for not making the pre-ordered pie. What a joke of a place.",

The last 40 minutes I called and called again with no answer and busy tones. Finally they answered after 3 minutes of ringing and they said their phone's were down. That's funny... I didn't realize it of commission phones could get busy signals. Never patronizing again.  Edit: broke down and decided to give them a second chance. It's been an hour and a half since ordering on grub hub. Called them and asked what's the status and it hasn't even gone out for delivering. They said they are really \"backed up\". Really pro crew over there...",

Then they ran out of mushrooms for someone's pizza (how do you run out of one of the most common vegetables?) And when I came back and decided on a mozzarella sandwich, they were out of fresh mozzarella (which is a staple of Italian food). Very disappointing. Apparently all they can manage to do is cheese pizza.  \u2014  Old review  Great local spot! Affordable and homey. They advocate against gentrification and for other causes with the fliers in their window.  Everything here is vegetarian, which is entirely welcome, especially in a neighborhood that's not hipster. Most of their sandwiches are vegan, too.  I got their pasta for $6 (cheaper than even some other places on Broadway, such as Broadway Pizza). It was good. Decently large and cheesy and carby without being too saucy.  But another time I came in and they were out of pasta. How do you run out of pasta when you're an Italian restaurant? They were out of it for three days and had an attitude about it, too.  Love their values and their food. They need to get their inventory in order.",
