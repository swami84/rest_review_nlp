We could hear an employee at the back of the store in the kitchen area, and we waited politely to be served. After a few minutes it was apparent that the employee was not aware that we were there waiting to be served. I called out hello. The employee came to the front of the store, behind the counter, and as soon as he saw our Service animal he started to say that animals were not allowed in the store. Our service animal had her vest on and you could clearly see that one of the people in our party was disabled and needed the Service Animal. I politely explained that she was a service animal. He clearly wasn\u2019t happy, and I didn\u2019t push the matter further. My daughter ordered a smoothie. My daughter sat down at one of the open stools by the counter and the employee was quick to tell her she couldn\u2019t sit there. She wasn\u2019t able to sit anywhere, everywhere we tried to stand, lean or sit while we waited for her smoothie this employee took great pleasure in informing us that we couldn\u2019t sit because of COVID. Mind you this employee did not wear a facial mask at all the entire time, however he was behind his plexi-glass. I couldn\u2019t help feeling as if he was punishing us for something. While I was paying I saw that they sell C4 drinks \u2013 I took one out of the fridge with a bottle of water, and asked him to ring everything up. It was then that he told me he wasn\u2019t going to sell the C4 to me. I asked him why, and he looked at me, and told me they didn\u2019t have it. I looked at the can of C4 and looked at him and said \u2013 you do sell it, here it is. He looked at me again and said \u2013 no it\u2019s not in our system I am not selling it to you. Honestly I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was shocked. This was the first time ever that someone has refused to sell me anything in their store. I looked at him dumbfounded, and he looked at me and smiled. This employee actually discriminated against us because of our legal, certified service animal. I will never go back, ever.",
