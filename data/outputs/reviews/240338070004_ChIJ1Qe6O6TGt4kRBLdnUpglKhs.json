I've had the pho several times when dining in was an option, now I'm more into the noodle dishes that seem to travel better.  The various bun combinations are all great, rice vermicelli alongside grilled meats and chopped vegetables that give a wonderful range of flavors and textures.  Prices are very reasonable too.

The food has always been spectacular and it's a shame to have such dreadful experiences from a place my wife and I love to eat at.

I visited the location often because Groupon offers a special that you can pay $12 for a $20 Groupon worth of food ... today though I went at 10:31 am. after my nail appointment which is in the same parking lot ... I saw a Latina lady standing outside leaned up against the gas stations real and I grab the door to see that photo light was not open as their website says... As Google says... And what's printed on the door... So I stood there until 10:36 a.m. only to have the line cook Latina event does not speak English is entering in the door by an employee opening the door which is a hostess ... the young lady says that they're closed I asked her why because according to what's online and what's on the door they open at 10:30 a.m. she replies I don't know call Jenny the manager and gave me her cell phone number, upon calling Jenny and speaking with her she passed the phone off to a person named David. My question for calling management is by now that I have spoken to them and receive the call back by 10:45 why do they advertise that the police opens at 10:30 and the young lady with the purple hair that's a Latina state that they are not open until 11 ... And I asked this Latina with purple hair several times at least three times why do they have it on the door opening at 10:30 and now its 10:36 ... yes David did apologize but then blamed it on them being college students, I suggested that he find new college students that would actually honor and value their job versus having people that are rude to the customer and brush them all off... I also inform him that this young lady is rude every single time I come in with my Groupon... And so far it's been five times with my Groupon and the only reason why I keep purchasing the Groupon is because the food is good ... this place seems to lack good management David even express that they have multiple locations which had nothing to do with why I called and I don't care about other locations I do care about the location that opened up late that I stood in front of for 6 minutes and they refuse to serve me and decided to open up 29 minutes later ... if I can give them zero Stars I totally would ... based off of the customer service but I continue to receive from this Latina with purple hair",

The food was mediocre at best, thier was a rushed/annoyed vibe, this paired with the female cooks attitude and outbursts just made this one of the most unpleasant and uncomfortable experiences. Throwing tantrums about food orders coming in and making  repetitive comments like \" they're lucky I have this, or that\". Was very close to just walking out before my food came out.  Then they forgot stuff on my order. I was actually happy, less of my hard earned money for this establishment.  Where was management?? Your operation needs a serious overhaul.",

Food was always great and service was fine, especially during the \u201cHappy Hour 1/2 Bowl Specials.\u201d  However, I went last night around 8:30 PM, while we were eating, a small family of 3 came in at 9:03 and one of the waiters there said they were closed.  However, both the sign on the door and hours posted on Google mentioned it closed at 9:30. Two additional families came in and the woman waited denied them all service even though it was 9:15.  Considering this is a COLLEGE TOWN, why deny hungry guests a late night meal?!  There are 3 competing pho restaurants in the area and I probably won\u2019t be coming here again.  Also, the same waiter denying the other guests and the 1 chef that was there were loudly arguing with each other about their competence. Note, there are only 3 employees working and 10 guests present.  They were arguing about things along the line of how many wings there are supposed to be in one of the recent take out orders and the other being confused, which led to frustration. It was extremely unprofessional.  It\u2019s a shame because the food is quite good, but not good enough to put aside the fact that in 6 years it hasn\u2019t really gotten a makeover, the service that evening was extremely poor, and the very rude and unprofessional staff.",

My family and I had the menus thrown on the table, we were ready to order and sat and waited almost 20 minutes and even waved at the waitresses so that they could see we were ready and they act like they didn\u2019t see us, so we got up and just left. Another family that was there told us that they could not believe the type of customer service there was. No wonder they have a Groupon, no one wants to go there, especially with the type of service they have. I would not recommend this place at all.",

These days it takes more than 20 mins for the overworked waiters to even notice you and take your orders. My most recent visit had my order wrong. It took me over 15 mins to get the waiter's attention. He apologized and went to the cook to bring the missing items. The cook denied his mistake and sent the waiter back to pretty much say that the customer was wrong. The waiter then took the utensil that I was eating with from my hand and dug around through my plate of food, then told me, \"yea you're right, but sorry I can't do anything, since the cook said he did it correctly\". We love their food and this has been our go to pho spot for years, but we're not sure if we should continue to support their poor management.",

Spoke to manager, whose only response was to complain about the water pressure as if I should just tolerate the contaminated dishes. \"What do you want me to do about it?\" he asked. Really? You run a restaurant with that attitude? Unbelievable. At this point I grabbed my coat and left with my lunchmate, despite that our pho had just been delivered to the table. Will not be back.",

Overall I thought the pho was decent. The broth was a bit on the salty side but it was tasty. It did need some sauce though so it wasnt the best broth. In terms of service, it was a bit lacking. We didnt get any water and we didnt get a plate of garnish with our pho. We got the happy hour thai tea which is a dollar. The thai tea is normally sweet with a nice vanilla after taste. This one was very watered down which was sad to see. I think that if a store is going to choose to have a happy hour special, that is their decision and they should not sacrifice quality to have the deal. Overall, I would maybe come back but only for half-off pho since im a broke college student.",

I always stop by here for Pho rather than the other locations off Route 1 because of the easy parking, specials and the broth doesn't have that MSG taste.
