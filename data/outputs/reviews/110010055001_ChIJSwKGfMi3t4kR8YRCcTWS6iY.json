I ordered a Massamun Curry in medium spicy which was good for who love spicy food like me (the spiciness is a Thai standard so it might be spicier that you\u2019d expect). The vegetables in the curry was weirdly proportioned - there was like one piece of bell pepper, one piece of green bean, and a lot of onions lol. Not that it affects the flavor but just found it odd and funny. I definitely love the Massamun curry, it was very rich and flavorful.  My boyfriend ordered a Pad Thai chicken which the sauce/flavor was good but there was no vegetables included except bean sprouts and green onions. We were expecting to have some carrots, maybe peppers or chives and lime but didn\u2019t have those.  The servers were very nice and friendly. One other thing was that the bathroom was gross. If someone went there before the meal or in between, they probably will lose their appetite. Luckily, I went after my meal.",

I have asked them to provide more rice before but get an attitude and they say I should pay an additional $2 for more rice! for the price of rice they should provide a commesurate amount. look at the picture, you get maybe 1/4 cup of rice post-cooked that is NOT ENOUGH. The annoying part is that I get home and have to fire up the pan and cook more rice. This is unacceptable.
