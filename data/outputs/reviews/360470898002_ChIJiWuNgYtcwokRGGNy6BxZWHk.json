How can they taste the food, think it\u2019s good, and distribute it......  laad God. Hmmmm I won\u2019t judge too hard though because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve tasted everything they\u2019ve made.    I ordered the Rice&Peas with The Honey Glazed Chicken..   hmmmm chicken was definitely old tasting and looking. You could tell that they\u2019ve cooked it over and over for many days. The scent of the seasoning they used nearly knocked me out, how the f*** you give me something so strong that the smell alone turns me off. The rice wasn\u2019t half bad but the way they drenched it with the killer sauce was despicable. The rice also could\u2019ve been cooked a little more. Majority of the people in the comments section definitely can\u2019t be lying, so everyone who is considering to eat here, please take heed of what we\u2019re saying. I wouldn\u2019t say to put them out of business because that wouldn\u2019t be right, but don\u2019t buy what all of us has bought. Try something else, just because what we had was awful, doesn\u2019t mean that the other foods they make are horrible as well.  Good day.",

Even if you were to add a .75cents tax thats fine but in truth it's not worth it if you paying more than that...cause there are other places that can satisfy you for the right buck.....",

Poor attitudes and sloppy delivery service, they will not be in business for long. The driver had the nerve once I canceled my order through Grub hub to call me 2 and a half hours later and say that he is on his way so I hung up on him. Then he calls again trying to explain his sorry story to me and I hung up again!

I was placed on hold until I walked 3 blocks then I called again the same time I walked in the only order before my order was one uber eats. I told the woman serving that I have had the worst experience  placing orders over the phone. I ordered a large jerk chicken meal with stew gravy and she felt the need to go to the guy cooking in the back to whisper while cutting the chicken. When I opened my meal there was no vegetables. She said nothing to me I asked her where is the vegetables. Absolutely no customers service skills. Very unprofessional.  My first uber eats they called me and told me they were out of everything I ordered. I had to call uber to cancel . I was better off getting Chinese food since they know how to take an order over the phone don't even know if she spit in my food. If I knew how to give a half or third of a star that's the grade they would get. Would never get food a stumpy spot.",
