There is something about a restaurant that only does one thing, and does that one thing incredibly well. In this case, TLC fries up some amazing chicken tenders.  The pieces are sizeable and satisfying to eat. The breading on the tenders are super crispy and well balanced in salt and umami. The meat within is juicy and flavorful. The sauces are interesting and varied. The prices are reasonable. If you are tired of tenders that are soggy, stringy, bland, overly salty, tiny as nuggets, or just plain bad, look no further. TLC got exactly what you need!",
