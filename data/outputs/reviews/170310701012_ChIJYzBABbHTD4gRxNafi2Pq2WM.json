They had a lunch buffet special so we all decided to try that to sample the food. I had the lamb curry, chicken curry, chana masala, palak paneer, samosa, and rice for the main course. I usually don't eat a lot of lamb but I liked how it was made here. They brought us naan bread as well. I wish I could have tried their other naan bread because there was a variety of them on the non-buffet menu.  Overall I think the curries could have been spicier but there was enough of a slow heat that built up with time. The temperature of the food could have been a tad warmer but it was a buffet so that's kind of expected. For dessert, I had both the rice pudding and double ka meetha. I never had these desserts in this fashion before and I was very pleased with them. For my group the double ka meetha stole the show. Some even went back for thirds. The staff was attentive in making sure we had enough water and other drinks. I would like to try this place again when I'm by Lincoln Park Zoo. It wasn't that far of a walk from there.",

Among the sides, the chili and garlic naan and coconut rice were phenomenal, and while the raita was more liquid than expected it was still very good. For dinner, the Madras chicken korma was very tender and had a good amount of spice. The rasmalai for dessert was very sweet, so I would recommend chai to go with it. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, everything was prepared in a good amount of time. It's not especially cheap (about $18 for an entree and rice), but it's worth the cost.",
