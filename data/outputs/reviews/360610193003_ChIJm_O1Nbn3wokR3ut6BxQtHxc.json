My sincere apologies for the inconvenience and misunderstanding, but i do believe we Don Ramon Restaurant have really good fair prices and no prices did not change from tuesday til Thursday like that guy claims please speak facts and stop trying to give this upcoming business a bad name when the facts are not correct, as i stated my apoligies for the misundersatnding Thankyou all God bless and hope to see you soon tasting the delicious food we provide",

        "caption": "So. I went here this past Tuesday. Had great conversation with the staff, while I waited for my to-go order. And let me tell you - The food is fantastic! Reminds me of my Tita's cooking. Well seasoned, cooked to perfection (Not that chewy stuff you get sometimes) and delicious. So great experience. I got enough food for both me and my kid that lasted us 2.5 days! Got a great price which was even slightly lower than the listed price due to some inconveniences, but the original amount was 18 bucks, I got it at a 2 dollar discount for the inconvenience. Awesome, right?  Now, the reason for 2 stars... today I send my kid there who goes to school right across the street and I even video chat with the staff to put in THE SAME EXACT ORDER + Maduros (sweet fried plantains). I even clarify on the order of vegetables to make sure they're the same as the one from Tuesday cause they were so good and they confirmed the order verbatim (Cauliflower, Asparagus, Broccoli and Carrots). My kid gets home and I'm super hungry and looking forward to their delicious food... And yup you guessed it... A few problems arise. Now, orders get messed, it happens. I wouldn't be upset about that unless it's a recurring issue. Anyway, here it is...  1.The order of vegetables I got were NOTHING like the one I got on Tuesday. Dry, steamed and stiff. They weren't even the correct vegetables that we confirmed over video chat!! The ones from Tuesday were seasoned, medium texture and delicious and included cauliflower and asparagus. 2. Remember when I said the original Price was 18 bucks for my first visit... well, I guess inflation got crazy and the order increased by 11 dollars! WTH!? Keep in mind that it was my kid ordering the food this time since this place is on the way home. Either inflation is getting ridiculous or my kid got jipped. Yup, Me Enga\u00f1aron la Ni\u00f1a. It's one thing to get the order wrong, another to take advantage of a kid. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. 3. So I decide to call to clarify. And the response is..... drum roll.......... the price went up since Tuesday. Wow. Assuming an order of plaintains cost 3-4 bucks... in 2 days the price went up by 8 dollars! I don't believe it for a second. Not a smart way to retain customers and I eat out almost EVERYDAY. Was hoping this place to be a replacement for the equally fantastic (but pricey) Tropical Sensation.  Look, I still recommend this place, Great food, but this left a bad taste in my mouth non-the-less. I really wanted this to be my new go-to place. Not sure after this experience.  I NEVER Write reviews, but this got me tight. Unnacceptable. You're a new place, I get it, but impressions matter. Even if the staff would have responded in a less ridiculous way, this would have been squashed immediately. It's not about the money, it's the principle.",
