He stopped me at the door and told us to sit down and we had a great time.  My kids ate duck for the first time and all the food was good. I understood later that man at the door is the owner and a more gracious man you will not find and find food to boot. I felt out of place walking in but they made me feel right at home, thank you.

This particular burger option comes with what they call \u201cChef calls it daily\u201d (and several other menu items have this as well), which means that the chef takes his/her creative liberties with that particular food item on a day by day basis \u2013 so, it may not be the same the next time you order it. The menu even contains an item labeled, get this, \u201cShut up and eat\u201d, no description, nothing, just a full meal of whatever the chef decides to put in front of you (check out their lunch menu and see for yourself). I\u2019ll have to admit, I\u2019m a little intrigued by this idea\u2026  Anyway, I digress. The chef\u2019s options for my burger this day included saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions and I can\u2019t remember what cheese, but believe me, as this burger also included your standard lettuce, pickles, tomato, and onion on the side\u2026I did not need to add those at all. The flavors from what the chef \u2018called\u2019 were more than enough. Plus, I ordered the burger medium rare and that\u2019s exactly what it was \u2013 these cooks know their stuff.  I am going back here and I urge you to try this place out \u2013 you will not be disappointed.",
