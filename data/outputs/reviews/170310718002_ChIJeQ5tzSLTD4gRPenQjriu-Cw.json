The A/C was blasting which in part makes you feel so uncomfortable. My mom had to asked to turned it off. They complied but with an attitude. The white lady with long brown hair which I assume was the manager had a very discussed look as if she was doing a favor to us to eat there. She presented herself as bother by our request. On the last time which was Friday August 30. The restaurant was completely empty, very cold again. They turned down the a/c, we were almost finished with our meal and enjoying our coffee when suddenly the Cold air came out blasting, our coffee got cold right away and my mother starting getting sick! The temperature out was below 70! We left the restaurant immediately. My mom which is a famous barber in an Elite barber shop in downtown Chicago and eats in more expensive restaurants swore to never eat here again not to tell her customers who live in the area. She used to tell people about it. Management does not care about customer service. Woman only care about the money we spent there. The restaurant was completely empty on Friday for hours while all the others around had lines outside. What a shame. The only one person who treat us with outmost respect and service was the Black gentlemen, he should work in a better place!!",

The penne serving was barely enough to put in a coffee cup.  This $12.25 serving took 9 bites to consume and taste rated a \"C\".  The cheesecake at $7.75 was served plain with no topping or fruit and was a miniature slice of a cake comparable to what is purchased from a vending machine!  This meal barely was worth $8, much less $25.  I have asked Seamless to remove Pizza Capri from the restaurants they use!!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!",

We wanted to dine in, and were told we had to pay upfront first which was no problem. So it came time to order drinks they only have cans of pop, coffee and iced tea. Well, they keep all the cans of pop in a clear refrigerator so you can pick what you want, and one of the employees was sitting on the counter blocking my view, and when she saw I was struggling to see she rolled her eyes and then moved. I'd like to add that I'm sure she is a nice enough girl but someone with her temperament should probably work in a job where she doesn't need to interact with people. She was cold and unfriendly. Also, if you ever eaten there you know its fairly small...  I literally heard the host say the f word at least 3 times, and make comments about how bored he was. In my opinion that is totally unacceptable. The pizza was good, but not enough to make me go back. In conclusion if your customer service expectations exceed what you would expect at McDonalds don't waste your time here.",

There is zero ambiance so it's a great place to pick up food to take somewhere else or get delivery. It has all of your typical pizza and pasta dishes, but the Bolognese was really a very hearty, saucy dish. I had meaty, flavorful wings from here as well. The calamari was just so-so, as I guessed it might be. Don't expect gourmet, but the quick eats do the trick.",
