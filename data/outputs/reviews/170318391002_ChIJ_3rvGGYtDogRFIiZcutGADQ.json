I\u2019m not sure why they THOUGHT replacing my ICED GREEN TEA with a ICED BLACK TEA. Would be okay. Well, maybe had they told me they didn\u2019t have green tea . NOPE. Took it upon herself to just pass ICED BLACK TEA . Maybe she thought I didn\u2019t know my colors ???? Maybe she thought I wouldn\u2019t know the difference ???? I don\u2019t know. But I do know she wasted my time... you just can\u2019t give customers anything as a replacement. Maybe I\u2019m wrong . But one thing I do know... that wasn\u2019t green tea. Again. Great job to the cashier.",

Once we were inside and after a very short wait we encountered a young lady named Lele. She was working very hard and efficiently by herself taking and fulfilling customer orders systematically so that no one has time to complain that she was working the by herself. When she had a moment she told us that the person who was supposed to be there with her was unfortunately involved in an accident earlier and was unable to make it to work. Nonetheless, Lele worked quickly and with a great personality/ attitude to satisfy each and every customer. She's a great asset to the company and I hope her hard work and dedication is recognized and pays off for her.",
