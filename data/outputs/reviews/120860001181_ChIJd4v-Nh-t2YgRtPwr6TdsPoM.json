The food was okay (not spectacular or honestly anything that would have made us want to come back) but the service was poor. We sat for 25 minutes (debating leaving) before anyone took our drink order. When the food was delivered there was no explanation on various sauces and no bowl for shells, etc...No one checked-in on us during the meal and empty glasses and dishes piled-up. As we were leaving the table adjacent to us was hollering and waving their arms to try capture someone's attention to get service. Perhaps they were short staffed but based on our experience we wouldn't go back since there are plenty of other places in the area with exceptional food and service.",

I didn\u2019t send it back or anything because she was so nice, but at any other place I probably would have. This restaurant is blessed to have this woman working here. Unfortunately, me and my friend both thought our entrees were grossly overpriced for simple boiled potatoes that did *not* taste fresh at all (kind of that weird taste they get when boiled potatoes are a day old...) and a cheap/poor cut of fish with bones. The appetizer was good but the entree was not edible, sadly.  :(  I\u2019m giving 3 stars instead of one because her service really saved the review. Honestly, unfortunately, I would never go here again.",

I haven\u2019t been to Old Lisbon in ages (I moved out of Miami) and this past weekend we decided to try the Sunny Isles location to celebrate a birthday. I was extremely happy at how welcoming the staff was in helping me grab the cake I brought in and put my flowers into water since the moment I walked in. Our party ordered multiple items from the menu, from steak, chicken to seafood. Food didn\u2019t disappoint, flavor was exquisite and fresh. We ordered a sangria that was perfect for a warm, sunny, Florida day. Fatima, our server, was friendly and kind, going beyond to make us feel special. After our dessert, to our surprise and such an Old Lisbon tradition , Porto was served to us. Thank you to all the staff that made our birthday lunch so special; our party was grateful and pleased that the restaurant has maintained what we loved and remembered from many years ago, feeling like family.",

You can order takeout or sit, socially distant, on the covered patio. With the ocean breeze and fans, it's a very nice experience - especially in the evening. As always, highly recommended.  What can I say? Old Lisbon is a Miami staple bringing excellent Portuguese food to life. It's clear that the food comes from the heart. I don't know if these are family recipes but they sure taste like it.  I've had the paella many times and would say that, if you like paella, you'll love theirs.  But don't limit yourself, try the Bolinhos de Bacalhau and Clams in a White Wine. Also try the steak with a fried egg or the lamb chops. You really can't go wrong.  Bring your friends and family and you will feel like you're in Portugal. Enjoy!",

We arrived and the so called Manager informed us that our open table reservations was cancelled and he did not have anything and we should have received a cancellation email. We did not. He then proceeded to tell us to leave which I felt very insulted. He started yelling and insulting us in Spanish which I understand and said that if we don\u2019t leave he will call the police. Wow. That is how a restaurant treats customers? I used to go a few times a year to the restaurant and this is a true way to lose a client and much more. I was never treated that way in any restaurant. I travel a lot and go to restaurants everywhere and never have I seen such bad behavior. This restaurant is managed badly by a manager that should never manage anything. He makes customers feel unsafe and I will never step into that restaurant and I always keep my word. I can\u2019t recommend a restaurant that is disrespectful intimidating and insulting to anyone. Keep away from Old Lisbon in Sunny Isles.",

Every time we go there we sit down and no one comes to the table to greet us or take a drink or appetiser order , then finally the manager or the host comes and takes our order    But no drinks or wine.   ???  Then minutes later I wave to the bus girl that just walks around all night, to order wine and drinks for the table.   It was my mother\u2019s birthday and when I called I mentioned it to the manager.  And when I sat down I told the bus girl.  No cake or a candle or any care on there part.   It\u2019s a shame the food is good.  But\u201d what\u2019s the point if the service is horrible.",

In my experience, managers only show up when there\u2019s an issue (too late) or to do table rounds and ask if everything is up to par yet fail to give his 100% attention to your comments. Not this manager, he took his time to walk us to our table, he suggested his favorite dishes as well as the top sellers and he came to check on us several times throughout our dinning experience. This was what gave this restaurant the WOW Factor. That\u2019s what all restaurant managers should be doing. Making the clients feel special and acknowledged.

After being seated and reviewing menu, we noticed that we were given the dinner menu.  We arrived at 1:40 and completed reviewing the dinner menu at 1:45.  Asked if there was a lunch menu due to the fact our party did not want large portions.  Lunch menu is served 12 to 2 PM, I know this after going to the South Miami restaurant many times.  Rene appeared to be agitated, after he realized he should have given us the lunch menu and provides us the dinner menu which would have resulted in much higher costs for our party.  Ordered drinks and service was non existent from Rene and he hurried us along when we ordered drinks of which my wife could not even indicate she wanted wine.  We called another waitress who had served my wife and a large group of friends on previous visits to this location.  Never saw Rene again for service.  Other waiters/waitresses served us which was great.  The food in our opinion  was better at the South Miami location and the service was much better.  The only time Rene appeared again was to provide the billed quickly and hurry us along.  Unfortunately, our party was not pleased with the service and negative attitude from what appeared to be a manager.  Other waiters and waitresses attention made up for the unpleasant experience.  Will not be coming to this location again.",

I feel they were trying to make a statement with the exaggerated amount of olive oil... yes, olive oil is delicious, but no need ro drink as a soup. The potatoes were hard and completely raw. The cod that comes shredded and with egg, forgot the name of the plate, was boring, dry, and flavorless. We sat by the window and we were all sweating, I think the AC does not reach that second cealing. The service was wonderful and the cod was great quality and fresh, but please, pay attention to the details. We could not stay for dessert and coffee due to the heat.",

We were rtying to ask her another question but she started talking to another customer in the middle of our sentence. Her dismissal was very rude. After we went to the bar, we werent acknowledged at all. There were other people came after us (at the bar) and they were served. nobody asked us if we wanted to order anything.

The place is very nicely decorated and the service impeccable. The problem is at the kitchen, I ordered the lamb chops w crispy potatoes, well the lamb chops were medium rare as requested but the grill marks tasted so bitter that was very dificulte to disguise the taste to my guest and the potatoes so soft and bland that I didn't have any. My guest order the cod casserole in sea of tomato soup w two whole potatoes and 4 pieces of cod. Wanting to end the lunch in good terms no body said a word.
