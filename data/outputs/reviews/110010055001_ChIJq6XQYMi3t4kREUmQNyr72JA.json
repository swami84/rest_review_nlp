It's a small, relaxed restaurant where the menus are hand-made and they regularly just keep bringing you delicious food. I trust that everything I will eat there will be carefully prepared and delicious. As such, I can always feel confident trying new items. The bread and cheese are fantastic and come from a common serving table in the middle of the restaurant. It's not cheap, but you pay for consistency and quality. If we haven't seen friends for a while and they're only in town for a short time, we'll take them here. You can enjoy a 2-hour meal that never feels rushed and is full of new incredible dishes to talk about.",

They constantly change the menu (non-veg and veg) and the trademark Obelisk mix of creative and classic compels us to try one or both almost every week. The food is always impeccable, whether it's the latest seasonal dish or a classic (like the bread and burrata - the only part of the menu that never changes, nor should it, because it is perfect and you can never have enough). Prices include service and it's a good value for the high quality ingredients. The \"worst\" dish we've had since they reopened has still been great-to-excellent; the best have been transcendental, even at home. We often split one menu, adding 1-2 a la carte items to round it out. This is the right amount of food to keep trying their new offerings each week and avoid overeating, but sometimes tests our love for each other as it's tempting to eat each entire delectable dish for yourself! (Tip: Eat the hot dishes first and save the cold ones for last, even if that means partially inverting the menu.) A la carte items also make a great lunch. The sandwiches are petite but so, so tasty (I hope they bring back the egg and homemade sausage soon!) and round out well with a soup or salad, and the lasagna is fantastic (tip: request to buy it cold if you want to heat it yourself the next day).  Pre-COVID, this was also a lovely experience for in-person dining. It's a given that the food will be incredible. The service was also fantastic, the venue intimate, the meals leisurely-paced and delightful. We can't wait to go back in person when it's safe!",

        "caption": "My husband had fed me well for every special occasion. For his 30th (and since I do finally have a grown up job), it was my turn to return the favor.  I chose Obelisk after learning their tasting menu changes daily. It was a risky choice since i didn't have a clue what would appear on their menu that day. We went in keeping our fingers crossed hoping that they were serving attractive options. And we definitively were not disappointed!  Antipasti - smoked swordfish, grilled stuffed sausage, grilled pepper, fried fish, and burrata. I wasn't a big cheese fan to begin with (I actually asked if I could swap the cheese course for something else) but their burrata was a life changer! Soft, creamy, and light - I ate two whole breadbasket with smear of their scrumptious burrata alone!  Primi - arugula ravioli and spaghetti with clam - both pasta dishes could had been a meal on their own. Definition of perfectly made pasta!  Secondi - bass and quail. My husband enjoyed his bass but didn't think it was too memorable. He wasn't a big fan of the slaw salad pairing. I, on the other hand, picked up my whole quail and attempted to eat every piece of meat off the bone. Tender, juicy - out of the world!  Cheese - I'm so glad they said no to swapping my cheese course. I initially was just going to take a small bite of each but ended up polishing my plate clean! The hazelnut berry jam was the perfect compliment!  Desserts - chocolate chestnut cake and rosa pudding. The cake was nutty and moist but wasn't sweet enough - perhaps should had been paired with some type of ice cream or sweeter cream? My rosa pudding was really runny and didn't have the consistency of a pudding. It was also overwhelmingly sweet - what a contrast to their cake.  Overall - attractive, ever changing menu - perhaps we just came on a bad night for their desserts. Most of the dishes nevertheless were something I would definitely return for more! Service was a bit of a miss - we placed our order prior to the group of 6 next to us but they were served a whole course before us. We sat around for 25 minutes between each course. Our servers were not apologetic and offered no explanation. Ultimately, our 5 course dinner took over 3 hrs. Perhaps it was because we didn't order wine...  4 stars for food, 3 stars for service - Bad service really spoil dining experience! In sum 3.5 stars.",

        "caption": "Located not too far from the heart of Dupont Circle, Obelisk is a true treasure find in Washington. A five-course Italian tasting menu reveals fantastic dishes with artistic performances. The parade of antipasti, pastas, and desserts makes this restaurant one of the most authentic, elegant, and flavorful in DC. The menu changes daily, but the top notch attentive service and dressy casual romantic intimate nature of the restaurant are forever the same. Located in a brownstone, the restaurant seems almost residential with close and cozy tables and it feels like you're inside someone's tasteful living room. There is limited seating so definitely make reservations.  Unlike other upscale restaurants with five course meals that seem more like one course meals, Obelisk's five courses are surprisingly very, very filling. The antipasti alone feels like an entire dinner, so I recommend you pace yourself when eating. Pastas are the restaurant's strength, but the meat and fish dishes are just as impressive. Obelisk is prix-fixe at $75 and there is a wine pairing option.  The restaurant has been around for 26 years and has been consistently known as DC's top Italian place for more than two decades, an impressive feat in the ever-changing culinary world. I came here with my boyfriend and close friends to celebrate his birthday and everyone loved the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere. It was such a perfect evening and we were all stuffed afterwards!",
