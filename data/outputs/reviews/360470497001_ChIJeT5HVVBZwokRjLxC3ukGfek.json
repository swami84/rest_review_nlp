Having become a regular, had a nice conversation with the waitress, tried to order Chips and Salsa ($ 5.00 ! ) and a happy hour margarita. I was told I had to order the $ 10.00 guacamole at minimum. That isn't the law, that is them taking the \"have to order food\" order and gouging people using it.  There were plentynof empty tables and I probably would have ordered more but with that attitude, I opted to move on and will not return.  Another one bites the dust. Sad.",

It was too watery, and in my opinion, it should be thicker.  Unfortunately, the margaritas were quite terrible. For a place called Margaritas Sunset, I expected better. I'm not even sure what it was composed of, but my regular margarita tasted just like lime Gatorade.  Decent food, terrible drinks, average atmosphere and service.",

This place is too expensive to be eating with my hands and eating it with a spoon just wont work. Im not sure of the logic here. I went back tonite because the bartender is hot and I knew there would be a seat at the bar. It was 2 female bartenders and me in the place. They would not shut up. They just kept blabbing the whole time in spanish. I planned to leave right at closing but they turned on ALL the lights and started sweeping the floor around me!

There are serviceable options nearby, but both lack the ambiance to sit and drink margaritas, tequila, and beer.  I came here for food and happy hour (and was the only table) which turned into food and sad hour. Their namesake \"....Margaritas....\" were a huge letdown. I'm willing to pay full price for a margarita with some kick, but since it was happy hour, we ordered happy hour margaritas. Those were basically all sour + some sweet + <1oz of tequila = awful flavor.  The food was fine. The pork shoulder ($18) was tender and flavorful, the mole cheese enchiladas ($14) were spicy and flavorful. HOWEVER, they need to decide if they're an upscale Mexican restaurant, tequila bar, or other. If I'm paying $18 for an 8oz ramekin of pork, the service should be outstanding (same goes for 3 cheese enchiladas on tiny corn tortillas).  The service was abysmal. There were several servers there prepping for a hopefully busy Friday night. They shined the glasses, texted, talked, trained each other how to make cocktails, all while missing several cues from our table. Finally, when I asked for the check, I sat at the table for another 5 or so minutes while they finished shining glasses.  In summary, figure out your identity Las Margaritas Sunset. I can't tell if you're upscale, overpriced, or overrated.",
