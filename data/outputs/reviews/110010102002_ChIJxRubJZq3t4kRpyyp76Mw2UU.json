The grilled avocado was delicious, it had a grilled taste but still tasted like a normal avocado. The quinoa was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms and onions tasted savory and delicious. The sauce was also very delicious, sweet yet savory. My only problem was that it was on spinach and I don't particularly like salads, this is not really a  problem because it was still delicious and a lot of people do like salads.",
