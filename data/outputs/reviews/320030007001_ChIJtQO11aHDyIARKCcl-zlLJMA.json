Unfortunately, the regular margarita was probably one of the worst I've ever had and, for the size, overpriced.  I switched it out for their strawberry margarita which wasn't great but was an improvement.  Chips and salsa are not automatically served so we ordered the chips and guacamole which was very fresh and delicious.  Had a chicken quesadilla which was pretty good but I think there are better Mexican restaurants in town with more reasonable priced food & drinks.",

We had a cool couch and table to hang around which is so much better than a stool to watch a football game,  so we were comfortable. Atmosphere was loud because of the tv but that's expected.  Lots of TVs with several sports on but catering to SNF game.  So far so good......  The food was \"Mexican \"  by description but not by taste.  I could barely taste the salsa that came with the chips. ($6.00)  I had a combo plate, taco--ground beef it was 'meh'   , a cheese enchilada. Had no distinction as to ingredients, just a hot mass of cheese, and a chicken quesadilla which was ok owing to the cilantro which makes anything taste good.  It was hot,   it looked appetizing but just did not do it for me--a native so cal guy-- on any level.  There ya go, it was convenient and friendly but not very tasty.",

A waitress showed up eventually and first thing she asked was if we had been helped yet... Got our food, no silverware, had to go ask at the hostess stand because we couldn't find our waitress, waited forever for the check, just about left cash on the table and walked out when she finally showed up with the check.

In other words, she refused to stamp her name on her poor service. I will be calling back tonight. Never experienced anything like this in Las Vegas before.

We started off with some Guacamole and Muy Caliente buffalo wings.  The guac was good, and the wings were HOT!!!!  So hot in fact that they were punishing our chapped lips that were damaged from spending too much time in the sun at Red Rock Canyon earlier that day.  Never fear, for we discovered that it was possible to still enjoy the wings if you simply used your fork to strip off all of the meat and delicately insert it into your mouth without coming into contact with our over-sensitive, sun-damaged lips.  There were plenty of TVs to enjoy various sporting events, and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive.",
