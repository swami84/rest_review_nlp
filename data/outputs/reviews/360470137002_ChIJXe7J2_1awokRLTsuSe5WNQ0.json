I ordered the Lemongrass grilled pork chops with rice along with the Tom Khai soup which is a coconut vegetables coup that is not spicy but a little sweet and sour.  I also ordered an authentic dessert that I had never had before.  It was a banana cake but it is wrapped in leaves that has sweet sticky rice that wraps around a banana and I believe is some red beans.  Quite delicious.  Overall a very pleasant experience.  Definitely deserve a 5 stars rating.  Will certainly come again to try the other food.",

Its not a fancy place at all, but quite reasonable.  Appetizers are less than $10, and most entrees are between $10 and $20. Sat down and ordered a Thai Ice tea. It was standard. I then ordered the chicken wings. Now, those wings were really good. They were light crispy on the outside, and tender and moist on the inside. I also have to thank our server Boom, yes her name was Boom and she was very nice. Since it was around lunch time, actually 2pm, the lunch special was still valid.  U thought about ordering the grilled pork chop, but since i had some a day prior, i was convinced by Boom to have the Red snapper with mango salad draped over it. Wow, this dish was also quite good. Crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. I really enjoyed it and it was a nice big piece of fish. Boom kept us entertained and customers were coming in on a regualr basis. I had the coconut ice vream which was not sweet but also quite good. Everything came in good sized proportions.  Next time i am in Park Slope amd in the mood for Thai food, i can certainly come here.",

Upon entering the restaurant to pick up my food, the first thing I noticed was a really pungent smell of dirty mop water. I am not a person with a sensitive nose, so if I say something smells, that means it really reeks.  That didn't deter me from getting my food though. I have never eaten here before if that wasn't clear. Something told me to look at my food before I paid for it. I found wierd looking friend chicken wings with chili sauce on the side. And 4 small, i mean SMALL, curry puffs. My total was $14 for these 2 appetizers. You can call it cheap,  but I call it principle. I'm not paying $7 for some tiny curry puffs that look like they came from a BJs hors d d'oeuvres box. And I have been to many Thai places, and never saw wings served like that. I have seen better Thai Chili wings at Applebees. I politely let the cashier know I was no longer interested in purchasing and left.  I would steer clear of this stinky overpriced place.",

We were seated by the person who was answering the phone/the server to customers/barman/ et. In a nutshell he was the only person attending to customers.  After being seated by the \"jack of all trade\", we waited for 10 minutes before he returned to us... he took our order; a few minutes later we were given water.  Our appertizer took 20 minutes to arrive at the table.  After the appertizer we waited for another 30 minutes... no main course came out.  At this point, my spouse got up and sought the \"jack of all trade\" out;  and asked to pay for the appertizer & water.  Jack of all trade excuse was that what we ordered takes a long time to cook.  If it takes a long time to cook; then take it off your menu...  BTW as were sitting, Jack of All trade was taking phone orders which were being sent out promptly.  We counted 10 bags with food being taken out by their delivery person.",
