My birthday party accommodations were good up to 630pm. Then the restaurant got crowded and they tried to seat everyone that came through the door, eventhough they gave us such a hard time about our reservation. Once their business started to pick up, the service started to suffer and was lacking from there on out. Our server was seen far and few in between and we had to keep seeking him out. The tables and parties were sat too close together and although there were signs at each table about mask wearing at the table at all times unless you are eating or drinking and if you get up to use restroom for example, these rules weren't enforced. Patrons treated the mask wearing mandate as mearly a suggestion.",

I discovered Perry's Restaurant, a multi-level restaurant that serves Japanese fare, sushi, and specialty cocktails. They offer happy hour from 4-6pm daily. They have a nice rooftop bar with heated lamps. Reservations are encouraged. However, walk-ins are accepted.  You have to go up two long flights of stairs to get to the rooftop. I'll admit the second flight of stairs was a bit too steep. I'm glad I wasn't wearing high heels or had too many drinks.  Most of my friends ordered beers. Since I'm not a beer drinker, I decided to get the Zentini, which consisted of vodka, ginger infused sake, and agave pomegranate juice shaken and served in a champagne coupe and garnished with a lemon. It was light, fruity, and refreshing. I also ordered the Harasu Hako Sushi, which consisted of sushi rice topped with seared salmon belly, ikura, micro greens, and savory aioli sliced into six pieces and served with sushi ginger and wasabi. Every bite was delicious. I'd definitely return when indoor dining is resumed or the weather is warmer, whichever comes first, to try their other dishes!",

Wouldn't go back, especially considering the many excellent restaurants in AdMo.  Update: looking at the RW menu, it was clear that the wasabi chip came across as the appetizer because the restaurant forgot to add the actual appetizer to our bag! We only received the sushi platter, mango crepe cake (which is what we received despite it being listed as a yuzu cheesecake), and wasabi chip.

The food was solid, but not amazing. I think most people will be happy with the food and I ate my fair share. Where I was most disappointed was the service. Part of our order came out wrong as the dish was suppose to be prepared with tempura flakes throughout it. When I noticed the discrepancy they brought a cup of flakes and simply poured it on top. This is not the service that I expect when paying over $100+ for sushi.  Lastly, we arrived at our reservation time of 7 PM and had finished eating about an hour later. My date wanted to order one additional Prosecco when we were told that we couldn\u2019t order anymore due to a time constraint (that we were not notified of when we arrived). I brought to their attention that there were not only tables available, but 5 tables who had arrived before us that they had said nothing to. I\u2019m fine with policies, as long as they are enforced equitably. I decided that I didn\u2019t want to give them anymore of my money re: the Prosecco and left. Also, that I just wouldn\u2019t be back.",

The sushi is excellent, but since I\u2019m vegetarian, I can\u2019t speak on the fish rolls. However, my good friend enjoyed his salmon rolls so I think they\u2019re a good choice.  What to know: the appetizers are more interesting than the sushi; huge wine/ whisky/ sake list; and the atmosphere is more romantic than casual.

The food was excellent (served buffet style) and there was a good selection of breakfast and lunch options as well as sweet, savory and salads.  The coffee was good and the drinks (a separate charge) all sounded interesting (the regular mimosa was nice).  The entertainment was phenomenal.  There were multiple queens who all performed and wandered around the tables.  They had cash on hand for change to tip the queens.  Great for a birthday, anniversary, wedding whatever.  They call out those with special events and give them extra attention.  There were plenty of people both young and old, male and female.  Bring everyone!",

He was knowledgeable about the menu and made several recommendations. The space on the roof can't be beat during a nice day.  The sushi platter my wife got was really good and had an interesting variation in the fish. My skewers were good, but a bit small. Also, the beef skewer was made with hanger steak and when you cook steak that small, you inevitably overcook it a bit and hanger doesn't hold up very well to that, it gets a bit chewy. The pork belly was delicious though.  We shared a bottle of sake and they treated us to a dessert (we were there for a personal milestone celebration).  We'll definitely be back!",

It's a large space that was not very busy on a Thursday night. Everything we ate was decent-to-good: the seaweed salad was pretty standard, the chicken kara-age appetizer was good (although not huge), the grilled hamachi entree was delicious, and the sushi was decent. Service was attentive, friendly, and helpful! Prices are reasonable although would probably add up if you tried to make a meal of the smaller plates. Most of the food didn't blow our socks off, but it was good enough that, combined with easy table availability, great service, and reasonable prices we would happily eat here again when in the neighborhood. Only complaint I had is that the restaurant had kind of a musky smell when I walked in, but I eventually stopped noticing it.",

Sarah, the event planner, is wonderful! She is incredibly organized, responsive, and thorough. We threw a lot of requests at her, and she worked hard to make sure that they were all fulfilled. She went above and beyond to make the space beautiful for our wedding and was thoughtful about every detail. She helped mollify everyone's day-of stresses and discretely managed all the complicated details of the event so that the evening flowed seamlessly. She even took a few photos and a video that captured great moments that wouldn't have been captured otherwise. The other members of the Perry's staff were wonderful as well. The hosts, servers, and bartenders were all super fast, professional, friendly, and accommodating. And, the cooks were fabulous too; many guests told us that it was the best wedding food they had every had. A big thanks and applause to Perry's!!!",

When I asked for a replacement or refund, the GM and waitress had an attitude and said no to the refund and that they could get me a cheaper Sushi replacement.

We had a really tasty dinner - great cocktails and delicious sushi. The service was admittedly a little slow, but our server was wonderful and so kind and helpful. And as he brought the check to us (and apologized for the service, which really wasn't worth apologizing for), he brought us three complimentary glasses of champagne! It was a lovely touch on a great meal, in a beautiful setting (up on the roof). My one ask would be to turn the music down just a touch. It's fine at the bar but is a little obtrusive at 8 or 9, at a weeknight dinner on the roof.  All in all - bravo, Perry's. Lovely dining experience.",

This was one of my favorite restaurants in the DC area 5-6 years ago and it's declined in quality and service, particularly in the last year.  Staff now wear jeans and flannel, which feels misplaced at an establishment that's often attended for special occasions and date nights. Had a couple of confusing experiences with apparent team serving at the sushi bar, not sure if I was actually being attended to by more than one server or if staff just didn't know who was serving me. Drinks are inconsistent, even ordering the same cocktail twice during dinner can yield two different beverages. During a recent meal on the roof, service was very slow (30+ mins for sushi, and everything came out at once - seaweed salad and crudo appeared with the sushi and rolls we'd expected later in the meal). Prices have increased seemingly without reason; on multiple visits have had some items that were \"fishier\" than is desirable.  Some gems remain; standout menu items include the hangar steak skewers,  hamachi crudo, element roll, and the hamachi collar if it's on offer. The rooftop continues to be one to beat - you can't make reservations specifically for the roof, but come early and with luck you'll be able to sit down and enjoy one of the most romantic locations in Adams Morgan. Here's hoping Perry's can turn things around and reclaim its high ranking on my list of favorites!",

We were struggling finding a nice, good restaurant to have our wedding, reception and ceremony until we found Perry. Not only they were permitting us to have our wedding there, the manager Sarah said she can help us decorating with the wedding decorations, put music. No restaurant wanted to help us, just wanted to give the place for wedding, give food and that's it. On Perry not only they were providing the place and food but also the manager was helping me and my husband like a wedding coordinator, that's amazing!! She is so nice, she decorated our wedding with our decorations, we only had to worry to show up and that's it and she will do the rest. Sarah and everybody was so nice and helpful and profesional in our wedding. She put our dream song Final Fantasy song for our ceremony, it was beautiful. The emplyees helped me too during tbe ceremony, they were all super nice and very helpful. We met owner of the place too, very nice man. Sarah and everybody made our dream wedding come true. I am so happy and lucky me and my husband found a great, beautiful place for our wedding. We LOVE the food there, the steak, chicken, desserts especially the green tea tiramisu are super delicious!! You gotta try it out!! It was the perfect wedding, our decorations next to thier chirstmas decorations, it looked so pretty, like a dreamland or a fairy tale. Thank you everybody on Perrys Restaurant!! Perry Restaurant is a marvelous restaurant, with happy employees, cozy environment like being in a happy home, I highly recommend it to go eat, have a good time or have your wedding!!

Had a lot of jokes and a lot of recommendations on what she should try, if we wanted to try something new.  I had been to Perry's a few times but I brought a few friends with me from out of town who have never been to this establishment.  He was very helpful and they all enjoyed their dish.  The atmosphere was good also.  I especially loved the meat, it was just right.  It was tender & juicy.  The sushi was alright, being as i'm not a sushi guy I can't say if it's excellent or not but it was definitely good. I will definitely be back to this restaurant hopefully sooner rather than later. I definitely recommend this spot to everyone, put it on your list of places to eat at if you're in the DMV.",
