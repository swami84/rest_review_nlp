Waitress disappeared for long durations and never asked if we needed anything. Manager was essentially our server.",

Only outdoor seating was open so it wasn\u2019t too busy. The food did not at all live up to what I had the first time. The appetizers weren\u2019t anywhere near as flavorful as they were the first time. My duck was served raw, no where close to medium rare. Green curry was rather flavorless. The service was not great, took 20 minutes to get our waiter multiple times. The maximum stay was 2 hours and we ended up being there for 3 hours...waiting over half the time. For the price it was not worth it. Hopefully the quality has improved.",

When the manager came out and we explained what happened, she didn't seem to be bothered.  I told her that she just lost 6 adults business and she said, \"I will speak with him and see what his side was.\"  We left and we will be informing everyone not to waste their time at an establishment that doesn't care about how they speak to and treat their customers.

We were eagerly anticipating dining  in this establishment after the glowing  reviews from reputable food critics/periodicals and even the esteemed Michelin guide no less! Our experience though mirrored though the same sentiments of dismal service as voiced out  by multiple diners. The critics either live in a parallel universe or had preferential service as evidenced by their glowing reviews.  PROS: food B+- pork belly was succulent and tasty lump crab with green curry was bracingly spicy the whole branzino was tangy and tasty --food prices were reasonable for the area  nice location- cavernous tastefully decorated, rustic with Asian accents  CONS: food: - the wings were extra crispy but tasted like cardboard with a side of bland ketchup - the chicken inasal was tough and dry ( ordered 2 but only 1 arrived but charged us for 2!!) - the ribeye was unseasoned and parts of it were raw ( had to be returned and replaced)..they did not bother to ask for our temperature preference - 2 lumpia- crispy but the vinegar sauce was not appropriate for the meat filling ( arrived after the main course...in time for dessert) - plain rice --served in cardboard paper bowls? - garlic rice- bland..garlic sprinkled after it was fried?  dessert: authentic Asian?--chocolate chip cookie and ice cream!  Service: Dismal and pitiful.. - they sat 3 of us in a 6 person table - 20 mins. before our server even came to us ( I had to flag someone else down) - table was still filthy  when we were seated( food scraps with water stains from previous customer)..the apologetic server cleaned it up upon our request! - we asked for a spoon 3x from 3 different servers..never arrived - 2 drinks ordered at the same time ( glass of wine ) arrived 10 mins. apart -overall: service was slow, uncoordinated, inattentive and non existent except for everyones apologies for being understaffed..  THE KICKER: The chef and owner? was actually seated close to us dining outside with VIP guests and oblivious to the surrounding chaos? If he could not notice his crew scampering around like cockroaches in daylight then he should just open a food truck. The table next ours complaining of poor/slow service  ,the lines in the unattended entry way building up ..which was actually next to his table. Thats because the host had to pitch in , bus tables and serve dishes leaving disgruntled potential guest  outside to leave for other establishments. The chef being the captain of this slow sinking ship should re learn business management 101 to somehow make Kaliwa ( meaning left in Filipino) make a U-turn to  back to respectability.",

Before we had someone approach us we waited about 15-20 minutes and saw as they ever so slowly attended to the nearby tables. I emphasize on slowly, we literally just ordered all at once to get a start on the entrees. And then, to put the cherry on top we waited an additional 15-20 minutes at the end of our meal to leave the restaurant. Covid-19 is not an excuse for how poor their service was. I visited once before the pandemic and this will probably be my last time dining here.",

I went for DC restaurant week and even though we kept seeing three or four servers checking up on Other tables we basically had to BEG for our entrees and had to wait 25 minutes for our dessert which was just one scoop of tea ice cream that we didn\u2019t even like. They say that it has a 90 minute limit per table but we waited another 20 minutes just for them to bring us the bill which we had to go ask them for. To top it all off they have a 20% tip embedded in the bill which is a COLOSSAL ripe off since they have such terrible service. Our waiter walked off in the middle of us ordering and there was a different person who came and dealt with every part of the ordering and food delivery process. They also cooked our meat without asking how we wanted it and one waiter was nice enough to replace it as gave us it in a to-go box as we were done eating. However, we left the restaurant and walked a few shops down to realise we had left the box of completely untouched meat at our table. On going back one waitress named Tamara, who had looked at us and ignored our table all night as we searched for people to bring us our food and bill, told us they threw it away and it\u2019s our fault she can\u2019t help us. I understand with the virus going on the health code guidelines ask for food to be thrown out but Tamara was very rude and unsympathetic in trying to help the customers that just spend over $200 at this joke of a Filipino restaurant. 0/10 recommend. If you are planning to go here you have a better chance of receiving better food and service at a McDonald\u2019s.",

I ordered the Red Curry with Blue Crab and Crispy Garlic, Panang Curry, and a side of fries. I know, fries is a weird addition but I love fries, it was on the menu so I just went with it.  I ordered for pickup and the food was all packed in cardboard containers. I still can't figure out if these are recyclable or not. They are lined with wax or plastic. I use picking up food as a nice excuse to get out and walk to other neighborhoods so my walk home was about 25 min. The containers held up! No leaks!  The dishes, when I got home, were very unattractive. I'm adding photos but they really don't do them any justice. Don't worry, because the flavors are incredible!  The Red Curry with Blue Crab is phenomenal. You get so much crab! It's the type of dish I didn't want to end so I just ate small portions to savor the taste.  The Panang Curry was not what I expected. This is usually my favorite Thai dish, but Kaliwa's take is more of a savory curry with charred pork belly, onions, and whole peanuts. I prefer a panang curry that is creamier, sweeter, with tofu or chicken, chopped peanuts, and broccoli or carrots. It still tasted great, just not what I was hoping for.  Now, the fries... I have no idea why I got fries but the serving is huge and I really enjoyed them with my curry!",

The lumpia was good but for $15 dollars for 3 long pieces is truly a rip off and an outcry for all Filipinos all over the world. My wife and I also ordered two cocktails which were extremely alcoholic (which is great if you wanna get drunk) but as a mixologist I was very disappointed. The redeeming quality of this restaurant is that the wait staff is very kind and accommodating.",

Three lumpias (about 6 to 8 inches long, 1/2\" diameter), and 2 white rice came first. Then the 2 pcs of BBQ, followed by the pancit.  I love Filipino food, and all i can say is--  i had better.  Our waiter was ok.  The place is clean and the ambiance is nice. 4 bathrooms with single stalls in each. Clean but the one I was in run out of soap and the floor was wet.  3 dishes 1 soda, our bill came to $62.  If this review helped you in any way, please give it a thumbs up.  Bon appetit!",

I didn't perceive this to be the case in either visit, but if this does happen to you, this is a very service-oriented restaurant, and the waiters would happily take the plate back and have it re-prepared. I'd pass on the pork hash, which although creative, was excessively fatty. The service we experienced in the winter was far superior to the service in the summer. I highly recommend stopping by.",

        "caption": "Well... I wasn't going to write a review but I have never had such high expecttions for a place be ruined by unnecesary hassle and illegal activity. Don't get me wrong, the food I had at this place was very good but it seemed just about everything about the service went wrong. I am writing this after calling the management to report that an extra $10 had been charged to my card without my authorization. Although it is over now and completely resolved this whole experience just rubbed me the wrong way and I want to warn others so they don't have to go through the same. I came in at 3 on a Friday afternoon. It was not busy at all. Our first server was very nice, attentive and answered our questions. My friend and I were just about ready to order when instead of our server coming another server came to take our order. Her service was average and she seemed to be doing the minimum. I ordered the oxtail and my friend ordered the pork belly with onions. The oxtail was flavourful and the rice porrige with it was nicely seasoned. The Korean pork belly was also flavourful and we ate all the food. The service was quick but as we finished the meal the server made she made a strage comment about us finishing the food. She acted surprised that we finished all the food and said that people didn't always like it. It seemed really weird to me and kind of unprofessional for her to bad mouth her own restaurant's food. I'm kind of an all or nothing person when it comes to tips and since I didn't really like how the restaurant switched our servers halfway through the meal or the service of the second sever I decided not to tip because I knew it would go to her. My friend decided to do the same. We walked out of the restaurant with a generally good experience and decided to enjoy the rest of our day at the Wharf. This is where it gets bad. Three days later a charge shows up on my statement. I was initially charged for the meal but that charge has now disappeared and has been replaced with a charge from Kaliwa for $10 more than my meal. I call them immediately they write down my info but it's New Years, they say they'll look into it and get back to me on the 2nd or 3rd. It's the 4th, no calls. I call them and I give them and tell the person I'm talking to that I've already voiced my issue and my info has already been recorded. He basically confirms that no one has looked into it at all. He takes care of it, finds my order and tells me that I was right, my meal was $10 less than what I was charged for and says he'll contact the accounting department and refund me the $10. Issue has been cleared up, this whole phone call took about 30 minutes. The guy I talked to was  but I still felt like I was being blamed a little too much for not leaving a tip. After all me not leaving a tip gives the server absolutely no right to illegally add $10 onto my bill. The employee I was on the phone with says the server switch might have been due to change of shifts but I knew that wasn't true because I saw my previous server waiting on other tables as I walked out the door. THIRTY MINUTES LATER I get a call from the employee again. He pronounces my name wrong. (He has read it multiple times at this point.) He askes me if I have checked my email yet for the message about the $10 refund. It has literally been 30 minutes. I do not check my email that often. I just want to move on, leave the past in the past and not go back to restaurants that try to scam me but I check my email, and confirm I got it. 8 DAYS LATER my mess with this restaurant is finally over. I don't have my refund yet but I really hope at least that will show up as it is supposed to. I'm just ready to be done dealing with this and I want future diners to know that if you want unauthorised charges on your credit card and want to worry about people stealing your money if you don't tip them, Kaliwa is the place to go! Because of the length of this review I didn't edit it so there may be a few grammar/spelling mistakes. Please excuse this.",

They said each serving is meant to be shared for 2-3 people, NOPE! Some of them is not even enough for 1 person. The garlic rice, is like dried congee with toasted garlic on top! Nope! not even close to how your suppose to make a regular garlic rice. Lumpiang shanghai is $5 EACH!!! my kids love lumpia but they weren't very happy when they tasted theirs. NEVER going back again. If you want a really good filipino food, we found this spot in springfield area MANILA ORIENTAL, now their food is authentic and very affordable., you won't regret going.",

We were incredibly hungry & excited to try something new.. our waiter explained the restaurant & said the idea of the menu is to be shared family style & range in size - so we each ordered an entree (4 total) with the intention to share - as family style generally refers to large food portions. To our shock, the portions were so small it wasn\u2019t even enough to satisfy 1 person. We kept asking for extra sides of rice because we were still so hungry. For $20 minimum a plate - You\u2019d expect a generous portion of food on that plate.. I ordered the Pancit - the overall flavors were good but my shrimp had a fishy taste & there was another meat present that was really flavorful but there wasn\u2019t much there. If you\u2019re hungry - don\u2019t eat here. Service was great so was the atmosphere - but the food to price ratio made no sense. They need to put more food on the plate or lower the price - and not tell people their menu is family style - very confusing disappointing dining experience",

However, the amount of food for the price here was highly disappointing.  We ordered the Crispy Shrimp and Pork Fried Rolls and for $15 we got basically three small fried rolls.  Pretty tasty, but I would not order that again.  Since we were just there for a quick bite, that is my only data point.  But based on other reviews here, I may be back to try something a little more substantial from the menu to see if it's worth it.  Thank you.  Update as of 04 Oct 19: This place is classy,  and took my previous review to heart and made it right.  Thank you so much for the personal attention, and look forward to the next visit!",

Every table gives you a clear view of the chefs working in the kitchen.  The menu offers a wide variety of delicious and mouth-watering starters followed by the main courses. I had the pleasure of eating more than one,but Braised Beef Cheeks (Kare Kare) was my favorite dish. They were all exquisite!  All the cuisines were fresh and refreshing. Chefs gave a home-made feeling using the best quality ingredients. The restaurant also offers various types of drinks, they serve one of the best selections of digestifs!

        "caption": "Overhyped.  Overpriced.  Our first time at Kaliwa so our group has been building anticipation and excitement until our actual reservation date.  The location was right smack in a very busy social hub so we understood all the distractions outside and inside...it really felt like a busy thoroughfare inside the restaurant.  There seemed to be too many servers coming and going the whole time we were there.  Unfortunately, having more than enough staff did not make the food arrive in good time.  Our birthday celebrant had to wait more than 30 minutes for his entr\u00e9e -- we were all done with our food and his was just getting delivered!  That was really bad.  And the Michelin-Bib-Gourmand-acknowledged menu really did look impressive...ON PAPER.  The actual servings (except for the flounder, at least it was a whole fish) left us totally dissatisfied and disenchanted.  When the sizzling Sisig arrived in a small skillet, we actually thought it was a mistake...that some other table ordered Sisig as an \"appetizer.\"  Realizing it was the entr\u00e9e one of us ordered floored us!  Then came the Bibimbap.  Sigh.  I (this reviewer) actually ordered it.  I've had Bibimbap before.  There was a full cup of rice underneath an egg done 'sunny side up,' with approximately a tablespoon each of bean sprouts, spinach, kimchi, and maybe two pieces of mushrooms and pickled cucumber.  I went ballistic internally!  I have made Bibimbap myself.  And elsewhere, Bibimbap would come served with some Bulgogi-type meat strips.  I didn't read the menu well enough to realize it didn't mention the inclusion of any meat.  Still...  Despite the missing ingredient, this bowl of Bibimbap was so bland on its own.  Believe me, I've had Bibimbap that proved tasteful even without the Gochujang (red bean paste)!  Sigh.  I could go to HMart (Korean grocery) and eat Bibimbap from their food court and be truly happy with the quality I'll get, nevermind the ambiance!  Tsk.  Tsk.  Tsk.  It got worse when the order for Foie Grass Dumplings (\"Pancit Molo\") was served to another person in our group.  Four little round dumplings with bits of spring onions and ginger(?) slices, and about a cup of tasteless broth...it just wasn't \"entr\u00e9e-worthy.\"  The other food we ordered were also so-so.  They might've been better than the aforementioned dishes, but they weren't what we expected.  Michelin or no Michelin, having to pay more than the usual for the same food that we could find in other (under-hyped) restaurants really hurt our feelings.  We would've loved to lift up Kaliwa and put it on a culinary pedestal...but, sadly...  To anyone who's gotten this far in this review, may I suggest that you try (if you haven't yet) PURPLE PATCH's Sizzling Sisig.  (Their portion is good enough for two, and there's not a lot of fat in the meat.) Find out why our group was suddenly disenchanted with Kaliwa.  Purple Patch is in the Mt. Pleasant area, it's another restaurant that offers modernized Filipino dishes.  Location may generate some fancy hype, but really good, tasteful food (especially those served generously) is what makes customers return (repeatedly).  Lastly...the biggest disappointment for our group...\"we took it (Halo-Halo) off our menu.\"  Why, oh why???  Kaliwa's current desserts weren't even uniquely special.  We honestly all said that we wouldn't be going back to Kaliwa (unless somebody else were paying for their pricey meal...LOL).",

Our waitresses were very friendly and overall the service was great with a chic ambiance - people dressed pretty fancy to kind of casual (no sneakers) and I liked the decor which was kind of different from other Asian fusion restaurants I've been to.  To start, we ordered a Pok Pok drink, and for appetizers we had the Filipino bbq skewers which were packed with flavour and super tender! Definitely had to eat these extra slow to enjoy them longer lol.  For entrees, we ordered the kare kare (Filipino peanut dish - really good) and wow it was to die for! Soooo good - just as good as my Mother makes it, and also a bibimbap which was also pretty decent and I liked how it had a lot of veggies. We didn't order any desserts since we were so full already but from what I remember they all sounded delicious!",

Food was tasty and the portions on the large side for small plates. For appetizers we had the Filiplno Street BBQ Skewers made from pork belly and the Korean Raw Yellow Fin Tuna served with avocado and a Korean hot pepper paste (but only just enough to give a tang to the raw fish). For the main dish we enjoyed the Filipino Pork Belly with fried egg (which was barely runny) and the Thai Wood Grilled Half Chicken (tasty but from a rather large chicken). For dessert, the sponge cake was wrapped jelly roll style about a deep purple custardy filling that we found out to be yam. This sat in a coconut rum sauce garnished with cashews. It looked lovely but tasted quite bland. In spite of the place being not at all crowded, it still took more than an hour and a half to get served 3 items.An interesting place to visit with good food beautifully presented but not inspired.",

After spending several hundred $$ having dinner inside, we asked to order a drink at a table on the patio to listen to live music on the boardwalk. Was told by both hostess and manager that patio is reserved only for serving full meals and ordering drinks with meals and even though we had just had full meals and drinks inside, we could only be served on patio if we ordered full meals. This was Sun, Aug 18 at 6 pm; it was 91 degrees out and NO ONE ELSE, nada, zero was on the patio at the time. It was also nearly empty inside. While I was inquiring inside, my family was sitting on the patio and a waiter came and asked for their drink orders. He came back about 10 minutes later and replied, \"While I would love to serve you, my manager will not let me as he tells me this area is reserved for full diners only.\"  So, we sat there and listened to the band for a half hour, Kaliwa missed out on ~$100 bar tab, and NO ONE, nada, zero came to the patio the entire time in the 91 degree heat.

Of all the 6 dishes we tried, thai green curry is the only food we can say is ok. Overall experienced,  is very bad, service is ok, but can do much better.

Both were awesome, but the Korean one was better. Then the Filipino fried roll with pork came out. Then the pork belly came...YUM. then that crab curry...Heavenly. It was one of the best things I\u2019ve tasted in DC.  Then when the tasting menu couldn\u2019t get any better, they ended the course with a Thai ribeye. Knocked it out of the park. Marinated in fish sauce. If you love Thai food, you\u2019ll love it.  The drinks were great. I\u2019m a recent convert to mai tais, and they have a delicious frozen mai tai on the menu. Get it.  Can\u2019t say enough good things about Kaliwa. The service was attentive and prompt. Yeah it\u2019s expensive, but the food merits the price, and the location is great. It doesn\u2019t disappoint, and we\u2019ll be back.",

The longer we stayed, the more disgruntled he seemingly became.  I ordered the street barbeque skewers...that did not have skewers nor was there any meat on the small fatty pork squares.  The server did not bring a knife to cut the gelatinous objects, and the small portions of meat hidden between the layers of fat were tasteless.

Each cuisine is limited to I think what is best on their respective origins but they have limited selections on their menu which I think is good as customers are faced with 3 different cuisines and might be overwhelmed by it.  Parking - this is the wharf ao parking can be a challenge and expensive too.  Ambiance - i can barely tell that this is an asian restaurant. The interiors are like mashups of modern and european touch and trying hard to infuse an asian ambiance.  The chandeliers can be easily mistaken as those tiny sea shells but it turns out it is a wooden balls.  Cozy? Maybe on the yes side.  Noise level is too high, i can hear people talking loudly because they need as the sounds coming from the sound system plus other people talking.  Food  Kinilaw - All Filipinos love Kinilaw. Each province in the Philippines have different variations but one thing should be in common, vinegary-taste with strong hint of giner and lime and i think even the inexperienced or aspiring Filipino cook would\u2019ve gotten this easily but ssdly, Kaliwa didn\u2019t get this.  Kare-kare  At first glance, it looks pale compared to outlr usual kare-kare. Maybe because of the peanut that they use for the sauce.  The sauce in the kare-kare is creamy. I like the creaminess of the sauce but there is something missing  that i acn\u2019t put my finger on it but i like it in general. Tip: ask them to grind the peanuts that they put as a topping it will be more infuse more flavor to the sauce.  All in all, their take on one of the greatest Filipino dish is a little apot on. The portion is enough for one serving.  The beef perfectly blends with the sauce and vegetables.  Price wise, comparing the ratio serving vs the price, it\u2019s expensive for me.",

I enjoy the Wharf area, and have visited it a number of times, but for some reason I hadn't ever come across this particular restaurant.  When I visited it was for a late dinner on a weeknight (Wednesday), and my date and I were able to be seated quickly even without a reservation which was nice.  The decor in the space is very appealing, and our servers were polite and checked in on us often, even though it was pretty busy.  Most importantly, the food was delicious! I ordered three dishes and my date ordered two, which was plenty, and I especially enjoyed the Panang Curry. It was phenomenal! The Bibimbap was excellent as well.  Lastly, to touch on something others have mentioned, it is a bit expensive, however so are the majority of the restaurants at the wharf; just keep in mind when you're perusing the menu that you'll likely want to order two or three dishes.  I'll definitely visit again! If you're on the fence, you won't regret giving it a shot.",

Nikki, the general manager, was wonderful to work with, and was very responsive & collaborative for the event planning. We had a private space up on the mezzanine level and were served buffet style, which worked out well. The one hiccup that occurred was encountering several additional guests arriving unannounced, but it was not a problem b/c the chef and Nikki were able to seamlessly provide more tasty food and servers on very short notice to\u200b meet our needs.  The food has great flavor with wonderful vegetarian options.  There's a nice selection of beer, wine, and unique cocktails.  Kaliwa's staff helped make the evening a great success! I highly recommend Kaliwa for anyone planning to host a social event at the District Wharf.",

Cocktail menu was certainly interesting and I went with the Lasing (soju & lychee) which did not disappoint! Short ribs were melt in your mouth deliciousness I would definitely order over and over again. We also opted for the lamb stew and Bibimbap, they were nothing special but the remaining dishes more than made up for it. Deducted a star as the hostess neglected to mention the birthday to our server and we did not get a birthday special of any sort. But will definitely go back for the food nonetheless!",

But all of it is good quality and worth trying - lots of colors and textures and flavors, but nothing obnoxiously over-the-top. While we thought the Korean-style seafood medley on egg noodles was unremarkable, the blue crab curry was wonderful, with generous chunks of meat and just the right amount of heat. It's a bit pricey, but we enjoyed being thrown for a loop here.",

The atmosphere is clean but not sterile, it maintains a homey and vibrant feel while being immaculately clean. The layout is open and has a lovely 2nd level. I was able to peek up at the screens at the bar between conversation to see who was winning the UFC fights, which I was ecstatic to find they were showing.  I did not order my own food, as this was a planned event, however, I tried every single item and absolutely loved it. I'm a huge fan of seafood and meat and the selections I got to choose from were exquisite. I'm not big on fish but the rockfish they served had me coming back for more. I never waited long for anything at the bar or my table, even though, the place was packed with my coworkers. My glass was always full and so was my stomach by the end. All of the staff were professional and helpful. My wife and I were so impressed that, even though we live over an hour away, will definitely be coming back. We are also recommending Kaliwa to all of our friends and family. What a gem of a place. Thanks, Kaliwa and Muki for making it a such a pleasant and memorable evening.",

I decided to visit Kaliwa after being with Cathal at a Walter Reed benefit for the veterans.  I explained the fare and that we would simply leave it in the capable hands of Cathal and Meshelle.  Interesting concept as we normally go to  a steak or seafood (American style) restaurant.  Loved the decor and warm welcome when we entered (first timers).  We were seated with a view of the open kitchen and main floor.  Courtney our server was fantastic and although not familiar with most of the menu, explained the 4 course menu with great clarity.  We ordered drinks and sat looking at the menu with much discussion.  When she came back and we informed her we were going with the 4 courses, she said simply relax, sit back and enjoy as Chef would create the dining experience.  The short version is that it was the most fantastic selection, pairing and assortment of flavors, spices and seafood/meats my friends had experienced in the Greater Washington DC area.  So much so that Stewart began photo bombing and posting during the entire meal.  I could go on and on but the fact of the matter is, it is now a must see and must experience \"go to\" restaurant for his family and friends.  Congratulations on all points.  My sincere thanks to all of the staff, front and back of house.  Excellence in motion for sure.  Well done Cathal and Meshelle. Tom and Denise Burke",

Immediately after sitting down at the restaurant, the waitress was dismissive when I asked if there was a menu or any markings for items on the menu that were gluten free. She basically said I had about 3 options and that the kitchen would not modify anything to accommodate my allergy. Then I was told that if that was not ok I should just try a different restaurant. So I got up and left. While I do not expect any establishment to bend over backwards for an allergy I was bothered by how much of an inconvenience I seemed. There was nothing on the website to suggest that the options for me would be limited. As a side note, the Irish pub across the walkway was wonderful and had a plethora of options for those with dietary restrictions.",
