The second time however was by far one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. The wait staff from the point of seating my party of four was rude, inattentive (the restaurant is still at 25% capacity), and continually got our orders wrong. Now I wouldn't have been so upset if I had not observed the wait staff attending to the other patrons with far better service. It seemed as if we were only getting bad service, I am not sure what kind of business they are trying to run but they should give everyone great service no matter what.",

It took a very long time for the waiter to come take drink orders. It was suggested that our table it a full bottle of champagne and pitchers of juice since it was so many getting the bottomless drinks. The first bottle came out, the waiter opened it and poured the first drinks. The pitchers of juice were so small for it to be for a table of 5. We had to keep asking for juice which took forever to get each time. We FINALLY got to order food. The food was good even though we waited pretty long for it. We had to flag down our waiter to get more drinks. The next few bottles of champagne we had to open ourselves. After I finished I was still hungry so I ordered some fries. I NEVER GOT THEM. At this point its getting a little busy. We started noticing that our waiter was hanging out at a few tables for longer periods of time, causing us to have to get up and fund ppl to serve us. Dont want to make it about race but he definitely was giving his best service to his white customers. Anyway,  we sat for about 25mins and noone came to our table. My mom finally got up and went inside to get someone. Our waiter finally came to the table and we asked gor our checks.  Thook another 15mins to get it. When the check came i realized the fried were on the bill. I told my waiter I never got them. He snatched my bill tray from me with a little attitude. The inside of the restuarant stinks and smelled like old water under a mat. Maybe something was spilled and not cleaned up properly. Unfortunately, we will not be back. Im not sure how they got 4.3 stars.",

They took their time bringing water. They took their time bringing drinks and my mimosa was warm. The food took forever, too, and it was cold. We were eating with people we'd just met, so I didn't want to make a scene. Otherwise, I'd have sent my cold potatoes and omelet back. We also ordered a well done burger to go.

We called here to see if they had room for ten and miraculously they did! I literally never write reviews but wanted to because in the end we all, including the birthday boy, were so glad we ended up here! Everything was great from the food and the mimosa options even down to the playlist. Everyone honestly cleaned their plates lol. The service was also excellent and everyone was extremely friendly. We truly had a great time and already planned another brunch here for another friend\u2019s birthday next month. I also want to make it back for dinner :)",

Shannon helped coordinate the event with me weeks before, even though she was about to go into labor! We were able to agree on a very fair, customized deal in terms of pricing per person and menu options. The service itself was wonderful. The two waiters who served our group were attentive and checked on us often. The food was also great, and considering that we 30 brunch entrees ordered at once, the kitchen did a great job of getting the food out on time and I can say the quality did not suffer. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone, and will definitely be coming up.",

When I originally made the reservation, I expected around 25 people, but had to revise as 29 people in the week before the dinner. Brick Lane easily rolled with the change, and set us up for the entire top floor. They worked with us to provide drink deals, menu options, birthday shots, flexible time frame, split checks, and table setup. Everyone at my party was impressed with the rustic but luxe atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious food! I received so many compliments on choosing the venue, since the food was 10/10 even though we had so many people. The service was speedy and they were even able to split checks for everyone, which I did not expect!  Specifically about the food - I love lamb dishes and my boyfriend loves steak, but we also had some vegetarians. Everyone loved their dishes and overall, it was a great experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a group dinner, or even just with a friend! You really can't go wrong. Everyone working at Brick Lane cares about providing the best experience.",

I had many. My friends had the burger which they raved about and I had the salmon dinner salad which came with a really impressive piece of salmon and an equally impressive presentation/salad. I happily ate every bite. Our waiter was fantastic and while I was waiting for the bathroom the manager introduced himself to me as well. Additionally, another person (the owner perhaps?) came to our table on two occasions to ensure our food was good and we were satisfied. What phenomenal customer service! We all finished with the chocolate lava cake and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and both were beyond excellent. If I find myself back in DC I wouldn't hesitate to return to this place. There were a number of other options on the menu I'd love to try! Don't walk, run to Brick lane!",

They sat table after table and no one came to take orders. At least one table next to us got up and left after sitting for 30 minutes with no server. We finally ordered with the host after I went in and asked him. They didn't bring the coffee we asked for or one of the sides we ordered. We never got a real server and felt lucky to get our food at all.",

For a newly opened restaurant to have chipped plates and badly painted chairs and tables, they are either used or badly handle. Except the salads, the three dishes we ordered were either semi cooked earlier or made of low quality ingredients. The fruits and vegetables used for garnishing were clearly old and the taste was less than okay. The sausages tasted like they were cooked a couple of days earlier. We ordered a couple of deserts. The chocolate lava cake was okay but a bit sweeter than it should be, but the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was old and dry pudding with freshly burned sugar.  What a disappointment!",

The service was incredible and the food rivaled the service. I got a vegetarian tofu dish that was absolutely delicious (and huge). My boyfriend got the Hanger Steak which was amazing (the highlight was the wasabi mashed potatoes) and well worth the cost. Secretly, we were both going to the restaurant because we saw lava cake on the menu and couldn't resist. We got two. Zero regrets, it was great. I highly recommend due to good food and good service.
