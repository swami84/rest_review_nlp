This is why, as much as I would love to support the chain, it feels like such a gamble to have a meal from here. Each fond memory keeps getting replaced by a horrific experience. I'd rather hold on to good memories than risk ruining my perception of the restaurant.",

I ask her if they could cook me somee fresh chicken. She asked another employee ( in  tagalog) and told me yes. I thanked her and paid. I waited about 5 mins and they fixed the sides. Then the cook proceeded to take the chicken sitting on the heater and dumped it back in the fryer. I say excuse me miss I thought you said that they could cook me somei fresh chicken. She was like they told me it wasn't out long. I was so disappointed . I just wanted to try the place. She offered me a refund  I thanked her and left.

All of it was delicious in different ways. The spaghetti is no where near traditional, but that's what makes it so charming. The surprisingly sweet sauce with chopped hot dogs in it (yes, hot dogs)  reminded me of Campbell's Spaghetti-o with franks. Take with that what you will. The fried chicken was crispy, juicy, and flavorful. A little on the salty side, but not egregiously so. The mashed potatos were good; simple and filling.  Combine that with friendly staff, free wifi (I had to ask for the password though), and clean environment, this is an excellent restaurant.  I would come back here, and I'd recommend anyone to come here too.",

They were all delicious but my favorite was the palabok and my husband said the fried chicken was the best he's had. Super crunchy and juicy.  It was everything you want fried Chicken to be. The yum burger, super simple but super yummy.  Their version of the Big Mac. I'll admit the Halo Halo threw me off, beans, flan and ice cream...not sure I can get behind that. The ice cream on its own was great though. Overall very happy we tried it!",

We arrived just before the busy lunchtime rush, and ordered a variety of different meals ranging from chickenjoy (seasoned fried chicken) the Amazing Aloha (2 patties, bacon, honey mustard), and spaghetti.  The Aloha burger was on-point, and the chicken was irresistibly crispy and full of flavor.  The service was genuinely friendly as we were greeted with smiles and patience as we placed our long order. I must reiterate\u2014the food tasted as good if not better than the Philippine locations!  They make an extra effort to keep this location spotless and clean, as we saw tables continually/thoroughly sanitized throughout our long stay (proximity to grocery Seafood Market)  Accessibility is also easy, as the parking is shared with Seafood City (actual parking lot) so no need to parallel park in an urban neighborhood. After your meal, you head straight to shopping, which is also a plus if you have lots of guests. I assume that most patrons do just that\u2014make it a dining and shopping 1-2 combo.  Overall, I will be returning! Kudos to this location for making our stay happy!",

You could have told me before I got in line and wasted time.  Is this place a fast food restaurant or a sit down?!?  One hour to get fast food is just plain old mismanagement. If u can't handle big orders then DON'T take them.  They were still not telling the people waiting in line to order about the wait, so we did. Fix it!",

Prices are reasonable & selection very good.  However, keep in mind this is food Filipino style!  Be prepared for a surprising difference in flavors! Love the spaghetti best but like all that I've tried.  Would go much more often, but closest one is located about 150 miles away. I highly recommend you try this place & foods!  Kids especially like many dishes! Wish one would open here in the Indianapolis area!  Would probably be a weekly visit thing!  Find one!  Enjoy!  Still no place like this close to Indy.  Wish there was.  Would expect it to be very busy all the time, but would still go.  Some foods could be found elsewhere, but this place prepares & cook such differently. One reason why popular, especially to the Asian &  Filipino community.  If ever near one...highly recommend you try!  Kids love the food too!  Prices not super cheap, but still not bad.  Competative with other fast food places, but this is more of a sit down place, than a taje out.",

We knew there was a Jollibee, and it wasn't far away, or so we thought.  Traffic was pretty rough to get here, going 20 miles in 55 minutes.  We arrived ravenous.  In a fit of starvation, we basically ordered one of everything on the menu.  Here are my thoughts from an entirely Caucasian perspective:  The hot dog comes with cheese, ketchup, and mayo on it. It's  very creamy and savory, and I dont think I could eat more than one.  The hamburger steak was pretty much what you would expect, a Salisbury steak in gravy with a side.  For people not familiar with Filipino food, their spaghetti has sugar and hot dogs in it.  It's good, but it's really sweet.  To my favorite part: Chicken Joy.  Get it.  Get a lot.  It's crispy and seasoned perfectly.  It's my favorite fast food chicken and it's over 700 miles away.  If one were in my area I would go pretty regularly.  All in all, I would like to visit here again, given the opportunity. Give it a try and see for yourself.",
