By the time my salad dressing was added it was much less. I asked to put more \u201clettuce\u201d- \u201clettuce\u201d in my bowl and the Server stated that she could not. I asked to speak with the manager and she said it is now their  policy to serve less for the same price! WTW the manger Jessica wasn\u2019t helpful at all. She stated that it\u2019s the company policy and oh well if \u2018you\u2019 don\u2019t like it! WTW NEVER GOING BACK and I plan to let my colleagues know to go other places for lunch! Very disappointed!! Doesn\u2019t deserve a STAR. In addition the stations were very messy. I had to ask them to clean around it before something  fell in my bowl.",
