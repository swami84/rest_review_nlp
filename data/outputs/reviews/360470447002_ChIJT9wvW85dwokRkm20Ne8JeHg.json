We left, went to another spot (Venezuela Street Food) a block away and ordered fries. We then return, ordered wings and sat outside snacking on our food waiting on the wings which we were told will be ready in 15 minutes. I watched the owner saw us then go tell one of the employees to take us off the table because we are promoting other people\u2019s businesses. The guy who was really nice by the way apologized and said it's not him it's the owner. We asked for a refund. We are supposed to be supporting small businesses which we did by purchasing for three different spots in the area. But this owner greed will be the downfall of this business. I feel bad for the employees that have to work for him because they were all really nice. Anyway with that being said, We live right up the block and will not recommend this spot to any of my family or friends. We will continue to support the other small bars and restaurants nearby.",
