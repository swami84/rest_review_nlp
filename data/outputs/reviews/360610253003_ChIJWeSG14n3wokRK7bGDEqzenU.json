I\u2019ve been ordering delivery and picking up takeout from this spot since they first opened.  1) The woman (I wish I knew her name) who runs the place is SO kind and friendly! 2) The restaurant is sparkly clean. 3) The food is fantastic.  I\u2019ve never had a bad or \u201coff\u201d experience here. The quality has been very consistent. I usually order pho and as a non-vegetarian, I have to say that the tofu pho is surprised my favorite.
