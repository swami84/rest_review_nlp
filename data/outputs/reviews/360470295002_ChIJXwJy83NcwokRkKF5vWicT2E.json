I specifically requested and paid for extra basmati rice.  No rice in bag when arrived home. Called the establishment to let them know. The  individual who answered said come get it and I said \"No.. I'm just letting you know because \"..... Just before i could finish he hurriedly said \"im not sending someone out for $4 AND hung up. I was about to say because about 10-12 guests are willing to try you so please dont get their orders wrong.  Needless to say after he hung up I directed my guests to the other Indian Restaurant 2 blocks over.  I know its raining but it probably worth the walk unless you check all your orders before you leave the establishment. I wonder how long they will last....",

The flavor was excellent and pretty authentic - as an Indian I was very pleased. Great value for money because portions are pretty large. Don't expect to be spoilt by lavish service - but they're polite and efficient. Food didn't take long to arrive and service was prompt. I took a friend there, who wasn't well acquainted with Indian food, and had always hesitated from trying it. He loved the food and was very grateful that we ended up there on a whim. A pleasant first experience for him. I would definitely recommend the place.",
