I love the flavor of the hot sauce (supposed to Nashville hot chicken style?) , but fair warning that it can be very spicy. The chicken sandwich is still big as ever and the hot sauce is fire. The chicken and sandiches are worth the prices (~$8-$13). They also expanded their menu to onclude more combos and other sides.

Considering I have tried numerous Chicken joints all over the city, including suburbs. After a couple weeks of reading the reviews and talking about it with my co worker, we decided to order it for pick up.  We ordered the big boss spicy chicken sandwich (medium heat) and an order of Curly Fries.  As I arrived there were at least 4 people waiting on their order, I had placed it over the phone. After they said 10 minutes, I took at least 15 min to make sure it was ready once I arrived. When I got there, I couldn't find any parking as it was on a busy street and had very limited parking space. I ended up parking across where there was a gas station. When I arrived I had to wait another 6 min as they were behind. Order ended up taking at least 20 minutes.  First good thing: The fries were crispy and pretty tasty. I almost finished the box of fries (pretty big- could be shared) before I even took a bite of the sandwich. Let down: The chicken sandwich did not live up to the expectations. Wasn't crispy enough although it was fried, the sauce was tasty but not as spicy as some reviews mentioned the medium sauce to be. The chicken did not seem the best quality, I dislike the brown spots and slim/skin in between bites. I cut it in half to try to finish it but only ate half, but not because it was amazing.  Although I support all business, I'm not 100% I would go back to try the other Items.",

When we walked in, it was empty, but a woman was at the counter. She took our orders, and then she disappeared until it was ready. My first bite was great! I thought it was gonna all be great. The piece of chicken was huge, so my first bite was just the edge of the chicken. As I got to the sandwiches part, i realized the slaw was too oniony for me and I eventually removed the slaw. My partner got to the center and said he couldn't go on, because it started to taste and smell fishy. I thought nothing of it until I got to the center of mine, and mine also tasted fishy, so I pulled the chicken apart and the center was a big fatty pocket that wreaked like fish! I couldn't eat anymore either. I was grossed out by it in the end. I don't know if the fryer isn't being cleaned or changed like it should or if the oil was bad or the chicken was old, but since it wasn't just mine and a few other reviewers mention it too, I wouldn't recommend it.",

You could go all the way up to the Big Boss Hot x3 if you want to do that to yourself. The servers are very welcoming and amicable and space usually isn't an issue on weekends.

The atmosphere felt cheap, miss matched eating utensils,  styrofoam plates and chairs at the window that felt like they were from IKEA . My chair wobbled so much I felt it was going to brake while eating. I had high hopes for this place but will not be returning. There are better options for fried chicken in the city.",

I shared the fries (combo of waffle and curly) which was fine as a side to the sandwich. Was not a huge fan of the Mac and cheese, it was soggy and overpriced and wasn't anything special. I deducted a star bc the bathroom could be cleaner and they use styrofoam for serveware which is not eco-friendly.",

I waited for a while before someone helped us at the counter. The lady was rude. Non apologetic for having us wait for such a long time, begins with, \"What do you want to order?\". Ok. I ordered the 1 of the 2 spicy lunchbox. Btw, they don't serve free water, you'd have to purchase a bottle. Sat down, waited for 20 mins. Not too long after I sat, a couple of customer waited by the counter. The whole time, the lady was never to be seen. Until, of course, 20 mins later, she comes out with our food and then rudely took the 2 customers order. No apologies, again. I mean, c'mon, what is up with the service here? Does she work in the front and the back? Anyways, the food was bland. Spicy, though. Too bad that's all it was. I don't believe I will go back to even try the fried chicken. Maybe delivery would've been better because then you won't have to witness how bad the service was.",

Let me tell you just enough heat for me. I don't think I could've gone hotter. Every bite was crunchy until the end. The combination of heat with creamy crunchy coleslaw was the most amazing combination I have ever tasted. I am so coming here again I want to be hungry again RIGHT NOW to have another sandwich. $8 is a great price for this delight.  The Mac-n-Cheese was a great addition.  Creamy cheesy with what looked like a touch of pepper was the coup de gras!  All I can say is come try it for yourself.  If you have an open mind for flavor you will love this place. Not much to look at as a restaurant but who cares, you come to eat, not relax! Eat away,  thank me later! They didn't get 5 stars because they want you to BUY water instead of just giving you a cup of water. I certainly didn'tike that.",

Lots of graffiti, and a huge chicken art. Not what one typically thinks for the Asian-styled chicken my friend raved about.  Inside it is extremely clean. 5/5 passes the \u201cwould I take my Asian mom there\u201d  We got two chicken sandwiches and a half chicken: mild, medium and hot.  The chicken sandwiches were really good! Fresh chicken, fully seasoned, with coleslaw that pairs well. It maintains its juiciness while keeping the breading crisp. If anything, it might be almost too intense.  The half chicken flavoring was intense, while the breading maintained its tenderness. Chicken was good, \u201cnot extremely special,\u201d but paired well with the breading. They probably brine the chicken, which makes it taste juicier than others.  Bonus: Passion Fruit Green Tea is a 10/10.  Overall, I would go again. 10/10. I don\u2019t have enough experience with fried chicken as my friend, but this is definitely up there and a must try.",

The reviews on here made it seem like a flavorful mix  of unique flavors. Maybe a little Leons mixed with an Asian flair but NO all we got was steaming hot pieces of poultry  that were soggy. If you\u2019re frying chicken at 400 degrees how does it come out greasy and soggy? We ordered half mild and half medium whole chicken (tray A). There was no hint of any flavors, no uniqueness, no Asian or \u201cCalifornia\u201d fusion. The mild was just heat. That\u2019s it. Heat. I\u2019ve eaten Leon\u2019s hot links, I\u2019ve eaten spicy hot Harold\u2019s gizzards and they had more complexity than Big Boss\u2019s chicken. Oh by the way the only difference between the mild and medium chicken was addition of smoked paprika. Wow, I put smoked paprika to add a layer of flavor to my dishes but I sure don\u2019t use it as a main ingredient. Frankly I\u2019m angry that I got taken for $36.00 for way below sub par food. I took the food home out of principal and threw it away. While on my walk home I wished a MF\u2019r would\u2019ve tried to mug me so I could take out my frustration of wasting my time and money at Big Boss Spicy Fried Chicken on them. Plus I\u2019ll leave you with this, how is the flesh of the chicken searing hot but the main joint of the wing cold? Frying half frozen pieces?",

Anyway, we saw this restaurant has quite good reviews and decided to come and try. We ordered the chicken sandwich and the wings. The chicken sandwich was medium spicy, but it was already very spicy for my husband. We usually have quite spicy food, but medium level was already very spicy for my husband so it means it\u2019s VERY spicy. The chicken wings were mild, and it already had some kicks. I enjoyed this one better. The fried chickens were very tasty, not just the batter only but also the meats. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the chicken wings were so big, each wing looked like a turkey leg. I wish they were smaller.  Overall: Menu: 4stars Service: 5stars Food: 4stars Price: $",

They have sides, too; the macaroni and cheese is delicious and creamy.  The batter/fry itself, WITHOUT SAUCE, is spicy (like Tobasco level) and then things get hotter with each sauce you add.

Everything was at a great price... the chicken was only about $9 for 4 tenders.  When I opened the box, I was SHOCKED by how large the portions were. On top of that, the chicken is much spicier than you think! I ordered just the medium spice and was expecting some typical buffalo wings... but it had much more flavor than that! If you really like spicy food, I think you might like the hotter flavors!!  I will DEFINITELY be ordering again sometime soon!!",
