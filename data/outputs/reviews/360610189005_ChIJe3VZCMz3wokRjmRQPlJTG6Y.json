They got me and my coworkers thru the pandemic as nurses with delicious food. The food comes piping hot and is perfectly spicy. I love it. I just wish there was another location because this is close to my job. But I know food like this can\u2019t be replicated. It\u2019s sooooo good. I can\u2019t say this enough. The drunken noodle is the best I\u2019ve had. Fried rice on point. Perfect sizes. Pricing great. Not many foods can I eat 3 times in one week but it\u2019s that good.",

I placed a delivery order through Seamless that was supposed to arrive within 25-35 minutes and it never showed up. After 1 hour of waiting, I called the restaurant to check on the status of the delivery. The restaurant kept insisting that the food had been delivered and they called my cell phone, however I NEVER received a phone call or text message, there was no food to be found in the lobby of my building, and the doorman had confirmed there was no food delivered in the timeframe that the restaurant insisted. I explained this to Living Thai and they were legit acting crazy on the phone, shouting at me, and refusing to give me a refund for the order. Shame on this restaurant for lying that food was delivered and shame on them for screaming through the phone about it. I will never eat at this place or order from them again. They did nothing to remedy the situation and they are a disgrace with horrible customer service.",

Then he told me he worked in the restaurant- LivingThai next door and asked me when would my cab arrive? I thought he was waiting too because he kept looking at the street after I said I called the cab. To my surprise, once my Via came, he just picked up all my luggage and lifted them up to the cab while the driver was not willing to help in the beginning\uff08totally understandable so I gave him hand sanitizers after he dropped me off). I was so grateful and I offered him tips but he was shocked and just smiled at me and shake his head. It turned out he was not waiting for his cab and he just waited to help me out!
