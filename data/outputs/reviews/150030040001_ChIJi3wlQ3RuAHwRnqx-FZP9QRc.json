Now before making any reviews anywhere this is the first thing it reads on the post mark is \"Tell others why you loved this place.\" As I'm reading it over and over in my head thinking of what to say I can't help but point out the part where it says \"loved\"... Maybe if I were to say goodbye forever! to this Artistically Wonderful!, Fun-mooded!, People Friends Families and Employees with nothing but Excellent Vibrations!, and even it's just quite a relaxing place and for some of us it is our Sanctuary. The food is not just GOOD FOOD! but it is GREAT! FOOOOOD!!! ITALIAN FOOOOOD! with a little twist of there own at times by some of the Coolest Chefs I've worked with yet so far in the 15 years I've worked in and out from kitchen to kitchen of all sorts. Chef Joel and Chef Nikolai and Ms Chef Heidi! are the 3 Holding it up for the past 8 Months now and they've brought many MANY! interesting additions to the Menu and straight to your table here at BETHEL UNION \"Ciao Down!\" \"Drink Up!\". They are fascinatingly Bringing Fusions of the holidays to the table year round!, The SEASONS!.. I personally have an interest in any place that will not hmmm... How should I say this, they are not breaking tradition but making Tradition with respects to what the people not just love to eat but some things people have never heard of or tried before. I'm not too literate when it comes to Italian Food and it's History of delicacy but this place seems to have The Simplicity, Delicacy, and Fine Affordable Dining when it comes to anything on the menu. So now then..... With all of this said i must say that I will definitely be going back again and again to see what NEW things come to the table In the Future of \"SEASONAL DINING\" here at Bethel Union.  I almost forgot to mention the BAR!!!  A very clean and comfortable look of the Bar and operated by the Coolest Boss and Bartenders EVER!!! A generous cup may be filled a long with a generous and friendly conversation to go with it. These Guys and Gal's aren't typical at all, just don't be shy and I am SURE OF IT!! You will Enjoy yourself.  Mahalo all for reading this review of mine, I hope it's served you some good Intel of what your looking for, May many Blessings be brought to you and this Beautiful place. Aloha and Much love to you All. Thank you! :)",

Disappointingly short pour on the vino too.  HOWEVER- IF we went back, it would be for the spaghetti and meatballs! They were REALLY GOOD!! Only thing that had good portion and excellent flavor.

However, there are a few things I'm hoping will get fixed.  1) Wait staff needs to chill a little. Give the party time to settle in - allow them space to make small talk, check out the menu, ask each other questions, deliberate on what they want to eat. During both of my visits, my full party hadn't arrived but those of us who were there ordered drinks as we waited. The wait staff kept coming by to check on us when it was obvious we were waiting for another guest. And, we were occupied with our drinks. They were just over zealous to make sure we were OK (which is not a bad thing and is much better than being ignored),  2) Temperature - the restaurant temperature was on the colder side during my first visit and it made the food go cold super fast. During my second visit, the temperature was a little better.  3) Timing - we ordered an appetizer but it came out with main course.  3) Bell dinging - when orders are ready to be served, the kitchen staff dings a bell which I'm assuming is to get the wait staff's attention (during my first visit, they hit a gong - no joke, it only happened once while i was there though). But the bell dinging makes me feel like I'm at a truck-stop diner - it's cool but it doesn't fit the restaurant atmosphere, so the noise really stood out to me.  That list of demands isn't so bad, right?  So, what did I love? I'll definitely return for the Farro Risotto. It wasn't mushy or too cheese-y - it was absolutely perfect. And, I was stoked to see a Rogue Sour Beer on their drink menu.",
