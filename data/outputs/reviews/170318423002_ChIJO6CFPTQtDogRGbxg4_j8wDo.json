Just one person eating the Restaurant Week menu will have leftovers so I\u2019d suggest ordering one fixed price menu and then a la carte if there\u2019s other things you want to try. You\u2019ll have plenty leftover. The pork dumplings are amazing. The \u201cMy Friend Gen\u201d drink was refreshing! Got a massive portion of JJ noodles! The KFC was good, but not the best in the city. The Fire chicken was underwhelming, tasted more smoky than flavorful. Our LA galbi was a little burnt, the pork belly was O-K... we ordered the ssam kit and it only had 2 perilla leaves, rest was lettuce. It was a fun experience and service was good. Excellent way to try new things.  I\u2019ll probably come back to try more dishes!",

However, I would say if you are going to attend during Restaurant week, the service is a bit slower, assuming that they were crazy busy! Our table of four took 2.5hrs total to have all the courses served. 5 stars though since the food was amazing and the waiter and bartender were very kind. Will definitely be returning.",

What I love the most about Perilla is that they have both traits that make a restaurant great, food and service. Top notch hospitality from the moment I walk in and I\u2019m greeted by the hostess to the end when I\u2019m given my check from the manager and personally wished a happy birthday. I\u2019m pretty sure I have been to all the Korean bbq spots in chicago and I think Perilla has the best meat quality and food preparations. I really cant name a dish that I haven\u2019t liked since I\u2019ve been there multiple time. (Yes, I have tried the whole menu) I got to meet Chef Andy and the managers Thomas and Yura, great people who know how to get the job done. As in give the paying guest a great experience! If you haven\u2019t been here you\u2019re missing out!",

I appreciated how accommodating the staff was with two hungry kids as well.  Although we were all already familiar with the smaller dishes (banchan) typically served at Korean restaurants, I was very impressed with how our server explained exactly what each small dish was. I've never experienced that before in a Korean restaurant and I felt that was a nice touch.  Appetizers: The seafood pancake was delicious. The pork dumplings were cooked perfectly - crispy and golden on the outside and juicy hot on the inside. The sauteed brussels sprouts was a great balance to the main meat courses ordered below.  Main dishes: The marinated prime short rib was flavorful and satisfying. The non-marinated prime rib eye was my favorite. The soybean stew was just like how my mom would make it.  I typically drink non-flavored soju with Korean food but our server recommended pairing our meal with the Plum flavor and I've never looked back. Order that.  Thanks for such a pleasant experience. Let's just say, I'll be back.",

(We didnt order a la carte but it said it is for 1 person on the menu)  There is a \"feast for 2\" and \"feast for 4\" that is a better deal.  There is a chance you can get seated at the same table with a different party already there.  Not a big deal, but would have preferred sitting at our own table.  They also ran out of perilla (sesame) leaves.  We only got 1 for the table and the lettuce they had was way too small to properly make a lettuce wrap with the meat.  The best part of the meal for me was the roasted asparagus. Food is good but imho not worth the price.  There are kbbq places just as good but much cheaper.  Although the price could reflect the location of the restaurant.  Giving it 4 stars just because the only complaint I have is the price. (And running out of perilla leaves).",

This almost never happens in a Korean restaurant, unless you're in a small mom and pop type of restaurant. One of our friend was vegan and I was a bit worried that she might not find anything to eat but she found many options and she loved it.  It was her 1st time trying Korean food.  Kimchee was authentic and so delicious.  Best of all, our beef was so good!  I also liked the the seating arrangements. We were seated on a long table, like a long picnic table.

Food ordered: 1. Marinated Prime Ribeye: literally melts in your mouth. The meat is super tender and the marinade is light and not overbearing so you can enjoy the taste of the meat. It\u2019s also served with a lettuce basket and dipping sauce so you can make ssam and enjoy it authentic korean bbq style. 2. Kimchi Stew 3. Sauteed Brussels Sprouts: SO GOOD. It\u2019s definitely a must try. It\u2019s a completely new flavor and texture profile from any \u201cAsian fusion\u201d restaurants. They add crispy garlic - yum! It\u2019s savory, light, nutty (almost) - you just have to try it. 4. Cheese Corn: has cojita cheese in it and reminds me of a light elote. 5. Steamed egg (I didn\u2019t order but shout out to the manager for giving us on the house!): THIS IS THE HIDDEN GEM. it\u2019s not like a traditional steamed egg served in most korean restaurants. Check out my photo and video of it. You must try!!  The food and service were on point! There\u2019s also a korean beer list which is a fun pairing with the food. The portion sizes are generous (I definitely over ordered) but so well worth it. It\u2019s a good dining experience for both \u201cseasoned\u201d korean bbq-ers and newbies.  The manager and owner both dropped by frequently to check in on us and made us feel so well taken care of.",

We ordered feast menu.  1) Some dumplings are cold inside.  2) Server didn't control fire well in the beginning and burnt some meat. They were too busy to serve several tables.  3) We ordered soybean stew but we didn't get until we finished all other food. We asked several times but the server said it would come out soon. And, it is funny, instead they brought kimchi stew, at the end. We rejected and they apologized. Even they said they will handle this. But, still final bill didn't deduct the soybean stew. We paid all.  This is my first review for a restaurant in Yelp. I visited this restaurant because of its good review, so decided to spend time to write this review to help others make good choice in future. Please avoid this restaurant.",

It has always  been an incredible experience. Travel to Chicago for work and was craving to try a korean restaurant here. Googled it. Looked good. Walked in the door. No acknowledgment. Escorted to a table. No acknowledgment from the korean waiters. A few minutes later the non Korean host approached me to see if I was ready to order. I asked for a soju. He had no idea what it was   Since he said \u201c I don\u2019t drink so I don\u2019t know what it is. \u201c He came back with a story that they ran out of soju. Had never heard this before in my lifetime. At this point I was ready to bail out. Decided to stay and order a traditional hot pot binbibop. Which I kid you not. It come out 3 minutes after I ordered it. Was it just sitting there. The small dishes arrived later. Usually if ordered in a hot pot. It would be extremely hot. Can\u2019t even touch it. This one warm. I have to admit. The only non korean waiter was extremely attentive after he noticed my discomfort. Also not crowded with plenty open tables. So that\u2019s not an excuse. I\u2019m not a complainer and this is my first negative review of a korean restaurant. Will never suggest this place. Thank god I live in nyc and travel often to Seoul.",

Personally I thought the brussels and the soup were a bit too salty. The Bulgogi was a little soggy somehow. Everything else was OK. I\u2019m not sure, maybe because I live very close to Glenview where there are a lot of great Korean restaurants, I wasn\u2019t amazed by the food. I liked the modern touch but I felt like it was too leaning toward traditional style. Usually when I go to a traditional Korean restaurant there are always a lot of Koreans eating there. I was very pleasantly surprised by the the diversity of crowd. Catering to the young people downtown I think the food could be more adventurous! Anyway, I would have given a 4.5 stars if there\u2019s an option. The amount of food we got for $120 was pretty impressive. We couldn\u2019t finish and had to take some home. The service was great and staff very friendly!",

The menu is really limited, I was hoping for a larger variety, like the other locations. This one has a very limited Korean BBQ menu, as well as sub-par side dishes that come along with the KBBQ. The service was definitely impeccable and spot on. One of the things contributing to the lack of a complete 5 star review was the Kimchi Fried Rice. The rice was definitely way too soggy. My friend and I left it to sit in the stone bowl for a bit longer and it still didn't get crispy enough. I don't recommend their Fire Chicken. It's just cubed dark meat chicken tossed in hot sauce with some cheese. The grill gets burnt way too fast and there's no vents above you to intake the smoke. There are vents around the ceiling, but very sparingly placed.",

They had a special Valentine's day menu ($75 for 2) but we ordered from the regular menu and it was great! Good variety of kimchi bites and meat. The seafood pancake was made to perfection! We also enjoyed the hot bulgogi stone bowl though it could have been spicier. Something that really made the difference for me is that they cook the meat for you on the grill right there in front of you (as opposed to us having to grill it ourselves). We had the pork belly done this way and it was amazing! Kudos to the fast service and our server Norrell! By the time we were done with our dishes and the myriad sides, we were full to the rim! Definitely one of my most enjoyable BBQ experiences!",

A guy escorted us to the bar area in the back as if there were seats available. When we got there he didn't see any availability so he said sorry we don't have seats. You guys can just stand by the bar and order drinks first. After explaining to us, he turned around and said oh look a seat opened up. He just gave us the menu and we were left to head towards where he pointed to the available area which had NO seats just bar tables. We had to take a chair from the people sitting next to us and it was only one chair. But we were left to organize our \"eating\" area. We took the paper towels and utensils from nearby tables and had to steal another chair from another table for our two top. Truly self service or bad service???  We ordered kimchi stew and bean paste stew. Kimchi stew was like literally someone dumping kimchi in and diluted it with water. What about seasoning?? Can you source better kimchi for the soup? Bean paste stew was the WORST. It was so salty that it was inedible. I had to dilute the stew with my drinking water. Even so it was still so salty that I just gave up and scooped out the veggies to eat. Someone didn't measure their miso paste right! It doesn't have to be authentic it just has to taste good. Which this place fails horribly. Husband said at least kimchi stew still tasted better than H-mart which meant it was edible but it's not Cho Sun Ok level if you know what I mean.  On top of that I informed the waitress that the soup was salty because she asked how everything was. She kindly apologized and said she'll inform the chef (it was her first day at the restaurant so I was being pretty calm about expressing how salty it was). She later came back and told me that the manager is waiting for me at the bar if I would like to speak with him. Wow! Not blaiming the new waitress because she was pleasant but shouldn't the manager come to me to apologize for the salty soup???? It sounded like I was called in for a trouble that I had caused. At this point I was extremely peeved. I asked for the check, paid for everything, and tipped like normal. Did not stop at the bar to talk to the manager because they don't deserve to hear my feedback at the restaurant if they don't make the effort to drop by to talk about their horrible food.",

I love this because most other Korean spots are far up north and it\u2019s a hassle to get up there. Their grilled pork dish, egg appetizer dish and kimchi soup are solid.

The prices are on the high end, particularly compared to Koreatown restaurants, which are considerably more reasonably priced. (Our bill came out to more than $300 for five people.) I would\u2019ve liked to have seen more banchan \u2014 a measure of a kitchen\u2019s skill and a hallmark of Korean-style generosity/hospitality when it comes to food. But San Soo Korean BBQ would be a good introduction to Korean food for the curious-minded, especially because the staff speaks English.",

Lots of servers roam the room. Your greeted immediately you go through the front door. I went straight from the office without a reservation. A really bad move if you want to eat at a table with a hot plate. Which looked a lot of fun. But a 40 minute wait. However there is another option. All the high top tables and 2 seat tables do not have hot plates. So you can't cook your own. But to my mind that's not a bad thing. We were seated immediately. Had the dumplings. Half pork, half veg. Korean pork and a beef hot bowl. They were great. Flavorful. Service was slick and efficient. Cocktails, wine, bottled and draught beers. Some nice offerings. Be aware there is no parking. A whole new eating experience. San Soo is a great addition to River North. I highly recommend giving it a try.",
