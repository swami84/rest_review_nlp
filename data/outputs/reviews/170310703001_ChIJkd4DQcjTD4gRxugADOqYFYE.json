Each time I visit,  I am inspired to eat healthier and to keep adding raw food to my daily diet, and that is an added benefit. I have dined in Mehmet's former restaurant years ago and hope that he will continue to serve his community with healthy eats. I also appreciate how friendly and a great host he has proven to be!

The place is clean as a a whistle and the hospitality was matchless! Something you don't usually find in raw restaurants. The chef was very graceful and had a pleasant conversation with us.  The only teeny tiny thing I wasn't happy about is that there was steam coming out of my soup.  Which doesn't tell me it's \"raw.\" Also, the patties and rice pilaf on the kebab platter had burnt sides. The broccoli, beet and carrot on the kebab stick were extremely soft, and tasted steamed. In any case, I trust that the chef tried to keep the temperature below 118 degrees while nuking all that up, since most of the stuff we ordered was pre-made. Albeit, everything was very tasty!",

It was fun to see what the vegan-rendition would be on some of these classic menu items. All fresh ingredients - you can tell the staff takes care of the food they prepare. Would highly recommend Zest, even if you're unfamiliar with vegan cuisine. The chef even threw in a free dessert - carrot cheesecake - the perfect end to a great meal!",

I encourage everyone to try it at least once, I know vegan food can be scary, and I can only image what raw veganism sounds like! But trust me on this one. I promise that you won't regret it! Not to mention the obvious health and nutritional benefits of adding more raw plant-based meals to our diets. As with all vegans choosing raw vegan is compassionate, and therefore deserves our thoughtful consideration. Choosing raw doesn't mean depriving our tastebuds either. Zest Raw Vegan Eats is situated in Lincoln Park. Chef Mehmak Ak specializes in organic living foods and wholefoods. Stop in and enjoy everything from their Meze and smoothie's, to fresh juices and Kombucha teas, to their awesome coffee. You can top it off with his specialized guilt-free unbaked raw desserts. At Zest Raw Vegan Eats, you can actually have your cake and eat it (and come back for another raw meal) too!",
