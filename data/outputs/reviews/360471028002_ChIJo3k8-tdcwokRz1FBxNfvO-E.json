I had previous incidents with them, and the only reason I continue making orders with them is because I can\u2019t change my delivery location. They are big time liars. Yesterday, I had order some cinnamon bread twists and I didn\u2019t received the frosting! I called they said they would deliver it to my house within 10-15. They never came so I called again, they said they are sure they put it in the box.. I said why would I call for some icing if you guys did ? Once again they said they call their delivery guy.. THEY NEVER DELIVERED IT. I regret giving the guy tip as well. Very dishonest. I ended up not eating my bread twists because they were COLD AND TASTELESS. Thank God Dominos has the delivery insurance, I used that to claim for this  terrible customer service. Ralph Avenue is way better. Too bad I can\u2019t change my delivery location to it.",

I normally order from papa johns but they were not delivering today so against my better judgment  i ordered Dominos. the food came 1 1/2 hours after ordering.  It left the store for delivery at 6:20 but did not reach my door until 7:16. When the food arrived the delivery guy asked for a tip!!!!! I told him it was on the card (i payed online). I thought that was rude and i have never had that happen before. As soon as i touched the box i could tell that it was cold. upon opening the box the pizza looked like death. It was cold, super dry and hard. I am extremely disappointed. I feel like my money was stolen and I was given garbage in exchange. the only reason i ate it was because im 9 months  preg and have a 1 1/2 year old and by the time it came we thought we were going to starve from the wait.",

I stood there waiting on a young lady who was on the phone, not speaking to anyone but probably listening to the person on the other side of the call for about 5-7 minutes without even acknowledging me.  I beckoned to a young lady who was coming from the back.  I ordered 3 large 3-topping pizza that I knew were on special because I purchased it normally on Fridays. She tried her best, but could not help because she was quoting me the original price, so she asked the other young lady to help.  Now time is running out because I have a pizza party at my daughter's school and they needed the pizza for 12.15 pm.  The young lady told me that I had to order the pizzas online because they cannot do it in the store.  I told her I'd left my phone at home and I ordered the said pizza at the store all the time when I am unsuccessful online.  She insisted that she couldn't do it because it is an online deal.  I said to her that I understand and now that I know I will try to order them online in the future but for now, I really do not have anymore time to go home to get on the computer and order it. She just turned her back on me, so I ask for management.  I was told by the other young lady that she (the lady who turned her back) was the manager. I went home picked up my phone and returned to the store at about 11.50 and explained to her the problems I was having.  She just said oh I never ordered it online. It did not take her 10 seconds to put in the order. I am thinking what a ridiculous, difficult, inflexible human being. No conscience at all.  First if this is company policy not to take the order in store it should have been said from day one. Secondly, you could have place the order and warn me that this is not company policy seeing that you were the ones who violated the rules in the first place. If this is customer service for this outlet, I do not want to come back and buy anything more pizza from this store.  I realized also that many people are complaining about this outlet.  Do something or else you will be closing down soon.",

The guy that answered my call didn't understand what the hell I was ordering. The deal has the 2 medium one topping pizza. Parm bites and cinna twist with a free drink. He was charging everything separate. Instead of the total being around 20 dollars. It went up to 38 dollars. We asked to speak to someone else. The second person was completely rude. Asking why did we order two large when in fact we never did. Then telling my husband in a yelling rude way to answer him first did we want a medium or large. My husband told them to cancel our order because they were extremely rude and seems like they didn't understand English at all. I miss the original people that were working at that location they were never rude to us.",

I waited on my front porch and left my gate open as i stood by the front door, the driver yelled out the window telling me I had to come to the car and get my pizza because he refuses to get out the car to walk to the gate. My neighborhood or being 5 feet female shouldn\u2019t  pose as a threat, so the drivers behavior to me was weird. Although I was skeptical because I never had a delivery guy tell me to approach his car I approach the car, i handed him his money and he handed me the pizza through the car window then he drove off. The pizza box was open and the pizza almost slipped out the box. I immediately call the manager (Mohammed) who informed me that the new store policy states that drivers are not to leave the car when delivering after 10 PM and that he will send the driver back to give me another pizza. After waiting over an hour,  I called the manager asking for an update and letting him know I would now like my money back , the manager ended the call abruptly.  The driver came 10 minutes later  to give me my money back however The driver also named Mohammed asked to see the pizza, I showed him the pizza untouched at his satisfaction  he then tells me to place it on his car seat on the passenger side before he gives me my money at this point I\u2019m upset. I had enough of this driver. A female in the middle of the street at 12 AM going through all this trouble to get back $7.61. I placed the pie on the hood of the car and started to record our exchange. I demand my money he then acts as if he\u2019s going to give My money, but as i reached to get my money he drove off. My arm hitting the car window. I reached out to corporate still waiting for a response. If you can avoid this location please do.",

Second mistake now I waited two and a half hours for my food and it's somewhat understandable because of the weather but now he finally came and didn't want to get out his car. Now he's sitting there calling my cell phone seeing me standing at the door and after the 4th time of calling cell phone he opens his car window and yells (yo I ain't got to get out the car you got to come over here to the car to get your food.) So I told him (after waiting two and a half hours he can keep the food) he said okay and left.  I thought I would give them another try and the third order was good I got my food delivered to the door with no problem now I just ordered some more and I'm getting the same story as a second order the person rolls down her window and says this is only curbside delivery you have to come to the car and get it. I'm at a private house my, shoes are downstairs and so I have no shoes on, the ground is hot and they can't bring it to my door. I understand the Domino hotspots are curbside delivery and if they feel threatened they don't have to deliver to the door but this is neither case. She said she didn't have to get out of her car then the store called said the same thing and they left with the food  Just went for a pickup order the little girl on the nights needs to lose that little attitude that she has other than that hopefully the food is good",

I had a choice of picking it up or cancelling my order.When I went to cancel my order I was told it would take up to five days to get my money back because I used my credit card. So I had no choice but to pick it up or have them hold on to my money and get no food.

Food is almost never made according to my specifications, items are frequently forgotten in large orders, pizza tracker is usually at delivery within ten minutes of ordering yet food takes almost an hour to arrive from across the street and drivers are typically not friendly or courteous. I can't believe they can't even make decent cinnastix. You just put cinnamon on bread and bake it... That's it. Smh. For the trouble you might as well make it yourself.",

Then I called back a second time and they had the nerve to answer the phone then hang up on me. This is my first time ordering and it will surely be the last. They are the worst , as I am writing this review I am still waiting for the pizzas... shame on domino's, they need to stop advertising and fix the mess in their restaurants..
