It's nothing fancy, but the food is consistently good and hits the spot when you have a craving. I need to try more things on their menu!

They deliver great home-cooked meals that swear you are in Thailand. Do not follow my old habits, but head to this wonderful restaurant to tickle your taste buds.  Why this Restaurant in particular and not the others? Food of course... The service they provided was amazing, so I would give them an A+. A few days ago, I have pretended that I never ate Thai food before, just to see how they would deliver their customer service. You know is very important to deliver excellent customer experience, then work backward towards the food. The gentlemen delivered just that from the minute I stepped through their doors to time I said good night. I guess, they want to make sure you are happy, if not they will feel disappointed.

I asked for a spoon 5 times until my coworker who ordered soup asked for it herself. Yes, I know staff forget stuff but I had asked 5 times, 3 to the same person and 2 to another one. It was also not crowded that time. They even had enough time to just watch us as we ate. The staff kind of came off as strange to be honest. Probably would not come back unless with a group.",

The spring rolls are not the large ones but the delicately delectable little ones. I\u2019d go as far as ordering one order for each member of your party if you love spring rolls as much as we do. The fried tofu was a good portion for 2 - 3 people to share. The pineapple fried rice was mild and fresh and the noodles went bye-bye in a hurry as my kids cleaned the plates. The Thai iced tea is made with half-&-half and not coconut milk. I wish they made a coconut milk version. But the wait explained the vegan and non-vegan option. The version without any cream tasted really good too. Overall, this is a solid choice for Thai food and I would recommend this place.",

We were rushed to order by a hovering waiter who made a strange suggestion to change our appetizer after placing the order. While we were waiting for the food the staff was banging the windows shut outside. Lasted ten minutes. The food was incredibly mediocre and we had to send one dish back. Curry soup was so watery that the noodles didn\u2019t even retain the flavor. I have worked in restaurants for the last five years and I understand that it can be annoying when people come in when you are ready to close. That being said it is unprofessional to rush customers and to give I\u2019ll prepared food. Waiters apologized at the end saying they were rushing to go home, but I wish I didn\u2019t have to spend $40 for a bad meal and bad service. If you don\u2019t want customers, don\u2019t seat them",

It was soooo good and I even ordered extra sauce which was $3 extra (pricey for sauce I know), but believe me it's worth it.

Only suggestion would be to use a better quality meat, pretty fatty and not much meat. Vegetables great option for a lighter meal; fried rice tasty and nice kick with the spices IG: @tutieats",

This place is cozy, the staff was friendly. Now lets go to the main reason. You must try the fried shrimp from the appetizer. =A++ Summer Roll was good like every other place, but the spicy dipping sauce was there house special, I love it! =A+ Not sure what they seasoned Fried chicken wing, was pretty damn good. =A Cucumber Salad was another of our favorite, lime flavor. =B+ Careful with Spicy Pad Thai, I can eat spicy, but this was pretty spicy, not sure if everyone can take the heat. =A The beef green curry was awesome too, the level of spicy is perfect for me. =A The staff were great, always have a great smile. Finally a legit Thai place that I can go to in williamsburg. I am will come back to try the other dish!",
