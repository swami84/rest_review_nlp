I wasn\u2019t sure if the ham and egg was interesting enough to try, but I was blown away by how good it was. The flavors range from sweet to savory. I recommend in trying all of them.

I came here with two friend and we luckily got a seat at the gold countertop. I ordered the black sesame latte, chicken katsu curry, and the berry and cream cheese toast. Yes, it was a decent amount of food for one person but I was hungry!  The black sesame was surprisingly packed with that nutty black sesame flavor and was delicious iced. Fun fact: They made it in a magic bullet!  The chicken in the chicken katsu curry perfectly crispy and he curry tasted like the typical Japanese curry. The only downside is that the portion was pretty small for $20.  My friend ordered the spicy cod caviar pasta  and I tried and bite and it was SO GOOD. I\u2019ll probably order it next time.  Last but not least, I ordered the berry and cream cheese toast. And to be honest, I ordered it because it was pretty :)",

I ordered the Sugar Butter toast and a plain pour over coffee for breakfast this morning. I was pleasantly surprised, and honestly almost moved to tears due to how delicious the meal was! I am not kidding! I felt my eyes well up. The fluffy milk bread was perfectly toasted and had a light and sweet coating of sugar, providing a crispy crunch with each bite. The potato salad was out of this world. Seriously underrated. Hands down-probably the best potato salad I have ever tried. The coffee was not too hot and not too cold, it was served to me at the perfect temperature which I appreciated. Sometimes you go to places and they serve you piping hot coffee and you have to wait at least 15 minutes before you can take a sip without burning yourself. The server was so very kind and accommodating. I don't know his name but he was wearing a green beanie and a grey sweatshirt, he was an absolute sweetie. The place itself is quaint but so relaxing. I got there first thing in the morning so it was empty. They played classical music as I enjoyed my breakfast which was perfect background music for this delightful experience. As I left I was thanked by another worker who was a woman and both her and the male server said a kind goodbye to me as I left with my belly full of this delicious food.  I have literally never felt more compelled to get online and write a good review in my life. This was truly a wonderful time I had at Davelle and I will be sure to return on my next trip to New York. Perfect start to my day. If I could rate it 100 stars I would!",
