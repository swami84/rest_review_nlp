In the meantime we ordered apps, all of them. The cheese curds came out pretty fast, still waiting for the drinks. Waiter came over and said our drinks will be right up. Waited another 15 minutes and another waiter said our drinks are coming. At this point we decided to get up and leave. We stood up and walked out. No one tried to stop us. They just watched as we walked out the door. Complete waste of time. The menu was expensive and the staff was brutal.

I do not do this but it was $15. My friend and I each had one--one with vodka, one with gin (even though we both ordered the one with vodka and were brought one of each...). We even tried to switch. No go. The menu is fine. The cheese curds are the highlight...but that's pretty much frozen stuff thrown in a fryer. I ordered Fish n chips and I didn't even get malt vinegar so it tasted like eating cardboard. Even the fries had no taste. I had a bite of the burger my friend ordered--it was tasty. The short ribs were also good, but I was famished. There weren't enough of them. The prices are disproportionate to the sizes of the dishes. The staff are all flighty and I made an opentable reservation and told the host that I was there for my reservation from opentable upon arrival, but they marked me as a no show so I didn't collect my points. WTF.",

Quite the opposite, each time I walked away feeling like I had a wonderful experience. The food, the attentive and friendly service (tonight was Kris; thanks Kris), both spot on each and every time.  Tonight, I went with my girlfriend and another couple. It was their first time, and they were blown away. One of them literally \"wowed\" on the steak and the other one on the chocolate cheesecake. Personally, the sea bass beans and beignets were my favorite.  It's not cheap (though it ranges from a $16 burger to $38 steak), but that's reasonable for the quality of flavor and service. This is a perfect splurge for a special date night or special occasion dinner.",
