When the food finally arrived it was just a little warm almost cold and to top it off our Thai teas looked like carrot juices, we asked for 1 without ice and either they gave us all 3 without ice or the ice melted from the time they served it to they time they delivered it. So disappointed it\u2019s always something when we order for delivery, the food is ok but when you\u2019re set a lunch time and don\u2019t get to eat because of bad service or incorrect orders it\u2019s just not worth the frustrations this was our last straw.",

I recommend placing the order on their website instead of Seamless etc because it\u2019s better for them AND they give you a slight discount!

This is a step up from Chinese takeout and not in a good way. They are in inconsistent in their food- one day you get Jasmin rice another day regular white rice. Their  garlic chicken was tasteless, and gummy. It didn't even look like chicken. They are stingy in their portions. They serve a few pieces of your choice of protein with lots of veggies.  I'm not impressed, not pleased and won't waste my money.",

For $8-$10,  the lunch special is a very good deal.  From 12pm-4pm, you get a bottle of water, a salad, choice of appetizer, and entree.  So far I have had well over a dozen Spicy Basil dishes here, a Rama dish, a few rice dishes, plus spring rolls and gyoza.  The food here is much better than at Tung Thong 181.  However, as is typical in New York, the dishes sometimes contain a bit too much salt and soy sauce.  If they tone those down, they'll have a much better taste experience.  Otherwise the food is very fresh, and I tend to come back here at least 1x-2x a week (although the cashiers never seem to recognize me, lol).  The place is very small inside and has only a few tables.  The inside also has a faux rustic feel which looks a bit silly (you'll see what I mean).    Still, it's pleasant enough if you can get a seat.   Otherwise I imagine they'll thrive as a take out place.  Now if we can only get a Trader Joe's in Washington Heights!   Then we're set.",

It seems that most businesses they have are either pick up or delivery. They did have a couple of small tables, and a small counter seating by the window.  They have some enticing lunch special menu at great price, and our luck would have it, they offer it for brunch too! They come with complimentary side salad, a choice of starter, and a water. The water can be upgraded to Thai Iced Tea or Soda for additional cost. We got the Thai Iced Tea (additional $2 for upgrade from water). It was really good, kind of nutty, and very sweet as expected.  We had Vegetable Gyoza and Fried Tofu as starters. They were small in portion, but they are starters... Gyoza were steamed, not fried. Tofu were very firm, with a bit of kick to it from the tasty sauce.  For main, we had Massaman Curry with Fried Fillet Fish, and Street Pork Noodle Soup.  Curry was coconut-y and sweet, but not too sweet. Nice amount of rice and loads of lightly fried white fish, which was very tasty! The Noodle Soup was so good! Light with almost translucent broth and noodle, not heavy at all. Earthy and comfy, very homey and flavorful.  It was very satisfying, we were full with just a little over $20! The female staff was very friendly and welcoming also, we will be sure to return!",

        "caption": "Note: This used to be Hua Yung Kitchen.  I will definitely miss my Chinese go-to place, but SUROSS is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. A cozy Thai  spot for take-out or a quick bite.  Prices are comparable to the 181 Tung Thong nearby and other Thai places in the area. Although the sit-down area is not as big, the food is top quality and very tasty! I usually use Pad Thai as a \"baseline\" comparison in Thai restaurants and here, it is definitely the best I've had in the neighborhood.  The problem others have is either too oily, too sweet, or a combination of both. SUROSS does it just right.  Highly recommend giving them a try, especially now with their 20% discount. I know I will be back!",
