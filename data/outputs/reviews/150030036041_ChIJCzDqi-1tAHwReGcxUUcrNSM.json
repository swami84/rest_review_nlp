The shrimp in my shrimp curry was frozen, but, for $10/plate, that is acceptable. Few restaurants could pull off fresh shrimp at that price. The food was authentic and, unlike many establishments, very nice and spicy when you ask for it.  The austerity of this restaurant is complemented by its authenticity, I can't help but give them a good rating. Try it for yourself!",
