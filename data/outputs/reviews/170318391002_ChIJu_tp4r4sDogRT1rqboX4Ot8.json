They say it is because it is a private club but you have no way of knowing that until you are in the restaurant reading their menu. So between the service charge and the tip you are paying 40% of your total bill.  The food is average at best in my opinion and the craftsman dining room has an old vibe playing elevator music. I would not recommend it. There are so many better restaurants in Chicago  I am extremely disappointed in the amount we paid for the food. The value is not there.  I called the restaurant after we left because it really bothered me that we didn\u2019t know about the 20% service charge until we saw the menu. The manager called me and was extremely rude. I rarely write reviews but I didn\u2019t want other people to be taken advantage of as we were.",

Immediately, the Metropolitan Club came to mind as a place that would as unforgettable as it was beautiful. From the beginning, the team at the Metropolitan, namely Sally Woodson, made the entire process as seamless as ever. We had the lovely experience of allowing all of our guests to go up to the SkyDeck before the happy hour which really wowed everyone. From there, the food and the whole evening were absolutely perfect! Our guests still tell us about how much they enjoyed the night, which truly makes us so happy.

There was practically nobody seated in the dining room, but service was still extremely slow. The server was polite, but not attentive. We asked for dessert menus, received them, and then waited for fifteen minutes for our server to reappear. The steak was good, but my chicken was raw. When I asked the server to take my plate away, there was no apology. I work in customer service. I understand the server was not to blame, but there still should be an apology on behalf of the restuarant. The couple at the table behind us got out and walked out because they waited to pay for so long and their server never came back. After I politely told our server my chicken was raw, she pretty much ignored us for the rest of the night. The entrees (that wasnt raw) were good, but not worth the price. The drinks we had were delicious. My husband's dessert had clearly just been taken out of the fridge and put in the microwave for a few seconds until the pastry had become hard. All in all not a good experience.",

The clientele is upscale, especially since yu need to be a member to hang out here. I had the pleasure of being invited by a member who also treated me to lunch (yay)! So... I decided to try Oysters Rockefeller, Calamari, Lobster Bisque, Chicken Vegetable Soup, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Chicken Pesto and the Scallops. I know thats a lot of food, LOL. My favorite out of everything we tried was the Chicken Pesto. It was simply delicious! The least favorite items was the Butternut Squash Ravioli. It was dry and not flavorful at all. This item I would recommend they take off the menu, actually. Everything else, was delicious and fresh. Tip: Ask for the complementary cookies at the end of yur meal.  I would absolutely recommend this place, I mean at least give it a shot. If not for the food, the atmosphere and people watching (yu never know who yu will run in to), is totally worth it. This is also a great place to \"work from home\".",

I would have my wedding here a thousand times over! My guests are still raving about the night. The beauty, the view, the food, and experience! Everything was lovely! Only thing I wish I could\u2019ve done was have enough time for all my guests to go to the sky deck. We had that planned, but didn\u2019t realize it would take an hour per table to go up there. So, we nixed it the day of. But, Sally ensured that we\u2019d get a refund for that. If you want that aspect to be a part of your wedding, start earlier than 5 and plan accordingly. Anyway, very beautiful day. I wish I could relive it again :). Can\u2019t wait to go back for our anniversary dinner! They offer you a complimentary anniversary dinner and replica wedding cake- so no need to save the top after your wedding!",

Finally 5 months from our wedding I had to call her and she finally sent me a time line on when and how to get things going - pick out linen, taste test food, reach out to the bakery to cake taste test and so on. We unfortunately had a terrible family incident and needed to reschedule the date. They keep your $5,000 deposit and then some depending on the date you were at in the contract. By the time we heard back on available dates from Ashley and manager Rick, we were already at the %50 timeline and would have to pay $11,000 unless we resigned a new contract right away then it would have been %40 ($9,000). Mind you, we spoke to them between November/December and they had several dates still open in 2017- March, April, May, August,October and November. So they wanted us to pay $9,000 then resign the contract and pay a new $5,000 deposit and start all over.  Even though they reiterated that they tried to work with us the best they could, I think its sad to charge your customer $11,000 even though you are going to still book with the venue. All we needed was a new date due to unfortunate circumstances, yet they still charge you a tremendous amount of money. Maybe when signing the contract they should let their customers know of this in advance. Whats even worse is that we paid the $11,000 and said we still planned on getting married here and we have not heard from Ashley or Rick once...... Took the money and could care less. Terrible-",

At 67 floors up you're actually more in touch with the surrounding architecture instead of seeing rooftops and air conditioning units. The bar is top shelf. The lounge area is extremely relaxing. All in all an exceptional experience.",

        "caption": "Picture you're sitting in the clouds overlooking the beautiful lights of downtown Chicago while sipping a nice glass of rose - this pretty much sums up what dining at the Metropolitan Club is like. The restaurant is located on the 67th floor of the Sears Tower (oops...even to this day I don't acknowledge the name change) and the views are breathtaking.  Normally, commoners like me aren't able to snag a table at this place because you need a membership to dine here, but as a part of a promotion, the impossible become possible. The interior of the space is dimly lit which really accentuates the views of downtown - great place to impress your special someone (with a membership of course, lol)  Our server Kyle did a great job answer all of our questions and point us in the right direction in terms of entrees. We ended up going with the:  BEEF CARPACCIO The thinly pounded layers of beef were seasoned great and went really well when paired with the thin toast like crackers that they were served with  LOBSTER BISQUE This was the star of the apps for sure. The soup had a strong and rich lobster flavor with large chunks of lobster throughout the soup. Like other restaurants I've been to, I entertained the thought of licking the bowl, but restrained myself.  SMOKED SALMON PENNE The pasta was cooked aldente and the alfredo type sauce had a wonderful smoked salmon flavor and came served with smoked mussels which were absolutely incredible.  GRILLED MAHI MAHI The mahi mahi was a lighter option which was served with nuggets of fried crayfish and a lovely Thai style salad with a tangy vinaigrette.  As for desserts, they brought out a sample of their cheesecake, bread pudding and chocolate pie. I must say the bread pudding was the standout - it was warm gooey and so satisfying after wrapping up our meal. Kyle did a great job checking in on us without being overbearing. Of course the best thing of the night was our spectacular view of the city from our seats. I might actually consider getting a membership here after my experience!",
