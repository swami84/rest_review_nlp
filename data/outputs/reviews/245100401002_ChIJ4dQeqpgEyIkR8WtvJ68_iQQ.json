Their dumplings, pork buns and leaf wrapped rice were all amazing and a full meal for 2 came to less than 30 dollars. I'll absolutely be a repeat customer.",

Compared with the other one I visited two days ago, it seemed a lot deserted here, and no one came at six o'clock. The decoration is quite satisfactory, not too cold, but not too delicate. Perhaps the only bright spot is the painting on the wall (Shanghe on the Qingming Festival?)  Older pop music plays in the background.  The price of the food seems a bit not cheap.  That being said, the dishes are really delicious. Scrambled eggs with shallots. After I haven't eaten scrambled eggs for a long time, I will still feel a little moved when I eat eggs again. The fish-flavored shredded pork looks a bit dark, but the taste is surprisingly good.  If you haven't tried it before, it is recommended to try it and you will not regret it. But if I want to come again later, I am less worried about parking and downtown security, and parking requires money, at least at night I dare not come over to eat alone.

        "caption": "This review is for dim sums only.  I am a sucker for dim sums. This is one of the worst dim sums I have had in the US.  I would give a 3 star for delivery. The website said the delivery starts only at 6pm. I ordered around 4pm via yelp. I received a call from the restaurant asking if I want the food earlier and that they could deliver in an hour. I said yes. The actual delivery was right on.  One star for dim sum. I feel that the food is not tasty and poorly made. Also, the portion was not generous at all. For example, my order included chicken feet, a pretty standard menu item at dim sum restaurants. It came with 3 chicken feet. (Usually it is about 6 or even 7 feet at other dim sum places in my experience). I am also unimpressed with Beef Tripe with Ginger and Scallion, Hom Sui Gok,  Pumpkin Rice Cake and Roast Pork Lo Mein. I would give passing marks to Mini Sweet Rice with Lotus Leaves, Steamed Roasted Pork Buns and Steamed Shanghai Juicy Buns though. Another let down was they did not include chilly oil in the delivery. Maybe I should've asked for it specifically rather than assuming that it is standard.  I have had other chinese food items at this restaurant and think that they are ok. There is a possibility that I will come again but will never order dim sums again.",

It smelled mouldy in first 10mins ... we ordered some dimsums.  All of them were home made but not sure whether they were freshly made or heated up from frozen, especially the pork dumpling, they didnt taste fresh though.  The rice roll with shrimp was the best, I can guarantee this was freshly made and the rice was so good, not too stickly.  Shrimp dumpling tasted good too.  Environment and service brought down the overall rating...food was alrite...worth tobtry if you never had dimsum before,.it's the only restaurant you can taste canton.dim sum.",
