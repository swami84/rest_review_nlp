This is unacceptable someone really need to look into this business they are raising prices because they aren\u2019t doing good business and also the chicken is not real meat and they don\u2019t want this to me know.  The manager won\u2019t provide a number or email to send a formal complaint and will delete the ones online off. The lady who runs the cash register is lucky she is a work I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t talk to people the same way outside the environment. But as long as the manager is there she is allowed to talk to you any way and be rude and only speak to people who she like. If she doesn\u2019t like you you don\u2019t get a hello talk about customer service.",
