For cocktails he got the Gowanus Sunset and I got the Citlali - both drinks were very tasty and went down quick (too quick).  My favorite thing we ordered was the Fisherman's Stew with Grilled Lobster (photo below). We also ordered the Gowanus Plateau: oysters from Maine and NY, clams from Maine, shrimp cocktail, 1/2 lobster tail chilled with tarragon alioli and Main Uni. All of the seafood was super fresh and delicious.  I loved their migonette sauce and fresh horseradish to go with the oysters.  Everything was so good we didn't stop there- we went on to the Kale salad- super fresh and light, clam toast was incredible and I wanted a whole loaf of bread to soak up the sauce.  We also ordered Thai curry mussels with chorizo and the fisherman's stew with grilled lobster.  All of the sauces were amazing and made each bite enjoyable.  To end the meal we shared the chocolate mouse - I'm not a dessert person but this is by far the best dessert i've had - not too sweet or heavy (see photo).",

My only regret is not having enough stomachs to eat all the things.  Please come support this amazing gem of a restaurant -- I am always thankful that the dishes they have here exist for me to enjoy.

Not sure how they justify their pricing, considering they are in a much worse neighborhood. It\u2019s very similar to Luke\u2019s lobster roll, yet charging twice the amount Luke\u2019s charges.  We also had a clam roll which only had 6 clams. You need to order two rolls to have enough clams for one good roll.  I will say the lobster and clams were cooked perfectly, firm yet quite moist, and their Cole slaw is excellent.  Lastly, their fresh donuts are excellent.",

The littleneck clams tasted fresh and clean, the shrimp cocktail was excellent. For me the star was the clam roll...it tasted amazing and was stuffed full. I highly recommend it! Also the crab cake was light and flavorful. Then dessert came...YUM...these little donuts, made fresh, hot soft inside, crispy outside, with a Jameson infused whipped cream. I enjoyed the entire experience and will be visiting again bringing friends & family. I hope my next experience will be as great as my first, for my expectations are quite high now, so many places fall off because the quality goes down.

They never called.  We obviously did not fit their upscale hipster demographic.  Felt unwelcome.  I wonder if the human rights commission, or even the local paper, would send testers.  In response to the rude response from the owner, I was reminded of my family's absolutely horrible experience at Littleneck from about a year ago, by the similar, but milder, rudeness I experienced yesterday at Insa.  That review was similar, but milder.  What we experienced at Littleneck has stuck with me for all this time.  This review is under my name, and I am a real person who, together with my family, was really insulted by our treatment.  The condescending tone still shows, even when the owner tries to respond:  I didn't \"think\" this happened to us.  It happened.  My wife talked me out of filing a discrimination complaint.  We couldn't decide whether it was age (my take), race (my wife's take) or just that we weren't hip enough (my daughter's take).",

I ordered steamers to supplement my meal which are difficult/fun to eat, but the portion was still lacking. I went home and ordered pizza.  Stick to this place for happy hour oysters ($1) and drafts (the wine menu is expensive). Also, dessert - every dessert I've had here is out of the this world. Who would have thought?!",

Unfortunately, the oysters weren't shucked terribly well -- lots of bits of shell. Burger, pie and salad were fine, but nothing really got me excited. The best thing about the place is the decor, it feels like you're really at the beach.",
