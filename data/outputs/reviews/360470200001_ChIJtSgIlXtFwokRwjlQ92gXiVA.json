Fresh spinach, pickled red onions, heirloom beans (?), And queso fresco, etc.    This salad was so great I saved half for lunch today and it was so fresh it didn't wilt in my fridge overnight ( sometimes that crisper drawer works well).  It was so delicious to me that I didn't even use the balsamic chili dressing, even though that was pretty tasty.  I am not a big salsa guy but there's is mucho fresco.... There are a number of above average Mexican restaurants in this area of southern Brooklyn but this is amongst the too of them.  Highly recommend based on my experiences.  I'm not sure on their phase 2 status yet but someday I wil definetely visit to eat at their establishment.",

        "caption": "I'm going to have to base my review on my delivery experience on Cinco de Mayo - I understand it's going to be extremely busy for a Mexican restaurant on this day of the year. I called to follow up after 2 hours and was told it would be 30 minutes more. I called again after another hour and was told AGAIN it would be another 30 minutes and that was when my patience ran out. While it was bad enough they never gave me an accurate ETA and I had to cancel the order, they never issued a refund and I had to reach out to Grubhub to process it. I will definitely give this business another chance as I understand the current challenging environment all local businesses are facing in this pandemic, they definitely dropped the ball on this. I ordered expecting there to be a delay and was more than patient, however, I should have been given an accurate ETA and not have had ambiguous time windows thrown at me when I tried to follow up.",

On a side note, they do not have a liquor license as of yet, so no cerveza with your food, just soda and juice. Now having said this, they make some very excellent Mexican food. My wife had a selection of tacos, which were nice and fresh. All presented very clean, no globs of sour cream or refried beans or loads of cheese, just nice clean flavors. Personally, I had the Churrasco which was grilled to my requested medium rare. Well seasoned and served with rice and beans and some guacamole. I left nothing on my plate, not a single bean. Also, order the guac as an appetizer which was served with freshly fried tortilla chips and this delicious smoky salsa. All in all, I hope they stay in business for many many years because I will be back.",
