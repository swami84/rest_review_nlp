The restaurant gave off a warm and home like vibe with the exposed brick, curtains, bright lime green walls, wood paneling and trims, and wood furniture.  My boyfriend and I came here for Winter 2020 Bethesda Restaurant Week and each of us enjoyed four tapas and one dessert for only $27.  Our server Laura was nice, polite, friendly, and attentive throughout our dinner. Instead of getting a discounted wine bottle, we decided to have a pitcher of Red Sangria, which consisted of red wine, ice, and diced apples. It was strong, sweet, and fruity.  Instead of getting the same tapas, we decided to try eight different tapas - some cold, some hot, some meat, and some seafood.  For the cold tapa, we ordered the Jamon Serrano and Queso Manchego, which consisted of salty serrano ham and four slices of tasty manchego cheese finished with olive oil drizzle and finely grated herbs.  For the hot tapa, we shared the Espinacas Con Naranjas,Tortilla Espanola, and Papas Fritas. The Espinacas Con Naranjas consisted of spinach sauteed with onions, oranges, toasted almonds, and raisins. It was fresh, sweet and savory. The Tortilla Espanola consisted of a thin spanish omelette stuffed with caramelized onions and diced potatoes. The Papas Fritas consisted of crispy deep fried potatoes served in a mildly spicy aioli tomato sauce and topped with a garlic aioli. I liked how every bite was garlicky with a slight kick.  For the meat tapas, we shared the Pollo A La Parilla, Carne A La Parilla, and Chorizo Salteado. The Pollo a la Parilla consisted of two grilled chicken thighs cooked with green olives and mushrooms in a salty brown sauce. I liked how the chicken was one-sided, tender, and had a chargrilled flavor. The Carne A La Parrilla consisted of a piece of grilled NY steak topped with a light cabrales sauce mixed with the au jus and garnished with finely grated herbs. The Chorizo Salteado consisted of spanish sausage sauteed with garlic, crushed tomato, and red wine sauce. It was served in olive oil. I liked how the chorizo had a smoky flavor.  For the seafood tapa,  we ordered the Salmon, which consisted of a grilled salmon on a bed of crushed tomatoes cooked with capers, thyme, and roasted garlic. The salmon was fresh and cooked to perfection. I like how the tomatoes had a smoky flavor but I didn't like how they were so tart. Next time, I'd like to try the Octopus and Fried Calamari.  We finished our meal on a sweet note, with a slice of Tres Leches Cake, a moist, not too dense sponge cake soaked in milk, frosted with fresh whipped cream, and served with sliced fresh strawberries.",

Food was pretty great overall, but I was not too impressed their Lomo de puerco dish (grilled pork loin with brandy pineapple sauce). The dishes I really enjoyed were their Ensalada de espinacas con camarones (spinach salad with grilled shrimp) and Tortilla con chorizo (Spanish omelet with Spanish sausage). I could not believe how fresh their salad vegetables were and the Spanish sausage omelet was both a delicacy and nice comfort food. Food is not the most authentic Spanish/latin fusion as it is a bit more americanized.  There was nothing wrong with our server - I was simply expecting more due to the high bar that has been set by other restaurants in Bethesda and similar tapas places. I noticed that they have some good deals for their happy hour and I will be returning to take advantage of it for sure.",

Had to asked multiple times for water and cutlery along with long waits to get the things we requested. Though the staff were nice, but it was hard to track them down!  Ordered the Calamares Fritos and the Carne a La Parrilla. The calamari was a good portion for the price and was crispy. Also, it was not salty (which is a good thing to me) at all so the dipping sauce definitely came in handy. Though it was a bit too chewy for calamari- either a bit overcooked or the quality wasn't there compared to other places were it would be very soft and less chewing needed. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and had a good fat to meat ratio.  Also, the steak and the roasted vegs and mashed potatoes portion was decently sized for the price.",
