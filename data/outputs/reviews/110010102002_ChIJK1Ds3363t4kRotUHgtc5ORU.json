And the thing is amazing. The same $5 as the salad, which is still wonderful, but I was in total foodgasm mode the entire time I was eating it which my companion can attest to. So I absolutely plan to come back and I will have to really think about whether I still want salads or whether I want this. Oh and also! They will now sell you a bag of just falafels for three bucks. Which was perfect, for snacking, and for introducing my companion to falafels being someone different from just chickpeas. He approves us both the falafels and the shawarma ;)  (My current problem is that I'm sitting here very very tempted to eat more fries or falafel but I am entirely too full. That's shawarma was really filling!)  PS: the photo of the sandwich is about 2/3 through eating it what I was able to focus on something other than eating it and remembered I wanted to take a picture",

Seriously amazing prices and food! Perfect to grab and sit down on the water area. You cannot beat the quality and quantity for that cheap! Perfect for vegetarians/vegans. You can add hummus to your bowl for a little extra. Everything's great! Def a must if you're in the area and don't eat fish lol!",

I also requested no tabbouleh as I am gluten free. The person at the counter initially complied but was then extremely rude when I asked for an extra spoonful of hummus. I pointed out that I was not receiving falafel or tabbouleh and asked for substitution of extra humus instead. The counter person suggested I go buy a tub of hummus if I wanted more and then told me he doesn't do customizations. I was already holding the bowl in my hands and had paid for it. He offered to refund my money rather than accommodating a customer by spooning in an additional dollop of hummus. I cant tell you about the quality of the falafel, but the fries were excellent. I must say- and this is not sour grapes- the hummus was not good quality. I eat LOTS of hummus and this was watery and weak. So, I guess I was better off that the rude counter person didn't accommodate my request.",

This one didn't have a line though which was great (might have had to do with the dreary weather when I went), and I walked right in, gave my order, paid, and got my food basically instantaneously. The downside of this though is that the falafels aren't fresh right out of the fryer, and mine tasted a bit stale. They weren't crispy nor light like the ones I had at the one in Georgetown. I was quite disappointed actually because they were so good before. They have all the sauces still though at this location which is good. There's no seating inside but there are umbrellas and tables to stand at outside! Also, I have no idea how they make profit because the food is so cheap; my bowl was $4.40 including tax!",

I ordered three bowls for us to share and promptly dropped one as soon as I walked out the door. The manager saw what happened and personally remade one for me, even though it was clearly my own clumsy fault and he didn't have to do that. My kids were hungry from a long day of walking around and sight seeing, so we definitely appreciated his awesome gesture. Great customer service, and the food was wonderful too. Highly recommend.",

They added numerous sauces and veggie items (a zingy red cabbage, a pungeant pickled item and more). The falafel balls were delicious. There were several crispy pita chips. Everything about this was tasty. It was so flavorful- maybe a little too flavorful (but I won\u2019t ding them for that- just be advised- if you\u2019re sensitive to spicy flavors or pickled items, then ask to have those items held off). This is a small shop, good for taking something to go and eating out on the wharf or at home. Next time I\u2019ll try the sandwich with the pita. Also, the prices are unbeatable. I told the guy the place is underpriced and they could easily charge double.",
