When we made the reservation it asked if we were celebrating anything and we marked yes to anniversary. When we were seated the table was set for 4. Two of the place settings were picked up and the server did not mention our anniversary or ask if we were celebrating anything or even ask if we had been to the restaurant before (we hadn't). When we ordered drinks they took about 10-12 minutes to come out and when they did one of them was not what we ordered. We also had an appetizer and entree set onto our table that was not what we ordered that the server removed and brought to another table. We were only asked how our food was once and it was before we even had time to take a bite. The food was fantastic, but the service was not at all what we expected for a $$$$ ($166) meal to celebrate our first anniversary. Overall, we were pretty disappointed with our experience and will not recommend Cotton Row to our local friends.",

So we go in and notice that it is a nice dressy restaurant, but, we were hungry and tired so we went in anyways. Our service? It was HORRIBLE. And I\u2019m not sure if it was because we were dressed in jeans and boots or that we are young \u201ckids\u201d (were 25) or that we weren\u2019t drinking that night. Or maybe it was a little bit of all three. Our waitress? Well she let us sit for 30 minutes before she even asked what we wanted to drink. She would go to the table right next to us 3-4 times before she ever thought of coming to us. She never checked on us and NEVER refilled our glasses. I wanted to order desert but honestly I didn\u2019t want to wait another 45 minutes for her to come over to us. What makes me so mad is the name of this place is cotton row, she probably has no idea what a cotton row is and obviously has no respect for a cotton farmer, the one who is the reason for the clothes on her back. She judged a book by its cover and let me tell you, my money is green just like everyone else\u2019s and if I am going to spend that much money on a dinner I expect it to be worth it.",

My husband made the reservations for August 27, 2020 and since someone reserved the entire first floor we were seated on the second floor in private dining which was a cozy and beautiful area.  I\u2019ll start with the positives and that is our dinners were delicious and our cocktails were perfect! Upon arriving the man that greeted us and took us to our table was very friendly, made us feel welcome and wished me a Happy Birthday.  My husband ordered \u201cSeared Cape Cod Sea Scallops\u201d and I ordered \u201cThe Alaskan Halibut.\u201d The scallops were seared to perfection & flavorful. The halibut was a very moist, delicious piece of fish served with perfectly cooked risotto. Again 5+++ stars to the chef & mixologist!  The downside was our service. Once we were seated our server Christian came up to the table handed us our menus and asked if we wanted drinks. There was not a friendly \u201cHi\u201d or a casual conversation to start our dinner off. I mentioned my husband brought me there for my birthday and we were excited to try Cotton Row for the first time. He stared blankly at me with his mask on. He said he\u2019d be back to take our drink orders.  The tone was set which also kept our ordering to a minimum. We were looking forward to a before dinner drink, appetizers, soup or salad and a dinner drink with our entrees. What we did instead was order one drink each and our entrees.  Our server did not recommend or suggest any appetizers, he did not let us know about any specialty entrees and pretty much was there to do the basics of his job which he did. To take a quote from J. Peterman from Seinfeld  \u201cJob done.\u201d  We have been trying more restaurants in our hometown (23+ years) of Madison County since COVID19 hit otherwise we usually spend special occasions such as birthdays and our anniversary in downtown Nashville dining at The Southern or The Farmhouse. The service was a 180 of what we are used to at a high end restaurant.  On a final note, the food can be the best of the best but if your servers that represent your chefs and their wonderfully prepared meals don\u2019t care than it will prevent repeat business.",

Nothing overpowered the scallops, as it should be. I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. Broccolini crisp tender. The sauce was silky, great complement to the fillet. The potatoes gratin was amazing - creamy, cheesy, tender potatoes. We each ate half the plate and switched - surf/turf.  Dessert was an outstanding creme brulee.

Started with the Fois Gras appetizer.  Filet mignon for me and scallops for her.  We told our server we were going to share the entrees, so the kitchen split the filet and scallops, the lobster mac and cheese, and the asparagus and gnocchi on two plates without us even having to ask.  Filet was ordered med rare..it was perfect all the way through.  Scallops were perfectly seared on one side to keep the tenderness through.  Lobster mac and cheese is delish.  Dessert was molten lava cake with ice cream.  The only thing that make Hy's better was the tableside chocolate fruit flambe.  My dry vodka martini was perfect.  I don't know how you could do it any better.  The staff at Cotton Row and the owner should be proud of their craft in such an unassuming location in a little city in North Alabama.  I couldn't stop talking about it while drinking IPA at a small brewery down the street.  Every penny was worth it.",

I took my wife here for our anniversary dinner and was definitely let down.  The service was definitely the worst thing about this place. After being sat it took about 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by anyone and another 10 before coming over to take our drink orders. Our server never introduced herself, just asked if we knew what we wanted without providing any insight on the menu. Our  cocktails were served to us by another server before we got our waters. Service was like this throughout the entire dining experience, different people would drop off food but nobody came by to fill our waters or get us new drinks.  The food was better than an average chain restaurant, but for the price definitely not worth it. I will say my scallops were perfectly seared but lacked flavor and weren't garnished with any kind of fresh herbs. My wifes steak was cooked to temp and was easily the best thing either of us ordered. The cheese plate was okay, there was a lot of fruits and veggies and not a lot of meat and cheese. If this food came from an outback or something like that I would be impressed but its not fine dining quality for sure.  The decor here was super cool. It had a bunch of stuff from when it used to be a bank and they even kept the vault door. Dim lights, nice ambience made for a very intimate setting.  At the end of the night our bill was around 150 for 2 dinners, an app, and 3 drinks. I'm glad I got to check this place out, but in my opinion it's not worth the price. Especially for how bad the service was.",

The lobster ravioli was good but only 4 ravioli, the fried green tomato benedict was good and a nice portion.  They have a nice wine menu and if they are out of the by the glass they will upgrade you.   We liked the relaxed meal but they don't attend to water or clearing of plates.   Skip the desert, I was looking forward to the lemon chiffon cake but I got a cold dense cake right out of the refrigerator.  Nothing light and airy about it.   The frosting was hard as a rock.  The ice cream with the chocolate crunch cake was delicious.  If you limit your choices you won't be disappointed.",

For a main I chose the deep sea scallops on greens and they were flawless! A crispy sear on the outside contained a perfectly cooked interior, not an easy task for a chef to accomplish. For dessert I chose a classic, creme brulee, and it didn't disappoint. The custard interior had a delicate kiss of vanilla and the carmelized sugar crust was perfect. Paired with an affogado, it was a nice ending to an wonderful meal. Reservations are definitely recommended.",

The sandwich arrived towering with onion rings and the steak had a poached egg and an amazing sauce. The meats were both cooked to perfection. (I want more of that sauce) My only critique was my fries were plain. They tasted just like the other fries. Our server brought me more truffle oil and shredded parmesan cheese. ( This must have been inexpensive truffle oil because it did not have the kick of truffles that I expected) All in all, nice quiet atmosphere and cute dining area.",

My husband ordered short ribs but we think they gave him a half fist sized piece of pot roast for $30 since not a rib was to be seen. Had to ask for a black napkin for my black pants 4 times. We were there at 5pm when there were many empty tables so don't understand the service issue. Wonder what prime time is like?",

I made reservations for New Years Eve and looked forward to having a nice dinner with my wife and son whom I miss very much.  We show up at the appropriate time and they tell us that our table isn't ready, so we had to wait for almost half an hour. There was no place to sit down so we just had to stand in a little corner by the hostess stand.  Finally after almost 30 minutes, the hostess took us to our table, which was upstairs. Strangely, she took us through the back through the kitchen itself and then walked us outside in the rain to a staircase to get to our table in a completely different section of the restaurant. I found this odd.  After we were seated, it took about 15 minutes for the server to bring us some water when there were only a few other guests sitting around us in the upstairs section of the restaurant. At this point I've been in the restaurant for almost an hour and all I've had given to me is one glass of water. I'm starting to get very irritated and my young son is starting to get antsy. This is not how I envisioned our New Years Eve meal to go down.  The server finally takes our order. I ordered the filet mignon (ordered to be cooked medium) and lobster tail a for me and my son and my wife got the chicken.  Again, we waited almost 35 minutes for our food to arrive, we saw our tray with our food sitting on a counter to be picked up. We watched as it sat there for about 15 minutes with no one bothering to deliver it to our table. We watched as many servers passed by it without looking.  At this point we've been in the restaurant for about an hour and fifteen minutes. When we got our food it was COMPLETELY cold and wasn't cooked like I asked. My wife's chicken was so dry that she could not eat it. It was like chewing sawdust.  I asked to speak to the manager.  I expressed my displeasure to the manager and she made the situation right and comped our meal.  The kitchen cooked our meals for the second time and got it right. From entering the restaurant to getting our correct meal took over two hours.  The couple that was sitting at the table next to us also had problems with their food and had to send it back as well. The gentleman that spoke to the manager was not pleased. He got cold food as well.  I'm glad that Cotton Row comped our meal, but I would have had no problem paying for it if it was done right the first time.",

It is as if they took chain quality food like Steak Out, McDonalds, and Red Robin, cut the portions in half, slapped it on a plate with a garnish and then called it \"gourmet.\" This is the epitome of gentrification. Then, we get to the taste of the food. Oh. My. God. I would rather lick a toilet than take another bite of food from this place. Absolutely disgusting -- it's as if the cook has never heard of a seasoning...and salt doesn't count!  Beyond the food and price though is the people. These are some of the most classless, pseudo-snobs I have ever met. Of course at a place that essentially is asking you to pay $40 for a 2oz hunk of dirt, what can you really expect?  Save your money and eat some cardboard in a Waffle House parking lot and you'll have a more fulfilling experience.",

Got reservations for my beautiful significant others Birthday and we were looking so forward to the experience. The drinks from the bar were good and the initial service was acceptable.  However,  the food service was very slow and spotty. I had to ask for water refills numerous times (even after I told our waiter I liked a lot of water with my meal). The food was varying from excellent to gosh what's this? The steak was very salty though tasty. What's more I called the restaurant prior and arranged for a champagne toast for my lovely lady...never received nor mentioned by our waiter.  So all in all we both agreed that the visit was our last.",

We were seated ahead of the time they initially stated and both hosts were friendly and welcoming. The wine menu is very good with something for every taste and price point. The beet salad was delicious as was my duck, which was prepared perfectly. The filet mignon was perfectly prepared and cut like butter. Bread pudding for dessert was tasty albeit a small portion (for me). And we had a French press coffee to close out the night. Oddly enough they didn\u2019t leave the French press on the table but after some cajoling they did. The service here is impeccable, you can tell the entire staff is well trained.",

I verified that fact the evening before our planned visit and was told that we would be seated at the requested table. When we arrived (on time!) another party was seated at that table and we were escorted back to string of 4 tables along the wall. This was unacceptable for us because we could not hear each other to visit together. The food was good, the wait staff courteous and efficient, but the fact that the Cotton Row did not honor our reservations makes me uncomfortable in going there again.

        "caption": "So I initially gave this review a 3-star, but was convinced by my boyfriend to give them a 4-star . . . Here is why.  This was my first visit to Huntsville, Alabama. I spent quite some time trying to contemplate on where to eat at. I usually like to go to chains for the reason of consistency in quality of food, taste of food, and service (which makes my overall experience). However, today I decided to go with trying something new.  The menu really caught my eye when browsing online. I must say the food was absolutely delicious! The presentation of the food was absolutely beautiful and everything was extremely tasty and delicious!  The service I received was excellent as well! My waiter checked on me constantly to make sure I was okay and even made suggestions. When he heard that I was visiting from out of town, he also made recommendations on their other three restaurants to try during my trip. He was extremely attentive and very nice.  My overall impression of the restaurant was very good. I like the presentation, ambience was very upscale and classy. They also have valet parking in the front as well as street parking. I'm assuming they validate and the waiter made a great effort to ask every single table if they needed to be validated, which was great because I always forget and have to walk back later to ask for validation after I leave.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I definitely give this restaurant a 10 as far as quality of food, and taste. My only complaint was the portion size. (That is the only reason why I initially gave it a 3, rather than 4 Star.) I didn't order an appetizer because I normally get full off the bread LOL I only had my entree I ordered the diver scallops. I also ordered my creme brulee dessert. With those two items I was just about almost full (that tells you how little I eat, but once again \"just about\" full.) The entree only came with 3 scallops that were about larger than half dollar size coin and served over zucchini pasta and mushrooms, which I felt was barely a side serving in itself. If I had not ordered the creme brulee dessert I definitely would have been still hungry and also I had two cocktail drinks to fill me up. Definitely for a grown man or someone with a bigger appetite I would say the portion size is very EXTREMELY small. My entree would be considered an appetizer in most restaurants. I spent about\u00a0$70\u00a0plus tip for two drinks, and entree, and creme brulee.  I definitely would dine at this restaurant again for the ambiance and the service but if you are looking for a meal to fill you up, you will be spending a pretty penny. To be honest I could have ordered two of the diver scallops entrees and that would have been a full meal for me, and I don't eat a lot! For the price that you were paying, I felt like the value was not there, and after spending $70 to leave there not absolutely sure if I was full or not is not something I'm used to LOL nonetheless I had a wonderful experience and a great time. Like I said, I would definitely be back.",

We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation near the front of the restaurant next to a big group who were very loud.  This group in addition to the music playing over the speakers made the ambient noise level near unbearable.  We ordered the Spanish Charred Octopus, and I realize octopus can be hard to cook and if done incorrectly it would be like eating an inner tube, well that was how this octopus was....an inner tube.  I had the seared diver scallops and the first one I bit into was also very chewy...a sign that the scallop had been cooked too long.  The other four scallops were fine.  Wife had the beef short ribs and they were fine and in fact tasted like a pot roast.  We had heard rave reviews about Cotton Row and having experienced it ourselves we are totally undecided about returning.  Hopefully Huntsville gets more upscale dining establishments as competition is a great thing to drive better dining experiences.",

While we were led out of the restaurant like panhandlers when we got there, we were taken around the corner down the street and upstairs to a very nice private room with its own restroom. It was great.  As for the food, I personally thought that everything I had was Fantastic from the cocktails (Rocket Science), to the appetizers (ravioli,dumplings,octopus), to the soup (butternut squash), the salad (fennel, apple, citrus), the entree (seafood paella) , and the desert (apple tart).  I would give it 5 stars except, that I wasn't the only one eating.  Three of party had steaks.  None liked them--too bland, no flavor.  My advice is don't order a steak at a non-steak place.  There was also a problem with ordering the wine.  It took 4 tries before they could find one that they actually had on their wine menu (4 tries!).  The wine we eventually got, was fine.  I would highly recommend it, just don't order a steak and pick the house wine.",
