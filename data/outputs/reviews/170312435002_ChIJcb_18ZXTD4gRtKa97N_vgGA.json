The flavors and seasoning is a 10/10 but be careful if you tend to eat things mild because this place is on the spicier side. This is the 5th place I have recently ordered indian from in Chicago and I cannot articulate how superior this place was in comparison. (Even when compared to old favorites like cumin) I picked a random dish today like the vegetable okra entree and it was such a delightful surprise - loaded with flavor and texture. Really surprised to see this place not have way higher reviews. They brought some grandma's in the kitchen tonight. <3",

I\u2019m always on the lookout for new Indian restaurants to try so I was excited to Art of Indian Curry as a new option. I went with my staple - Chicken Tikka with garlic naan - and it did not disappoint! The veggies in the curry were an unexpected but welcome surprise and the naan was delicious. Definitely would recommend! I\u2019ll be ordering from here again for sure.",
