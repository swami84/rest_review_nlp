We found this location and had hoped to walk in, place an order and sit down to eat. Unfortunately, there are no tables in the location, so that was our only downside. We ended up sitting on the stairs of a neighboring business that was already closed for the day. We ordered two stromboli's and a small cheese pizza. The stromboli is huge, and likely to be a something you'd split between two people. My nephew polished off his pizza in one sitting, while my dad and I split our stromboli's into two meals each. The crust and sauce are fantastic, as well as the cheese. Overall, good enough we decided to split a large pizza for our last night here, delivery this time!",

When she came into the office today she let me know that there was a piece of metal in her pizza (yikes). It looks like the piece in the middle of a pizza roller. I called to get a refund and got the run around about it being too late/not their fault/you're lying. A driver came to pick up the leftover pizza (There were four people at the meeting and only a few slices left). I handed over the piece of metal and my receipt. The driver laughed in my face and drove away. The manager called me back, insinuated I was lying and said he would call me back. It shouldn't be this hard to get a $26 refund. I'll update my review if I get a refund...",

After putting me on hold for 5 min I hung up and called back and finally he told me he was sending me another one , it took the pizza a hour to get here. This is the worst customer service I ever experienced and you should not have workers working that is rushing and forget to cut a pizza. A pizza Is meant to be CUT!!!!!!!! I will never order from here again. I am a manger myself and I know the steps that are suppose to be taking when a order is messed up. You ask for a refund, new pizza etc he did None of that get it together!!!!! Then the pizza they sent was uncooked . I WANT AND DESERVE A REFUND",

We did order online, my preference all of the time because nothing can be misunderstood or interpreted incorrectly. I guess I have been proven wrong.
