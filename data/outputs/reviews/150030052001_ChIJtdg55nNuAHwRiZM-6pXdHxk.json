        "caption": "Once upon a time... Hometown Noodle Factory used to produce tasty and artisan-crafted Chinese noodles. However, the owner (Jun Lai Liang) had changed his business model to produce soybean products.  Currently, he focuses on just soybean products such as fresh soybean milk and silken tofu pudding or doufuhua (\u8c46\u8150\u82b1).  He sells his products in different sized containers which he displays atop a counter for you to decide what portion size you want.  When you purchase the silken tofu pudding, he'll also give you a small container of house made ginger syrup, complete with mashed ginger fibers and a spoon for you to dig into your warm tofu pudding.  Bear in mind, when you purchase the soybean product(s), it/they will be warm.  Most people eat their silken tofu pudding warm but to me, I prefer to eat it chilled.  Current price of 16 oz of tofu pudding is $3.75 and 1 quart of soybean milk costs $4.50.  Cash is preferred.  Business hours:  Daily, starting at 8:30AM or 9:00AM (depends upon amount he's making) UNTIL all is sold out.  He does have another job so this stall is generally open in the mornings only.  NOTE:  Because he\u2019s a one-man shop, Mr. Liang may open or close randomly.",
