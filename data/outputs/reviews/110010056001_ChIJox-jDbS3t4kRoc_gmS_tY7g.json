I would likely have given it four stars in a mid-price point, but here it's just three.  The staff was quite lovely.  The food was not hot, but merely warm.  None of the flavors were particularly complex or impressive, and the most memorable were the duck for having too much vinegar and the chocolate and cherry mousse for tasting like a children's chewable cherry Tylenol.  This restaurant gave me the impression of having been quite the thing ten or twenty years ago, and you could safely take your older parents/grandparents here and they would be delighted.  But I'd choose somewhere else for me.",

Take out is fine but can\u2019t replace that luxurious feeling that a very professional staff (both front- and back-of-house) will see to it as a duty that you have a lovely and memorable evening. Our party arrived for the early dining option and was seated at a table laid just for us. We chose the outdoor seating and the space was charming and comfortable. The jaunty Veuve Cliquot umbrellas were cheery and helped give the space an intimate feel. Attractive fire pits and large propane heaters kept us warm and cozy. Vinnie and staff took excellent care of us throughout the meal. After months of take out cartons, we nearly swooned over the truffle-topped amuse bouche. Thank you, Chef! Every dish and every course was delightful and spot-on. My advice: if you are feeling down and tiring of this slog to the other side of the pandemic, treat yourself and your loved-ones to a wonderful evening of being cosseted and fed a succession of delights.",

It was not packed when we got there, but later in the meal we were told that tomorrow, Christmas Eve would be terrible and we were thanked for eating now rather than tomorrow.  Food was spectacular, in particar the Venison Chop with Huckleberry sauce.  Service was impeccable; water re-filled within 2 minutes, chitchat with the Sommelier and waitstaff was pleasant and they were even humming along to the festive music, a cute plus.  I wholeheartedly reccommend Marcel's to any who have a finer taste for food, as well as those who are curious as to what a step up in the culinary world entails, as every menu item was masterfully described to us when we had questions.

Joanthan perfectly paired three wines with our courses, and throughout the evening provided a masterful blend of information, humor, and service. Tom Sietsema ranks Marcel's in his DC Restaurant Hall of Fame. Chef Robert and his staff richly deserve this ranking. We look forward to our next dining experience at Marcel's.",

We asked our concierge at the Regis if business casual was appropriate attire and they said that they had never heard of  Marcels but that our attire (open-collar button ups and dress pants) should be more than sufficient for any establishment. The help at the restaurant seemed like we dressed up enough, but I would have felt more comfortable in a jacket. The food and drink, however, was just not that great. We ordered a bottle of wine, and when they brought it out, we found out it was a screw-off cap bottle! Not a corked wine.... and the food was just as mundane. The first couple courses were small, which is to be expected, but they were also just not exciting or stimulating. We all got room-temperature scallops on the fourth course and that was the last straw. Our bill was 600 for three people, and they did add gratuity to the bill (which was also expected). We left, and they had their driver take us to a second much cheaper and better restaurant. I think this place just puts too much of their \u201cbrand\u201d into the pretentious atmosphere they have going on. In the end, it\u2019s really just not that impressive.",

Soft shell crab was overly battered and greasy and tasted like fried food and not at all like crab. The halibut was a small dry salty piece of fish that again, had very little fish flavor because the salt, infused into the fish, was so overwhelming. My dessert was a small piece of blue cheese with some tiny accompaniments which were interesting but did not warrant the price tag of the meal. Overall, I was completely disappointed. Because I was with friends who are very taken with the restaurant, I was not able to speak up and offer my observations. I think my relationship with Marcel\u2019s is over.  over.",

However for a regular guy taking his mom for a special birthday dinner, we had a great time.  Food was great (most recommend the scallops! To die for).  Service was excellent (very patient with my family and I who are very new to fine dining).  Seating was nice with a classy and elegant ambiance.  To answer some questions: valet parking is $15  Not to busy, not overly crowded but conversations are difficult to keep within your table. I definitely was able to listen to others conversation no matter how quiet they were. This didnt bother me or my family but may bother someone else.",

I think they had a remodel and some changes since them based on my recollection of the 2012 experience.  For the price and reputation, we were packed in like sardines on top of other couples. That particular atmosphere takes away from the 3.5 hour experience.  You can't have private conversation and you just have everyone else looking at your table as dishes slowly come out... or you are looking at them.  Essentially what this does for the chef's tasting menu the element of surprise is taken away as you see what the other couples are eating who may be an hour or so in front of you.  We felt ignored at times - waiter didn't ask for drink orders for a while.  Had to pull teeth for attention.  Different waiters would provide the dish...might not get the full description when they place it front of you.  The food was just OK and the service was OK at best. The salmon roe amuse-bouche was really good. That was the best thing of the evening.  The lobster first course with caviar was A+.  It went downhill after that though.  The venison was over seasoned. The lamb was over cooked.  Over all, I am forgetting a couple courses just a couple days later so that should tell you something. Not positive memories.  The experience in 2012 was much better. The pumpkin dessert was just bad.  I won't be back.",

The\u00a0amuse-bouch\u00a0was a watermelon and strawberry gazpacho.\u00a0 It was refreshing, delicious and a very nice fusion of flavors.\u00a0 Perfect for summer!  Both times I enjoyed the pan-seared scallops for the\u00a0appetizer.\u00a0 They are juicy, perfectly seared, the flavor of the sauce is light and well-balanced.  I have enjoyed two\u00a0entrees\u00a0and both were AMAZING!\u00a0 If you love beef and it is your first time dining here, please (PLEASE) order the slow cooked short ribs.\u00a0 They are slow cooked half of the day, they are fork tender and melt in your mouth with each bite.\u00a0 The second entr\u00e9e I enjoyed was the pan roasted farm chicken with potato cake and tarragon beurre blanc sauce. Also, delicious.\u00a0 The chicken was juicy and the sauce was simply amazing.\u00a0 I also really enjoyed the potato cake.\u00a0 I use left over mashed potatoes to make potato cakes and I thought I did a great job with purple onions, salt, papper and white cheddar. But this potato cake was powerfully flavored with scallions and gruyere cheese.\u00a0 Oh, ok \u2026 I know how I am making my potato cakes next time!  I have also enjoyed two\u00a0dessert\u00a0options and I really enjoyed them both as they were quite different \u2013 sweet vs savory.\u00a0 My first visit I enjoyed the marjolaine of hazelnut daquiose with white coffee gelato and praline cream.\u00a0 It was decadent and just enough.\u00a0 During my second visit, I ordered a cheese plate (north sea gouda, semi hard) which came with macadamia nuts and a honey comb. \u00a0Also, very nice. \u00a0I enjoyed both desserts with a glass of prosecco.  Finally, as a palette cleanser, I was served a small cracker with pistachio cream and blueberry.\u00a0 Who knew those flavors went so well together!\u00a0 It was the perfect ending to a great meal.",

From the friendly hostess, the knowledgeable server, the food and pairing recommendations, to Robert himself coming to serve us one of our dishes, we have never experienced hospitality like this in the city. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, the staff arranged a car service to the Kennedy Center after our meal. The whole experience is like having everything go your way. Ever have one of those days? Well, go to Marcel\u2019s, and you absolutely will.",

The restaurant doesn't seem to get busy until maybe 8 or 8:30 but even when it was busy the atmosphere was still very peaceful and you felt like you had privacy.  Also they had a pianist playing live music from time to time and it was amazing.  This a great experience for a special occasion I would recommend to anyone.",

The dining room is spacious, comfortable, and well-lit without being harsh (fantastic that you can actually see your food, since the presentation is so attractive).  I'd requested the pre-theater menu, which is a selection of 3 items for each of 3 courses plus the option to have a private car drive your party to the theater after dinner.  The menu was about 50% different from the sample theater menu posted on the website, but I had the exact same problem with both versions - I literally wanted to try every item on there.  Between our party of 4, we did order almost everything on the theater menu.  My friend thought her steak was a little too tough, but each other dish was an absolute rave from all of us (the duck confit was devastating).  Our wonderfully attentive waiter happened to be an excellent sommelier, and flawlessly selected wines for each course for those of us interested in doing so.  When we were done, a  town car was waiting out front to drop us off at the front door of the Kennedy Center, right on time for the show.  My partner asked to look at the full menu as well \"just to see,\" and we immediately decided we'd be back soon - again, everything sounds fantastic.   Highly recommended!",

        "caption": "Easily a 2 Michellin Star Restaurant!  I stumbled upon Marcel\u2019s by mistake. My wife and I had guest finished seeing a show at the Kennedy Center, and were looking for a place to eat. Being new to DC, I made a reservation at Jardenia, across the street from Marcel\u2019s.  As soon as we got to Jardenia, we were disappointed. It was hard to find a host, the chairs were incredibly comfortable, and the menu was boring. It was a disappointment after a fantastic evening of listening to great music. A quick google search and I found Marcel\u2019s across the street and was hoping they could squeeze us in.  I explained by plight to Jonathan, the very charismatic manager that greeted us, and he managed to find us a table. From the moment we sat down, everything was a delight. Jonathan sent us over a couple of glasses of excellent rose champagne and took the time to explain all the great choices on the menu.  The service was impeccable, and the food was absolutely superb. I consider myself a NYC food snob that often frequents Per se, Le Bernardin, Daniel, and Eleven Madison Park. Marcel\u2019s was as good than those restaurants, if not better, in many respects. The waiters were professional, the timing of the plating was on point, and the ambience was that great mix of old world serenity with modern touches.  The food was sublime, with a great mix of traditional and new flavors. My wife has the lobster bisque which was easily the best I have ever had and my scallops were seared to perfection. My lamb tenderloin was tender and succulent and my wife\u2019s fish was crispy and flavorful. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was the perfect topping to an amazing meal.  Jonathan was so hospitable, I told him that moving from Jardenia to Marcel\u2019s was like getting upgraded from the middle seat in United to British Airways First Class. The place was a delight and we will be back \u2013 a lot.",

Can't stand restaurants with gimmicky reservation open times (exhibit A: pinneapple and pearl) Or deposits for reservations  (exhibiy B: fiola). Marcel is pure delight, from reservation, to service, to special requests and of course the food. The menu changes regularly, but on our latest visit we loved everything we ordered. On our \"must-have\" list is mussels gratin, the venison, the dover sole, the panna cotta and the esspoise cheese. On our \"optional\" list is the sea bass, lamb triangles and lemon merengue. We noticed everyone ordered the Lobster bisque, must be good. The service, always impeccable, but my favorite part is the upbeat and helpful Jonathan who was the \"captain\" of service for our table. Adnan at the front of the house always goes above and beyond too. The ambiance, we have found, is quieter in the lower level... so thats where we like to sit.",

The menu was intriguing with items such as cantaloupe soup and hanger steak. Definitely worth trying out if you want to have a nice dinner.

I have been travelling all over the world and beleive me this restaurant is exag\u00e9ration of pricing for the quality. I took a ravioli with meat sauce,  only 8 pieces, so small,  but the price 45$. My wife took a small blueberry cake, for 22$. This is ridiculous. The menu is for a 5 to 7 courses, at $$$$, During our diner,  the host was always snobys us talking behind our back to their staff. Very bad atitude, I am telling you don't even go there.

For the money, of course we expected high quality of food which was not too bad (my wife rated the food higher than me; I think it was OK too, though not outstanding). At first we found that the waiter got a running nose and so he made some noise trying to breath in something in his nose. As time went, we found that he seemed to have forgot to refill water for us. My wife guessed that maybe he was not happy with my dressing since I did not wear a suit, just business casual for this top restaurant. But at least we were polite as usual to him. Then when I asked for the bill, he asked me if I want him to add 20% tips. What a blatant request! But I did pay 20% after-tax tips to indicate that I am not a mean person. I also usually pay 20% tips. Maybe he just look down at some people after figuring out some factors to look down? Anyway, it is just my guess and I am not sure about the reason. But I am pretty sure that he was quite rude by asking for 20% tips after even failing to refill water for a long time.",

Our reservation was for 10pm; we showed up on time, but the table needed setting.  (Odd - there were quite a few empty ones).  We then sat for 45 minutes before our order was taken, and a further 15 before any food was brought.  Once it started, though, it came at a perfect pace. (Oddly, the front-of-house manager had apparently noticed the delay when we spoke on the way out, but didn't do anything about it.)  Our waiter was friendly enough - especially towards the end, when there was only one other table.  The menu consists of 7 courses of 3 dishes apiece; you get to pick from 4 -7 dishes from anywhere on the menu.  This made it easy for a couple of us to skip over the seafood-heavy first few courses; we were offered the chance of asking for a replacement vegetarian dish, but didn't need it. With two exceptions (the watercress soup and pear salad were both very salty) the food was executed nearly flawlessly.  Nothing stood out as a \"wow\" (except perhaps four a couple of the desserts), but it was all exceedingly good.  Portions were perfectly sized.  The wine pairings were wonderful, and included the chance to replace them with something else if they weren't to our taste.  (We did this for one of 20 glasses).  We did have to ask explicitly for the wine pairings to be brought at the beginning, but things got better later on, and pours increased in size towards the later part of the meal.  It's not cheap: just under $800 for 4 people, each with 5 courses plus a 4-course wine pairing, including tip.  But it was a special occasion ...",

Wear a coat with deep pockets or carry a bag\u2026  so that you can take with you a couple of your favorite sandwiches, hot dogs, wraps, or whatever you like to eat when you are hungry.  You will be glad you did.  The meal philosophy at Marcel\u2019s consists in offering a meal of up to 7 courses, each a meager portion, in the hope that it adds up to a decent meal, though they aim mostly at dazzling you with the sophistication of the food.  I thought that sort of dining experience had died with the nouvelle cuisine fad of the 80s and 90s, but it lives on at Marcel\u2019s.  Each course menu description is a sonnet that promises untold delights.  When the food arrives, however, you see a few morsels over patches of colorful sauces and garnish so artfully presented that it compels you to take a picture of the dish before daring to touch it, almost.  A qualification is in order.  We live in the US but we were born and raised in Europe.  It means that when waiters usually place a family-size food tray trying to pass for an individual portion in front of us, we do not appreciate the excess, or the implication that we might be wolves.  On the other hand, I have eaten lots of hearty meals in France, and nobody should ever think that Marcel\u2019s food is how the French well-to-do eat.  They serve ridiculously small portions, no exaggeration.  My foie-gras course ($36) was the size of a matchbox, a couple of polite mouthfuls at best.  Now this style of dining would have a chance if when you finish the few mouthfuls of each course, the next was on its way, but no; the intercourse wait was a painful 10-15 minutes, and there were six on schedule.  The food tastes very good and tantalizes you, but then you have to sit wanting for more what feels like a long time.  I asked the waiter if he could shorten the wait between courses, and he said he would ask the chef, but it was still a good ten minutes wait in between courses for the rest of the meal.   At the start of the meal a waiter brought five diminutive bread rolls and a plate with ovals of butter, each an extraordinary elaboration the size of an olive.  A magnifying glass would have come in handy.  If an avid restaurant manager or head-waiter were to keep the courses coming with a short wait between them the meal experience could improve substantially, but as it turn out it was a mighty annoyance.  We went to Marcel for our 10th anniversary, and instead of a memorable meal we had a memorable joke.  At least we can laugh about it.  One of my dishes was cold on arrival, and one of my wife\u2019s dishes was much too salty. They deducted the cost of those and they gave me a free Sambuca, and the waiter did ask what he could do to salvage our meal experience, so he gets kudos for that, unfortunately, the mix of the restaurant philosophy and its bad implementation, limits what any waiter can do to compensate. We were going for the full 7-course meal but as we saw the miniature dessert and cheese courses other people ordered, we decided to cut it short and had just a 4-course meal.  I still paid over $200, for just the two of us, even with deductions and only two glasses of wine.  So it was a very expensive joke.  I don\u2019t mind the cost so much it they give us a splendid dinner, but that was not it, and I wonder how this restaurant can survive in the US, with such hilariously small portions and the couple of hours that it takes to actually get the food on the table.  It shall remain a mystery, but I know that a New York style hot-dog stand nearby would have very good prospects.",

As soon as we stepped through the doors, we were greeted with a warm welcome.   The atmosphere is classic but by no means stuffy.  Since we arrived a little early, we decided to have cocktails at the bar in the comfortable and inviting lounge.   Fantastic martinis!   All of the staff were impeccably dressed, energetic and charming.   Adnane, the Maitre D' was so gracious and greeted us with his congratulations and escorted us to our very special table.  During the evening, he came over a number of times to make sure everything was perfect, and it was.   Jonathan (Senior Captain) took our orders.   He was delightfully engaging, informative and fun!   The food was so wonderful...beautiful presentations, every morsel scrumptious.  Paul, the chef, is fantastic and he even took the time to extend his good wishes as well.   The service was first rate and the kindnesses extended to us were generous and genuine.  Thanks to all the staff at Marcel's for making our 50th wedding anniversary unforgettable.  We can't wait to return!",
