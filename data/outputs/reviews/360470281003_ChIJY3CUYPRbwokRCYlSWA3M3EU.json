After 2 hours and my tracker still saying \"Timothy began preparing your order at 4:01\" I decided to give them a call and was on hold for 30 minutes before the roboassistant hung up. I placed my order at 4:02PM today 4//13/2020 and it is now 7:04pm when I post it. Upon looking at Dominos site I see that they're \"no longer taking delivery orders\". I will report this and have it removed from my credit card. This place is 15 minutes from me and probably the worst experience I've had with a restaurant ever. Can't even report an issue through tracker because the order hasn't left the store.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT.",

We called back a few times and would be hung up on before even being able to talk to anyone, are you kidding me?! Then we called from a different number and they just left the phone on hold for 15 minutes. They told us that \u201cthere is no order or pizza\u201d which made no sense, and they hung up on us before we could explain anything. Then we did the good old *67 trick, wow they answered without hanging up! We calmly told them our dipping sauce was missing and there was no sauce on our pizza yet again, and you guessed it! - they hung up. This is how you run a business?? I tried *67 one more time for good measure because at this point I\u2019m getting seriously frustrated but I guess they\u2019ve figured out my tactic and immediately hang up the phone. I know there are greater issues in the world than missing dipping sauce and actual sauce on a pizza, but to just have a professional interaction would have gone a long way...this place is an absolute disgrace!! Zero stars. I cant imagine the owner of this franchise would be impressed by how this place is being run. Don\u2019t test your sanity by ordering from here, run far far away.",

All of my worries most of been true because when I came out my bike... was gone. However, I asked Dominoes for their assistance and they just gave me some simple good-for-nothing answer. This was the worst experience of my life that block is full of criminals who wouldn't have a single doubt to steal something if it meant their own selfish benefit. This happened in 886 Dekalb Av. I just have a message to all the thieves, there are many people who are hardworking in everything they do. For example, I am a hardworking students heading to High school, however although I work hard I still have hobbies. And today one of those hobbies was taken from me like candy from a kid. All in all, I'm never nearing that place again and if I do don't think I'll be caught off guard.",

The next day (after I ordered from somewhere else) I called a few more times and someone actually hung up on me.  I went to the store and they told me they had cancelled my order, without ever bothering to tell me, because they were understaffed.  The store was in a state of chaos and everything was pretty nasty so I elected to try to get a refund as opposed to another pizza.  I've attached some pics I took.  This place is pretty unsanitary.

So tonight I had to walk to the store to finally be able to talk to someone about getting money back and was met with absolutely horrendous customer service.  The cashier told me that the money was already refunded, gave no receipt or further explanation, and then proceeded to tell me that they were \"too busy right now.\"  I still have no confirmation that the money was actually returned to my account.

After waiting for another 15 minutes on hold I hung up and I called back and the phone just kept ringing.  So then at 10:45pm I drove to the store only to be told that the delivery guy forgot something and had to come back to the store but he is on his way now. So then I asked how long will it be and the cashier called him and he then advised her that he had to come back to the store again because he gave away one of my items. The cashier then informs me that they are going to make a fresh pasta bowl for me (the item He gave Way) but while I was waiting for another 5 minutes the cashier began to have a little spat with one of the food preparers trying to explain to him that I am waiting and she asked for the pasta bowl to be made and it still isn\u2019t made.  At that point, I simply asked for a refund... the manger (also a food preparer) refunds my card then tells me that the machine ate my receipt so I had no proof.  To top off all of the above ... NOT ONE FOOD PREPARER WORE GLOVES! The entire back of house was dirty.  The same manager that came to refund my purchase touched the register with his hands and went right back to preparing food without sanitizing in any way.  Not to mention I observed the delivery man opening his orders to place condiments in the boxes (you guessed it) with no gloves.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER ORDER FROM DOMINOES  Lastly, I am two blocks away from this location! 2 hours later I had no food and my 5 year old son fell asleep in the middle of all of it and didn\u2019t get to eat.",

Long story short they never made it.And even though the tracker was moving that was just to make me think they were  doing something. If I would have never called I would have been waiting all night.  I walked away and went to get something else.This is by far the worst customer service I've ever seen .Completely  horrible.
