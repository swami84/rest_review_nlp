One day my two daughters and I were wandering the artist booths of The French Market, and decided we were hungry. We saw Nawlins and decided to give them a try. We ordered seafood gumbo, and the BBQ shrimp. Those shrimp were the highlight of our entire trip! We ended up walking to the market the next day to have another plate of those delicious shrimp before we had to catch our plane home. The man who runs it is great. Very friendly service. Its a family run place, that is 4 generations strong. Make sure to stop in and see them when you visit New Orleans!",

The burger was bland. The shrimp boudin also needs a little more seasoning, the shrimp is a little rubbery. I guess you can say we expected the creole food to have a little more seasoning in general. We saw the cook take out the shrimp boudin pit it in a microwave,  take it out, put a stick in it and wrapped it in foil and gave it to a customer. Do not order any of the pastas.

The Po\u2019boy was much better fitted to the location and had more than twice the crawfish load as the etoufee\u2019 for several dollars less. I also brought my own cup and asked for some water from the tap and was told I could get ice, but they couldn\u2019t serve me water. Ridiculous! The service wasn\u2019t great either, though it didn\u2019t help that one of the employees had called in sick. Ok to go to for a bite to eat, but not as highly recommended as I would have hoped.",

My husband and I ordered a Cajun Shrimp Pasta and a Nawlins Burger, we waited for service for literally 45 mins. When we got it, it was literally a burger that could have been made on a hotplate in 10 mins. The pasta that I was told was being made fresh to order was cold and broken as if it was a pasta that was reheated. Finally I asked for a refund, I didn't demand one like another customer did in the same hr timeframe, but we were both told that we would not be refunded because the receipt states that on HOLIDAYS and PARADE DAYS that wait could be anywhere from a 45-1hr wait, it wasn't a holiday or parade day but the dude in the back insisted that that also applies to when they have a number of excess customers, also the receipt does actually state no refunds so please please please, I advise you to be careful if choosing this place to eat at because I'm almost positive you will not be satisfied.  Oh P.S. the amount spent on the meal was $45 something. You tell me if that was worth the food. But I will state that their fruit lemonades are good. I guess that's worth the one star.",

When we refused to leave and started telling everyone that stopped by about our experience which in term cost them to lose a lot of business, he got on the phone to call the cops!

The food took forever to come out, and in the end we were charged $30 for the most underwhelming, tasteless dish I have ever had. We got the seafood platter, and the rice was undercooked and runny, the crabs had no meat inside, the few pieces of shrimp that came with it was overly salted, and the fish tasted like absolutely nothing. I am never one to give staff a hard time, but after tasting the food, we brought it up to them the issues that we had and they simply just told us that this is just how they cooked their food and there was nothing wrong with it. A horrible experience that I would not recommend to anyone.",

He needed a spice called Nawlins Cajun Spice that is only sold at your cool place. Funny thing he owns a spice company called Red River Spice Company. I highly recommend that spices well he has an assortment of them. Anyway... We thought we can find it anywhere else so we went to like three or four other places but nobody had it as we were pressed for time for studio session. Even with having the address to place it was kind of hard to find. Plus they didn't answer the phone when we were calling to find the address. But we finally found the place and the service was awesome and the spice is incredible. All well worth the trouble we went through to get this specific spice.

When I received the plate it barely had food in it (much less $$9.95 worth of food). I requested that they kindly put more food on the plate and the employee rejected to do so. They stated that it was the portion that they served for that dish. I then requested that they switch out the dish and they refused to do so. I then requested for a refund and they refused that also. The staff was belligerent and rude towards me and other patrons that were having their own set of issues. I had purchased that dish and was regretful because it was not worth the money especially because the intention of purchasing that dish was to give it to a homeless man. I felt terrible that I gave him such a small portion. I was extremely dissatisfied and the \"manager\" that came out to address my concerns (after begging to speak to a manager for half an hour) told me \"what you get is what you get\". Unbelievable! I will never return to this establishment and will not recommend it to anyone!",

I have been visiting New Orleans for years, it's almost like a second home for me. However, when ordering one of my favorite Cajun dishes (jambalaya) I was utterly disappointed. I will not go into detail, but I will say that this business definitely does not reflect the traditional quality and reputation of New Orleans food. I tried returning my meal, but both hostesses insisted that it was in fact the correct way of making the dish, which I found embarrassing on their part. Please do not waste $10 for under-cooked \"traditional\" jambalaya. New Orleans has much more to offer! :-)",
