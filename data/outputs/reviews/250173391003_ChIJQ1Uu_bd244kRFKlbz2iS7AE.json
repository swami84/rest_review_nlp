I think i saw the menu saying that it's handpulled??? It definitely doesn't seem like it's handpulled. Not a big issue.  The ramen werent bad but i wish there was more meat. My bowl of R02 spicy ramen only had 2 extremely thin slice of ramen, half a egg, and little veggies. Okay for the price though. Only $10. It didnt taste bad and i actually liked it but it could be a bit more spicier.  Service was good. The host is also the waitress. She came to check on us 3x and offered help on what to order when we weren't decided yet. Nice lady  Bill comes with fortune cookies",

They also don\u2019t use the chewy curly ramen noodles so the texture wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. Perhaps I\u2019d just stick to sushi next time!",

I'll say right off the bat that it's unfortunate I am giving this review because my experience wasn't all bad.  I ordered a chirashi (raw fish) meal combo w/ miso soup and a can of Coca Cola on the side. Within literally thirty minutes of putting the order in it arrived! I was pleasantly surprised and rushed out to meet the delivery driver. Upon opening up the order and getting down to business. A nice cold coke, a nice hot miso, and what's this? A warmer than room temp sashimi dish. WARMER THAN ROOM TEMP. Like, warm to the point where you poke the caviar and it's congealed together.  I did my best to eat it because I don't want to waste anything but I really couldn't. Rarely do I call a restaurant as well for a refund, if there's something wrong I usually just eat the cost because I know how it is running restaurants, I've been in and out of the industry for almost a decade.  They told me that the only way they would refund me is if they came back and took all the food away. The whole thing, coke soup and all. I tried to explain that I was already eating the soup and drinking the coke and that if they bring it back they're going to throw it away. He wouldn't have it and got very angry with me, they NEEDED all of it, half drank coke and all. Probably because he thinks I'm lying. Come on. A first time customer, at least trust someone sometimes maybe they'll come back.  So, alright, I told him I'd just call grub hub. They ended up calling the restaurant and tried to explain the situation and work something out but he refused to refund me and told me that unless I give them back EVERYTHING that I'm basically out of luck.  So, the grubhub employee apologized for the unreasonableness of the management and they gave me a $10 credit, which is okay. I really am more okay with that, because I didn't really want to take money away from the restaurant. If they could've compromised and refunded just the fish, or half the bill I would probably be leaving at least a 4-star review but due to the stubborn, angry, and very selfish management I will never recommend this place.  Bummer too, the soup is great :P",

Appetizer wasn't very big but was enough for us: he loved his ramen (bit spicy and he was chugging water but thought it was delicious) and I enjoyed my teriyaki beef, though it was a little bland and could have used more sauce. Place is well air conditioned and my food got cold before I finished but I'm a slow eater. Otherwise the food gets an A from me.  The sit down area itself is small but we were the only ones there for the majority of our visit. As a result the waiter was hovering quite a bit and had some difficulty understanding our order (he didn't seem to know the whole menu yet) but the place is from what I understand pretty new. It deserves some more attention.",
