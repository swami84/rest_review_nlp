And I love thai food, and been in the industry for awhile, so I've tasted loots of dishes, but the lack of effort and the amount of msg they put in the food here should NOT even be given out for free! What people think is flavorful, at this place is LOADS of MSG. On top of that the service is horrible, they bring your apps and the mains at the same time so by the time you are done with your app, your main is stone cold. And for that contributes that they don't put the heat on, on a cold winter day. Instead of appreciating customers that they support their business still in the times like this, they do less than ever, just for profit. Nope, it doesn't work like that.",
