But first time i noticed something that made me think twice for not ordering from this place anymore. I work across the street. As always tonight i went there to oder my food right 10 mins before they were about close. While i was ordering my food i noticed the guy was in the kitchen drop 3 pieces of chicken while was packing it for delivery i guess and he didn't hesitated at all putting it back again. I informed it to the guy who was in the counter. Despite being paying attention on that issue he got rude with me and raised his voice like- what you want small or big\". i was like wait, why you didn't say anything after i informed you something that is not supposed to be and instead of taking that seriously you are rushing me out to place my order. After that we had a little bit of argument and then i asked to return my money and I left without ordering. God bless that person who ordered that food. If they can do this to a regular customer after that customer witnessed everything happening, god knows what they do behind our back. I am not ordering my food ever again from this place. Good luck to all.",
