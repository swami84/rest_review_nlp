My friends and I couldn't get enough so we decided to have dinner in their brick & mortar shop that same day. We split the seafood nachos and the level up steam pot. Both meals were absolutely amazing! the price is a bit on the high side, but it's seafood so expected and oh so worth it. While waiting for your meal, they offer table top games, which were entertaining. This is going to become one of my go-to spots in Baltimore. I would recommend. They even have happy hour and will be starting a brunch menu/service on the weekends.",

I also tried the shrimp basket and omg those fries are so delicious. I wish I could order fries alone. Haven\u2019t seen this at the restaurant yet but I also love their bread pudding, hope to see it on their menu at my next visit! This place is a must try!

Chargrilled Cheese Louise Oysters  were very good.  4.5 out of 5 stars because there was no hot sauce on tables or offered but was available for the asking.  Also, the pepper shakers have a single small hole that required a workout to get pepper to come out, not worth the effort.",
