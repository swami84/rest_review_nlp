You won't be disappointed because the flavor of the chicken isn't something you can get at any chinese restaurant also even after bringing it home it's still crispy. The rolls are extremely good especially with the chef's special sauces on top also the homemade lemon tea that I bought was also one of a kind. It wasn't too sweet nor was it too sour.",
