My husband ordered the fish tacos which was above average. Also we ordered the deep fried calamari which is superb! Drinks are also very good especially during their legit (low price) happy hour. One of our drinks was late because they were busy, but they made up for that!",

The prices were a bit expensive for what you got, with it being $10 for one margarita (that wasn\u2019t even all the way up the glass, about 2/3 full). I ordered the fish tacos with french fries and coleslaw. The fries were very good, the coleslaw not so much. It was made with the same tartar sauce served with the fish tacos, and quite watery, tasting like vinegar and pickles mostly. The fish tacos were quite tasteless, prompting me to only eat because I was hungry. Lesson learned to never go here again.",

It's surprisingly hard to find quality, affordable cooked fish in Waikiki. Paia is it and they nail it every time. The Ono is cooked to perfection and whether you decide to get the burger or the plated fish, both are sure to please. We usually got burgers because the coleslaw is also really good. I also tried the seafood pasta and the sauce was delicious and they did not skimp on the fish.  Additionally, the staff is really nice and accommodating. My five year old just wanted fish with no sides so we ordered him an Ono burger with no bun or toppings and they were happy to oblige every time. While we're happy to be in our house, we miss being walking distance to Paia and can't wait to visit again!",

This is not a matter of privacy issues because nobody cares to use this information other than contact tracers to inform you if you have been potentially exposed to a covid outbreak. Not faithfully implementing this is the reason why this country has one of the highest covid rates in the world.

Figured ehhh, you can get food on their menu back home in California...there's nothing special or Hawaiian about this place. We try to get authentic Hawaiian good when we're there you know? Anyways, my husband goes \"no, we have to stop by here.\" We we're headed to another restaurant but on our way we saw this spot and it was almost like fate cause our original spot was still a 15 minute walk away. And so my husband got what he wanted!  There was a good amount of people there for a weekday evening. Many of them tourists. They have a little patio area in the front and tons of seating inside. We go in and order the fish tacos and they gave us a number and we decided to sit outside on the patio. So yes, seat yourself seating like many places on the island. We waited quite a bit...about 25 minutes for the fish tacos (2) with half and half, potatoes and rice. When the food finally showed up, it looked like a lot of lettuce up top and barely any fish meat. But once we took our first bites...we realized there's an abundant amount of white fish and it tasted so fresh! I was surprised it was that yummy! Perfect for two people! And the rice was also great! Try the tiger sauce, they have it on the tables!",
