I\u2019m so disappointed in the drop of everything here. Saddened that they don\u2019t care about the quality of their food anymore or how it tastes. The last time I went I had the chicken fajita wow it was gross. No seasoning, super bland all around and they didn\u2019t have porterhouse or ribeye steak!!! And the last few times I\u2019ve had the steak it was tough even while cooked medium and it tasted bland. I don\u2019t like the Long Island location anymore and unfortunately I won\u2019t be going again nor will I recommend anyone going here to the Elmont location yuck... it\u2019s a real shame they used to be really good. The pictures I\u2019ve posted were from 6 months ago when they were still kind of decent.",

Ribs were horrible, the steak was disgusting, medium came out to be well done, it was tasteless and dry! Burger was plain and honestly waste of $300 at this restaurant.

They don't have a proper setup to keep things warm while the rest of the food is cooked so when we got all our items some had cooled down and others were just warm. If they can have plate warmers or something similar that would make the experience better.",

They washed their hands in front of me and changed gloves. I ordered beef ribs, rice, mac and cheese, and corn bread. The rice was good . The mac and cheese was completely flawless it had to have been 5 kinds of cheese. To be honest it could be considered a meal all to itself. The ribs. I'm a little torn about. The meat is tender and delicious,  but I guess I just  expected the serving to have more. But then again I do eat a lot. It was 1 long bone with about 5 cut pieces of meat falling off it. The chef gave me extra sauce to mix in the rice. Which is what I usually do. The cornbread came with fried onions to put on the ribs. He kept all the dry stuff together. The cornbread was slightly sweet and it doesn\u2019t crumble. This was just a few things on the menu. To me it\u2019s enough to keep me coming back. The chef also gave me tea to help with my immune system. Hospitality like that is what turns customers into clients.",

The steak was well done and it tasted amazing with the sides. The Mac and Cheese was exquisite and great quantity; honestly a person can just order that if they aren't to hungry. The Chili Cheese burger was also great with the spice being just right. The sweet potato fries were a bit dry but the sauce fixed that up and the meal was delicious. the bill was a bit $$ but it was worth it. I would definitely go again and recommend the steaks to others.",

One of my very new experience for love of there menu, and customer service got even stronger. At the resturant, Arsh greeted me and my coworking very warmly and took us to the table with menu (Also gave us Tortillaswith sauce). Then gave us some time took order which we were trying for first time and had been recommended by him. We got BBQ Burger, Atomic Wings, waffle fries, Chicken Quesadilla, Chicken Mishkati, Juicy Lucy and few more. Also during our time there he stopped by few time to check if we were doing ok. He also asked us for feed back and if we would recommend other.  Ofcourse we would. 5/5 on wait time, 5/5 Food, 5/5 Customer service and 5/5 Dessert. If i was one reading this review then i would give a try and let my taste buds enjoy excellence. ARSH, and team at Addy's BBQ thank you. See you soon.",

At times the waitress seemed overwhelmed as a big family was having lunch at this establishment however, she kept her cool and made many attempts at making sure our table had everything we needed. Buffalo wings were amazing, country style fried chicken hit the spot and the short ribs fell right off the bone. But the highlight were the burgers! Great flavor, perfectly cooked and the chief/owner even came out and shook my hand! You gotta appreciate service like this!

We came in on a Friday night ready for our burgers. We looked over the menu, decided on our orders and sat there waiting an absurd amount of time to get our orders taken. To add on, one of the waiters headed over to a family that just walked in to take their orders. Not the way to run a successful business. We had to really get their attention by waving them over. I want them to succeed because they offer delicious halal food. However they need customer service training.",

Staff was so sweet.i can't wait to go back  Update: what happened?!???? Went to eat again and omg so disappointed. I wish we stopped somewhere else. My husband got jerk chicken sandwich which was filled with peppercorn. Jerk chicken is supposed to be spicy but not just peppercorn spicy. It also came in a bun. A sandwich in a bun \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I was craving chicken over. And I received rice with side of chicken ka salan  basically. It was super oily and not what I wanted or expected. One of the guys came over to ask how the food was and told him chicken over rice wasn't good and how it had gravy. He went to tell the cook, came back and said it was done in tandoor. There is no way that was done in tandoor. It was too oily and had too much gravy to be cooked in tandoor.  I wish I sent back the food. It was waste of money. I took 2 bites and brought it home and will be throwing it out soon. I don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon",

However, they\u2019re not very consistent with their food/service. Sometimes we\u2019ll be served chips and salsa while we wait for our food, other times not. I\u2019ve ordered the Amarillo burger 3 times (it\u2019s good okay) but each time there was something different. The first time I was given an onion ring with my burger and saut\u00e9ed onions inside- 10/10, it was absolutely perfect. The next time, no onion ring and instead of saut\u00e9ed onions I got crunchy onions in the burger? Still not bad though. Then the last time was just...strange. There were regular raw onions, pickles, and the bun was even different. I mean I still enjoyed it because the Amarillo sauce is what makes the burger, but I was disappointed in the lack of consistency in the restaurant. Also the fries are always over cooked. I still get excited going there because I really do enjoy their food, the environment\u2019s nice, and the people are friendly. Just wish they were more consistent.",

We looked at the photos on Yelp and the fact that it was Halal and we were sold. So we headed over and as you walk in you notice how amazing the decor is. I absolutely loved the atmosphere of the place. The wait staff is cordial and the food was absolutely amazing.  For starters we got a side of Mac n cheese, masala fries and jerk wings. The Mac n cheese was the best Mac n cheese I have ever had in my life.The only thing I think they can add is to have a variation with lobster Mac n cheese. Other than that it was perfect; right temperature right cheese consistency our entire table loved it. The wings were nothing special, they were good wings but you can only expect jerk wings to get so close to perfection if they are not from an authentic jerk spot. Lastly the Masala fries were told to be spicy but they had more of a subtle spice to it, almost similar to Cajun fries, which we loved nonetheless.  For the main courses we got filet mignon, rib eye, beef ribs and a Cajun chicken sandwich. Both the filet mignon and the rib eye came with a side of potatoes with gravy and grilled vegetables and both steaks were cooked as ordered which is sometimes tough in certain restaurants. My other friends who ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and the beef ribs enjoyed their entrees very much and you can imagine especially since they look so good !  The only thing I would want them to improve on is their wait staff. It\u2019s something very small but small detail can make or break a business. We had asked our waiter to allow us time to finish our starters before bringing out that main courses which is exactly what he didn\u2019t do. So as we were eating we were trying to scramble and make room on the table for the food and rush and eat the starters so the main course doesn\u2019t get cold... which is exactly what I was afraid of. Eventually we didn\u2019t have room so we used the table next to us to place some of the courses and dishes.  Lastly we asked for some of our food to be packaged to go, instead of taking our food to the kitchen to package the wait staff gave us the bins to package ourself. I normally wouldn\u2019t bother commenting on this but since the food was so good I expected that extra level of service as well.  There menu has so many delicious items that you can\u2019t possibly try them in one visit, I will definitely be back with company sooner than later.  Food: 5/5 Service: 3/5  Addys BBQ: 8/10 $100.70 bill total.",

The reason I\u2019m giving them a 2 star is because we were a crew of 7 that came in with a reservation at 8:45. It was a little busy which is understandable, so we didn\u2019t get a seat till 9. It took a waiter 15 minutes to finally get to our table so that we can order. Other parties after us had come in and sat down near us. That\u2019s where it began. After about a 15-20 minute wait we started seeing parties that came after us were getting there food quicker than us. Someone even ordered the same cheesy fries I did. We asked a gentleman what was going on and he said he would check for us and never returned. We finally got our food at 10:17 PM with just appetizers. Took another 15 minutes to get everything else. After the meal the same gentlemen who kept telling us he will check on things had the audacity to ask if we liked service to which everyone stayed quiet. We finally get the bill thinking we\u2019re not tipping these people only to find a 15% gratuity automatically added. One our guys was ready to push to get that waived but we decided not to raise an issue. Point being..service tonight was horrible.",

I have been here when they had a soft opening, and been a repeat customer, only to see the quality decline within 12 months. Last night was the final nail in the coffin. Order food, get food, masala fries are cold. Ask waiter to please heat them up, 15 minutes later returns and says they wont charge us for the fries and puts them back on our table (rudely), even colder. One of our friend's steak was extremely bland, ask the waiter how we can make this better, he proposes to bring a sauce to make it taste better, returns 15 minutes later, now the steak is cold. Waiter makes a sarcastic remark and walks away without doing anything about this. We ask the other waiter to take the steak back. Drinks we ordered from the start never showed up, dessert we ordered at the end never showed up. Had to constantly remind them about everything. Its fine, I understand people have bad days. What I also am is a businessman, I know when I am charging my clients money I have a responsibility to deliver every penny's worth and go beyond. Unfortunately 99% of halal restaurants in New York refuse to hire an experienced restaurant consultant to guide them in running a successful business and cater to their guests' palette.",
