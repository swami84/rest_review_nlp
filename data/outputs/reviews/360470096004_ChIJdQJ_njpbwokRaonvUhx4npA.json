I can\u2019t stop thinking about the crab empanada, my mezcal guava cocktail, & octopus taco. We also had a fried seafood platter with the homemade salsas and wished we could buy the bottles of their salsas. For dessert we had coconut flan and chocolate empanadas with homemade ice cream. From the tortillas to the fish to the icecream everything was so fresh and the highest quality. To top it all off the ambience was incredible- beautiful spacious back patio, great music, super accommodating kind staff. Can\u2019t wait to go back. \u2014 \ufffceating dinner at El Rey Del Pescado.",

The court yard has been modified for year round dining and is comfortable anytime of the year.  Overall a great experience would and will come again!
