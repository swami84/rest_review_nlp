The individual who had taken my order was very kind and very easy to understand and she helped to describe the food very well.  I ordered the vegetarian friendly food and it's amazing. I personally ordered two because I was not sure how large they would be. But, I think either 1 or 2 would suffice. Below are photos of the vegetarian friendly meal.  I also ordered the \" Chica Morada 'Purple Corn Drink' \". Very good. Reminds me of an horchata",
