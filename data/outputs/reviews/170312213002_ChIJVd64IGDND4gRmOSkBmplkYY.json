It\u2019s certainly not a pizza-quesadilla or else they would have spelled it papa-\u201ddilla\u201d. Maybe Papa John\u2019s is still trying hard not to be offensive since their split with their jackass founder? They claim it\u2019s inspired by the \u201cpiadina\u201d which is an Italian sandwich - so why not name it the papa-\u201ddina\u201d? Whether it be foolhardy oversight or calculated decision, I still had to try this enigmatic culinary creation.  I decided eventually to try the buffalo chicken experience. Upon opening the box, I was not deterred by the look of this mystifying hand-held concoction.  It honestly looked more like a lazy man\u2019s cal-zone. It certainly didn\u2019t live up to the commercial hype -- but  really what food on TV does? The cheese was melted, the buffalo sauce was oozing, and it was warm, so I was satisfied with my purchase based on early returns.  I bit into what I expected to be an exquisite elevation of chain-pizza grub, and much to my dismay, any satisfaction I found fleeting at best. Was it good? Sure. Was it great? Not even close. It was perfectly and absolutely mediocre. I\u2019d describe it as the Ford Focus of food -- it does the job but it\u2019s really not something I\u2019m proud to have around my friends. It tasted good but was it really \u201cbetter than a sandwich?\u201d I\u2019d say it depends on the sandwich it\u2019s going up against.  Would I try it again? I mean sure, if I accidentally stumble into a PJ\u2019s during a late night gallivant and it\u2019s the fastest and most affordable thing to quell my drunken stupor, I\u2019d eat it again. But with the plethora of options at our disposal for both pick-up and delivery in 2020, I\u2019m a hard pass otherwise. Overall, I\u2019d rate my Papadia a C+. (5 stars for the staff)",

If you recall it was an amazing day out, so some friends and I we\u2019re having a few drinks outside reminiscing over pre-COVID days and you name it. Eventually we became hungry and It dawned on us for some pizza. Unfortunately being in a tough location (delivery wise) other papa John locations turned us down service.  After speaking on the phone with a gentleman by the name of Ivan, being VERY considerate of our situation, he cut us some slack. He didn\u2019t want us drinking and driving so he made an exception for us. Which was great! The pizza came out hot and fresh (even being out of your delivery zone) and Melany delivered the delicious pizzas (along with Jalape\u00f1o rolls).

An hour and 15 min deep we called because it said online that our order had been completed, which it had not been.  After calling this location a few times, we realized they were hanging up on our calls or silently answering the phone and just putting it down or on mute so the phone would stop ringing.  Unfortunately for them, I am relentless and just continued to call until someone picked up. When someone did finally pick up, it sounded like the Titanic was sinking in the background, and the person on the phone frantically yelled, \"CAN YOU PLEASE HOLD, PLEASE HOLD, THE OVEN IS ACTING UP\" but finally answered our call a few minutes later.  Maybe hire someone capable of answering a phone? I recommend nearly anyone over the age of seven.  Pizza arrived cold but satisfactory.",

Called the store and they said the driver was instructed to check in that it was delivered even though he was still on the road to deliver it...the pizza arrived at 10:27pm...how does this happen? 55-65 minutes was what I was told in 2 different forms...disappointed with this store and experience. Will order elsewhere next time.",
