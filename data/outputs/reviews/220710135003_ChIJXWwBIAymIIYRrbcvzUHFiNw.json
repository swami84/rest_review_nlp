We are looking to return to New Orleans just so we can dine here again. The chef here is fabulous. We ordered the three entrees. The chef came out of the kitchen and ask us our likes and dislikes, then he returned to the kitchen and create a unique dish for each entree. Each and every evening the menu changes. Food is created using local Farm to Table products that are gathered each and every day from the local markets. Recommend this place to everyone we meet and speak with, that will be in tye New Orleans area and are looking for this type of one of a kind dining experience.",

We decided to try it, to be honest based on price.  We chose the three course Feed Me and did not regret it. You have to be willing to eat whatever Chef Mars is in the mood to make.  It was worth the risk. The first course was crawfish beignets.  They were fried to perfection, crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  These were served in a delicious sauce (sorry the name of it escapes me) that was so tasty I wiped the remainders up with french bread. ( I did that with every course).  The second course was a quarter quail over a eid of bacon-infused mixed sauteed greens with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce.  Delicious!  The entree course was rib eye steak over a mixture of roasted brussel sprouts and some salad greens with another sauce that escapes my memory.  Service was adequate but nothing to write home about.  The total bill with a glass of wine each, tax and tip was $150.  This is far less than I would have spent for something similar at Antoine's, Galatoire's or Arnauds.  We will definitely try this again.",

But what will be on the table is entirely up to the chef, and each table can be different. We ordered the 3 course \"Feed Me\" menu.  First course - clayfish beignets Second course - tiger shrimps over fish/grit Entree - braised buffalo shortribs over garlic mash potato, top with fried oysters  Both starters are very good. Fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly. But the buffalo shortrib is to die for. It is very tender (meat falling off the bone), juicy and seasoned perfectly. Chef said it was braised for 12 hours. The oysters are big, sweet, and fresh not overcooked.  I will certainly go there again when I'm in town.",

I had the blackened amberjack with red beans and rice special.  Perfect.  I had the fried green tomatoes appie.  A completely different FGT experience.    Others at my table loved the boudin appie, and the salads are great.  Very happy.  Wish I had done the feed me experience, maybe next year for Jazz Fest.",

        "caption": "When a restaurant is kept intentionally small so that the Chef is the only one touch every aspect of your meal it's a good sign. Such is the case with Chef Eric Mars of Louisiana Bistro.  I've been dining there since well before Hurricane Katrina and the experience has always been stellar. The multi course \"Feed Me\" is particularly deserving of note. Chef Mars comes to the table side and converses with you in detail about what you do and do not like. He then goes into the kitchen and creates a suitable masterpiece.  A gustatory jewel of great price, Louisiana Bistro is one of the best meals in a city that is known globally for its cuisine.",
