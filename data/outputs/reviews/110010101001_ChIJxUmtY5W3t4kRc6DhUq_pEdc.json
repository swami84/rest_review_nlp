Highly recommend the Mac n cheese (made with smoked gouda, YUM) and the all american burger. They have happy hour all day, lots of local beers, and great service. The ambience is 10/10 and they have immaculate and visually pleasing bathrooms! I had an absolutely fantastic time! There is street side parking, but it's scarce so I'd be ready to walk. Five minutes away from the metro, too!",

Unlike before, customers can't walk up to the omelette/waffle bar-you have to order your omelette and waffle on an order sheet and give it to your server; smart!  The omelette was great! I was surprised that the waffle automatically came with chicken. They DID say chicken and waffles. Maybe I didn't read it right. Hey, I'm not about to complain about fried chicken.  Maybe I am because unfortunately the chicken was not well seasoned at all. I just moved it to the side and the waffle was tasty though. It makes the most sense to do the all-you-can-eat/bottomless option. We only ate one portion of each and were full, but it's worth it Bc it would've been more \u00c0 la carte.",

They all make an effort to get to know you while you\u2019re in line and are extremely knowledgeable of their food. The managers take the time to work on the little details, whether cleaning off the glass doors, or the tables in the restaurant and this work ethic shows time after time. I love the salads that they offer and the people make the experience so personal. I have made a connection here and I feel extremely valued as a customer every time I step foot in the door.

The salmon on quinoa was just the right size, and the salmon was cooked perfectly (no one likes dry salmon!). For dessert, the chocolate fudge cake was a good choice if you love chocolate. It is definitely on the decadent end of the chocolate spectrum! When I arrived, I saw that there was a large bottle of hand sanitizer right outside of the front door and I waited a couple of minutes before the staff brought my order to me. The staff wore a mask and gloves. Hope to try other items next time!",

Everything tasted excellent and George and the rest of the employees took excellent care of us.

Went for brunch on a Sunday and it's just not worth the price. The chopped fried chicken pieces was the most flavorful item they offered. Unseasoned hot water Shrimp and Zits (the grits I can only imagine to be animal feed) bottomless mimosas/Bellinis/Bloody Marys made primarily with cheap alcohol and not a drop of the fruit/veggie juices that makes them refreshing was sad. The omelet station had the ingredients that should have made a decent omelet, but only to get back to to the table to find it not palatable. The chopped chicken pieces and the waffle were the best items on the brunch buffet, definitely not worth the $52 they charge. Oh and they offer you two side items from their full menu to go with the brunch buffet. I chose applewood smoked bacon and a salad. The bacon was cooked to the point that it became charcoal and the bland salad was just spring mix with white balsamic dressing (oil and vinegar). All of the other side items mimicked the items offered on the buffet so choose wisely. I did hear that the chicken sausage was ok. Those in my party that ordered directly from the menu were also underwhelmed by what was presented to them as food. Also, don\u2019t leave any personal items on the table to only go back to discover that they are long gone where the table busser, waiter, or patrons at adjacent tables take them as the spoils of war. As, I think back on it I should have had them play the tape as an overhead camera was in the area. In the end, it all makes sense because after the overall experience I could only come to the realization that you've been had from the moment that you walked through the door.",

Probably the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Our waiter, Wes, was a lot of fun.  Cons: The host was less than pleasent. Practically through our menus on the table. Just overall seemed bothered to be there. For $42, the fillet mignon could have come with more than just an bowl of arugula that was drowning in dressing. A nice pepper sauce or port sauce would have made it a better value. It was a good steak, just very bare and out of contrast with everything else on the menu.  Overall, I would come back for the drinks and Max and cheese and tryout the other dishes.",

They didn't have any rice, which I am used to having with my salmon.  They didn't have any brocolli, which again I love to pair with my salmon.  I got bitten like crazy by mosquitoes sitting outside...the weather was amazing and so is the ambience.  But they get 5 stars.  Let me tell you why.  The food is DELICIOUS.  Everything that came was exquisite. Their deviled eggs are YUM...I ate one of each. The mac and cheese paired very well with the salmon, although the salmon comes with potatoes and green beans.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food and great service. Definitely returning at least one more time before I head back home.  PS: to get here from the Westin, turn right and just keep walking along the building without crossing any streets. There's also a 24 hour CVS along that route. You shouldn't walk more than 5 minutes.",

I was there sitting for about 10 minutes. Three other individuals came in sat at the end of the bar (separate party from myself)and some how ended up receiving full service. Ordering drinks and food. I still hadn\u2019t been acknowledged by the bartender. Until I let him know I had only been sitting there for 10 minutes.  It was only then he said oh they said you were waiting for a table. Ahhh I see, interesting.  Needless to say I did get a drink.  After being seated the waiter just dropped the menus in front of us. Mind you this is my first time. A few other with me as well. We clearly had to figure this out fast. There were a couple other things that didn\u2019t sit well with me but no need to continue about that. Maybe this was one of these experiences that was just a coincidence. I don\u2019t know.  Do I recommend this place I can\u2019t really say.  Not to sure if I will try it again anytime soon.",

It took forever for my sons food to arrive since they were making sure there are no cross contamination and I was very grateful for that. The rest of the families dinner arrived pretty fast. We ate and were full but my sons meal still wasn\u2019t ready. So he waited some more. While we were waiting I ordered French fries and my son ate some because he was so hungry. Few minutes later his lips swelled up. Apparently at this restaurant everything is fried in one oil! Everything!!! sea food, French fries, veggies, etc. So it triggered my sons allergic reaction. We rushed to the nearest hospital. I was really surprised that one oil is used for everything! Unbelievable! Very wrong! Even if there are no food allergies I believe sea food should be separate from everything else! We were very lucky we got to the hospital on time. And came back home to NY the following day. BTW, my husband paid for the dinner and left tips as well, they deducted my sons meal though. I think it would\u2019ve been nice of them not to charge us at all!",

However, if you look at the details, the food was $ 42 even though it was $ 18. Is it because 4 ounces (110 grams) in the menu were 14 ounces in the description (only 4 ounces in the menu)? Did you rewrite it yourself? Even if you look at the photos of other people's dishes, you will be suspicious of the fact that the difference with the menu is addicted because potatoes and asparagus are not visible.

His other tables were on the opposite of the bar. He took our drink and food order and 15 mins passed before our drink was delivered. I had to go back to the hostess to get service.

The interior design of Lincoln is unique and creative. A giant chair that is long enough to seat 4-5 people against the wall and of course colorful paintings of Abraham Lincoln. For 52 dollars, you can do the all you can eat brunch and bottomless mimosas. The brunch, in my opinion, was decent. Even so, check out the Lincoln and cross it off your bucket list. A very nice place a mothers day brunch or event.  Note: It is hard to find parking so i would recommend parking a block or two away and then walking or try taking a Lyft or Uber.",

No biscuits or pancakes... you had to order any other items separately for an additional cost. You DO get to choose two sides from things like bacon, home fries or grits. However those came out pretty late. I will say the omelettes are HUGE. The mimosas and bellinis were great I wish my server had left a pitcher bc I only got about three lil champagne flutes full. I could see if my boy toy and I were looking lit but sheesh! Drop off a pitcher. Erase the two sides and provide all sides for the buffet and the 52 bucks a person is well spent. That's just me though I like having all the options.  Atmosphere is lively and awesome.",

We started with a few appetizers (brussel sprouts and the deviled eggs). I thought the presentation for the deviled eggs was unique and an interesting spin on the appetizer. It didn't hurt that the deviled eggs were delicious on top of that. We just opted for the traditional deviled eggs but I would be interested in trying out the BBQ pork and sundried tomato variety!  For entrees we ordered the pot pie and the scallops. The scallops were by no means gigantic but came with beets and other vegetable chips which were a welcome addition to the meal. The scallops could have used a bit more seasoning.  The pot pie was sufficiently \"OK\" and I'm not sure if I'd order it again.  The service was fairly attentive. I'd be willing to come back and try brunch another time!",

Had seven mimosas and didn\u2019t feel anything but a stomach ache from drinking pure orange juice, same with the mules. Food was below average and our waiter had to be asked several times to refill our non-alcoholic-alcoholic beverages.  If I am paying for bottomless drinks I expect to feel drunk afterwards! No one in the group felt slightly drunk and this was evident by the bright orange color of the mimosas (which are supposed to be mainly champagne and partly orange juice). Very disappointed to spend $60 (per person) after they included a 20% gratuity for terrible service. Not going back here again and do not recommend the Fourth of July special.",
