I used to like coming here for pho with my Vietnamese girlfriend, but last time we ordered broken rice plates and when my girlfriend asked the vietnamese lady working for more nuoc mam (fish sauce for eating with food) she  just ignored her and walked into the kitchen and did not bring it to our table.  My girlfriend and I are disabled and walk with difficulty using a cane to help us get around.  My girlfriend then had to stand up and take the little dish herself to their kitchen to get more sauce.  I was very upset and told them that they will not receive a tip because of there poor service and then they copped an attitude and said sorry like they didn't mean it but just wanted to shut me (the noisy, quality demanding American man) up and get us out of there.  When I went to pay the lady tried to charge me $26.50 for the two plates we had. I dropped $25 dollars and will not return again.",
