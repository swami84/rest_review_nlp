Disappointed to see one of the employees behind the counter making the food with her mask down around her neck the entire time we were there eating our lunch.  The rest of the employees we saw were properly wearing their masks.  The food and service was excellent as always, just disappointed about lack of mask on an employee preparing the food being served.  ***EDIT***  I originally gave this location a 1 star  review and have changed it to a 5 star review now.  After receiving a survey via email requesting a review of my visit the day before, I completed the survey and requested someone contact me.  I was shocked when within appx. 15-20 minutes, the store manager called me and apologized for our experience.  She knew exactly what employee I was talking about and said that she had spoken with her about this and that wearing a mask, although uncomfortable, was required and was not negotiable.  Kudos to Panera and this manager for taking customer safety seriously and their quick response to address same.  Thank you, Panera!",

After 15 minutes I asked if my order was ready. I was told they were working on it. 10 minutes later still no bagels. I asked again. Apparently they had forgotten about my order. When I finally got my bagels I still didn't have my iced mocha. It took another 10 minutes for that. I was running late so I didn't check the bag to make sure I got the right bagels. When I was able to check I was already on the road. I got 3 cinnamon crunch bagels, a cranberry raisin, and 2 plain bagels. The employees were lackadaisical and a little rude when I asked about my order.",

I had to take it up with customer service. Second time, same delivery guy, gave explicit instructions for which door to wait outside and to call when they arrived so I could come to the door, got a call from an out of state number that left no message (I get out of state spam calls all day so I didn't answer but immediately after the call I got the text alert my delivery was here), went outside to the specified door and no one was waiting for me. Waited for about 3-5 minutes before I gave up and called the store, didn't answer again, called customer service immediately. Can't even refund my $20 until 20-30 business days. Total scam and disgusting experience. I love Panera but this delivery guy should be fired and I will never be ordering from this store again if you held a freaking gun to my head.  ** I would like to add that both experiences were deliveries made to //my job// where I was just trying to eat lunch, and SO much of my time was wasted waiting for late or abandoned deliveries, calling the store for no one to pick up, and calling customer service just to get my money back.  ****** I WOULD JUST LIKE TO RE-EMPHASIZE THAT THIS STORE STOLE $20 FROM ME FOR FOOD I DID NOT RECEIVE AND THE PANERA COMPANY WILL NOT REFUND //MY// MONEY FOR 20-30 BUSINESS DAYS.",

My coworkers and I were trying hard to find a table, really just aimlessly walking around and stalking tables until someone got up. We were just about to leave and go somewhere else until we found a table for two (there were five of us) and sat down. Damon noticed and among the craziness, offered to find some extra chairs. He was so nice and smiling and happy. It really made us feel special.  After we were finally all seated, we started ordering via the app from the table. Damon came BACK over and said that he had a large round table up near the front that would fit us all comfortably. Totally unexpected and not something he even had to do. We took him up on his offer :)  Throughout our meal Damon came back a few times to make sure we got our order and help clean up when were done. Just as we were finishing up, he walks over with 5 cookies in his hand and gives them to us, for free!!! He really went the extra mile to show us some personalized customer service amidst the crazy. Thank you, Damon!  P.S. Get this man a raise.",

Nope, the kiosks were down. Okay, so I did the \"Order to Table\" option on the app. Waited 25-30 minutes, still no food. Our friends that arrived 10 minutes after us and waited in line had already received their food. I went up to the counter to ask what was taking so long, and they asked what I ordered, as my name wasn't on the screen. Magically, the guy said my name was now the \"next\" order. Okay, great. Wait 5 more minutes and they bring the food to our table. I ordered a baguette as a side. Nope, they gave me an apple. They gave me this TINY salad - this is a half salad bowl and it's not even HALF full! Seriously? Not even remotely worth the $5 a half salad costs. It was gone in about 4 bites. I also asked for no cucumber, pickled onions, extra arugula - tons of cucumbers, no pickled onions, barely any arugula (or anything else, for that matter). Nothing was completed the way I ordered.  We had now been there for almost 45 minutes and had a meeting to get back for, so I had no time to ask for them to remake it. After how long our food took in the first place, I couldn't risk it.  The only reason I gave this location 2 stars instead of 1 is because the French onion soup was great. That, at least, lived up to my expectations.",

Your carryout orders will never, ever be correct. They have a 0% success rating even after the multiple times I have given them another chance. Attention to detail does not exist at this location.  As well, the portion size for carryout is at least half, if not 1/3 the size of dine-in portions. When I pay $10 for a meal and walk away with what should only be $5 worth of food, it's disappointing and aggravating to say the least.  I hate leaving negative reviews, but after being in communication with their office about a considerable customer service deficit and order accuracy issues, the problem persists. I only continue to give this business my money because I live in the building, am often in a hurry, and there's a sweet spot in my heart for the tasty combos I've loved from panera for years.

Looking around at the still busy Panera, we reluctantly agreed to take it to go. As we waited 15 minutes for our food to be prepared, all of the drink options were torn down. The bag of food was tossed on the counter. I asked if all 4 orders were in the bag, the guy said yes.  I checked and 3 items were missing.  First of all, why does a downtown restaurant close at 300pm on a Sunday!!?? And how does such a culture exist that it is ok to kick oaying customers out right at closing...keep the drinks operational until paying customers are done with their experience!",

I'm also not a person who goes out often to chain restaurants or fast food places but I didn't feel like cooking and wanted to try Panera. I've eaten at Panera locations before although none have been in Indianapolis. All of my experiences at these places have been decent: decent service, decent food. This evening I did the Pick 2 for $6.99 and ordered the Big Kids Grilled Cheese and Clam Chowder with chips for my side. Service was great, the cashier who took my order was nice and even gave me a free drink! The preparation of my food was quick, (this could have been due to the fact that there weren't many customers). Since I ordered my food to go, I glanced in my bag to make sure everything was accounted for and headed home. I can't began to express how disappointed I was when I laid eyes on my grilled cheese sandwich!  I expected it to be small since it was half a sandwich but there was only one type of cheese on it: American, and bread. What happened to the various assortment of cheeses included on the menu? Where was the bacon? Needless to say it was a let the down, the soup was the highlight of the meal but that and the bag of chips aren't worth the $7+ that was paid for an entire meal, Not even the free soft drink can make up for it. Some would say that I've could've returned to the location and spoken to someone but the walk home was a distance and the return trip to complain about the sandwich would've honestly been futile.  Maybe there was a lack of communication between the staff in regards to the order but I honestly don't think I'll be back to dine at this location anytime soon.",
