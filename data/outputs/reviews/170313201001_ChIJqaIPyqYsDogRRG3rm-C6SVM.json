My companion noted how many of the Restaurant Week items had beans in them, so we ordered off the usual menu. I had the Crispy Brussel Sprouts ($13) which had to have been shaved on a machine, they were so thinly sliced. I loved the char and the cheese, and it was a huge portion, although it was a bit salty for me. To counter that, I had the Debbie Harry, ($10+) a crazy Warhol-inspired dessert that was a chocolate malt (not sweet enough!) topped with banana-flavored cotton candy, with a side of fries. I'd already reached my sodium limit, so I gave the fries to my friend, along with the chipotle mayo that came to dip my sprouts in.",

Despite all the great things, the prices were surprisingly not that high either. I highly recommend this place for brunch.

We ordered our food based on the waiter's recommendations; Shakshuka and Crab Fries. The Shakshuka was too sour and didn't taste well. The Crab Fries had barely no \"crab\" in it and almost 80% was of just McDonald's fries. They were both totally not worth the money.  The waiter was unkind. He kept passing by our table even after he surely saw us trying to order and get our check and pay for it. He wouldn't talk back to what we said to him, and just came by to pour water.  Also, I reserved our brunch as my birthday, and received nothing. I remember reading a review that someone had received a plate of cake, but for us no one mentioned a word about it.  I would say the prices were for the view and the \"modern and calm\" ambiance, not the food or service.",

And the restaurant was definitely not busy for Thursday lunch.  The food was just ok: my duck was served VERY rare, and was cold.  My wife's pasta dish had gone cold, too-- leaving the sauce less-than-appetizing.  We came to the conclusion that the server had forgotten our food in the kitchen.  And we weren't sure how long the wait would be for new, appropriately prepared food to come out, so we didn't say anything.  The empty charcuterie board that we had as an appetizer was never cleared from the table until our bill was brought.  After the house manager got a complaint from the table next to us, we saw him talk to the server in our area, but nothing really changed.  I ordered another glass of wine halfway through my lunch that showed up 5 minutes after I had finished eating.  It was a disappointing experience, but still better than waiting in the cattle line for the cafeteria downstairs, at least that is what we tried to convince ourselves.  Next time, we'll go to the Corner Bakery across the street instead.",

I got there 15 minutes early and had to wait a minute, but saw many people come up and ask and be told it would be at least a 40 minute wait.  As far as the portion size goes, just don't expect them to bring you a giant plate piled high with filler.  The meal is carefully made and nothing is waste.  It's enough to fill you up without making you feel like you need to loosen your belt a notch, which frankly, is nice if you are going to continue touring the gallery or the city.

There are other places at the Art Intstitue that suit children menus nicely. Gnocchi was very good.  Portions a bit small, but so tasty.  $20 for pasta in \"fine dining\" is very in-line with other comparable restaurants.  Handicapped accessible (elevators and open tables). Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Manager was interested in feedback and asked how or dining experience was.  I'll definitely return.",

The quality of food has dropped dramatically that makes me think, this is either new management or chefs or a bit of both! The cauliflower soup with apple mouse tasted like a blended potato and the mousse had the coloring of a cheap food color. They claimed it was colored with beets, but beets never leave an orangish red stain! I ordered the shrimp salad which was inspid. My son ordered the burger which was over salted and tasted heavily of the bun and nothing else. When we told the waiter he said could replace it but thankfully we didn\u2019t as the experience we had was not unique, when I read other reviews, they had complaints about the sub standard burger. I  was surprised that the waiter did not take the cost off the burger or reduce it marginally. My advice is eat along Michigan Ave and avoid having a similar experience as us.",

Our other complaint was that we asked for bread and was told they ran out due to two parties earlier and the kitchen didn't want to make more because it was late. It was at least 40 minutes before closing. When we spoke to the manager he told us that there was indeed bread, the kitchen had made it several minutes back and he offered to bring some to our table. I had, at this point, finished my meagerly portioned meal. All in all it was not a pleasant dining experience. The manager apologized, offering to buy us lunch the next time we came. However it is doubtful that we'll take him up on his offer. Not at all impressed.",

Originally came here for drinks, but discovered that the food here is awesome. Their rosemary bread is freaking delicious---- I love the saltiness mixed when it's dipped in olive oil. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had eggplant fries, which made me feel like I was being somewhat healthy while indulging. Their salad and a couple of their other dishes were pretty solid as well, so I would definitely come back to try more items off their menu.

When he placed our order he said it be right up without giving us any indication of a preparation time. We watched tables around us receive their orders, including the 20 minute hamburgers and still did not receive our food. After 45 minutes we called the waiter over and he had no idea where our food was and said he would have to get a manager.
