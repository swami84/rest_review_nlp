Its a bit small inside with a Nautical theme, dim lights, and a intimate setting but this is great for dates or just a couple of drinks afterwork during their happy hours. As soon as you walk in you'll notice the bar on the left surrounded by Tables and seats. The place wasn't that packed at the time I went, so things where comfortable. Its clean, organize, and nicely decorated. Our waitress was so nice and had plenty of patience with us as we had a bit of a difficult time understand some parts of the Me\u00f1u. Dishes have Italian titles on the Me\u00f1u, I found that some dishes are difficult to pronounce but theres also a brief description under each dish title. Other than that which is really no big deal, the food wait time was fair and the food and drinks itself where delicious. I couldn't ask for better service. Be advised this Restaurant does not have customer parking, they do accept credit cards and debit cards for payments, and the prices for food and drinks are fair. Great experience here, I would definitely comeback. \ud83d\udc4d Thank you and Enjoy.",

Is a nice place to go and get out of the routine.  They have out  seating in the summer. Is not a big place but the food is great. I would really recommend it. I have been there multiple times. They have varieties of desserts and drinks too. If you just want to go to drink or eat this is the place for you.",

The trick is not so much to be on top when you start out, but to maintain if not exceed that high level after being in business for a couple of years; staying the course takes a long term commitment and complete dedication.  The quality of food and its preparation at Porto Salvo is outstanding, and the value for your dining out dollar here is just excellent.  Compare Porto Salvo to any Italian restaurant in New York City that purports to offer fresh seafood and southern Italian dishes, and you'll find that PS exceeds them all when it comes to quality, price and ambience.  They do not scrimp on quality here and there is no such thing as slapdash preparation or presentation.  An added bonus is that both the bar and wait staff are lovely and professional; both have improved markedly since the opening, and play a critical role in the success of this establishment.",

I was there with a group and we play tennis every weekend, they were very accommodating and actually split our checks for each and every person! We were also visited by both owners one of which is also the chef this is very old school in really happens! So if you're looking for a progressive Italian food in a all inclusive atmosphere! This is a must to go to! I wish I lived closer to this place I would pop in for a drink and order food or appetizers at their bar......happy pride",

The experience was genuinely very good and relaxing, especially getting off the busy street. This cuisine is all about seafood, and trepidation about eating raw shellfish in a new venue quickly disappeared when we were served cold blue point oysters and tuna tartare, both very good. My partner ordered cavatelli with sausage and I had the fisherman's stew with cod, shrimp, mussels, calamari and tiny clams in a tomato broth. The wine list was good, approachable, and affordable. Porto Salvo is a seriously good find in the dearth of restaurants near Yankee Stadium and I recommend it without reservation. /Peter F.",

First night in New York we decided to get some food as we had just got off a three hour flight. We lifted to Porto Salvo as the reviews and food sounded amazing, and believe me we were not wrong. The food was delicious abd drinks were a treat, the only downside was the wait. I'm not sure but maybe they were understaffed but it took close to an hour from ordering our drinks to bring out the food and the butternut squash ravioli came out lukewarm at best. We asked for it to be heated back up which took another 20 minutes.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend or go back again as the food was the star of the place - as it should be.",

Definitely one of the good ones in the Boogie Down. The ambience is the first thing you notice (classy af), definitely a place you can bring a date to but also go grab a few drinks with friends at.  The pricing is perfect, 3 friends, multiple drinks, 2 apps and 3 entrees for 106.00- you can\u2019t beat that. Arturo, our server was friendly, informative and knew his menu. Great suggestions and always attentive. Will come back again and again and support this business.  Keep up the great work Porto Salvo, you are a fine establishment and hope others get a chance to experience what I did tonight.",

Nice place to go if you want to hang out with friends or family. The food is traditional italian style and it was very good. The ambiance is also very nice with dim lighting, candles and artwork which decorates the walls. The service was excellent. I highly recommend this cute and quaint local spot which compliments the area very nicely.",

My sister told me she saw this place on her way home(bus) so she google it and told me it had great reviews( I\u2019m super picky with food) so she wanted to try it out and so we went there on a Saturday afternoon and started with appetizer bruschetta with mushroom, cheese and truffle oil that was divine! The we of course order drinks and then the main course! That salmon was soooooo delicious! And my sisters pasta was great! I loved the desserts...Over all I am soo glad that she found that place because it my new favorite place! I will strongly recommend this amazing restaurant because the food  was delicious and the people that work there were just so friendly and I love the whole experience! I went back...took my sisters on a \u201cSister date night\u201d and they loved it!",

Their food is delicious I\u2019ll talk in details the excellence in the almost all foods I tasted still more to eat there.  I already have some favorites that I can call orgasmic lol also I have some deserts in that category too lol.  They start you off with fresh iced water in a glass pitcher and fresh bread warm slices with a lil olive oil and lite cream cheese mixed to dip your bread in.  Listen some might say it\u2019s pricey but if you go somewhere in the city you will pay double or triple the price and theirs might not be as authentic and genuine Italian food made from scratch organic style fresh clean delicious makes you think you are eating in Italy without going to Italy.  For more details and hopefully pics when I learn how to do it in YouTube I will share it with everyone here.  So far I been served by Arturo a very nice respectful young Spanish speaking bilingual man he is excellent in helping you decide on what you feel to eat and gives you a great description as well of whatever you may be curious about in the menu.  Also I been served by Andrea a beautiful sweet loving caring nice Italian young female who knows her hometown food freshness and can help you the same as Arturo these people are awesome beautiful and great.  I want to thank Mr. Luigi for his awesome great authentic fresh Italian foods and deserts that he has put lots of time energy and strength to making it possible to serve the Neighborhood community in the Bronx at a good price for great food.  I love u all it\u2019s like family time in there for me.  God bless u all.",

I usually don't like bean, but however they prepared Cannellini beans was to be commended because I left nothing on my plate. They had 6 desert choices and I had chosen Basil Cr\u00e8me Brulee since I had never heard of Basil and Cr\u00e8me Brulee together.

Finally a classy joint, only a few block away from home, where excellent food is served under an elegant ambiance. With a good selection of local draft beer and variety of reds and white wine to complement fabulous Italian/Spanish tapas. Porto salvo also serve pasta entree as well to complete your appetite.  I am genuinely impressed with the decor, bossa nova music, and friendly staff. I even got to meet Mark (part owner I believe). Extremely welcoming and eager to meet locals and have a friendly chat.  I truly believe that Porto Salvo was desperately needed in the Bronx which is a great play to its name \"saved port\".  For locals there's no longer a need to enter manhattan for a classy dining experience. And it's well worth it to come into the Bronx to pay a visit, have a few drink with quality fresh food.  Weather you want to enjoy a drink after a game (Yankees or NYCFC) or work, or just simply in the neighborhood. Have a romantic evening with a date, Porto Salvo is definitely a must.",
