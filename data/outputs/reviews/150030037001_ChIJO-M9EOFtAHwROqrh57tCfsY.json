The homemade whipped cream and acai were perfect consistency. The add-on bar with cacao nibs, coconut, honey, and other goodies were the figurative cherry on top. We do not make it to town often with the COVID situation, but when we do, we will make Waffle and Berry a regular stop. Cheers!",

I skipped breakfast and lunch to go all out here and it was worth it! Prices are great for what you get. I got about four meals worth of food for $25. Chocolate chip banana waffle with fresh whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. Waffle was soft inside, fresh, and had great flavor on its own. Top quality ingredients! A\u00e7a\u00ed bowl was also amazing with any number of toppings you could want. Fruit was super fresh and delicious. Pictures are as good as they look.

It's in the back left corner of the Ohana Hale Marketplace on Ward Ave.  We got acai bowls and three different waffles (chocolate, Nutella, and peanut butter themed). The waffles were good and the fruits that were used were all beautiful and tasty. The acai bowl was beautiful and delicious as well. I've probably tried around five different acai bowls elsewhere and this was my favorite. The texture and flavor of the acai was soooo good!  If you're looking for quality waffles or acai bowls, I would highly recommend Waffle and Berry.",

The owners are so friendly, which makes this place even more enjoyable to buy from!  Their a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl is by far THE BEST we\u2019ve tasted!  The a\u00e7a\u00ed is really thick and creamy (unlike most places where the a\u00e7a\u00ed melts fast), and loaded with fresh fruit!  Not to mention the free condiments you can top it off with like honey, finely shredded coconut, chia seeds, and more!  We also had the non-alcoholic kiwi mojito and it was DEEELICIOUS and so refreshing!  Can\u2019t wait to try their waffle dishes, as other customers said those are awesome as well!",

When we finally found the place, we were welcomed by the owner and his worker. They were very friendly and provided phenomenal customer service! The waffles were delicious too!
