They also sell a version that comes with noodles\u2014 wasn\u2019t hungry enough for that on top of everything else I ordered but I imagine they compliment the sauce well and let you enjoy even more of the flavor.

I ordered their spicy dumplings and spicy chicken over rice (forgot their exact names...\ud83d\ude05). The food was prepared quickly within around 5-7minutes after ordering. They call the last two numbers of ur order number and then u go up to the counter to pick up ur food. Everything is self-serve and there's is a little station for sauces and utensils on the left side after u get ur food. They have sriracha, soy sauce and homemade vinegar sauce, and containers for them. The food was okay, just not... spicy...despite the dish titles containing the word \"spicy\" in it... (good thing they had sriracha). Portion-wise, the rice was pretty big... while the dumplings were a little smaller than it seemed like in the pictures on the menu. Other than that, the workers were nice considering how one of them saw that I needed to use the bathroom before placing my order, but didn't have the passcode. (The passcode for the restroom is printed on the bottom of a receipt.)",

I stopped by for a late afternoon snack of soup dumplings. There was maybe 2-3 other customers and non-working workers or their friends hanging out in the seating area.  The 4-5 workers were behind the counter joking around.  I ordered the crab pork dumplings.  Got my tray and went to the front to sit by the window.  The first dumpling was piping hot, but then realized by the second dumpling it was unusually spicy.  I remember noticing spicy soup dumplings on the menu and decided that I had the wrong order. When I went to the counter, the worker immediately confirmed I had the wrong order and corrected it.  When I went back to the window seat to eat my order, I put the remaining spicy dumplings to the side and noticed a homeless guy pass by the window and then came into the restaurant. I tried to ignore him, but he unintelligibly spoke and gestured to my abandoned dumplings. I shrugged and continued to eat. He then grabbed a dumpling with his hand which immediately squirted all over the place. I jumped up and looked at the workers for help.  The homeless guy grabbed my  other dumpling which squirted all over my white bag which was on the stool next to me.  I then grabbed my purse and tray with my remaining crab pork dumpling and marched up to the counter to said loudly \u201cExcuse me! Some help would be nice!\u201d The workers seemed startled and clueless so I dumped the rest of my food and stormed out. I blame poor management for this situation and not the hungry homeless guy or clueless workers. I was able to clesn off the dumpling liquid off of my bag and coat, but still fuming over this incident.",

But is it pretty decent for the neighborhood? Well, yeah.  It's a self order counter to one side, as well as a cashier who would also take your order on another. Great efficiency to their system that works well with their lunch rush. Sauces are to the side for the customer to grab to their liking (always grab vinegar for the xiaolongbao) and additional napkins are there. Last time I went, trash cans were filled to the rim and there wasn't any more room. Some clean up could be done, but they were in the middle of a lunch rush.  The Xiaolongbao wasn't steaming out and on the point of burning my tongue, which is a small negative in my book. I can see why not everyone wants that small risk of tongue burning like me. Their spoons are strange and not as effective as traditional take out spoons, but I can see the innovative, space saving and compostable design.  Noodles were pretty good. Nice flavor, nice portion size. Nothing too bad about the food at all. I had a rice dish with an egg -- everything mixed well together and the egg, with a slightly runny yolk, always makes things better.  I've had better Shanghainese food elsewhere, but again, didn't expect much from this neighborhood that no one can really call a Chinatown. It was a bit pricey for Shanghainese (look at Joe's Shanghai for super affordable, high quality Shanghainese), but average for the neighborhood. Not bad.",

They were not hot and the skin was hard, signaling to us that they were made earlier and waiting to be sold. It was greatly disappointing. The prices are also high for the small portions that were provided. We also go a meatball entree which were two small balls with no rice for $7. It was not enough to fill anyone up. Maybe things taste better when there\u2019s no rush? I suggest avoiding this during the lunch rush.",

I\u2019m from the west coast so my reference for soup dumplings is the infamous Din Tai Fung XLB, but this dumpling was pretty good! The wrap is pretty thick around the dumpling and gets sticky pretty soon after you pop the lid off the container - but taste wise is pretty delicious! I got the spicy pork XLB and it wasn\u2019t too spicy but gives a different taste profile than a traditional pork bao - worth a try. Pics also show beef noodle soup, sweet and spicy pork dumplings, and sweet and sour pork rib dry noodles. Definitely recommend you stop by if you\u2019re in the area and in the mood for dumplings!",

The atmosphere is clean and modern.  There is a self-order counter which is nice because there are a lot of options on their menu and I didn't feel rushed to order!  There are also options to customize your dishes with like adding extra meat or extra rice or even choices between mixed veggies or chinese cabbage with rice/noodles.  I would recommend getting their: -SOUP DUMPLING (aka xiaolongbao XLB) which are done very well.  Soup has good flavor and the dumpling wrapper has just the right chewiness and thickness. -PAN FRIED BUNS : we got the vegetable one (green in color) - flavor was on point as well and I loved the crispiness of the bottom of the bun but the soft breadiness of the bun. -FRIED CHICKEN FILLET over rice w/ egg + curry sauce - loved the combo of crispy fried chicken with a flavorful sauce. They give you A LOT of rice too!  For breakfast I would recommend their EGG SCALLION PANCAKE ROLL. We got the plain one and one with the pork floss. Both very delicious. I love the sauce they put in it!  We also got their sweet & sour pork ribs over rice w/ egg - the flavor of the pork was really good but the pork was a little dry, so this wouldn't be my first choice.",
