I can\u2019t tell you how long I have been waiting for a BBQ restaurant that actually tastes good ( I have tried all of them) these folks got it right and the prices are great.  I also loved the look and location of the restaurant. It\u2019s located in a nice neighborhood of ppl. I actually think everyone in that neighborhood will go there for family dinner because every time I go I see someone walking out of their house with their family to the restaurant lol.  The service is awesome. The folks really take care of you even when the restaurant is crazy busy. Everyone there has an inviting smile on their face.  I suggest that you get to the restaurant early and try their wings. I can honestly say you will never find anything like it! The flavors are sooo good.  I know it might sound crazy but you must try the Brussels spouts. I could never eat these as a child but I saw some one eating these so I asked them if they were good and they said yes. i figured everything else was good so why not try them. I swear these will have you trying to figure out how they made Brussels sprouts taste like heaven haha .  I give this place an A++ and I highly recommend you check it out when you are in DC.",
