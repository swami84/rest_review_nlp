I had a bbq chicken plate and in my sides there were two roaches and a fly mixed in the cucumbers and cabbage.....look at the glass windows they have flys huge horse flys all over their restaurant. Huge let down since I use to go to them when they were known as Brian's BBQ... absolutely nasty...to see big bugs in ur food. Can't believe they passed a health inspection but again its hawaii to most places tend to be dirty and cut corners. 12/14/2020 no more.",
