Food took about 15 mins, but I have no issue waiting for quality food. We got 2 of the Stuy burgers and truffle fries. The flavors were OFF THE CHARTS! The cheese is high quality, the beef was cooked to a perfect medium, and the truffle fries were thick and savory. Not to mention the onions and mushrooms which were UNREAL! The brioche bun was also perfectly thick and soaked up all the burgery goodness.  I am a light eater, and could have easily split one burger with a friend. these burgers outshine every single $20+ burger I have had in the past year.",
