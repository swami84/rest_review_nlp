Just four outdoor tables, so ample space between you and other guests with a very toasty heat lamp above and a nice cover for the chairs. Lovely, kind and courteous service and the food was divine.  We started with the scallop corn fritters (with a coat of crunch that is the perfect entry point to the flavor waiting inside). I had the green risotto (creamy and delicious), and my partner had raving reviews for the shrimp udon, which was also our servers favorite dish of the house.  The desert was equally divine \u2014 a chocolate walnut crushed croissant cake (the name escapes me) which gave your mouth a beautiful (and not too sweet) journey through texture.  Neighborhood gem! And their coffee is fantastic as well (used to be my office-walk commute go-to).  Easy to make reservations.",

They severely mismanaged the food. There simply was not enough and after the event, my friend who organized tried to work out some kind of fair compensation w/the bar, for all the guests paying and getting - maybe one bite of a dish if they were lucky? (Seriously, they promised 6+ plates of a dish and came out with 2, for our group of 22 over 4 hours)  I didn't mind not getting to eat that much even if i paid because it was for a friend - it was seeing my friend trying to negotiate with the general manager afterwards which was actually the most off-putting and unreasonable - someone definitely did not manage the ordering or preparation for this well at all and it seemed like they were just trying to cover for themselves... at my friend's expense. Extremely unprofessional.  Maybe others will have a better experience here, but I would not recommend booking an event here. Get everything in writing and take photos as evidence.",

Before I was able to hold the candy, the woman snatched the candy jar from under my fingertips and says \"these are for guests only, sorry\" and takes a slight jog into the back area of the bar and sends her manager to the front.

A confluence of straight lines and curves all of which frame your attention to the large bar. The drinks were delicious and the bar staff very attentive and friendly - I could see myself coming for after work cocktails as well as a nightcap. I would have been content with just drinks, but the biggest surprise for me was how delicious the food was. The udon noodle dish was unique and something I would both recommend and like to try again - and the deviled eggs to start also shouldn't be passed over. Check it out!",
