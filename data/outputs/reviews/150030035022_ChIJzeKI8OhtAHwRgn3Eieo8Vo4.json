In my last three attempts to order delivery from the Beretania Pizza Hut I did not get what I ordered. The first time this happened I had ordered two personal pan pizzas - one cheese and one pepperoni- and an order of cheese sticks ... simple. Instead, what I received was two cheese personal pan pizzas and an order of cinnamon sticks. Not even close Beretania Pizza Hut. Just tonight, we ordered two personal pan pizzas - like usual, one cheese and one pepperoni, and then one order of cheese sticks and one order of cinnamon sticks. However, unfortunately, as the trend has become, our ordered was delivered and it was wrong, again. Tonight I received a whole other order of breadsticks that I did not need and did not receive the cinnamon sticks that I actually had ordered. At this point, I'm very peeved. It's not that difficult to complete the same order I put in with literally 3, maybe 4, items. I called the main hotline I guess, 643-1111, and the guy who answered asked if I wanted store credit or to be reimbursed. I really want to be reimbursed, because there is no way I can guarantee that my order will be correct if I take the store credit. So the guy on the hotline asked if I could hold on while he called the manager at the Beretania Pizza Hut, and I did. Then he came back on the phone and told me that he spoke to the manager and he would call me back in 10-15 minutes ... Well I've been waiting for 45 minutes at this point. Enough time for me to express my distaste for Beretania Pizza Hut delivery. Just remember if you order delivery from this pizza hut, the Beretania Pizza Hut, then check your entire order BEFORE the driver leaves. There's no guarantee your very simple order will be correct. By the way, if a zero rating was possible, that would have been my ultimate rating.",

If I wanted to order the ten dollar pizza I would have to cough up about double that which I did because I was already there. I would have ended up wasting money on gas. They should make a law that requires businesses to post a big sign that says that they do not participate in a national ad or something. To sum it up the pizza was definitely not worth the almost twenty bucks I paid for it. Next time I won't be visiting this restaurant. Funny how the local version of this franchise makes it sound like the pizza is a deal. No, it isn't. You're basically paying for a flat bread with tomato sauce, cheese and some meats. And the slices of the meats are so small. You'd think that the meats cost a fortune to them.",
