I've ordered from Kuun approx 5 times and have had nothing but wonderful experiences. From the soups to the barbecue, everything is SUPER delicious. My favorites are the galbitang soup, tteokboki, kimchi pancakes, and the pork belly gimbap. SO GOOD!!!!!! The bbq galbi is super flavourful and tender and delivers well but I think it's best to have in person. Everything else delivers super well. Also, if you're a kdrama fan and have got the weird urge for food you've never tried-- ORDER FROM THIS RESTARAUNT. They are the only place in Brooklyn that I'm aware of that sells jajangmyeon!! It's super delicious and when you order they sauce and noodles come separately so nothing is soggy. Overall, I'm super fortunate that good, classic Korean food is easily available and look forward to my next order!",

As a Korean person, I\u2019m so glad we finally have some good Korean food in Downtown BK and can\u2019t wait to dine in once that\u2019s available!  EDITED as of 11/6/2020 Unfortunately, the quality of the food has gone down pretty significantly since their opening. I live in the same building, so I ordered several times in the last few months and each time, I\u2019m more disappointed than the last. I ordered donkatsu for the first time a few months back and it was nice and thick and just as the photo advertised. Then when I ordered it again a few weeks later, it was significantly thinner and almost too hard to chew. I decided to give it one more shot tonight and ended up with another skimpy batch of paper thin meat.... for $19. See pics. Super disappointing. This will be the last time I order from Kuun.",

        "caption": "Yummmm! I was so excited to see a Korean restaurant open up nearby that looked like it offered things you can eat in Korea, not watered down menu.  The flavors of everything were fantastic. I had the spicy samgyeopsal fresh veggies box and grabbed a side of the trial ban Chan too.  The banchan was all different than explained in the menu, but it was all still very delicious! (The menu notes that it is subject to availability)  My only sad thing was there was no kimchi with the meal or sesame leaf included. I think next time I will call to ask to be sure the sesame leaf is included and about the banchan becuase I got two servings of the same thing.  I will definetly eat at this place often. It\u2019s so good and the flavors are fantastic. I\u2019m so happy there is a korean place nearby that offers a lot of great options and good ssam included with your meal so you don\u2019t have to prepare it at home.  Oh, they have some of the best samjang ever here.",

We tried a number of things - sweet & spicy boneless fried chicken, wings with soy sauce, trial kimchi variety and kimchi fried rice / bulgogi! Amazing flavors, taste and spice...we will be back to try more of the menu. \ud83e\udd62\ud83c\udf5b",
