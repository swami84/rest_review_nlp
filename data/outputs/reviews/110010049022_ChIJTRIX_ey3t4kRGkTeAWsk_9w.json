We were aware of our reservation. We were almost done, and our bottle of wine almost down, but we were in the mood  We asked our server if we can still order, telling him we have limited time left. He said it should be ok,.so we ordered one more. Then someone came to apologize for the delay. Maybe he is the manager or perhaps owner. Twice we were told about the delay. Finally it came. And when we just started to eat, the lady by the door told us our reservation is over. I tried to explain the situation, but she said she cant do anything. We didnt want to make a scene, so we stood up and asked that our food be taken out. Surely, the other new customer could have been accommodated on another table while we finish our meal. So disappointed. Also, it is a Chinese resto and it is Chinese new year. Surely the staff can be taught of a greeting on this important and auspicious day. It is just 4 syllables. I greeted the server and he was clueless and just laughed at what i said.",

I placed an order in advance, only to have it be cancelled by Door Dash at the time it should have been arriving. The restaurant offered the excuse that they are having issues with Door Dash, but could not explain why they continue to have the service listed on their website as one of their officially endorsed delivery services. If the service is causing them to leave their customers high and dry, you would think they would at least remove the link from their website until they are able to resolve their disputes with the company. The meal was for a celebration of the lunar new year; for my family, this is like being stuck with no dinner on Thanksgiving. The manager I spoke with refused to admit any culpability and somehow thought gift certificates would make up for the ruined holiday, for which he offered zero empathy or apology, just continued to blame Door Dash and thought my frustration with the situation was somehow unreasonable.  Is the food any good? I have no idea.",

Our bartender was exceptionally descriptive and helpful with guiding us through what we were experiencing.  One of the best and unique culinary experiences I've ever had. I cannot recommend tiger fork highly enough.  EDIT: A year and a half later, this place still stays true as one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I think of it often, when I eat similar style, albeit worse, food. Please, if you read this review, give this place a chance. You will remember the uniqueness for years to come.",

I do not understand how this restaurant is so overhyped.  At the restaurant, you order your food through their App and pay instantly, it was convent, but staff did not seem to care about our table once we paid for the meal.  We had a table at the outdoor patio, and we could not fully enjoy the atmosphere because the restaurant's window was boarded up like it was a war-zone. When the weather got a little bit unstable, a waiter came with boxes and said that we must leave now because of the rain. It was understandable, but you expect to hear something more when you just finished the appetizer and were waiting for the main dishes.  The first main dish came in a box, but we had to wait for the other one and moved inside of the restaurant. We waited for 10 minutes, and nobody brought us anything. Then I asked one of the staff members who were chatting with each other about the status of my order, and it turned out that it was not cooked yet.... 15 minutes later, we got the other dish.  Once we got home with a bitter experience at the restaurant, we hoped to enjoy the food. Well, it was tasteless...",

Also, was a bit disappointed that after making reservations weeks in advance that they sat us at the \u201cchefs table\u201d bar next to the kitchen.

        "caption": "Smashed Cucumber Salad (4/5 NOMs) Sometimes eating veggies is not just good for you, but also tastes amazing, like this starter \u2013 Smashed Cucumber Salad. I won\u2019t deny, we were a bit surprised about the size of it. Though maybe it\u2019s normal, as this comes from the Dai Pai Dong menu section which refers to a type of open-air food stalls in Hong Kong. There are no crazy toppings or seasoning here, it\u2019s a simple dish containing cucumbers, garlic, chili, and sesame. The combination of drinks and this salad are a great way to start a very nomnom dinner. While small, it\u2019s great for sharing; two guests can easily share one but order a few for a larger group. I guess it\u2019s called smashed because instead of cutting them, they smashed the cucumbers? I wonder with what and how. Maybe we should try smashing at home?  Beef Chow Fun (5/5 NOMs) Time to move onto the main course with a good Beef Chow Fun from the rice and noodles section. We are a big fan of wide rice noodles and were super excited to dig into this one. Plus, we were very hungry at this point. Beef Chow Fun is a staple of Cantonese cuisine originally from Hong Kong, and it\u2019s so common that at this point everyone has tried their own take on it. If a restaurant can\u2019t make this right, then you may as well leave. You can tell by our good rating that they did not disappoint at Tiger Fork. We are big fans of the thick rice noodles, bok choy, and juicy brisket that pulled this dish together. If you\u2019re a fan of Beef Chow Fun and noodles, then this is a perfect dish for you. We enjoyed this dish so much that we left the plate sparkly clean.  Fried Rice Chicken & Chinese Sausage (4/5 NOMs) When going to a Chinese restaurant, it\u2019s almost obligatory for you to order fried rice, and at Tiger Fork, we are starting with Fried Rice Chicken & Chinese Sausage. We are big fans of Chinese sausage, which you can buy at any H Mart or other Asian markets. Portion-wise it\u2019s perfect, and enough to share with a large group.  Fried Rice Fish & Prawn (5 NOMs) This isn\u2019t just any rice, it\u2019s Fried Rice with Fish and Prawn. We actually like this one more than the Chicken & Chinese Sausage version. Portion and price-wise, both fried rice dishes are identical. You won\u2019t go wrong with either one, but we felt that this one was better.  Humble Plate of Chili Wontons (3/5 NOMs) It\u2019s always good to be humble, but that\u2019s not us, so we eat humble like a plate of Humble Plate of Chili Wontons. The presentation is fun with these little bites floating in the spicy sauce. These wontons are stuffed with shrimp, chicken, and ginger. Even the spicy sauce didn\u2019t hit that much-needed spot.  Pork Ribs (5 NOMs) A beautiful presentation and amazing taste make for our favorite dish of the night \u2013 the Pork Ribs. Not much to say here besides the fact that these ribs are amazing! Covered in soy, ginger, and Happy Lady spice which is also known as Lao Gan Ma Chili Crisp Sauce. These ribs were cooked to perfection with meat that falls off the bone. With so much sauce, it makes for one very messy dish. Good thing they give you some wipes! However, we all know that you will lick your fingers clean. It\u2019s so good, maybe even a neighbor\u2019s finger.  BBQ Platter (5/5 NOMs) It\u2019s the one plate of meat to rule them all \u2013 the BBQ Platter with three different kinds of meaty goodness in one! What\u2019s not to love with its crispy pork belly, char siu (Cantonese roasted pork), and soy chicken? Plus, served with some side sauces, veggies, and rice. Every piece of meat was so good that we just naturally enjoyed it slowly to savor every bite. Our favorite (no surprise), was the crispy pork belly. The rice was also surprisingly good, very sticky, and soft.",

Let me preface this by saying I\u2019ve lived in nyc and Chinatown was my FAVORITE area for food. I definitely consider myself to be somewhat of a noodle enthusiast. So since I\u2019ve moved to DC I\u2019ve been on the hunt for a place to get some good noodles. I first saw tiger fork on Instagram and immediately wanted their beef noodle soup that was advertised, it looks delicious as well as the chili wontons. I went last night and the waiter first had no idea Tiger Fork had beef noodle soup, it wasn\u2019t on the menu and he said he\u2019s been working there for several months and never heard of it (they posted the soup two weeks ago). We ended up ordering the beef chow fun and chili wontons. The beef was bland and lacking flavor, the noodles were also flavorless. I asked for some chili oil to spice it up and the CHILI OIL HAD LITTLE TO NO FLAVOR which I\u2019ve never experienced. All in all I\u2019d say it was an okay meal. Not great, not terrible just bland.",

Went to TF with the same friend I went to Chiko with for the first time.  In comparison, almost every dish at Chiko had an amazing taste that we couldn't wait to try again.

Ordered the BBQ Plate Combo, and it was pretty much a sampler to try various types of food. My favorite is the crispy pork belly, where it was really crispy, and the meat was tender. The char siu is pretty tasty. The soya chicken was average, but nothing amazing. Overall, the food quality was good.  My only complaint is the bubble waffle where the waffle is below room temperature, which should be hot considering it should just come off the waffle maker; however, they just have these pre-made sitting on the waffle maker so they aren't made to order where you can enjoy it more like you would at other cafes that sells bubble waffles.",

It's just off the beaten path, hidden down an alley way, giving it a very hidden gem feel. Once inside the little touches make all the difference.  For dinner we started with the fish balls appetizer--it was melt in your mouth amazing! Then we had the whole fish, which was fried in a sweet and sour sauce, the chicken fried rice, and the beef chow fun noodles. To top it off with the Milk Tea was amazing, a tired and true classic down to perfection. Each dish had its own original spin. You'll just have to try it yourself to see what's in store.

After being seated, the server did not come back to our table for about 15 minutes. We immediately placed our food and drink orders. The food came out first and within 7 minutes, the waitress asked us if we were ready for the check. I had not even gotten my drink yet! The server apologized about the drink and brought it to me a few minutes later but then asked again if we were almost done with dinner and whether we wanted a box for our leftovers. We had the food for only 10 minutes and she was already trying to kick us out!  Lastly, on our way out, we heard another server telling a separate table about the \"daily specials,\" which our server never told us about. The food was alright, nothing to rave about, but the service made the experience awful.",

The only reason I'm giving them an extra star is because of the BBQ quail. Other than the food, it looks cool but I don't think it's cool enough to pay $50 per person for a meal like this.",

There was some Chinese lettering written above. Although we were looking for it we weren\u2019t as fluent in Chinese as we thought. Lol. Tiger fork has a unique ambiance with the bar front and center. There\u2019s a long table in the middle and several other tables on the side of the room. All the way in the back of the restaurant is the kitchen fully open for everyone to see. We skipped what looked like a small wait. And were directed toward two seats at the \u201cchef\u2019s table\u201d a counter right in front of the kitchen.  Our server greeted us in no time although they were super busy. We came on a recommendation for a while fish menu item. We were directed to the market fish. Just the description alone was enough to get our mouths watering. No more than 15 mins later we saw, what we hoped at the time,  were our identical dishes being plated. The dorade, a white fish, was filleted cut into tasty chunks, fried, and tucked under the remaining body of the fish which was also fried and contained more edible chunks. The jasmine rice came on the side in a small separate bowl. The presentation was eye catching to say the least. And the sauce... OMG the sauce was AMAZING. The meal is a pretty big portion (as a some for later guy I was happy to get a doggy bag) so the $32 price tag was justified. Overall an excellent menu item. I would definitely go back. As the menu item is a bit vague I\u2019m sure they have other types of fish that come in similar preparations. So the dorade may not be there forever but it def worth the trip to see what their next market fish dish is!!  Delicious sauce Filet fish fried Presentation was amazing Served with jasmine rice $32",

Their fun cocktails supposedly detox, energize, calm anxiety, heal and there's an aphrodisiac blend that could come in handy. Ours (the 8 o'clock for fatigue - it has ginseng - & the classic with gin - it has gin & chili oil ) were delicious and playful though gimmicky - all I wanted was a good Buzz and got a weee one. The eggplant dish was way too salty for my taste, the wanton was way too oily (keto?) but delicious, and the egg noodle shrimp dish was phenomenally phenomenal comfort food so stupid good we ordered two servings. Dreaming about it. The bubble waffle dessert is ok, I disliked that it was served  propped up  on  a cushion of brown  paper; a plate or shallow dish would make a much better presentation. It too is playful though. The  service staff was kind & attentive, We drank a lot of water because they just kept pouring and pouring it. My friend and I left hydrated and happy to recommend Tiger Fork. Expect a fun and playful vibe.",

Next, Dan Dan noodles, ehhhh, noodles are way too soft, flavor not bad. Cheung Fun is not bad, worth giving it a try. Egg tart, I can get it at the Great Wall grocery in Virginia and is better. The Beef Chow Fun is like they just stir together the sauce with all the ingredients...disappointed. Chow Fun is all about power/fire of the wok and this just doesn't have it.

We definitely had a lapse in service in which adequate recovery was made (we didn\u2019t ask for it-just common industry standard.).  We ordered our main course at about 9:55 pm, it was around 10:25 pm when our BBQ platter came out and we were informed they were out of the other item we ordered, the Dan noodles.  We understand these things happen, but for 30 mins the chef never notified anyone that they only had X amount of Dan noodles left is a pretty big lapse in judgement.  And to also notify us whilst bringing out our platter saying \u201cwell I was going to bring your noodles out with this but chef said we are sold out.\u201d  My partner doesn\u2019t eat a lot of pork and she was very much so looking forward to Dan noodles.  Again, adequate recovery was made and we left happy, but this is certainly a teachable moment for you guys to improve your already awesome spot.

We found a spot near the wall at the bar to grab some drinks, and also ended up getting a few food menu items. The bartenders were awesome, helpful with drinks and just overall friendly and happy to be there! The drink with the burnt cinammon stick is amazing - though we can never remember what it's called! One of the food items we ordered was the bubble waffle ice cream. The first time it came out, honestly, it was inedible. The waffle could barely be cut into and the ice cream flavor was beyond weird. Our bartender not only immediately took it away upon notifying him, he also immediately went to inform the kitchen staff. He totally didn't have to do that, but wow what service. The kitchen manager came over to address the situation, and brought over a fresh dessert (waffle quality much more fresh) and a different ice cream. We did not expect such service recovery in a bar, so it was super refreshing.",

The scene is something out of the meatpacking district in NYC.  Great drinks followed by a simple menu that excels at letting you experience a journey into Hong Kong style cooking.  Family friendly but it is really a hot date spot.  I could start by explaining the meal (dim-sum, beef chow fun & beef and shrimp friend rice) but the experience is best explained with a question; Are you ready to drop your local chinese food provider?  Because you will!  Tiger Fork does not disappoint!",

The congee was decent but don't expect the same airy, crispy dough stick you'd find in Asia. The green beans was a bit undercooked but had a decent sauce. The char siu bun is not steamed. It seemed to be baked so the filling inside was dry. My friend complained about the bun and they were generous to comp all our food ($30 value). Couldn't give 3.5 stars but since they comped us, giving 4.  On a side note, they won't seat you till your whole patty arrives, but great service when it comes to booking reservations.",

They were all good (and boozey) and they add items to their drink menu seasonally.  After a bit we were offered a seat at the chef's counter where we got to watch all the chefs cook. It was so much fun - great atmosphere, high energy yet easy going at the same time. And you could tell they pay a lot of attention to detail in their cooking and presentation.  But....THE FOOD. You will legitimately never eat fried rice anywhere else ever again after trying theirs. Also, the ribs! Order them. And, the nice thing is there are vegetarian options, too. We tried the snow peas and the beans - both great. The cucumber salad is really refreshing. I liked the beans, but, warning, they are a bit spicy. I honestly would shut my eyes and point anywhere on this menu and have confidence that whatever dish it lands on will be delicious.  Also, the staff - the manager Glenn was so lovely. He made sure we had a top notch experience and honestly, it felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant for a while. He explained and recommended dishes, gave advice on what drinks to pair, and was just a really nice guy.  To sum it up, I live in Atlanta and was in DC for a conference when I ate there. I'm here again a week later and going back tonight.",

DC is doing something no other city seems to be doing. Refining authentic chinese dishes.  Most Americans do not even realize there is menu past cashew chicken and orange chicken.  This is very much American Chinese food.  Have you ever had Chow Fun? Have you ever had crispy pork belly from Eden? Have you had Chinese barbecue? Did you even know the Chinese have their own barbecue? Most likely not.  This is one of the best places to go for the first couple waves of refined Chinese foods. The dishes I had were perfection of foods I had been enjoying since I was a young man.  I have to start with the Chow fun with brisket. To die for. If you are unsure start here. Flavors are very close to Pad See Ew if you are a thai food fan. This is wide rice noodle dish! The textures are chewy and slimy! The sauce is delicious. They used a brisket which was soft and tender.  This is the best version of this dish I have ever had.  When I typically order this dish from authentic Chinese restaurants it comes with various issues.  For example, its not hot. All the noodles are stuck together. It is under sauced. The sauce only reaches half the dish. Its missing veggies. The meat is over cooked. So for Tiger Fork to nail this dish means a lot to me. Chinese food can be amazing when cooked correctly with passion. Tiger fork does just that. I had a couple of their other dishes too but I did not want to drag out this review.  The other dishes were also perfect. I look forward to trying the rest of the menu. I have to come back!",

The d\u00e9cor is a cross between a Chinese restaurant and a hip bistro, with ample brick and wooden benches accented by hanging lanterns. The herbal cocktails were creative but strange; it\u2019s like someone looked at some themes in traditional Chinese medicine and threw it into alcohol hoping it would work. The dan dan noodles only tasted spicy, with no depth of flavor backing it. The tofu and pork skin (Chili tofu) was actually pretty good-savory, umami, and a kick. The service was great, very attentive servers.",

The seafood fried rice and Chairman\u2019s Clams are a powerful combination, and my personal favorite. I could probably eat these dishes once (or twice) a day for the rest of my life.  For the vegetarians out there, rest easy. The Chili Tofu is as flavorful as it is sinfully delicate. Pair with the XO Asparagus for a rounded experience.  The herbal cocktails are as refreshing as they are addictive. Not to mention the pan-Asian beer selection is one of the more diverse I\u2019ve seen in DC. I highly recommend the (dangerously) easy-drinking Tiger Beer to start.  Finally, the staff, under the management of a seasoned GM, are some of the most fun people working in the industry today. Come ready to make new friends and relax.",
