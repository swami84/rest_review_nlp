If you've been to MingHin in the downtown or Chinatown locations, this one is very similar. There's a huge variety of dishes to pick from and everything is made very well, at least to my Asian palate. The only thing that is different is that this location also serves Japanese food, according to its name, but we didn't notice particularly what was on the menu.  The decor here definitely felt more swanky and sleek and the overall vibe felt very modern. Our servers were extra nice and attentive, since the restaurant had just opened, which I really appreciated. So glad to have an authentic Chinese restaurant in South Loop now!",

As one of their newly added listings to their ever growing empire, this location aims too satisfy more of your visual hungry than anything else. The food was decent, nothing wrong with the flavor. The pricing is well within expectations of a location sitting so close to the downtown area. The real issue at hand are the portion sizes. As many people know, Chinese food, specifically Cantonese cuisine, is known for family style food. Although we had a party of 4, the food to person ratio seemed to fall short. Honestly speaking, if you subtract the sashimi platter and the Dragon Roll, each person technically had one dish. Traditionally speaking, in the real world, that's great, perfect portion size; however, in the works of Asian culture, that's bad. You tend to want to have more than enough, to make sure there's plenty to eat and share. If it's exact, then there's no excess and some may feel bashful or even ashamed to order now when others are content with their portions. All-in-all, great interior, good ambiance, good (not great) food. I'd recommend going with a larger group to get more variety.",

I went on the second night of their official soft opening and I was not disappointed. The waitstaff is noticeably well-trained and the food was excellent. I hate to admit this but I really enjoy eating egg foo young. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on the menu so I had to order the shrimp efy. The shrimp was extra large and the patties were at least 5 inches in diameter. You can get efy cheaper in Chinatown but I didn't mind spending a few extra dollars. The other two dishes, Japanese soft tofu with pea tips and udon noodles with eggplant, were delicious as well. What a great addition to the neighborhood. Now I can easily walk to this location for dinner or dim sum which is served during all business hours. Hooray! I am looking forward to trying the Japanese cuisine when they begin offering it. UPDATE: Finally tried their dim sum and Japanese food. They don't have all the same dim sum items compared to Chinatown but still delicious! We tried an unusual sushi wrapped in cucumber slice -- very refreshing but falls apart unless you shove the whole piece in your mouth which I did. We also had the preserved egg congee and their lunch vegetable rice noodles dish. There's something here for everyone.",

I happen to ask if they served alcohol and was told they just received their license on Friday so they were set up to serve beer and wine with cocktails to follow next week.  Service - We had a 6:30 pm Sat. reservation and were warmly greeted and immediately seated at a table.  Our waiter, Gene was outstanding.  He was extremely personable, attentive and conversant in English and Chinese.  He even pointed out some entrees that he thought we might enjoy more based on some of the questions I asked.  We also noticed that that other supporting servers were lightning fast discretely filling water, removing dishes and clearing tables like a swat team.  They were obviously making a great first impression.  Food - I'm Chinese and am probably overly picky about the quality/type of ingredients used and presentation at Chinese restaurants.  All of the appetizers/entrees selected were outstanding and the portions were very generous served piping hot.  My family jokingly noted the food more than met the Chinese mother test.  Decor - The restaurant displays a modern Asian decor that is impressive, inviting and comfortable.  The tables are generously spaced with leatherette large chairs and it was very conversation friendly.  We noticed the banquettes looked very spacious too so we will definitely request one next time.  Although the second floor was not open yet, our waiter invited us to take  a quick tour and we found it to be very impressive. It appears   they intend to serve Japanese food there with a sushi bar and dining table space built to replicate individual Japanese teahouses that seat up to about 6 people. We hope to give that a try as well.  Parking - Street parking and a public lot (small) next door.  However, it sounds like they may be setting something up to validate parking somewhere nearby.  Overall, Ming Hin (South Loop) is an excellent addition to their portfolio of restaurants but by far the best one we have tried.  I just wish they would open one in the Near North/Streeterville area next.  Kudos!",
