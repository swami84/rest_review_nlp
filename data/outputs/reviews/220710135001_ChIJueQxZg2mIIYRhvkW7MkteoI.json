Well, then this might be the place you want to visit after browsing through the strip clubs on bourbon street.  You could also find yourself in a group of Muslims whose first job while visiting a new place is to look for signboards  of 'Halal' in that case you might not have any other choice.  The third reason you might visit this place is if you suddenly get a craving of roti/naan and curry while visiting french quarter.  Beware of some other comments below of people from India who think that the management is racist towards Indians. I am a Pakistani so i cannot comment on that. The owner was friendly with us.",

I was in town for a conference a few weeks ago and was looking for someplace close to my hotel. Indian is my favorite takeout and there aren't many options in NO for vegetarians, so I thought I would give this place a try. The place is definitely a dump, so not a dinner destination. I ordered palak paneer (spinach with paneer cheese): the spinach was a puree and tasteless, the paneer was like chunks of sponge. I also ordered vegetable pakora, which turned out to be deep-fried breaded onion straws--mostly breading and fat. I'd recommend you try someplace else.",
