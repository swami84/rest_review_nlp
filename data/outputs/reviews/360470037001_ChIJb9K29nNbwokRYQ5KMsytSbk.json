        "caption": "I was tracking this place like a hawk when I overheard during their construction period that this was going to be a Thai place, which this area was in desperate need of. On the FIRST day that they opened, I walked in late, I might have even been the last order of the day, and since that day, every time I walk by, I'm just so happy they're here.  Everything about the place is charming, the people, the decor, the size (they made amazing use of the tiny space).  My favorite: Pad Kee Mow. Some Thai places don't have it (why? I don't know. It's the best thing), so the fact that they had it was a huge score. When you get the veggie, they still include some tofu in there (YES!), and the veggies they provide are way better (in quality, variety and amount) than most places. And adequately spicy. I tend to inhale my Thai food (because it's comfort food, yo), and let me tell you, even though you end up finishing earlier than you liked, because it's that good, the fullness will hit you.  Mango Salad: So good. That's all I have to say about that. It's spicy, it's refreshing. It makes me happy.  Sriracha Wings: It's good. And that crisp on it...man. It may be the crispiest hot wing I've ever had. Truthfully, I don't know if I'd order it again.  But if you're in the mood for spicy wings, it's worth an order.  Grilled Pork Skewer: Worth ordering and re-ordering.  Chicken Satay: Skipable. It's not bad. It's just not stand out like the other items I've had thus far and I think if you comparing meat on sticks, the flavor on the pork wins out.  Thai iced tea: Good. Worth ordering here. Not crazily sweet, not powdery tasting. Very enjoyable (so enjoyable in fact that after the first time I had it here, I had to start making my own Thai iced tea at home because I kept craving it).  I can't wait to make my way through the rest of menu. Clearly, I have many things to hit up, though it'll be hard since I'm so loyal to my veggie Pad Kee Mow, especially since they do it so, so right here.  They do have lunch specials here, if you're into that sort of thing.  Just a note: the doors need an extra strong pull/push because they tend to suction close. The handles on the outside are also skinnier than you'd like, so you need to really pull.",
