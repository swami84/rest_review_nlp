After inquiring about the options, Tristan recommended the classic tonkotsu as one of the staple ramen bowls of the shop, so I ordered that and it came out wonderfully quick - wow! The bowl was overall great. The noodles were cooked to perfection at the ideal point of al dents so that they were absorbing all the broth wonderfully. The broth itself was good broth, but can use a slightly less amount of fat. The egg should be marinated just a slight bit more too to give a sweeter taste to it. Finally, the pork belly was superb and delightful to the taste. I\u2019d recommend trying this place out if you\u2019re a ramen junkie like me!",

I was coming from the gym and quite hungry, after fasting for over 18 hours.  I ordered the level 3 (of 4) hell noodles, and shrimp dumplings.  The shrimp dumplings were so good, but those noodles, FIRE!!!   Oww wee!!! I challenged myself to eat the whole bowl without a drop of water, and succeeded.  I only needed 3 sips of water afterwards.  I'm bad@$$.  Sidenote, I had to eat the noodles without my glasses on because I was in constant tears.  Also, I blew my nose no less than 20 times, and I had Noooooooo sinus issues before eating.  Will be back again for the hell 4 noodles soon.  May even video it.  Yes, i got takeout too.  The average meal will cost you $10 to $20 dollars.  Service at this location (Hyde Park) was very good, and people were getting takeout.",

Green tea mochi (the only dessert they have) tastes good but a bit too soft, should be more frozen for best texture and division of pieces.",

I had been to the Chinatown location several times in the past and would say that the experience is similar. Items on the menu are the same, although this location is much more spacious, bright, and less loud.  My friends and I came around 6pm on a weeknight and there was no wait. By 7pm though, 2-3 parties were waiting for tables. We got the kuro buta tsukemen and tonkotsu, which were served within 10 minutes of ordering. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of their noodles. They are straight (not curly) and have more of an al-dente texture that feels harder to the bite than most ramen noodles. The broth was good though, very umami, not too salty, and very heavy on the sesame flavor. The tonkotsu ramen only came with one piece of meat, which was a bit underwhelming, but the rest of the bowl was good. Even though we came for ramen, I love that Strings also has great rice bowls, sashimi, and vegetarian options.  The new restaurant has a nice variety of seating and decor but service was a bit all over the place, as I expected for a new restaurant. I'm sure it'll improve as they settle in business, and will definitely be back!",
