Im pretty sure these were leftover noodles from the previous day as they were way too soggy. Omg it was totally different and had a ton of sprouts in both dishes I ordered. Crazy. It is like someone just threw a bunch in there to annoy the customers. I ordered pad thai and pad see ew and both were infested with sprouts. Also the carrots are too much as well. The noodles were soggy this time around and the food was just wasn't tasty. The cook got lazy or this was reheated noodles. Very disappointed in this food.

I chose to try to eat some of the rice anyways because I was very hungry and pressed for time.

If you are a spiciness connoisseur you can try the extra hot!  Last time I was in, I saw a visitor get 20x extra hot and he started sweating immediately (so be warned!). Also the egg rolls are amazing, the staff is nice. My only complaint is that the smoothies aren't offered at this location. Hopefully in the future!  Also be warned there is not a bathroom.",

Just sweet. Big disappointment especially as I picked it up to burn a cold out of me today. Same darn thing w/ noodle dish- pad Khe ma. Please, Pho's don't warn about heat when your menu says it's spicy, and classically it's supposed to have some heat- we know we're ordering a spicy dish. This again in \"mild\" had NO SPICE at all. \ud83d\ude29 Very happily surprised though by the three free crab Rangoon in my bag, that were absolutely delicious! One of the best I've had! Just wish I knew they were in there, as I didn't go straight home so I didn't eat them till later when they were getting cool. I will go back for some of those again though.",

In short, considering it's been well over a year since I cycled, I didn't want to cycle any further up north from our starting point downtown, so I was happy Pho's Spicier Thai was our option to stop in this area. This was my first time here. After buying some much needed cold brews across the street, we sat down at our table where we were greeted right away with some menus.  It's small and quaint, and the wall is decorated with pictures of people that have taken up their spice challenges. My date and I immediately decided we didn't want to take part lol, so our meal choices were as far from spice as possible.  We started with the fresh spring rolls, which were just okay to me. The rolls were a little dry for my liking. For our entrees, my date ordered the Musman curry and I went with the Pad Woon Sen noodles, both with tofu, and both which we shared.  The Musman Curry was awesome! Seriously flavorful. My Pad Woon Sen noodles were also pretty good, but nothing amazing.  The service was great. The staff were all super nice. They were on it with the water refills, and they checked up on us often to make sure we were ok.  All in all, a great place for some quick Thai food.",

The restaurant is very small and personal, the whole dining area is limited to about 6 tables, and is usually staffed by just a cook and waitress. The staff is very friendly and fast, and the food is consistently delicious. Also, the meals are very reasonably priced, the lunch specials typically cost about $7.  If your feeling bold, you can try to do one of Pho's spicy challenges, anything over 2X spicy gets you on the wall of fame and your meal is free. Be warned, its not for the faint of tongue!",

What's awesome is that you can customize the heat in each dish... and they actually do it.  I've been to many restaurants where the \"hot\"... really isn't that hot.  Here you can get \"hot\" or \"xtra hot\" or \"2x\" or on and on! Love this place.  Definitely my go to Thai place in the city now!",
