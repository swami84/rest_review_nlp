A full order looks like about 20 pieces of chicken wings and a half order is 10 wings. Because it's made to order, you'll have to wait about 10 minutes after you order.",

        "caption": "I absolutely love this place for very quick, basic, and good value Korean classics like bibimbop and tofu soup.  This place is off to the side of the Palama Supermarket when you first walk in the door.  Make sure you know what you want to order before getting in line.  The board is big enough to read at a distance.  They are quick in processing your order and expect you to be quick in giving your order.  It isn't unfriendly, just a \"move it\" environment.  Everything is good and made fresh.  The turn around from order to tray is amazing.  Food comes out hot and well plated.  Portions are just right to fill you up or have a little left over for later.  The best thing is the price.  It is affordable and a good value.  These days that is really hard to find.  Besides, you know the food has to be good because of all the Korean Aunties working so hard in the kitchen.  Another good thing is the healthy options.  There are the fatty and protein typical plates, but lots of other options to pick from as well.  Korean food in general has always given me a feeling of being healthier they other foods because of the amount of vegetables they use.  The dinning area is a typical shared dinning area that can get a little unkept looking during busy periods, but I personally feel that is a lot cleaner then a mall food court and don't mind just wiping down my table with an extra napkin, so suck it up if you're a germaphobe or to be safe, just do take out and enjoy where ever makes you feel most comfortable.  I do eat here frequently and do highly recommend checking it out if you never have been and enjoy good Korean food.",

You can also find Tofu soup,    Meat jun, and lunch plates. The meal prices are very, very good.
