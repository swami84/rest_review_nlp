I however noticed on their google profile that they identify as LGBT+ friendly and are women led. While they may claim that, I feel the need to set the record straight. Being women-led does not necessarily mean they are supportive of women and women's issues. They had a virulent response to participating in a fundraiser about supporting women's healthcare awhile back and have ties to a heavily anti-LGBT religious group in Moscow. While I understand a business is made up of human beings that have their own ideologies they follow, I don't support the idea of claiming to be something that you're not. If you don't support women's autonomy and you support anti-LGBT stances that's your call but be honest about it and don't pretend to be something you're not because it's what will help you make money.  EDIT: Since I can't respond to a response on my review.. I never said Slice wasn't women-led, I simply said that doesn't mean they support women's rights though by the women-led label, it would imply they do. I know that the owner's response to a fundraiser for women's healthcare was publicized and it was absolutely unprofessional. If you don't agree with providing healthcare to women through PP you can politely decline. That was not the case. I have no qualms with Slice and have supported them in the past, I don't appreciate companies labeling themselves as advocates when their true beliefs say otherwise.",

My boyfriend and I have been coming to slice fairly frequently since I moved to town (and before). The staff is always friendly, service is great, plenty of drinks on tap and the food is delicious!! Wish I had remembered to write this review before I inhaled my slice of \u201cMargherita\u201d pizza but hopefully you get the picture. \ud83d\ude01 A bonus, they have ice cream and a courtyard with a play place for your kids! During the warmer seasons this a great place to listen to music, laugh with friends and enjoy the sunshine and fire.  My favorite pizzas (in case you cared): - BBQ - Bacon wrapped date - Potato/Chicken Bacon Ranch - Margherita",

I went in and was greeted by Jon the bar manager. Although timid about my request, he made sure that he could accommodate our group. He worked with me throughout the process and made it one of the best experiences possible! The tables were ready, the food was ready and the bar was excellent with the order of our drinks. I wanted to make sure the review was focused around the service because 1) it was so superb, everyone we encountered was stellar and 2) the food doesn\u2019t need a review as it speaks for itself. This was an amazing experience and will definitely be back here again.",

Well... I was embarrassed that I bragged about this place without firsthand experience, because it was nothing GREAT or to be excited about! First off, they were NOT busy but the man taking our order was acting as if there were tons of OTHER orders when he was rushing us as we decided what to order! He was not polite and lacked in customer service! We were a party of just 3 and there was no other patrons ordering or waiting for food but he was in a rush! We place our orders and specifically said no gravy on one of the biscuit breakfast sandwiches! He continued to persuade to just try it that it was the BEST!! We still declined politely no gravy please! We paid leaving a 15% tip which I wish I had not tipped after the experience continued to go downhill once the food finally arrived to our table outside. The same man whom took our order delivered our food sat it down in front of us and realized we didn\u2019t have silverware but said oh it\u2019s over there the silverware pointing to inside the building! Wanting us to get it!! Which is fine, but customer service was lacking! He could have easily gotten us our utensils making it a hospitable thing to do... but he didn\u2019t! Then, the order request of NO GRAVY came with the gravy!!!! We didn\u2019t want to cause any more \u201canxiety \u201c for this man, so we didn\u2019t return to get the order fixed! The man never asked how it was, nor did he say enjoy your meal! Clearly, he was not trained to be in customer service industry nor in hospitality industry! The gravy was NOT THE BEST!!! It was meek and flavorless and there wasn\u2019t a good portion on the two that DID request it! The biscuit was not your classic Idaho home style biscuit! It was pizza dough shaped into a biscuit! A disappointment especially since I was told by others that this establishment was good! It was not worth our $30+ dollars nor was it an experience I wanted to share with my out of town relatives whom have never been to Idaho! Idaho is famous for it\u2019s biscuits and gravy!!! I am sorry to say this, but skip this place and walk down to Bloom or The Breakfast Club for the BEST biscuits and gravy! Plus, you will get the customer service and hospitality that Moscow is known for! I have always supported new places of business in our town and I am unsure why people rave about this place! Perhaps the plethora of beer options mask the bad in this establishment or perhaps the breakfast isn\u2019t what people rave about! Perhaps, I came expecting the BEST BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE TOLD US IT WAS!!! Either way, I was embarrassed to have taken out of state relatives to eat here! What a disappointment in many ways! Also, wasps are everywhere and if you\u2019re allergic be on the lookout!!! There were no wasp traps anywhere and this is a concern! Eating outside is part of the experience but you have to ensure safety of your customers! I happen to be allergic to wasps, bees, etc and HAVE eaten outside other places but this environment with dirty dishes outside, standing water and food create the heavenly environment for wasps etc! Thank God I didn\u2019t get stung! The staff who \u201chelped\u201d us would have said and pointed the hospital is that way- like he did with our other customer service concerns!!!",

They have so many options for drinks like kombucha, coffee, soda, and alcohol. I still have yet to try their biscuits out, however I always hear great things about the portions you are given and the quality of the food is still amazing just like their homemade pizza's.  They have a lot of seating inside and outside. They also have a area where you can bring the little ones as well. Speaking of the little ones they also serve ice cream there as well which makes for a great little treat while spending some time with kids.  You can also find some live shows played there along with what is known as a tap takeover. For those of you who don't know what that is it's where a specific company that makes microbrewery beer comes in and takes over all their beer taps and serve mainly their brand that night. A lot of the time they use these to raise money for donations along with promoting their products.  All and all it's a great place to eat and drink and even bring the family.",
