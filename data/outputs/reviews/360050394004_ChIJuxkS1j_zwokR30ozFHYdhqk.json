The manager who would not give me his name that was in shift was absolutely rude to me. The pizza I received was a pepperoni pizza with bacon and sausage and hot wings. The manager did not tell me they did not have bbq wings. And substituted my wings for hot wings.Adter asking the manager on duty what he was going to do about the mess up he said exchange the order in a co sophomoric manner. I asked what could be do because I was going to have to wait a other 30 mins to get my pizza remade as well as wings. He was rude and stated give me back the pizza and wings I will give you another.  Y this time with his attitude I  didnt want to eat from here.i asked for a refund he refused. I told him I was calling the owner of the store. And he said \"F U\" I told him he would be fired. I will be following up with what ever manager that is above him tomorrow.",

But after I realized what his intention was when they closed, I noticed that the order I asked for him was supposed to take him to his house, as it turned out that they did not pick it up and he doesn't have to pay it or give any account to anyone. I hope that the way you eat it, it will come out and not be used by animals. Sometimes people build a business and by (people) like those with a bad attitude and unreasonable they lose the business by putting it in the hands of (people) like that (manager). I see why the place has such a low score 2.5 because they put helpful people not animals  (Original) El m\u00e1nager es un animal con ropa yo ped\u00ed una orden por internet para recoger y dicen que cierran a la 2 a.m. la ped\u00ed a la 12:30 am cuando fui a recogerla a la 1:30 am me dice el m\u00e1nager que el no me la entregar porque el sistema ya est\u00e1ba apagado  y el otro trabajador que hab\u00eda le dijo que lo cobrara cash y el dijo que no y punto. Pero despu\u00e9s me di cuenta cual era su intenci\u00f3n cuando cerraron me fij\u00e9 que la orden que yo ped\u00ed el la llevaba para su casa supuestamente como qued\u00f3 que no la recojieron ya el no tiene que pagarla ni rendirle cuentas a nadie. espero que como as\u00ed se la coma le salga y que no le aproveche por animal. Aveces las personas construyen un negocio y por (personas) como esas con mala actitud y poco razonables se les pierde el negocio por ponerlo en manos de (personas) como ese (m\u00e1nager). Ya veo porque raz\u00f3n ese lugar tiene tan baja puntuaci\u00f3n 2.5 pongan personas serviciales no animales",

He told me I cannot order and pay with card and have someone else pick it up. I said ok but I'm at work in Manhattan and I need my kids to get something to eat. He said no I was like ok. I called back spoke to someone else who told me I could place the order online, which I had an account so it wasn't an issue. I placed the order online. Why did the Manager call me back like he was sitting just waiting for the order to call me and  say he already told me I have to come in with my card and cancelled my order. Mr. Kevin the Manager you had nothing else to do but to watch my orders come in. So I called corporate and yes this is a corporate location and I asked about paying online with my card and been the one to pick it up. And I was told franchised location can ask for that or it can be change in policy but it's not restricted.  Not sure if the money came off my card. But I sure did report him, he was rude and had no good customer Service experience.  And I will be rating this store on every social media platform.  Sometimes Kevin you can make a judgment call especially If this is something that I do all the time. Everything on the account is the same and the order are always the same. This is the reason your store did not use machines to take people's order they used human beings so they could make judgment calls. Now my children have to wait over 2 hrs from the initial order. For me to get home to get something to eat. I was so mad I couldn't even make an account with another take out store. I decided to just go home.",

My order was placed and I got confirmation that it was being prepared. I went to pick up my order and it was cancelled!! Although I gave the allocated time for preparation. The clerk said that some orders are scams so he cancelled it. Please note that as a loyal customer I have NEVER placed an order and not picked up. I am very disappointed in this.",

Deliver did not even attempt to bring my order to the door. My pizza toppings were slid off the pie and all over the inside of the box it came in and my chicken pineapple sandwich (order from other dominos all the time) was the driest I've ever received. There was absolutely no sauce on my sandwich. I will not be ordering from this dominos again! Some retraining of the entire staff needs to take place. VERY DISAPPOINTING !!",

As I waited for my order, me and my mom kept calling to complain to the manager, but he would just disregard what we say and claim that the delivery is on the way. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 Anyways, I'm glad I don't have to order delivery from this place anymore.

Ive had a scenario were my driver left within 2 minutes of arriving , and the only reason why i didnt get to him was because my phone was off for a slight moment, doesn't seem right for the customers to wait an excessive amount of time and drivers can't even wait 5 minutes for us to get our food.

In the confirmation I was told that the order would take 2.5 hours. Let's be realistic here... I'm assuming they are a busy franchise seeing that I would have to wait 2.5 hours for ONE MEDIUM PIZZA AND HOT WINGS, but come on, if you're that busy, expand to keep your customers happy by not having to wait such prolonged periods of time, and also to avoid reviews like mine...  Also, Dominoes on the whole needs a better system where you get an estimated wait time before placing an order. That way, I can know whether or not my gut is willing to wait for 100 years to be filled. Like seriously, once I had received the confirmation email and saw the wait time, I immediately called to cancel the order, but who was I kidding, it's Dominoes, they're not going to do something so unimportant as answering a phone... So I was stuck with the order placed at 8:25p, that is supposedly still being quality checked at 12:30am by the lovely Claudia.... Thanks a lot Claudia :)  As I conclude this overtly sarcastic rant, I would like to say that I DO NOT recommend this location.  ****REVISION**** I apologize for the wrong info, they DO give you an estimated time before placing, I just did not notice it. On-the-other-hand, I NEVER received the pizza.",

After waiting another 45 minutes, I call the store and had to wait nearly 15 minutes to get a person on the phone for them to tell me that the driver just left again and it might take up to 30 minutes for them to get here with my item. So, I've been waiting over 3 hours for all my food to arrive. The customer service was terrible, I was pretty much told to wait it out. Never will I recommend this store, nor will I be ordering from here again. Id rather take my chances with Pizza Hut or something. This is the worst service I have ever received.

Although the tracker said the order was completed, it was not even in the oven when I went to pick it up. First no one would attend the counter - even though there was a front area full of people either waiting to pick up or place orders. When people finally did *feel* like coming to the front to wait on customers, most of us were told our orders weren't ready or that the wait time could be anywhere from 20 min to an hour.  At one point, employees in the kitchen area could be heard cursing and fighting with each other - refusing to leave their stations to help expedite service. When I asked about my order, people walked away and left me waiting for at least 5 minutes - yelling to each other that they couldn't find it and another yelling \"it's not my f-ing job to go put the wings in - people need to do their f-ing job.\"  After waiting another 5 minutes I had to ask for a refund. No one knew what was happening with the order - including the manager who looked completely unprepared or incapable of handling his staff.  I was not the only person requesting a refund.  Of all the Dominos I've gone to, this one is BY FAR the LEAST professional one. People can often be heard cursing at each other and the staff almost ALWAYS hides in the back or pretends they're too busy at their stations to assist customers, forcing customers to shout out for help. You could literally give away free pizza and if the staff is this horrible, confused and inefficient, it will always result in Dominos having a poor rating.",

I need my money back come hell and high water, will not order not even a wing from them. Employees are ratchet, no customer service whatsoever.

My hot wings were cold and my pizza was lukewarm. While one of the employees were apologizing to me for the inconvenience I curiously asked why won't their store deliver to my house, which is very close by driving distance. They said that they were in fact a delivery store even though the website says they are a carryout only store. Ive seen delivery drivers leave the store and come back in cars with the dominos logo on top of them. It ponders me who they are delivering to, because they can't deliver to me even though my house is 7 blocks away and only about a 3-4 minute drive. I hope somebody who works there sees this review and makes some improvements to the store.",

I never write reviews about my experience but im so over dominos, i dont know if its the store or just how the company operates but im just certainty never ordering dominos again!!!!!",

I gave them another chance and this time my pizza came cold and messy. I tried avoiding speaking to the reps and used the iphone app again and it said my pizza was in the oven...after 40 mins i called to check the status of my order and they told me its been on its way...20 mins later they called me to say they canceled the order and are not taking anymore orders..this is unbelievable, i could of ordered something else from somewhere else if i wasn't there waiting for dominoes. The night shift takes your orders and never bring your food, they see you calling and wont pick up. Its just unbelievable and sad that i have to call papa johns because i have no other option.",
