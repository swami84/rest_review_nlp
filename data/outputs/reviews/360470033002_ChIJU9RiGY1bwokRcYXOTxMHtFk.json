The staff was nice and food seemed to come out as quickly as they could make it.  The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is that the place is gross. Everything is greasy. Literally puddles by the fryer and a fine mist coating everywhere else. Maybe their ventillation system needs work or they need a new porter.  The staff don't wear their facemasks either. I'm not usually super bothered by that... but it was every single employee. Just thought the owner/manager should know so they don't get shut down by DOHMH.",

I ordered but then noticed the girl ringing the order was not wearing a mask nor gloves AND she was chomping on food like it was her last meal on death row. By the time I realized it I already ordered. I was too busy making sure I maintained my 6 feet distance which was impossible to do with 4 other people coming in behind me to pick up orders for Uber etc. Well I ordered which was quick but then had to wait because the guy behind the grill took a break to let his kid and baby mother in behind the counter and to some back room. When he came out he began our order. After that the kid came back out the room to the cooking area and asked his dad for something so pops had to go back there and tend to whatever the nugget wanted. Apparently he left for too long  because then I watched gloveless-maskless cashier girl step to the grill and man what pops left behind including my curly fries which came out overly cooked and hard. I can tell she was trying not to man the grill but finally gave in after 5 min of no sign of pops, the fry machine ringing, and meat cooking on the flat top. I owe pops a thanks for them most brutally crunchy curly fries. The food was sooo good don't get me wrong but the professionalism is missing. I think I'd wait to Philly for the original just off customer service alone.",

Either you understand what that means and I'm telling you something you knew long before reading this review, or you have no idea what I'm talking about and then it doesn't matter because you won't know what your missing anyway.  I gave this 5 starts because it it without a doubt the best cheesesteak your going to find IN NYC, so it has to get 5 stars.  Now for the actual review: the staff could with out a doubt be more friendly and professionally trained, but that will hopefully come in time  The cheesesteak its self is above avg but not great. Again, it's the best your going to find in the city. The bread is soft and fresh, and the steak is cut correctly, could use some more seasoning though.  The cheese its self is the biggest miss. I have been a coupe times and the cheese has not been that almost liquid consistency that your used to from a Philly steak, it's more of a think, almost mayo like consistency.  Short answer: if your craving a Philly and have the time, it's worth the trip. If you just kinf of want one, shorties or that cheesesteak truck that roams the city is all you need.",

The man who took our order (November 2 at 4:45) was difficult to deal with, and had an extremely hard time when I asked if I could order the pizza steak with chicken instead of steak, so I was like forget it, and ordered something else.  My boyfriend ordered his food, and then we sat down at the counters which were full of crumbs and pieces of napkins and generally dirty, to wait for our food.  We were on our way somewhere else so we had to eat there, so while we were eating, the man who took our order started screaming at another employee, because she apparently accidentally made an extra milkshake.  He continued to loudly berate her for a few minutes despite the fact that we were not the only customers in the open concept restaurant, and at one point shouted at her that she had to pay for it out of her paycheck.  Moments later he came over to my boyfriend and I and handed us a milkshake and said there was an extra made, and did we want it?  I asked \"did that employee have to pay for it?\" and he insisted she did not, and dropped it on the counter next to us. I am a person who has, and does work in the food service industry and the whole scenario made me so uncomfortable, that under the guise of needing more ketchup, I went to the pickup counter and asked another female employee if the milkshake was paid for by the girl that the man was shouting at, and she said it wasn't. I told her it made me uncomfortable, and I would pay for it so the girl didn't have to.  She said it was ok, and had been worked out, but as we left, the girl made eye contact with me through the window and mouthed \"thank you\" so I am glad I went out of my way to make a point of asking the man and the woman about it.  I hope the girl didn't have to pay for it, and I also am going to find a way to send this to corporate, because that man's attitude lost a native PA girl's business who was looking for a local spot with a taste of home.",

I had a cheesesteak and the meat was good but the bread was soooooooooo chewy. By the time I was done I could win \"world's strongest jaw\" ,if there is such a thing because of the workout I got.

While I have tried the Philly Cheese steak in Philly, I haven't had one in very long time. Passed by it and decided to try it. The ordering process easy enough. You got the steak chicken, pork or veggies. Add fries and sides as desired. Not sure if people don't know how to read as some people apparently can't from the reviews.  Additional toppings are $.99 and stated right on the menu. I certainly didn't expected it be free unless you are at Subway.  Service was ok. They took my order. I got my food. I would say it was a pretty good Cheese steak. I went with American, with jalapeno peppers and fries. Certainly, not an every day meal but good once in awhile.",

I finally went the other day and placed my order for a sandwich. The manager asks you how you want the sandwich and encourages more items on the sandwich and when you're given the total you realize all of those sandwich items are extra and not free. So my $10 sandwich turned into $14 sandwich. I asked if he had jalapenos and he said yes they had cherry peppers and Italian peppers. I asked for jalapenos. He said Italian peppers were like jalapenos. I get if a business does not have something to accommodate the customer then you're supposed to at least offer a substitution but don't tell me you have jalapenos and you don't. It's not the same. But he claims it's spicy. I order both peppers and I wait almost 20 minutes for my sandwich. One person was in front of me with one sandwich and I had to wait that long for my sandwich. At this point I'm still assuming it was worth it. I finally get the sandwich and I have not eaten a thing all day so I know my taste buds are going to be a little biased because I haven't eaten so they're going to go crazy over this right? Wrong. The sandwich fell completely flat. The meat was tender and the bread was soft but that's pretty much all I can say about the sandwich that was positive. The peppers didn't do anything to the sandwich and that actually cost me more money. The meat tasted like it had been cooked in water that was seasoned with only black pepper. There was barely any flavor at all. The cheese and bread provided more flavor. I was extremely disappointed. I have been living in New York for over 10 years and the food here just sucks. It's like they are terrified of seasoning their food and I'm really tired of it. It's just not worth what I paid and if they didn't have the word of mouth reputation they had and didn't have the name Tony Luke's the business would definitely go under. I'm seriously upset I wasted that amount of money and waited that long for THAT sandwich. Highly disappointed. But hey, now I know. It's all hype.",

Bread was tough, possibly stale. Cheese distribution was all over the place, I had mild provolone and about a quarter of my sandwich was missing cheese altogether while the center was overflowing. For $10 and their Philly reputation, you would think they would put a little more care into the thing. It was also missing the hot pepper and pickle station, which really bummed me out. If you absolutely, positively NEED to try a  \"Philly-style\" cheese steak, by all means, but it's not worth a return visit.",

Never mind you our sandwiches were already done for the past 10 minutes sitting there getting cold. The final straw was when were called again, we check our items to see if everything is correct and we were still missing another item. When we tell the manager he still tries to push us out ignoring what we said! Finally I had enough. I asked for a refund of the missing item. We weren\u2019t even able to enjoy our food due to it being extremely cold! Will I go back again? Maybe to the one in Philly! Brooklyn was one heck of an experience!",

I took a few bites then asked the counter staff if my order was correct. The meat was bland, the cheese was fine as was the bread.   Staff replied yes/no and offered a half-hearted apology but no new sandwich or any accommodations. She asked if I would eat it and I said no. She then ignored me to attend to a new customer.
