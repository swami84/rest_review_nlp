In the beginning service was great wife was so nice food was delicious. But I\u2019ve noticed once they get to know who you are the food becomes a problem. Like don\u2019t take my kindness for weakness. I might chit chat with them lol but no now you sending me burnt food. Let\u2019s talk about how they smile in your face one minute next minute in their native language it become a bit uncomfortable because she\u2019s talking and looking at you in the most nastiest way, then jimmy will turn around give you that look then play with the food nope sorry. With them being the only place to get fast food they will continue to provide shitty ass food and service. I CANT WAIT TILL GOLDEN CORRAL opens up and shuts their asses out. If we buying your food you should care bout your own customers cause if not for our cash that place sucks dirty old they cook off one grill everything taste the same. Fries taste like the frozen fish they fry like how yo pancakes and bacon taste like fish it\u2019s nasty. All that money to cheap to buy new appliances. I swear ima play lotto if I win ima snatch this place from under them and do what the neighborhood really needs and that appreciation!",
