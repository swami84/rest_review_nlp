        "caption": "As you walk into the Block DC PogiBoy is directly in front of you, its open arms and all. And if the illuminated menu didn\u2019t signal to you (SARAP!), the unmistakable aroma would. Although I hadn\u2019t yet heard of PB, a buddy of mine had, suggesting we try it out while another, joined after hearing plans. He\u2019d been before so that was obviously a sign\u2026  At 2:30 on Saturday, the Block was busy: all outside tables were taken with only one inside table available. Tables are socially distanced from one another BTW and, too, is where you\u2019ll find a QR code to access PogiBoy\u2019s menu aside from that above the pick-up/prep/kitchen section. Ordering virtually is the preferred method.  They have fried chicken. I ordered said chicken that is fried, and it was glorious. Perhaps I am partial to the Southern, Soul and comfort cuisine yet I make no apologies. The Pogi Fried Chicken Bucket reaffirmed my partiality.  Despite being served with a side of forgettable PogiBoy Cravy and seemingly basic shrimp chips, their chicken is a must-try.  Now, if I had reviewed the menu a bit more thoroughly, I would have simply ordered their Spaghetti Special, which my friend did, as it comes with two pieces. This said, I tried some of here spaghetti and found it, too, a must-try. AND that goes for any fans of Jollibee and/or Filipino spaghetti in general as PogiBoy\u2019s represents for sure. That sweet Bolognese might be a surprise if you\u2019re not ready for it but certainly welcomed, nevertheless.  To share, I ordered the Purple Mash Potatoes and the Blooming Sam \u201cPogi\u201d Ta while another friend ordered the Loaded Palabok Waffle Fries. Yes, purple mashed potatoes had a unique flavor but they\u2019re a pass. Another pass? THE WAFFLE FRIES. Shocking, I know. I couldn\u2019t get into them at all and wish I could say there was too much going on, too many flavors competing or something. Nope. Just wasn\u2019t a fan.  Lastly, the Blooming is another must-try! Imagine a leveled-up Outback\u2019s Bloomin\u2019 Onion and you\u2019ll have this. Such rich flavor with the right amount of spice that has my mouth watering as I struggle to find the words. You can certainly enjoy without the accompanying chili-crab fat mayo dip or with that\u2019s for sure. Part of me wouldn\u2019t mind trying it dipped in that sweet hotdog Bolognese (Fiesta Spaghetti). Next time... And there will be a next time for sure.  In closing, the one thing that I cannot leave without mentioning is how EVERYTHING I ordered was lukewarm or room temp. This was not a carryout or food delivery order. We ate INSIDE at the BLOCK. For instance, the Cravy/gravy had all but lovingly congealed already on both the fries and much like the chicken bucket side. Fried chicken is fine at any temp but I ate wondering how much better it would have been under a heat lamp if nothing else. The spaghetti? Same thing along with the Blooming Sam \u201cPogi\u201d Ta. IF they were warmer, how much better would they have been?!?  I\u2019ll be back to try a sandwich/burger or two and will bring friends to share those waffle fries for a second chance. PogiBoy is new-new and am confident they\u2019re still ironing out logistical kinks and QC. This isn\u2019t goodbye, PB, just see you another time.",

I don't usually eat burgers because American burgers can be too greasy or bland leaving a feeling of dissatisfaction after you finish it, but the combination of flavors in this burger including the pickled papaya and secret sauce works incredibly well that gives a burst of flavor with every bite. Highly recommended.",

The Pogi Burger was perfectly crispy and luscious and perfectly embodied the hybrid burger I was craving. The palabok waffle fries were crunchy yet the gravy and lemon weaved it's way into every nook and cranny. The Pogi Loco burger steak dinner was every bit as sinful and comforting as I'd imagined.",

        "caption": "Great restaurant! I went there Saturday evening of their opening weekend. It was understandably busy, but because we went later in the day the lines weren't as long anymore. So my advice - if you plan on going on the weekends, go towards dinner time (6-7pm), and you'll have a better chance of getting your food more quickly. If you go early you'll have to wait in line, and there's a backlog from their online orders. If you go later they're wrapping up.  As for the dishes - I loved everything! I think their biggest success is bringing Filipino and American comfort foods to the next level. The dishes taste like how my relatives make them, but brought up several notches. The Fiesta spaghetti specifically felt like this: tasted like my uncle's famous Filipino spaghetti, but with more finesse and refined flavor. I think they carry this well across all their dishes - regular fried chicken, but super crispy and tangy; classic palabok flavors but with french fries to add a fun crunch; burgers that have simple but unique flavors.  I'm not a huge burger person - so my favorite are the non-burger dishes: The Eugene sandwich and the bloomin onion. The Eugene sandwich is unlike any sandwich I've ever had before! It was salty, tangy, moist, and some sweetness from the onion. I would say this has the perfect bite!  My overall critique is that Pogiboy is delicious and is definitely a must try! Have some patience with long lines and waits - they are a new restaurant trying to figure it all out. But once you taste their dishes you'll realize the long waits are worth it!  Quick shout out to their designer for the EPICCC mascot and really cool assets! Keeps me wanting more from their Instagram handle.",
