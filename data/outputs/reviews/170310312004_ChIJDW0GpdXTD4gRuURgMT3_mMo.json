My coworkers and I always get either vermicelli, bun bo hue, or bun rieu to share. They always make sure to pack the correct number of utensils when I tell them I'm sharing. Today I called to make my usual order of Bun Bo Hue. I mentioned I was sharing with a friend and if they can give me an empty bowl on the side to split the soup. Turns out, they already split my soup for me into two bowls. The food tastes amazing but nothing compared to the hospitality. Highly highly recommend them if you are around here or even visiting.",

I arrived a little over 20 minutes later and upon charging me, the employee at the front said the food would be ready in 5 more minutes. So I waited inside the restaurant but it ended up taking an additional 35 minutes!! The employee never acknowledged the extra time while I was waiting or bothered to give an update that it would be longer than just 5 minutes.  That alone wouldn't have been enough to turn me off forever but the spring rolls (pork and shrimp) were broken open when we got them + the pork was very dry, tough, and hard to eat. There was barely any shrimp in the roll (1.5 per roll) and too much noodles/lettuce filling.  The pho flavor was quite good, but it had too much noodles and barely any meat. Overall, I get why Tank Noodle is more popular than Uptown Pho and would recommend anyone on the fence to stick with Tank.  (Also, this hopefully won't be relevant after 2020 but I ordered during covid times and the employees weren't wearing masks or seemingly taking any additional measures to clean tables after customers left)",

The food is really tasty and very cheap especially the $5.00 Banh Mis which are served with super crispy bread and are very well sized. The pho is great as well as their steamed rice plated and vermicelli dishes too. The service is a tad slow sometimes and there is a lack of seating but only at peak peak eating times. Definitely worth going to.",

Now, the food is about 7/10 for authenticity (I say that as a Vietnamese) however I would not recommend the boba tea it  is a 0/10  the tapioca pearls were hard and tasted horrible. They also had limited flavors for the boba tea.The pho was okay.. about a 5/10 and the b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o was disgusting it's a 3/10 the spring rolls were really good however the sauce was revolting, a 2/10. The sauce was grainy and not smooth at all it was chunky. The service was really slow and they brought each dish out one by one with about a 5 minute interval in between. This made others feel awkward to eat while not everyone had food. Also when we were ordering boba tea the server could not understand what we were saying and had to send in another person so we could order, on top of that when we wanted to order when we could call for a server he would just walk away and ignore us. Regarding the bathroom, it was very small and cramped. It made us very hard to go to the bathroom it was very small and hard to move around. It was also very dirty and untended to. The paper towel dispenser is broken. All together I would not reccomend going here with a big group,  getting boba, or going to the bathroom. It is an ok resteraunt but does not deserve 4.4 stars.",

This was going to be a problem for them at closing time when they could not secure their restaurant at the end of the evening. So they asked if we did this type of work and if we could come out immediately to secure their door. So we agreed to come out and look at the door and give them an estimate secure the door. We arrived and evaluated the situation and spoke with the owners son and told him to board up the door and repair it so it would lock and be secure would be $500.00  The owners son asked if we would accept a check and we were given the green light and then proceeded to do the job we agreed to. After  4 hours of work, that includes clean up we asked for the check after they inspected the door and were happy with the work. The next thing we know the owners sons is trying to pay us half of what we agreed to. We told him this was not good business and if he did not want to pay then would have to get the police involved which we did. We asked the owners to pay us so that we would have to take them to small claims court in front of the Chicago Police and he still wanted to pay us $250.00 and we told him we would see him in court. So to all service people who are called to do any work with the restaurant be prepared to be stiffed. I guess I now understand why he wound up with a front door with the glass busted out of it as I could not understand why someone would want to rob this restaurant unless they had a serious case of the munchies?!! So the end result is we are going to take the company to court and sue them because its not the money but more the principle of it all.",

It's BYOB and there's a liquor store between the El stop and this restaurant. The service was wonderful: our water was always filled, our food came out quickly, and no one pressured us to leave as we lingered around after dinner. My friends had the pho, which they loved. I had the grilled pork chop with sliced pork and sunny side up egg on rice. Delicious! I'm definitely coming back",

Our group of eight was seated immediately, but of course, being farther from the main strip of pho shops means it will be less populated. Stay for the noodle soups, although vegetarians note: there are no veggie-based broths on the menu at present. We ordered spring rolls as an appetizer, and they were delicious. Service was quick, and the surprise note of a sundae was nice. However, this spot, nice as it is, isn't quite as extensive menu-wise or as tasty as some of its competitors down the street. Stil: fresh, hot, and ready to go, especially if you decide on not waiting at more popular places like Tank.",

The menu is not huge, but there are enough options for all. While I was disappointed there was no veggie noodle soup, the noodle dish I ate was good. The spring rolls were fresh, but not amazing. The service was excellent (they asked me if I wanted fish sauce after mentioning my diet), and the ice cream sundae at the end was a good surprise. If I had time to wait, though, I'd go to Tank.",
