We're all sorry that we choose here. The food arrived 40 minutes late, which wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't FREEZING COLD. It didn't help that they didn't wrap the cup that the Esquites was prepared in, and as such the entire bag was a mess of \"corn soup.\" The wrong item that my guest received that she didn't like (a mushroom taco) didn't help the situation either. When I tried to call the restaurant they didn't have anyone available to answer the phone and unfortunately could not resolve it with them either.

Today, I asked for the special, a $9 bowl, written on the board outside. The woman behind the counter said \"OK\" and then went downstairs for 2 minutes. She then went outside to read the board before coming back, apologizing, and offered me a chicken or steak bowl. I asked for chicken. Sour cream is listed as additional cost but not this time, because she offered it to me, I asked if it was additional and she said no. We get the cash register and the total comes to more than $11. She tells me that the special was only for pork. Another time I went, I wanted to see what was in the vegetable burrito (premixed and cooked or made to order?). Man shows me a bucket of squash....OK? I tell him there's all these other things listed here and he says \"yea, we can do that for you\". Why do I have to make a point about what's on the menu to get it included? Other times, the special was listed outside and again: I had to tell them what was on the menu in order to get it? I've had other issues with them charging me the wrong amount for what I ordered. Their menu is unclear and their staff doesn't communicate well. I won't be back.",
