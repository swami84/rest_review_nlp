It was an interesting experience that was just okay in my book.  Got the combination plate that featured the two Quesatacos and Vampiro with a side of Consume. The flavor of the Birria was very good, but somehow everything seemed to greasy and honestly the presentation wasn't all that with very minimal toppings of onions and cilantro that made it seem like they didn't even try dress the order.  I got a Horchata to drink, but was very irritated when they immediately made it and then asked me after the fact if I wanted to drink it then and there before my order which didn't get completed for another 15 minutes or so.  I get it that some people like to drink their drinks while they wait, but don't make it and then ask. It got watered down with the ice melting because of my wait.  Despite my complaining, it really isn't the place you should judge them on their service as it was only takeout at the time I went there due to COVID-19 business restrictions. I would like to go back, not for their Mexican food, but for their Vietnamese twist using the Birria for their Pho and Bahn Mi. Next time I will make sure to tell them in advance not to make my drink until my order is ready.",

I think it is beef. I wish there was enough of a market for kid/goat meat, which is delicious and hard to find.",
