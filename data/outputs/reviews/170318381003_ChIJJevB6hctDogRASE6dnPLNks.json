The selections with the soup, pre made salads and bowls are usually out by 1pm. I went to get a steak bowl at 1:40 pm and was told that the steak is out for the day, AGAIN.  This is after I saw an employee take 3 servings of the steak and put it aside for herself and walked back into the kitchen.  The manager, who was a women, informed me that she could not open up another bag just for me because the rest would have to be throw out because no one else would come to eat it. Interesting , since the 2 other people in line with me asked for the steak but was told was out. This is a very busy hospital facility and at 1:40 pm they cannot open up another bag of steak?!  I have dietary restrictions.  There is not a lot I can eat there.  A lot of excuses that are presented by the managers do not make sense.  You are given apologizes with no solutions.  9/17/19 4.5 STARS I am now updating my review.  After calling corporate about the same situation above, I can now let you know that they have now plenty of steak.  I called cooperate after 3 times in a row in a 7 day period and the steak was out by 1 pm.  I was told no more supply was being made.  4 guests visitors at RUSH were in line with me who asked for the steak and found out the same disappointing news. NO STEAK!  After calling corporate, the situation was quickly resolved.  NOW, THERE IS STEAK!  The have increased the supply.  So the guests at RUSH that come in for the yummy rice/noodle bowels will not be disappointed when they ask for the steak.  I do have to say that the staff is always very nice and courteous, especially to the regulars, like me.  The bakers, front line sandwich makers, salad re fillers and cashiers do try to make your experience a good one.  Thank you for correcting this issue and making my visit to Au Bon Pain a better one.  11/15/19 Went there at 1:22 pm.  Out of steak again.  Enough said:(",
