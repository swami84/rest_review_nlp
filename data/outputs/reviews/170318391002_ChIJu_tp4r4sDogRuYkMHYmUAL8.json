Market Creations does cater to people looking for a quick semi-healthy meal, and it offers a variety of buffet and made to order options for the professional who is hungry for food that isn't too junky. I've been here for lunch a couple times and for breakfast many.  The breakfast buffet is always consistent, with lots of options (even for those who are veggie or gluten free!), but is more of a cafeteria than a cafe.",

Some items, like the chicken wings and the ginger fish, can be good, but overall, I always leave here feeling like I overpaid. $12.95 per pound is pretty outrageous, yet during the lunch hour rush, you could expect to wait in the line that goes all the way out the door. If you come after 2pm, the price is half off, but even then, I still feel like I'm being gypped. I avoid this most time, and only come when I absolutely have to.  Oh, and when you get the soup, be careful or the soup guy will try to flirt with you.",
