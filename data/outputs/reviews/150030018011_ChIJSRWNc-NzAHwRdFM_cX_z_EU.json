Not only was this clearly a locals favorite hangout (with overstuffed furniture around mini fire pits), the food and drinks were amazing. Our bartender was Chad and he was working his tail off! Every time we were going to ask for something, chad was already on his way to our table with whatever we were going to ask for on his tray and a big smile -- like he knows just how to make sure each person really enjoys their vacation. We can't wait to go back during our next visit to paradise.",
