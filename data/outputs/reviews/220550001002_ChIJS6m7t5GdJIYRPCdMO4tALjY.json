Not really inviting at this time more a feardriven thing. We were asked twice to give reason for muzzle exemption, which should not be the business' business, especially when sitting outside anyways.  I wouldnt say I felt herrased. But an \"inviting\" atmosphere is the exact opposite. Even during our time in China years ago, people were standing up to their core values, instead of overreaching into patrons due to mandate. Very sad what is happening right now with this place. We would not return at this time, hope they get better soon.  Food was pretty much ok, unfortunately they seem to be understocked with beer, could not get a second one.",

Cheesy grits, crispy potatoes, breakfast sausage, bacon, Pico de gallo, and a sunny side up egg with a dash of their dragon sauce. The sauce added a mild heat to the dish. It was good and a nice idea. It looked amazing, but sometimes when a chef wants to make something look fancy they don\u2019t think how the customer might eat it. The sausage patty is cut in half and the bacon was in strips. Normally not a problem but in this massive bowl situation it\u2019s a great presentation but hard to eat. It was difficult to cut them into pieces among all of the other foods. I would\u2019ve loved them chopped so I could mix them in with everything to get a little in each bite. I suppose I could\u2019ve removed the strips and eat them but it doesn\u2019t add to the flavor that way. So I had to remove them and tear them into pieces, a bit messy. Others were looking but I don\u2019t have any shame lol. The sausage was a lot harder to deal with trying to cut them to pieces in the bowl with a spoon. Great idea just not practical. This was also the first brunch I\u2019ve gone to without some type of eggs Benedict. We noticed the snowball and were excited about the unique black berry syrup/flavoring. However it didn\u2019t have much of it, just enough to cover the ice so the flavor was weak and watered down. It had very little sweetness for what is supposed to be a sugary treat. I loved the regular menu offerings and would like to go back for another try. I\u2019ll update this if I do so.",

The food was excellent, the Tabasco bribed chicken was crispy, tangy, and super juicy. And it paired perfectly with a nice and tender okonomiyaki waffle. The loaded fries were delicious, and the mojo pork made me want to start dancing like John Favreau and John Leguizamo from the movie Chef.  Go support local restaurants right now if you can.

We were quickly greeted by our waiter, Josh, with a glass refillable bottle of water. He was very personable and professional. He was also laid back enough to have a conversation about the town itself. He informed us about the area, the night life, specific features of each place (drinks, music, atmosphere). Aside from the stellar service, the food and drinks, based off of a seasonal menu, were out of this world. Every person that we came in contact with that worked there greeted us with a smile. Every item we ordered from our drinks, food, to our dessert was perfect.",
