The experience got off to a bad start when we were asked to wait outside in the 22 F weather for 40 minutes past our reservation time because the reservation ahead of us was running over, and were shooed away when we returned to check in after 20 minutes. I know sometimes customers linger but I think for a 1-table shop, there has to be buffer built in for this, or at least willingness to politely ask the party to wrap things up. The food was just ok. Nothing particularly tasty or interesting, certainly nothing that felt worth the price point. I was expecting more backstory to accompany the dishes, given the way Tanam markets the experience as a storytelling dinner. It was also very uncomfortable to be served in the dining room - there wasn\u2019t sufficient space for the waiters to get around the table so I was constantly having a waiter squeeze up against me to get by. Another let down was when we noticed we\u2019d been charged for the most expensive bottle of wine instead of the mid-range one that we ordered and were served. We had to call back to get the bill sorted out later that night. Overall, interesting idea very poorly executed.",

Coincidentally, a friend was coming in town and wanted to do a tasting menu so it was almost fate that I had just recently read about Tanam.  Tanam is located in Bow Market in Somerville, an eclectic courtyard filled with several little shops, including one that sells chocolate, another that sells pierogies, and then a brewery (Remnant Brewery). It's fitting that Tanam is found in Bow Market because of the uniqueness of the dining experience. Something unique about Bow Market is that they have All Gender bathrooms, which I had never seen before. And I'm not talking about the single room bathrooms, I'm talking about those where you go in and there are several stalls and urinals. Definitely a new experience but I'm sure these will become more normal.  We arrived to Tanam to a white room with white curtains and a single table set for 9. There is a 5:00 PM seating and a 7:30 PM seating so we arrived at 7:30 and were seated at the table. Soon after our fellow diners arrived and we ended up becoming friends throughout the meal. I think that is the point of Tanam...you end up having a conversation with people you wouldn't otherwise have and you make new friends.  FOOD: We were served a 5-course fixed-price meal of Filipino American cuisine. The owner and head chef (Ellie) would come to explain the inspiration for each dish as it was served, whether it be something she learned from someone in her family or something popular in the Philippines. While the Filipino elements were there, she also tried to incorporate local New England elements, especially in the seafood. Normally I would go through every dish in detail but given that the menu will be changing soon and I think it should be more of a surprise, I will refrain (but you can see the pictures below). What I will say that most of the dishes were delicious and executed well and they will all have ingredients you likely have never had before. Some favorite dishes included lobster, duck confit, and this fritter with papaya, bean sprouts, and scallions.  DRINKS: The drinks are very unique here as well...I had a Filipino beer (San Miguel) but my friend had a purple cocktail made with Ube. They take a lot of pride in their drink menu so be sure to try a few things.  This is a very unique experience that you won't find anywhere else. I would highly recommend it as a way to get out of your comfort zone and have a dining experience different from the usual small plates restaurants around the city (which I also love).",

Before I get into the Kamayan, I will warn you that this restaurant is SMALL. It can't be more than 100 square feet. They don't have a bathroom, but there is one available nearby. You have the option to eat outside in a cute little courtyard though if you aren't doing the Kamayan. The Kamayan is a Filipino family style feast where you sit around a table laid with banana tree leaves under a variety of foods and eat with your hands! Tanam hosts these every Wednesday at 5pm, 7pm and 9pm. There are 10 seats, and they will sell all 10 even if you have a party of 8 (like us). It's not awkward though, since it's pretty fun for everyone and easy to get along. It's house policy for everyone to wash their hands before sitting. For the feast, the staff will artfully lay out rice in a snake pattern, with 4 lobsters, fish, fried pork belly, fried chicken wings, muscles, green veggies, pineapple, sauces and more. Before the feast begins, the staff will teach you how to eat with your hands, which is unexpectedly difficult when trying to dip rice clumps in sauce. Then, you gorge yourself for 2 hours until you're in a sweet and salty food coma. They have a small drink selection, but wow they have some really refreshing unique cocktails. Get the ube sour at least. The biggest downside of the Kamayan is how expensive it is. The seats are $70 each, and go to $89 if you include tax and tip. This doesn't include drinks, which are pricey. It's a lot of food, and it tastes good, but it of course isn't as efficient as hitting up a cheap Chinese buffet for food per dollar spent. However, it's a lot more social than a buffet or any other kind of \"all you can eat\" place, so it's hard to put a price on that. Probably not $89 though. Still, I don't have any regrets reserving the seats. It was a good, fun experience that everyone was happy with. We were the second group to finish the entire feast (mostly because of my personal efforts to make it so), and I was completely stuffed and happy. It was definitely a memorable experience in a good way, and I recommend everyone to try it at least once.",

Actually, I take that back. I will not recount in detail, I will only quickly summarize. We spent $60 and got a little bit of pork snout and hoof and some glue like rice, a ramen noodle and glass noodle dish that looks less interesting than a microwavable package you could buy at Hmart, and a tiny cocktail that tastes delicious but was gone in two sips.

They were all elegantly plated.  One of the dishes was lobster lumpia. The contrast between the crispiness of the wrapper and the lobster filling was so good I could have eaten at least 4 of them. The menu is called PULU. I understand that she has 4 or 5 menus that she rotates. This one is  awesome.  I can hardly wait to taste her Holiday Menus.

        "caption": "To start, I applaud the owners for opening a Filipinx food joint in a town that feels like a Filipinx food desert.  Despite a ton of hype, the experience at Tanam was disappointing.  This review is based on Tanam's bar menu on Thursday nights.  --Service-- Because of the space limitations, the joint feels cramped with a single, long, hightop table inside. There was one couple ordering in front of us, and it appeared that the co-owner/bartender/POS staffer was doing too many things at once. We waited for 5 mins in line after the other couple, before arriving at the counter, when the staffer asked us to wait a few more mins while she wrapped up her current orders of food & drink.  For 2 people, we ordered 3 items off the bar menu and 2 drinks -- the Sisig ($11) with Plain Rice ($3), Ginger Garlic wings ($8), Canton Pancit ($12), Lamb Talk cocktail ($14), and the Ube Sour cocktail ($14) -- for a staggering $66. The staffer asked us to grab a table outside, and she would bring out the food when it was ready.  We headed outside, picking a spot a few tables away, in the middle of the courtyard, eagerly awaiting our food. But we kept waiting. And waiting. And waiting.  30 mins in, we were really hungry, with no water, no drinks, nothing. I headed into the shop to check in on the drinks, wondering if those could come out first, to be met with the question, \"where are you guys sitting?\" I pointed outside, to the table smack in the middle of everything, and the staffer said, \"you'll need to sit on our patio so we can serve you the drinks.\" Fine, fair enough. We pick a table that was not occupied by one of the larger parties.  10 mins later, the staffer comes out, and kindly asks us to move to the \"Tanam patio\" because that's where they can serve us with their liquor license, and that they are counter service so they can't keep an eye out beyond the \"Tanam patio.\" Again, totally fair. However, I had to point out that a few things would have really helped at the get go: 1) When the staffer asked us to grab a table outside, it would have really helped to specify which tables were \"Tanam patio\" tables and which were not. There's no demarcation of the cafe tables outside, they all look the same throughout the courtyard, and there are no walls or lines, so there's literally no way to understand where this imaginary line begins and ends. 2) Mark the tables with literally anything identifiable. Direct diners there.  At this point, it had been 40 mins since we ordered, and we still had not received any food, any water, or any drinks.  Upon relocating the 2nd time, the staffer brought out our two drinks. 5 mins later, another staffer, probably the other co-owner, brought out our 3 entrees. Soon after another staffer kindly brought out water glasses and water, and some compostable sporks, spoons, and napkins.  Abbreviated Food Review due to character limits - Sisig ($11) with Plain Rice ($3)  Portions: In a round aluminum tin, the rice was barely half filled and less than half of the plate. The sisig portion also felt small for an $11 counter service dish. This plate alone would not have been enough even for lunch.  Flavor: The sisig tasted one-dimensional & dull. There was some pork liver, chopped pig ears, some other pulled pork type lean meat, and some pieces of chopped onion. There's no caramelization you'd expect from a sizzling hot plate of sisig, and no flavor development beyond the minerality of the liver and the bland flavor of the pork meat.  - Ginger Garlic wings ($8)  We ordered the Ginger Garlic wings, but instead received the Bicolano wings instead. The coconut milk came through the sauce with the slightest hint of heat from the bird chilies, but the wings themselves tasted dry and tired.  - Canton Pancit ($12)  The menu described the pancit as stir fried egg noodles. It was a MIX of yellow-instant ramen-tasting egg noodles and blobs of rice noodles with uneven saucing. There were probably 10 strands of yellow egg noodles mixed in what was mostly rice noodles.",

        "caption": "This is a difficult review, since I generally root for daring small businesses just like this fledgling Filipino restaurant. After seeing some hype from Eater Boston, I was excited to try Tan\u00e1m's Kamayan dinner this Wednesday night, but the experience was unfortunately more novelty than gourmet.  At $70 (pre-tax & tip) per person for the Kamayan option, the food was of uneven and generally disappointing quality. While I understand the chill temperature of the food due to limitation of the Kamayan style (where 19+ dishes are served en masse on the surface of a large table where the guests eat with their hands), some of the protein (pork belly and chicken skewer) were overcooked; the veal spring rolls were dry; the Kabocha squash puree and grilled egg-plant were a bit under-seasoned.  Some saving graces: The lobster was delicious. There was a good balance of acidity, sweetness, and savoriness from various fruits and (made-in-house?) condiments. The cocktails were innovative, and utilized unusual Filipino ingredients. It was a lot of fun to get my hands dirty and commune with other guests, and very educational to learn the various unique aspects of Filipino cuisine.  Although the food at Tan\u00e1m is mostly competently executed, none of it has the wow factor that makes me go \"That's amazing!\", leaving much to be desired for dinner at such a high price point. While the \"narrative\" aspect of the cuisine certainly adds to the experience, the ultimate value of a restaurant should be judged on the deliciousness of its food, upon which Tan\u00e1m has much room to improve.  EDIT: Chef Ellie got in touch with me and offered me an unconditional refund. I voluntarily changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars, based on her demonstrated eagerness to improve and give the best experience for her customers.",

It felt almost magical, and the setting was elegant, but the staff made it feel homey and not stuffy at all-- we felt very welcome and comfortable.  The food was spectacular, and you learned about the inspiration or heritage for each dish.  The tamarind and daikon chawanmushi in particular blew me away, but the craft and care put in was evident in each course.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.",
