The food was fantastic - the burrata, mushroom gnocchi and N'Duja pizza were my favorite - and the staff was very attentive and gracious. Already planning future visits to make our way through the rest of the menu.",

I am referring to clients, of course. Otherwise, while the baguette was overpriced at $5.50, they have some excellent cold cuts for very good prices; Sicilian oregano for $3/bag, Frantoia EVOO for $19, a fancy rice  in a metal tin for $10/kg, and many other pantry items that are not an arm and a leg. Go, browse and find many affordable goodies. It would be great if prices WERE LISTED, but I understand they just opened. Give this place a try.",

Turns out it was SEVEN DOLLARS and sixty-three cents for a small slice of pepperoni pizza to go. I was so surprised I didn\u2019t say anything, but now I wish I had said no thanks. The slice was good, but GREAT slices are available nearby at Rome to Brooklyn and Williamsburg Pizza for half or less that price. There\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t list the prices for any items at the counter...",
