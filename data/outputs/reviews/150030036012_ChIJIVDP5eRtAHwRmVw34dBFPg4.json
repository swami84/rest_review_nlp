The menu was a little trimmed and the self-serve wine tasting area was closed, but many of our favorites remained on the menu and with our wine card, we still got to taste their many wonderful wines ordered from and delivered by the server.  The service is always so friendly and helpful and the food delicious, inventive and beautifully presented.  The atmosphere is sophisticated and interesting, being part of a furniture store.  The normal seating layout was already compliant with proper distancing, the ceiling is ~30ft high, so plenty of air volume, and the staff is all tastefully masked, so it feels very low risk at the same time as pretty much normal.  It was a lovely evening - highly recommend you go now!",

Superb service, attentive but unintrusive servers, who were knowledgeable about the menu.  Stimulating art filled environment.  The not so good - we sat in what can be described as a booth, with wooden bench seats with pillows that proved to be uncomfortable as the dinner went on.  The tables was a little too high as well.

Mel did a fabulous job in explaining every dish and every item and she was extremely attentive.  The manager (I believe his name was Michael) was just as amazing.  He too was very attentive and even made recommendations on our desserts.  He even presented a dessert to us that was unique, different and just down right delicious.

The service was really good, my water glass was never empty. Employees were very friendly. I ordered the pork banh mi sandwich. It was super tasty-- though the \"papaya salad\" on the side was more of a carrot slaw. The hamachi was a nice appetizer to share- super fresh fish. I want to go back to try the misoyaki salmon!",
