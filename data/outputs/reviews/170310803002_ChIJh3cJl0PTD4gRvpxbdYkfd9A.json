Couldn't look at the specials for delivery or pickup because selecting each option just led to an error that neither worked or was allowed. On top of that, I couldn't order online at all without some random third party who of course takes a premium. We ended up calling in and getting a % off of our order. The gal was really nice and friendly and we didn't have to wait very long, but by the time we were able to order I was already pulled up outside and probably should have just gone inside to order.",

She also buy things from places like walmart, target, furniture stores ect.... she sell some of the merchandise for profit and she keeps some because she have a lot of kids. I know this personally, she sales merchandise through inbox\u2019s and dm\u2019s. I\u2019ve reported her to corporate and told them to start an investigation.

We ended up throwing the pizza and eating the cheesesticks. Never ordering Papa Johns in Chicago again.  The guy who works there promised that my next order would be delivered fresh or whatever but Im good on that. The pizza came 3 hrs later and NOT only that the guy who works there blamed it on the weather. If yall were doing business right like the other pizza places then you wouldnt be accepting orders because of the weather but instead you decided to take my 40$ and deliver 3 hrs late and blame it on the weather when my apartment building is 5 mins away.",

I know, I know - a Chicago sports blog ordering pizza from papa johns should be outlawed, but we had just got off the boat and were starving. We thought \"Deep dish is going to take too long, let's just get papa johns because it will be quick\" We were WAY off. After waiting two hours we tried tracking my pizza - that was broken. Then we tried calling. A clown answered and then told us our pizza was on the way. 30 minutes later, I called back. Another idiot picked up. He said it was out for delivery and should be there by the time we got off the phone. At this point, we were dying of starvation, so when another 30 minutes passed, we were about to go to this papa johns and make the pizza ourselves. But, we were so weak from starvation we decided to call again. The manager finally got on the phone and said the pizza was STILL THERE!!! He apologized, told us this was refund but that he would \"make sure\" the driver right next to him would bring us our pizza. I accepted his apology and gesture. Stuff happens you know? When another hour passed, we felt a fury that hasn't been felt in years. We called again and the manager said he couldn't get in touch with his own driver. I repeat...the manager doesn't know how to get a hold of his employees. We told him to forget it and we would make our own food - 3.5 hours later. He insisted they were making our order again and sending it. SO, while in the bathroom, we got a call that the pizza was downstairs. When we saw the call we went down to the lobby - I tracked the time - it was 3 to 4 minutes since they had called. I got to the lobby and the driver had already left. AND THEY TOOK OUR PIZZAS WITH THEM!! I called the manager back and he said it was policy not to leave food with the doorman, when I explained that this was unacceptable. He hung up the phone. This not only was terrible customer service - we were literally weak from starvation. CALLING ALL PEOPLE OF CHICAGO - NEVER ORDER PIZZA HERE!",

Well, 30 minutes have passed and the online status shows that the pizzas STILL have not even gone into the oven!  I've called the store twice, and both times I was placed on hold for over 5 minutes with no pickup.  Who knows when (if?) this will ever show up.  I suspect the staff is overwhelmed, but this seems to be a pattern... whoever manages this location needs to get more staff in place!",

The guy on the phone said our pizza was out for delivery. About 20-30 minutes later my phone rong but I couldn't get to the phone fast enough. But I immediately called back no one answered. I called Pape John's again this time they stated that they called but no one answered. I told him I missed the delivery guys phone call but I called him right back but no one  answered. I then asked him why didn't the delivery guy come  into the store since this is a business the food was being delivered to and the first delivery guy came in, no answer was given. I'm assuming  this was same delivery guy who delivered the pizza the first pizza he was very impatient and rude when he came in. I then asked for a refund since it has been over two and half hours since we order our first pizza. I paid with debit with I know doesn't take long to be refunded like a credit card. So I call three days later being that I haven't received my refund. I was told to give them two business days. It has been two business and I have not received my refund for my pizza.",
