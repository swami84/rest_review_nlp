It wasn't very crowded on Friday at 8pm which was surprising considering the food was incredible. The filet and pork chop were our favorites. The sauce with both was so good. Location is perfect walking distance to Bourbon or Frenchman st to go out after dinner. It is white table cloth and we spent about 50$ a person including 2 bottles of wine for 8 people. Oh and the chocolate cake was incredible and definitely shareable.",

The bar and music are awesome; this would be a great place to even stop in and grab a drink, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not eat too. The food menu is short but sweet. The turtle soup, crab cakes, & oysters are great. The BBQ Shrimp is fantastic, and makes a very good shared appetizer for the table. I've also ordered the Trout Eugene and Court bouillon, which were both phenomenal.",

With a party of 7, when our food came they gathered enough servers to deliver all our plates at exactly the same time. Bottomless Mimosas were immediately refilled if they were 1/2 empty. Today's special Country gumbo was overloaded with seafood... Turtle soup was also very good. 2 different Omelettes ordered, both wonderful, as was the shrimp and grits and eggs Benedict. Too full for desert, so instead had a yummy chocolate martini made with pecan vodka! Birthday boy got a complementary bread pudding with ice cream topped with run caramel and chocolate It's our favorite and happy to share with our friends!",

Sean has been there since 1899 \ud83d\ude09 his hospitality and history of the restaurant is outstanding. First course, Crab cakes absolutely delicious and one of the best we have ever had! Second course, hubby had the chicken and sausage gumbo was very yummy and I enjoyed the corn and crab bisque...Omgoodness! Third course, we ordered the Blackened Red fish and the Trout Eugene both were fantastic and perfectly prepared. For Dessert we ordered the Banana pudding parfait creamy and delicious with layers of banana cake and candy pecans that added a delicious crunch. Thank you for a wonderful evening we will definitely be back for another delicious dinner.",

There were 4 other tables on the balcony, 3 of them in the shade of umbrellas and one other one like ours for 2, in the sun.  We asked if we could be seated at one of the tables in the shade and were told no because those were reserved for 4 tops.  Another couple arrived and they were seated at the other table in the sun and they also asked the hostess if they could be seated at a table in the shade.  This time, the answer was, \u201cwell, we usually reserve those for 4 people seatings but I can go check and see if we can move you there.\u201d  I said, \u201cwait a minute, we already tried that also and you said no\u201d.  The couple remained at their assigned table, but just like us, became very hot, quickly.  I asked if we could be moved to a table indoors and the hostess said she would check.  After a while, she came back and said that all other tables were reserved and there was no other place to seat us.  The only other party that was ever seated on the balcony while we were there, was a party of 3.  During the meal, I moved my chair a couple of feet away from our table, into the shade of one of the umbrellas because I was starting to burn.  The manager (named Scott) came over and said to me, \u201cMa\u2019am you are going to have to move your chair back to your table\u201d.  I said, \u201cOh is someone arriving for the table next to us now?\u201d  He said, \u201cYes\u201d.  So, I moved my chair forward again to our table, back in the sun.  No one ever came for that table.  Ten minutes went by.  It was offensive and so unkind of him to do that to me.  Totally unnecessary and downright mean.  We finished our starter and our cocktails and decided to leave.  We spent 30 minutes in the full, hot sun for no reason whatsoever.  The water tasted like dish soap.  The food that we did have was mediocre.  The manager, Scott, was a jerk.  Enough said.",

Did some research before heading down to NOLA and with the great reviews and hearing there was a live band, decided to book a reservation at Sbisa. As soon as you step in, you feel the atmosphere here. The staff were very attentive, professional, and on point. Absolutely no hiccups with their service. The food.... It was excellent! Ordered the catch of the day and added the BBQ shrimp to the place. The shrimp was probably the most flavourful shrimp I have ever had in my life, no joke! The fish was cooked very well too but the shrimp was certainly a game changer. We enjoyed each other's company, paired with great wine, live music, and food. The dinner really set us up right for a night out in the Big Easy. Thank you, Cafe Sbisa staff!",

We considered the mainstay restaurants like Brenans or Arnaud's but settled in Sbisa.  Located near the French Market it is far from the bustle of Bourbon St.    It does not look like much from the outside but was elegant and comfy inside. Service was wonderful from the moment we entered.  Only glitch was our server did not bring bread which the Maitre d' caught and corrected.  The food was excellent.   We enjoyed each dish for our 3 course meal. Price was reasonable for the quality and taste of the food although not cheap.  We were also entertained by three wonderful musicians who played a mix of RnB and classic Jazz.  We met them outside and they were total gentlemen.    Overall Sbisa is a great dining option if you don't mind getting off Bourbon St.",

The establishment was amenable when it came to the reservation and accommodating with our seating for service. When we arrived, we were seated and everything was awaiting us. Our party was the largest there and the restaurant wasn\u2019t busy even while we enjoyed our meal. One of our members ordered the steak and eggs medium rare. She repeated the order to the server twice which repeated it back to her. However when her order was brought out, it came out medium well and she was able to tell when she cut into it. She sent the item back so her steak could be cooked properly. She was approached by the manager at the time, Scott Stage who pulled her to the side and stated that she could not receive another steak and then proceeded to tell her that she told the server the incorrect order and she, the customer was responsible for the cost of the steak. The member alerted me of the situation and I went to speak to Mr. Stage who\u2019s demeanor gave off the impression of poor customer service and management. He stated that they are not a \u201ccorporate\u201d restaurant like others and orders cannot be replaced. I then stated that one other member had ordered crab cakes that were too salty and they were replaced promptly, how was that situation any different? I explained to him that clearly a mistake was made and a customer shouldn\u2019t have to pay for a meal they didn\u2019t get to eat. He also stated that the Executive Chef Who is the owner would be telling me the same thing if he were here. That she would Have to pay for the meal regardless whether it was correct or not. He then had the server give her account of the situation with the member there and when I addressed him and told him that she will not pay for a meal she didn\u2019t enjoy, he said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cargue about that and to go ahead and give her another steak and get them the check so they can get out of here.\u201d He then walked away. His attitude was deplorable and so is his work ethic. I nor the 20 other ladies that are apart of our brunch group will patron there ever again. I\u2019ve been to finer establishments than this and have been to everyday establishments and have never been treated as I was today. Our 1100 bill was paid in full (including the steak my member never received) which includes the 20% gratuity. You would think you\u2019d get better service for that kind of patronage.",

Ordered lamb chops asked for them well done waiter said they would be too dry well done and guaranteed no blood if medium well they were slimy and bloody and had to be returned but were ok after being returned .
