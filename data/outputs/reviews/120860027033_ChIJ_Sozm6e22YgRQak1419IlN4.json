Today they get my order wrong, and when calling the store I have never been so rudely spoken too when alerting them about the situation.  The employee even hung on me saying she was too busy.  I guess my $700 I've given them since moving here really isn't that important to them, so they are not important to me and I will never order from this Subway again.  Plenty of other stores out there in downtown Miami.  What a joke.  Store management:  You need to leash your employees attitudes as it does cost you money.",

There's even a person inside behind the counter in plain sight on her cell phone refusing to open the door, waving at us as if to indicate \"yes, I'm here, I'm just not interested in working right now. Amazing typical Miami attention to service. At least the owners name & phone number are on the door. Called & left a message. Smart money bets they won't do anything about it though.

The approach to the subway should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect inside. The inside is just as shabby is the outside. People of questionable character hang around the store during the day. I shudder to think about the kinds of people that hang around once it's dark.  The inside of the store is filthy. The floor is dirty with streak marks all over it. Even though when I was there someone was cleaning the floor, it was clear to me that this place needs a deep rub down to get the grime out. The tables are unclean also.  The girls at work the counter are fine and made a reasonable sandwich but for some reason none of the ingredients felt fresh. It closer look at the lettuce showed me dark spots that arise when the lettuce has been sitting around for too long. Maybe they are you reusing lettuce between days and the same for other vegetables.  This is definitely not a place I would recommend unless you really have to go for some Subway.",

They only had one kind of cookie & only 2 kinds of bread (white or wheat) BOTH WERE STALE! The fixings for the sandwiches hadn't been restocked which slowed down the new staff more. And when I was finally at the register they told me \"No card only cash\", argued with each other in Spanish why no one told me. They then made the announcement to the store. The cashier asked the manager what to do with my sandwich. The manager shrugged her shoulders and laughed & told her to throw it away.

She's basically been giving the customers a hard time including me. Never had I'd written a bad review before, but this time, I felt like I had to. Had a terrible experience at this Subway, and never had I'd seen a customer service so despicable due to the fact that this employee in particular is a miserable individual and takes her personal misery out on the customers.
