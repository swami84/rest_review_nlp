I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting a gallon of pasta as if we were at the Olive Garden, but I\u2019m astonished at the audacity of charging someone $19 for half a small container\u2019s worth of cacio e pepe. Or $10 for a tiny container of tiramisu. After spending over $80 for tonight\u2019s celebratory dinner, my boyfriend and I still had to make more food at home because the two pastas we got were only barely enough food for him, let alone both of us, which is saying something since we tend to eat small portions anyway. I can\u2019t fault them for the taste of the food, the two bites in the box were good. But to be honest, we have had comparable food but at a much better value from other Italian focused restaurants in the city. I would not return, but if price isn\u2019t a factor for you then definitely check it out.",

Instead, I was met with attitude. When I told them that I attempted to use the app but it was unresponsive, the person on the end said my internet connection must not have been strong enough to complete the order, which is both untrue and unacceptable. I was denied the opportunity to place an order. I\u2019m a frequent customer at Red Hen and typically have positive experiences there, but today the staff was rude and very difficult to deal with.

And the service was a bit odd.  I snagged a reservation by chance. We decided to start with some drinks. I got the Suit and Tie and my boyfriend got another drink with coffee in it. My drink was basically all alcohol with little to no other flavor in it, which was...interesting. I didn\u2019t even finish it.  We ordered the chicken liver mousse toast which was actually quite good. The spaghetti squash appetizer was also pretty tasty.  For our meals, we ordered the cacio y pepe and the seafood linguini. The cacio was solid and the seafood linguini was also tasty.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and subbed out the mint gelato for the cherry gelato. Easily the best part of the meal.  The reason I\u2019m docking some stars off is because 1) I felt this place was overpriced for food that was good but not amazing and 2) our server seemed super passive aggressive and there was something totally off-putting about the way they spoke to us. Here\u2019s an example: When the server offered to take away our small plates after the squash, I tried to help and put my silverware on top of the plate. They then took my plate, looked extremely upset, sat it BACK down, rearranged the silverware and picked it back up.  Our server didn\u2019t have any suggestions on the menu either, which was odd because we were clearly not sure what to order from the antipasti section. They walked by our table a bunch and didn\u2019t ask how the meal was going. Just seemed like they really wanted to rush us out of there.  Not sure I\u2019d come back anytime soon but am glad I gave it a try.",

The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu and wines. I live down the street and sometimes will pop in on a weekday to just get one of their pastas.  The rigatoni, as is known, is the best dish. And the chicken liver fig spread. And trout roulettes. Amazing all around.",

We waited by the bar for approximately 45 minutes prior to be seated at a table. While waiting we had som delicious cocktails. Once seated we tried the delicious food. We had two of the small plates, two appetizers and then one pasta and one main dish. We had the ricotta crostini, chicken liver, burrata with grilled zucchini and the charred octopus. All of these plates were deliciously well prepared. Hard to find a favorite one. Then we had the mezze rigatoni and the porchetta. While both were great, the rigatoni won by a good advantage. The porchetta could have been a bit crispier, and less cooked inside as it was a bit tough. This said, was one of the best porchetta and definitely better than if I had cooked. A place to try again.",

One of the better dining experiences I've had in a while with regards to the customer service. My party was waiting a little longer than expected because of how busy the restaurant was and without any prompting our server offered us free desert! Elegant and modern but with a rustic feel. The food is reasonably priced for it's quality and the deserts are to die for. I had an interesting cultural realization while I was dining however. I and the rest of my party, were the only African-American's in the restaurant other than members of the service staff. This was particularly strange because of the historically African-American neighborhood that the restaurant is in. The space definitely gives an intense feeling of how the neighborhood space is gentrifying and the juxtaposition of the clientele with the neighborhood right outside of it's window, was an experience that I was completely unable to ignore.",

We arrived at 5 pm when they opened because we couldn't get a reservation at a decent time so we ate at the bar. We were greeted within minutes and served our drinks promptly. Having been here before, I knew I wanted the Burrata (a creamy, firm cheese dish similar to mozzarella). We also started with the smoked salmon with the creamy horseradish. To say delicious would be an understatement. We followed up with the rockfish with creamy polenta and the wood grilled chicken with kale and potatoes. Needless to say, I left full but not overly stuffed and happy with the service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because this place is relatively small, so we couldn't get a reservation until 9:30 pm which is too late for me. Although eating at the bar was fine, towards the end we had hoverers (people that stand behind you and make you want to hurry up and pay your bill so they can have your seat). Otherwise, I had a great time.",

Wanted an appasimento or ripasso, didn't recognize anything on the menu. Server said \"You should talk to Sebastian\". Sebastian, one of the owners, recommended Negroamora, \"at $45, a steal\". HE WAS SO RIGHT. Wife wanted to split a salad, no problem switching the dressing, salad was awesome. Her pasta: Rabbit sugo with vegetables. Mine: Rigatoni with anis and sausage. Both plates well sized (neither nouvelle cuisine small nor American diner huge). I love rich food, I barely finished mine. Dessert. Well. Torn, I took the first one, figured I'd be linear and take the second next time. Toasted almond and bitter chocolate tart with homemade mint ice cream. Absolutely incredible flavour pairings. Service: Excellent. Atmosphere: Excellent. Food: Excellent. Wine: Excellent. All in, $110, not bad at all for what we had.",
