The waitress very friendly listened to our problem then talked to the gentleman in other language . Then she told us sorry about the problem but their sushi is fresh, and gave us a coupon . So shame ! We returned the coupon to the girl. Then the gentleman talked to the waitress with bad attitude in other language. The atmosphere was just so terrible in that moment.
