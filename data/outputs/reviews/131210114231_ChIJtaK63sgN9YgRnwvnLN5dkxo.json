Also, Jenny father chili is exceptional not anywhere near sweet! Where are your taste buds? I have never had a cold cookie or bread that was cold. How can they be when their in basket on the counter.

Luckily, I am a short bike ride away from Jenny and her INCREDIBLE staff. Their food is made fresh and the menu is different every single day! In addition to the delicious hot soups and creative salads, being able to stop by for a couple quarts of soup from their refrigerator has been a godsend. They always have several vegan options no matter what. Their bread - from Alon's bakery - is world class & vegan as well. You can learn a lot about cooking healthy/hearty/delicious food from Jenny and her staff. Jenny even sells her cook books at the restaurant. On top of it all, Jenny is a generous philanthropist and has her own organizations dedicated to feeding our neighbors who are food insecure. So, do yourself a favor and stop by for a lunch combo or a quart (or 3) of soup. You will be glad you experienced the power of Souper Jenny. P.s. Shout out to Jamiesha! Thank you for being so kind and for always taking such great care of me <3",

I am giving it 3 stars because I felt uncomfortable with the fact that when I paid for my food with a credit card, 10% tip was automatically selected, and my understanding as a first time customer was that it was self serve once you pick up your order at the counter. The order was already $24 for two people soup and salads. Indeed, I bused my own plates - into individual bins and trash.  I let the tip go because it was awkward to change it when on the spot. I'd also recommend to Jenny to put some sliders or something on the bottom of the chair legs as the scraping of old wooden chairs on the concrete floor any time someone slid out a chair was awful. Otherwise, a nice decor and fun atmosphere.",
