My boyfriend and I walked in on a Wednesday night and the place was empty save 2-3 other people. I asked the bartender for a menu and he proceeded to treat me like a child and spoke to me in the most condescending tone. The sangria I had was the worst I've ever had (\"tropical paradise\" - apparently rum, cheap white wine, a cherry and a bit of diced pineapple). My boyfriend's Old fashioned was admittedly better. Art and ambience is fine. I was so put off by how the bartender treated me - and only me, as he was fine with the other customers, that I could not eat there. We had one drink each and left. I was extremely disappointed and it seems poor customer service is a running theme here. I will not be back.",

I was confused how a blueberry lemon thyme sangria could have four bits of apple in it. After tasting it, it did not taste like blueberry, lemon or thyme. Our server came over to ask us how it tasted. I questioned if it was the right drink and she said it was. I then told her I couldn't taste the flavors in which she responded maybe it's you.  Tiramisu was not great. Hard ladyfingers and bland filling to dip them in.  Three stars for the crab cakes. Probably won't be back.",

Most had little taste and every single one, regardless of flavor, had diced apples floating on top but no other fruit that you'd expect in Sangria. Even the cherry chocolate flavor had apples floating on top. I will have to say that the food tasted fantastic. Just be aware that you're getting small plates even though you're paying for full portions and the sangria is way over priced for the quality.",

Waitress was SUPER rude - she said \"so are you going to order something from the menu or not?\".  The sangria was okay but in the smallest wine glass. You can drink way better sangria at your local Bonefish Grill.  The bar owner should've had a soft opening with people who would actually critique.",
