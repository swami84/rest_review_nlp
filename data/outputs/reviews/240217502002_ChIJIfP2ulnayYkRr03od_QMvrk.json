The food is pretty good and you get a decent portion. I have only been here once and while it was ok, our server was not that good. We asked for a beer refill before our food was brought out to the table. She seemed happy to do for us and walked off. She was gone for about 20 minutes and brought us our food, but not the refills. A friend in our party said \u201cthank you. And the beers?\u201d Our waitress pursed her lips and looked irritated and said \u201cand the beers\u201d and walked off to, we assumed, get out drinks. We watched as she walked about to other tables, placed orders, went to the bar, got her phone out, talked to another server, answered the phone, sat another group of people, went back to talking to the other waiter, checked on another table and then FINALLY poured our beers and brought them to us. I will just say, they did have people in the place, but it was not crazy busy\u2026. Anyway, when we were close to finishing our meals, we asked for the check, which was brought out to us. However, when our waitress collected the payment, the same thing happened. She placed the black checkbook on the counter that STILL contained our credit card, and proceeded to help other people and check on other tables. Our check and payment was left sitting for about 15 minutes. A friend in the party finally got up and went to the bar and asked for the bill to be paid because we had to leave for a show at the Weinberg Center that started fairly soon. The food was good, but I do not think it was enough to entice me in going back and possibly experiencing the same service.",

I personally love their vast selection of different stir fries, I can't even name a favorite, they've all been so good. I most recently had the Polynesian stir fry with grilled salmon and it was SO good!! Good portions, too, I always leave satisfied.  Oh yeah, and if you're just on a walk in downtown frederick, pop in for an apple cider to go. It's next level delicious, perfect thing to chase away the cold.",

The fun colours and variety of art and music give the Orchard a fun, eclectic vibe. I also found a stir fry bowl to be more than enough as a main course (I brought home leftovers!) when ordering an appetizing, and would probably have had almost half of something from the entree category left if I had an appetizer before. The Orchard Restaurant is definitely on my list of places to return to. Edit to add: I do want to mention that you shouldn't go in expecting authentic cuisine from any of the cultures represented on the menu; I would call the dishes more inspired by those cultures and their flavours.",

Southern cajun, asian teriyaki, whatever you're in the mood for they probably have it. It's a great place for families or parties of varied tastes. There are many vegitarian or vegan choices;  many menu items start out vegitarian and your can add a protein of your choice. The kids menu is perfect, simple but good entree items with fruit and a salad. The atmosphere is cozy and much quieter than most other downtown restaurants.  Add in a good selection of beer, wine, and drink specials and you've got a fantastic night out.",

They've always helped me at the door, made sure my ESA dog had water, and made extra certain that our food had nothing in it that I couldn't eat.  It's nice and quiet inside and the decorations encourage you to talk with people instead of staring at screens.  You can't beat chilling at the tables in front and watching the sights of downtown; can't beat their location.  Thanks guys!",

We went for he first time on pride day this past weekend so I understand that it was a little busy. The Japanese stir fry was very bland and so was the fried zucchini. My husband didn\u2019t like his stir fry either. It\u2019s like nothing had flavor and It was mostly veggies too. However, I\u2019m mostly writing my first review ever because a staff member by the name of Jeff tried to take a toy away from my son. He should have asked one of us to take care of it. (Which we did try to but kids will be kids). Anyway, It freaked us out that a total stranger did that because he wasn\u2019t even our waiter. Our waitress by the way, was very sweet though.

So finding a restaurant that serves multiple vegan options for me to choose from, and which are labeled as such, is a dream come true! Then when the food is delicious, the wine mellow, and the service attentive and friendly without hovering, I am delighted!  We started with a bottle of Gouguenheim Malbec (which was excellent) and we each had a side salad composed of romaine, shaved carrots, shredded purple cabbage, red onion slices and alfalfa sprouts. I ordered the only vegan dressing: sesame vinaigrette which was delicious. My husband had the tomato tamari, also delicious.  For our meal we each ordered a stir fry: my husband safely ordered the Szechuan with tofu which was good, but my meal stood out: a Creole stirfry, veggies only. It tasted just like jambalaya and has inspired me to try making this dish at home! Both stir fries were over organic brown rice which was cooked perfectly: not too crunchy, not too sticky.  I am really looking forward to returning...I almost ordered the Mediterranean stir fry, or I may order a vegan entree (imagine that!) I can't wait!",

Food is wholesome, natural and tasty.  Of particular high quality are all the soups and home made dressings offered.  Good choices for everyone including vegetarian.  Have to say the beer is always cold and dark beer selections are always good.",

Fast, friendly, and professional service, too. I'm not a big fan of the decor\u2014it's rather on the grandma side for my tastes\u2014but everything else is perfect.

        "caption": "Hubby and I came in for dinner on Saturday night. This was the first time we've ever been to downtown Frederick for dinner. Parking was kind of a pain. We drove around for a good 20 minute looking for a spot, getting rejected from the closest parking garage--the \"full\" light clicked on right as we pressed the button for our ticket. We finally found another garage a couple blocks further and it only cost $1 to park which was a pleasant surprise.  Neither of us eat red meat or pork and it was really satisfying to go into a restaurant and have the option of ordering anything on the menu. We sat in the front room and it is pretty small, but once we were seated I was comfortable and my worry about being seated next to the bar was completely negated. The staffers are mostly of the tattooed hipster variety, but they were all friendly and helpful.  The Orchard has a pretty limited drink menu as well, but we each found libations which we enjoyed. I ordered a bowl of the tomato and basil bisque, which was awesome. The broccoli and potato soup was OK. Not as good as the bisque. I got the Jambalaya and I wasn't overly impressed with that either. I liked that it wasn't overly salty, but beyond that I found the flavors to be a little...bland. My husband got the Rockfish that was on special. He raved about it all night. Overall, dinner was good and I'm sure we'll be back.",
