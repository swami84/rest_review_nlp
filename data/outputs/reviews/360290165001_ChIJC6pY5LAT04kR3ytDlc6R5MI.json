If you are in the area and hungry for some sushi, give them try!!! You won\u2019t regret it. Sushi and dumplings are my fav. I would call in before you show up (especially during the pandemic and busy times of day / lunch rush). I\u2019ll keep coming back!!!",

To the point where I gave all of my orders to my friend.  As someone who has eaten sushi for almost three decades when you see certain menu items you know what to expect.  A Philadelphia roll is salmon with cream cheese.  A spider roll is usually either tempura fried shrimp or soft shell crab.  Spicy tuna is usually tuna chopped up with a spicy sauce.  The tuna had a grey pallor to it which is definitely a bag sign.  The menu on the website does not have descriptions which should have been enough to send me to one of my regular places.  But this was right down the street from Roswell hospital where I had just spent a few painful hours.  So it was convenient.",

        "caption": "How to describe this sublime experience? Picture, diner, this scene in your mind: treading hesitantly into a commercial structure, signage for this small eatery just barely visible from yonder sidewalk. Mayhap you found it on Yelp? Google Maps? The method is irrelevant, but the result is unforgettable.  At first you ask, \"where have I gone?\"  The decor is of clashing oranges and blues. The tables are haphazard, few, and cluttered with boxes and utensils. There are counters along one wall arranged with no semblance of order, and wires cross-cross the floor, wall, and surfaces, stretching hither and yon to power a vast array of objects.  Are you seated? Nay. Are there menus? Again, nay. Indeed, all signs point to the establishment not even wishing you to be there, with Doordash signs visible at every turn. The owners and workers are friendly, but direction is vague. Sit down? Okay. Are you staying? Well, I sat, so yes, thank you. Would you like a men-- oh, but of course, there are no menus.  Then, you are left to your own devices. Serve yourself, unless you want something specific. Sushi? Yes, it's on the sign, after all. It's all in containers, ready to be picked up and whisked away. Steamed dumplings? Indeed, but they taste more of the microwave than having truly been steamed, and despite there being signage suggesting multiple varieties, there is but one. Miso soup? Whether it's truly miso is questionable, but at least you have your pick of vessel: ceramic, paper, or carry-out.  Having picked up and eaten your food, how do you pay? With the staff so often back in the kitchen, it is largely based on the honor system. Did you have two of the stiff dumplings or six? Did you double-dip in the soup? An anarchistic approach to service leaves you wondering how to resolve these questions, but your guilt will lead you to the proper responses, unless you are truly incorrigible.  My final word is to avoid, unless you are simply picking up. Save yourself the confusion, my friend, and meander elsewhere for your midday fare.",
