This establishment really went above and beyond with providing an experience for me and my date. The dominant factor of that experience went beyond the amazing food  and music. It started with the Service of our waitress, named Alex. Often times you try new restaruants and i don't know if its just my luck or what, but the service is rather lack luster in most cases. That was definitely not the case here, as we were made right at home soon as we walked through the door, and felt as if we'd been there ten times before. We really want to recognize Alex and her service especially  for how busy it was that night. Thanks again, see you guys soon!",

They have a $20 valet for their lot, and only a very few pubic spots on Elston. Walked in, the music was pounding. They have a whole bottle service menu. I got the feeling that they are (or want to be) a nightclub. Just was not the vibe we wanted for a Wednesday dinner, and I did not get the feeling that a place with that focus would also have good food. We went to Alegrias.",

        "caption": "So I went here on a Saturday a couple weeks ago. The place appeared nice and Romantic ambiance. Our server was Yula and she was really nice up front. We were taking our time with menu and trying decide between drinks. Most of what they offer are straight drinks(typical 12-15 bucks) mixed drinks(15.00)and pitchers(60.00)We asked Yula about about tequila and she immediately says we have something that is great but cheaper than the prices listed and we were ok ordering two doubles. We ordered the fonduisa and chicken/steak/shrimp tacos. The fonduisa was burnt at bottom with chorizo stuck to the bottom of skillet and greasy. The shrimp was overcooked and over seasoned on top of chorizo. So not really great but moving on to tacos. There was nothing much to them. Meat lettuce and cilantro nothing spectacular. So we finished the food and was ready for bill. Yula comes to us and says BEFORE we even see the bill that she is going to ask the manager to come over to see if he can do something about the bill. Odd right...so I open it up and to my huge surprise we have been charged 144.00 for 2 double shots of tequila. The manager on cue walks over and says he can\u2019t do anything about it and pretty much dismissed the fact that we were mislead by the waitress. I asked what tequila I purchased and he wouldn\u2019t tell me at all. It literally tasted like casamigos anejo which an entire fifth is 47 bucks!. I had more than enough  to pay this ridiculous overcharged attempt at a \u201cmeal. Please make sure to ask up front what drinks your are being served or charged for. I was charged more for two drinks than 2 entrees and appetizer and those where not even worth the 64.00 dollars. Lesson learned. I would not recommend this restaurant. The food is mediocre and the information provided by our server was misleading. Lesson Learned. Will post receipt.",

I\u2019m not even sure how I found this restaurant, but I\u2019m thinking it was through Opentable, since that\u2019s how I made the reservation.  After checking out the restaurant\u2019s website, I was sold.  The website is so vibrant and exciting and immediately made we want to visit.  There were many options on the brunch menu for my friends with shellfish allergies and vegetarians. When I arrived for my reservation, our temperatures were checked on our wrist and we were shown to our table.  They had small cards on the table with the QR barcode to scan and see the menu.  As we sat down, the waiter / bartender Leo handed us welcome drinks (cranberry sangria).  He was very attentive and brought welcome drinks over whenever anyone new from my party arrived.  We ordered several drinks including the margarita flight that came in small patron bottles as well as a pitcher of the mango margarita.  We also ordered some chips and salsa and guacamole for the table to share - and even though we requested separate containers for the salsa and guacamole for the 6 of us, they were quick to supply our every request.  Our entrees also came out quickly and everyone in my party enjoyed their food.  I had a friend who knew that I was going to be at the restaurant for brunch and she called them to set up a special birthday surprise with the manager.  I was brought out a brownie dessert with ice cream and a pi\u00f1ata filled with candy and a gift card.  My friend said that the manager was a pleasure to work with and I felt so special.  The treatment from all the staff was top notch and my friends and I plan on visiting Azul again very soon!!!  Also, the DJ they had that day was AMAZING...my friends and I had so much fun listening to great music.",

The full menu was available on the rooftop due to the holiday, although there was a limited drink menu. The food took about 35 mins to get to us, and the server was great in checking in with us during this time.  We ordered langostinos, camarones a la diabla, and steak tacos. The langostinos were good and had the right amount of heat. The camarones were spicer. Steak tacos were fine, although very small.  There were no chips/salsa served while we waited for food. We did ask for tostadas to eat with our seafood and the server brought them out quickly. Overall, this is a different experience than typical mariscos place. It was nice and food was average. No huge complaints just wasn\u2019t our cup of tea. There are better mariscos places in Chicago.",

It still feels like the club it used to be (albeit during covid-19 times), but it's trying to be a restaurant. We made dinner reservations and therefore expected to eat dinner; however, we were seated on the roof deck, which has lovely views of the river and skyline, but where apparently you cannot get entrees or good cocktails, so that's a waste of time for the dinner patrons and space for the proprietor. We made the best of it by ordering lots of apps and shared plates and got our own drinks from the downstairs bar. The food was hit or miss - the elotes were excellent, the guacamole, empanadas, and crab legs were good, the aguachiles were disappointing. I can't speak to the entrees because we couldn't order them. All in all, for the prices of the food, I would expect better execution all around. It is still a beautiful spot, so I hope they figure out how to make it a sustainable restaurant.",

Made 6 attempts to call 911, and only got through on the 7th attempt. I went inside and notified staff about my incident. However, it baffles me that although, they have a security guard that does rounds around the lot-- and a valet guy that SITS OUTSIDE &  no one heard or saw a thing? Apparently, there is also no cameras on the outside of the restaurant either. $800-$1k worth of items just taken out of my car right before 8pm on a Sunday and the restaurant seemed to not give a damn.

It's a classy but fun oasis and i'm super impressed with how this group managed to transform this spot into something so cool in the middle of pandemic.  I went with a couple friends after dark last weekend, sat on the roof.  It was gorgeous; spacious, comfortable,  well-designed,  decor is on-theme but not overdone. Ample room to easily socially distance; and you see the staff working hard to make sure they're consistently cleaning.  Drinks were great.  Specialty cocktails were delicious, well presented, and packed a punch- and the rest of the beverage list has Latin-inspired drinks with a good balance of affordable and splurge-worthy stuff.  Food was stellar.  Seafood was fresh and well displayed and portioned/cut,  easy to eat socially.  The dishes were playful and unique but still very authentic.  Tons of surprising flavors.  (The burger was my personal fave, a perfect balance of chorizo and beef.)  Service was perfect.   Well staffed for the volume of the place, and super attentive; the team is clearly enjoying working there.  Atmosphere was amazing.  I've been to the building during previous operations (namely Estate) so I already knew it was a big unique spot with lots of potential;  so I was thrilled to see what they did to it. Roof was great, cabanas/high-tops/garden lights. The first floor/main bar/dining room area is a bright, art-filled, swanky space with multi-level/style seating and feels like it could be ocean-side instead of river-side.    From the roof we watched a few boats dock and come in for drinks.  This place is a great spot for families,  casual eats/drinks,  big nights out, and everything in between, and has the space for it.",

We ordered a few drinks - the Cantarito which is a true representation in taste and The Para\u00edso which has a delicious rim of ground espresso beans. I ordered the Pi\u00f1a Rellena (Stuffed pineapple with octopus, lobster, shrimp, grilled pineapple, chipotle cream sauce, topped with melted chihuahua cheese) and my husband ordered the Langostinos. OH EM GEE the presentation speaks volumes and the taste? Out of this world! Both absolutely delicious! Great menu, amazing experience, and super excited to come back and try the Seafood Tower!",
