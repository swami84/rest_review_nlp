The calamari from the appetizer menu for $17.50 and coffee. The calamari has to be the absolute best I've ever had. It's not breaded it's served with a lemony sauce and capers, along with toasted triangles which blend wonderfully with the leftover sauce. This is the only place I found where the calamari it's not breaded and I cannot overstate that it is the best I've ever enjoyed. It's my Friday night go to Restaurant. I will add that there wine list is impressive as well. call for reservations or you can enjoy eating in the entry bar area which is very nice as well before 5 p.m.",

I had the seafood crepe made with high quality melt-in-your mouth seafood and a rich cream sauce with just the right amount of rosemary and sherry.  My husband ordered the Cajun style cod served with a house made Cajun dipping sauce that was outstanding.  We both started with an excellent creamy mushroom soup and ended our lunch with their from-scratch red berry pudding with cream, very refreshing. You will find the restaurant classy yet casual, white linens, high quality tableware and fresh flowers at each table.  Our GPS brought us around the back side of the building so be aware.

Go in and dine and you'll love it.  Mariah, our waitress had that special talent of coming to us when we needed her, was very pleasant, and cared that we were celebrating and did some extra we enjoyed.  Chef Nancy, the owner was wonderful in her cooking skills and customer interaction showed the pride you'd hope an owner would display.  We will be going back soon!",

I am BEYOND picky... but EVERYTHING we had was good. They close the kitchen at 10, we arrived at 9:52, and they STILL allowed us to dine there. That was the first plus( & not once were they snooty or rushing us because of the time) the waiter was super friendly and very attentive. Our food was cooked quickly... another plus, and it wasn't half done. It was still cooked to our liking. I'm usually hard on my reviews, but I give this place 5+ stars. They were pretty pricey, but I didnt expect anything less because, of course, I read the other reviews, lol and I expected it anyway(because I figure it was a \"classy\" type of place). But I didnt mind because it was for my husband. And I thought the portions were worth the price, it was enough to fill us up. So I was happy about it, over all. We will more than likely return here before we leave alaska and I would recommend it to others as well... Oh yea... and we were there at 11:04(after closing) and the waiter didnt even mind taking our pictures. They made tonight perfect for my husband and I'm happy about it.",

Lunch at Jens' Restaurant is slow, but I think this is due to the lack of servers.  I think there were two servers for the entire restaurant.  The food is delicious, so you shouldn't worry about the quality.  I would just make sure you have plenty of time for lunch.  For dessert you have plenty to choose from, but don't forget the tawny ports.  You may not afford a bottle, but you can afford a sip of these very old ports.",

Tonight the service was incredibly slow, the food was served cold, and the ravioli appetizer was lacking flavor.  My husband consistently orders the king salmon, it was served undercooked, when we told the server she responded that it is always served medium rare (this was more rare than that), of the 12 times he has eaten that dish it has never been so undercooked. We were embarrassed about the entire experience since we raved about Jens to our friends and it came up very short. Unfortunately we will not be returning.",

Time after time they achieve excellence while most other restaurants in Anchorage are like going to a food lottery, a service lottery and a stupid-excuse-from-the-manager lottery where I have to sit through the latest cockamamie story from their managers explaining that the fish IS \"fresh\" you know... it was fresh when it was frozen, or, yes, she has worked in an indoor restaurant before, or mussels aren't supposed to be open, or they're not really drunk, it's just their personalities, or \"try them SAVanons, 'cause they're good but they're CHEAP, etc.. The other places are good one time, horrible the next, etc. Our little dining group is slowly working our way through the menu at Jen's and we haven't been disappointed yet by any of our selections. This week I celebrated my birthday at Jen's specifically because of their consistency out of hundreds of restaurants to choose from and again, it was absolutely perfect. The \"house\" salad is a silly name however when it shows up with numerous types of greens, assorted nuts, cheese, sliced strawberries and a dozen other ingredients. I think \"spectacular\" salad would be a better name. We had lamb... perfect, Black Cod... perfect, Charcuterie ... perfect, and I have forgotten what the fourth meal was because by the time my dinner arrived I was so excited that I didn't notice anything else until dessert arrived. And again... perfect. I don't know why I put up with some of the other restaurants in town for so many years. I guess that I just really wanted them to be good but they kept letting me down. Jen's is absolutely a treasure and I like every single thing about the restaurant, and not the least of these is that I can actually hear the conversations of the people that I'm dining with. If I could change anything about this restaurant I would move it to a really cute house on a lake, maybe, but then it would probably take me months to get a reservation, so I don't think that I would change even this detail. Life's too short to eat bad food or to be served by an idiot, I'm done abusing myself. In the future I'm going to Jen's or Marx Bros and that's it.",

        "caption": "Pepper steak is to die for, and you can order it for lunch or dinner! It's like cutting into butter and just melts in your mouth! When I want seafood I usually order the halibut. Love the mushrooms and the  beurre blanc sauce. Have enjoyed many fashions of scallops, rockfish, salmon and cod with different sauces the chef creates. Absolutely the nicest place for New Year's Eve dinner, including champagne, appetizers, duck black-eyed pea soup and choice of delights such as beef tenderloin topped with shallot butter over cabernet-braised wild mushrooms, king crab crepes or ahi tuna. The dessert is spectacular every year, and always different, but is almost always too beautiful a creation to eat! My favorite was the chocolate martini glass!! And with a complimenting wine and beer list, it truly is my favorite special place for dinner!",

        "caption": "First of all I arrived 30 minutes before opening time on Saturday (didn't look at a clock, belly said eat) and the folks said not to worry that they would take care of me.  Shortly after setting down the place filled up in no time flat with others thinking like me, mealtime. The service was that of what a restaurant should be and then some, my waiter knew about every item on the menu with great detail. I had Oysters Rockefeller for a starter, and lamb for the main dish.... oh what a treat. The only downside is my belly is smaller then the menu of some of my favorite dishes, which will make Jen's a regular stop for me when traveling thru Anchorage for some time now. Being a good cook myself I must say that this Restaurant passes my pickiness when it comes to a great meal. One may think the food is a bit pricey but for a person that dines out often when traveling, I will have to say it is only a few dollars more, making it money well spent.",
