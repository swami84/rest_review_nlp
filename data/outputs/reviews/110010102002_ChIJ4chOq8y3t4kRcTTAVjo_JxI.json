Everything was delicious, the covid protocols made us feel safe, and the drinks were the perfect pairing to dinner. We had the scallop crudo, hamachi crudo and grilled prawn for apps and while delicious, we should have ordered less so we would have more room for the main event. For our mains we ordered the fried chicken and the pork blade. Both were amazing and we wish we had fasted all day so we could've had more. Luckily the leftovers were just as tasty over the next few days. The fried chicken was the perfect balance of savory paired with the lightest and flakiest biscuits I've ever eaten. Our first experience was so great we ordered the fried chicken dinner to-go last week. It was a great value for a large amount of food that again lasted a few days for the two of us. The dessert (peanut butter pie) was top notch, I think it was the best thing my husband has ever eaten. We can't wait to visit again and try more menu items! Thank you for a wonderful experience.",

The combination of sauces and flavours are so creative and original but very reminiscent to traditional Vietnamese dishes. Who knew fried chicken would go so well with homemade hoisin sauce (typically eaten with Pho) or butter in chilli sauce. We would definitely come back here again!",

The GM and the Chef came to our table which only put a bow on the experience.   Since dining there on Friday evening, I have told at least 4 people to make their way to Moon Rabbit.  I can't wait to go back and have another great moment. Chanta, our waitress, was perfection--I don't think I've ever had a more genuine & thoughtful waitress/server in my life---she made the experience ...perfection.  THANK YOU!.",

We ordered the grilled prawns, pate w/ scallop crudo, fried quail w/ biscuits, chicken pate, bo luc lac, and the rabbit salad. For dessert, we had the ca phe flan,  pineapple milk bun, che chu oi. Drink wise definitely recommend the Vietnamese coffee and the District 11 drink.  We definitely enjoyed the rich pate and bo luc lac the most. The pate was so good we had to order more bread. The bo luc lac was more like a steak perfectly cooked with a side of potatoes and caramelized onions. Plenty for the 5 of us. The quail is a must order if you love fried chicken. It was breaded just like Southern fried chicken and the biscuits was great when dipped in their house made butter was delicious. Make sure you save room for dessert. One word to describe all of them TEXTURES! The pineapple bun was moist and fresh. The che chu oi had this coconut mouse with delicious mango and banana sorbet. We had to wait a while for the che but so worth it.  I love the concept here. Definitely elevated Vietnamese food with a French twist. Now this is the wharf you are going to be paying a premium, but its well worth it. They have an extensive menu to satisfy all flavor profiles. Overall, my friends and I really enjoyed our experience here. We'll definitely be back to sample more of Chef Kevin's innovative menu",

As we entered, we used the hand sanitizer provided and took a seat on the outdoor patio distant from other diners. Indoor seating is an option if you feel comfortable. The outdoor space is along the main Wharf's boardwalk with river views and people watching.  2) Drinks: The cocktail menu is pricey, but if you're okay with a $15 cocktail, order the District 11. It's a refreshing sweeter cocktail made from St. Germain, yuzu juice and cucumber tonic.  3) Food: We only went for drinks so I can't speak to the food outside of the pineapple milk bun. (If you go for just drinks, they ask you buy one food item.) The milk bun is large, not-too-sweet and comes with hoison butter. I enjoyed it!",

I was very excited to hear about this new restaurant and immediately made reservations for dinner and invited a friend.  Browsing through the menu, I had a hard time deciding which dish to order and which drink to compliment my meal.  So to help make my decision, I always ask the waiter, \u201cwhat are the most popular dishes that I should order?\u201d  Most times I get great recommendations and this meal added to that list of great recommendations.  Cocktails: - Dissenting Opinion \u2013 very tasty.  Not too sweet.  Enjoyed it, especially if you are a scotch fan. - District 11 \u2013 very refreshing.  Can\u2019t really taste the yuzu. Cucumber paired well with the overall drink.  Recommend.  Appetizer: - Pineapple Milk Bun with Hoisin butter \u2013 soft bun with a cookie crust \u2013 exactly how it should be.  Served warm with a side of hoisin butter.  Wish they gave more butter.  This bun was really good! - Kombujime Scallop Crudo with Tom kha, pickled pearl onion and shiso. So light and packed with flavor!  That tom kha flavor is all there in each bite.  Must try!  Main: - Chao Cua Carolina Gold congee with local crab, okra, dark roux and furikake. Pretty tasty but not overly excited about it.  Paired well with the pork.  Flavorful and has the right consistency of congee.  If you don\u2019t know what congee it, it is basically a rice soup that is boiled with a flavorful stock. - Lemongrass Pork Blade Steak served with Lettuce, coconut rice and an herb bouquet. Very flavorful and loved the charred taste of the pork.  Thick slice pork with just the right amount of fat.  Served with lettuce for your to wrap the meat with the herbs and coconut rice.  Also came with two sauces, once of which had garlic and pickled jalapenos.   Very tasty and highly recommend!  Lemongrass flavor is prominent.  Dessert: - Condensed milk flan topped with coffee caramel and chocolate pearls.  Tasty and pretty simple dessert.  Nothing too fancy.  Flavorful.  The caramel tasted more like salted caramel than a coffee caramel.  COVID Safety \u2013 everyone is wearing a mask and you must wear a mask until seated at the table.  Hand sanitizers are available at the entrance to the restaurant and there is a plexiglass at the hostess table to protect them and vice versa.  There are outdoor seats with heater lamps.  Tables are seated at least 6 feet apart.  Overall, highly recommend this new restaurant.  Service was top notch and food was good.  Make sure to make reservations!",

The music played to the rhythm perfectly in sync with my chewing- that's what some good jazz does- dance while you eat. I wanted to leave a 5 star review just after finishing the appetizers. My waitress was very accommodating, sweet and polite- Janaye took very good care of my wife and I on our 1 year anniversary. I ordered the district 11 cocktail- which made me buzzed after finishing it in under 5 minutes, my serotonin was flowing into a light buzz. After every bite I locked eyes with my wife and we were giving to the food and music  we knew the night was leading into a food coma. Our first dish was the chicken liver pate and scallops. With each bite that I took I closed my eyes as each chew took me into oblivion causing my brain to go into euphoria. I was so excited for the next dishes. The venison carpaccio had a very nice spice to it! At this point I wanted to lay my head on my wife's lap and have her sing sweet nothings into my ear. I was eagerly awaiting my 16 oz ribeye especially as a steak connoisseur. Each bite was so well balanced between the fat and meat the amount of juiciness made my jaw quiver. I knew at this point I was going to remember this dinner forever- reminiscing it on a summer day in my rocking chair, telling my grandkids how the food slipped my mind in a different dimension. At this point, the chef is my hero. My taste buds are dancing in my mouth starting they're own party. Soon after Chef Kevin comes out to hear about our take on his food. You're missing out if you don't come here- it's an epic adventure.",

I love Vietnamese food so I was initially disappointed to see that there was no Pho on the menu, but they put together creative dishes with Vietnamese flavors that made it just as fun to try something new.",

The service was top notch, very attentive and thoughtful of cleanliness protocols. The setting is excellent--inside the Intercontinental Hotel, right along the water at The Wharf.",
