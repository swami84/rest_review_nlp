        "caption": "I grew up in Cleveland, and had visited Chef Sawyer's restaurant there on a trip home. I also followed the career of such a notable chef from my hometown. Needless to say, I was excited to hear that he was bringing his talents to Chicago, and Saturday night my wife and I visited for an anniversary dinner.  First off, the service was exceptional. We have been cautious due to covid, and no restaurant has made us feel as safe as this one. Despite the distance, there was no lack of warmth from the staff. Everyone seemed genuinely excited to assist us from the moment we entered until the moment we left.  On to the food, there's really not much to say other than it's phenomenal. Chef Sawyer's elevated and technique-focused takes on comfort food are a little bit subversive for the posh Four Seasons space, but that makes it even better. The 3-day process to create the chicken wings comes through from the first bite, and the truffle poutine is as good as poutine gets.  Being a steak enthusiast, I was please to find the harder-to-find Picanha cut on the menu. It was butchered, cooked, and presented beautifully. My wife's Halibut was rich, sweet, flaky perfection.  It's a challenging time to be opening a restaurant, but if you want a safe place to get out and enjoy the work of an incredible chef and team, you can't go wrong picking here.",

        "caption": "My husband & I moved to Chicago from Cleveland years ago, and when we heard Chef Sawyer was opening up a restaurant in Chicago, we knew we needed to be one of the first to dine because we missed his wings & more. We had dinner on the first night of opening at Adorn - October 1, 2020. Adorn does not disappoint! Sawyer's signature dishes have been \"adorned\" to an elevated state. The wings! The frites! The steak! The fried chicken! And some new favorites we discovered tonight! All dishes were served in a very timely manner, even on opening night. Service was spectacular - as one \"expects\" from the Four Seasons.",
