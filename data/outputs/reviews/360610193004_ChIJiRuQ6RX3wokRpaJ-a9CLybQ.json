I ordered palak paneer, samosas, vegetable biryani and partha. When I got my order it came with yogurt sauce and tamarind chutney.  So good. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Huge plus. Now the food. The one item I was looking forward to the most was the samosas. I was very disappointed because they were cold. I'm not sure if this is how they are served at this particular restaurant, but I was definitely not loving it. The palak paneer was good. Paneer is one of my favorite dishes. Huge cheese lover here. The partha was a good combination to eat the paneer with. This was my first time trying partha. I definitely enjoyed it. The vegetable biryani took the cake. I am loving the fragrance and taste of all the spices used to make it. It had chunks of potato and cauliflower. Yummmmm! The portion is ridiculously generous. I'd definitely go back to this restaurant if it weren't for the samosas. I'll have to shop around to other Indian restaurant to see where I can get them the way I like them.",

It did not taste like butter chicken at all- there was a very weird smell in the curry and chicken. So after that 1 bite we did not consumer anymore. Haleem was okay. The beef boti roll - there were countful pieces of beef boti - literally 4 small boti's and  alot of lettuce. The roll happen to open while heating it and thats how i could tell how many boti in there. Boti was extremely dry. Paratha is so big as compared to the filing in it.  Ordered 1 chicken and 1 beef boti roll for a friend who said the same about their rolls..  In total i paid a total of $60 for both the orders and that neither one of could enjoy.. not going back nor recommending this place to anyone. Not worth spending so much.",
