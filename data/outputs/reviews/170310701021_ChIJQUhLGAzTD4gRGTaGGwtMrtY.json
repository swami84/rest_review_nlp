The food portions and quality have substantially dropped, and feels very overpriced for what you get! Not impressed and unlikely to visit again.

When I walked in I looked and felt like a kid in a candy store. My sister was surprised and delighted ( her face said it all) and that\u2019s a hard task to achieve. I went for the French toast (OMG) and ended up leaving with the deli sandwiches ( turkey, corned beef and pastrami). This place is so good,  we came back the very next day got waffles and took more deli sandwiches for later on. The mimosas... Whoowee!! This place is clean...the bathroom, the floors even the corners of the tables. The food tastes fresh and doesn\u2019t have the commercial undertones in taste. The waitstaff and service was as if I\u2019d walked into someone\u2019s home. Everyone was personable, down to earth. I wIll be visiting this establishment again very soon!!! I would especially like to thank the Chef for making both our birthday\u2019s a most memorable one.  IMG_2641.JPG",

The good: 6 years ago the menu was strictly diner, which was fine but also lacked any variety or healthy options. Sometimes that's what you look for, but I was glad to be overwhelmed with options this time around. There's something for everyone, no matter what they're in the mood for. The waffle was large, fluffy, and packed with flavor thanks to the blueberry compote on top of it. There's also a ton more seating, and we didn't have to wait even though we had a party of 5 on a Sunday.  The not-so-good: The service was iffy at times and took a little longer than was expected, as was our wait for the food. The prices can also climb quickly if you're not careful, and the new atmosphere will certainly be cliche and tacky for some.  Food/drink: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10",

Our waitress even came ta get me after she brought our food to the table, because I was off taking pictures.  There can be a wait here, but tables also turn over fairly quickly, and the host(ess) will get yer number ta text you, so you can wander around the neighborhood if you like, instead of waiting there. We went and got coffee at Colectivo, which is just a few doors down.  The place is decorated in a fun, eclectic, whimsical way. If puts one in mind of a restaurant one might find in the French Quarter. It's bright & well lit so even though the tables are quite close together, it doesn't feel cramped. That being said, if one suffers from claustrophobia, this may not be the best place fer you, unless you can get a booth. The tables are VERY close together. The place is also loud, but not in that, \"I can't have a conversation here!\" way, there are just a lot of conversations, hustle & bustle, & folks enjoying the delicious offerings of the place.  This was definitely one of those places that has me very much wanting to come back, as there were so many items on the menu that I still wasn't to try, and the prices are quite reasonable. They have specials as well, so there is always something new ta try. This is a highly recommended experience!!!",

Then, when we noticed her set up our table outside (knew it was ours by the number of seats and the high chair) we walked over to it (we had not sat down and only walked over after it had been set up for 5 or so minutes without a text or notification from the hostess) she walked by and said \u201cwell since you made yourselves at home...then go ahead.\u201d  Our server was a little better (definitely not openly rude)...but not very attentive. My wife\u2019s sandwich came out missing almost half of the listed ingredients. Just chicken, tomato, lettuce, and a bun. No garlic aioli, no grilled vegetables. My chicken and waffles were okay. Definitely the smallest chicken breast I\u2019ve had served in a chicken and waffle dish. The sweet potato waffle was actually very good.  To top it off, the chef (who\u2019s picture is prominently displayed outside on a street sign) was more concerned with SITTING at the table next to us loudly scolding (what I can only assume was a family member) about only tipping his server $1 last time he ate there after his meal had apparently been comped. I overheard him say something to the effect of \u201cYou know you never have to bring your wallet when you come to one of my restaurants...but you have to tip the staff.\u201d This conversation lasted at least 20 minutes. This was in between the other times he was standing out front shooting the breeze with what appeared to be several different groups of personal friends who were eating at the restaurant. He was still sitting at the table when we left.  He wasn\u2019t walking around checking on tables, clearly wasn\u2019t in the kitchen making sure food came out with all the proper ingredients, or supervising his hostess who was rude to our group and several others we overheard.  We only stayed for our meal because the wait at several nearby brunch restaurants was 30+ minutes. However, I\u2019m certain we will not be back.",

Everything here looks amazing; we kept oogling the food of everyone around us. Plus it's decorated nicely and the staff is friendly. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",

It\u2019s very quaint and a bit intimate when packed but no worries because so far most patrons seem to be just as friendly as the staff! I guess it\u2019s all the great vibes and energy from the decor and staff rubbing off on everyone! My first visit there Chef Rylon came out and talked with us, I love his energy and commitment very nice, personable, attentive guy! Parking is highly competitive find street parking and enjoy your stroll, you may not get a close park.  Food: to freaking die for! That\u2019s all I got! No, but seriously the food is super bomb/fire/good af/delicious!!!  Mimosa flight is a must and very reasonably priced! May fave is peach and prickly pear. French toast flight is awesome! My fave is caramel apple and lemon! The maple butter I believe it is, is good enough to eat alone! Bacon flight was such a dope experience! I heart the duck bacon, flavorful and moist! Oh I have also had the jerk turkey patty- nothing more to say!!! Love the cheesy hash but eat quickly as they cool it gets hard/tough to work with. I did have the breakfast potatoes and so far I would say that\u2019s the only thing which lacked pizazz/flavor. Spinach and mushroom omelet is classic with a good garlic/pesto sauce. Oh and  the executive ribeye is also very flavorful.",

One of the owners Chris came and asked how our experience was and I mentioned that it was great and this food would be really fun to do in our office. He took down my information and when I left expected nothing more. He then followed up the next day with a menu to cater to our office. I was very surprised and excited he would go out of his way to accommodate. The restaurant then catered our office for an event we had going on the following week and couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome. Not only does this place have amazing food but that experience alone solidified the type of people that work there. Great job to the team and thank you Chris for taking such care of us!!",

Now, the place clearly caters to a trendier, less down-to-earth crowd. I couldn\u2019t believe they painted over the coolest mural inside with hashtagbasic framed sayings like \u201cYes way ros\u00e9\u201d and \u201cBrunch without booze is just a sad, lonely breakfast\u201d. They must\u2019ve gotten that idea off of Pinterest. \ud83d\ude44  The only reason I\u2019m giving this place an extra star is because of my lovely waitress, who sympathized with my surprise at all the changes. She did a great job at recreating the Reuben omelette for me, and it wasn\u2019t too bad. Ridiculously priced, but not bad. (Other one was definitely the best!)  The place should be renamed. No part of this restaurant is the same as the Frances\u2019 from before. Be original in your new ownership rather than ride off of what once was. Painting over that mural was such a bad move, too. SUCH a silly move. Why did you do that?!",

Eventually, the Chef stopped by to make sure that everything was OK. I enjoyed their sausage biscuit and gravy, though the gravy needed a little more sausage.

The meat was ell cooked and was moist and delicious. The fries that accompanied it were great as well.  They have some outdoor seating, inside it is much like a diner with a lot of wood, wodden walls, tables and chairs. They also have a vintage coke machine. I would say the service is a little slow, but I was with friends and was jabbering a lot, so I didn't really notice.  Go here if you want a solid brunch option.",

Her response hmm...and continued the conversation about the check..I move to the hostess and ask again for the check, manager appears with what a 12.00 check..are you kidding, a sorry apology and here's the bill..

I don't know what they put into them but those pancakes taste way too good to be healthy, LOL. Their omelettes are good, too. But where I have not had the best experience is with their lunches. The lunch food is tasty but overpriced for what they give you. My husband and I went there for lunch this past weekend and got two sandwiches and an iced tea. The sandwiches were regular-sized, by the way - it's not like they were gargantuan sandwiches. But the bill with tax and tip ended up being over $45. Are you kidding me? WAY too expensive for what we got. I'll be back ONLY for the pancakes and omelettes. Never again for lunch.",
