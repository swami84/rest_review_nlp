I wish that there was a 6 or 10 star rating option. Real talk, this is the absolute best food I have ever had. And the great energy and enthusiasm for good food and flavors from the kitchen staff is prevalent in thing you order. It's so awesome seeing the chefs have fun making your food, how could it not be amazing. AND ITS (ALL) AMAZING, from the folded burger (oh my lord, the folded burger, yooooo) to the chicken joint and the mushroom pita, oh my sheesh. Oh and don't forget about that steak joint either the candy or the ribeye! Yo when people say food is love... this is the epitome. Please do yourself a favor and go see these guys and fill up. You will be back!!! Believe that.",
