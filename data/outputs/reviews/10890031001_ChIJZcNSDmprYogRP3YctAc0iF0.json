The way the restaurant is arranged, our table made the ambience quite poor. Facing the large window that faces the main hallway to the VBC, made for an unpleasant dining experience when we were after some quiet and perhaps a small amount of privacy. Our server was perfunctorily polite, but not engaging. My drink order was mixed up and I didn't receive the drink I ordered. When I asked if it could be fixed, server stated that they would have to consult the manager. Not wishing to be difficult, I elected to simply order a new (correct) drink. After deciding upon appetizer and entrees, drinks arrived and then the appetizer. White cheddar pimento spread was good, but not great. Would recommend carrot chips vice carrot sticks for serving. Carrot sticks are not the easiest to combine with this dip. Entrees arrived and immediately noticed a problem. Sides on my plate were incorrect, as were the sides on my wife's plate! Specifically I was given the wrong vegetable, and my wife was given the wrong kind of potatoes. After a few minutes of waiting, I was finally able to notify server of the problem My wife didn't bother asking to replace her side, but I asked for the correct side to be added to my plate. Entrees we did have were well prepared and flavorful. Wife enjoyed the trout and I enjoyed a well-cooked filet. However, after the incorrect drink order and the mixed up sides on our entree plates, we elected not to order a dessert. Overall not a 5 star experience. Would have liked to have better ambience/quiet/privacy, drink order fulfilled incorrectly and wrong sides on entree plate. On the positive side, well prepared and flavorful entrees. However I'd expect more out of a restaurant trying to be more upscale.",

The female manager was extremely rude during this whole ordeal. We left after 2 hours without a properly cooked steak. Every other food item was just mediocre. The cocktails were ok.

Downstairs has more food options  and some Gluten Free things that look appetizing but I've not tried those yet so this review is mainly for the upstairs bar area.  Good happy your and menu is attached.  I had the Alabama Street Tacos on Taco Tuesday ($1 each) and they were decent.  Old Fashion was good and the second was even better with a little feedback to the bartender about my personal preferences. Mars Mule was refreshing and not too sweet.  I'd recommend it.  The atmosphere is why I'd come back and recommend you try it.  It was really cool.  Love the rooftop feel and that's hard to find in Huntsville.  4* on food and drinks based on my limited experience 5* on atmosphere and thus my rating",

I had the chicken nacho it was very dry no cheese and  I wasn\u2019t aware it had slaw on top very different.  All around the food was a bit disappointing just not my cup of tea, however; the atmosphere was awesome.  Great waitress and nice staff.  Stop by check it out for yourself if in the area.

By the end of the night he was solo and confident with all our ridiculous requests and split our large party check perfectly. Chris was on top of drinks and our food the entire night. His training partner was also amazing, but I\u2019ve forgotten her name. And finally, on her way in, my sister\u2019s shoe literally fell apart. Teresa, who runs Rhythm, hunted down two tubes of super glue and helped her fix it on the steps outside the restaurant. Teresa was also ALWAYS present on the floor and working with and around the staff. Beyond service, the rooftop is AMAZING and is a beautiful escape in the heart of downtown Huntsville.",
