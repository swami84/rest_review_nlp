We went on a more chilly day, on division most of the other restaurants had their dining umbrellas out because its a tree lined street and heat lamps due to the weather change.  Bonchon only had table and chairs available but keep the heat lamps and umbrellas in the dining room in eyeyesight of street views.  Not sure of the reason why but we went because if a Groupon and drove from Hyde Park.  Because of the distance I couldn't carry out because I wanted to taste it fresh and have a real Bonchon experience.  I will say the food was wonderful.  We had a 12pc dinner special with half spicy, half soy wings.  They starter was some very tasty & crunchy fries that were cooked perfectly.  The wait was not long at all so our chicken, fried rice, cole slaw and picked radishes came out pretty quickly.  The chicken was also cooked perfectly with the right amount of crisp on the outside and super moist on the inside. Very flavorful and great sauce.  The spicy was no joke for my palette but soo good.  I was able to eat 2 pieces with the cole slaw to help with the heat.  I would return but not to this location. Luckily we have one closer in China Town that ill visit.  The food was delicious and worth 7 stars, but the experience with our new normal of dining outdoors due to COVID and trying to support businesses felt like a slap on the hand.  I would say don't offer outdoor seating if you don't want to fully commit. Just my two cents.",

I will NEVER go here again! I suggest you do the same and save yourself the utter disappointment and frustration. We took my mother and sister here for lunch. They have a lunch special which CLEARLY specifies on THEIR menu Mon - Friday 11:30 AM to 3 PM. We were sat at our table and the waitress came over a good 10-15 mins later and apologized for the wait, it was around 1:45 at this point. We began ordering from the lunch menu and then she stopped us and told us that this was over because the system had already changed \ud83e\udd14 ..... Both my husband and I pointed to the time stated on the menu in frustration and the waitress began to argue with me about why it was over, clearly scamming. Her reasoning made no sense.  In addition to this, we ordered the bulgogi tacos which are promoted as having THREE tacos - we received 2 tacos filled with nothing but lettuce and two very tiny pieces of meat.  To conclude: this place is too pricy for the lackluster customer service and food! Do better, or please close (:",

No, they do not have wifi BUT my server got me the log in anyway. This is great service and I appreciated the access.  The lunch itself was fine. The food wasn't cheap ($13ish for 2 tacos and iced tea), but seemed high quality and fresh. The proportions in tacos were not ideal - way more lettuce and sauce than anything else. (Maybe that is how most Korean tacos are ?)  The space is cute and service is good, location is great. Overall, not bad.  If I went back, I would avoid the lunch specials menu and just order from the regular menu because the price cut isn't as significant as the portion cut.",

There were 7 of us and everybody ordered something different. The chicken was great. The wings, drumsticks and tenders were quite crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. The spicy sauce had a good kick to it. The Bonchon sauce was just a bit salty for me but had good flavor. One of the sides available is pickled daikon which I highly recommend. The soups were delicious with plenty of veggies. The ramen were fresh and silky. The marinated beef slice dishes were also excellent. The kimchee as a side was a great accompaniment. Prices were very reasonable. Service was quite quick even though they were busy. A fabulous place for lunch or dinner just west of Woodfield mall on Golf road (Illinois 58). Free parking and wheelchair accessible.",

The strips take less time to cook, so if time is of the essence, try the boneless rather than the bone-in, but do try them. I ordered the japchae, my mum the bibimbap. We were both well pleased withour food although intolerances meant I had to remove some of my vegetables, and I would have liked a few more. The bibimbap was served in a sizzling crock that continued to sizzle and gave the rice a nice crispy crust on the bottom. The service was prompt and very courteous and I would not hesitate to go here again.",

She said very little and matched the energy she gave over the phone. Still, I ignored it and paid for my order. I ordered the combo chicken lunch special w/ fries and the house fried rice lunch special.  The price wasn\u2019t bad for the amount of food I received, but the chicken could\u2019ve used a lot more sauce then what was presented to me. Also, be sure to ask for condiments and silverware if needed. I had only two packets of ketchup in my bag and nothing else.  Prior to visiting this place I was on a Google search for Korean sticky chicken and this was one of the locations it suggested. Maybe I will try Crisp or Dak next time to see if I can actually get what I really want.  Overall, the food wasn\u2019t bad, the price is doable, but the customer service could be better.",

The soy garlic wings are also excellent. They are flavorful but not too overbearing with the garlic. The pickled radishes are a great side companion. The seafood house fried rice is also great. It is delicious and has a good amount of seafood in it. The drink selection is pretty good as well; handful of options to choose from. The soju is delicious as well. We got the lychee and mango flavored soju and both were good, but I liked the lychee better. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and welcoming and very attentive. The bathrooms are clean. The restaurant is clean and modern in decor. Street parking is ample. I would highly recommend this spot for grabbing dinner or late night eats.",

Had the tofu Bi Bim Bap bowl and it was good, the tofu was a little under seasoned but beside that this place is awesome.  I will defiantly be back for a casual lunch or dinner.",

Others who were seated and ordered after me got their food before I did. It wasn't the servers fault - the woman acting as expediter didn't make my order a priority and maybe forgot to fire it. Rice was good. But plain. Chicken cutlet was a bit dry and not enough brown sauce. Not really special or worth going back to.  Restaurant was a third full and i waited more than 20 minutes for a flash fried chicken breast on rice.",
