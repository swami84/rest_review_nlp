We ordered a Queen Berry sweet crepe, savory crepe #2 with mozzarella + ham + bacon, and an iced caramel macchiato.  The coffee was ready before the food which allowed us to get our caffeine fix while we waited.  The coffee tasted great, quality espresso and just the right amount of sweetness. Within a few minutes our crepes were ready and brought to our table.  The savory crepe was delicious. The bacon inside was perfectly crispy, not greasy. The savory crepe was served with some tomato and cucumber slices and some roasted red pepper spread (ajvar) on the side. The Queen Berry sweet crepe had a good amount of nutella (without being too heavy) and was topped with chocolate sauce, plenty of fresh strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. The sweet crepe was served with whipped creme on the side, felt homemade but not sure, either way it was very good and balanced the dish.  The crepes themselves were thin (as they should be) and cooked to perfection. Overall, the quality, flavor, and service was excellent.  The portions were very generous and we packed our leftovers for an afternoon snack.  We're not in the area often but I have a feeling we will make the trip just to come to Crepe House. We highly recommend.",

Conveniently located in the same lot as Seafood City, it was easy to find, so you can easily park inside the plaza. There are a couple of tables and chairs outside too. When arriving inside, there is hand sanitizer available and the tables are marked off to show which ones are available to use for dine in. The young lady who took care of us was really welcoming and kind, she took our order and let us know she would bring out our crepes to us. We ordered the strawberry banana one and the Oreo one. The cafe is nice and cool to relax in this warm weather and plays upbeat music for that I'm about to eat good crepes mood. She brought our crepes to our table and also some ice cold cups of water for completion. They were out of this world delicious!! Big crepes, not small, can be shared between two or one if you're up for it like I was! Freshly made and nice and warm and filled with delicious fruit and or cookies and topped off perfectly and some good ol' whipped cream on the side. Superb tasting, great price, close to home, very cautious of sanitation and hygiene measures, and excellent customer service. She let my princess have some ice cream after, so sweet! Will definitely recommend and come back!",

We got the Oreo and strawberry banana crepe at first (since it was Wednesday, we each got a scoop of icecream with the crepes), and I quickly went for the Ham and Cheese after.  The sweet crepe was massive and only $8, which you can not get anywhere else we've gone. The crepe batter itself was perfectly sweetened and the fillings were more than generous (even the Nutella, which tends to be treated more like truffle in sweets shops) and presentation was much better than I was expecting.  In the end, we came in because I love crepes and we will be back in again because I fell in love with these crepes.",
