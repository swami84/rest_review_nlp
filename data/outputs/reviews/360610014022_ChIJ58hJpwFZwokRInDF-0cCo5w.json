We ordered 7 dishes for a group of four and we thought it's more than enough. However, she kept recommending us to order more and more. We felt pressured and ended up packing leftover home.  Their food was overall delicious and authentic especially the Beef Brisket Stew w/ Potato ($26) and Saute\u0301ed Shrimp w/ Salted Egg Yolk ($27). The brisket was well braised, so flavorful and tender. The salted egg yolk sauce was creamy, rich and perfect with fried shrimp.

IDK how this menu could be tourist-friendly, given their location on Clinton St. i'm a huge fan of fusion and modern asian joints, but 3 Times just missed the mark for me.  \u867e\u8089\u5c0f\u7b3c xiao long bao (pork & shrimp): OK. it's not Shanghai Cafe or Joe's Shanghai good, but it'll do. $8.75 tho? ugh. \u7279\u5236\u8471\u6cb9\u997c scallion pancakes: tasty, crispy and good- but nothing special about it at all. not worth the price tag at all. \u5357\u65b9\u9c9c\u8089\u5927\u5305 pork buns: yummy on the inside and i liked this. \u4e1c\u5761\u8089 braised pork belly was sooooo fatty- there was nothing to eat except fat. \u8c46\u9f13\u6392\u9aa8 steamed pork spare ribs in black bean sauce: i did not like at all. i can get the same thing when i get cha and dim sum.  location? convenient. service? impeccable. eco-friendly utensils. how nice! busy? not at all. pricey? yes...",
