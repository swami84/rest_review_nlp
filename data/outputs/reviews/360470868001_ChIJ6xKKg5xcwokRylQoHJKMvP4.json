This weekend we decided to try another location closer to home and we were successful finally. My daughter had the classic lobster roll and I had the salmon roll and they were both disappointing. Both were very bland except for the excessive salt, on the rolls as well as the fries. We are really trying to support black owned businesses, but the quality of the food has to be comparable or better than fast food chains. I could have gotten better food for less else where. I took two bites of my roll and threw the rest out. My daughter was so hungry she forced herself to eat half of hers but she said it was nasty. I would not recommend this to anyone.",

I visited the Myrtle Avenue location and purchased the Bed-stuy Biggie and the Classic BK Lobster Roll which cost me 50.00 dollars. While I did not expect to have a pound of lobster on the rolls but I surely expected more than a tablespoon full for that amount of money. In addition, both sandwiches were extremely salty and just poorly prepared. I Love supporting our local shops but I don\u2019t think I will be returning",

My friend ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and there was barely any lobster in it and the zesty corn was trash as well. The place looks nice, but the food was subpar unfortunately.",

I put  lobster allergy which simply means try not to get any lobster into my food. Simple. Change gloves move to another table. They refunded my order and delivered my boyfriends food then \u201cclosed\u201d Learn how to service your allergy costumers By simply following doh guidelines learn how to maintain your online menu!! This way you won\u2019t have to turn down a loyal costumer.  you saw vegan and allergy on one order and got intimidated. Possibly Due to lack of knowledge. Or a fussy chef. Either way it was handled poorly  But damn the food is good",

Fast delivery and tons of fries. Also love the cut and seasoning of the fries. Ordered again yesterday via Seamless. Again didn't skimp on the fries, delivery was fast, lobster was perfect but this time I got a biscuit that had lobster in it as a side. Filling, larger than I thought, came with 2 biscuits. Very good. Different from Red Lobsters biscuit but enjoyable. I've ordered pricer lobster lobster rolls for less meat and taste so 10/10 would recommend trying this spot.",

I will make this easy we ordered (2) BK BIGGIE LOBSTER ROLLS, (1) SALMON ROLL, (3) DRINKS ALL MEALS CAME WITH A DRINK and (2)8 PIECE ORDERS OF WINGS.  Pros: lobsters roll and salmon roll flavor was good, wings were good, the french fries that came with the salmon roll were seasoned well from what I was told, drink were great (we had the sodas)  Cons: how we waited was not customer friendly we stood in the establishment for at least 10 minutes before someone came out after another customer started yelling \" Hello, Hello!\" I felt someone should have at least come out and said we will be with you momentarily or something, then it took forever to get the order we were told would take a half an hour it took longer. No one addressed this situation with a sorry for the wait or anything there was not enough lobster to call this a \"biggie\" anything the menu says it is double the meat I do not want to know what a regular would have in it. The fries were cold by the time we recieved our order.  Also suggest a wedge of lemon for the lobster roll would be nice",

No outdoor seating area available but many local parks that can be sat in if you need fresh air and a little lunch.  My companion and I ordered the BedStuy Biggie Lobster Roll and the Bay Ridge Lobster Roll. Omg....  Those rolls were dynamite. The roll is soft with a nice bite so it doesnt dilapidate. The Bay Ridge Roll had the perfect balance of sweet peppers to lobster to the little spicy mayo that I was scarfing the roll down in seconds. Lol maybe a little dramatic but I definitely was eating and singing the praises of the Lord.  The BedStuy Biggie had the lobster spilling out of the roll. I couldn't believe that it had juicy high quality lobster in it. Definitely worth a try if you are hungry.  Each roll came with fries and spicy mayo. The fries were a great way to start/ finish the meal. Spicy mayo fry combo made me never want to use ketchup again. Fries and spicy mayo for life!!!  Hope y'all get a chance to stop by and check it out!",

He took care of us until the other staff arrived. Let me jus say the food, delicious. We Had the lobster and waffles, shrimp and waffles and the loaded fries. The loaded fries had an ample amount of lobster and healthy amount of fries. The waffles where delicious and fluffy and the shrimp and lobster seasoned well. My wife truly enjoyed and she is quite picky. I give it 5 stars and will definitely come back. P.S. try the Main Root Sarsparilla.",

Waited 45min for a lobster roll and fries...Lobster roll was pretty good and flavorful....fries tasted a bit stale as if they've been sitting out all day.. that was a bit odd being that it was only 8pm.. While i waited for my meal, i wasn't offered a drink menu or even a complimentary glass of water. The 2 workers lacked people skills n that they didn't keep me updated with the status of my order.. i had to keep asking. Once my food arrived i asked that they add lettuce to my lobster roll. She then took it back to the kitchen, and a few mins later returned back to place my meal in the bag. I wanted to see what changed so i asked to see my food before she placed it in the bag... she waited until i opened the tray to tell me that they ran out of lettuce.. umm ok...Place has great potential.

They have several menu options to choose from and although they are a bit pricey, the friendly staff, amazing food, and timely service makes up for that. Quality can never be argued. I am disappointed because the last two times I've visited, I've noticed that the lobster rolls are now filled with 50% less lobster meat and the terra cotta chips have now been replaced with sweet potato fries. Definitely not an even exchange and although I will still patronize, it won't be as often. I do understand business, cost efficiency, and practicality so I'm still going to give a great review. Tuesdays and Thursdays are great if you're looking for a great vibe.",

It is conveniently located on Nostrand Ave between Herkimer Street and Atlantic Avenue. It is easily accessible by car, subway, and bus.  There are twelve different lobster roll choices to choose from. Some of the names of the lobster rolls are familiar names that we've heard before and some are named after Brooklyn neighborhoods. There is an $100 Golden Lobster Roll which consists of 3 Cold Water North Atlantic Gulf of Maine Lobster Tails wrapped in 24k Gold Edible Leafs, drizzled in vegan butter sauce..... sounds delightful. It is also served with 23K Gold Luxury Wine.  I believe that they will do great at this location. I wish them all the best with the success of their restaurant,",
