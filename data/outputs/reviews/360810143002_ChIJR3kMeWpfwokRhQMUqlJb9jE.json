Maybe I don't have enough appreciation for good food but I didn't think it was anything special.  And I thought it was expensive.  There was not a good selection of beer and wine.  The restaurant has a certain charm.  Everything is tiny and unique, a lot of character and a little bit ramshackle. It's definitely an experience.  My friend referred to the menu on the outside of the restaurant and he said that we shouldn't try to order from the menu because it hasn't been updated in years.  My friend asked about the price of an item and he scolded him, saying that this wasn't \"fast food\".  He tried to pressure us into ordering an appetizer.  And he was very funny and friendly but it felt a little forced.  There's a NYTimes review \"Pita With a Generous Helping of Quirkiness\" that's completely accurate.  We ended up order 3 beers, 1 wine, 2 chicken kebabs, and 1 appetizer sampler platter.  This was about twice as much food as we should have ordered.  The total $88.00 including tip.",

For the guy complaining about the price and there not being menus then you should of left when you found out there wasnt a menu or asked for a price when you asked what was available cause thats exactly what I did. No one forced any of you to go there and for the other complaint of the Owner charging you $5 to share a plate thats his policy. No one is forcing you guys to go to this establishment so why would you go there find out they didnt have menus and stay anyway and give the guy a bad rating for something you knew in the first place. Thats like going to McDonalds knowing they have hamburgers and giving them a bad rating because you dont like hamburgers.  Now to my experience. It was the best food I ever tasted my entire life. Like others said. There's No menu, its just whats available for the day and the Chef/Owner/Waiter tells you what he has. Ask for the price so you make sure you agree to it and not be like these fools on here ordering stuff not knowing how much it costs, lol. I ordered the Caramelized Rabbit and I forgot what my friend ordered and it was delicious. The Chef made plate with seasonings with it with ground up herbs, spices, and flowers from all over the world to make up the most tastiest thing I ever had my entire life. I was dipping my rabbit and pita bread in it and I litterally felt all my taste buds in heaven. I felt parts of my tongue that I never felt before. A sensation in my mouth that is beyond words.This was my experience and I get so angry hearing people talk bad about the owner. I love the vibe in there and he's friendly, even flirty, but hes innocent and having fun. He explained to me and my date exactly how he was going to prepare the meal and what he was going to do in it and hes a great conversationalist.  2 Dinners, an appetizer, and a tea ran me $55 after tip. Well worth it :) Best Experience I had",

When you enter the establishment, you are greeted by Ali, he is the owner, chef, and the only staff. There is no menu, but Ali will tell you what is available for the day. You can the meat or fish, and he will decide how he will cook and serve it. Their choices are not for the weak stomach so be prepared. Our dinner consisted of lamb cheeks, lamb thyroid, goat shank, and rabbit. All dishes were either sauteed or stewed in Egyptian spices. I would say this has got to be one of the most amazing Egyptian food I have ever tasted this side of the hemisphere and I definitely recommend.",

We decided to take to go after my boyfriend said no just that would be fine. After 20 minutes it was ready, he charged him $14 for it when the menu said $9. After he agreed he would just give one plate, Instead he still charged $5 more. Did not like it he didn't come to us when we entered yet for two white couples he went right to them and ask how they were and what he would recommend.

Owner/chef/waiter appears very friendly. No menu. Full of young diners. We had a couple of beers, 3 appetizers and a main dish. I was stunned to find out at the end that we owed $95!!! If there was a menu or any posted prices, we would have left. At half the price I would have considered it an experience. At $100 it was a total ripoff that left us with a bitter taste. Too bad - I was really looking forward eating there. PS by looking at the young coupes there, I can not believe that the same prices are charged for everyone.",

        "caption": "I recently tried out Kabab Cafe with a group of friends. To put it plainly, we had a blast. The place is tiny, but we managed to all squeeze into a corner. The decor is whimsical and homey. Chef Ali asked us what we felt like eating and made some recommendations. We began with the appetizer platter of hummous, falafel, and baba ganouj with a touch of Egyptian hocus-pocus, followed by roasted cauliflower in a pomegranate reduction and lamb \"cheeks\" with an egg stirred in. We also shared a melt-in-your-mouth lamb shank (shank you very much) with vegetables as well as chicken and vegetables and a broiled fish with citrus. The flavors were complex without being pretentious. Portions are large; we ended up spending about $25/person (which felt like a pretty good deal for 4 hours of eating) and left feeling stuffed and happy.   This is a unique restaurant--while Astoria is known for cheap (if not necessarily amazing) Middle Eastern food, Kabab Cafe is a bit pricey for everyday meals but an excellent value for a special occasion. It doesn't do takeout, has endless possibilities but no menu, and you can BYOB (bring your own water while you're at it--they only serve bottled water). The staff consists only of Ali and his helper, and he cooks right in the middle of the room so you can watch everything while engaging in lively banter. He'll talk to you about food, Egypt, politics, whatever, and corny jokes are par for the course. He plays an unconventional assortment of music from the Soggy Bottom Boys to Natacha Atlas. The bottom line: If you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience, this is it!",
