The waiter was very nice to us, and he even offered to take our picture for us. When we came down from the restaurant back to the group floor, the hotel lobby boy gave me his number, which was a little peculiar, but other than that, it was a very fun experience.

Customer service was spot on even though we thought the waiter was checking up on us too often but we know he's just doing his job. If I had to complain or find a fault it would be flavors.

None of the toppings were offered to me so I got a plain and dry waffle. I at the potatoes to fill me up.  I had higher expectations given the pictures in the elevator of the hotel of the food.

We did have a large group but the rest of the restaurant was pretty much empty, and we ended up spending 2.5 hours there.  To start, we had the buffalo wings (these were fine), and the guacamole. We tried to order two orders, but they said they only had enough for one order. That seemed odd to me, especially since they had avocado toast on the menu, but we still stuck with it. Out comes the guac, which was this unsightly, almost electric green color. It looked like they added food coloring to it, and if not, they definitely bought it premade (which would make sense when they said they ran out). Not surprisingly, it did not taste good.  For my entree, I went with the asparagus risotto (arborio rice, roasted asparagus, parmesan cheese) with chicken. No complaints here. The risotto was perfectly cheesy, and the chicken was cooked just right.  I would say come here for the views and maybe a drink, but you can skip the food.",
