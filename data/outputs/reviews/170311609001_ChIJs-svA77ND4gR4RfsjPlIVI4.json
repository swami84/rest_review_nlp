And now I'm paying all this money for some Pad Thai which really all it is are some noodles with sauce a little bit of meat... the portion is so small now and the quality isn't quite what it used to be. I can make far better Pad Thai at home.  I remember getting a free almond cookie way back in the day. This place used to be wonderful.

Additionally, they fed my friend (we always go here together) who is a strict vegetarian of 18-yrs chicken on his dish instead of tofu. It was a fried dish, so he didn't notice until he bit it.  Upon notifying them of their mistake, they demonstrated awful service. The waitress and cook spoke loudly to each other (not in English, so don't know what they were saying) and LAUGHING loudly about this. It's a very serious matter - feeding a vegetarian meat is akin to giving them instant food poisoning.  They remade the dish, he barely ate it (we didn't take it to go) and they still charged us full price for the entire meal. They were extremely rude and unapologetic -- and as a result, they've lost 2 regular customers.",

I swear that was about 50g of ham with BBQ sauce on top of white rice. It could not have been more than 2 thin ham slices , sliced in smaller squares to look more. I had a seaweed salad appetizer, there were more sliced cucumbers than seaweed and and one more entree and appetizer.  Seriously, for a Asian Restaurant your portions were smaller, but borderline normal. This time it was so ridiculous, I had to go out of my way to comment.  It's a shame Chang's Restaurant owners retired.",

The food has been consistently good and its reasonably priced and come in fairly large portions, its also BYOB. Very quick and very warm, friendly service.  Be warned, this a no frills sort of restaurant, the place is sparsely decorated and there is no real flare to the food presentation, but the flavor makes up for it . I've always been a fan of the rangoon, the fried tofu, the pad thai wth tofu, and the Panang!  So if you want to get some great tasting warm food in a casual everyday sort of way, then go here. But if you're looking to impress someone while out on a date, this place might definitely hurt your chances.",
