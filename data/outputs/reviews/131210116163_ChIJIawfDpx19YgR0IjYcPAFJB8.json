He never would give me another phone number to call and he was just plainly unhelpful or even concerned about my issue!

The service is exceptional because they're always willing to answer questions, give samples and are patient. However, I do have some suggestions. Along with the theme of healthy living, I think they should also implement some environment-healthy options for containers, utensils and straws. It just makes sense for a place like this to offer metal utensils for customers eating in and they can be washed and reused. Additionally, there can also be an option for paper straws, (balsa, i think ) wood utensils, and paper storage containers. I feel as if it might be a good and green change if they started reducing their unnecessary plastic usage.",

It really made a difference when every bite was equally coated in dressing. If you really enjoy salad as much as I do, this place is very much worth it.",
