Most people visit with a few people, but even if you drink alcohol, it doesn't cost 10,000 yen per person. You will be full for about 6000 yen. I have repeated it many times, but I am satisfied even if I take a gourmet person ^ ^ I don't speak Japanese very well, but I can make a reservation online and use a little English. I went to another famous steak shop, but I liked it. It is really recommended as it is located along the main street and can be walked.

Never had a complaint about their steaks or sides, and their waiting and bussing staff were professional, punctual, and considerate.  Unfortunately the quality of the previously mentioned has fallen off the other end of the spectrum.  Their current waiting staff doesn't seem to carry themselves to a higher standard compared to the previous dining experience at d.k.  Their waiting staff are more frequently tardy and don't care to check on your meal or tend to your dining needs. They also forget to bring out a lot of the things you ordered, but will remember to add it to the check.  The sides and main entrees sadly are not A+ worthy anymore, and their specialty dry aged steaks do not get a pass either.  Ten years ago there wasn't a doubt that your food would come out great; but now it's a gamble if it'll come out barely palatable, and they fail to hit the mark on your steak doneness.  It's sad to see an establishment like d.k Steak House have its \"glory days\".  I can only hope that I would be able to have a great meal comparable to those of past experiences, but I don't see that happening.  Because the last time I dined in was very unsatisfactory I don't see myself returning anytime soon.",

Crisp outside with a fluffy inside, with their house-made compound butter, which was delicious. Then we had the seared ahi tuna with truffle oil. Also good. No complaints so far. Then our main course came out. I had the 30 day dry aged bone in ribeye. Cooked to perfection. However, it was severely under-seasoned. To the point where I had to add salt from the table. For $72 dollars I was expecting a blast of flavor. The meat itself was very flavorful, due to the dry aging, but I was underwhelmed. The truffle mac'n'cheese was delicious as well. My wife had mashed potatoes, and a side of shrimp accompanying her steak. Both were extremely bland. The booths are uncomfortable and too far from the table. The wine list only describes the expensive wines, so you're ordering blindly if you choose a more inexpensive glass of wine.  Can't say I hated it, but I also don't think I'll return, or recommend to a friend. Ruth's Chris is better for around the same price.",

The salad was too vinegar and not very delicious. Cocktails were too sweet and did not taste good. The steak was perfect and very tasty. The truffle maccan cheese garnish was difficult to eat because the truffles were slightly salty. However, I enjoyed the main steak. Also, I gave out a birthday plate and it was a good memory. If the menu other than steak is more delicious, I want to come again, but it's subtle.

If you just sit down and wait, we can prepare your seat.\" After confirming the reservation confirmation e-mail, I made a mistake and booked the next day. The steak is a rare 30-year-old rib eye recommended by the waiter. It was served by rare properly. Of the center worm. It was boney and decky ($ 22 ounces $ 79), but I felt that it was such an edible part because the fat near the bone was so heavy that I couldn't eat it. He asked for a prime rib that was aged for 30 days in a special today at medium rare, but the waiter came back and this was only a medium, so it was medium. Here comes plenty of mashed potatoes and just the right boiled snap peas. It also had gravy sauce and Ario Orio. It's $ 62, so it's special! We had a piece of tasting, but it was moderately simple and I prefer this one. I thought in my mind that I would change it. Share a large Caesar salad ($ 10), 2 glasses of wine (5 ounces per glass) and 2 small bottles of Perrier ($ 6 x 2). Tipping 19% (18%, 19%, 22% recommended) In the middle because it was done.) Total payment $ 256.23 I can't say anything about meat because I like it, but I was fat. I would like to try the fillet the next time I go. The shop was casual and comfortable.

But the telephone reception was very pleasant and I made a reservation there. Aged meat and other flavors were unquestionable as expected.

The fillet mignon was tough, very tough. Like a top sirlion. The steamed vegies were good. Sad part was the $170 bill for two. Saddest part was the two spiders the waiter killed on the table and didn't even give any discount. For what this place is trying to be, I shouldn't have to ask for the discount.

That is why this Steakhouse gets a 5-star rating because they truly are five stars they got the whole triangle good customer service excellent decor excellent food and it was a very mentally sound please the food was grass-fed and from the island so the carbon import was less.

Better signage or website description of where in the hotel complex the restaurant would have been nice. It is located on the 3rd floor by the pool and shares a door with another restaurant.  As an appetizer we got teryaki chicken wings, they we're good very sweet and saucy.  For drinks we tried, lychee sangria, mui tai, mai tai and my own concoction of the foam from the mui tai on top of the lychee sangria. The lychee sangria was so good, slightly effervescent and refreshing. All the others were fine, nothing special.  We all got the dry aged steaks, they were delicious. For sides we got, potatoes au gratin, crispy brussel sprouts, onion rings and truffle mac and cheese. Potatoes were fine not as decadent as I would have hoped and there was a lot of rosemary flavor (I think). Sprouts were good, enjoyed the salty capers they came sprinkled with. Onion rings were nothing special. The Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious although I didn't notice any truffle flavor. But I don't have the most refined pallette so maybe it was me.  Dessert we ordered the macadamia nut cheesecake, mud pie and 2 Godiva cocktails. The drinks were good but not spectacular. The cheesecake looked beautiful but was tiny, smaller than the palm of my hand. And the bottom was a bit soggy. The mud pie was huge, definitely a sharing size. My boyfriend really liked it but I was not impressed. It was a giant slice of 2 flavors slightly bland ice cream topped with 2 types of sauce and some nuts. I would have liked more depth of flavor and some consistency in dessert sizes.  The service was good. We had a 5:30 reservation and we were seated right away. Our server was friendly and on top of things.",

I think that it is better to have a reservation as many people are already visiting for dinner in the evening. Also, because we visited in the evening, we can see the sunset scenery and feel the atmosphere very well. The meal was delicious not only for meat but also appetizers, soup and so on. (The price is also expensive accordingly.) However, air conditioning was effective inside the store, and the children were sorry for feeling cold a little. Also, I would like to visit.

He is a definite asset to your company and if we lived closer\ud83d\ude0a we would eat there all the time!!!!  Please let Cheng read this, as I told him I wanted to write him a review. It\u2019s taken me 2 months, but I didn\u2019t forget. There was a manager, maybe Sarah or Ivy and they were very nice. Everyone was. Thank you so much. Sherry and Ralph stegemoller.

Everywhere I go I like to try the Rib Eye as it is a base that I judge the quality of a restaurant on. I was able to try their 30 day dry-aged bone-in rib eye and it was superb! My wife had purchased the regular rib eye so that we could compare and there was a noticeable nuttier difference. The dry age process was really able to bring out a richer and fuller flavor profile within the meat. On top of that I had their Caesar salad (another base test of mine) and it was delicious. I was hoping for a \u201cfishier\u201d taste (personal preference) but it was still very good. All of that topped with some fresh bread and tasteful butter it was a great meal. We had gone there for our anniversary and even though we had declined when they asked about desert, they brought us  a high end panna cotta plate at no charge. Very thoughtful and thus a great server and staff. A solid location as well on the coast of Waikiki. It will definitely be a place we revisit and would suggest you do the same.",

I requested Chicago medium rare dry aged ribeye(this should have a solid char on the outside and red through out the center) what I Recieved was just a medium rare steak no char ... Barely even had grill marks. Thst being said the flavor was there but not how I ordered it. My girlfriend ordered a filet medium rare. This thing damn near had a heart beat still. Again barely even grill marks. At 56 and 45 dollars just for the steaks I feel a tad cheated and definitely wasn't waiting to have them recook our meals . On the plus side our waiter was excellent, drinks are amazing there as well as the appies. It's a shame that what we really went there to enjoy(a steak) fell flat. On this visit 3 star at best and only because of the waiter and appies. Won't be going back",

It came out almost as a medium rare steak with none of our special ordering. However Josh did offer another stake but we did not want to waste the food for wait. He did bring a dessert so he gets top stars and the management for trying to make it right. Just wish that they would have come out correctly because they are $56 just for the steak!",

Mostly Westerners, Japanese beginners do not come to the east side of Waikiki, so it's just a little bit good. I eat dry aged steak for 30 days every time. Really delicious. Moreover, the price is reasonable. This is not the case with others. If you have a set of appetizer and complete meal, I think that it is just right for a couple to share or it is enough for Oita (the size is difficult to convey in the photo) Appetizer Monster Shrimp Scampi is highly recommended. It was the best garlic shrimp in history. The garlic butter sauce is excellent. With the attached bucket, you will taste it to the end. The price has changed. As of February 2018, the price has increased by 3-5 dollars from the price of the menu on the net. It's still cheap though.

Combine that with a beautiful ocean view and our exceptional server Wes and we will definitely be recommending DK's as the must go to for Waikiki.",

The explanation was that the fattier cornfed beef works better for keeping moisture throughout the dry aging. The dry aging adds an interesting  flavor while also making the steak more tender. Nothing amazing as far as sides but the steak is a good value. Order the tempura ice cream for dessert (they'll bring it from the Sansei side). Lots of wine options. Great service.
