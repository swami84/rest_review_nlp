The menu is small but the drinks are decently priced. Its basically small bites and sandwiches. There's open bartop tables and a seated patio area. I saw a small area with cornhole boards and a few other items. There are also board games for people who sit inside. I gave it three stars because our server was horrible. I've been in the industry for years and her attentiveness needs some work. You should NEVER neglect one of your tables while deeply conversing with the one behind it. Maybe if we had a different server my experience would have been better. The food runner ended up being the highlight of my evening. He was super friendly every time he came out. I'll try again next time we are in town with a different server.",

What is really driving me to leave a review was the Kid's Quesadilla. Whoever made the kid's menu is obviously a parent. This was really a child sized portion of literally just cheese on a tortilla. We chose fries as her side, and to my surprise it came not only with fries but also with Goldfish crackers! In 2 years of ordering a kid's meal, this is the first time someone realized that kids don't care for finely seasoned sides and just want a handful of Goldfish. The atmosphere is definitely relaxing. Our waitress was amazingly attentive. I hear pre-covid that they have board games available to play at your table. There is also an awesome out door area with huge games to play like big connect4, ladder ball, corn hole, and scrabble. 10/10 will go again and again!",

The toppings were all clumped together so you had dry chips and then chips that were soggy. There was so much bbq sauce and it is so sweet that you couldn\u2019t taste anything else. We also ordered the baked goat cheese and it was ok but lacked any depth of flavor, again being overly sweet with nothing but honey, goat cheese, crasins and pecans.  My husband had one of the sandwiches and it was ok, again just nothing special. With so many amazing restaurants to choose from we likely won\u2019t choose Melt again unless the menu gets an overhaul and they develop some better flavors.",

He gave us dinner recommendations & went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable in the booth we were given. Excellent customer service. The food was delicious, as well! Would return if ever in Huntsville again:)",

We also ordered the Mac & Egg roll, which, along with my lemonade and our server, Brooklyn, was the only positive about the experience. My sandwich barely had any cheese to speak of and it was only moderately warm. The soup was edible but nothing I'd return for and almost any canned tomato soup would put it to shame, which is...a shame. My fiance's sandwich had a criminally tiny portion of sauerkraut but decent flavor. We enjoyed our appetizer, our server was attentive and warm, and I could drink gallons of the Lemonade, but all in all, this was a disappointing experience.",

The roll used for my sandwich was hard, and the sandwich itself generally lacked flavor. My wife was equally unsatisfied with her order as she did not care to finish.

The interior of the restaurant is modern sleek very inviting and table service was crisp and well intentioned My problem is with the food and presentation. Pacing was also problematic  All ordered items came to the table rapid fire before the salad was 1/3 completed. My partner had a veggie burger which was just ok but lacked taste with the bun becoming  mushy because of  condiments, lettuce and tomato.A. quick fix could be a toasted French baguette to solve that problem. I had the Ragin Cajun sandwich  which was good but suffered the same fate as the burger.Texas toast will be a mushy mess with coleslaw  roasted pork and condiments. Apparently the restaurant doesn't have a sandwich press which might solve this  problem. The mac and cheese appetizer was very good They use paper napkins which I loath..They use small clear glasses that requires the server to constantly refill.Too much back and forth. Not great for the landfills either. All in all OK and waiting to be GREAT!",

Its a spicy cajun style piece of grilled chicken served on toasted bread with coleslaw. The chicken was a little bit spicier than I anticipated but it was pleasantly offset by the fresh coleslaw topping. I thought using the toasted bread was a great choice since it gives the sandwich a good solid construction so you don't lose any of the coleslaw like you would on a roll or a bun.  The mac n cheese egg roll was delicious and it came with a sweet & spicy dipping sauce that was more spicy than sweet but it turned out to be a perfect compliment to the cajun sandwich.  The only thing i didn't love about this meal was the side of fries. They were a little bland and not crispy like you'd expect from beer battered fries.  All in all though, great meal, and I will definitely try more sandwiches in the future. Would love to see a Monte Cristo added to the menu as well!",

Melt started as a food truck, and was so wildly popular, they were able to get finding for a restaurant. That restaurant is great, and the menu is the same in Birmingham and Huntsville. The problem with the Birmingham restaurant is that it\u2019s too small.  The Huntsville restaurant is stylish and modern, well lit, with a fancy bar that can serve outside and inside. This is an improvement to the Birmingham restaurant, which was built on a much lower budget, and always has a line at lunch and dinner. This place is great and highly recommended.  The basic philosophy of the restaurant is built on the classic grilled cheese sandwich. Take that favorite and add various meats and other flavors. My personal favorite is the Flyin\u2019 Hawaiian, which is ham and pineapple. The sandwiches are all great, and the mac and cheese is also very good. They serve various beers that I am not qualified to evaluate.",

Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t blowed away for a $17 lunch.  My friend spent more than me. The location is awesome and atmosphere is nice but they definitely need to improve their sandwiches. Can\u2019t have a name like the melt & not have it loaded with melted cheese. The prices are too high for what you get. You can go to Edgars, get an awesome sandwich loaded with melted cheese, two sides, and a drink for $9-10.",
