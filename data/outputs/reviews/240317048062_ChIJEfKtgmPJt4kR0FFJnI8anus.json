I went with my girlfriend and best friend on Saturday Jan 2 at 9pm. The server informed us that the restaurant would be closing at 10pm sharp. No problem. We had one of the most amazing meals of our lives. We ordered the 2004 Les Forts de Latour with our steak and fish, the wine was an experience on its own and the food was absolutely amazing. It wasn't just the incredible food but the vibe from the restaurant was so homey and lovely. Chef Cam was the only one in the kitchen, every time we looked in his direction he was just smiling and having a lovely time making fantastic food. It's kind of hard to describe how great of a time we had here in such a short time but I highly recommend coming in for yourself.  We will absolutely be back and hopefully be able to enjoy the restaurant and ambiance after the COVID restrictions are lifted. After leaving the restaurant, I spent the next few hours reading about our wine and the history behind it. I also had no idea Chef Cam was a world renowned chef, pretty amazing, we just looked at nice food in Bethesda and picked this restaurant based on the reviews. We are looking to bringing our friends to Bistro Province soon!  Cheers",

When we asked for bread, they said jokingly: \" Our baker went out of business, so we don't have any. Next time bring your own bread\". We really thought the server was joking, but, apparently, not. Then we asked for a cocktail menu. They said they didn't have a menu, but could make anything we wished. The server made good suggestions. Then he came back with a drink in a martini glass and extra in a regular glass saying that he didn't measure it right, so \"here you are\". We were pleased of course. At the end we have received a check for $100 for 4 drinks. We asked why we were charged $25 a drink, and the server said that he charged us for \"extra\" that he gave us. We said that we didn't really ask for \"extra\", but he said \"It is what it is. You gotta pay since you drank it\". We were really displeased with the situation, we paid, but would not go back.",

Instead, there was a rib eye steak for $58, a price that my wife and I were not willing to pay no matter how great that steak could have been. The soup was ok but a little watery, the salads and the main courses were not special, and the apple tarte tatin was caramelized to a point that it tasted bitter.  The cappuccino came cold and after sending it back they made a new one that was below par. Once you start to have a disappointment, other things such as the silverware that needs an upgrade starts to stand out. Overall, definitely not over a 4 star experience. We received a quick response from the restaurant where they think we were disappointed with not finding steak and fritz in the menu. They completely missed the point that there food was mediocre and what they are charging on some of the items is unreasonable. More importantly, they caused us to start the night on a down mood.  Not sure how the others gave such high rating!",

The staff were very professional and attentive. Some of the menu was in French (very fun) and the staff took the time to help us understand everything. A great touch! The food was incredible and just the right amount. Personally, I had the lobster purse, scallops, and apple tarte. They were all divine! I also got to try my friend's risotto, which was also amazing. The wine was perfectly flowing and delicious.  The private space is wonderfully sized and has its own bathroom. Everyone raved about the meal and how much fun they had. We wouldn't have had it any other way.  I simply cannot say enough good things about the service, food, and overall ease of planning the event! I had zero worries and as an event planner, that is an essential feeling to have :)  Much love to all who read this, Kayla",

The duck came with a terrine of foie gras which was mainly terrine and a micro speck of foie gras. The duck was cooked perfectly but had no flavor. The lemon torte would have been amazing but a splash of amaretto drowned out the subtlety of the lemon. Why, oh why? And everything was just so very slow.

First , I did not  feel the French atmosphere at all, more like a Mexican restaurant. I didn\u2019t like the food, this is not a French cuisine and overpriced for what you are getting. I made a reservation through the manager on the phone for a private room table for 2 , once we got there I was told by the staff, after staff spoke with the manager to confirm my reservation , that there is no table for 2 people in the private rooms section. The manager did not even come down to tell us, she had to tell the staff over the phone while we were waiting downstairs. Meanwhile , she was upstairs in the private rooms section . We decided to stay downstairs and cope with the noise. About 45 mins , the manager came downstairs and being hypocritical , she told us how sorry she was, keep apologizing and asked us if we wanted to move now, we told her No because we were not willing to move after we were already sitting ,  started drinking and ordered our food which by the way was tasteless when we got it. I\u2019m sure she gave our table to some other guests or she didn\u2019t have a table at all but still accepted my reservation, ridiculous. Staff are not friendly, all seem scared, cold and confused . This is Not a French restaurant , I have been to couple of them and I can tell the difference specially the Food, again it is more like a Mexican cuisine with a French name attached to it and overpriced . If you want a good French restaurant go to - le vieux Logis restaurant in Bethesda , you will have the best French cuisine , staff over there are very professional , very welcoming and again you will have a  great, Real french food. I should have gone there again but I thought I should try this restaurant for the first time and I was highly disappointed .",

We chuckled when the waiter mentioned that everything was cooked to order and that there are no warming trays in the kitchen so the service might seem slower than we're used to. It never seemed slow to us but we had planned to linger and the pace of serving each course felt just right. The food came out in perfect portions with beautiful presentation and each bite was better than the last from the first course to the last. We will certainly be back.",

My only complaint was the mimosa was $14 but the price wasn\u2019t on the menu. That\u2019s too much given the main course was $12. I feel like this place struggles financially and isn\u2019t the most popular because of its location, and I want people to know that it is a friendly, delicious, local gem worth going out of your way for.",

My veal chop was perfectly savory and tender, and his diver scallops were melt in your mouth delicious. The lobster purses were sublime. Endive salad was delicate yet distinctive with a lovely, light Roquefort dressing  - very refreshing. Desserts - the nougat and chocolate mousse parfait were fab. Shocked to find this exquisite gem in our own back yard. We've had too many average meals at too many restaurants in the area for ridiculous prices. We are happy to pay for quality. The prices here - for such high quality food - are a great value. We will definitely be back to Bistro Provence (again and again)!! Chef Cam is a true artist/chef.",

For the entr\u00e9es, my date had one of the seafood special, which consisted of scallop clam and lobster (called the Branzini), and I had the meat special, which was a giant 16 ounce veal chop. The seafood and veal were so fresh and I was pleasantly surprised they tasted so good on a Sunday evening. We had a glass of wine each (the Sancerre and the fruity Cote du Rhone Red.) The dessert (we picked the cherry one called the \"Amaretto Parfait\") was delicious and a fantastic way to close our dinner night. My date is a big seafood and cherry person and she absolutely loved it. It was pricey but everything was cooked very well and the staff took good care of us. It was my second time going there (the first time was a work related lunch) and I will be going back. It was nice to exchange a few words in French with the chef himself. Merci beaucoup!",

        "caption": "I went here as my last meal in Bethesda when I moved as I hadn't been yet and figured that I should try to end on a high note by going to what had been regarded to me as the best restaurant in Bethesda. Of course I was wary, having been told that before, when I'd first moved there with places like Black's that ended up being completely abhorrent, so I reserved my judgement. Bistro Provence fully lived up to, and even exceeded my expectation - it is the best restaurant in Bethesda. Our food was simply unbelievable, from the salmon tartar topped with the most exquisite caviar imaginable (for someone who has not acquired a caviar taste to say that speaks volumes), to the veal chop that was sized for Fred Flintstone but cooked for Fred Astaire (the size was just a nice bonus, I wasn't expecting what I got). The Bordeaux was amazing, full-bodied, and not overpriced; it needed a few minutes to open up and I'm so glad that I didn't send it back because it was completely worth the wait and risk. We finished with a lava cake that was prepared to perfection and accompanied by the smoothest deliciously subtle ice cream to clean the palate; of course I needed a cognac to accompany it, and given the damage that I'd already incurred on my wallet, opted for the house cognac - what a great choice it ended up to be. Bistro Provence has tied Cafe Renaissance (Vienna) for my favorite restaurant in the D.C. area.  These bad reviews are completely unfounded, it's possible that I just got lucky on a good night but I really don't think so. It seems like the tastes of these individuals are quite elementary, and I don't think that they realize that the staff in a restaurant like this are probably better educated and more worldly than they are; not having patience for people who won't (actually, can't) fully appreciate the experience. Paris would tear these people to shreds.",

The service is untrained and they really do not know what they are doing, to the point of lacking manners some times and not understanding very simple rules of the service industry (e.g. like not taking the dish out of your hands when you asked them not to do that.... and they still keep pulling). The oversize plates (not the food, the actual dishes themselves) made it quite uncomfortable to even place everything on the table for 7 people that we were in. On top of that, they tried to rearrange the table every single time they brought a new dish.....like 5 times at least, which was very annoying. Forgetting the service, the bathroom wasn't appropriate for this kind of place, not clean and in a horrible location. We were of course expecting at least that the food would be good to compensate for all the bad stuff. Not at all. Mediocre at best, and very much not French cuisine anyways. Definitely not worth the price by far. A very disappointing experience and waste of money. When you go to a place like this and pay those prices, this is simply intolerable.",

        "caption": "The wait staff was untrained at best, but was closer to being out right bad. They tried, multiple times, to refill our wine glasses, which had wine in them, with water. They didn't get us various things we asked for until the 2nd or 3rd request. The service was also quite slow. They also misstated the price on the wine as $50 but was actually $130, which we found out when we got the bill.  To add to that, the food was mediocre and I felt I would have gotten a better tasting meal at Chipotle.  To get to the bathroom, I either had to take a filthy staircase down or ride the elevator which smelled like trash.  We spent nearly $600 that night for 5 people for food, drinks and tip. I expected a lot more for this kind of money. McDonalds has higher standards than this place. This is one of those restaurants that's all about the name and being able to tell people you went there, rather than serving high quality, tasty food with competent wait staff. Its a shame considering all the hype surrounding it.",

We sat - as did everyone else - for 2.5 hours before being served main meal.  Arrived at 6:30 and left after 10 without desert or coffee. Really weird staff and managers acting like wait was typical.  No table turnovers all night. Staff pushed specials that turned out nearly twice the cost of average meal - never mentioning price when we asked for recommendations, so bill was a shock.  Ouch.",

The decor is pleasant enough, especially the patio, which was closed because of rain, but inside the tables are far too close together and the noise level requires shouting. At a recent visit, the service was amateur/pretentious and the waiter's manner was disdainful: e.g. when I asked if any of the wines by the glass was a Chardonnay, since none of the four whites was labeled as such, the waiter snottily said, \"yes, the Chardonnay,\" as if I was an idiot for not knowing that the Sancerre was a Chardonnay. The waiter was awful (no knowledge of the cost of the many specials, more numerous than items on the menu, for example), and, to paraphrase the joke about the bad food, there was not enough of him: since he was serving at least 20 people, waits were long between his invariably unpleasant appearances. Near the end of the meal, as the four of us were reminiscing about movies, he snarkily said, \"Now it's time for movie trivia, eh?\" At least he didn't start the evening with \"Hi, My name is X, I'll be your server tonight.\" Otherwise, the service was more suited to a diner than an expensive bistro.",
