Crab Rangoon missing crab.  sweet and sour sauce  is so watered down.    Meat items are fatty pieces.  Its so sad.  Seems they want to cut corners in everything.

However, I LOVE the food. I really do. I am a vegetarian so I always get vegetable dishes. The vegetables a crisp and not over cooked. The sauce is so flavorful and delicious. I find that most chinese restaurants cook the hell out of their food until it's soggy, then put it in some soy/ cornstarch/ water mix and call it a meal. Dragon Express may look scary but you should totally give it a shot. ( and there's an awesome martial arts place right next door so you can go kick all those calorie's asses right after . )",
