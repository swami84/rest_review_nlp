A side from that, I arrived at the restaurant in about 30min but my Order wasn\u2019t ready and at that point was when they started to prepare it, mind you I was given an estimate that my order would be ready in about 23min and it took them about 40min to prepare it, I was there waiting and watching other customers who came after me with larger orders receiving theirs while I just patiently waited, unacceptable. To make matters worse the staffs customers service was the worse I\u2019ve ever seen, it\u2019ll be an understatement to call it awful or horrendous. No one even bothered to apologize or acknowledge what just happened. For these reasons honestly speaking I will never go back to that specific restaurant again. I have also informed my family and friends of this ordeal and they were also deeply disgusted and will never step foot in that establishment. It is extremely sad that this occurred because I love wing stop and have never had anything bad to say until now, my only hope is that someone from upper management reads this and rectifies these issues so other future customers could have a way better experience than I did.",
