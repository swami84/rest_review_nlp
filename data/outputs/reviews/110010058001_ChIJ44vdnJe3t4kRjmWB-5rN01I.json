It may not be much to look at and some of the decor and furnishing may be a bit out of date but it is a nice warm spot to grab a beer or glass of wine.  We decided to order up some corn bread and what a unique presentation. Reality absolutely superceded our expectations when we were presented with a slice of bread which was perfectly soft and crispy, adequelately sweet, and paired with a portion of cranberry sauce and smoked ham. Very satisfying!  And oh by the way,  the corn bread as well as our drinks came out moments after we ordered  Once I saw this bar was rated so low on here I realized I needed to share our experience. Great work Avenue Grill!",

Prices vs. Portion: salads very good. Sandwiches a little below expectations  Food quality: excellent but again limited menu hurts overall review.

Only 10 minutes after I asked where our food was to a random employee did a cook bring our food out hot and fresh. Don't bother, I'm making this review while sitting at the table and the employees are yelling about a customer right behind me.  Edit: After voicing my concerns with the manager, I will amend this to 2 stars, we were asked if we would like dessert but we had to leave in order to catch a train. The manager was honestly shocked about mostly everything except the food. Hopefully the dining experience improves in the near future.",
