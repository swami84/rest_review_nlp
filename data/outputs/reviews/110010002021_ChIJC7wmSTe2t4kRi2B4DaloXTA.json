I\u2019m guessing they hadn\u2019t even started my pizza yet (I\u2019ve worked in the food industry before, and know how long it takes), and instead of simply communicating that with me so I could cancel the order, the worker disappeared to the back and had me wait 10 minutes past the scheduled order time for a half baked pizza. If you\u2019re going to give a customer a product late, it should at least be cooked all the way through, and not just hot cheese on unbaked dough. Won\u2019t be back and will stick with the Ledo\u2019s in Alexandria.",

A waste of our money. We ordered a large pizza with the garlic sauce( red sauce on the side), onions , green peppers mushrooms, jalape\u00f1o peppers on 1/2. An 18 pieces of fried wings. 6/ fried hard the rest the usual fry. Sauce on the side. They couldn\u2019t separate the chicken my husband was told( even when he told them to charge what you wish, we just wanted some fried hard) no doing it, then the one thing we wanted was the garlic sauce + extra on the pizza. Try no sauce on the pizza at all. So disappointed because the pizza is the Go To there, not the wings. We found this unfortunate piece of info when we bit into it at home, called the location on Wisconsin Avenue and the young lady wasn\u2019t helpful but just said the next time they will get the Oder right. I don\u2019t know about you but next time isn\u2019t helpful at the moment , after you\u2019ve paid for a particular item. You simply want what you pay for not ,We Will Get It Right The Next Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There is No next time for delivery or carry out. I wouldn\u2019t go to this restaurant ever again!!!",

Pizza movers was my go to delivery place down the road and I\u2019ve been into the pizza movers location and they had great service. My only complaint was with the limited menu and it seemed like the restaurant crew was being stifled by the owners constraints. Fairly recently, the food at pizza movers went south suddenly. After that, I ordered ledo and it was the best I had ever had. Have been ordering more in more. Last week I was picking up food from casbah (med food neighbor owned by same owners as ledo) and I saw a pizza movers manager in ledo! I suspect ledo got some good people from pizza movers to help give them a boost. Anyway, I love ledo and casbah. It\u2019s rare to have places in this area that deliver themselves vs outsourcing to 3rd party delivery, and it\u2019s great. Food is delivered timely and hot. The pizza is personally not really my style, but everything else is comforting and good quality- salads, sandwiches, mozzarella sticks, pasta, etc. I\u2019m about to try the baked Mac and cheese! Good job.",

We did not need two pizzas so the Manager got really angry and rude because he said he made the pizza and we must purchase it.  In addition, the french fries that were also ordered were burnt, dry, and nasty.  He doesn't know how to talk to people and totally disrespected my kids.

We received our food and the first container opened had two hairs in it. My boyfriend was hungry and we had paid for it so he decided to eat the sandwich anyway, as the hair was just on the inside of the container. After getting 1/4 of the way through the sandwich, he found two more hairs in it!  I called to complain and the manager told me that there was nobody in the restaurant with shorter dark hair so it couldn't have come from them.  When I pointed out that there was no other way it could have gotten inside the container and food, she told me that if I wanted a refund I would have to bring everything in just the way it came, uneaten.  I tried to ask her how I could do that when he found the hair while eating the sandwich and she hung up on me.  My boyfriend called back to speak to her and she called him a liar on the phone but agreed to replace the sandwich.  While he was on the phone with her we checked the other food and my sandwich also had a hair in it!  She still refused to believe us because \"the kitchen staff wears hair nets\" and at that point we no longer wanted replacement sandwiches since we were too disgusted.  Finally she agreed to give us money back for the subs only just because she \"didn't feel like dealing with this.\"  All around disgusting and incredibly rude.  Hard to say if the problem is the restaurant or just the manager (Christine), but either way we will be ordering elsewhere in the future.",
