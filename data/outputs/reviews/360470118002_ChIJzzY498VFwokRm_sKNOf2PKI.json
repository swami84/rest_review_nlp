Its funny because we made a reservation to dine on the roof top, there was no one, most customer were dining on the curbside. The Host guided us  up stair because we wanted the roof. No one serve you so, the way to order is through the smartphone, once it ready, they will call you and you go down stair to pickup, foods were all pack in a takeout bag. you just bring it back up stair to the roof and eat. It's not bad, just no one serve you. DON'T Order the Mango Souffle pancake , because it taste like PLASTIC.",
