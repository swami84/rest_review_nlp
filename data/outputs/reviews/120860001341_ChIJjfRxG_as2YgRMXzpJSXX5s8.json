They have a lot of variety of ingredients that you can choose, many vegetables, different fish such as salmon and tuna among others, fruits, sauces and crunchy. The truth very complete and, as I said, super varied, excellent to play a little with the palate and liven up every day to a new taste. It should be noted that everything is super cool. I think if I had to mark something negative would be that for me taste is a little expensive, but the rest everything perfect.  (Original) Muy bueno!
