When I arrived there with my friends, there was no hostess by the door, so we decided to sit by ourselves. We were 3 people waiting for more 2, so we chose a big table. A waiter came to us asking if we were having dinner, we said yes. After about 20 minutes waiting, the manager came to us asking again if we were having dinner. I said : yes! We are! Can we finally order ? Then he said that we couldn\u2019t sit there because that table was for 7 people. IThe problem is that at that time there were no more available tables in the restaurant any more! He stared at me and my friends and didn\u2019t give us any option. It was so rude and I felt so uncomfortable that I immediately left the restaurant . I don\u2019t recommend this place.",

May I say that the food could have been enjoyed more if the chairs weren't terribly uncomfortable? Limited menu. Some entrees have accompanying potato or vegetable, others only have the plain protein.  We even ordered dessert which varied widely from the way it was described. Mine was supposed to be raspberry sorbet. It came with 3 tiny scoops of sorbet - none raspberry, and 4-5 pieces of gummy previously frozen fruit! Ugh. Won't be back.",

Waitstaff very friendly, a little pressed due to big holiday crowd, but checked on us etc.  Drinks great.  We ordered the special Thxgvg Dinner option.  Soup fantastic.  Dinner served 'home style' > bowls, baskets & platter of turkey dinner items brought to table !  Really felt more 'homey', like our own family dinner. Absolutely everything was just great !  Straightforward good tasty traditional food.  Gravy great too.  Dessert table insane; you go pick.  Great choices. Coffee good too. Expensive but worth it !!  We will go back again. PS, Very family friendly. Liked seeing cute kids around. Also liked seeing customer diversity. / Clean restroom. \ud83d\ude09",

Arrived and the host was not at the stand so it took them a minute to seat us which was fine.. The server was very courteous and took our order fairly quickly. That's about where the high point of the experience ends. It took them nearly 45 minutes to bring us our food: clam chowder, loaded tots, breakfast sandwich, and lobster benedict. Server and another attendant brought out EVERYTHING at once and had the gall to bring us two bowls of clam chowder that very evidently had been sitting in the cold for way too long. The soup had a thick crust on top of it exactly like when you leave a sauce or soup sitting around for a few moments - unsurprisngly it was lukewarm on the cusp of cold. The tots were actually not bad but again, not very warm. My lobster hollandaise which was a $20 entree was actually cold to the touch so the sauce, eggs, and butter on the lobster were basically inedible. Initially I thought this was the error of the kitchen because our server was so nice - then I took a look around the place which to be clear, was not busy due to the snowmageddon situation, and eventually concluded that everyone was given their food in a timely professional fashion while our server clearly just did not do the service properly. My expectations at hotel restaurants generally aren't high but even at a dumpy diner I have never had someone hand me a bowl of soup with a crust on top of it. I politely told our server that our food was cold and truth be told, I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for them to redo our order to they \"generously\" took 20% off our ticket, it should be noted that our server mentioned this us and a manager did not come to check on us at any point. The whole time we were dining we then were privileged enough to watch their bartender very loudly try and give astrophysics lessons to a poor older couple seated at the bar while the 2 or 3 servers, including ours, stood next to him chit chatting. I'd extend my complaints to the food but to be frank, the food was so cold and gross that I can't tell if the food was bad or if the temperature just made it terrible.",

I'm a tater tots FIEND; I really enjoyed the first few bites of these, but I quickly tired of the sweet potato flavor. If you're really into sweet potato, though, you'll probably love these.  We enjoyed our entrees: house-made cavatelli for me and the daily seafood special for Joel (in this case, it was salmon with pomegranate seeds and other tasty things). We were given free desserts (they saw us taking photos of the food and said they wanted to give us something really beautiful for photos). We appreciated the gesture, but we were so painfully full already that we didn't really enjoy them. The chocolate fudge cake was HUGE, reminiscent of the \"Great Wall of Chocolate\" at PF Chang's.",
