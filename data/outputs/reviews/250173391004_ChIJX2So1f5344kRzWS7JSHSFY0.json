She came back to me EXTREMELY uncomfortable and upset about an experience she encountered with the cashier. He pretty much tried to sweet talk her and flirt with her in an unfriendly manor which I am sure no one wants to experience. I would highly consider properly training this younger guy on some manors or just remove him completely from the store.  The owner is a very friendly older gentlemen who without a doubt is the reason why this place is so highly reviewed and it would\u2019ve been a 5 stars from me if this young chap hadn\u2019t tried to flirt with the customers.",
