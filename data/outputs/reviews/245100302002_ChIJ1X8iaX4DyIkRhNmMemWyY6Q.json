Once I was seen, the whole occasion turned around. The server was very courteous. I had a lunch portion and a small salad. The bread crisp on top of the Ceasar salad was great. It gave a little extra crunch to the salad. The pasta was delicious and the service once seated was on spot!",

The service was great, the waitress was very knowledgable and happy to answer any, and all questions we had. All of the food we had was very good. I highly recommend the meatballs and calamari as appetizers, and the tortellini as a main dish. The tuna was also cooked to perfection and was delicious.  Pictured are: Tortellini - prosciutto filled pasta, sicilian pistachi cream sauce Braised duck Ragu - tagliatelle, parmigiano, gremolata Lobster ravioli - mascarpone, lemon, lobster cream sauce Calamari - fregola sarda, olives, capers, line nuts, golden raisins, calabrian chili Polpette meatballs - classic tagliata meatballs, tomato sauce, whipped ricotta, basil",

I completely understand they are operating under the mayor's guidelines during COVID, but being asked multiple times by multiple different people if we are ready to get a box for our food when we are in the midst of taking a bite is not a fine dining experience. Nowhere in the restaurant or on any booking sites for reservations do they mention this time limit, yet they mention the dress code multiple times inside the restaurant and on sites like OpenTable, their own website, etc. They say they are business casual yet the waiters and hostess' are in light wash jeans. I grew up with homemade Italian food for dinner constantly and this food was painfully average. The meatballs were over cooked, not tender at all, and cold. The bruschetta, bread and butter were over salted. I will never go back. Ambiance was incredible but they sat people so close to you. Why follow some COVID guidelines but not all? Also way overpriced for the average food.",

I had a certain level of skepticism as we approached the complex that was piping Italian American standards to the street...  We sat and ordered two cocktails. I had the Belzoni and was pleasantly impressed with the gratifying taste of a wonderful blend of rye with two Amaros of which I as unfamiliar, and just a touch of smoothing honey.  I will be picking up a bottle of at least one of the amaros for my own bar. G had a wonderful concoction of tequila, mezcal and hints of chili, and beamed at the first taste.  The fluffy bread was served with whipped butter and bits of perfect Parmesan cheese. Seems like it should be basic, yet I can\u2019t recall receiving the trio elsewhere.  We split a Cesar salad and G commented on the amazing dressing, then promptly ordered a glass of Prosecco in anticipation of the forthcoming house-made pasta.  Her lobster Fra. Diavolo was divine. An appropriately sized half-order with chunks of meat and spicy sauce that paired nicely with the bubbles.  I enjoyed a scrumptious marrying of blue crab and sea urchin cream sauce in the squid ink campanelle. I almost regretted not expanding to the full order (Covid weight).  We couldn\u2019t resist trying the trio of house-made gelatos with tea and coffee, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.  I hadn\u2019t realized they are an Italian chophouse, with an adventurous chef that is as proud of his cuts as he is with the pasta.  We can\u2019t wait for dinner!",

By the time I got a new dish, the rest of my party finished their meals and were ready for the check. It\u2019s not like the place was extremely busy either. I don\u2019t like to leave bad reviews, however it\u2019s best to warn anyone reading this to keep your expectations low.

And the day quora tagliata is grossly overrated and it needs to be taken care of immediately. The wicker chairs inside unacceptable the mirror that's it behind my wife was filthy the drapes that separated the rooms were filthy. To Alex Smith I'm quite sure you demand better and for our hard-earned money we expect better. It's needs to be taken care of because the dacor does not match or even come close to living up to the service and the food I can honestly say when we were sitting there eating and looking at the dacor and seeing the curtains we lost our appetite. We expect better and mr. Smith I'm quite sure you demand better for your restaurants we've been to the loch bar several times. We frequently disco Pizza and we've been to Ouzo Bay to which the decor and ambiance and service was excellent we did not agree with the food. But that's okay. We expect more from tagliata.",

I was with a large  group from work, one of my co-workers recommended that we should go here with an out of town client, so I did not want to make a scene and it back.  This was hands down the worst meal I have ever had in a Baltimore restaurant in 32 years.  Possibly, this was an exception, but I will never go back here again.

Their pasta is hand made, thus eating a half bowl appeared to be a very satisfying and light entree. Simply, their attention to detail in their food preparation as well as alcohol was exquisite. They successfully turned our last Sunday meal for the year into a memorable experience. In regards to customer service, our waitress was amazing.She was attentive, offered accurate descriptions of the food, and most importantly created a relaxed atmosphere. We were a party of 4 plus our 5 month old. Our baby was well behaved (no outburst, nor destructive behavior), which I noticed some staff were surprised. However,  not one staff member exhibit any words and physical expressions that caused our party to feel uncomfortable.",

We had a charcuterie board which was fantastic, I highly recommend the prosciutto. For dinner I had the squid ink pasta dish which was absolutely fantastic and generous on the crab meat. My boyfriend have the Bolognese which he said was a little bit dry but fixed up well with the addition of some olive oil. We had gelato and cake for dessert.

Tonight they had burrata with acorn squash, a little on the sweet side but really tasty, they also had a foie gras and rabbit terrine with a garlicky mustard.  Perhaps the best entree is the lobster ravioli (we always order this) so we had that plus the rabbit confit and stufato.  The only miss was the rabbit tortellini which was nothing special and I would not recommend that dish.  The wine list is like a small novel!  Had to get help ordering wine...there were thousands to choose from.  We enjoyed the bottle of aglianico recommended.  Desserts are always superb, we had gelato/sorbeto, tiramisu and the dark chocolate fudge cake.  Can\u2019t go wrong at Tagliata - great food, wine and attentive service.",

The main courses we ordered were both half pastas and were very good. The appetizers, however, were a terrible first impression. The meatball appetizer was just okay, but nothing special. The meat was a little salty and fatty and the sauce was just fine. The fried chicken appetizer was actually so bad we sent it back. It was coated in salt. I have had pretzels with less salt. It was a huge disappointment because the chicken looked like it could be good. Overall, the it was an okay experience, but for the price of the meal there are many better restaurants in Baltimore.",

I had the meatballs as an app. They weren't bad, but at an ITALIAN restaurant, I was expecting them to be delicious. My main course was the house made pasta w mushrooms. It was not good. It tasted very boring and bland, like they had thrown just  some plain butter on top (for $36). Drinks were okay, and service was eh. Oh, and staff wore everything from casual jeans to incredibly inappropriate, ill-fitting attire. Conclusion: Overpriced menu for the quality of food. Will not be returning.",

We shared a few of the small plates and a charcuterie board and everything was great. We particularly enjoyed the Tuscan fried chicken and the Rigatoni alla vodka. One of my aunts also got the squid ink pasta and loved it (she said it was nearly as good as the version she had in Italy a few months ago). The atmosphere is lovely, with live piano music in the bar and soft lighting. We'll definitely be back and I would highly recommend for a date night!",

While the dress code is displayed in the restaurant and on the website, I overlooked the no camouflage bullet -- no problem, except that there was a patron sitting in plain view of the two female hostess and any potential patron breaking several of the \"mandatory dress codes\" such as no hooded sweatshirts or sneakers. When brought to the hostesses attention all we got was a simple, \"I see what you mean\". When you allow certain patrons to blatantly violate the dress code and strictly enforce it with others, this becomes a discriminatory act. And to top it off, have said patron front and center to remind the ones you \"CHOOSE\" to turn away that the rules only apply to who you deem them suitable for is disrespectful and highly questionable.  It was a shameful and embarrassing experience to be turned away from an establishment that has proven they want to cater to a specific demographic who can come in sporting hooded sweatshirts and Vans. There's no other explanation other than the obvious. Stay away!",

I happen to have a vertical ID from Virginia because I recently moved to Baltimore and my vertical ID doesn't expire until 2021 so I haven't switched it out yet. They refused my service after initially accepting my ID stating for Valentine's Day only they aren't accepting vertical id's because there are authorities checking to make sure businesses aren't serving underage people. It completely ruined our night and I blame Atlas Restaurant Group as owners because it happened at The Elk Room as well. And the reasoning behind not accepting my id at each place was different which is very concerning.",

Used the valet, which is appropriately priced at $9. Seated very promptly with our 7:15 reservation. The place was packed, but was still able to talk to each other without yelling over the crowd. The interior is very comfortable and warm with interesting wood tones. The waiter promptly came to our table but gave us enough space to order without feeling pushy. His recommendations were scripted, he literally suggested all of the menu items and emphasized having charcuterie, app, pasta, steak. I don't know any couples that would order that much food. Cocktails were well made. Charcuterie is worth the trip alone. The meatballs were delicious. We had Bolognese (waiter said was the best he ever had) and Tortellini. Both pastas were bad. Bolognese noodles were dry and meat was gamy. The tortellini was too heavy on bacon.  Overall a great experience and would return to try the steak.",

This group of restaurants teamed up their sister places The Elk Room and Italian Disco with Tagliata for a night of great food, excellent drinks and three types of entertainment. Piano Bar sing-a-long at Tagliata\u2019s, 3-piece Jazz trio at The Elk Room and a DJ at Italian Disco. We party-hopped, ate, drank, danced and sang until the party was over at 3am!! That was a big deal for my friends and I being in our mid-40\u2019s. We can only stay out that late when we\u2019re having fun and we were, all night long! It was worth every penny of the ticket price and fees. We hope this party happens again next year but in the meantime, we plan on coming back throughout the year to all 3 places. Thank you for a great time!!",

The food was really great, and we are tough sells.  We started by splitting a carrot salad with fresh ricotta, which was fantastic.  The kitchen sent out a complimentary taste of their mushroom risotto next which was amazing...an umami masterpiece.  Then for our main course my wife had the squid ink pasta and shared one piece with me.  We were really blown away by the complexity and depth of flavor in this dish.  I had a full portion of the bolognese which was HUGE and very good!  I have left overs for lunch today.  We finished by splitting the dark chocolate cake which came with a complimentary trio of gelati.  Everything we had last night met or surpassed our expectations!  Service was great, prices reasonable for the amount of food we received, and flavors all on point.  We will definitely be back!",

First, I had been looking for weeks for reservations on OpenTable and it literally shows every Friday and Saturday night booked for the foreseeable future. We were catching a movie in Harbor East and upon seeing that Tagliata again had no reservations, we walked in at 645 on Friday night hoping to snag a seat at the bar, only to find a mostly empty restaurant and the hostess was able to seat us at a table. A nice surprise, but either something is not right with their settings in OT or they are intentionally trying to keep up an air that they are always booked, which is fine, but not a great strategy for getting in local folks who have to plan ahead.  That said, the place is exceptionally beautiful and felt like we were not in Baltimore. Very sleek, upscale vibes, and a combination of comfortable chair and booth seating. The service was spotty. The hostess didn't offer to take my coat, and our server forgot my date's drink order. Support staff (bread / cheese, bussers, runners) were all spot on.  The menu was interesting without trying too hard and I really appreciated that there were some great, high end wines offered by the glass, price not withstanding (although most of the list was very reasonable). I had a bruschetta which was delicious and my date the tortellini soup (also great), but his main dish is where Tagliata lost us. We paid $56 for a lobster ravioli that was practically raw. I love an al dente pasta, but for $60 it better be damn perfect and it wasn't even close. Flavor was good but was ruined by the doughy, raw texture. My beef tortellini was really delicious and the half portion was generous.  It was overall a decent experience, but if you are going to charge $50+ per plate, everything better be perfect, and Tagliata fell short.",

Hubs got the pasta bolignese  and he was very happy with his dinner. I got the half order of the lobster ravioli and it was the best thing that I have had to eat in a very long time. That being said, $26 for six ravioli is a little too steep of a price for me.  I did notice servers walking by as they were serving food, and the food servings seems to be a little small to me. It is a great place to go for dinner, but don't be surprise if you leave hungry.  Flavors of the food were absolutely delicious, but the price is just way too expensive for what you get.",
