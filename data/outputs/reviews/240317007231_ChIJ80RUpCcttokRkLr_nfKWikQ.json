There is an onion allergy in our household and we had to get the food out of the home immediately. The meal was thrown out due to them recognizing and then ignoring the special request. They had my phone number, they should have called me regarding this to allow me to change or cancel the order. I\u2019ve never been to a hibachi restaurant that has already prepared food and cannot handle special requests, they always cook to order right in front of you. (No wonder it was prepared so quickly). Will never order from here or go to any Quickway again.",

Also, when i placed the order, my phone number was listed so why not call me to confirm like good customer service places do?

My husband and daughter bought food from quick fire while me and my other daughter went to buy food from Chipotle and we took our food into quick fire. The manager sent an employee to tell us we have to go outside but I tried to respond but the employee just ignored me. We stayed to try and finish our food but the manager then came to our table to threaten me and my family. We saw the sign that said no sodas from another place but it didn't say no food from another place. Then he threatened us again and said he was calling the police and that made my daughters cry. My husband just told the manager that HE would call the police because the manager didn't want to give him his money back even though my husband barely touched his food. So we just got outta there and agreed that we will never come to that quickfire ever again even if we really want to. The service is bad, rude and impolite. They barely have any customers. I would give a 0/5 if I could. My daughter told me that the first day she walked in she hated quickfire and now I understand why. No wonder she was always buying Chipotle instead.",
