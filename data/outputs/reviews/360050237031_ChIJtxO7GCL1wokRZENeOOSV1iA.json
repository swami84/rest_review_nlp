        "caption": "So upon doing research, trying to find the best place in NYC to get Birria tacos delivered. I stumbled across this place. I\u2019m very specific about my food and the places I order from. I always google the restaurant and read as many reviews as possible prior to ordering. After reading a few reviews found here on Google, I made the decision to not order from this restaurant. Not because there were reviews about the food being bad or anything of that nature, but because of how the management responds to customers who had an issue with their experience or food at this specific restaurant. I see a lot of back-handed comments coming from the management in return to the customers issue. One customer stated they asked for beef, but got some sort of pork product like (bacon) instead. The managers response was \u201cwe know the difference between bacon and beef\u201d. That is ABSOLUTELY not how you run a hospitality business. An apology followed by some sort of compensation or a solution to the problem should be offered. There is also a comment where a customer explained that they didn\u2019t have the best experience with their food. The managers response was that \u201cwhen people write these reviews it is intentionally hurting the business, especially a small business\u201d. No one is \u201cintentionally\u201d doing anything but describing their experience. It\u2019s up to YOU \u201cthe manager\u201d to make it right and make sure it doesn\u2019t  happen again so that your business can continue to be successful. My reasoning for writing all of this is to inform the management so that they can prevent themselves from potentially hurting their business. Believe it or not there\u2019s lot\u2019s of people like me out there who always reads reviews not just from the customer, but how management responds as well. A bad manager\u2019s response can be just as bad as a customers bad review and turn a customer aways just as fast. Either way good luck moving forward, I just felt like this was needed to be said.",
