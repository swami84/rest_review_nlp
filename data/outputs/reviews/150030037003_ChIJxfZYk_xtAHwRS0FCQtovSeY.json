Sushi was fresh and tasty and the hubby even enjoyed my favorites the butter scallops and baked mussels which he doesn't care too much for in general. Friendly atmosphere but the service is a bit slow. Over the course of an hour and a half we did not receive all of our food. Just give yourself some time to dine here just in case for a 5 star experience. We'll definitely return when we we aren't on a time crunch.",

I also appreciated how they don't make oversized rolls - the pieces fit into your mouth! My favorite part of the meal was the mussel miso soup: I ordered it twice in one meal. The fresh spring mix salad included a variety of veggies but a bit overpriced for what it was. Service was excellent: he was very friendly and efficient. Price-wise, this restaurant is very affordable for the excellent quality of food. A couple bucks more than one would pay for pre-made sushi at Whole Foods but a whole lot better. This restaurant is also in a great spot of Honolulu, an easy walk to Ward Theaters, Ala Moana Beach Park, and several free parking garages. Perhaps the only downside is the fact that the restroom is outside of the restaurant in the adjacent Ward shopping center. Not a huge problem for us but may pose an issue for those with disabilities or with small children.",
