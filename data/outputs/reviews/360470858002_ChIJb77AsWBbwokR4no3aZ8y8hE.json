The most egregious was the most recent: I asked that the catfish not have a  \"hard fry.\" My request was on the printed receipt I received with my order. The fish was so hard fried that it crumbled!  I don't order from chain restaurants because I want to keep my hard-earned dollar$ in the community. None of this is FREE, and to have my requests ignored does not change my wanting to support our community. It makes me think twice about who, in our community, I will continue to support.  #Frustrated",

The one complaint I could have had was the food being OVER seasoned.. and in my eyes that\u2019s not much of a complaint I\u2019ll rather my food be too flavorful than flavorless. I ordered Turkey wings, yellow rice and yams and my boyfriend ordered fried chicken, Mac and cheese and collard greens and I ate all his Mac and cheese and some of my yellow rice because it was soooo good.

We ordered the BBQ Chicken (5\ud83c\udf1f), Collard Greens (5\ud83c\udf1f), Mac N Cheese (5\ud83c\udf1f), Candied Yams (5\ud83c\udf1f), Fried Shrimp (5\ud83c\udf1f), Fried Whiting (4\ud83c\udf1f), and the Potato Salad (5\ud83c\udf1f). We thoroughly enjoyed the food. It was seasoned very well, and not over salted like many other soul food restaurants.  Now the reason for the four stars is due to the long wait. We weren't too upset about it  but when we did receive our order from the Uber Eats driver, some items were missing. We immediately called the restaurant and explained that our two orders of mac n cheese didn't arrive. The gentleman who we spoke with (possibly the owner) was apologetic and accommodating. He drove over the missing items himself along with a couple of extras for our troubles. That was a 10 \ud83c\udf1f customer service experience.  This is definitely a place I will patronize again and recommend to others.",

I gave 2 stars because I always try to support my kinfolk however they always make me wait for an excessive amount of time like on purpose. This is not the first time but it is my last time supporting this business. The cashier was very attentive and kind but didn't inform me about their lack of services because they didn't change the oil they took away my option to say if I would wait or leave. The young girl who worked there was eating her food didn't wash her hands got up went and started preparing an online order when I asked her about the crab she had attitude. You should not serve people food with that energy. I waited over 30mins for a 2 piece fish sandwich that they overcharged me for and the receipt on my ordered  I received was rip so I couldn't see the prices that she charge me. Intuitively my gut instinct told me the sign says $2. The food is great the customer service sucks as in most Caribbean restaurants.",

Two of us sat at the counter (only seats available) and shared a gigantic bouillabaisse. It was very filling. Great value - a ton of fish. Exceptional staff. We loved it. PS while we waited the owner brought out complimentary clam chowder to everyone and thanked us for waiting. All well done.",

The rice was a good texture and it was well seasoned . The macaroni and cheese was soft but it had an even distribution of cheese , macaroni and seasoning . I wasn\u2019t amazed by the flavor of the jerk chicken but it was cooked well . All in all this is a solid food choice and I may return for another dish . I\u2019ve seen great reviews online about the crab legs .",

Then, another paying customer asked to use the restroom and Shaunalee, the cashier, said \"NO\" remorselessly and carelessly for the customer.  Talk about bad customer service!!! Even worse, isn't that a health problem. Isn't every restaurant, take out or not,  suppose to  provide a restroom for paying customers????

However, I went in on Friday, August 10th and things were extremely unprofessional due to the female at the register. As usual the young man as well as the young woman preparing the food wore gloves and were very kind. The female at the register not only ignored me for at least 10 mins while I waited directly in front of her but also did not acknowledge me before she walked to the kitchen area. The young man preparing the food noticed my anger and asked what I wanted so that he could prepare it while I waited to order at the register. Once the female returned she again ignored me and paced back and forth with phone in hand. The young woman preparing the food walked over and apologized for her co worker\u2019s Unprofessionalism and took my order and money. While waiting for my order, I noticed the female who had been handing the register and phone suddenly start touching and helping to prepare the food without washing her hands or wearing gloves. \u201cHow disgusting!\u201d I thought to myself as I kept an eye on my food to make sure she did not have any part in touching or preparing it. When she once again went to the kitchen I mentioned it to the young man and he agreed she should\u2019ve been wearing gloves like everyone else on staff. However, the female came back and not only refused to wear gloves but cursed at the young man in a playful manor and ignored the request. She then looked at me with a few take out plates in her hand and asked what I ordered, as if she would be the one preparing my food to go. I looked at her and confirmed my order then said \u201cI do not like anyone touching my food or anything my food has to go in without gloves on\u201d. She responded with an attitude \u201cI asked you a question. I\u2019m not preparing your food.\u201d I responded \u201cGood. I was just letting you know in case.\u201d FOOD PREP 101 ALL EMPLOYEES HANDLING FOOD SHOULD BE WEARING GLOVES!!! Not to mention her hands and nails were black with dirt and disgusting along with her entire appearance, shirt and all. I\u2019m really disappointed that this will result in me never entering this restaurant while she is there.  Kudos to the rest of the staff\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d Thank you guys for remaining professional & friendly during my visits.",

The candied yams really tastes like candy so if you have a sweet tooth this will hit the spot. The salmon was a tad charred at the bottom(the only reason why I took off one star) but it didn\u2019t take away from the taste. I would definitely order from here again.
