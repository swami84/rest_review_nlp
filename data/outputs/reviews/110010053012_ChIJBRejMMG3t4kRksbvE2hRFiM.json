There\u2019s no phone inside and you can\u2019t make a reservation and you almost don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re walking into when you first see it. It\u2019s a fixed menu that rotates often and the environment is very bare-bones spartan in nature.  The food is always an interesting culinary journey but my one large complaint would be that the chef tends to make things overly spicy. I like spicy food and have quite a high tolerance for the heat of most dishes ranging from Thai to West African from Korean to Indian or Liberian. But I feel like when a chef pours so much heat into their dishes,  that just like the mistake of over salting or over sweetening a dish, you hide the complexities and layers of the flavors. I feel like the chef in Little Serow is an offender of this mistake. The dishes have nuances to them better than overpowered and overwhelmed by just too much spiciness. I can take a wonderful dish would you put some ghost pepper in there, for example, you don\u2019t taste anything else but the heat. They don\u2019t use ghost peppers there I\u2019m only using that pepper is example because most people know it to be Very high in the charts.",

We decided to show up 30 minutes before the restaurant opened on a Saturday night. We sat in line for 30 minutes and were able to snag a table in the restaurant though there were a limited amount of tables.  The service was great and very attentive. At the beginning they served us a plate of vegetables and sticky rice as an accompaniment to the dishes. The dishes have a lot of fresh herbs in them and very strong tangy, sour, sweet, and other flavors that you would not normally see in most restaurants.  Food: - nam prik ta daeng (salted fish paste) - This was one of my favorite dishes! It was a thick tasty fish paste served with fried pork rinds as chips to eat with the sauce. - tom saep (cold mushroom soup) - The cold soup was very strong in a sour way and cold. I wasn't very fond of this. - yum wun sen (glass noodle salad) - The noodle salad was pretty good, tangy and packed with herbs. - laap gai chiang mai (chicken lettuce wraps) - Chicken wraps were another favorite because it was fun using the cabbage leaves to pick up the ground chicken like nachos. - tow hu thouk (crispy fried tofu) - The tofu was perfectly crispy and fried, but very strong coconut milk taste which was a little different. - phat fak thawng (zephyr squash, holy basil stir fry) - I liked this stir fry a lot. Not sure if I have had this type of squash before, but it was good with the egg on top and the soy sauce. - si krong muu (pork ribs) - This was my favorite dish of them all! Unfortunately, I was pretty full by the end of the 7 courses, but the ribs were very tender and packed with flavor.  Overall, the meal was very unique and the dishes are not something you would see at a normal Thai restaurant. I am glad I was able to try Little Serow out, but not sure if I would come back.",

The restaurant is tucked away in a basement level of a lovely leafy street, atmospheric with dim lighting and quite an industrial minimal feel. I liked the vibe. Staff were super-friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks on offer - occasionally suggesting (or bringing) a suitable match for a dish.  It was a tasting menu format - at $54 for the amount of food I got in an evening slot, that is a steal. It was truly almost enough for 2 people. The initial dish of \"nam prik\" (spicy paste of green tomato, salt fish and shallots), served with crispy pork skins, boded extremely well for the rest of the meal. I was not disappointed \u2013 everything that followed was delicious. The sour fruit salad in particular was exploding with zingy flavours, very authentic.  The tofu dish was really excellent. It's crispy on the outside with plenty of flavour and a soft texture inside. Alchemy at work.  The only dish that I didn't like was the \"phat neua\" - beef with asparagus. It was overly sweet and heavy at a point in the menu where you need some relief before the last sticky wonderfulness of pork ribs. To be honest, I could have done without that dish entirely and still felt I'd had more than enough value.  It's really a great place to spend an evening. I ended up having a great chat with my neighbour on the long table - the food is so good that you can strike up conversations to discuss it.  I would go back in a heartbeat, and would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

The experience is nice. The price for the food, I think it is way too much.  Nam prik was nice. They gave us extra vegs.  I like the pork sausages. I wish they gave more of that.  Strong lemon grass flavor which i like.  The glass noodle was probably the spiciest dish. It reminded of papaya salad.  Laap pla laana reminded me of fish cakes. My wife said it normal takes long time to make. They gave us a lot of it.  If i had some fish sauce this was would perfect.  The tofu with peanut... i didnt like it. Normally i like anything with coconut milk... this taste like..peanut butter curry without the curry soup part. It was sweet.  The beef with mustard green. Exaclty how i thought it would taste. Its the only thing our table couldnt finish because it was strong. This would go well with congee/porridge.  Pork rib was soft, it isnt strong as the rest of the dish. I enjoyed it.  At the end they gave you this cocunut dessert. It was really small, i have the pan used to cook it, it is normally a lot bigger.  I like the rice milk, it was sweet, almost like condensed milk.  If you don't have access to Thai food, this would be a good experience.  If you do end up in Thailand, you can probably get this meal for under 10 dollars. I don't know about DC, but in South Philly you probably can get some of these from the people who sell food at the park.  The staffs were friendly.",

My friends and I went on a Saturday - arrived at 4:45 and were promptly seated when they opened at 5:30.  Each course was amazing. There were seven courses, and I enjoyed all of them and loved most of them (one friend out of three didn't like one course, but out of seven, I'll call that a great track record).  The service was also amazing.  Our server made great recommendations on wine to three people with distinct tastes, and we all like what we got. Our water was filled every few minutes like clockwork.  Highlights: - the soup was amazing - the spicy kick and lime flavor are a perfect balance to the coconut - the ground chicken with lanna spices - another expertly balanced dish that combines spices, heat, lemongrass and ginger to create a dish that is great on its own, wrapped in lemon or with rice. - crispy tofu - bold flavor and perfect texture. - ribs - I don't even normally like meat on the bone, but the smokiness is spot on and it's fall off the bone tender.",

You can't make reservations so please arrive early as they can only seat 28 at a time. The food is a rollercoaster of spice, flavour and texture. The menu changes weekly but you can be rest assured there will be sticky rice and ample fresh crunchy vegetables. The food has a distinct northern Thai flavour so don't expect any standard curries.

All the dishes are great, but I wish they weren't ALL spicy. Don't get me wrong, I like spicy food. I go straight to the dishes with hot pepper icons on most menus and have only eaten something too, too hot twice in my life. But, I've found I prefer a mix of spicy and mild  dishes together. The mini coconut cakes (about the size of a nickel) were awesome. Waiting in line/timing: They open at 5.30. On a Friday in July, I got in line at 5-ish. I think I was the 23rd person in line. If I remember correctly, I could have eaten immediately or about 6.30-ish. I let people in line go ahead of me until the waiting list was closer to 8/8.30.",

I felt to be in a surial comedy skit ... where is the hidden camera? Like in \u201cthe emperor\u2019s clothes\u201d everyone is going along pretending to enjoy a sequence of  unetable dishes. Everything Was So salty like the dishes were mistakly salted 3 times. The level of spiciness so high that you could not taste anything else but the heat. If After salt and spice you were still able to taste anything you had the luck to taste bloody chicken liver and beef that felt left out from the fridge too long. The ingredients so smushed and soggy that to the eye looked baby food. In this absurd senario, the ridiculous minuscule portion\u2019s sizes\u2014 served in China no bigger than a little girl tea set \u2014 become not only acceptable but welcome. To make things worse if possible your dinner is served in the  slowest possible way and you have to go through this excruciating senario  (that will cost you $50 a head.... how do they get away with this!!!!) seating in the most uncomfortable stool you could have. Only positive note nice staff yet not enough to balance out the terrible experience. Save your money and not go.... and please a food critic needs to review this restaurant and call things by their names.",

The highlights for us were the amazing fried tofu salad with a coconut milk dressing and the super-umami minced chicken drizzled with golden fried shallots. Also the delicate but spicy lemon grass soup with fish dumplings. The meal was well worth the 50 dollars we paid for it!",

Not even how spicy the dish is, which is a bit ridiculous when I had with me someone who had very sensitive palates, and they woke up in pain from how spicy one of the dishes was.  The only reason I gave this place over a two is due to the people that worked there. We were lucky to have one of the nicest servers out there, which was comforting, but it definitely did not change how inelastic the place was. Also for a 59$ meal that usually would cost 3-5$ in Thailand, please be a little more elastic with how spicy a plate is. At the end of the day, we are eating it, and not you.

We were told that we could not split the meal, so we each paid the $49 a person; it did not feel like we received two meals. The photos of the food look to be generous portions, but the plates are only about 4 inches in diameter. Every dish was nicely spiced, but I feel this was done to distract the customer from realizing that they are not eating authentic Thai food. For an appetizer you get three or four pork rinds, then a scoop of corn kernels with fish sauce on it, followed by some rice noodles with a little shrimp. The short ribs were mediocre, we received four (for two people). The dessert is a tiny cube of sticky rice (which is what was served continuously throughout the meal. Overall, skip this place until the price decreases or the food options increase.",

I have an aversion to cilantro and had to pick it out of virtually every dish.  In fairness I was warned that they use cilantro in many of their dishes.  But after watching the dishes being prepared I think it's weird that you wouldn't agree to withhold the cilantro where possible (such as where it's a garnish).  On a positive note, the wait staff was friendly.  BTW, cilantro aside, and having nothing to do with the hot spices (yes, most dishes were satisfyingly hot), I didn't love most of the dishes.  Pork ribs were tender and delicious and the tray of greens were incredibly fresh and were a good foil for the hot food, but the sticky rice was barely warm and overly sticky and the catfish was overcooked.  I know I'm in the minority and perhaps biased based on their stated refusal to remove cilantro, but I write it as I taste it....",

        "caption": "Sawadee krup So I found this restaurant on several sites listed among the top 5 in DC.  Some reviews I read say people line up before they open to get a table since no reservations are accepted.  Here is one review \u201cCognoscenti swear that chef owner Johnny Monis has \u201cabsolutely nailed\u201d Northern Thailand\u2019s \u201chotter than heck\u201d night stall cuisine at this semi \u201csecret\u201d Dupont Circle basement\u201d We arrived at this unmarked door with 4 people in line.  The door would open and a nice guy (Host) would ask the next group in.  After 5 minutes we were asked in, name and cell number taken and told we would get a text in an hour when our table was ready. In an hour we got our text.  We were met by the Host at the door (never got his name). After inquiring if we could handle spicy food and had no allergies we were escorted to our table by our Host and Mary (Hostess).  These two were the most congenial staff in the place. I quickly learned there was neither a Thai in the place nor anyone who could even speak basic Thai. Interesting start. Here was our menu: Week of May 19, 2015 nam prik narohk snakehead fish / tamarind / shrimp paste tom saep gapi shrimp / mushroom / sawtooth yam makheua yao eggplant / cured duck egg / shallot laap gai chiang mai chicken / offal / lanna spices tow hu thouk tofu / cilantro root / peanut yum pla duk catfish / lemongrass / chili jam si krong muu pork ribs / mekhong whiskey / dill $45 ** sorry, no substitutions; dishes may contain pork, shellfish and nuts, even when not listed  The nam prik narohk was excellent.  However, I detected a hint of liquid smoke flavoring? The tom saep gapi soup was a wonderful cold soup.  However, my friend made what became the gaff of the night when the soup arrived.  It came in a large bowl, with smaller bowls and a Thai style spoon.  My friend asked the waitress who was talking to the people seated next to us for another soup spoon and was admonished for interrupting her. Yes, the wait staff admonished us for daring to interrupt her and ask for something. She (also did not get name) would not look at us the rest of the night.  She acted like a pretentious ass from that point on. She would place something in front of us, refill our water, etc. with eyes averted and a snarl on her face.  I saw her smile and interact with many other patrons, but she made a huge point of making us feel unwelcome.   This went on so long I finally apologized to her for interrupting.  She responded with \u201cApology accepted\u201d turned and walked away.  Really, so she was acting this way because we interrupted and asked for a spoon? The apology did nothing to change her cold shoulder and complete disdain for us as customers. The other servers we interacted with were not friendly either and acted as they were just going through the motions. Everything else on the menu was good with the exception of the catfish.  The catfish was fried. It was so overcooked I thought it was cracklin, not fish. Also, several dishes were too heavy on the cilantro. As for the fiery spices, anyone who knows me knows I sweat when I eat true Thai food.  I never broke a sweat here. There was spice in some dishes, however nothing like I get in Bangkok, Chiang Mai or Hua Hin. The food absolutely did NOT nail hotter-than-heck night-stall cuisine. But, overall it was still very good food. The overall experience rated a 2 out of 5 stars in my book.  The food was a 4 but the treatment by the serving staff ruined the experience.  We were treated like we should feel privileged we were allowed to eat here (except by Mary and the Host). Good luck. If that is the attitude they are trying to portray, they succeeded.

Naturally delicious without gimmicks. Can't say enough about how great it was. VERY VERY spicy... just be ready for it. Get the rice milk it cuts the heat quite a bit.  Place had very cool 50s decor.

The line can stretch all the way down to the CVS on the corner of 17th and P NW and offers great people watching and interactivity as curious passers by ask what is going on.  If you're less interested in the line and more interested in the food, plan on getting there before the restaurant opens at 5:30pm, and I mean early. On the other hand, if you want to really enjoy the line waiting to get a table at this extremely popular thai restaurant, you should plan to arrive anywhere between 5 minutes after it opens to 45 minutes before it opens. That's worked for me in my experience.  The best days to enjoy the line are Fridays and Saturdays, BUT if you want more of an amuse-bouche line experience at Little Serow, try the middle of the week.  Hang in there though, I have heard universally that it's affordable, delicious and it's totally worth the wait.",

I like the concept (set menu, intimate space) but the booking process is incredibly inconvenient (they do not accept normal reservations). You (or a member of your party) must line up before they open to get on the list -- if you show up after 7 you will likely not get a table (at least not before 10pm). They text you when your table is ready and you have 10mins to show up. After several failed attempts we finally got an 8:30 table one Friday but they texted at 8pm and because my train was late I did not make it until 8:30. Fortunately they were incredibly nice about letting my wife hold the table until I arrived, but the experience was much too stressful (even considering the amazing food). Just be forewarned. I give the food and service 5+ stars but the booking process 1 star.",

We got there by 4:30, waited until 5:30 when the restaurant opened up to put our names down. We were told to come back at 8:30, so we decided to eat some appetizers at Sushi Taro first and then come back.  Eventually we came back and were seated and served. Everything was ridiculously salty. We couldn't finish any of the plates because the food was so salty and watered down. No bold flavors. No spiciness. The worst part was that Johnny Monis was at the restaurant, bringing plates to his customers. Did he taste the food before it was brought out? How can he serve that to his customers? The people next to us thought it was really salty too and there were no bold flavors, so it wasn't just us.  We couldn't finish any of the food. The wine was also flat and overpriced. It was the most disappointing over $100 meal I've ever paid and eaten. It's hard to believe this is a 28/30 rating on Zagat. It was just like eating salt and greens.  I will say that the service is very good. All the servers were very friendly and accommodating and the food was brought out quickly.  At least Sushi Taro was good... only upside to the night. I don't know what happened but maybe they were having an off night, but then reading the recent reviews, someone else mentioned they had a bad experience too and they thought every dish was salty as well, so maybe it's been an off week? Hope so, because this place is highly rated and everyone says it's really good. May have to come back in the future and hope for a better meal.",
