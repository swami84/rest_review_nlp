The other two places (both called Tony\u2019s *of course lol) I have tried on two occasions each, once to try it out and the second to confirm the first time wasn\u2019t just garbage by some random fluke. I must say, being an Italian myself (who speaks Italian and has lived In Italy for many years), these guys know what they are doing, also they are Italians themselves. Everything, from the sauce to the cheese to the dough is of the best quality, and there is literally no slice I haven\u2019t tried at this point and I would recommend them ALL, as well as their mozzarella sticks (really good!) and their paninis as well as their soups!! Again, EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!! Also, the place is family owned and run, you can tell they put their hearts and souls in this place and they certainly love what they are doing since they come in every day with a smile and great customer service. In conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a pizza place in the neighborhood/Bushwick/Ridgewood, or you\u2019re still going to either one of those Tony\u2019s on Knickerbocker, then do yourself a favor and look no further than Il Bel Paese Pizzeria e Trattoria :) trust me, you will NOT regret it ;)",
