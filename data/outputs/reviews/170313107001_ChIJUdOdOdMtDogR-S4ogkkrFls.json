It didnt taste good with the big chunks of almonds. The scorpian was okay, the flavor of it wasn't what we expected. The eel sauce is the only thing that made it edible. Besides that, it's really cool place and the service was great. I also liked how the patio is communal so you can order drinks at the bar next door.",
