The food encompasses farm to table in decor and every single element, blending northern Italian pleasantries with hearty American faire. Always get the bread and butter, always get whatever the dessert is that is served in a cup, both will always be different and delicious. Go on a pasta adventure, try the thing you aren\u2019t confident in, or go for the old standby bucatini that will never disappoint.  I am a self proclaimed die hard fan of chef Kevin and Deb, who have been feeding me for about 10 years now and Chef has never made a dish I truly didn\u2019t enjoy. I will always return here first upon coming home, and find any excuse to make a meal at faro.  Endlessly smitten.",

The pan seared scallops were the perfect combination of richness and flavor, while the Sedani (their homemade Bolognese) with thinly sliced shallots, (what I tasted) garlic and delicate crumble of beef was both fatty and acidic with the pasta cooked just al dente.  Service was what you\u2019d expect in a restaurant of this caliber, friendly, but not helicoptering around you, plates arrived relatively quickly but they did not ask us if we wanted to main served and we waited a while because we had a few half eaten starters still on the table.  Space is airy but still warm, the ideal mix of casual and upmarket, I can see this being an ideal first date, though the higher ceilings and wood fixtures did the sound a bit so be expected to yell a little across the table. Bar tables would probably be better for a twosome. Cozy and welcoming.  Only minus on the stars because one of the two bathrooms has no hook or table to place personals, pretty sure the gals in Bushwick still carry bags. Toilet paper super thin :p wouldn\u2019t ordinarily mention it but I eat in a range of all restaurants and these pluses are what you would expect at a restaurant like this.",

I've been to Faro probably 12 or 15 times, on dates, with friends, with family, once or twice by myself. Chef Kevin Adey and his wife/co-owner Deb are absolutely fantastic, super sweet and unassuming, very welcoming, which is rare for a trendy Michelin-starred spot. More importantly, the food is unbelievably good. I'm old school Italian from the New York area, so I tend to be pretty traditional when it comes to pasta. But Chef Kevin is a freaking genius, and he's able to blend old tradition and contemporary innovation and creativity in a way that is extremely difficult to pull of. He'll make some obscure but delicious form of hand-made fresh pasta that dates back hundreds of years to some region of Italy, and then combine it with something super modern, and marry the old and the new in a way you would never expect. I can't say enough about this place, it's an absolute must-try. I highly recommend the tasting menu, you get to sit up at the kitchen and watch them make everything, and Chef Kevin will tell you about every dish and often the history behind what he's doing. God I love this place.",

The bread, while not complimentary, is also a standout.  Cocktail selection and wine list are both fantastic. Excellent service accompanies great food and beverage.  Pricing is a bit high, but I understand paying for quality. The only knocks against this restaurant - one of Brooklyn's best from a culinary standpoint - would be the noise level and its location. And while it can be a bit hard to get there, it is certainly worth a trip (or two or three if you're a local).",

We wanted the tasting menu and Faro's website asks you to call them if you want the tasting menu. We called, had to leave a message because of the time difference and heard nothing back. We tried calling a couple of other times and got absolutely nothing. On the day, I called to tell them what had happened and they simply said we couldn't have the tasting menu because they didn't have the right amount of food in. No apologies, no compensation or discount - just a flat out 'no can do'. Very surprised by such a lack of service in the US. We cancelled our booking and were very happy they didn't get $500 of our custom. I'm sure their food is good but don't bother if you want to have a pleasant experience.",

I thought the food was descent but not good enough to convince us to come back in the future. We did wine pairing. The sparkling wine & the white wine for first two meals were pretty good. But didn't like the red wines for third and forth meal. They were light red wines (which we like) but had weird artificial flavor which wasn't enjoyable. All and all, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service but a bit disappointed in the food and wine pairing.",

Fluke is delightfully sweet and the slight sourness from apple plus the creaminess from avocado made a good combo. Crab mixed well with cauliflower pur\u00e9e while squid ink vinaigrette added more savory. Fazzoletti was full of egg flavor, pairing with garlic sauce became a solid wholesome dish. However, the main courses are less impressive compared to the appetizers. The lobster, though very tender, didn't feel like a cohesive dish with the cannelini beans and the muscle did not add much on top, and the three different ingredients with 3 different temperature made the dish more far apart. The cod felt a bit overcooked, while the crispy outside was nice, the inside was not as tender and juicy as I expected from cod, and I didn't taste much of the sweetness from cod either. Turtle chocolate tart pulled the meal back a bit by its light and gooey caramel wrapped in dark chocolate and walnuts, topped with fluffy vanilla cream. Overall a good meal with some areas of improvement.  Last note, Faro's pasta game is really strong, will definitely want to try more of their pasta dishes in the future.",

We got the faux gras tart, which was actually faux gras mixed with butter, which was actually just butter with a tiny bit of faux gras in the mix. Taking a bite of it felt like I was biting into a stick of butter. Maybe they forgot the faux gras in mine?  We also got the squid ink pasta. The crab sauce was unbelievable, really fantastic, but the pasta just wasn't cooked through. I love al dente, but this wasn't al dente. Maybe they accidentally set the timer one minute too short?  Lastly, we got the buttacini, and the fowl meal pasta, both of which were perfect. 3 stars because of the hyped expectations, and the misses on half the plates.",

I won't be able to return to the restaurant unless its for a special occasion. The prices and portions aren't inviting for everyday eating, especially for a Bushwick neighborhood. The portions are pretentious and it seems they're not aiming to welcome the original residents from the area and their target audience are just the new upper-class residents that have moved into the gentrified neighborhood.  The summer squash was fantastic but for $14 I should have gotten more than a thinly sliced cucumber and a 2inch piece of squash. Maybe if it was at least 3 or 4 pieces it would have been satisfying. The waitstaff is attentive, the open kitchen layout is really cool and overall it was a great date-but we had to buy some food afterwards again to fill up. I ordered the strawberry flan for dessert and it was excellent.",

I do not recommend the fazzoletti. I thought this dish would be good because it has buratta and a pork ragu but it lacked salt and other flavor.  New York Strip was ok. Duck entree was not impressive.  Bread and butter was good but keep in mind they charge $6 for a roll.  Gin cocktail was good but very sweet. After drinking 3 I was barely buzzed.",

Hospitality was second rate - they asked you if the food was ok, but they don't really care.  We left two courses with more than half left on our plate, and they never asked us what was wrong with them.  The bar stools for the prix fixe  dinner were incredibly uncomfortable - it cut circulation to the legs after a while.  We started to stand and eat our dessert, but again, no one asked us what was wrong.  A big negative when it comes to hospitality.  We ordered the prix fixe and some dishes were creative, but the pasta itself tasted fine, nothing special.  Some dishes were too bland or the pasta was not especially appetizing (like one dish where it was baked in rectangles and tasted like firm polenta mush).",

The Mackerel Crudo and the Petite Lettuces were both very uninteresting and not very flavorful, and while I enjoyed the Foie Gras (even with the toast that was served burnt) and the Roasted Beets, neither were above average in terms of taste or creativity.  Of the five pastas I sampled, one was completely inedible and incredibly fishy (the Squid Ink Rigatoni), another was disliked by the entire table (the Strangelopretti) and the Agnolotti was fine, but not good and I wouldn't order it again.  We did all like the Gnochetti (which only comes in an appetizer sized portion) and the Scarpinocc, but enjoying 2 out of 5 pasta dishes are not good odds for a Michelin star restaurant.  We also ordered the Scallops, which were also fine, but felt like something I can replicate at home and were not impressive, and the Bread and Butter, which were not worth paying for and I had to chase someone down to bring the butter because the server only brought is the bread.  I wouldn't recommend traveling into Bushwick for what turned out to be a mediocre meal, at best.",

So I changed my order and another 20 minutes later my filet mignon was served. The waitress was really apologetic the whole time. The steak was good and the other meals ordered were as well. The bill came and the waitress informed me that my meal would be free including the beer. She also brought me some uncooked pasta to bring home saying that he chef had freshly made it and wanted me to try it. Best customer service I've experienced at a restaurant. I never complained or asked for anything, they just did it. I would definitely go back.",

I've eaten at many Michelin Star restaurants in NYC and this is right up there. We sat at the chef's table and it very cool to see the chefs cooking and everything being prepared. The decor inside is very Brooklyn and pretty awesome; elegant, relaxed and classy all at the same time.. The bread is cooked in this wood fired oven and served to you with their homemade butter when it first comes out, definitely some of the best ever. Our main courses were the pork special that night (amazing) and octopus (so good and fresh!). We started with the tomato, fresh mozzarella and beet salad which is much more elegant than it sounds; care was taken with peeling the vegetables and it was so tasty and different..We also had a cavatelli with summer truffles as an in-between--kind of like a super fancy freshly made mac on cheese on crack (but with truffles lol). For dessert we had chocolate olive oil cake with some ice cream on top and arugula sorbet--sounds and tasted different than anything I've ever had, but it was legit. Can't wait to continue going back!",
