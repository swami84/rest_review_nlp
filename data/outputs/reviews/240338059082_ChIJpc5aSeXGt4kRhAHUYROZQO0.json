Not in an adventurous mood so I just went with a bento box. Came with four pieces of California Roll which were really good.  The staff is extremely friendly. I walked in and the very nice hostess asked if this was my first time here. \"Yes.\" So she walked me quickly through the entire menu.

The burritos have a very thin layer of rice (this is also a very good sign!) and HUGE sashimi chunks. The lettuce gives a nice crunch, and is used sparingly.  I highly recommend getting something with salmon in it. They don't use the cheap stuff. The salmon was so fatty and good.  The owner also gave me a free wonton with my order. She didn't speak English too well, but you can definitely tell this mom and pop shop has a huge customer focus that many places lack these days.",
