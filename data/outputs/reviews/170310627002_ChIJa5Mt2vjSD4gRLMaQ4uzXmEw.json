They use high quality olive oil in their dishes (not vegetable oil like some other local Italian spots) and you can tell the difference.  Food always tastes fresh and never greasy or over-salted. We've done takeout a couple of times, and the quality or portions have not changed from their indoor dining days.  Their gnocchi, calamari, and their bread is always worth savoring, and the other dishes are good, too!",

        "caption": "Priced like an elegant meal when really it's just decent Italian food with poor execution. There's no spark of passion in this place.  Free bread is cold and most likely not homemade. Being sat near a waiter station, I saw them taking the baskets from the pile of 2 dozen baskets, and restocking those 2 dozen baskets about once an hour. I think Olive Garden has a better, warmer, fresher bread experience.  We ordered the SPECIAL caprese salad with mushrooms, mozzerella, basil, and tomatoes; when it comes out it has exactly 2 CHERRY tomatoes on the whole plate, and exactly 1 WHOLE basil leaf, and mozzerella was nothing better than grocery store...clearly needed more attention to basics because I could execute this better at home.  Pasta was good flavor but poor texture/cooking, I think the rigatoni noodles were just too thick. Earlier in the meal, the waiter told us they get their pasta from a small shop in north Chicago, so they're clearly trying a little bit...but for a local upscale (read: expensive) Italian shop...how are you not making your own noodles??? By the way, this dish was the one the waiter said 'Everyone should order this at least once here in their lifetime.'  Espresso: We were sat near their espresso machine; twice I saw a waiter begin to make a fancy coffee, activating the steamer and putting it in the cup, moving it around and such...and then he would dump anything in the cup out, look over his shoulder, and discreetly open up the cupboard below and pour coffee from an urn into the cup. There's two logical explanations here and I don't know which one is worse. 1) The patrons ordered coffee and he was heating up the cup before putting pre-brewed coffee in there (which must be at least an hour old because I never saw them change it), or 2) They ordered an espresso based drink, and the waiter fakes making it, only to pour pre-brewed coffee into the cup. Either way something is wrong there.  Lastly, ambiance was a little bit off putting, right in front of my view (near the espresso machine) were ~4 credit card reading machines all charging up with wires hanging down near my date's head. Needs a tune-up.",

My friend and I had tried calling (not sure if there was a bad number listed or what) and couldn't get through, but when we walked in we were welcomed by the whole staff. Our server was very attentive and even the bar tender came over to tell us all about a lovely post dinner port that we were trying. Good sized portions (but not overwhelming) and a great take on traditional Italian dishes. Great to know that we have an wonderful Italian place nearby!",

We called to reserve a table for two on a Saturday evening with three hour advance notice.  Uh ya... too late.  But, we still wanted to give it a try so we decided to just show up and see what happens. Yep... glad I did!!  We were sat immediately at the bar which was perfect for us.  Ample room and just enough seats to keep it cozy.  I wish I could remember our bartender's name because he was outstanding; between the wine and food pairing recommendations to the general conversation in between his duties, we had the best seat in the house.  The rest of the seating was well spaced out and could accommodate a couple's special occasion or the engagement party that was seated behind us. We started with the Grilled Calamari which was top notch.  She had the Fettuccine Cabornara and I had the Sea Bass which was on special.  The fettuccine was creamy deliciousness and the bass was a baked flaky forget the knife fall off the fork goodness.  As I said, the bartender paired us up both with wines that suited our meals.  One was a Montepulciano D'Abruzzo and the other was a Landmark Vinyards Pinot.  Perfect - period!!! For desert, we had a Pumpkin Gelato and my chocolate addiction kept me steering toward the Flourless Chocolate Cake with a vanilla sauce that added to my sweet tooth. As I said earlier Sal's is a small establishment set on the west side of Southport Ave just north of Diversey.  Don't sneeze and pass this place up.  You will regret it!",

When I asked about them they said they were for upcoming reservations. Fine. But then we had to wait 20 minutes for our table and they seated us after our reserved time. They sat us at a table that was basically on top of the waiter's ordering computers, so we constantly had staff standing over our table talking. My entree got screwed up, and they didn't offer anything to make up for it. Eventually,  our meal was over and 5 of the 8 tables we saw available when we walked in were still empty. Probably not going to go back",

We were seated before 6pm when the restaurant was 1/4 full and people who were seated well after us were already gone while we sat puzzled and waited for our entrees. And we asked, and asked, and asked, and then even got up to get the manager. The food was definitely good. But this is a neighborhood spot and we had 2 young kids with us. If you are eating downtown on a Saturday dinner may take 2+ hours. But on a Thursday at 6pm?! Own up, explain, apologize, check in, and apologize again when we leave inviting us back. A free dessert when we were trying to pay and leave and had already declined dessert was not what we were looking for. I don't think I can go back unfortunately and I really would want to.",
