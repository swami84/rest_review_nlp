I'm always craving good falafel and other Middle Eastern staples and it's nearly impossible to come by here, but Chef Iman is a pro and her food immediately transports me.  Beyond the delicious food, your purchase supports people's livelihoods. The social enterprise is worker owned and provides refugee chefs and other immigrants an opportunity to work and share their food with us here in Baltimore while building a diverse, vibrant community. In case you ever have an event you need to get catered, there is NO better place to go than to Mera and now they are opening for take out!",
