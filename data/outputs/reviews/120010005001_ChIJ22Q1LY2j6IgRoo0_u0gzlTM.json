We are townies but have never been here before and I\u2019m kicking myself for taking so long.  Everything from the fresh, warm bread to the dessert was wonderful! We had the Lobster Escargot as an appetizer which was phenomenal. I had the 11oz Filet which was cooked perfectly. Honestly, I could have gotten away with the Petite Filet because the side portions are just huge! Broccolini with Toasted Almonds was the Seasonal Veggie and I wish I could have just taken a huge order home of it. Also, do yourself a favor and get the Lyonnaise Potatoes. You will thank me later! Everything should be fried in Duck Fat. There is nothing better!  My husband got their Ultimate Burger, which made me roll my eyes, but he likes to judge a restaurant on their burgers. If you can screw up something so simple, it says a lot! Mark\u2019s did not disappoint him. The size was huge, it was cooked just like he likes it (medium-well) but it was still juicy and not a hockey puck. He said it was well worth it and he promised me he would order a steak the next time we went.  They treated us to a Chocolate Paradise dessert since it was our anniversary, which was amazing. It was like a giant truffle! It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  The service was spot-on from the moment we walked in the door to our amazing waitress, Becca. Ask for her when you go and tell her you read a review about her, it will make her night! She answered all my questions and gave me all her top recommendations which were perfect.  Thank you, Mark\u2019s Prime for giving us a wonderful and memorable night!",

The sides are served family style (I haven't had a side I didnt like) which makes it nice to get a few different ones to share with the group. It's more on the expensive side (compared to other places in Gainesville) but it also makes a wonderful place to take a date. I will be going back.",

Another example is that we asked if we could replace the fries with a burger with baked potato, but never was it mentioned it would cost an extra $8.95.

I have never had the service that we received anywhere else in Gainesville. Our server, Pauly was fantastic and spot on with his recommendations. The food was delicious and was presented well. It was very nice that on a busy Friday night that we did not feel rushed to leave. Pauly, with the help of the kitchen staff timed everything perfectly. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here and we will be back. Thank you to all of the folks at Mark's Prime for a wonderful evening!!",

We are forever in his debt, because this was unquestionably the best meal either of us have ever had. The decor is beautiful, polished wood and antique in appearance. The ambiance was very pleasant and the staff couldn't be more attentive and helpful. We both chose the surf & turf with grilled asparagus & fingerling potatoes as sides. Delicious homemade warm bread with real butter started the meal. The filets & lobster tails were beyond wonderful. Perfectly seasoned & perfectly done. The sides were exceptional as well, again perfectly seasoned & cooked. Portions were so generous, we couldn't eat everything. Dessert was a chocolate... something. Heavenly! This isn't a cheap place to have dinner - but it's worth every penny!",

When we mentioned it to the waiter he got a manager and the manager offered us sharper knives. (Sorry a knife will NOT change the texture of your meat).  We ordered a meal without dairy due to allergy, and specifically added that means no butter and no cream and were brought 3 dishes to the individual with an allergy with dairy. My fish was served with a sharp piece of hard plastic that I chewed in the shape of a star (like decor or a piece of confetti) on it that I spit out thinking it was a large bone  and showed the manager.  So disappointed in a restaurant that used to be so nice. Hopefully it was just an anomaly. However being offered a sharper knife for tough steak I would guess we were not the first.....",

I had asked several questions to one waitress about which items were gluten-free due to allergies then had to repeat them to the 3rd waiter. Food came out slow. Several other people who ordered after us got their food before ours. My steak was WAY over-cooked. An 11oz filet asked for \u201cmedium\u201d came out dry and nearly burnt.  Then I told the waiter we were now running late for the play around the corner and that even took forever to get the check to us and then to come back with the receipt to pay.  The play had an intermission and I was concerned about picking up my car that was valet parked, so I called the restaurant. They told me the valet stand closes at 9:45 so I had to leave before the play was over. When I picked up my car I found that the information I was given was incorrect.  It was our first visit and probably our last.",

        "caption": "I went to Mark's for Valentine's Day.  They were featuring a limited menu of about 4 choices per App, Salad, Entree, and then 3 desserts.  I knew this going into the meal, but it was still disappointing because they had none of their most interesting full menu items.  The overall feel of the meal was that we were animals being mass processed as fast as possible. We were seated in a room that was clearly made for 20+ person events, and they just put ~20 two person tables right next to each other. The lighting was far too bright, there were no decorations on any walls of any kind, and there was no division between tables. We could see and hear everyone else in the room. Also, there were about 10 waiters running around crazily at any given time which was very distracting. For the price, the food was TERRIBLE. The price was $145 per couple and two items we ordered were inedible. I know it was Valentine's day so they wanted to get people in and out, but for the price you really should get a better ambiance than the conveyor belt.  For appetizer, we chose the Oysters Rockefeller. They were poor and not what one would expect to get from such a dish. They only managed to put bacon on half of them, and they were waaay too heavy handed with the olive oil. They were very one note. Still, this was only the 3rd worst item we ordered.  The salads were fine. I mean, they were salads.  For main course we each got Filet & Lobster tail. The filets were good, for filets. It's not our favorite cut of steak but this was by far the most interesting main dish on the limited menu, especially based on the price tag of the meal.  My girlfriend's lobster was good but mine was a little overcooked and chewy.  For side dishes, we both attempted to order mashed potatoes. The waiter convinced us that the sides were \"huge\" and that we could easily share the potatoes and get a second side dish. From the start, I wasn't thrilled about this because the other side options were cauliflower, spinach, and asparagus, but I took his recommendation and went with the cauliflower because it was au gratin. In reality, the mashed potatoes were definitely not big enough to share. It was a single serving. Also, I'm pretty sure the cooks never even looked at salt while making them. Very bland. The cauliflower WAS big enough for two people, but it was undercooked and inedible. It tasted like it was raw; it was far too crunchy. I took only one bite.  For dessert, we tried the \"strawberry cheesecake\". It was actually plain cheesecake with strawberry sauce on top. This dish was also inedible. The sauce was cloying and completely overpowered everything. It tasted like it came from a can. A gross can. We took only one bite.  Post Review Bonus Update: After my review, a manager contacted me and apologized for the poor experience I had, which I appreciated. He asked if I would give Mark's another shot if he sent me a gift card in the mail. I said I would, and gave him my address. He never responded or sent the gift card. After my experience in the restaurant, I am not surprised with the lack of follow through.  I did not EXPECT a freebie after leaving my initial review, but the fact that one was offered and not delivered is pretty weak.",

I did not even have to say it was my Birthday to get special treatment, we got that just for walking through the door!  Our Waiter Fred went above and beyond and made us feel that this is the way we should be treated no matter what type of restaurant we walk into!  The atmosphere was very close knit and personal!  Even down to cleaning up the crumbs dropped on the table cloth from the delicious bread!  The food was way beyond expectations.  My husband ordered the 11oz Filet Mignon  (which he couldn't even finish) with a side of mashed potatoes and I had the Asiago Spinach stuffed chicken with Cauliflower au gratin.  Of course we had a doggie bag from all the food!  It was a little pricey, but well worth it.  This will definitely be our go to place for our special occasions and recommend everyone needing to feel like royalty go there!",

We both had the 16 oz Delmonico's, and they were cooked to perfection! Perfect med rare. Sides were outstanding as well. We had grilled asparagus, sauted mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and bacon roasted brussel sprouts .the homemade bread was great as well. Jessica, our server was exceptional! Very personable, and friendly, with outstanding knowledge of the menu. Five star experience no doubt! Pricey, but so worth it! We will definitely return for special occasions! Oh, and my fiance said yes!!",

It was soaked in butter and just a little garlic and topped with Asiago cheese melted on top. Although the lobster chunks were huge, it was not that flavorful, and should have had more garlic. I still enjoyed it and would order it again. My entree was grouper Santa Fe. This was a large piece of fish topped with a mango salsa.  This was exceptional. The sides of grilled asparagus and twice baked potato was excellent. Service was spot on and it was very quiet. We really enjoyed our dining experience and would go back again...... and again.",

We were quickly seated and then greeted by several young gentemen who quickly set us up,  gave us menus, poured water, and gave us a wine list. My husband quickly picked a wine and told one of the guys setting us up what bottle of wine we would like.  Glasses were brought and then our main waitress showed up. Her attitude was less than pleasant. She asked us about ordering wine and my husband said he had given his request to \"the guy who was just here\". Her response, \"well since he cant take an order you need to give it to me\". Now, it would not have been a big deal but she could have 1) tried to figure it out from who set us up or 2) been a bit more friendly and polite instead of arrogant and demeaning in her tone and attitude.  We also at this time gave her our order. Then things went from bad to worse. After an hour of waiting for food and a second bottle of wine later ( there were 5 drinking wine) we still did not have food. When I asked the waitress about our order she quickly replied it was our fault for not ordering appetizers or salad. Say what????? Then she said let me check and came back and said there was a delay in the kitchen. What the????  In my mind, if there were a delay in the kitchen she could have told us about it instead of me having to ask, could have been nicer in her response ( really... you have to wait for your food if you only order dinner? ) and  maybe should have offered something to tide us over until the order would arrive? Finally, our dinner arrives and everyone had their steaks as ordered except for me. It is now 8:45 and I am sitting there with a well done instead of medium rare steak. I tried to eat it since I was hungry but could not choke it down.  She came by to ask how my steak was and I said over cooked. She asked me if I wanted to have a new one prepared but honestly, after waiting over an hour the first time, no... I am not waiting again. Also, everyone knows what happens in the kitchen after you complain :}  Everyone will be finished before I even get my steak!!  So.. the next thing you know a manager shows up with a brand new filet. Overall, I will say the food was GREAT!! However, I expect when I am spending $500 on dinner, the staff better be polite, well trained,  and personable.",

We waited between courses for more than we should\u2019ve, waited in drink refills and had to ask for refills on coffee. We waited for a really long time after completing our dinner before anyone came to take our plates and byv hen it was too late to ask for dessert as we were leaving town after a long day visiting UF.   The food was very good but the service always affects the experience. Not at all what I\u2019d expected from a fine dining steakhouse.

He was able to change the reservation online to 30 minutes later without a problem.  I then decided to turn our date night dinner to a surprise dinner.  I called before they opened to change the reservation from 2 to 6 people.  The hostess was very nice and said it was no problem at all.  I then called an hour later to change it to 8 people.  Also no problem.  The hostess even asked how to recognize the person being surprised!  When my husband and I arrived on time to the dinner, the rest of the party had not arrived yet.  The hostess put us at a small table on one side and snuck everyone else down the other side.  When everyone arrived, the hostess told us someone wanted to say hi and that is when my husband realized it was a surprise dinner.  The food was AMAZING.  We had scallop appetizer, steaks, and a side of mashed potatoes.  I love this place.  The staff are always attentive and courteous.  I love the valet service right up front.  Thank you so much for everything your restaurant did for us last night.",

The service was great, but the food was ok. $12 for two crab cakes with about an inch diameter each, oyster rockefeller was good but the oysters had a slight smell to them no issues after eating though. I got the petite tenderloin Oscar style, the steak itself was extremely tender but was lacked much of any type of seasoning, it came with 3 pieces of asparagus, and the hollandaise sauce lacked much flavor as well. Overall I feel this restaurant could be great and may have been at one time but the food just tasted lazy and extremely under par for the price. I would highly recommend Embers off 34th if your looking for a great steakhouse in gainesville.",

We used to come here often, but we will be taking our business elsewhere. What kind business has a number posted for reservations, and a voice mail system, but won't return messages? Understandable if one message got lost in transaction, but more than that? Bad customer service. I understand you can book online, but not everyone has access. We had set aside a good amount of money to spend with you tomorrow night, but obviously we will be spending our money elsewhere from now on.",

He wanted a good steak and this place was recommend to us.  My dad had the Del Monaco and I had the Mixed Seafood Grill.  Both were excellent.  The seafood dish came with a buttery apple pineapple sauce on the side that was amazing for dipping!  When you go out for a nice meal and you're still thinking about it 6 hours later you know it was good.  I am not a food person but this place was damn good!  Next time we are driving through on i75 we will be pulling off for a snack!  Thanks guys.",
