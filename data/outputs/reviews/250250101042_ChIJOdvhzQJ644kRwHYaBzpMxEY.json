I\u2019ve only gone to a restaurant location once and it was great, but we order delivery often and every single time you guys are so sweet - you wait outside the car to make sure we get our food before driving off and send a friendly wave. Seems small but it\u2019s very appreciated. Thank you!",

Read the below... - food: mediocre - service: completely TRASH, the waitress (the Thai lady with long hair) specifically. She showed attitude both in service, as we told her we were short on time and yet, made us wait for the food for over 10 minutes. Also, she showed attitude when she \"assumed\" we didn't pay for tips, when we specifically told her the amount we calculated already included tips.... so we (a group of 4) ended up arguing and grabbing attention from the other tables. Also, mentioned above, we were in a rush, the argument took over 10 minutes of our time, while \"trying\" to solve the problem after our clarification, she talked to her fellow worker in another language. This is unacceptable, especially when we said we were in a rush and in general, unacceptable in front of customers. - sorry if this is harsh but I will NEVER step back at this restaurant anytime soon.",

Menu was outright deceptive; the bento boxes say that they come with soup, salad, rice, and fruit, but upon ordering one of these I was told it also came with fried spring rolls and (another item I can't remember), so I cancelled the order and got something else. However,  two others at my table ordered bento boxes, and they only came with soup (none of the other listed things actually came with it), and weren't even contained in a proper bento box.  In addition, the food was gross; the plates seemed to have random smudges of food all over them, and the fish made me slightly ill.  TL;DR: Menu is made of lies, everything else is of marginal quality.  Additional warning to people with allergies: do not come here.  Normally, as someone with allergies to dairy, nuts, and eggs, I've found that sushi places are the best at accommodating my allergies; the process of making sushi involves careful use and cleaning of ingredients, work space, and utensils. Here, this was not the case. Our waitress seemed annoyed when I asked about the ingredients in something I was planning on ordering, and I even got the idea that she didn't intend on doing it at all, so I politely reminded her a few times. Even then, once we received the food, the plates seemed to have random smudges of food all over them, and I had to send one item back because I found tempura flakes on it (tempura flakes had nothing to do with this dish, and are not safe for me to eat). I would not trust them again by any means.  TL;DR PT. 2: Don't trust with allergies.",

Then, simply asked if we could sit at a table near the front, but were told we could not; otherwise, we must wait in the waiting area until the table was set. The only table that was NOT set was another tiny two person square (2' x 2'). We were not \"allowed\" to sit at a larger table (per customer request) in what was otherwise a completely empty restaurant. Simply put, the man at reception was a being real a**hole. We left.",

Its a pretty good price, and you can tell its fresh so its pretty worth it.  The restaurant is classy and quiet, good for small groups or pairs, but probably wouldn't go with a large group.  Also I think their miso soup is one of my favorites in the city, which is funny because they're all kind of exactly the same.",
