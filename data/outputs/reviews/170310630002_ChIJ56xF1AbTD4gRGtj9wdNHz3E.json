But I ordered off door dash and specified for both orders that extra soy sauce was needed. When the order arrived, there were only TWO packs of soy sauce in the bag. It was not difficult to throw a few extra packs of soy sauce in the bag, especially when you spend over 30 dollars at the restaurant. Food was great, but I was disappointed with this and that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving two stars.",

Some of them where about 3 inch wide,almost in perfect  circles, and trying to eat them out of the container they came in is hard. I also ordered the vegetable rolls, this last one is a no for me.  Gave it 4 start for little things but this can honestly be a 5 star review if I give it another chance.",
