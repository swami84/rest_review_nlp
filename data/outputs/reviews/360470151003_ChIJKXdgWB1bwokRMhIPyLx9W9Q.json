Her snide looks and demeanor are better suited as a nightclub Bouncer.  And, the audacity of the management/owner to send their patrons next door to restaurant next to them. My parents own a small diner in Queens and i know full well the costs of water used for toilets and sinks. Plus the additional costs of soaps, towels, electricity and cleaning. Not a good look!  Stay away at all costs!",

I have been a loyal patron of Naidre's for a year and had been thankful thus far that is seemed to be a place to enjoy time with friends and my baby who I come in with at least once a week. UNTIL TODAY.  I find it a true shame that I was asked to get up from my table today...where I sat with my baby while chatting with two other moms and their children, drinking coffee that I ordered from you...simply because I hadn't ordered anything from the kitchen. Aside from the fact that I order lunch and coffee there on a regular basis. It was inappropriate to ask me to get up and essentially leave and certainly did not go unnoticed by surrounding customers.  Anyone who runs a business with integrity, knows that it's about how you make your customers feel at the end of the day. That all of your patrons should be treated equally whether you are receiving $1 or $100 from them. I would expect a coffee shop as progressive as you claim to be to know that and operate under such a principle.  There are hundreds of coffee houses in Brooklyn....in Park Slope alone. I would think that in trying to survive this economy and thrive in your neighborhood, adopting a welcoming energy for every customer would be a great idea. Especially a customer with a baby in the Slope.",
