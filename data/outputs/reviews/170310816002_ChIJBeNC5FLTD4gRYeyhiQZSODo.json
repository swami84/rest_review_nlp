My sub was made is a whopping 30 seconds which was great (that's not what I'm complaining about). The lady at the cash register around 2pm on 7/13/2012 took her time chatting with someone ordering a catering food order. The couple was at the end of their order as I arrived and it should have been taken care of. She never said \"I'm sorry for the wait\" and had no manners at all. I understand if the place is busy, but not when it's just me and another couple. This was terrible service and I'm sure there are more polite people out there that could do a better job.",
