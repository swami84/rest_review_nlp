Our favorite dishes were the clam special (I hope this dish finds its way to the regular menu because I would go back and eat it at least once a week)  the pork chop and the burger. The service was very good. The food came out really quickly.  If you want to guarantee yourself table you may want to book one on a busier night. It's nice to have another good restaurant in the neighborhood and to see a restaurant on Columbia Street doing well.",

I've probably had 4 or 5 different dishes from here and they are all unbelievable. Then to top it off, the manager Troy provides top notch service and he's just an overall nice and friendly person. This restaurant takes pride in their food and service and it all adds up to an amazingly pleasurable dining experience",
