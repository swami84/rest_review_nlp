I then went to order some food.  The lady who prepared the food was nice. I placed an order of fried scallops with french fries. I had my own water, so I saved a dollar on my order.  The food was good... I don't know if I was saying this because I was hungry or what.. I was HUNGRY!  After slathering ketchup on both my fries and scallops, while dunking the scallops in the tata sauce, I chowed down on the hot food before as if I haven't eaten in months!  After devouring my food and drank my water.. I felt (or at least my stomach felt full) Once I finished my meal, I noticed a cute little Asian baby running around in the place, just as happy as she can be, without a care in the world.. playing with her toys, building houses with plastic cups her mom gave her.  As I was putting on my coat to leave, she smiled at me through the mirror and said \"Hello\"  I then smiled back, and said \"Hello\"  After putting on my coat, the little girl said \"Goodbye\" and ran behind the counter to her mom. I smiled and said \"Goodbye\" and left.  My eating experience was quite lovely, especially when the innocence of a child has made it so much nicer.. #Amazing!",
