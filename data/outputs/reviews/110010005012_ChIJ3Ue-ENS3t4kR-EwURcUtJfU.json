I got there early before the lunch rush came in I suspect, just minutes after opening. The tables hadn't been set yet. That was how early. I ordered a Miso soup and a Fantastic roll. The soup wasn't ready so they asked if I would like my roll first. That was nice and I opted to do that. It was excellent. The special wrap and the plating made it visually so eye appealing that I felt bad eating it - to a point. Delicious. The miso was about on par with any other place and to do it again, I might opt for another starter instead. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely. Will I come here again in the future. Absolutely. Service staff were pleasant. Big bonus around here.",

In the driver's defense, there were signs that said \"No Parking\", but was still a bit annoyed as I had to go downstairs twice as he wasn't there when he called me the first time.

Good spot and I'm super particular about my sushi that I drove to Baltimore for my favorite sushi joint versus eating it in dc",
