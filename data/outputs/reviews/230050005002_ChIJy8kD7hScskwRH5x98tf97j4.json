I also believe in shopping responsibly (pro environment, social justice, local, etc.) So Sticky Sweet effortlessly ticks ALL the boxes! Compostable cups and wooden spoons. Very supportive of local, and actively promote racial quality on social. These sisters are amazing, and I'm so happy they are being met with such success. (Plus they are amazingly kind and have always treated us like dear friends even though we've only been in 3 times so far.) Now, the ice cream...HOLY WOW! Wonderful rotation of incredibly delicious and unique flavors (Butter Pecan Praline, and Chocolate Cream Pie blew my socks off last night - LOVED the cookie bits!) The cashew blended with coconut base gives it a creamy depth I haven't tasted in any other vegan ice creams. And the homemade waffle cones could be made into wafers and I'd eat them all day long (good thing they aren't.) I'm not big into desserts, so some flavors are a tad sweet for me, but others are just right. Meaning, I think anyone can find their perfect flavor here. The prices are simple and truly reflective of quality: $5 per scoop (1/2 cup), $3 mini (1/4 cup), $1 waffle cone.  As others have mentioned: Get there early as some flavors (or all) will sell out!",

Taste: Hard to tell that the ice cream is vegan/gluten free/plant based. The ice cream was creamy, decadent, and flavorful. My mom and I split a scoop of the Very Vanilla and the Cool Mint Cookie flavors and both were incredible. The Cool Mint Cookie had huge chunks of cookie in it!  Bottom Line: Highly recommend for all eaters, for those who eat a gluten free or vegan diet and those who eat anything given on a plate/cup/cone.  Edit: Went again and picked up Pineapple Cheesecake on a cone when I don\u2019t really love pineapple or cheesecake and was blown away by the texture and flavor once more. Had huge chunks of \u201ccheesecake\u201d in it!",

The waffle cones are next level, especially when they\u2019re hot off the press. Here\u2019s the thing, most vegan spots can get away with a very good coconut milk based profile.  The main problem is most of the flavor is coconut which can be a problem if you don\u2019t like coconut. But this spot has a interesting blend on each of their flavors.  Nothing can be pinned down on what alt milk choice they made. It\u2019s just so creamy and so delicious. We didn\u2019t even mean to go here, we just happened to be around the corner and we searched for ice cream and it was the closest place. I\u2019m so glad we stopped in.",

This version is a gorgeous, healthy Maine version. WOW. Tastier than any I've had in a Thai restaurant! They also have Blueberry or Banana versions. The lovely woman at the counter let me try all 5 flavors of their new Coconut/Cashew Ice Cream: Maine Maple Seasalt, Blueberry Velvet, Strawberry Jam, Cocoa Pudding and newest Latte with Speckled Axe coffee! All utterly creamy and rich, flavorful and delicious!",
