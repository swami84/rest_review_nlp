One took the lemon and olive chicken tajine and liked it. I took the couscous and was very disappointed.  First no lamb couscous, they serve beef couscous, veggie one or chicken one. The couscous and the meat were dry, not very tasty and I had to ask for some sauce. So you can go for the tajine but I do think the couscous needs some improvement.",

They also brought us some shrimp with chermoula; and they asked at the beginning if either of us had any food allergies, which we don\u2019t. Everything was so good!

I took a bite and couldn't resist walking in & I'm so happy I did. I was actually on my way to another restaurant to meet friends, but I arrived early, so I had a little time to spare. I have to say that the 15 minutes I spent at the bar conversing with the Bartenders/servers & enjoying my delicious pomegranate cocktail eclipsed the entire night I had with my friends at the other place. The dimly lit & intimate atmosphere coupled with the warm reception made me feel comfortable and right at home. I told my friends about this special little gem and we will all be coming to Mekki's soon!",
