They argued with customers, talked bad about them behind their back, gave dirty glares, and even told a customer to their face that they must not get out much. There was a group of about 15 friends eating there and the waitress put every meal and drink that was ordered on one check without asking. Then, they proceeded to tell them there was no way to change it and one person had to pay for the entire bill. The younger group sat there for about 30 minutes figuring out how they were going to pay while the workers sat back, glaring at the group and talking about how dumb they were. The food was good, drinks were overpriced, and I was just dumbfounded at how the employees treated their customers.",

It's a casual neighborhood place that's been around for a long time. Fried artichokes are yummy here too - tastier still if you order garlic bread with cheese. This place is one of my favorite spots for hearty, homestyle food, and a good place to linger over dinner with friends. Prices are reasonable, portions are generous, but not over the top. Service is friendly and helpful.",

Mario is the most familiar face when you walk in, and always there to greet you with a smile! The atmosphere is quaint and makes you feel like you are a local (even if you aren't). The food however, is a-ma-zing! Well, the pizza in particular is what we always order. It's a perfect thin crust, and has numerous different flavors that make you want to keep coming back for more! I can't say enough great things about this local gem, except that in the summer time they have a great outdoor patio which is perfect for people watching!",

One time there was an incredibly loud birthday party for an Italian fellow and we felt like our food and service was an afterthought.  Anyway, their food is good.  Except for their salads.  Get steamed broccoli instead.  Today we ordered a delivery order from them right when their website started letting us take orders - 3pm.  We put in the order right away, and my wife has to time out her meals as she is pregnant.  So we needed our food within an hour (we live very close).  I called them to check on our food at 4, and the guy laughs, LAUGHS, at me for saying that their website says they start taking orders at 3pm.  He says when his \"guy\" comes in, sometime after 4, is when they start delivering.  He didn't let me get a word in edgewise, and made it clear that I shouldn't hold my breath for our food.  He didn't address my issue about when the food was going to come.  He just laughed at me.  I didn't cancel the order this time, but I wanted to send a complaint to them.  Since their website doesn't provide an email address, I am posting my grievances publicly.  Just remember that these guys can be sleazeballs.  And get steamed veggies instead of a salad.",

We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and it arrived hot and delicious.  LIghtly battered and very fresh, some of the best I've had.  We also ordered a sausage and cheese, thin crust pizza.  I found it to be very enjoyable and tasty. Not overly spicy, but I added my own Italian spices. It was so good, I ate more than I usually would. I would eat here again the next time I'm in Chicago, the food and service were wonderful!",
