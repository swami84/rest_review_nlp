This was a major disappointment.  I ordered a large wonton soup.  The wonton dough was sooo thick and whatever it was stuffed with made me dump all of them after a first bite.  Wonton should be translucent with recognizable meat, seafood or veggies.  The shrimp rolls were tasteless.  My husband said his Green Curry Chicken was  okay, but I found it to be barely satisfactory.  If you're a traveling soul, as we are, your expectations of food differs from people who have not had the experience of traveling to locations where food quality is a priority all the time.  I will never eat there again, nor could I in good conscience recommend it.",

They offered to refund the soup and remake the order. The last thing I want is MORE food from a place that already served us bugs. It totally grossed my family out and we tossed the rest of the food. I understand businesses needing to protect themselves from jerks who try to rip them off, but I am not one of those people, and my Order Up order history can prove it. I'm very disappointed with how they dealt with this situation. I will never order from them again and I will recommend against them to everyone in the neighborhood.",
