We are taking pastries home and the constant traffic of regulars in and out for the pastries tells me i wont be disappointed... we will be back sooner than later.. thanks to the staff at Lombardos!!!",

We were seated quickly but it took a while for the waitresses to take our order and give us waters. We were trying to get their (2 waitresses) attention but they seemed quite busy. When one of them noticed us, she asked if we were ready, apologized and took our order. They have a very concise menu and they only take cash. The tax is already included in the price you see on the menu. We ordered the Prosciutto di Parma & Arugula. The pizza was perfection!! It was so, so good. There was enough ingredients on every slice. The bf and I finished the whole pizza (8 slices). I will definitely be back soon!",

We ended up ordering a margarita pie with pepperoni and a small calzone. The calzone came first and even though it says on the menu it serves 2 people. That thing was huge!! Pretty sure it serves 3 people and it was so good. The pizza was perfect when it came to us. The crust was crispy and the pepperoni was delicious. Highly recommend this place to try out.",

It maintains a cozy atmosphere so you can focus on the most important thing, the amazing food. Every piece of food I ate and saw others eat was amazing. It's as if each item you ordered is made with 100% love from a caring family member. The waitresses are super polite and accommodating. I've yet to have a bad experience and as the popularity of this pizzeria grows, I won't mind at all waiting in line to be seated to have any of his pies or calzones. The menu is straight forward with enough options to satisfy anyone. I've even tried pies that I wouldn't normally order but the chef found a way to make everything delicious. I would say the worst part of the night is figuring out what great pie to eat. As an added bonus, whatever I can't finish, I'll reheat the next day and it still tastes great. Lombardo's of Bay Ridge is already a landmark and staple pizzeria shop in a city full of wannabe pizzerias. I challenge anyone to be disappointed with there experience. Advice... get there early and get put on the list ASAP otherwise you'll be waiting. However, it's ALWAYS worth the wait! I met the chef and told him how great everything was and he was very appreciative about all the compliments he was getting from the other customers. He was busy the whole time I was there but took a few moments to talk and make sure we had a great time. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! Enjoy and bon apetito!",

The food was fine although I found the pizza better the first time around. The service was not great which was very disappointing. I didn\u2019t like something that happened\u2014the waitress that we had(there was only 1 waitress) was cleaning other tables, cleaning the chairs, and even picking up food from the floor then our pizza came out & I saw that she had that same rag that she was cleaning all that stuff with still in her hand while handing down our pizza to our table. I just feel that she should have been more careful with that. And they were not busy that day so go figure.  Another thing\u2014as my mom & I were leaving we said goodnight/goodbye to the waitress & the owners & workers there to everyone really. The only one who said goodnight/goodbye back was the waitress, which I appreciated. Meanwhile, I noticed the owners & employees say goodnight & goodbye to other customers as they left so yes I felt left out. It seems to me that they are only nice to some people and choose to exclude others. My mom and I have been polite both times we\u2019ve visited this place as well. I thought the owners here were nice & friendly people and treated others the way that they want to be treated but I was wrong. Sad but true.",
