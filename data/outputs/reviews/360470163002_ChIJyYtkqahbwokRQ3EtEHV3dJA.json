        "caption": "Very mixed feelings about our night out at James.  My partner and I went to enjoy a personal dinner. We were seated near a personal heater outside that was put on low on a brisk night, not much of a problem since we had our coats on but did not know it could go higher.  We sat and got our orders in quickly, yet we were reminded 30 mins in that our order was not effectively put in so that we would wait longer. An additional 15 mins pass, we were then served our hot dishes of pasta & broccoli first...then to be served later our salad dish. The dishes were clearly rushed based on taste but nonetheless tasty.  As clients we would have appreciated an acknowledgement of our wait, even if that included a 3$ cookie on the house for dessert.  Which we ordered nonetheless and was simply just a dry reheated cookie.  There is a 15% guaranteed gratuity, regardless of the service added on the bill yet our waitress still showed us the iPad if we wanted to add more.  We do not understand what the service industry must have suffered during this pandemic, yet bad service and just an organized evening for us doesn't justify it.  Wouldn't return just yet, yet wouldn't suggest to my friends heading on an intimate dinner.",

The heaters are barely warm, the servers don\u2019t open water or wine bottles, just drop them at the table with cups for you to serve yourself, and the food is served in take out containers with awkward little wooden forks. I had to ask for a proper plate and what was brought was a 6\u201d paper plate. All ordering is done via app. The servers just quickly drop things off and leave. The whole experience just felt cold and uninviting and certainly over the top if it\u2019s all being done in the name of Covid precautions.  Many other restaurants are still using plates and proper flatware in the very least. The food was good enough to return but not for awhile... once this is all over perhaps.",

But it was. First the one positive...the two service professionals who were at the helm that night couldn't have done more to make the best of obviously very challenging circumstances. Hats off to them both. Now the several downsides...at a place this pricey, you can't have any outside tables with no heat lamp. We had to move mid-meal after a covered table for two with a heater opened up. But this could've been forgiven had the food been special. It wasn't. For $95 per person prix fix, we got a small, luke warm, so-so trout dish (that was so smoked it could've just as well had been salmon), a tiny portion of short rib over a mash all served room temp/cold, and a mushroom dish with dried out rice and a missing ingredient of pecorino, also served underheated. The highlight of the meal was a large piece of chocolate pound cake, not because it was that good but because we were still hungry and it at least helped to quell the pangs. It was obvious that we were eating pre-prepared and pre-plated food that had been inadequately reheated. And the menu was wrong...a cold winter's night screams for hot comfort food. Again, service aside, we expected more from James, especially at these prices.",

        "caption": "I really debated about leaving this review, because of covid, and really tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, everything about our brunch experience today was at best \"meh\". I understand having to shift experiences around in having to accommodate covid regulations, and that's fine, but the lack of transparency, and frankly, outright exploitation is not ok. First of all, when I arrived shortly before noon for brunch with a friend, I was told that I cannot be seated unless I have a reservation (unbeknownst to me, my friend made one) - when I mentioned that the website didn't offer any option to make a reservation the lackadaisical response was \"yeah, we need to update our website\" - ok, it's officially 2021, why isn't that on your website already?  Now, mind you, it's 27\u00b0 F outside at this time, none of the heat lamps have been turned on yet, and all the chairs are made of metal - yeah. Turns out, most of the ceiling-mounted heat lamps in their outdoor huts are too far away to actually warm anyone up, so fail to see the purpose or expense of keeping them running - whatever. They offered to bring us some blankets, which were actually quite nice and made all the difference in helping to tolerate the outdoor cold.  Now, because of covid regulations, you're expected to scan the QR code at the table to load the menu - and then place your order for \"pickup\" on their chownow restaurant store, and indicate which table you're sitting at when you check out. Yes - you're expected to pay in advance for your order. Sure, we get it. Makes sense. Between the two of us we ordered a cup of coffee, the Little Gems salad, Market Greens side salad, and a bowl of their Creamy Polenta. The coffee arrived first, lukewarm, and only 2/3rd full, even though I specifically did NOT check off \"extra room for milk\" - which they brought out in a tiny little plastic sauce container you would normally expect to find ketchup. Nothing else came out - no spoon/stirrer, no sweetener of any kind - ok. I politely asked if they have a spoon or sweetener they could bring out and received a reluctant \"ok\" scoffed at me.  Now, the polenta was pretty good, enjoyed the texture and the chive pesto-like topping, overall, would probably order this again. The Market Greens side salad was fresh, if somewhat bland.  The real kicker, however, was when they brought out the Little Gems salad, which we specifically ordered because the menu description indicated \"crispy sunchokes\" - very much in season now. This salad was priced at $15. The salad that was supposed to be the Little Gems that we received was just the larger version of the Market Greens they brought out, for more than double the price. When we went searching for the sunchokes, we couldn't find them! We asked our server about it, they went to check, and then came out with a little plastic container filled with pepitas (not in the salad) and explained that the kitchen was out of sunchokes so they brought the pepitas instead - bizarre! This salad is NOT worth $15, especially without the sunchokes - otherwise, it's some fresh greens, sunflower seeds and olives. Nobody mentioned they were out of certain ingredients and nobody updated the ONLINE DIGITAL MENU THAT TAKES 2 MINUTES TO UPDATE to reflect the menu change (or the price, for that matter).  After we finished brunch, we felt the need to say something to the manager who began with all kinds of excuses about why we had a poor experience and why the salad was lacking a crucial ingredient. We countered that the expectation was set, and the restaurant was already paid, and they did not deliver what they advertised. As an act of atonement, the manager offered to make us another salad....and low and behold - IT WAS FILLED WITH THE CRISPY SUNCHOKES. What?!? This is shady af and a total exploitation of the clientele who patronize this establishment. Unfortunately, because of this shadiness, I will not be returning to The James. You have an obligation to be and do better - and instead of being honest, you were shady.",

I ordered the Little Gems Salad which boasted sunchokes as the standout ingredient, and bc of COVID paid up front with mandatory service.  The salad came without sunchokes - basically just a green salad. When I mentioned it to the waitress, she said they are out and brought me some pumpkin seeds instead.   On my way out I told another staff I was disappointed and he said the manager could offer me another salad, but it will still be without sunchokes. I got the second salad and surprisingly sunchokes manifested on my salad!  This whole experience seemed dishonest - offering what you don't plan to provide, taking money for what you don't plan to provide, not letting the customer know...and then reverse! Magically providing what should have been provided in the first place.  COVID accommodation: The heaters don't have any effect as they are hung super high. The blankets are excellent.  On the bright side, the greens were fresh and I got two salads.",

The waitress asked to order quickly because they are going to close the kitchen soon. During our lunch, she asked us if we want a last drink for the same reason. Finally, they switched off the music, and she brought the bill even if we didn't finish our plates. She came back to take back the bill, but of course, we wanted to finish our plates before to fill the bill. This attitude is super rude and not respectful, much more when you pay more than $30 for a burger and fries. We definitely won\u2019t come back. The service at James is worse and worse.",

I can't begin to describe how exquisite this place is, in every way. Gorgeous interiors. Massive floral arrangements brush the ceiling. Tall quilted leather booths. Candlelight throughout. Small, personable, incredibly warm and friendly vibe. The menu is perfection... Hard to decide, but had the scallops in watercress sauce with a side of parsnips, and the flourless chocolate cake w/ rosemary ice cream. Rosemary ice cream! It's just... James is just so exquisite, warm, and magical in every way.",

Service is great. Your typical hip Brooklyn restaurant decor. 10/10 would recommend! One pro tip, if you like ice cream. Skip dessert, and head to ample hill right down the street.",

        "caption": "Longing for the days of a homey meal and genuine customer service  This week I enjoyed a milestone birthday.  I went back to my childhood neigborhood in Brooklyn to celebrate.  Prospect Heights has grow a bit over the decades and now is dotted with more restaurants, ice cream parlor and boutiques.  We landed at the James Restaurant, a quaint neighborhood spot with a menu that would rival many artisanal restaurants but a wait staff with the skills and manners of a Tasmanian devil.  First the food.  As we settled into our meal we were met with a mix bag of flavors and quality in preparation.  The chefs strength is meat not seafood.  The meat dishes (burger, hanger steak and short ribs) were seasoned, cooked and served to perfection.  By contrast, the seafood dishes we overcooked, dried out and lacked flavor (octopus, trout and scallops).  Next up the service. Over the course of the meal, the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant was marred by spotty service and the ruddiest, most unprofessional and non-attentive wait staff.  As the first customers seated for the evening, we hungrily watched as the first seating of guests ordered, ate and departed.  When we asked about our meals,  waitress was belligerent  and instead of checking in with the kitchen about the food decided it was more important to discuss us with the other wait staff.  When asked again about the food, the waitress threw more shade and when confronted about her behavior made excuses through a thick layer of attitude. While the tense conversation was defused with our slender dirty blond waitress, the staff's posture afterward was to avoid the table and artificially add the gratuity to the bill.  \ud83d\ude15 yes the entitled, ill-mannered waitress was unhinged from reality.  After shutting down gratuity surcharge down, my party departed and reminisced how we longed for the old days in Prospect Heights when you could get a delicious homey meal with a side order of warm and welcoming customer service.  I would not recommend this place.  With so many culinary gems in the neighborhood, service is a critical marker for setting these \"gems\" apart.  And, based on our experience with the slender blond waitress, the service at the James Restaurant is epically poor and warrants avoiding this place.",

It took us an hour and a half to get our entrees while multiple tables that ordered a good half hour after us got theirs earlier.  We all ordered fish so there was zero reason why it would take so long.  When the food finally came, it was cold!  The manager came over to us twice yet offered no explanations.  To top it off they failed to offer to take an appetizer or drinks off the bill (which came to $150, so it's not like it's a cheap bad experience) or even offer free dessert.  This place has no sense of decency to acknowledge an error, yet still serve cold food after so long and ultimately do absolutely nothing about it.  STAY AWAY!!!",

We were told 20 mintues when we walked in and they kept telling us five mintues more every five minutes so we would not leave I guess.  I had a very water downed bloody marry while waiting, I would not recommend that at all. Finally they sat us down and brought us the food we already ordered while standing at the bar. By then it was 3 pm, they finish lunch/brunch at 3:30 so I belive they wanted us in and out quickly.  I had the angus burger, the meat was average,  The French friez was way under cooked. Shame really to serve it in such condition, as it looked promising. The servers were busy wrapping up the shift, it was challenging getting their attention for a glass of water!  I assumed that since we waited patiently for around an hour they would wave the drinks we had while waiting to be seated but unfortunately  they even made us pay for the cup of coffee that one of us orderd.  Not sure I will come back, not impressed!",

First two times there was an insane wait (like an hour) and since the place is on a residential block it's not convenient to pop over for a drink nearby to wait, plus they don't take reservations. I would like to give the bartender six stars. Terrific cocktails with great attention to detail. I enjoyed the meal and the food was very good, but it didn't blow me away. Plus, somewhat overpriced (eg \"small plate\" of ravioli had exactly ONE ravioli, though large, was fifteen bucks.) Hence, overall a four star. I would certainly return because it's very close to where we live, but need to go at off hours.",

The garlic-oil roasted chick peas are a new favorite, and the grass-fed Angus burger lives up to its reputation and value. The neighborhood - and those locals we met while relaxing at the bar - charming. The James beautifully complements that charm.",
