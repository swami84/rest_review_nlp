One thing we noticed while we we were waiting to pick up the food was that the place needed a little TLC...the floors looked and felt a little sticky and the walls also needed a cleaning",

Let\u2019s start off with the drinks. They charged us 2 dollars for a fountain soda. We thought that was ok. Until we saw them poured it in. The size of the cup was smaller then kids cup size at chunky cheeses . Only 6 oz to be exact. Next we go to the sliders. The chicken was super dry and barely any spicy sauce. Very disappointed with this location. Please support the location in elmont which actually makes fire sliders. Avoid this location !!!!!!!!",

I won\u2019t be getting this again but will definitely come back and try something else on the menu since everything else looked fantastic.

Exactly what I wanted, but, admittedly, it's exactly what I expected (and wanted). The fries, though, were an exception. They were delicious. They had what appeared to be a light breading, and, by my god or yours, they were exceptional.

The patty was dry, and worst of all the \"brioche\" ban was like plastic. It would slip away from the burger and stick to your teeth, making it tough to cut it even when you bite quite hard. Finally, the coke was nothing like a coke. It was more like seltzer water - yes I'm serious. All that for $17... There was a group of friends eating at the table next to me who were only taking pictures for fun. I could see they weren't impressed either. And before getting my order served I heard one of them say how the coke was bad. Those who say this place is good have never eaten a real burger I'm afraid.",

Took an Uber to reach the place. Very dingy and un clean. Ordered classic burger, chicken burger, holy dog and the holy burger with fries and shake. Nothing was outstanding. Once at home, we had bought frozen Creekstone burgers which is a halal brand out of midwest. Tasted same. Nothing fresh about the patties. French fries were the only good thing on the menu. Btw, killed a cockroach on the wall next to us. Back table was next to toilet, and ahem, the smell was not pleasant. After all the stress on cleanliness and wudu in religion, dunno when halal stores will catch up. Sorry guys, but just so disappointed.",
