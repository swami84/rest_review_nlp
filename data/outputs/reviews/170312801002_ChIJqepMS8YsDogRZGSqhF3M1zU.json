Their menu changes all of the time so you get a variety of foods to try from week to week. The options vary from healthy foods to 'comfort' foods and they charge by weight instead of by item. I kind wish that since they charge by weight you made your own platter, but that's my biggest downside. Just be very specific to the person working that day how much you want of each item and they will do their best. The food tastes home made and get there early because sometimes they run out of the good stuff before 12:30!",
