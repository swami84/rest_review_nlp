In addition to dishes that are so delicious and surprisingly complex, the refreshing collection of beers brewed in house pair perfectly with every meal, regardless of which brew you choose. I personally love how the lemongrass and jasmine notes provide a fine tea experience to beer drinking. With the addition of super friendly and highly knowledgeable wait staff, this place is easily one of the best restaurants in Chicago.",

Definitely take advantage of that deal. I got the michigan getaway which was a saison with cherry and star anise. Did not get cherry notes but the anise was prominent, like root beer. I wish the saison was tart as this just tasted like an ale to me as I was expecting some tartness.  The burger though is what I really came for AND DID IT DELIVER. I have been searching for a burger better than au cheval and was hoping this would be the one. The aged cheddar was great and the caramelized onions really elevated this burger. Also the bun was fantastic as well, so soft and whatever was on top of the bread is great too. They bread was perfectly toasty that added a nice crunch to each bite. I'm personally not a fan of the thicc patty burgers but still a magnificent burger. If you like kuma corner's style of burger, this one is a must try!!!",

Management and the hostess invisibilized and dismissed me as a costumer. Management had an opportunity to be solution-otiented and honest, but chose not to. My experience before dining was stressful and onerous. I had a patio reservation for 8:00. I called 25 minutes prior to my reservation and told them me and my party of 2 were running 10 minutes behind. They said it was okay. When I arrived at the restaurant at 8:10 they said the table was still occupied even though the occupants had surpassed the maximum 2-hour time they could spend at a table. I patiently waited because they assured me that the occupants would be done in 5 minutes. 10 minutes later, I checked in to get an update (the entire time my friend and I didn't move from in front of the hostess podium and there was a guy not wearing a mask in the common area and no one said anything). They said the same thing as before. After 30 minutes of waiting and asking in 10 minute intervals. I was ready to leave, but there were no other restaurants in the area that had outdoor seating and that was important because we're quite conscious of COVID. Couldn't go home because we were celebrating my friend's engagement. After 30 minutes, I suggested a seat in a vacant area of the restaurant no thanks to management and we dined. There were so many customers that I saw get treated with respect and attentiveness that made it apparent that the treatment I received was because I was Black. I will not be dining or recommending this place to anyone.",

One of my friends got the fried rice. It was a perfect small portion and tasted incredible. Kimchi Mandu's are definitely a do. The Half order of the Ssam plate is perfect for sharing between 3 people. Bottom line, don't sleep on this place.",

The drink list was a good size without being overwhelming. The beer list is about 2/3rds house-made beer and the rest a selection of interesting guest pours. The Unspoken Rule golden ale was easily the winner amongst their own beers, while a Salted Cucumber Dry Cider from Stem Ciders was a real showstopper on a hot summer day.  The cocktail list was small but effective,  offering a delicious half dozen original summer cocktails each focused on a different liquor, as well as two frozen options that looked great.  The food was the real winner though. A long list of small Firsts will tempt you with a wide range of options, followed by half the number of mains. You'll probably want a First and Second per person.  The Shrimp and Crab Dip is a must, though, served with beautifully full and perfectly crisped wonton chips for scooping up the herbed dip and catching some of the sweet chili oil in the bottom of the bowl. We also tried the Chicago Beef Bao, which I found underwhelming; it came across as a pretty straight and somewhat uninteresting Chicago beef sandwich shoved into a really mediocre bao bun.  For the Seconds, the hot oil noodles are a killer bargain. One of the cheaper options on the menu, it comes in a large bowl filled with a large mound of this massive coiled noodle soaked with flavorful oils and decked out in all sorts of delicious toppings. It has some heat that quickly builds over time, but nothing prohibitive or painful, sticking the landing in that perfect zone where your taste buds are being pushed to the edge and you can't stop yourself from wanting to get closer and closer.  The pork belly was a real winner too, arriving gorgeously cooked and scoured. Cutting into it, the texture is heavenly with the right mix of meaty resistance and pillowy fat, but the flavor of it all mixed with the sauce at its base make for a truly sublime dish.  Can't wait to go back and try more things.",

        "caption": "Such a fun instagramable place for brunch! I had made reservations for 4 of us and then expanded it to 6 with no problems. Easy to make the reservations online. We were seated immediately for at a long table in the upstairs room. The upstairs room had a glass roof so it was beautiful to get to see the outside but it was a pain after awhile when the sun was shining down directly on you. We had all checked in on Yelp and had gotten the free beers which were a pleasant surprise. They have a good selection and mix of light and dark beers.  For the brunch portion, they have some great options but okay options for vegetarian. I was surprised at how rigid the menu seemed to be (for example, the noodle dish could not be made vegetarian). For our vegetarian counterparts, they got the bubble waffle, kimchi mandu, the eggplant bao brunch, the fried rice and beer bread. It was a good amount of food but did leave people feeling hungry a few hours later. For those of us who ate meat, we had the lamb wontons, the classic breakfast and the drunken noodle. Great dishes and I would recommend the lamb wontons for sure and also the BEER BREAD (this was AMAZING).  The reason why this place stayed at a 3 star for me and not a 4 star is because despite the atmosphere, I did not think the food was elevated to an asian fusion status but rather just asian food. Also for the quantity of food, definitely priced more than it deserved. A few reviewers have also mentioned the employee insurance fee which I wasn't a huge fan of. I am all for employee insurance benefits but I do not think that it is at the responsibility of the patron vs the employer. I think it is quite tacky to have it added to my bill. The option of opting out is to \"ask your server\" but that just seems rude. At the end of the day, 2% does not make a huge difference in my bill and if I can help out a hardworker, I will gladly do so. But to have the dishes priced highly and then on top of that, have the 2% already added was a bit of a turn off.",

I loved a Jasmine tea beer (Golden Rule) which was light and so easy drinking with the mellow flavor of Jasmine throughout. My finance loved a beer brewed with Mango and Black tea, which we took home a growler of ($24ish) It was very slightly bitter with delicious notes of black tea and mango. We tried all of the brews they make in house (except the one IPA on tap, as we are not fans) and liked every one. Full wall of spirits if you'd prefer a mixed drink as well as guest taps and frozen cocktails! There was a good size dining area and a bar that runs the depth of the space. We did not eat but the menu looks incredible! Seafood tower!! There is an upstairs party room that can be rented I would assume. Male, female, and, unisex bathrooms available downstairs. We can't wait to go back!",

Also their red bean pancake is the bomb!  Update: the spicy chicken sando is BOMB. Think spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's sprinkled with magic fairly dust and accented with a creamy sauce and sharp, bright notes from the pickles. 10/10 would sando again.",

They cover all the bases - sours, ales, lagers, stouts, each one great. Plus, you get a free check-in from one of their drafts. The atmosphere is sophisticated with white tiles and black accents but the vibe and food offerings don't necessarily match, which is a very good thing. I loved the plant accents as well, which brought the tone down. As for the food, it's typically a dim-sum kind of fashion, but our table did a more \"get your own meal\" and everything was great. Drunken noodles, eggs, fried rice, it was all hot and flavorful.  The not-so-good: A little price and the seating was a little uncomfortable for our particular booth, but neither are much to complain about. And, the house-made sausage wasn't particularly to my liking.  Food/drink: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 9/10",

There was a few I would buy a crowler to go, but mainly the beers were well matched for the food.  Wife and I shared a flight of all of them.  Definitely not cheap.  Cocktails were well made.  Didn't try them all, but tasted a good sampling.  The slushie one I had was good, will want more during summer.  The belt noodles are kind of their specialty.  I recommend getting them.  Probably my favorite dish.  Whole fish was just ok.  Lots of other places around town have similar dishes.  Bixi's sauce was a little tired.  Lamb wontons were fantastic.  Would eat again.  Crab spread was basically denconstructed crab Rangoon. Good but meh.  Kimishi fried dumplings were quite nice, is eat those again.  All in all, some good menu items, a few meh things that could be reworked or tweaked to make special.  I'll be back to try more though.  Good addition to the area.",

We are here for my cousin's birthday, all excited abt the Asian fusion food. Here are some of the issues:  1) food size: in no world, Asian or or otherwise, would anyone sell ONE bao for that price point. That's terrible.  2) food service: we ordered quite a bit on the menu and when the food arrived, frites were cold and when we pointed it out, they said they were out of fries and don't have a microwave to heat up the fries. Yes.  A restaurant ran out of fries and don't have a microwave. Also, our order of siu mai never arrived even though we reminded them. Also, their Vietnamese coffee is thin, cloyingly sweet and merely ok. So expect overpriced food,a small quantities and the possibility that they food don't arrive or arrive cold. The egg tart, bao and scallion pancake did taste good, just to be fair  3) PRICE ON MENU DIDNT MATCH CHECK: I was really ok with all the issues above. But what really made my blood boil was that the prices on the menu didn't match the check. We had 2 items that were overcharged. You would have expected that with all the issues above-we did respectfully share our feedback- that they would savor the last chance to turn the sinking ship around. But nope. They took 3 dollars off and called it a day. Then the manager had the audacity to say, hope to see you again. Maybe it is my fault that a restaurant would go out of their way to fix it - maybe they are having a bad day-  but it was disappointing, that they didn't care. So please check your checks. You may be overpaying without realizing.  In sum, don't bother coming. Food is mediocre, they may charge you more than what is stated on the menu and the value of money is poor. Stay away.",

As a SE Asian, I was trying to ascertain specific information to decide between dishes to order. Also, the long singular noodle dish (awesome, tasty, concept), failed in execution due to WAY too much oil in the bottom of the bowl. An unnecessary amount of oil ruined the overall mouth-feel and taste of the noodle dish. The potstickers were good, you get 4 in total (forgot to picture). My friend ordered the vegan soup, not impressive in flavor. Would we return? Yes, probably for the beer and less complex food. Nice ambiance inside, and a cool black and white city skyline mural behind the bar!",
