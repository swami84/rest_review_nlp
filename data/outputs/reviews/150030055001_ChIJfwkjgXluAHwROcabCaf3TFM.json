The food was so amazing, I ordered the drunken clams which in my opinion is a must have! this place is worth stopping by. So many chicken, and delicious fish dishes among other things to choose from.",

On this quiet residential road, this small pavilion stands alone on the dark roadside, and the bright lights are particularly conspicuous. On Sunday night, at 7:30 in Hawaii, most people have already had enough food. It should have been a low tide of restaurants. There are still people waiting in line here.  The little sister-in-law went to drink the wine, and the five sisters tired and went home to rest. The boys were wonderful, and only four of us were driving alone to find food. A journey of only a few weeks, if the same restaurant eats twice, of course, there are some people. I have had a dinner dinner recently, and I immediately look at this small, inconspicuous small restaurant. I regret that I didn\u2019t take a photo.  The amaranth here does not seek to break the grid, does not engage in creativity, and does not have all kinds of noble and rare ingredients from all over the world, and there are no strange cross-border mixed dishes. Cantonese cuisine is Cantonese cuisine, only practical, only delicious, all the dishes on the menu are ordinary ordinary Cantonese dishes. Cantonese cuisine is most focused on suffocating, and this aspect is not eclipsed. And the taste is very delicious. After the last time, I have not been thirsty after going home for a long time. The service is very thoughtful. I have met these several conditions. I really don't know what else to ask for?  There are only four people tonight, and I have a four-course meal. I have to be pointed out by the high-ranking people. Anyway, the rice is almost a bowl of two mosquito chickens. Several people eat together and order \u201cthere is a meal\u201d.  Ginger onion Salt and pepper ribs Mei Caikou meat XO sauce prawn fan \u7172 Salted fish, chicken, fried rice  The three women are not necessarily a market. Just add me, and it is inevitable that the food intake will be smaller. However, the things here are really delicious. In the end, I actually took four dishes and one sand shovel and cleaned them like a mirror. Even after the meal dessert, purple rice sugar water, are not sloppy, real material, delicious and delicious. No more nonsense, you already know the things here. Moreover, with a particularly high standard of living in Hawaii, the price here is still very popular, economical and very cost-effective. Have the opportunity to travel to Honolulu, although try it.  .

Probably the only place in Honolulu where I felt I could experience the kind of Cantonese dining experience I remember from San Fran, Vancouver and even Toronto. The menu is not Westernized as in many of the other \"Chinese\" eateries around town. We called ahead and asked them to cook a whole fish that we picked up at the fish market in the morning and the happily obliged our request. BYOB is another perk some restaurants around town offer and we were able to select perfect pairings to the menu we were contemplating. All in all a fine and memorable dining experience",

When we finally got a table, we didn't know if we were supposed to walk up and order or what the deal was.  So, honestly, the first 15 minutes, I was pretty over the place. We managed to order and got our hot tea so that was the start of the turnaround. Then, our food came out and, seriously, they do food well here!! We got the Won Ton Soup (for my cold, I wanted a soup and it hit the spot), Char Siu Fried Rice (sooooo good!), Steamed Fish (because we love fish!), and the Drunken Clams (served cold which I didn't expect, but still so good).  Paying our bill was as tricky as trying to find the hot mustard dishes and placing our order, but eventually you get someone's attention. Parking can be tight, but we got lucky. I highly recommend trying to make a reservation, if you can. Or order takeout which it seemed a lot of people did.  All in all, would I go back? Yes, for sure. I honestly can't wait to order other things that people rave about. It's definitely a gem.",

For the price you pay, this dive would have earned an 6th star if Google offered it. This is one of few Cantonese style resturant you will find on Oahu that takes you back to the motherland. They must use a very well fired up wok because you can taste that distinctive flavor in their dishes. My only gripe about this place was the tight parking in the back or on the street and very confined dining space. If you plane to eat here, call in advance (like a couple of days before) to reserve a table. Wear something light weight since it could get warm in the restaurant. Finally, bring a Cantonese speaking friend, that person will be very helpful when you order. Man, still thinking of them pork chops!",

We had to park behind the building and walk up to see that it was in fact there. It is a small restaurant but homey. Two of the teenagers with us are picky about food and we had to explain that is is served family style so not everyone is picking an option from the menu. The 4 adults picked one entree each for the 9 of us plus we picked two appetizers and rice. When the food arrived it looked delicious. It all tasted as good as it looked. You are given chopsticks for your meal but can ask for a fork as my 5 year old did. She is still learning chopsticks. Everyone enjoyed the food, including the picky teens. We ate almost all of it except for some of the fried rice that we took home with us. We didn't leave hungry at all but very full. The water served with the meal was tap but tasted very good. They offer soda as well if that is what you prefer. It seemed to me a very authentic style Cantonese meal. Great place to go to try something new. Not too far away from Pearl Harbor or the national cemetery. Very worth the drive. Affordable too, under $100 for everything.",
