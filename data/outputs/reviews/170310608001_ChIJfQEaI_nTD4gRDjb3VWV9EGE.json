Prepared enough fries, asks if you want the coleslaw (sometimes they just provide the coleslaw regardless), mild and hot sauce very clean. This place definitely uses clean grease, good chicken and very fresh bread to guard the sauces and grease from going through the bucket that the food comes in. Would highly recommend this to anyone on the north side (or if you're not from the north side and are in the area). Only downside is parking but it is a small thing to overlook for great food.",

This was our first time coming in. We were able to take our time, ask questions and get help on what to pick for lunch. Even as we left the guy that helped us chased us down to give us our coleslaw. That's some awesome service right there. I tried the chicken sandwich which is amazing and a small thing of fried livers which were also amazing. Food is made to order but we waited no more than 10 minutes. They do have safety precautions in place. I highly recommend this place not only for the good food but for the friendly service, which makes all the difference in going to a restaurant.",

When the staff member called the owner to ask what should be done, the owner basically said, do nothing because they can't give out food since another truck won't be coming for a while. I am truly appalled at the lack of customer service. The restaurant would not give us our food or money back due to a mistake that they made under the advice of the owner.",

I don't understand how you can state \"filet\" when you have bones in the fish.  I also just called to try and place a take away order and lady let me be aware I would have to pay for it \"over the phone\". I have never heard of having to pay for for food over the phone when I'm going there to pick it up.
