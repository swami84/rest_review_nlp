I decided to give them another shot, since the sandwich was free. I ordered my sandwich at 11:43am and waited over 45 minutes for my delivery. My office is literally two blocks from the Jimmy Johns.

I didn't want the delivery guy to wait for me since they seemed busy, so I went downstairs right away to the first floor of the dorm I live in. I waited for approximately 45 minutes with no word from them. I called them again to confirm that my order was on the way. The guy that picked up said that \"it was PROBABLY on the way.\" Alright... So I waited for another 30 minutes. I got tired of waiting, so I called one final time, and it turned out, my order was voided for some reason?? At this point, I'm starving, so I'm pretty annoyed. Well what happened was, one of the employees inputed my phone number incorrectly, and as a result, they were contacting a different person who had nothing to do with my order. I did not get my sandwich unfortunately. The manager was pretty nice and professional about it, which I appreciated. This is why I gave a 2-star rating rather than a 1-star rating. I also ended up receiving 10$ dollars in store credit. I'm just disappointed that I wasted about 1.5 hours of my time for a very simple mistake they made. However, I realize that everyone makes mistakes, so I really hope they don't make this same mistake again. And I do really like Jimmy Johns sandwiches in general, but I am hesitant to order from this specific store location again.",

A group of friends and I decided to take a quick study break, to get dinner. We ended up going to jimmy johns where one of my friends ordered a turkey sandwich without tomatoes. Instead he came back to our study area with a sandwich without any TURKEY. That is right a turkey sandwich WITHOUT turkey. We decided to call and tell the MANAGER about the situation. We requested they deliver  the same sandwich with turkey on it this time....It was raining and we felt it was a reasonable request. The MANAGER said she would have the sandwich on the way. Without asking for a number she hung up...RUDE. Keep in mind  this was a 10 min walk so maybe a 3min drive. After an HOUR, we called again. We ended up talking to the MANAGER again and she said she was sorry but the never got our number and THREW THE OTHER SANDWICH AWAY. They eventually brought the sandwich but honestly this is just not okay. Also we didn't get a refund nor any other form of compensation beside a bag of plain chips. PS They INSISTED on getting the other sandwich back! I know what you're thinking, but not this is not a joke, this happened.",

This should have been amble time to prepare an order of this size for delivery. On the evening of the party, we had requested the food be delivered at 7:15pm. Around 7:30pm, we called and they said it was ready to go but they were busy. The delivery driver finally showed up around 8pm with the sandwiches only...no chips and no pickles. He said he'd go back to get those items. The delivery driver came back with 20 chips and nothing else...we were still missing 10 bags of chips and a bucket of pickles. Upon calling the store and requesting to talk to a manager, the phone was put down and someone was yelling profanities about my husband \"coming at him like that...\". Another person picked up the phone and said they would apply a $20 credit to the account. That is simply not sufficient for the terrible service we received, not to mention a third of our order was paid for and not received. Tried to contact Corporate and they said it was sent to the store, but I have heard nothing!",

I called and ordered my sandwich for delievery and they got the address wrong (which was forgiven because it was so loud in their store) so when the driver called, I corrected the address. I then proceeded to wait 30 mins before getting a call from him and was hung up on. Then I called the store after waiting for over an hour and the manager was extremely rude and unprofessional. She was disrespectful and condescending when I asked if I could at least get a discount on my sandwiches. She then, after arguing, finally said I would not be paying for my sandwiches and they\u2019d be made fresh and sent out to me ASAP. I then waited 40 mins and there was no word from them. My friend then called asking about my order and the same manager hung up on him. Waited two hours for my sandwiches and then they closed and I never got them. Less then one star experience here.",
