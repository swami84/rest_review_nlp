The pistachio ricotta was uncommon and interesting. The must have I would say was the Nutella sfogliatelle, one of the best I've ever had. The real italian chocolate hazelnut spread was used, not Nutella. It turned out that was the only pastry made by the owner in his kitchen! How cool is that. In any case this is the only way you can go to Italy from downtown so don't miss it!",
