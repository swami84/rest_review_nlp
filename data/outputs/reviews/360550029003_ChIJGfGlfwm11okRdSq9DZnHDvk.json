However, on arrival the first person I encountered at the bar seemed very disinterested and referred me to 3 girls nearby who were engaged in conversation and finally one of them escorted us to a table in the center of the restaurant area which was not an area I had requested.  Nearby was a table of 3 persons who were engaged in very loud conversation.  We requested a change in table to a quieter one at the end of the seating area. The noise from said table was still extremely loud and distracting for anyone trying to have a normal conversation.  The acoustics are nonexistent.  We we're with friends from the Netherlands and the atmosphere did not make a good impression.  The waiter was friendly but also loud.  The food was excellent and we were pleased with our choices but the noise interfered with our conversation.  Bread was not included and we paid $2 for a very small loaf of bread.  Two persons in our party order Irish Coffee which as presented in a coffee cup.  When we commented on this presentation the waiter remarked this was the way the owner made it.  It was also over priced $10 per cup.  In spite of the food being good I would not recommend this restaurant due to the many issues mentioned above and would not plan on returning again.",

Max and his team contributed to a perfect dinner for our daughter's wedding. It will be memorable to all of us.

When I was finally able to flag her down, it took until I was done with my food to get my refill. When she refilled my coffee she completely ignored the rest of the tables need for refills and needed to be flagged down again. The seating was atrocious and the staff was poorly managed. At least the food was good, after they finally brought out certain items they forgot and needed to be reminded of. Only getting 2 stars because the food was good and the price matched.",

        "caption": "Our waitress Kate too 15 minutes to come to our table, when there was no other customers except at the bar. A table came in about the time she finally showed up, and she served them first instead of us. The food took a bit which honestly isn't the problem, I work in food, I understand. It's when she brought me my food and told me they don't have the fruit to go with it. Which wouldn't have been a big deal if she had offered something as compensation, but she didn't. Then I asked why I didn't get the side of home fries, and she said it doesn't come with it. She said it was stated in the menu, but it only said pasta and pancakes don't come with home fries. And you could make the argument that french toast is in the same family as pancakes, but I think it should be clearly stated in the menu like she said it was. Everytime she came over  I could see the attitude in her body language, which is extremely unprofessional, especially in our line of work dealing with the public. At least the food was good, but overpriced...$10 for 2 pieces of French toast and in her words, \"just a small bowl of blueberries\"....would not recommend",

We weren't warned before hand that the dining area in the back was unpleasantly hot. The waitress opened windows after commenting on how hot it was but that didn't help much given the fact that it was 90 outside. A little disappointed in the dining experience, food was good though.",

There's something for everyone, the menu is extensive.  Didn't get anything to eat, just drinks. They IDd everyone, very play-book. We sat at the bar by the window overlooking the street.",
