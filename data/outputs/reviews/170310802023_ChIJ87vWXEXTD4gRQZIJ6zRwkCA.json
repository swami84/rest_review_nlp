We arrived for dinner at 6:10 pm, quickly ordered our main entree and after finishing our dinner (right after receiving our bill) the owner came up to our table and hushed our 2 1/2 year old and said he had to keep it down because there were 2 guests sitting by our table (a father with his late teen or college age daughter). First of all, our son stayed seated in his high chair at all times, he was playing with his own toys and never made any sounds with his toys, the plates nor the utensils. He wasn\u2019t squirmy. He wasn\u2019t even watching videos on a phone nor iPad, which I think the background noise in those gadgets tend to be annoying to other people sometimes. The whole time we were there, he never made a mess with the food, never fussed and didn\u2019t even cry. He was in a good mood and we were so proud of him for behaving so well and for eating his meal. After finishing his meal, he got excited and asked for candy (referring to the mints he saw by the entrance). He never screamed he just asked by raising his voice, but nothing louder compared to the chatter and music going on in the background. Do you think a 2 year old has a powerful voice? He wasn\u2019t even having a tantrum... he was simply excited because we had promise him that if he ate he would get mints and he just asked for \u201ccandy\u201d 2-3 times after finishing his plate. The people by our table never seemed to mind, they kept talking between themselves throughout the night without staring at us. But somehow, Mario the owner decided to leave a sour taste to our night by hushing our son and the telling us he had to keep it down. Mario, the bill was standing right in front of your face, we were about to leave anyways... do you really have to treat clients like that? That is rude and disrespectful. We were about to leave and you decide to make a scene over a little innocent and powerless voice that was just asking for candy? Ridiculous owner. He probably never had kids and if he did they probably didn\u2019t even like him. If you do not believe me, please go ahead and read the other negative reviews written by families with kids and you will get a sense of what type of person Mario is. Bottom line: I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone that has CHILDREN. MARIO, if you don\u2019t like kids, then do not offer kid\u2019s menus nor crayons you STUCK UP. And please, don\u2019t be a hypocrite and start greeting families when they come in, specially if they are accompanied by their children. We don\u2019t need you to FAKE your intentions.  All you want is the $ and when you are about to cash in the receipt, that is when your true colors come out. KID\u2019S HATER.",

We were in complete and utter SHOCK by how uncomfortable and regretful he made us feel. If you have children take my advice and go to other GREAT Italian restaurants in the city of Chicago such as Carmine\u2019s or Lou Malnati\u2019s. Don\u2019t waste your time here if you\u2019re bringing your precious children, you don\u2019t want to hear what we heard from Mario should your toddler act like a toddler. Mario stop harassing your customers with kids and learn how to be a human. Because of your comment I\u2019m NEVER coming here again and NOT RECOMMENDING to anyone.",

The owner told us that one year-olds keep their food on the table at his restaurant and then called the busboy over to pack up our remaining food to go. Thank you to the couple next to us who were so shocked and angered that they insisted on picking up our check (totally sweet and unnecessary).",
