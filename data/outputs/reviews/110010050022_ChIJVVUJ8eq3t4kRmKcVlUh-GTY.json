It was the best meal we\u2019ve had since the start of lockdown and we\u2019ve been ordering in a lot. The saag paneer is great, the raita was delicious, the samosa papdi chaat was class. We also got onion bhajia; we thought we\u2019d never find them in the US after a few failed attempts elsewhere so it was sooo good to find them here, definitely order those.

Unsurprisingly, it was a little more expensive than I think it deserves. For instance, naan is extra and you need to pay $3-4 for ONE piece of naan (vs paying for a few pieces); feels as if the restaurant is taking advantage of the 14th area and clientele. We ordered tiki masala, lamb biryani, palak paneer (side order size), and naan and all were tasty and definitely enough food. I would definitely come back but would be mindful of what i am ordering if anyone is on a budget!",

I lived here for a long time, then moved away, but I was able to return this week for a visit to friends and family while touring some new spots that have popped up since I've been gone. Pappe is one of those spots and WOW am I glad we made time for it. I'll start with atmosphere - hip, laid-back, and clean with tasteful decor that is at once theme-appropriate without falling into appropriation. Staff is attentive, fast, and friendly even with relatively large groups. Whatever happens, do NOT miss out on the naan bread - there are several varieties, so make sure to get a basket so you can try them all! Garlic is my favorite, but the butter version is very helpful for highlighting the amazing sauces and curries without detracting too much from the flavor. It comes with a sort of green cilantro/mint chutney which is delightful in its own right and certainly has a little bit of \"attitude\" if you put too much on your bread. We ended up ordering the chicken tikka masala (of course, since it's literally everyone's favorite), the fiery chicken vindaloo, the aloo tikka chaat, and the shrimp malabar. I'll start with the aloo tikka chaat which was refreshing and had a very fun flavor profile, not unlike a divine love child of ceviche, hummus, and samosas (but with a completely unique approach). I expected it to come as a sort of sauce to put on potato pancakes, but it's actually more like a bowl you serve yourself out of and eat with the potato pancakes already at the bottom. Definitely a winner. Of the three entrees, the chicken tikka masala was exactly what you expect it to be - tried and true and easy for folks who are relatively new to Indian food (we aren't - we just love that dish). The shrimp malabar was my unexpected favorite - creamy, generous, and full of complimentary flavors that brought out the best in everything around it. However, I want to go on record and tell everyone to #respectthevindaloo because I certainly did not at first so I was face-first in the basmati rice and water glasses for a minute afterward! I am usually one that is very welcoming and adventurous with spicy food, but this one caught me off-guard. We ordered it with chicken only because one of our party did not eat lamb, but I expect the lamb would have been even better than the chicken. However, be warned that it is definitely a dish that is aptly named and not among the merciful dishes for folks who are sensitive to spices. However, it is absolutely delicious! Enjoy and be sure to share!",

The staff said it was the condensation and there was nothing they could do.They were not able to reseat us for an hour, so we left.",

Both were overwhelming amazing, but I had to dock a star for two very basic things that were easily avoidable and brought the overall quality of the experience down.  First, the rice was dry. It was very unfortunate because it was very fragrant and otherwise good tasting, but dry rice just kind of ruins everything. Second, I found two small bones in the Butter Chicken. Not the end of the world, but they were of a concerning size because they could be a choking hazard.",

But a recent dining experience will never make me go back again.  I left my phone in the restaurant and realized as soon as I got home, roughly 10 minutes after as my friend had driven me back. Once I realized, I was able to contact my boyfriend to have him call the restaurant. I used my Find My iPhone which located the phone at Pappe. He called twice, and in those calls, the restaurant claimed that they had not seen a phone, that there were two people dining where I was sitting, and that they would \u201ccheck later.\u201d  Instead of waiting, I simply went back to the restaurant. 40 minutes had elapsed since I was last there. No one was currently sitting where I had been sitting, and in 40 minutes, were they really able to clear the table, seat another set of guests (it wasn\u2019t busy on a Tuesday evening), and clear their plates as well and swap with new plates and silverware? Then, it took me demanding to see a manager for someone to give me back my phone - I don\u2019t know why it took 2 phone calls and an in person visit to actually \u201cfind it,\u201d when it should have been found immediately because it was left on the seat. This is super shady behavior by the employees here and is so disappointing to see in an established business - a place you think would have a lot more integrity and a lot more care for its customers.  Food is great, but be wary of the service. Looks like from other reviews that other shady behavior has been going on at Pappe.",

The person who greeted us was rude and unwelcoming, and instead of walking us to our table, pointed to it several times to indicate we should walk over ourselves. It felt like we were intruding and this already put a bad taste in our mouths (we had a reservation!). Then, it took an extremely long time for any server to take interest in us. In fact we were seconds from just getting up and leaving when someone finally stopped by. Disappointing! I won't be coming back - especially because the food is on the pricier side, so one would expect service to match.",

I was disappointed to hear they won't be serving lunch anymore, but would definitely recommend going for dinner and trying everything possible. Everything I tried did a great job of balancing flavor and heat, and I liked the touch of complimentary unlimited masala chai. The place is beautifully decorated and I was happy to see it so crowded on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Pappe makes a great addition to the 14th St family and I'm glad to have such good Indian so nearby.",

Place is nice enough, exposed brick and industrial style with ornamental pillows/curtains/and what looks like saris overhanging tables. Out of place looking bar right in the middle of the restaurant. Service was ok. Thought we were getting a free starter - turns out they just delivered it to the wrong table. Didn't see a waiter after being seated for a fairly long time (15+ minutes). Waiter forgot our drink order - have us a free drink too compensate. Not terrible, but not amazing. Food was hit or miss - yogurt explosions were fantastic, samosas were dinky/wimpy for what you're paying, and the portion sizes run a little smaller than I was hoping for the entrees. Pros were that the mushroom truffle naan was the star of the show, so good. Chicken in the chicken Tikka Masala was perfectly cooked and the curry was great - strong, savory, spicy; there just wasn't enough of it to warrant $17. Other entree we tried was aloo gobi (potato's and cauliflower) - not good, weak flavor for the cauliflower, seemed as if they were tossed into the small amount of curry at the end. Rice was dry. Presentation wasn't anything spectacular (except the yogurt explosion - those looked great). Overall, middle of the road food experience. Tldr: If you're going to go here, start with the yogurt explosion, get the mushroom truffle naan, and have the chicken Tikka Masala. Forgive the rice, and steer clear of samosas and aloo gobi.",

Literally ordered half the menu and not one dish wasn't wildy enjoyed by my date and I. The garlic nann, AhMayZing. The crab cake sliders with buns so cloud-like soft with meaty lump crab cakes and the right blend of spice, AhMayZing. The crispy shrimp, AhMayZing. The butter chicken and fish curry, AhMayZing. The house cocktails, AhMayZing. And the best part, the prices are not ridiculously inflated like so many restaurants on 14th. For two and as much as we ate and drank our total bill was under $100, that's almost unheard of in the DC restaurant scene these days. So if you love Rasika polish and refined scene, check out  its cooler kid brother rocking out amazing food had the right prices because I already want to eat here again. \ud83d\ude0b",

The fact that you're a paying customer deems you respect and genuine hospitality. Then there's Pappe. On a Friday afternoon during the tail end of lunch service, my wife and I walked into Pappe. The hostess was on her iPad and it took a minute for her to look up. She looked annoyed we were there and just looked at us forcing us to ask if there was room (obviously, there was room! Literally there were three other people in the room). She acted like we were the biggest inconvenience to enter the restaurant. Okay, everyone has a bad day, so perhaps she just needs the weekend to rest.  We were seated near the window and we waited. Ten minutes passed. Twenty minutes passed. Finally, we approached the hostess asking if a server was assigned our table. She annoyingly walked to the back to check and informed us the server was getting plates for us. We waited. Five minutes. Fifteen minutes. Nothing. My wife then took things into our hands and went back to see where our server was. Five minutes later he came rushing to our table and said, \"Are you in a hurry or something?\" Maybe he was awkwardly trying to play it off, but in a hurry or not, waiting for 30+ minutes to be acknowledged at a allegedly top restaurant is just rude.  Once we were finally served, we ordered lunch and that did come out pretty fast. My wife ordered the shrimp curry with onion naan. It was decent, but not the best Indian in DC (for that go to Huntington to Dishes of India). I ordered butter chicken, regular naan and mango chutney and I was impressed. It was the best Indian I've had in the city of DC with the exception of the naan (it was just okay). The mango chutney comes in a healthy portion and tastes like red pepper flakes and honey, making it unique and very tasty.  We waited for our bill. Waited some more. I then grabbed the waiter and handed him our card. All in all, the food was good if you order the butter chicken, but for the service, we're unlikely to go back. A three star rating is for the delicious butter chicken, nothing else.",

The side of rice on the other hand was disappointing- dull white instead of fluffy snow-white grains. It was \u201cjeera rice\u201d, instead of the pulav mentioned on the menu.

Maybe we ordered a couple subpar items and it was a bad night, but I was let down by the service, drinks, and dessert.  I should say that the entrees were great. That's most of a person's meal and if you don't stray from that you should be golden.  But the cocktails were too sweet - sometimes cloying. I was very excited for the rum drink with curry leaf. Until I tasted it.  The saffron rice pudding was passable but  none of us could taste the saffron. The carrot cake had something on it that the staff insisted was fruit but that I swear tasted like Parmesan cheese. They comped that when we asked why they'd put Parm all over it (which I appreciate) and brought us a new one with as little of the Parm fruit as possible, but we didn't eat it.  I'm cutting it some slack because they just opened. Hopefully they can work some of the kinks out.",

The servers still getting a hang of it. But the food is off the charts good.  We had a few different starters, and each was awesome. The cauliflower starter is incredible. Perfectly done.  The cocktails are really good.  The main dishes, we had 4 or 5 and each was superb. The kitchen staff here have to be congratulated for the amazing fare.  This place is going to have to be on the regular rotation. Great addition to the local scene.",

It did not disappoint. Even though we went during the soft opening and they claim to still be working out the kinks, this place was great. The service was very good and staff were kind and knowledgeable. Cocktails were delicious as was the food. We had some standard favorite Indian dishes such as palak paneer, chicken tikki masala, and vindoloo. Everything tasted great. We will absolutely be back, and are thrilled to have a tasty Indian place nearby.",

        "caption": "TL;DR - Amazing food and drinks, great service and comfortable seating - easily one of the best North Indian fares I've experienced in the US.  Tried the Tandoori Gobi and Paneer Achari Tikka - the marination on the gobi was exquisite and the achar (Indian pickle) on the paneer transported me to a Dhaba in Punjab! The green chilly naan is a must-have for those seeking some of that Indian heat and the Missi Roti is a wonderfully unique addition to the menu. The Malai Kofta came highly recommended and we were not disappointed - people in our group who were not fond of koftas (dumplings) ended the meal craving for more! The drinks were great as well (even a basic mojito tasted brilliant) and the service was incredibly attentive and prompt (our waiter took the time to keep our toddler entertained and ensured we were well taken care of). Extremely chic ambience with comfortable seating and every area of the restaurant was kept sparkling clean. Prices are generally very reasonable for the DC area as well. If you're in the DMV region and love Indian food, Pappe DC should be in your top 3 restaurants to try out!",
