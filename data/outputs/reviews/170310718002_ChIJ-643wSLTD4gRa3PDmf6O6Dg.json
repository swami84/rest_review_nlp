The portions are substantial, well-priced, and full of flavor. Pork chops are a favorite as is the seafood linguine. The ravioli pasta dish was delicious and substantial. Beware: pace yourself! It's hard to resist the complimentary bread. And, save room for the desserts, though I had to skip the Tiramasu this time. Staff and service are incredible. From the time you enter the place until you leave, you are a special guest, no matter how busy they get. And, the kitchen staff deserves kudos for providing so many fabulous meals to a full house geared up for theater. Don't even think about coming here without a reservation!",

Wanted to try something different. I got Hand-made Fazzoletto which I never heard of. Hand-made Fazzoletto with mussels, shrimp, calamari, octopus, zucchini, tomato pesto sauce. YUM!! It was so interesting but delicious. It had pasta on the bottom that looked like a sheet. Then the toppings inside. Then another sheet of pasta on the top. The pasta was good and the seafood was perfectly cooked. I think I would have likes it even more with a white sauce instead. The red sauce wasn't amazing. Kind of overpowering.",

Walking into the restaurant, the ambiance was dimly lit, noise level ideal, and d\u00e9cor exquisitely crafted to provide an authentic Italian feel.  The wait staff was extremely knowledge about the menu, as they described the dishes in superb detail we had question on. They were also attentive, cleaning off dishes promptly, and ensuring your glass was never more than half empty. Each dish we had, from antipasti to dessert, was outstanding. I highly recommend the Roasted Eggplant to start, and the Grilled Beef Tenderloin for an entr\u00e9e. Overall, a top-notch restaurant to which I will definitely return.",

Super friendly guy to talk to while I was waiting for my family to show up.",
