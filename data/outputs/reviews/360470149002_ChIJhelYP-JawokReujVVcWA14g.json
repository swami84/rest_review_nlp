Take my advice and order the tapas (chef tasting menu) which is a combination of 15 plates being served on a warming plate, quite inexpensive, and will easily fill two people. The fried banana dessert is AMAZING!",

Frankly I was grateful they delivered to me in the first place, especially during lockdown.  The next day, the owner called me to tell me she had remembered that morning about the missing item and insisted on redelivering it! In addition, she included a whole extra (very yummy) dish as an apology!  Looking forward to having the Rijsttafel and much more on the menu when they reopen!",

The food took a long time to come, they were low on staff so it\u2019s understandable, (we arrived around 7). The soup we ordered came barely hot, though it was delicious, we could\u2019ve definitely enjoyed it more if we weren\u2019t slightly shivering or if the soup was hot. Then came our food, my mother ordered the \u201crendang\u201d beef, it had a pleasant aftertaste though the beef was way too overcooked and had become stiff. My sister ordered the, I\u2019m really bad with names but here is my recollection of it, crispy fried chicken with a hot and sour sauce. This was surprisingly good. I, unfortunately, ordered the \u201ckalio ayam\u201d  which took a little bit more time to cook, when it arrived , the chicken was rubbery and I had to really force it in. After paying more attention to it, I saw that part of it was raw.  This wasn\u2019t the best of situations. So my final verdict, the food\u2019s concept is really good, they have an idea of what to make but they don\u2019t know how to make it. I suggest you call before and ask how long you would have to wait for your food to make sure you don\u2019t end up in our situation.",

I mean, 10 tables. All done by the old lady, while her daughter in law was cooking the meals  Got to love it. But might need to reap the benefits of an amazing restaurant and hire someone for weekend nights. It could deter people that don't have 3 hours to sit and finish a meal.",

The food is delicious, I'd really suggest trying the lumpia, the sweet and spicy sauces combine w it really well.  And the Garada drink just became my new favorite weakness. It's like drinking in a summer vacation on the beach. The atmosphere is something I would really recommend for date night - the dark panelling and chandelier make it feel really romantic and intimate. It's not huge but it's cozy, sweet. Probably good to catch up with you friends too - I think I saw tapas version of the menu, though I haven't tried it. But seriously friendly comfortable restaurant w well made food.  Confirmed!!! Family restaurant here for 26 years and the owner ( one of the cooks too) is the SWEETEST lady.  Seriously, check this place out, it's adorable!!!",
