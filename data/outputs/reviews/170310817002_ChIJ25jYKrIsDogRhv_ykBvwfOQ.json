But among all the restaurants in Chicago do not come to this one just because it marked as Michelin 1 star. Whoever gave this star to this diner clearly doesn\u2019t know the standard of being a Michelin-star restaurant, nor anything about Mexican food, nor how a restaurant should serve customers properly. We went there 2 years ago and were asked prior to our main prix fixe experience came up that \u201cwould you like to start with some nachos?\u201d And guess what, they would keep the nachos coming even though you didn\u2019t ask for it, and when you finished it, it\u2019s $9 PER SERVING PER PERSON. The BEST PART is, they wouldn\u2019t tell you that unless you find that out on your check. Nobody tells you that, your server certainly doesn\u2019t know how to say that to you. Would any Italian or American restaurants charge their baguettes and butters? Would any Asian restaurants charge their fortune cookies? So good luck with some hidden charges because obviously they make money through those charges otherwise I don\u2019t know how they can still be alive! Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because those food that the chef made was innocent.",

They also included a link to a video with playing instructions, and a link to an accompanying Spotify playlist.  This was not a ready to eat menu, every course required preparation and plating, but that ensured high quality and freshness.  Every course was great in its own right, but the ceviche and the cr\u00eape cake stood out as absolute highlights. My only complaint is that the piece of cake was very small...

I put the exclamation marks in because this was like no take-out I had ever experienced. And it wasn\u2019t just the food; the thought and care that marked our experience started with ordering on the website, the emails from your team making sure that they understood our order and the efficiency that that greeted us when we picked the order up.  The excellence carried through to the packaging of the meal and the heating and plating instructions.  The food deserves its own paragraph.  As impressive as the logistics are, the food was some of the best I have ever had.  But the piece de resistance was the Spotify code that delivered your playlist to our dining room. It is so rare that excellence is achieved at every step.",

That work of art gave us a  360 degree  view or everything. It felt exceptional. Let me remind you, we haven't had a morsel. Reaffirming my decision, next bubble, what a great decision.  We were  there to celebrate 3 birthdays: my birthday, my husband's and a friend's.  Topo was on my friend's bucket list along with meeting and marrying celebrity chef Rick B..  Couldn't help Gwen with the marriage proposal not to mention, he's married. So I agreed to make recommendations.  She adores Rick: she owns his books and  watches him on TV.  Me on the other hand, know  little about Rick or  his restaurants. So when I tell you  every bite was  amazing, every sip incredible and every encouter with staff superb  trust and believe.   We had the seafood tasting abd my husband had the Topo tasting both excellent choices.  And we met Rick Bayless. Who can ask for more. It's a night, I'll never forget. BTW it was my first seven course meal. The food just kept coming. It was a perfect evening and a  wonderful way to celebrate my 55th, Gwens 69th, and Tom's 62nd birthday. Highly. Highly recommend Topo.  Thank you Topolobampo for helping us celebrate!!!",

Having dined at other Byaless restaurants, I expected good food and better than average service given the 1 Michelin Star rating.  The 5 course menu featured some excellent attempts to pay homage to famous chefs in the Baja region, where Chef Bayless spends a lot of time.  A great idea, however, I must say I walked away a little disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed in one particular thing, but overall, the experience didn't reflect what I've come to find from one Star restaurants, let alone the talent of Chef Bayless.  A few things we noticed:  The food was fairly well presented (a few mistakes on presentation included one dish with avocado crema on the lip and outside of the bowl - which I take to mean it wasn't inspected before leaving the kitchen), but overall the food wasn't anything special.  We were both a bit shocked.  The service was neither quick nor attentive - and I wasn't expecting it to be super fast - I understand that many people want faster service for lunch, which is why Chef Bayless offers the Lunch in 60 menu, but we were OK with taking a longer time to savor the tasting menu.  Even so, it took 2 1/2 hours for 5 courses of a few bites each (the amount of food is small which isn't a problem as long as it's exemplary).  That's a little too long.  Another observation: my water was empty 3 times for at least 5 minutes on two occasions. Again, too long.  The wait staff were never rude, they were polite, but plates and utensils were removed by reaching over the table, in a haphazard manner, and they were placed in front of us with a thud and a very cursory description of the dish.  To wit: one dish has river rocks on the bottom for effect - it would be very easy for someone to think that is part of the dish and for them to take a bite - but the server failed to point that out.  To sum it up: a good effort, but overall a disappointing experience.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't Michelin Star quality.  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't Michelin Star quality.  Honestly, I wouldn't go back, I'd rather hit up Frontera Grill...the food is better, and you'll pay less.",

The service was outstanding except for a wait in being seated. The food was excellent. The tortillas were handmade on the spot. The ingredients were high quality and the variety of the chef's selection allowed us to taste a little of everything. I will definitely be back!",

It was overly salty and basic. The only dish that was decent was the dessert. I would recommend not wasting your time and money at this restaurant.

I didn't receive my first drink until 20 mins after I let my waiter know I was doing the 7 course tasting menu w/ wine pairing.  My 2nd course of food arrived before the wine did. I waited to see if anyone would bring me my wine, but unfortunately I only received my wine after I asked for it.  The server (not the same gentleman that was my original waiter - my original waiter was very knowledgeable) that brought the first few plates did not know all the ingredients in the dishes - he failed to mention that there was uni in the first dish, and the 2nd, 3rd & 6th courses he was turning the plate looking at what the food was and listing off the ingredients as he turned the plates. When he brought the 6th (1st dessert) course, he literally did not know a single ingredient. He was playing with the cutlery trying to remember, I was embarrassed for him. It was pretty bad, so much so that the table beside me made comments after he walked away on more than one occasion joking about how he didn't know anything about the food.  My 4th course also came before I received my wine pairing and the table beside me had to flag down a server and ask if I could get my wine pairing.  It was 945pm when I received my 4th course, that's over 2 hours after I was seated. Tables of 4 that were seated over an hour after me finished their meals well before I did. As I was by myself, I ate each course of food pretty quickly. Yet my meal took 3 hours. THREE HOURS to serve 7 courses to a single person on a Wednesday night. That is really ridiculous.  I was extremely frustrated and the only reason that I did not complain to management that evening was bc I simply needed to leave the restaurant so that I did not ruin the dining experience of the other customers. While everyone that I encountered was really nice, the quality of service was severely lacklustre. I've worked in the food and beverage industry for over 16 years and this is by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had in recent years.",

As I rubbed elbows with the diners beside me, literally, I realized that they got their food way earlier than we did (ordered a good 10 minutes prior to them).

We picked \"The Classics.\" I do have to say that the Sopa Azteca was probably the best soup I've ever had in my life. Overall execution is excellent and presentation is beautiful. Be prepared to be very, very full! One major thing to note is that the menu we picked was clearly thought-out from a \"lightest-to-heaviest dish\" POV, but by the time the fourth (and heaviest) dish came, it was just too much. The short rib did not need the steak, and that entire dish did not need mushrooms with a rich sauce. (That short rib was nothing short of amazing, though. AMAZING. Melted in my mouth like butter.) The entrance is very confusing - it's shared with the Frontera Grill, so make sure you go in there in order to get seated. You're walked into an area with sliding doors that feels like you're transported to a secret world.",

The plate that was there on the table had some stickiness on it. The ambience was alright at best. Now all of these things seem a bit picky, but if you are going to spend 200+ dollars a person you want to be treated to the whole dining experience.  From a food stand point, generally everything was very good but there was no single bite that blew me away. I do enjoy the uniqueness he brings to the Mexican cuisine and will state there is nothing I have had that is similar to it. Nonetheless, there are many 1 Michelin star restaurants that are a 3rd of the price and just as enjoyable with a better ambiance. Overall, I would not recommend unless you have money to spend and are out of new places to try.",

The only dish that stood out was the carne asada which was cooked to a perfect medium rare, although the mole sauce that accompanied it felt unnecessary as it took away from the taste of the meat. Nothing else on the menu was memorable, which was disappointing given the one michelin star rating and the steep price. I would rather return to a restaurant like Boka which also has a one michelin star rating but with better food, value, and service.",

I came here with my parents and wife as a celebration and a semi-nostalgic homage to my youth. As a young chef around 13 Rick Bayless with his restaurants were on the forefront of my culinary world. We sat down as a family and had probably one of the top five meals of my life at Frontera grill. I can still taste the fresh fried cheeses on the epic appetizer combo we ordered. Fast forward to today and we go back and try the fancier side of the wall. Service was amazing. The waiter was talking about mushrooms growing on corn stalks that farmers were throwing away and how they turned those same mushrooms into a fine dining element, SOLD. 5 stars to ceviche trio that we had! My parents craft cocktails were a huge hit. Only dissapointments were mole (whole table agreed slightly bitter) and felt like mushroom quesadilla could have used a little more acids as a cool salsa to cut through the richness. Desserts were fantastic. Overall a great dining experience and we even saw Rick walk through the kitchen, HOW COOL! For now I am thinking we will check out the more casual side of the wall to hopefully revisit more of my childhood memories.",

Rick Bayless is a culinarily genius and one of the most memorable meals of my life was the tasting menu my (now) husband and I experienced 10+ years ago. I believe Deann was the sommelier and doing the pairings at the time. With great expectations we made reservations months ago when I learned my work would be bringing me back to Chicago, and we chose the art-inspired menu. Once we were seated we had two different people welcome us and then we were left for 20+ minutes as our wine and water glasses ran dry before anyone came to check on us. Once the 7-course tasting menu started we had the sommelier present our first two wines - but when the third course was served (beautifully) we didn\u2019t have the wine pairing and had to ask two separate servers to find the sommelier to serve our wine. Our wine was then (eventually) poured by another server with no description and our dish had already gone cold. From that point on it seemed like we were an afterthought. Very little service, very little interaction and a rotating group of servers and staff. Love Rick Bayless, but a $600 dinner demands both exceptional food and service. Maybe we hit on an off night, but we were looking forward to this for months and it was so disappointingly sub-par.",

I loved every dish and the wine pairings were perfect. I loved the enthusiasm of the servers and sommeliers. They knew so many details about what you were eating and drinking, where it came from, and why it was selected. This is one of the few places where I'm eager to try things I would otherwise never order. Trust these chefs; with Rick Bayless leading them, they know exactly what they're doing!

Value is very low.  Unlikely you will spend less than $300 per couple.  Compare that to Band of Bohemia which is closer to $200 and both are Michelin stared.

This is truly the upper echelon of Mexican cuisine, but priced like any regular, run-of-the-mill upscale restaurant.  Value for money? Oh, hell yes. You absolutely get what you pay for. Thankfully you get what you pay for without being gouged because it's a big name chef's place.  Verdict: best Mexican place I've ever eaten at between Toronto and Tiajuana from a pure skill-in-the-kitchen standpoint. Then the level of service and the ability to execute timely on drinks, apps, mains, and snacks for a table of four different personalities and palates just takes it well past the line of \"I feel like paying I'm a bit more, but at least I'm getting what I paid for\" to \"damn, I spent more than I'd've at a basic taco joint and got a truly 5-star meal experience for only $30 more than I'd've spent at the taco joint\".  Can't wait to get back. Even if it's all the way from Toronto to there.",

We both loved the idea of combining art with food. So the experience was 5/5. The food on the other hand - was beautifully presented but my wife and I found the Mexican style food doesn't mix well with french cuisine fusion. The ceviche shrimp tasted a bit too soggy (almost falling apart) - this art theme was called 'betrayal' and we joked that visually it was beautiful..but  the taste was betrayal.  My wife had to substitute that course with the cow tongue taco and that actually was the best tasting part of the entire meal (would eat it again!). The third meal was fairly good (pastry with peas and egg) . The tile fish was very fresh and nicely cooked. The braised beef+sticky rice that followed was the tastiest meal overall but overly salty (and I normally love salt). Next came the 'squab 3 ways' which had foie gras, the leg of the squab (with the claw)..this tasted very 'gamy' (if you took deer and magnified it 10x gaminess) - if this is not particular to your taste, then you may not enjoy it (or if you're a vegetarian then you might as well rule this place out). Next came the desserts - the chocolate ice cream with spicy around it didn't blend well although it was meant to be a fusion of two unlikely things that were supposed to combine into something wonderful, but spicy ice cream wasn't what we personally appreciate.  Lastly the cloud  looking dessert was nice but I didn't expect sprinkles on a michelin dessert..but after the spicy ice cream, the sweet flavors were welcome.  Overall this was our first michelin experience but after the experience we preferred to enjoy the rest of our trip at non-michelin star restaurants. The experience was wonderful though.",

Once he explained to me how the menu worked (you can do 3-7 tasting courses with the option for wine pairings) and I saw that they have a $35 margarita (it has gold leaf in it) I realized what we were getting into, and everything went above and beyond my expectations.  Our reservation was for 5:30, and we were promptly seated. After our waiter gave us a tour of the menu, we both decided on the featured 7-course menu celebrating the Chiapas region of Mexico, and I also indulged in the wine pairings.  Each dish was presented beautifully, and both our waiter and the manager were extremely knowledgeable and attentive. We didn't finish our meal until 9:30, but all four hours were a completely awe-inspiring experience. If you have the funds, I would definitely recommend doing the featured menu with the wine pairings.  While I'm going to reserve this for special occasions, I will definitely be making a return visit to Topolobampo. And maybe next time I'll try the Splurge Margarita :)  My fianc\u00e9 brought me back for my birthday last year, and it was just as beautiful of an experience. Our server, Chiago, was fantastic, giving us in depth descriptions with each course and wine pairing, and also providing us with numerous and wonderful cocktail recommendations. All of our food came out in a timely fashion, and each dish wowed us. We were greeted by both the sommelier and the manager, and they all wished me a very happy birthday. Our server was also very knowledgeable and patient when it came to answering my many questions about everything from how a specific dish was prepared to Rick's personal art collection.  Overall, the whole night was an absolute delight.  My only wish is that I had more room in my stomach and money in my wallet to visit Topolo more regularly.",

I could elaborate on how poorly each dish was conceived and executed, but that would mean I would spend more thought on this tasting menu than Mr. Bayless did. Moral of the story: we had seven courses (that took three and a half hours sitting in a chair that resembled a stool with a hula-hoop for a \"back\") of overly spicy and completely savory dishes. I've never had a ceviche that lacked any note of citrus or brightness, but Topolo pulled it off! Everything else tasted like various iterations of liver + mole + tobasco. Maybe their a la carte menu items are tasty?",

        "caption": "Service was way off.  Missed on pacing of dishes and made mistakes on 2 items.  My wife is a pescetarian and we requested no other meat on the plate.  They missed chicharron on one plate but delivered my dish while they went back to get another for her, 5 minutes later. Then brought 2 of my wife's dishes half way thru and ended with 2 meat dishes for me.  My wife was given a glass of wine to compensate.  After not having any drinks or even a water refill for ~10 minutes, they brought the wrong beer and then said \"no problem\" to me when I asked for the one I actually ordered. The restroom situation downstairs via a back staircase thru the kitchen is sub par for a 1 star restaurant nominated for a James Beard award.  On the plus side, we did like the look and feel after the recent renovations.  And the quality of the food is still excellent.  Being local in Chicago we have thoroughly enjoyed all things Rick Bayless (including a tour of his home garden) and routinely visit his restaurants around the city.  Very disappointed in our most recent experience but we plan to try again in the not too distant future.",

Well, let me explain....As my party and I was being escorted to our table, I almost ran into him and I froze...with a big smile on my face! He smiled and said Hi & Thank you! IT WAS AWESOME! I LOVE RICK BAYLESS, so the fact that I saw him while in his restaurant about to embark on his culinary genius, meant the world to me!  So how was the meal & the whole dining experience.....AMAZING! I had the Classic Ceviche appetizer then my entree was the Wood fired pork quesadillas and lastly for dessert the Sopa de Frutas which is like a fruit soup.....everything was wonderful! And all for a great deal due to Chicago Restaurant Week, it couldn't get any better; unless I would have met the man who made it all possible....oh, wait I did! LOL! I'll be back again as well as his other cool restaurants!",
