I also ordered a chicken Biryani which was a very small portion.  To make things worse, they had pieces of chopped tomatoes in a biryani! to likely cover up how bland the rice was.  Have never seen that any where lol.  Save your money and pick up some real Indian food from a place that will give you a good portion for your dollar and where the food will have some actual taste.
