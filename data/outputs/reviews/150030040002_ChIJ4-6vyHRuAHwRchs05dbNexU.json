They are also one of the regular kiosks at the Fort St Mall Farmers Market every Tuesday/Friday and can get their picks for lower than their Alakea location. The rice they use is a special blend and is the best I've had... so far. The smoked salmon bowl they serve daily is also the best I've had on island. The miso soup they serve here is the only kind I can tolerate and I can go on about their variety of musubis (spicy shrimp and salmon are my favorite!). The staff is very respectful and attentive, the small location is clean and aesthetics very pleasing. You know you will be eating quality just from how much pride they take in preparations and presentation. It's a must try for downtown Honolulu eateries. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
