We both got the tasting menu, which included some standout dishes (pastas) and a free glass of Prosecco. We also bought a bottle of red wine. Unfortunately, it took two hours for our pasta to arrive. When the tenderloin steak came it was overcooked (probably by heat lamp). The halibut seemed bland, chewy, and under-seasoned. I\u2019ve had some incredible meals in the past, but this was the kind of bill where you expect to be wowed. The food just wasn\u2019t up to the standard.",

I\u2019m from Florence and usually I don\u2019t go to Italian places because they tend to be overpriced and quality ok. I was eager to go this time because my friend told me food was good and at a reasonable price. The ambience is nice but as we entered the host brought us to a table where there was no chair for me. She let us take a seat at another table and we ordered. We got Pancetta di Maiale and polenta (very unusual, you don\u2019t find it somewhere else), misticanza nice and fresh, bread to accompany dishes is delicious. Then, we got wine (the list is overpriced, btw!). So, our table was crowded and I asked if we could unite another table to ours so to have more space, since nobody were sitting next to us and the restaurant wasn\u2019t full. One of the server (not the one we were assigned) said the other table was reserved and couldn\u2019t accept our request. Which is fine, I understand. But then he started removing bread plates, other things and arranging the table to make more space as he wished. I didn\u2019t like that, and asked him to leave everything like it was and that we would have survived without an extra table, arranging the extra thing on the love seat where I was seated. Then, a guy who brought us our meal, saw the scene, spoke to the host and he was able to give us another table. We appreciate that. All this under the eyes of the young owner, who didn\u2019t even say hello or come to the table to greet us even though he noticed we were Italians. After the appetizers, we had pappardelle  with rabbit sauce (wonderful) and as a dessert Pumpkin pie. We expected something traditional but actually it was a delicious surprise, I recommend it. So food is really good here (authentic though, that I don\u2019t know) and I would rate it high, our waiter was very nice and attentive, but the others not very much. As an Italian restaurant I would expect the owner to be nicer and warmer, and the whole staff to be very attentive and friendlier.  Also, during the dinner, the young owner was seated at the bar and burped very loudly. I\u2019m sorry but this is unacceptable for me. Not very respectful of your guests.",

The menu is diverse, and the server, Anne Marie, was knowledgeable and solicitous.  My daughter enjoyed the leg of duck, I had the tasty Fettucini di Vitello, and my wife had the veal chop.  Although the first two dishes were well worth it, when the veal chop was served, supposedly cooked to medium, I thought the calf would sit up and moo at us.  My wife asked for it to be cooked more.  When the dish came out a second time, it was little more than gristle and fat; my wife couldn't even cut it with the sharp knife they gave her for that purpose.  Again they took the veal away, this time bringing her Fettucine di Vitello (her second choice), in such haste it makes one wonder what took the original orders so long to appear.   To the credit of the management, they did not charge us for either the veal or the second dish of  Fettucini.  The wait for our food was much too long.  It seems to me that even on Saturday, which is the busiest night for dining, a good restaurant should be at its best, not at its slowest.  We would return to San Lorenzo, but it would be during the week, and we definitely wouldn't order the veal chop.",

Not that in itself is a bad thing the problem is not meeting expectations.  The waiter or the menu should have been clearer.  That segues me to the other problem.  The wait staff were on top of us for the whole meal, it just made us feel rushed and uncomfortable the whole meal. Partly this was the table we were seated at but it could certainly have been handled better.",

Unfortunately, due to my late arrival I missed the appetizers but my friends said they were delicious. I ordered the braised ribs and I had cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake was delicious and tasted perfectly. It was freshly made and had just enough cream cheese taste. Furthermore, I ordered a glass of moscato and it was sooo good that I wanted a second glass. Finally, the atmosphere is small and intimate. The service was really good. The food came pretty quickly.",

First, the service was extraordinary and Joko (sp?), our Croatian server, was the epitome of good service in every way. He was hand-selected by Massimo to come work here upon its opening, so enough said.  The food was also delicious and the six of us had a smattering of nearly everything on the menu. My halibut was immaculate, all the pastas were perfect, and I would say that if we had any complaints at all, it would be about the veal Milanese, which was served dry and, although still quite good, would've benefited from at least a lemon or some kind of sauce (after Milanese is not synonymous with Austrian schnitzel, which this more resembled). I would say this was only a minor issue, though, as the veal itself was prepared very well. After all, it is also still a brand new restaurant and it will take some time for the kinks to be worked out.  Further praise includes the prices, which were very reasonable for a DC restaurant, and, since you are able to order half-portions of the pasta, you can have a very good meal for a good price or an even better, diverse meal for an average price!  In summary, this restaurant is an excellent choice for a classy Italian meal at a much more affordable level than some of the other, pretentious restaurants that inhabit the city - I would highly recommend a visit here.",

We usually like to arrive early at restaurants to enjoy some cocktails at the bar before we sit down for dinner. The hostesses were friendly, but also looked uncomfortable when they realized we arrived early. We said we were fine waiting at the bar until our actual rezzie.  It turned out they were running behind. Way behind. We did not get seated until 30 minutes past our reservation! Yup. 30 minutes. I should\u2019ve known from the facial expressions of the woman who I assume is management level. She looked very stressed. The thing about being in the hospitality business is the ability to keep your cool even when the situation is intense.  We went ahead and ordered a bottle of the 2014 Masi Brolo di Campofiorin along with the roasted calamari at the bar since we started feeling hunger pangs. When our table was finally ready, the hostess hovered behind us and kept reminding us that our table was ready. I finally turned around and asked her to give us a few minutes to finish our antipasto. Given how long they had us wait for our table, I didn\u2019t think it was too much to ask her to wait a couple of minutes. Sigh.  The food made up for it, tho. The dishes were amazing. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. We loved the roasted calamari, chitarra, and risotto. I had to return my mahi-mahi because it was heavily salted. They got it right the next time around. The fish was fresh and the kale and spinach that accompanied it was delicious.  Lastly, our sever was great. She was friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be back, but will give them time to smooth things out.",

True to Italian culinary form, ingredients and tradition drive the menu, rather than a trendy list of ingredients. I tried two fresh pastas that were perfect and left me hoping to return and sample through the rest of the menu. Plenty of approachable Italian wines and a contemporary cocktail program. I'll be back. Bravo, Chef Massimo!",
