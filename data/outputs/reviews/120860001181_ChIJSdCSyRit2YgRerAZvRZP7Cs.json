Once our waitress realized we were not ordering drinks we were totally ignored. We physically had to chase her down to get our check twice! Once to ask and once to get.

The server choose to be a server , I didn't choose the profession  for her. So she know as well a you the manager what come with the territory  as a server.  I have left at least 5% tip and nothing less. As I stated before that is unacceptable  behavior  in any profession  whether  you unhappy  with your job or not.  This is the USA and tips are not mandatory.  If you are not paying  your workers what they are worth that your issue and something  the  labor board needs to deal with. However  as you must know you my bill was paid along with a tip and does not warrant  me to or anyone to be banned, this doesn't even happen  in 5 star restaurants.  Please review customer  services  skills because you guys  definitely  lack. !!!!!  Also you never  even took the time to explain  anything  you went straight to arguing  with the customer.  CUSTOMERS  ARE ALWAYS  RIGHT! FIRST  THING THEY TEACH YOU IN YOUR PROFESSION  SINCE YOU PROCLAIM TO BE THE OWNER!",

When we walked up to the hostess stand, and stood directly in front of her.  She did not look up to greet us. She just continued to keep her head down and ignore that we were there.  I thought she must have been  doing something work related so we stood right in front and politely waited until she was finished and could seat us.  Well, this lasted for much longer than it should have  so I turned around to find a waitress pass by. I asked if she could seat us or at least give us a menu to look at until we could be seated.  That prompted the hostess to look up.  Upon closer glance I realized that the hostess was watching something on HER PHONE!  She looked annoyed that we had bothered her and rudely said \"You can sit wherever you want\" and look back down at her phone.  My husband and I walked onto the patio and my husband told me he didn't think he wanted to stay as he did not want to spend money in an an establishment that treated their patrons so rudely.  But I thought, lets give it another chance, so we sat down and waited, when a few minutes later the same hostess came out with an attitude to give us menus.  That prompted me to say, \"I'm not sure we're going to stay and eat. We are thinking about going elsewhere\" and she grabbed the menus back and said \"Go for it\".  I was in total shock that the hostess, whose main  job should be to greet patrons as they come in, make them feel welcomed, seat them, and display good customer service skills had none of this!  We refuse to spend our money at any restaurant that has terrible customer service no matter how good the food may be when you can go elsewhere have great food as well and be treated with respect.  And that's exactly what we did and ended up having a fantastic night out elsewhere!!",

We were having dinner and my father in law was wearing a sleeveless shirt, he said we can sit outside and Not inside. We were ok with it until it started pouring rain halfway through our dinner ($150 tab) we stk had more food on the way. We tried to come inside and he didn\u2019t let us. He said go next door and buy a shirt! What kind of human being will say that! He expected us to go next door in pouring rain instead of allowing us to stay to finish our dinner. I\u2019ve been living in Miami for 20 years and never experienced such terrible treatment. He refused to give his name but it\u2019s an older man with glasses.",

But as they say, there's always a first for everything.  First off, it was a friends 21st birthday and like most people we decided to stay local and grab a couple drinks. The place wasn't even close to being busy. Once we enter we were a party of 10 and sat us down at a booth where only 5 people could sit. I tell the person there if he could put the tables together and he did it very rudely while having this look on his face. I don't mind at first. Once we sat down the menus were just thrown at us and didn't make us feel welcomed what so ever. There's barely any lighting in the restaurant so I had to use the flashlight on my phone to look at the menu. Our server comes and he looks like a super chill dude. Greets us and says if he can start us off with anything to drink. We all ordered water and a couple of drinks. Once we finish ordering our drinks he then try to rush us to order the food. I told him give us at least 5 minutes to look at the menu. 20 minutes later he brings us our drinks. He then says if were ready to order and obvious we are. Once we all start ordering he didn't write down anything. He thought that he could memorize a 10 person order and not mess up. We all order and it takes at least 45 minutes for the food to come. Mind you this, the restaurant inside is completely empty. Just a couple of people at the bar. The music that was playing at this bar made me feel like I was at Ultra 2011. All they would play was heavy dub step and it made my brain melt. So the food comes and I cant contain my hunger after working a 6 hour shift earlier. I thought the food would be decent especially since I was high. But, let me not even start with the food. The chicken looked like I could go the the nearest 7/11 and make it. The chicken was so bland and extremely chewy. The lettuce looked like they went to the back pf the store and picked out leafs and the tomatoes were dry. On top of that, the fries were harder than a hockey puck and was cold. Once we all finished the waiter came and we all asked for separate checks. The waiter came with all of our checks and told us all to please tip him nice because they are under a lot of stress. Mind you this, its a Wednesday at 10 P.M. There was barely anybody there. The only thing they stressed out was me in the end. At the end, I don't recommend anybody to eat at this establishment. The waiters were rude, the owner didn't care, the food was mediocre at best, and the music selection was ran be a 10 year old. The first and last time i'll be there.",

There is a pool table in the back if you like to play a bit.  Restroom was not clean maybe because the place was packed.  Their staff was friendly and helpful the food was ok.",

We went around 4:30 and had some drinks before the kitchen opened at 5:00. The best thing about this place is the price!! Our bill for two appetizers and three drinks was around $30!!! That is the price of the drinks alone at any restaurant surrounding the Porterhouse. Prices in North Miami add up as most restaurants add 18% gratuity and the 9% tax. In addition, most restaurants have sandwiches in the $20-30 range and appetizers around $15, the Porterhouse was Much much more affordable - and the food was absolutely amazing.. much better than the restaurants we went to close by.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and refilled our water without even being asked several times. The only thing that is preventing me from giving 5 stars is the fact that you can smoke inside the restaurant. If you have kids or are someone who is sensitive to smoke then I wouldn't go.",
