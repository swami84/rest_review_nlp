I really wanted to give a second try because I know sometimes things can happen but is really up setting to not answer or leave you waiting for about 34 minutes on the line not assisting you or at least letting you know that they won\u2019t make it.

I had to put them back in the oven when i reached home, because i felt that uncomfortable eating them like that to risk getting sick. Then in terms of the pizza, they put very little sauce or toppings. So the result was a very dry pizza with no toppings. Considering i went out in the rain to go pick up the order i must say i was truly disappointed. If the food gets made like its being rushed or the store is on a severe budget its shows up in the overall result. The food pizza and wings were simply no good. I would of taken the order back to the store if not for the rain and wanting to get into any argument",

He cancels orders on weekends or any day it gets too busy for his taste because he gets overwhelmed OR on a good day he will just manually adjust the tracker to say that its out for delivery, wait another twenty minutes then clear it in a way that it look like you got your order so it looks good to corporate. Insult to injury half the time they wont even refund you your money so you are there with no food and cheated out of the cost of your order. THEN little indian man want to act like you are some angry colored person for going down there in person in to tell him about his stupid self since he is scared to answer the phone when you call....yes Im saying from experience! Then when you go to the store, the phone is ringing off the hook because every time he answers its someone on the line cursing him out because he does this same dumb ish to everyone. When asked why he dont answer his line he says \"People call me, curse me tell me 'F**k you'\" Uuumm yea dummy. You takin people cash, not delivering their food, curving their calls, and canceling their orders. Id say F you too sir. So now I have to deprive myself from Dominos when its the only one within a 20 minute distance because Pendejo cant run a franchise establishment...COME ON - A FRANCHISE!! THEY TRAIN YOU ON HOW TO DO BASIC STUFF WHEN YOU BUY THE DAMN STORE!! MORON! Dont waste your time. Order online and just walk in there to get it if you are seriously that desperate for pizza.

I spoke to someone at the store and was advised they would send a new order immediately. 2 hours later no one came, called again and was told they would send someone. Now approaching 11pm I call and spoke to someone else who took my contact and info and stated they would escalate this and will get a call back the next day. The next day is now today. I called in the evening, an employee answered and stated the manager was busy to call back,I called multiple times to be told the same thing. 3rd call,long holds,this employee told me to pack my kids up and come to the store( ridiculous). I was irate and he hung the phone up on me,I called again and no one responded,finally after calling multiple times this manager got on the phone and her apology was not genuine at all. I have been disrespected,lied to,inconvenienced. I've never experienced such bad service. This place is horrible they should shut down or find new employees",
