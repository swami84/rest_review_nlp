Half of these people giving one star rivews based on delivery speed would give 5 stars to a buffet with 10 hour old heat lamp food.  If you are they type of person who enjoys good food you won't complain when you see boxes in view of the public as if you need some fake dining experience to make a food review like so many pretentious reviewers.  What matters is the food you eat and this place makes your food to order in the wok as you wait, sometimes too long knowing that you will get a great meal which re-defines your belief in Chinese food after so many bad American knockoffs.  I reccomend the \"___ chow me fun\" with your choice of addons.  You will understand the quality when you taste these noodles.  With all of this said though I have not and would not eat the sushi here so this review is not including that side of the restaurant.",

Plenty of seating, but rather plain. Order at counter, sit where ever. Needs a few little things like plastic fork/spoons instead of metal fork/spoons, and napkins in napkin holders on table to move from a 4 to a 5. The option of some wait service would be 5+. Adding something to dampen the sound/noise of patrons from reverberating off the glass and the cooking with the other little things would make the place a 5++ homerun.  It is a shame the younger family members who are sitting playing video games, don't help wait and bus tables for tips instead of video games, as this could be not just a good fast food take out Chinese restaurant but an incredible eat in restaurant too!",

I got the atomic roll and I'll second what someone else said, they make it with cooked (well done) tuna over the top which is not clearly spelled out on the menu. It's and interesting decision to say the least. I found it basically unappealing and left it on the plate. It's obvious sushi is not their forte. The roll was misshaped and small and not very tightly rolled. Tended to kind of come apart. The spicy tuna inside was sashimi but was that tuna mush that some places do. Not very appealing.  I was in there at an odd time, about 8pm on a Thursday, but there was literally nobody in there. The place is pretty dirty and grimy. I realize you probably don't want to pull the curtain back on most Asian kitchens but this one is open to the store so you'd think they would keep it a little cleaner, not so much. Also smelled like hot used frying oil in there.  To recap: They're other menu items may be great but I wouldn't really recommend the sushi and I'd like to see them do some deep cleaning.",

I tipped the driver $5 which is a decent tip. He got mad because I didn't give him 15% plus $2. That's way to much of a tip for a $30 delivery order. I have been a server and delivery driver in my life and anything above a $3 tip in a mile radiusis plenty good. I gave him a fair tip but not 15% on top of a $2 delivery charge. He had me talk to manager and he said give food back. I said no, I paid for it and $6 tip is more than enough. So me and my 2 friendsdecided to eat on front porch. 1 minute after delivery driver left, he doubleback and threw a glass bottle at me hitting my work Truck shattering Glass everywhere. My dogs play there. I called cops and they said I don't even have to tip. We decided if he came back and cleaned Glass he could avoid any charge. Now he is looking at felony charges for launching a missle. Police man said his car was used to commit crime and will be impounded along with 2 felony charges. Lastly I had to argue to get refunded which after threatening to sue oriental express to get my $ back. The police men deserve big credit by way they handled situation. So I will be by 1st thing to talk with owner about the massive amount of glass on my property. I have 2 dogs that play there, plus my street has a lot of kids that play there. Food was just okay but they have no ethics nor morals. The same driver is still to work tomorrow. I'm all for people working but when a glass bottle gets chucked at my head that guy needs to be fired. Do not take chance with these guys. They have to many anger issues and you couldbenext. Do you want to tip $10 on a $35 order. Stay away. Samari blue is best place",

We love our experience with Oriental express every time. Staff is always so friendly and happy. We always get delivery, and it is always on good timing and our orders are always larger- yet always correct. The sushi is really tasty and FRESH. I love the T&T roll I get it every time. Also a fan of the scallop roll and the rainbow roll. The Chinese food is also so delicious. They're veggie fried rice is my favorite. Highly reccommed for delivery, take out or dine in. Sushi or Chinese...whatever you are craving...You will enjoy this place.",

There were two people in the entire  restaurant eating from their buffet menu which looked alright. It took them 35 minutes to make three rolls while we waited. The volcano roll actually tasted as if lava had solidified around some rotten fish. I definitely needed something cleanse my palate after eating this. Next up the \"Mexican' roll tasted a little sweet, so unless they were referring to a churro, I am not so sure how 'Mexican' it actually was. Last but definitely not the least of their offerings, the Atomic roll came out and looked like it was topped off with some Bumblebee solid white tuna and some avocados that sat out a little too long. I flicked off most of the topping simply to avoid food poisoning and just ate the roll. These were ok at best but definitely better than the other two offerings. There are several sushi places to choose from downtown that are far and away better than Oriental Express. One can only surmise that the name for this establishment has a direct correlation to the amount of time that is takes for their food to pass through your body and not their service.",

Orient Express it was\u2026 Had Agatha Christie ever visited here, she might have not written her novel at all. Had she used me as one of the characters\u2026 I would have wanted to be murdered first. My nose is rather high maintenance. The food looked interesting (my mother uses this adjective when she does not want to criticize my accessory choices, the ones she really disagrees on.) Let me make clear that I don\u2019t mind cafeteria style places. But I felt odor-slapped as soon as I walked in. I also feel very pressured when asked for my order immediately. Perhaps others feel catered to\u2026 or welcomed when that happens. Not me. So I was a tad nauseous over the smell (mind you, it was not a foul smell at all. It was the overwhelming combination of food choices mingling and marrying, overpowering and divorcing all at once.) Had I fallen in love with the bareness of the decorations\u2026 wait! What decorations? No, that did not help to distract me either. Have I mentioned how visually sensitive I can be? I love beautiful things. The Libra in me seeks beauty. Anywhere. Everywhere. I will refrain from reviewing the place in detail even when, until today (yes, no more), I called for deliveries and found the food okay. They serve abundantly. Huge plates to share\u2026 if you wanted to share okay food with family or guests. I have delivery-tried (which was like blind tasting until today): fried rice, white rice, egg rolls (quite oily tasting), bourbon chicken, orange chicken, egg drop soup, steamed dumplings, pepper steak and Lo Mein. Call and order with enough time so that your hangriness does not get the best of you. I went today. I felt catfished like in the MTV show. Our relationship platonic and beautiful. Maybe not the best, but okay. Nice\u2026 and nice is often good. Why did I try to ever meet?",

Placing the order was as painful as can be but yet my growling stomach talked me into finishing the ordering process. After well over an hour passes I call and tell them I ordered 1:15 minutes ago. They ask for my address which is 5minutes away tops, and proceed to tell me it will be 15minutes. I then asked them why it was going to take so long has my food left yet? And they said no not yet. However they were going to send the same old food to me. I suggest otherwise.",
