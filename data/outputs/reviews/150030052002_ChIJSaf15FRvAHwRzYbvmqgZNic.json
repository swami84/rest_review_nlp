The campechana is a refreshing seafood dish with fleshy cubes of raw ahi, tender slices of tako, and boiled pieces of shrimp marinading in a tangy tomato-lime sauce with cucumbers and avocados. Delicious on its own, it\u2019s even better with a healthy spoonful of their dark, smoky, vinegar-chili sauce and spooned onto a crunchy fried tortilla chip.  The taquitos? Deep fried crunchy goodness stuffed with shredded meat stewed in spices. It\u2019s served covered in a bed of shredded lettuce and tomatoes, then sprinkled with cheese. It\u2019s good on its own, maybe a 7/10, BUT THEN. Add some hot sauce. Oh god, the hot sauce. They have two types of homemade hot sauce and they are both marvelous. The green sauce is a powerful punch of garlic with a mild dash of spice. Green sauce was my husband\u2019s favorite, even when he was too full to keep eating.  And the red sauce? Ahhhh. Mouth watering heat. Spice lovers will enjoy the kick, but it\u2019s not so hot that you\u2019ll be dying. Ask for some extra water and you\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll be better than fine. You\u2019ll be wiggling in your chair in ecstasy, because the combination of red sauce and green sauce and crispy fried Mexican food will be a riot of flavor in your mouth.  The taquitos are an easy 9-9.5/10 with the hot sauces.  Then there\u2019s the chilles rellenos. My favorite, by far. The best version of chilles rellenos I\u2019ve ever had on the island. It\u2019s a large poblano pepper grilled til its tender and perfect, not slimy, not mushy. Just firm enough to help you scoop the flavorful bed of ground beef, spices, and cheese layered and melted on top of it. Soooo good, and so flavorful all by itself. But then you add the red and green sauce to it? Ugh. I could eat this forever. 10/10.  My husband enjoyed the pork shoulder, but with the first three dishes I didn\u2019t have room for another bite. Last time I had it, I remember the meat was really good and the pickled onions had a mild sweetness it comes with warm tortillas, stewed beans, and its own delicious hot sauce.  Overall, this was a great restaurant, incredibly delicious, and worth the drive from Kapolei. Can\u2019t wait to go there again, hopefully sometime soon.",

There are so many things I love about this restaurant - the indoor space is absolutely charming, and the outdoor eating space is epic!  It is beautifully decorated, quiet, inviting.  Best outdoor eating space I've been do on Oahu. This is not your typical Mexican fare.  If you like high quality, truly authentic, masterfully flavorful dishes - eat at Tlaxcalli.  Our party of four chose five different dishes and they were each superb. I ordered the chili relleno.  I am always on the hunt for an excellent chili relleno and almost always disappointed.  This one well exceeded my expectations.  Large, perfectly stuffed pablano chili in a bowl with the most incredible sauce!  loved the white beans in a savory broth. You can choose seafood, beef, mushroom or chicken. The salsa's were so flavorful - I'm still craving them days later. Excellent service by sweet owner.  Please support this locally owned, family business. I hope they make it through the pandemic. We need to support local small businesses!",

Tasty non-creamy Caesar salad, with a light dressing & a massive hunk of ahi! My mom got the chili realano which wasn't fried, so much lighter than expected, but stuffed with mushrooms & cheese. Yum!",
