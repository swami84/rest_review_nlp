Most recently a very rude (not the first time, she is usually rude to \"certain\" people, as I've noticed several times when both dining in and picking up an order) staff member, disgustingly addressed me when I was picking up an order. I told her the name of the order, and the contents, and she refused to give me the order until seeing it on the app. Even after showing her on the app, she still refused until another staff member told her that the order was in fact mine. She made an annoyed face, hastily handed me the order, muttered something in another language, then walked away.  This happened just last night. I notice she doesn't interact with other customers this way. This is NYC, there's going to be all types of people that order from or dine in the restaurant. All customers should be treated with respect, not just those you choose to, because of how they look.  I will no longer be ordering or dining at this restaurant.",

My husband and I randomly stopped in because we saw they had backyard seating and we didn\u2019t need a reservation. It\u2019s a cozy little backyard with seating for small and large groups. Beyond the ambiance and excellent service, the food was amazing. Everything was fresh and tasty, and cooked to perfection. My husband had the grilled pork with papaya salad. It came with jasmine sticky rice in a cute little basket. I had the 1/2 boneless duck with spicy (mildly) basil fried rice. We also had the chicken satay and tamarind duck roll as appetizers. He also had the Caribbean Lover cocktail and it was great. I\u2019ve been to other Thai restaurants that served similar food and the prices were higher. I felt this was really reasonable. I would definitely recommend and return sometime!",

It truly is my go to place for family members b-day, Friday night girls out, quick bite with the hubby and even when I just want some me time, I go alone.  Today we had take out because of social distancing.  My husband and I decided to drive all the way there and pick up because we just missed the place.  Our total came to $46.87 for shrimp basil fried rice, papaya salad and a duck entree with broad noodles.  My husb gave them $50 cash and told them keep the change of $3.13.  Upon almost exiting my husband remembered I had asked for an extra sauce on the side.  He turned around and asked them for the sauce. He was told $1. He went in his pocket and gave them a dollar. He was then told 9\u00a2 more.  He checked his pockets and did not have 9\u00a2.  He told them unfortunately he did not have 9\u00a2.  They told him he can use his card to purchase the $1.09 sauce.  He advised he did not have his card on him.  He was told they could not give him the sauce.  FOR 9\u00a2, you tell a customer that just spent almost $50 and gave you the balance, that you cannot give him a sauce BECAUSE OF 9\u00a2??? My husband was taken aback.  He said \"I just spent almost $50 on food and gave you a $3.13 tip for nothing at all and you will deny me sauce for 9\u00a2? Ok then, take the 9\u00a2 out of the tip then\".  The person had the nerve to be shocked he was requesting such...and gave him the sauce for $1.  I find it appalling that Born would treat their customers this way over 9\u00a2, when honestly we didn't have to tip them anything, as we were picking up our food. I still can't believe this happened.  OVER NINE CENTS!! \ud83d\ude27 When people are not dining out as much and being very prudent on how and where they're spending their money, Born you really should do a better job at appreciating your loyal customers that are still supporting you during these hard times.",

I got a big no from the manager, he said its closed. That way he said it was the worst experience I ever had on a restaurant, He lost us as a costumer and will never recommend this restaurant to any body!

The tables are very close, and neighboring conversations can, at times, be very disturbing.  The quality of the food ensures that it is my go-to spot for Thai.",

Anyway, as I'm getting ready to place an order, my friend tells me that he ordered food yesterday and didn't have tip to give and that they told him they're not going to deliver to the address anymore for not giving a tip. I called anyway, I didn't think they were that serious but they actually appeared to be serious. The man said he would deliver if i put a tip on card, and if I wanted to tip in cash, I would have to go to the restaurant and pick it up myself.  1. Why would a person give tip before seeing/tasting their food or even seeing how the person present themselves? 2. more importantly, out the hundred times we've ordered and tipped, you get rude for the ONE time we didn't?  A tip is given when you go above and beyond for a person, build a connection or if the weather is horrible. If you don't do that then you're an ordinary person. I'm simply just going to pay for the food. These people literally FORCED us to tip them.",

I ordered a knockout (drink). It was good, not as strong as I expected it to be. However the appetizers and entre made up for it. We had the rock shrimp. It tasted so good. They present it to you in a martini glass. The shrimp is sitting in a bed of lettuce and a sweet dressing at the bottom. We also had the steamed veg and thai dumplings. Both were very good. The crispy rolls are very good too. It's a thin crispy roll with shrimp, accompanied by a dipping sauce. My friend ordered the duck with Jasmine rice. The duck was delicious! What made it even better was the sauce it came with. Everything that we tried that night was good. Even our bartender Somboon. He made our evening pleasant and fun. If you're ever in the Flatbush/downtown area and looking for a place to enjoy good food and drinks with friends/family, Born Thai Is the place to go!!!",

The Talking Heads and Beatles played at a nice quiet but audible volume over head.   We started with the Tom Kai vegetable soup.  At first bite this did not blow me away but had the power to keep pulling my spoon back and I was struck with a keen sense of disappointment when it was gone.   The Pad Se Ew was good and flavorful - but standard.  The Masaman on the other had was refreshingly excellent.  It had fresh avocado and chick peas.  Intense mouth filling taste that did not overwhelm but warm - like a nice hug from your fat grandma.  Service was fast and friendly.  My water glass was never more than half empty - which is important to me when eating a spicy meal.  This is my new neighborhood Thai location.",
