As I was eating my lunch, I noticed that the chicken was mostly uncooked and as I was getting worried about this, I found a blue rubber band piece in the meal (the chicken). I went back to the counter and requested to speak to the manager. When she came, I requested a refund. They did refund me, however this is an irresponsible restaurant which does not meet health standards and it seems to be failing to offer healthy food to our students, staff and faculty members at UIC.",
