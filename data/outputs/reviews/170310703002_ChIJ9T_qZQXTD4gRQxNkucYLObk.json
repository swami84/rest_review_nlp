The food was quite disappointing for both myself and my counterpart, as the portions were very small (we got a bacci pizza slice after, as we weren't full at all) and not what you expected. My noodle dish had barely any noodles in it and was loaded with way too many mushrooms, and my partner's curry was just chicken with a sauce drizzle on it.. not what you'd expect from a curry. On top of it all, the server was kind of rude and didn't seem like she wanted to be there at all.",

Parking on street wasn't difficult to come by and costs $2/hour.  In terms of service, no issue getting a seat on an early Friday night dinner. Place did fill up quite quickly after we were seated so it does seem to be a somewhat popular spot. Overall the service I'd say was attentive, no issues getting some one to take our order, get refills on water, grab out bill, etc.  For food, like I said just okay. The tom kha with chicken was decent. The ingredients could've been chopped up a bit more but overall flavors were there. Pad see eiw was okay but I felt like it shined because I was pretty disappointed with my basil leaf chicken. Thai rolls to start were a highlight of the meal as they were delicious but a bit costly for what it is.  Hard to say I'd be back for this one with Paula's kitchen just a few doors down.

In all honesty I\u2019m really not sure how they have such good ratings. It was some of the worst pad Thai I\u2019ve had in the city for a pretty high price. It looked nothing like the picture and only consisted of the noodles with sauce and tofu. No veggies, peanuts, or garnish?! It was oily and tasteless. I usually love having leftovers, but this one tasted 10x worse the second day. Boba tea and grab Rangoon were fine, nothing special, definitely over priced.  I will never order from or dine here again, and will certainly not recommend to anyone looking for good bites in LP",

My friends and I went on a Saturday night for our friend's birthday when the restaurant was practically empty.  Because we only ordered appetizers the waiter was ripping the napkins and our water cups practically out of our hands and asked when we were going to leave.  I have never experienced a more rude waiter.  We were shocked by how outrageous he was being and when I asked what we had done wrong he was furious we only bought appetizers.  I'm sorry but when your restaurant is EMPTY, you should be happy with any business you receive.  We were a pretty quiet bunch but we couldn't believe ourselves when he was aggressively clearing the table while we were still enjoying our dining.  He even gave a middle finger to me when we asked for the check!! Appalling, absurd, infuriating, terrible.  I wish I could tell the world how terrible this place is.  I called out the waiter, informed him of everything I am typing, and he still was rude.  All other wait staff apologized profusely.  Never EVER spend money here, I hope Karma comes back to bite the inappropriate and rude behavior we experienced!",

We absolutely loved this place however, during our last visit we received terrible and I mean AWFUL service.  Our waitress was very rude and had a very bad attitude. When we finally got to order (btw, I had to turn around to the table behind us where she sat eating and talking to her friend to let her know that we were ready to order) she had the most disgusting look on her face as if we were bothering her or getting on her nerves. She was anything but welcoming. She never asked us if we wanted anything to drink never checked on us to see if we were in need of napkins or straws etc.  The customer service was disgusting and the only reason I gave one star is because I had to. If I could I would give 0 stars. Before leaving I told the waitress that we did not enjoy our stay because the service she gave was terrible and not to my surprise she ignored us and looked away. There was a guy sitting with her who seemed to be in charge, and all he said was, \"ohhh, well ok.\" SERIOUSLY???!!!  Never coming back!!! It's truly unfortunate! There are way better Thai restaurants to go to that will appreciate the money I CHOOSE to spend at their establishment.",

It came out just right. I also really like spicy food.. When I ask them to make it spicy, they actually do. Also, the Spring Rolls are fantastic.",

Forget the wonton soup, the pad thai, lo mein, fried rice or garlic chicken. It's all either tasteless or oversesoned. I've given them several tries but I'm done.
