Some of the dishes were overcooked, while other dishes were not Thai at all!  Strike two! Upon asking for the check, we were advised that the credit card terminal was not working, so management wanted us to write down our credit card information so they can charge us later!!!! We truly believe that the owners of Am Thai were out of their minds to even ask for that!!!! Strike three! Am Thai is out! In conclusion, we would never suggest Am Thai to anyone!!!",

The delivery is super quick and the guy is so sweet, the food is DELICIOUS, the portions are large and there's always enough for leftovers!  I get the same thing ever time; a jumbo Thai Iced Tea (it comes in a quartz plastic container and is definitely worth $6), beef pad see ew (delicious, saucy and full of beef!!), and the spring rolls (i always save the spicy dipping sauce to eat with something else later because it's honestly that good)  10/10 experience, I'll definitely keep ordering from here",

Myself on the other hand was well pleased! Apart from being just a tad bit too salty, my food was quite tasty.. I ordered their Eggplant with tofu in Chilli basil sauce.. I got mild Spicey as I wanted to enjoy my food.. This dish is usually very Spicey.  Overall, the service was good, food is great and the bathroom is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

The writers try to get you out of there ASAP!  Overall I found the quality of service far below what you find in NYC restaurants which is often high. Not here,  our waiter had an anattitude, and did not care, rushed us with the orders, did not help with selection and made no suggestion, and as soon as I put my fork down slap the bill in front of us. The food was ok, nothing special to brag about, just average thai. I think because they are one of the few thai restaurants in the vicinity,  maybe they have gotten a bit carried away and careless,  they figure the dont have to be nice to get customers,  makes sense.",

That's from the Tunnel to Sheepshead Bay / Marine Park... we go out of our way to eat here every other week. Nearly everything on the menu is great. My kids love Pad See Ew and dumplings. Wife likes Samoza triangles, curry puffs, and duck roll and I go for the red curry as hot as they will make it, although nowhere near as hot as I like (see Thai Thai in volcano village, HI) it's still excellent. Occasionally I add on steamed rice noodles instead of eating it with the usual white rice. Other things we've had that are really good are crab fried rice, labb salad, and  rice ginger soup (for colds). If you looking for one thing we avoid Hot Chic Phuket is about the only thing we've really not liked... Twice. Everything else has been either very good or great.",

The restaurant inside is so nicely decorated, a little small but its cozy and clean. My favorite that I love is the fried calamari, pad thai, the drunken noodles are very tasty, the korean chicken wings and mock duck dishes, and my thai iced tea are all my top dishes. Also the prices aren't that bad for two people that order an appetizer, two drinks and two entrees comes to around $32. They also do take out as well, they stay pretty busy in there but they keep things moving nicely.",

We ordered pretty run of the mill stuff: Tom Yum Soup, Drunken Noodle, Green Curry, and a Papaya Salad. All max spicy level, which came as advertised.  The food was tasty, clean, and affordable. It took less than 30 minutes to prepare.  Have not tried many other local Thai establishments, but don't see a need to.  If you are a Thai enthusiast, I can't have a next level conversation with you about authenticity or quality, but at that rate, we should probably spend our time doing something more meaningful with our lives.",

Simply stated, if I'm ordering Thai food, I'm ordering it because I want food with flavor.  Sorry to say, considering how I always want to support local businesses, that this was unfortunately the blandest and most flavorless Thai food I've ever had, and I've ordered from Spice in Manhattan. Som Tum was lacking that signature blend of fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and spice. Just a lot of chiles and cardboard tasting green papaya. Pad thai was nothing but noodles and chicken, overly sweet, dry and...well..pretty much flavorless. No fried tofu, 4 little bits of green onion, and...that's it. Tom yum soup was in comparison good, but still watery.  If a Thai restaurant can't nail these simple staples (also tasted the wife's order of Tom kha and drunken noodles, same conclusion:  flavorless except for overly sugary, which, drunken noodles? Sweet?) then just order from somewhere else. Outside of Sunnyside/Elmhurst Queens, NYC seems to have a serious dearth of quality Thai places, and unfortunately this seems to fall into the category of \"just not making it\".",

Not sure if short staffed or simply being serviced by those that see people of color as invisible. My patience was tried tonight. With my hand in the air to get my servers attention, my non-colored neighbors request was heard yet I passed as I sit in the tiny aisle hand raised! I am a woman with a sizable presence in any room at 6 feet. How inept can you be? I had to call out loudly for the server as she passed me again.  Even when it was time to pay the bill!!! Although my card was submitted (food bagged and ready) my neighbors echo for theirs was met with a signature receipt before mine.  After waiting patiently, I went to the counter and asked for my payment receipt only to find my card hadn\u2019t even been rung! The matron fumbled and then provided my receipt for signature. Shamefully, I admit to awarding a tip. They really deserved no more than $4- only for the cooks and servers literally bringing the items to the table. I felt responsible to tip decently in atttempts to breakdown the stereotypes and perhaps garner some respect for those coming after us (yes way too deep analysis of a tip, but sometimes there is no better tip than leaving no tip)!  General Opinion I have lived in a home in this neighborhood for forty years and eaten here on numerous occasions since their opening. I would never advise anyone to travel more than 5 blocks for this place. Even on their better days they are not all of that. The food is a good go to neighborhood grab if you live in the neighborhood and/or a parking spot is right in front. They have cute cocktails in lovely displays, however the space is tiny- just removing one table would make all the difference.  You can dip your fork in your neighbors dish for a sample or simply hold hands! Ridiculous!  When serving our neighbor their food, my servers underarm literally touched me and hip another time. Also space can be overwhelmingly loud depending upon who else shares the space (groups or heavy drinkers). Obviously over it!",

Now no matter how hard I try I always end up ordering either pad Thai or drunken noodles. I just can't help but regret when I see someone slurping those delicious rice noodles. The pad Thai here was perfect and just the right amount of wetness (pad Thai lovers know what I mean). Now the drunken noodles are another level, if you like to spice things up then this is the dish for you. There's no alcohol in it despite the name.  But a tip for people bringing home leftovers, thai food doesn't smell so great after a spin in the microwave, probably due to the fish sauce.",
