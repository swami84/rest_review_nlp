Servers are attentive and they actually make pretty darn good drinks! I love Asian food but also love atmosphere. This is a great place to come and chill out. They also have a very efficient delivery service if you'd rather be in the comfort of your own home. Lastly, you can expect to take home leftovers as the portions are really big.",

I thought this may be a training ground for people to get ready for the \"Patron Challenge\" Well, one thing is for sure, El Patron in my book stands for Inexpensive and tasty Mexican food. The Lunch specials are a great deal!  Here's a tip - Yelp check in = free slice of flan! already off to a great start! I was here for lunch and the deals are excellent in my book. Delicious copious amounts of food with great service thrown in!  We started out by ordering \"Flautas\" a fried tortilla almost resembles a crispy egg roll filled with chicken and topped with pico de gallo, lettuce and sour cream. The chicken meat was a little under seasoned for my taste, but it was still a great appetizer to start the meal.  For our Entr\u00e9e we ordered the Mini Bandeja paisa and Combo Patron. We were served a side salad before our meals arrived. We were amazed how large the lunch orders were. The Bandeja looked like a thing of beauty when they placed it on our table, perfectly cooked medium skirt steak, egg sunny side up, moist avocado, sweet moist plantains and pork belly fried up nice, crispy and crunchy. The white rice was moist and not overly salty. The beans were soft, flavorful and OMG delicious!  The Combo Patron was a huge plate of Awesomeness! The combo comes with a Steak taco, pork tostada and Chicken enchilada. They serve It with yellow rice and beans, The combo looked like a big mess, messy to eat but our taste buds savored every delicious bite!  We were so full from our meals and had leftovers to take home, but for some strange reason we always find room for dessert, a free one in this case, thanks Yelp! :) The Flan was OK and we ordered coffee. I appreciated that they heated up the milk, but the coffee was a little on the weak side for us.  All this for about $25, not a bad deal for lunch, couple that with great company and exceptional service, now that's what I call a winning combination!",

The reason I say that is NOT BECAUSE of the extra oil, salt or msg people use to make their food delicious. Rather, they use \"Just the right \" amount of oil, Salt, Sugar and it just taste very healthy as you take each bite. This is my second order from there. I ordered sweet and sour from lunch special and I would definitely give it a 9/10 stars.  Try it out. You won't be disappointed. God Bless.",
