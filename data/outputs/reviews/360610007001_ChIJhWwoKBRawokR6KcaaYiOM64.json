But as soon as you enter there is a cold vibe from the staff. The service is hardly what one might cal \u201cfriendly.\u201d  The prices aren\u2019t bad at first glance, but when the food comes you can\u2019t help but to feel cheated. Portion sizes are small, and the presentation is bland. I ordered scrambled eggs as well as an egg white omelet. That\u2019s literally all that I got. At least they\u2019re honest.  No seasoning. Bland. The egg whites were overcooked. It was hardly an omelette at all. Toast on the side. Perhaps it was buttered but I couldn\u2019t tell... it was so dry.  And the side salad was literally just a handful of greens. No additions, spices, flavor, or garnish whatsoever.  I wish it had turned out better. But I probably won\u2019t return. There are plenty of cafes in the city. This one has a great atmosphere. But if you\u2019re looking for anything near flavorful food or decent service, your best head somewhere else. Once again I\u2019m left regretting that I didn\u2019t go to McDonald\u2019s. At least they\u2019re tasty and consistent.",

Financier just makes cakes with really balanced flavor profiles, that you take one bite of and can just keep on eating. A little pricey but worth every bit of the price for special occasions.

I purchased a chocolate chip cookie, the tiny chocolate mousse cake, and the tiny modern yule log. The chocolate chip cookie is hard on the edges but soft towards the center. It can be a tad sweet, but I can see how people would like to order coffee or tea with it. The mousse cake is the perfect flavor of chocolate. It's not too sweet or too bitter and it's a strong chocolate flavor. The modern yule log is made from pistachios, chocolate, and I think cherry? It's cute because it has two tiny mushroom-shaped meringues on it which makes it look more \"log-like\". There were macaroon shells on the end of the logs and they were surprisingly really good. I would definitely go back for more cakes or macaroons.",

Secondly the pastries are absolutely to die for and I would gladly pay $4.50 over and over again for another chocolate mousse cake because it was absolutely delicious!  I think I paid around $8 total for the pastry and a small hot chocolate but the hot chocolate was definitely made from scratch and not a powder or mix so it was well worth it.  If you're from out of town and looking for a quick coffee and snack maybe pass this place by.  But if you've got a little money to spend then I highly recommend this place.  My only sadness comes from the fact that I live in Wisconsin and can't get the chocolate mousse cake again for a long long time.  :(",

Some of the baked goods are great, but I would steer clear of the bear claw.  After eating the macaroons, you'll agree with Homer Simpson:  Mmmmmmmmmm, Macaroons.   I think I'll head there now.",

I went with their scone, although I will admit um everything looked good and I would have much preferred to eat my way through the display. Restraint though... restraint. Along with the fact that would have cost a pretty penny!  So verdict is it's worth going out of the way. I loved the Euro cafe feel to it and it served to, darn it, secure the fact that I'm likely to make that trip many many more times down that cobblestone road.",
