The pork was a little tough but Greek isn't a huge pork cuisine in my experience. The greek salad is the greek salad you would get from any greek restaurant, and the pita was standard. There was a weird oniony creamy spread type addition that tasted good, but I was not familiar with. It was not baba ghanoush or hummus, but may have been a greek spread I haven't met yet. Either way, I was not upset it graced my plate. This would have been a 3 star review if I hadn't tried a cocktail. The Dios Mojito. It was a nice fruity riff on the standard mojito, and because I am nothing if not thorough in my objective reviewing, I got a second to make sure the first was not a fluke. Neither were flukes. Or both were. Either way, they were delicious. 4 stars for my best food experience in Tampa so far.",

The menu includes many salads and appetizers to choose from. They also have entrees, wraps and bowls. I decided to try one of their bowls and ordered the Mediterranean bowl. It came with tabuli, babghaanoush, falafel, fresh greens and sliced beets. You can add a protein for an additional charge. I decided to add gyro meat. All the ingredients were fresh and it was a tasty meal. The Falafel stole the show. The pieces were huge, and more importantly tasted delicious. Served with tahini sauce of course. If the rest of the meal had been subpar, I still would have rated the meal three stars because of the awesome Falafel. They also have beer, wine, and evening entertainment. Very good experience and will definitely return.",

The service was excellent and the food was just as good. The restaraunt is nice, clean, and fresh. Waitress said on Friday nights the place is packed with a D.J. and dancing. I forgot to mention a fill bar.  I had SPANAKOPITA PLATTER that included a Greek Salad. Spanakopita is a phyllo dough (similar to puff pastry) filled with spinach and feta cheese with some great spices and served with a light yogurt dip. I added 2 Fallafes for protein. The Greek Salad was fresh and perfectly seasoned with a light dressing. I was more than satisfied! I could not even taste my wife's BakIava!!! Keep in mind, I am not a vegetarian and my favorite is a nice Steak.  Next time I want to try their Gyro!",

However, if it were certain \u201csomebodies\u201d with a group of women ordering their drinks from the bar, this was fine. I watched as they poured one guys shots while enforcing the \u201cmask rule\u201d on others just to deny them service once they complied (I\u2019ll go ahead and let you guess the color of the people that were allowed to order from the bar vs who wasn\u2019t).

My mother took home about half of hers...she got the giro platter.... we topped it all off with an  extremely large piece of Lebanese chocolate cake... Which was to die for.... It was a wonderful experience... The place was very clean... The waitress was very sweet and friendly....

We arrived at 515 and others were dining outside, so I assumed they were open , but 5 males were moving tables around (4 staff and a manager).  None were wearing masks.  Two men came within 3 feet of my table numerous times without a mask in sight, to grab and move tables/chairs.  Then a third male came outside and was packaging silverware, with his mask resting under his chin.  The host was carrying his mask in his hand while he seated a new customer.  A fourth male was wiping down a table three feet away from my table, again maskless.  His nose was running, he kept sniffing, and I saw him wipe his nose twice, but never add a mask.  Then the same guy came back with a leaf blower and was blowing stuff out from under the tables, 3 feet away, while we\u2019re ordering and drinking cocktails.  I am not happy; I have asthma and my dinner guest has allergies.  That is VERY UNCLEAN in any setting but especially in an eating establishment during a pandemic.  I will NEVER return; I am floored the restaurant staff would be this uncaring.  If you think this is alarming, imagine all of the health and hygiene violations that are probably happening OUT OF SIGHT of the diners!",

Everyone's food came out at different times, and some people got finished eating before others even got their food. Our server wasn't attentive at all and we had to constanly ask for drink refills. On top of that,  I was charged for additional pita bread when I didn't order any. We got there at 7:30 and we didn't leave until 10pm.",

As an appetizer we had the ceviche (not pictured). This was pretty good but would have been better if they didn\u2019t use such thick (overly fried) pita triangles (and maybe double the quantity of chips).  It would also be better if they cut up the shrimp instead of putting in whole (tail on shrimp) given the small size of the pita triangles and large size of shrimp.",

It was a friend of mine's birthday a couple days ago and due to it being at the beginning of the week, we decided to celebrate last night. We made our first stop, had our fun, and once done we proceeded to Dio. Said friend made reservations earlier in the week, Tuesday I believe, for our group of ten. We arrived, were promptly seated, and everything was fine. Then somebody who worked there came up and told us we had to move outside because somebody else had reservations and they specifically asked to be seated inside versus outside. We were all pretty miffed at this point because we were seated, already ordered drinks, were preparing to order appetizers, etc. The other party of ten that asked to be seated inside, allegedly, was nowhere to be seen. So, all ten of us head outside and see them setting up our \"table\". I use the word table in quotations because I can't think of a better word. It was a row of two-person tables in the middle of the sidewalk, segregated from the rest of the customers, and blocking the walkway for pedestrians. I wish I had taken pictures. There was a car parked on the curb and if the owners had returned to the vehicle, two or three of us at that table would have had to get out of our seats and move to allow them in. We basically said, \"Screw this. We're out.\" This seating arrangement was unacceptable and by the time we left, the other group that allegedly had reservations and allegedly asked to be seated inside whereas we didn't when we made our reservations, still hadn't shown up. Several of us asked to speak to the manager. The person we were speaking to refused. From what I gather, they knew that they were in the wrong or they would get fired for pulling that stunt. Why turn down a ten-top THAT HAS RESERVATIONS? Not that it matters, but I'll never return to Dio. I'd rather just walk a block and down and grab a couple slices from Eddie and Sam's, which is what we ended up doing anyway.",

My wife and I sat down, and from the time the server took our order it took 25 minutes to get our drinks. Took 45 minutes to get our food. Took 20 minutes to get a check from the time we finished. Literally never saw the server the last half hour, we had to call the hostess over to get the check and pay. The server had offered to comp an app earlier, which we accepted, and when the bill came the item was still there. Meanwhile the owner is schmoozing with the regulars instead of trying to ensure his patrons arent miserable. Want to know a bad way to make regulars? Awful service, literally the worst. A shame. The food is decent, and we live 10 minutes walking distance away. Would have loved to find a new spot to frequent. But this is a hard pass.",

It was a pretty busy night, but we still had to wait extended amounts of time for our waitress to come to our table. Other tables were clearly given more priority over ours and it was a little frustrating to see.

Please note that I'm a really picky person when it comes to food and you should take my experience as personal observations and nothing more, I'm and artist not a cook or food expert lol.  Here's a few Pros + and Cons -  +Fancy looking place +Food was incredibly tasty and abundant  -+ inside and outside don't have much difference  in heat or cold as there's a huge window/door opened that connects inside to outside -+ Pricey, but expected due the area is located in -+ like every downtown parking is a headache but not the restaurant's fault  -It can use some variety -no pita bread before the meal (most Mediterranean places we have gone to give us a taste of it so we truly missed it -Waitress needed to be reminded of drinks ordered -strong drinks felt very watered down (my brothers comment)  In brief, fancy place perfect for a nice date with a few selection of big plates with delicious taste. Give it a try and make your own opinion. Till next time!",

This is after we had to ask multiple waitresses repeatedly and we saw at least 2 other tables receive full meals. Some of those tables sat down AFTER we did.  We watched a table who arrived after us receive 3 hookahs before we did. Seems like the owner plays favorites with those he knows and just ignores the others. He never came to apologize to us for the wait. They were not full. Only one table inside was occupied. I watched a hookah be brought to another table in under 10 minutes when the person arrived and talked to someone else about knowing the owner.  The hookah itself was quite harsh and didn't hit as nice as other places. Definitely not worth a 45 minute wait.  I used to like this place when it had a different name but this experience has really given me a different view. I think I will visit Acropolis instead. Have had much better experiences there.",

After about five minutes someone came over to greet us after walking past us a few times initially.  Didn't have a listing of wine and when asked server had to go check what they had since she said it changes quite a bit.  No big deal but was a foreshadow for everything else and at $12 a glass there should be some consistency.  Ordered hummus appetizer with chicken kabob and lamb chop for entree's.  Hummus was good, but only came with minimal pita chips.  We asked for more and got them about ten minutes later but were charged extra, even though what we got initially was insufficient.  Then took 28 minutes from the time we got our appetizer for our entrees to come out, only to be served chicken kabob that was basically cold, even though there was hardly anyone else eating at the time.  Ketchup that came with fries was in a plastic to go cup with lid still on, meaning someone had probably dished it out that morning or the day before.  Tacky for the prices they charge.  Menu said kabob came with a salad, which it didn't. Water glasses were empty unless we specifically asked for more water, server never came back to ask how things were after dropping off food.  Never even offered dessert.  Other than two servers working never saw a bartender or manager.  Did not feel it was worth the pretty steep price when there are so many great options in Tampa.",

The menu is a little different but still has some of our favorite items such as the baba ganoush and spanakopita.  It\u2019s easily our favorite Mediterranean spot in Tampa!! I highly recommend any of the small plates as those are my favorite, but we have yet to try something we didn\u2019t love.  The service is great, sangria delicious and the price is just right!",
