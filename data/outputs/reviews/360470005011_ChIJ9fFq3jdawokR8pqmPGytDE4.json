The Yaki Udon, it came in small container compared to other Japanese restaurants I have ordered from, but not bad. The chicken teriyaki bento box was were I was soo disappointed. Mostly vegetables and tempura veggies I didnt want. My kids didnt even like it, usually that's their favorite chicken teriyaki. It had a small amount of chicken, barely a full breast of chicken. And a tiny serving of rice was on the side, (Imagine a icee cup). Definitely disappointed in the portions for those 2 meals, since they were a main dinner and most expensive. Other stores definitely serve more especially chicken teriyaki dinner. But the Taste was good (aside from overly added sesame seasoning on top of everything. Should be an option to not add it) Chicken tempura/Shrimp tempura/cali rolls all excellent and best thing out of my order!! Great so good.  Delivery took a bit long although I understand quarantine and protest have delayed alot. So I give them the benefit of the doubt, and once I called about the wait my food arrived 15 minutes later. So Great customer service. Will be giving them a try again. Just hope they work on portion size for the prices.",

Once someone finally came over they took our order but I had to constantly ask to have our water filled up. They then put our order in wrong and looked at us like they expected us to eat the wrong ordered food. They finally gave us our food but with no utensils. The food was good but the service was horrible. Definitely won't see me again.",

We had an emergency with our child and we asked for our food to go after it came to the table  (don't ask how long that took), and were ignored 3 times. My wife went to the waiters station to pack our own food to go after 10 minutes of waiting.

I come to NY on business 4-5 times per year. Although I stay in Manhattan, I always make a couple of trips to Ozu to visit the owner Lee, his wife Maggie, and the entire staff.  Lee and Maggie bought Ozu from the previous owners about a year ago so whatever review you read prior to then may not apply.  Everyone at Ozu is wonderful. Lee and Maggie have turned Ozu into a most enjoyable experience. The sushi is always fresh and reasonably priced. The service is friendly and unobtrusive.  I always sit at the sushi bar and have great conversations with Lee and several local regulars who  have nothing but praise for this place.  I highly recommend Ozu!",
