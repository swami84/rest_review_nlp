Came back recently during COVID, plenty of outdoor space, reservations were easy. Food as good as always.  The tacos are usually a bit unique which I love. Last time I had a lamb taco, kinda Mediterranean flavor, delicious. But I'll never forget I had a pork belly taco the first time I went and it was just this huge, rich, flavor-packed slab of meat. Crisp but melt in your mouth delicious.  They're not the cheapest tacos, but well worth it.",

We were pleasantly surprised to discover they offer bottomless mimosas on Saturday, we just didn't get there early enough to try them. The small is small, and they were packed, but we sat there for about 10 minutes with servers serving the two tables on either side of us and ignoring us. We finally asked one server of she was our server and she said no and walked off. Didn't offer to find out who our server was, get is started with drinks, or anything. I finally walked up to someone else and explained that we had been sitting a while and still didn't even have water. She apologized and immediately took our order and even gave is half off our margaritas, which was nice. The cucumber margarita had a nice flavor and a good strong kick.  The food came out fairly quickly once we did order but I was disappointed in the lack of flavor. I ordered the Amish chicken omelette and I ended up drowning it in salsa because of the bland flavor. My friend ordered 3 different tacos and only liked one of them. Neither one of us are picky eaters, their food just wasn't for us apparently. I honestly probably won't be going back.",

The only issue is that on Friday-Sunday they have strict rules regarding the minimum tacos that you can order. You must purchase at least 2 of the same taco. This prevented me from trying a variety of tacos, instead of trying 3 of their tacos (I wanted 1 of their fried fish, 1 shrimp and 1 barbacoa) I was restricted to only 1 since I had to order minimum of 2 tacos of the same kind?? This may work for groups but when your companion is vegan this does not work. The coconut flan was also well done.",

I was surprised that they would actually charge you for salsa and chips, and even moreso when it arrived. It was just a runny couple tablespoons of salsa with about 12 large chips. They charge 0.50 for more chips. Then, we ordered tacos. The tacos are a minimum of 2 per order, so my fiancee and I ordered 3 different kinds to try a couple. I asked the waiter if they could put the 3 different tacos on 2 plates. He said that they couldn't do that. We got the fish, lamb merguez, and the barbacoa. The fish was good. The hibiscus tortilla made them look cool. The lamb was a sausage, which was a little unusual in a taco, but not bad. The barbacoa was stringy. Overall, I think this place is overpriced. I can't say that I'll be coming back.",

When we walked in we were greeted with a friendly man up front. Then we sat out table, sat at our table some more, annndddd continued to sit at our table. So I glance around to see two servers just chatting away and laughing leaned up against the counter. So we still didn't say anything. After 10 min of just sitting there with not a single wait staff to even get our drink order we left. When stopped why we were leaving we didn't get a \"oh I'm so sorry let's get you taken care of right away!\" Because that's how we would have handled it being we have both worked in the food industry, we got a \"oh ....sorry\" like seriously! Never again!",

The food was delicious and a huge hit with all our guests. First of all, these are some of the tastiest tacos and sides in Chicago. Second of all, the food is prepared in a gluten-free kitchen. This was a huge consideration for us because one of our best friends has celiac disease and has to be very careful with cross contamination. Many places use gluten free ingredients but do not follow the cross contamination processes necessary to make the food safe for people with celiac. Richard Vallejo was very responsive to our questions and worked to create a great menu for us.

It is well cooked with a crust and then put with a combination of a mildly spicy jalapeno slaw and a cooling coconut sauce.  The vibrant hibiscus tortilla alone is stunning and then the flavor comes in and it is a must try experience.  The barbacoa is perfectly soft and delicious.  It was succulent without being greasy and was paired with the perfect toppings that held up to the strong braised meat taste.  Takito has a homemade tortilla for each taco to enhance the flavor.  The sauce they added to each matched the meat and the experience as a whole.  I am not just coming back, but I am coming back soon and with friends.",

We truly enjoyed everything we ordered. The stand-out in the group was the roasted winter squash! Very flavorful with spice and a little kick. Also noteworthy was the sauce on the fish tacos - really added something different to the usual mix of fish tacos in the city. I would like to try them in-restaurant as I imagine the breading would be crispier. That said, the breading is great - not too heavy and not dripping with grease.  We will definitely be ordering again and visiting in person to try more options on the menu!",

We got to sit outside on a beautiful night.  #chicagoweatherhasbeencrazy  The food was so amazing.  #imafatpig polenta was creamy, cheesy, bacon-NESS. whats not to love. could've ate the whole dish myself. heart of palms salad was so refreshing and crisp tacos.  we had the crispy redfish and the lamb chirizo.  both amazing.  would highly recommend them. chocolate ganache. yummy, however i didnt like the aesthetic of the dish it was in. if you didnt dig down with your spoon, you didnt get the chocolate. rice pudding was creamy and sweet!  MMMMmmm  They have lots of different kinds of drinks.  Margarita flavors galore.  Long list of whatever you could possibly want!  Only thing that I found annoying was that you cant mix and match tacos.  All 3 the same.  Oh, and it was reasonable in price.  Valet was $10.  It was damn good.  I would definitely be back",

        "caption": "Let's just get this out of the way: the tacos are expensive. Not lobster dinner expensive, but not the cheap eats tacos are meant to be. Three - five dollars per taco is stretching the limits of credulity. Still, the tacos are good.  We ordered the Alaskan King Crab tacos and their special, which involved pork shoulder and chapulines (crickets). The crab tacos were excellent: buttery and rich with a kick of spice. The pork shoulder tacos were great too, though the chewiness of the chapulines was a bit unnerving compared with the soft give of the thinly shredded pork shoulder. We also ordered the tomatillo pistachio salsa, which was delicious and surprisingly complex thanks to the nuttiness from the pistachios. So the food is great, albeit a bit overpriced.  The ambiance was classic Wicker Park, and the lighting is really attractive. The chairs, it must be mentioned, are not very comfortable--too high and too metal. That said: if you want fancied up tacos, head here.",
