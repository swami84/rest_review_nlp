We ordered the 3 different Ramens on the menu (tonkotsu, shoyu and miso) and we were very disappointed with the presentation,  flavours and very little vegetables in each Ramen. The waiter was very friendly, but he forgot to offer us the drinks. We decided to give another try and went back today and what an amazing experience we had. Abdullah (I hope I'm spelling his name correctly) was our waiter and he showed and explained the menu. We decided to go with his recommendation and we tried the \"tapas\", assorted taste of really good food. We also had sushi Tyger Roll and Katsu Don, that was divine. We will definitely go back.",
