As we sat upstairs savoring our lamb tagines, blissfully unaware of what was to come in the next few months, I mentioned that some of my friends had recently been on vacation to Morocco, but that they had gotten tired of eating only tagine on their trip. To which J\u00e9r\u00e9mie just laughed and said that this was not possible.  Three and a half months later, I can vouch for the accuracy of his statement. Thank you, Zerza, for staying open and feeding me through the entire coronavirus shutdown. Sometimes I was so stressed during that period that food had no taste, and I would only eat once a day. But when it feels like the whole world is ending outside, nothing can make it better like a great home-cooked tagine. I don't know what kind of crack they put in it that keeps me coming back, but this stuff is comfort food in the truest sense - it is a warm hug when social isolation renders actual human contact impossible.  Five stars for the food (six for the duck confit), five stars for the music.",
