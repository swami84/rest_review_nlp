Instead Friends Ramen offers smaller bowls that way you can try more than one flavor ramen because they do have a lot more options that your typical ramen spot.They also have these little card hanging everywhere as soon as you walk in. Visitors can write something nice on there and hang it up, very cute. If it weren't for the small bowl alternative Im not sure I would keep coming back to this spot. The overall flavor of the ramen is just okay but definitely not packed full of flavor like you would get elsewhere. A cute little spot none the less if youre looking to try multiple flavors or are just looking for a lighter meal.  Also if you like sushi, Friends Sushi is right next door and it is sooo good.",

The gyozas had sour taste to them, which makes me think they were on the verge of being spoiled. \u201cRamen\u201d was served in a disposable black plastic bowl. The contents of the bowl were: questionable looking white  liquid, semi-cold spaghetti noodles, and for 2 variations of ramen that we got, one came with chicken nuggets from Costco and the other one with something that used to be a pork belly a week ago. All with the price tag of $65. To be fair we did have 2 bottles of sake, but even those didn\u2019t make the food taste less terrible Service was nice.",

I arrived at 8:30 am and the waiter pressed us to order before he even offered to sit down. So we order, in the end not that cheap, the ramen has $ 17 without tax and tips. We sit down, finally the waiter brings us our dishes in plastic bowls and cups. We quietly watch TV with the NBA game and he turns off the TV. We ask if he can put it back on until we finish eating and he says no because otherwise \"we risk never leaving\". I thought it was a joke and actually not at all. Next time if they really want to shut down, don't accept us.  Quite disappointed by this restaurant. Not so cheap ($ 17 for a Ramen before tax and tips) and obvious that the server only waited for us to leave (arrived at 8:30 pm whereas restaurant opens until 10pm). Won't come again.  (Original) Plut\u00f4t d\u00e9\u00e7ue de ce restaurant. J'ai appel\u00e9 avant d'y aller et on me dit que la cuisine ferme \u00e0 8h45. J'arrive \u00e0 8h30 et le serveur nous presse pour commander avant m\u00eame qu'il nous propose d'\u00eatres assis. Donc on commande, au final pas si cheap que \u00e7a, le ramen a $17 sans tax et tips. On s'assoit, finalement le serveur nous apporte nos plats dans des bols et cups en plastiques. On regarde tranquillement la TV avec le match de NBA et la il coupe la TV. On demande s'il peut la remettre le temps qu'on finisse de manger et il dit non car sinon \"on risque de ne jamais partir\". Je pensais que c'\u00e9tait une blague et en fait pas du tout. La prochaine fois si ils veulent vraiment fermer, qu'ils ne nous acceptent pas.  Quite disappointed by this restaurant.

The noodle is very fresh but not the typical ramen you might have eaten before. With one piece of pork n a quarter of an egg...It's decent.  The okonomiyaki... However was little bit letdown...It's not really authentic at all..It's basically like a larger version of takoyaki without the octopus.. Mostly cabbage and batter... Flavor was one dimension with all the Kewpie mayonnaise... Still kept with bonito flakes and nori flakes... Not so special and relatively small...For $9..  It's alright for lunch or on the go... Service was fast.. Just won't go that often.. Three stars for the effort.....",

The portions here are a little strange - $6 gets you a tiny bowl (basically a cup) of the dish or pay $15 for a large bowl (which is way too big for a normal person portion). So I'm not too keen on the pricing (it's a little on the high end, even for downtown ramen/rice). I probably would give this place a second chance, but stick with the small cup. Overall, a little disappointing considering the cost factor where there are other choices nearby",

Rice bowls are neat and worth eating. It's hard to recommend it to ramen lovers, but it seems to be okay for a meal. The interior decor reminds me of Korea's Izakaya.

The very first time I was at the restaurant, the staff explained the whole idea behind the small portion sizes: to try multiple different flavors of the ramen. However, now they have the big bowl which is a perfect size if you're already sure of which flavor you want! The decor and music is so aesthetically pleasing. They even play older animes on the TVs. The staff is sooooo nice and eager to build a good and lasting relationship with the customers. I have also never had a bad bowl of food here. The chicken karaage ramen is a MUST TRY! Definitely keep your mind open towards this small hole in the wall restaurant. Although the portion sizes are small and meant to be ordered in quantities of 2 or 3+ different flavors, the restaurant has amazing staff and charm that can't be passed up.",

However, there are a couple of things that I think should be improved: - background music was RnB style, not really matching the interior and the cuisine - if a restaurant/cafe claims to serve ramen (Asian noodle soup), it is unacceptable and disappointing to get spaghetti instead of Asian noodles, especially if they look as if they were bought in a supermarket - price for the regular bowl (proper meal) was 15$, which I think is quite expensive.",

I ordered a Sapporo draft and while it went down smoothly but hoped there were more options. The first table we sat at had this wet mop stench and we ended up moving to a table with super heavy wooden chairs.

For people who really enjoys Ramen this is a big no no.   But for the slightly more chic crowd, this goes along with the \"less is more\" idea. The place is tiny, about 8 tiny tables made of wood blocks, not mean for you to sit long and work on your paper, and for w small place, high turn over is important.  The food is actually good, everything we tried was quite impressive, but not \"I will be back soon\" good.  The broth base is the same, just adding a few twists to it.  The qty is tiny, about 2 full bites and it s gone.  It is surely good for snack.  A single bowl is about 1/4 of the real thing (don't let the broth fool you).  I personally prefer the Ramen at Misoya, it is original.  Did someone say Ramen-san?",

The first visit I had no clue how tiny my $6 bowl of chicken ramen would be but it is a third or a quarter size of a traditional bowl served in other restaurants but I enjoyed the flavor and got a $3 melon soda so I spent $10 the first time and made note that the seated benches are tiny so it's not a comfortable sitting situation if you have back issues or you are taller than 5 feet 2 you are going to feel VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.   Second visit I tried a combo for $15 and I got 2 tiny soups a tiny gyoza dumpling and the server didn't charge me extra for me wanting to substitute out the coke products for a melon soda. I was happy with my second visit even though I hate the ugly and loud hip hop that plays here 24/7.  The server explained it's his music selection so I suggested other genres of music and he smiled and said he'd consider it.  Today was my 3rd and final visit.  Today I ordered a combination again, asked for a can of melon soda rather than a coke beverage, chose 2 tiny soups and a tiny hot rice and was charged $22.50 rather than the fixed combination rate of $15 because my waitress isn't fluent with English and didn't tell me there would be a price hike because I picked a different soup and the can of melon soda. The music continues to play loud and of course it's house music and hip hop.  This is my final visit because I'd rather spend $14 receiving a giant portion of well prepared traditional Japanese ramen than blow $22 in a loud restaurant with uncomfortable seating, and servers who can't understand you.  The music here is uninteresting, uninspiring and I actually asked a few other guests if they enjoyed the music and none of these guests spoke up but I'm here to say save your money and get the whole portion of ramen elsewhere and you'll leave satisfied and less broke.  I don't want to order ramen as an appetizer also the more shallow bowls don't retain the heat of the soup so it's half cold by the time you've eaten your half portion anyway!",

The ramen was also more pan-Asian than Japanese in my opinion.  The setting was nice and the service was quick and pleasant. Normally I would give 4 stars for a place like this, but the small serving size really irked me. It is a good idea for people to try different kinds of ramen, but at least give an option for a regular-sized bowl.",

I walked up to the restaurant at around 9:40. I was just looking at the menu/seeing when they close when a young man came to the door to invite me and a friend in. We went in and sat immediately. I saw that they had been cleaning up and I felt bad about coming in, but thought if I was literally waved in, it wouldn't be a big deal.  Then, got the menu and the server gives me an incredibly rude \"yeah so last call is in like 2 minutes...\" and just stands there... alright I think, I can order fast, I know what I want. So I order what I wanted and the server sighs and says \"that's it?\" implying I should order more. Now, I get that I should make them making us food worthwhile, so I double up on the order ($33 of food). The waiter then asks about DRINKS. So I order 2 more drinks. At this point I've spent 10x what I expected but, whatever.  Food comes out and my friend and I literally scarf it down. Probably ate all of it in 4-5 minutes. I was trying to leave as soon as possible. We are paid and out by 9:56. It's not even 10 yet. Before we leave, the server asks \"are you from Chicago?\" in the most condescending manner I've ever heard. This is after I gave him a ~$10 tip on a ~$30 bill.  So overall, this is a restaurant I wouldn't recommend as the service simply doesn't understand hospitality. I was bummed because I liked the food, service was just god awful.",

I ordered one of the combos with gyozas, a salad, and ramen. Their ramen bowls are small, but the idea is to get something else or multiple ramen bowls, as their are very cheap ($6 a bowl). The combo was perfect and came out immediately. It was beyond delicious. I loved it and was so pleased to find a great hole in the wall place to eat.",

So this place was my test run and I can say I was not disappointed:  1. The appetizers were excellent -- the chicken dumplings tasty and sweet, the fried chicken addictively and delicious  2. I went for the veg Tai Men? Ramen and it was pretty great. My friends ordered different kinds and used a generous helping of chili sauce to account for taste  3. The prices are excellent  4. The bathroom view (it's a one way mirror from the inside and umm it gave me a lot of anxiety and I'm not sure the world needs that sort of novelty. At all)  5. The service, simple, no fuss and very helpful  A few things to keep in mind:  1. No reservations 2. Limited space and really not for large groups, our party of 4 was at a table which faced the main door and each time it opened the lovely Chicago winter air hit us hard (we had to move and squeeze in a 2 person booth, something our server tried to stop us from) 3. Realllyyyyy limited alcohol selection (so do the boozing before or after)  All in all, highly recommend and will return",

I would not recommend this place for any true Ramen lovers you will be disappointed. They only serve a miso base which technically seems like they just use a squeeze tube of miso and some hot water boil some noodles and throw in some ingredients.

The Karaage and Yam appetizers were also very tasty.  If you have room at the end the crepe cakes are also a must, great light sweet way to end the meal.  The ramen was perfectly hot as it's made to order so not sure why others thought they were warm.  Pro tips: get extra lettuce with the Karaage appetizer and an extra side of the spicy mayo no matter what you order as it's great to dip anything in.",

It kind of made it hard to concentrate on the food and conversation I was trying to have at my table.",

Everything I had was delicious, and the service was friendly. I tried about half the menu, loved the crab ramen, crunchy shrimp, and pork belly and rice especially. All very reasonable pricing, especially for a trendy near North location. Ate like kings for 2, total came to just under $60. New favorite local ramen spot!",
