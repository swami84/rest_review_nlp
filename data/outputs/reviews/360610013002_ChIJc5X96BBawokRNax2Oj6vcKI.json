Just not classy for a Manhattan location. The food is low quality and the staff, while friendly enough, was unorganized and inefficient. Took far too long from when we sat down to when we received a menu and water.  Also, music was too loud (for breakfast), dated and the acoustics for it being a restaurant, we're terrible. I could not hear the person directly across from me at the table, and my parents had to take out their hearing aids because of so much kitchen noise. Lots of potential, however. It's a great old space, but lacks the luster one expects from a downtown Manhattan restaurant attached to a hotel.",

The waiter was clearly a new guy, still under training, and clearly not very well trained. I was by myself and I specifically mentioned I am looking for a table, not a bar seat, and he still took me to the bar. I said I'd like a table, and he told me 'No'. I said \"What do you mean by no? I can see empty tabes here.' He said \"these are reserved\". I was annoyed (because it was obvious he was lying), and asked him if I can talk to his supervisor or the manager. That is when the waiter changed his tone and took me to a table and sat me there. When the manager or some one senior (or at least it seemed so) came to my table to take the order, I told him about this incident, and guess what told me?? 'It's all normal!\". Did he mean lying is normal??? I will not go back to this tavern again - the food isn't the best, and given it is Manhattan, there are way better places with better service available!",

As we stood by the door for several minutes waiting to be seated, another couple walked in behind us and the host immediately strode over, warmly embraced them, and then seated them. My friend said, \"Let's go,\" and we were about to, when the host returned and seated us. We looked over the menus, made our choices, and then both pulled out our laptops because this was a working lunch. Time passed and passed as 3 waiters plus the host circulated, cleared tables, took orders, and the place slowly filled up. Nobody came to our table, not even to bring a glass of water. We tried to signal for service, but were ignored. An hour later (no kidding, I checked my watch), when we had finished our business, still no one had come to our table. So we left. On our way out, we mentioned to the nearest waiter that we had been there an hour with no service. She said sorry, but the host had told her we were taken care of. Really!? There weren't even water glasses on our table.",

My son ordered the chicken fingers which were very good white meat tenderloins with a light breading. My wife and I shared a French onion soup(was very good and traditional in style) and the shrimp scampi, and the scampi was the highlight of our meal. The pasta was cooked perfectly 'al dente' and the addition of the asparagus and baby tomatoes were an unusual addition but tasted so good and really rounded out the dish. My wife who doesn't normally eat asparagus devoured them! The sauce was light with just the right amount of salt and the 5 shrimp were average in size and cooked well. This is the best scampi I've had in a long time.",

It was very quiet when we first got there...a Tuesday night, after all, and not too many people staying out late. The happy hour is very good; runs from 4-8pm. You can get a variety of wines, beers and mixed drinks for $6 each. That's a bargain in NY! The bartender was very pleasant, and so was the atmosphere. I love that it's in an old church.  The outside is lovely, and the inside is pleasant too. They even have a leftover confessional.  Later, it did get a big crowd for a while...seemed like they all knew one another and were celebrating an event together. I really liked this place. Will be dragging my husband there in the near future.",

In addition, we have eggplant polpette meatballs as an appetizer. They are amazing, it is incredible to think that they are vegetarians. Since both sides we enjoy this is more like the essence of the mushroom dessert Corn Brewer. Both are great! The only bad part of the meal is the broccoli rabe which tastes like propane. They generously took out from our bill. Too much called dessert, they brought a gift from the Oreo Fragrant Cheese Roll from the bill chef. It is not disappointing. The atmosphere here is buttocks but the restaurant has a lot of background noise. This is certainly not a romantic place.

She was speaking to the manager most of the time about dating Cuban men and her personal life. I sent the duck back after two bites without saying anything about it being bad. Normally a waitress seeing a full plate go back would ask if there was a problem.she did not. She was on her cell phone numerous times. When I asked for my check she took her time and when I gave my credit card instead of running my bill she responded to a text on her phone and then surged talking to the manager again. After staring them down for a few minutes she was told in Spanish that I was looking at them and came to collect payment. Worst service I have ever experienced in NYC. Not sure which was worse the service or the food. Either way, I would never return to this establishment",
