The bar has tables and couches, giving it a cozy feel- but again, not crowded. I'm looking forward to returning in warm weather to enjoy the outdoor space, equipped with fireplaces. But since it's only November now, I certainly won't wait until spring to return. Tagliatelle calls me back, and soon!",

Once we placed drink orders, we were not asked nor given cream or sugar for our coffee.  Once we cream and sugar, we realized we didn't have coffee spoons; I used my butter knife. They auctioned our food off (\"Who got the avocado toast?\") rather than delivering to the correct seat numbers. It is a small menu; we all got some variation of the same things . My food arrived cold. It was difficult to flag down service for condiments/maintenance items. I had the corned beef sandwich; it was okay, not remarkable. The patio was lovely. Maybe no one else in my group noticed these things, but I worked in hospitality for 20 years. As isolated incidents, nothing terrible happened. But collectively, the lack of attention to detail didn't make me feel very welcome and I'm just not likely to return.",

        "caption": "I love City Mouse. I started coming here maybe a few months after it opened because there was so little hype about it. It\u2019s a low-key restaurant / bar flowing off the lobby of the Ace Hotel. The menu is pretty much standard American diner fare, but with an upscale execution. And, when I say upscale, I don\u2019t mean it in a fancy-pants, foie-gras-in-random-foods kind of way. To give you an example, The Breakfast Sandwich is just... good. And, not because of any exotic pricy ingredients. The bread is soft and some sort of pita or naan-like texture with a slight toasting. The sausage and eggs are seemingly unremarkable, but somehow just perfect every time. There\u2019s a hash brown inside that manages to be balanced in being crispy and soft (like how I like it at Waffle Houses). There\u2019s a little of sweet jam to balance the saltiness. The Sandwich: It. Just. Works. Everything from their dinner dishes to their simple oatmeal is just better than what their names suggests. I can\u2019t really explain or replicate it. Plus, the servers are friendly, and there\u2019s a good vibe here. I don\u2019t feel that mild sense of haughtiness from other people relaxing or eating here like I do from say... across the street or elsewhere in West Loop. People bring their dogs, their kids, or whatever else inside. There\u2019s also now a flower shop and a coffee place attached. City Mouse is just a nice little spot. It is getting more popular each time I come. Hope it stays true to it\u2019s beginnings.",

At $5 for a single bite, it's not on the cheap side but it's absolutely delicious. Most dishes are perfect for sharing, and pastas in particular are a standout. Do not overlook the desserts -- a dining companion proclaimed a take on St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake to be \"the best thing I've ever eaten\" (while another dining companion ordered a few more Country Mouse appetizers for dessert -- they are that good). Worth noting that it can get loud at peak times of the evening, so not necessarily the best spot if you're hard of hearing (though outdoor seating is available and they seem to have heat lamps even in cooler months).",

This is a bright and open floorplan with communal tables and smaller tables in the dining room, and lower, cushioned seating up front. It's noticeably louder in the dining room, but less conducive to eating in front area.  We started with coconut, banana, chocolate coffee cake. The chocolate is marbled within, the top is a brown suger crumble. It's pretty sweet, but perfect with black coffee. I really did not notice the coconut. Avocado toast was great, though a personal preference would be for toast that isn't so hard and difficult to cut through. The Gas Station breakfast sandwich is like an elite sausage McMuffin  stuffed with perfectly crisp hashbrowns. All that is made just a bit sweet by grape jelly lightly spread on the English muffin. Accompanied by \"fancy fruit\" - berries, pineapple, no junky melon.  The bottom line is this place has a target audience of hotel guests, nearby office workers, and neighborhood residents, so the modest menu is essentially upscale comfort food. Though it's a bit noisy, it's  modern and comfortable. The staff is casual, young, a bit inexperienced, but making efforts - they have a lot of people on deck so service is fast, plus everyone was helpful.",

There was a lovely room behind the row of tables where we were seated, it had a glass wall and drapes that were drawn once a party was seated there, but it looked like a nice setting for a special dinner or occasion.

It was obviously not a service animal because it was poorly behaved and trying to climb on the table. Other friends of the dog owner stopped to visit at that table and they were picking up the dog and playing/petting vigorously in their arms so the dog fur was getting spread around but no one at the restaurant said a word to them. 2) our table was near the door to leave the hotel. A man stood next to our table and lit his cigarette and started smoking it before he went outside.  He stood trying to light it for a while in front of an employee before he succeeded and again nothing was said to stop him.",
