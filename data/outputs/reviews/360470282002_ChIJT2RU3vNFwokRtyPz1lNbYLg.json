So let\u2019s get into it, I\u2019ve had their iced coffee, Greek frappe, Dalgona, and basically any other iced caffeinated beverage on the menu and I have never been dissatisfied- seriously so good! My favorite is their iced cappuccino OMG! Their crepes are so delicious and can be customized to your liking. They have ICE CREAM, and other desserts including Macaroons which are ALWAYS fresh (not like some other places that will serve them stale and dry). Seriously love this place, they are always coming up with fun new drink & food recipes based on the season or holiday and they not only look good but actually taste great!! I highly recommend this place to everyone\u2014- oh and thanks to the owners and staff the place is ALWAYS IMMACULATE! 10/10",

Customer service is amazing the girls that work here know what they are doing and are amazing. It gets busy at times but definitely worth the wait.

Every person who works there is willing to customize any coffee, crepe, or panini to make for an incredible experience.  The food is clearly high quality and fresh, from the sweet crepes to savory crepes and even the cakes and other treats in the display cases. The coffee is always fresh (the espresso goes from bean to grinds in just seconds and the drip is brewed almost continuously guaranteeing freshness and hot temperature) and they have so many different flavors to add to make your coffee truly yours.  The store hours are great too because they are open for my morning coffee and late night snack! This is a great addition to the Bath Beach/Bensonhurst neighborhood.",

I was picturing a quiet cozy atmosphere but it wasn't the case; there was a football game shown on a mounted TV and we can hear other customers' conversations since we're all sitting so close. The employees were friendly and left us to ponder a while on our choices. Now onto the food: the menu offered both sweet and savory crepes and drinks as well. My sister and I each ordered a sweet crepe and flavored lattes at the front. The total was about $28, which is surprisingly high for South BK. Everything was delicious but I don't think it can justify the cost. I suppose if I am craving crepes and don't want to venture too far, I might return. Still, I think the prices are not fit for this working class area.",
