Tonight I am saddened to say, Casa Ora and it\u2019s future patrons deserve to know the tragedy that was my experience.  It started off with exceptional cocktails. Well crafted and timely delivered....  Then, as the night got cooler the experience fell off terribly. First, as we asked them to turn heaters up. Three different individuals came by to make different bs excuses - including, my favorite, \u201cwe would get fined if we made it warmer.\u201d  We were \u201coffered\u201d a wait inside for inside seats at 25% capacity.  However, when we peered inside it was packed wall-to-wall with people. If that\u2019s 25% capacity, I can\u2019t imagine what a full house is like.  Out of courtesy and consideration for the hardship the restaurant may be in, we decided to wait.  Long story short, we waited more than an hour and a half for food - the kind servers continuously insisting it would \u201conly be 5 minutes longer.\u201d  Once our food arrived, it was mediocre at best. The scallops were good but the Pabellon was VERY dry and overcooked.  They tried their best to comp us with a drink but the experience was unacceptable.  When we brought issue with the bill, the owner brushed us off.  We got to dinner at 8:15 and left at 11:30 exhausted, offended, and appalled.",

The ceviche and cake in particular were exploding with multiple layers of flavor. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the area! We\u2019ll definitely be back :)",

Finally went there last week and it was INCREDIBLE. They've done an amazing job with their outside with the planters and well-distanced yet adequate seating, fun music. Best of all, the drinks are awesome and food/apps were delicious. Get the tamarind cocktail if they have it. The service from Juan was top-notch with on-point recommendations for all courses. After Winson became a destination restaurant in the neighborhood, didn't think it would be possible to have another. I think Casa Ora has the potential to be the 2nd one! Just hope outdoor dining lasts for a long time or there's another system figured out. P.S. the menus signed by Ora were a nice touch!",

It fits perfectly in this place to know that it is a dream come true of its owner, after several years of constant learning; It is a place with almost purely familiar attention in which they demonstrate with their attention and with their flavors that love overflows in the things they do .... Their theme is Venezuelan food and who can resist some mandras (who had more 3 years without feeling the taste and they tasted the homemade ones in Venezuela) and some teque\u00f1os of entry or even some empanadas or some cupcakes !!!! We also ate a delicious cachapa with cheese and cream (they told us that they prepare it themselves) and a patac\u00f3n (their roasted meat has the family secret because the taste is delicious Omg), and to close with a flourish the dessert was a mousse of parchita and a four milks (whose caramel has been the most delicious of my life), I recommend it 1000%, it is that cozy, familiar and beautiful place, take care of every detail (until your bathroom is simply beautiful) would come back again, what Super recommend.  (Original) Hay una f\u00f3rmula secreta en la vida: so\u00f1ar cosas grandes y saborear peque\u00f1os placeres!!!! Encaja perfectamente en este lugar al saber que es un sue\u00f1o hecho realidad de su due\u00f1o, luego de varios a\u00f1os de constante aprendizaje; es un lugar con atenci\u00f3n casi netamente familiar en el que demuestran con su atenci\u00f3n y con sus sabores que el amor desborda en las cosas que hacen.... Su tem\u00e1tica es la comida venezolana y quien se puede resistir a unas mandocas (que ten\u00eda m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os sin sentir el sabor y sab\u00edan a las hechas en casa en Venezuela) y a unos teque\u00f1os de entrada o hasta unas empanadas o unos pastelitos!!!! Tambi\u00e9n comimos una deliciosa cachapa con queso y nata (nos contaron que la preparan ellos mismos) y un patac\u00f3n (su carne mechada tiene el secreto de familia porque el sabor es Omg riqu\u00edsimo), y para cerrar con broche de oro el postre fue un mousse de parchita y una cuatro leches (cuyo caramelo ha sido el m\u00e1s delicioso de mi vida), lo recomiendo al 1000%, es ese lugar acogedor, familiar y hermoso, cuidan cada detalle ( hasta su ba\u00f1o es simplemente hermoso) volver\u00eda de nuevo, lo s\u00faper recomiendo.",
