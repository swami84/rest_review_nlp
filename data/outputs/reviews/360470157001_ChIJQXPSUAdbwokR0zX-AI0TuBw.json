If you're interested in unlimited champagne for basically free then it is great. The food and service, however, has really fallen by the wayside. We had a reservation and the basically seated us in the alcove of the front door which was freezing and very uncomfortable. There were people looming over us the entire time we sat. A server was nowhere in sight, I ended up having to ask the hostess for almost everything we wanted. The coffee was unpalatable. My dining partners needed steak knives to cut their English muffins and the eggs were overdone. I suggested this place based on good experiences I had there a few years ago, I ended up looking like a fool. I'm sure if we were drinking, these flaws wouldn't have been so obvious.  Positives: the breakfast sausage was really delicious and my truffle frittata was also yummy. You can go and not drink - the menu goes down to $16.95 if you don't opt for the unlimited booze brunch. The back room continues to dazzle - it is truly beautiful back there. They also have a small room downstairs for parties/private dinners.",

I had checked out a few places in the area to host this party, and it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that Scottadito blew away the competition, in terms of the beautiful space, menu, service, and cost.  From start to finish, every person I dealt with to plan the party was professional, patient, knowledgeable, and made the process entirely stress-free for me (special shout-out to the delightful bartender, Judy, and super personable owner, Donald). The day of the party, the atrium room was set up beautifully when I arrived almost two hours prior to the start of the brunch (thank you, Sam!), and it was a perfect space for my guests to mingle before being seated for the plated brunch. Dino, the awesome head waiter, and the entire wait staff were extremely attentive, ensuring everyone\u2019s glass was topped off, while not being intrusive. Superb service all around.  And then there was the food\u2026 I was able to choose three entrees for everyone to enjoy. You read that right \u2014 everyone was plated all three entrees. I chose the Uova Fiorentino, Pane Dolce, and Gnocchetti di Spinachi. How does a restaurant manage to perfect such vastly different entrees for such a large party? Scottadito pulled it off and then some. And it was topped off with the most delicious Torta al Cioccolato Cake. My friends couldn\u2019t stop gushing about how impressed they were with it all, with one friend telling me that she\u2019s trying to think of a special occasion just so she can host her party there.  If you\u2019re looking to host a party with top-notch food and service, look no further than Scottadito. And even if you\u2019re just looking to have an intimate meal (it\u2019s a great date spot too!) \u2014 go to Scottadito!",

Located on a busy block in Park Slope this delightful Italian spot doesn't look like your typical boozy brunch establishment at first glance. Beautiful rustic interiors and a live fireplace give the restaurant a pretty classy feel. They even have a lower level which feels like a wine cellar to accommodate private events and large parties.  Brunch is $25 a pop for an entr\u00e9e and unlimited mimosas or champagne for about 90 minutes. The offerings consisted of a variety of a egg preparations, a few salads, a few types of pasta and some other brunch classics like French toast. I was quite tempted to try out one of the egg based dishes but ultimately decided to go with the spinach gnocchi and was throughly delighted that I did. The house made gnocchi was rolled in a spinach based dough as opposed to a potato based one and it made all the difference when paired with the mimosas as we didn't feel like it was bloating us up. The mimosas themselves were pretty good and our wonderful server Gina ensured that our glasses were always full. They also had a range of brunch cocktails for $5 which looked promising and which I will surely return to try.  All the staff at the restaurant right from the hostess to all the servers were exceedingly friendly and hospitable and they absolutely enhanced an already lovely experience. I will definitely be back here for brunch and for other meals as well.",

Will start off with the amazing staff they have and the service which was excellent. The food was delicious and it just looks good. Look at those pictures haha. Well, i ordered the egg Benedict and my gf order their special burger. The egg perfectly cooked and as soon as you put your knife, the yolk starts running down. It comes with a lovely homemade fries and salad. the burger was probably the best thing on the menu. The mixture of veal, pork and beef gives a wild taste to the burger but at the same time really delicious. My gf doesn\u2019t like beef but she loves the burger. It comes with avocado, cheese and bacon and sunny side up. Both of these meals were included with the meal. Go and enjoy the food there \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24",

Our server was extremely pleasant and made sure our glasses were full the entire time, even if I only had taken one sip. The bottomless brunch is a spectacular deal. Here we have the Nutella banana French toast which was very delicious and filling, and the fried eggs with potatoes and side salad which was light, well cooked and very fresh. The interior is well decorated and charming with great vibes and it feels very spacious. Highly recommended!!",

The food is awesome, the staff makes you feel at home, the Chef is creative and his food is absolutely delicious. the Owner is genuine and gracious; he is a sweetheart; so is his entire family. Sammy is the best; poised, with such a flair. If you have never been there, you owe it to yourselves to go; you will have a wonderful dining experience. We've told all of our friends about this place. I have never had an ordinary meal there. Everything tastes so good. You deserve a treat. My husband and I loves to get away and enjoy their food. My Grandmother was a chef, and I know good food when I taste it!",

We really enjoyed the ALL YOU CAN DRINK MIMOSAS OR CHAMPAGNE FOR BRUNCH. I was told this brunch special ($19)  is very popular (naturally!). The service was very good and our glasses were filled frequently. The ambience of the place was also very good. This is a very good place for spending very relaxing hours with friends.  For the brunch, I had the Gnocchetti di Spinachi (pasta), which my friend recommended. It was very good. (although I had to add a little bit of salt).  They had Manhattan quality with Brooklyn price.  I highly recommned this place. *****",

During the planning phases of the event I also received a lot of good advice and assistance from the manager.   The wine cellar is a lovely room - and the upstairs room which accommodates even more guests is also quite lovely.  I highly recommend this restaurant for events and for every day dining out.",

We order two of the specials, (Fettuccine seafood for me, Lobster pasta for her), and then wait 1 hour for them to give us food. Meanwhile the bread they gave us tasted like stale cornbread with some weird sauce to go with it that tasted like Chef Boyardee  with Tabasco splashed in it. Worst Italian sauce ever. We finally get our food and its the blandest crap I've ever eaten. For $25+ a meal I expect a little more flavor. Have the chefs ever tasted actual Italian food? Nice Atmosphere, Crap food.",

This was a frittata! No, it was the exact same thing I had the last time just with different ingredients inside but with a higher pricetag.",
