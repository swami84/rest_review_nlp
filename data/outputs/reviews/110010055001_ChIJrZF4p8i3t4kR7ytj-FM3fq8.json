We sat downstairs, enjoyed live music, and was able to enjoy items off both menus. The mushroom Risotto was amazing and even better the next day, my son devoured his flatbread, and husband really enjoyed his meal (fish special of some sort, smelled and looked great). There are numerous dining options these days, and hospitality is rare. My server Sean and the rest of the staff really hit it out of the park and have already shared experience with friends planning upcoming weekends to the city.",

Several people in my party had salmon and I noted that each ate the entire dish. I ordered lamb and spinach cannelloni. Delicious. Each dish and dessert was enticingly presented.  The only negative was the coffee, at least for my taste. Too strong.",

On Thursday, February 27, I checked the website for their hours and called for a 9:00am Saturday breakfast reservation. Left my phone number and everything. When I met my friend visiting DC there at 9:00am....locked doors! I checked the website, and it still said 9:00am. Still says that now, in fact. We waited until 9:15 before going to a different restaurant. When I went back to share about the humiliation and inconvenience I experienced this morning, I was not allowed to talk to a manager, and all I got was a weak, \"I'm sorry.\"  So, the error was four-fold:  1. The website was wrong. Bad marketing 2. The staff who took my reservation clearly didn't know the opening time on Saturday. Bad staff training. 3. Despite the fact that I gave them my phone number, at no point did anyone notice the problem with my reservation and call me to fix it. Bad customer service. 4. When I made them aware of this, there was no effort to make amends. None. Bad customer retention.",

The atmosphere is cozy and they really don't have a dress code, I mean just dress appropriately (I was able to wear jeans with some tears and a button up long sleeve shirt). At about 8:00 the restaurant definitely started getting busier as I noticed most of the tables and bar area became full. The restaurant can definitely get noisy, but nothing unbearable and definitely wouldn't let that stop you from enjoying this place.

However, our dining experience took an upturn with the very professional and friendly service provided by our outstanding server Tania.

The wine offerings were well balanced with the menu and appetizers, salads and main courses had a modern Italian spin. The only complaint I would have is their use of seasonings and spices which were very much understated. However it was apparent that the pasta was freshly made and the portions were generous. The background music-cool jazz- was a bit disconcerting but helped drown out the drunk pretentious couple next to us.  Overall a very good experience and we would come back again",

Before I go further I must compliment the kitchen on the quality of the food. It was good. Not amazing, but worth the price.  When the waiter (who appeared to be the only waiter on the upper level, maybe even the manager) took our group's order I gave him my drink, appetizer and entree all at once (he never asked me to to withhold my entree order). Long after everyone but me received their appetizer I pleasantly asked a bus boy to inquire about my salad. It arrived 5 minutes later with no apology.  30 minutes after everyone received their entree but me I asked the bus boy to inquire about my entree. 15 minutes later I received mine, again with no apology. When the bill arrived not only were we charged twice for my entree, but there was no adjustment made for either of the two delays in my food.  I brought the issue to the waiter's attention and he reluctantly agreed to remove the duplicate entree as though he was doing me a favor. Insulted by his attitude I mentioned that he also made no attempt to adjust the bill for the unapologetic delay in serving my entire meal. He proceeded to blame me and the group for being disorganized in ordering everything at once, and I told him that as the waiter it was his responsibility to stay organized and that it was up to him whether to make he situation right or not. I have never experience a waiter blaming the customer for his own inability to juggle a group's order, and I worked in restaurants for nine years during high school and college.  15 minutes later he brought an adjusted bill (rightfully removing the duplicate charge and surprisingly removing my actual entree charge) but he continued to blame me for his disorganization as he handed me the bill. Why make the bill right but continue to insult and displace blame on the customer?...because a 20% gratuity charge was added, preventing us from making the point clear and protecting his personal compensation. Only the restaurant owner suffered.  As a side note, a few friends pointed out how odd it was that my wife was the first to receive every phase of her order first and that the waiter probably had a crush on her (which I dismissed as flattering but absurd). But in hind sight I have to wonder if being the only Caucasian in the Latino group (the waiter was also Latino) had something to do with it. I do not respect playing the race card, but I have to wonder.  I will never go back to this restaurant on principle alone and wish you the best of luck if you decide to give them a chance.",

We choose Darlington House as the prices were very reasonable as compared to other restaurants in the area, we were able to hold the event in a private space, and we were able to offer guests options to choose from (including Gluten Free pasta).  Pro\u2019s \u2022 Private Location - The upstairs space was a perfect location for our event in which we had a total of 41 guests (including ourselves) \u2022 Private Bar and Bathroom for the Upstairs Space \u2022 Using the 60\u2019 (5 FT) rounds we sat 8 to 9 guests at each of the 5 tables and still had plenty of room to wander during the cocktail hour. (Note: Darlington House recommended 10 guests per a 60\u2019 table but typically 72\u2019 rounds are used to seat 10 guests and 60\u2019 for 8 guests. ) \u2022 The centerpieces for our tables were made in house and were both beautiful and reasonably priced (approx. $40/table) \u2022 All in all the food was brought out timely and guests enjoyed the selection of fish and pasta (including GF pasta)  Con\u2019s  \u2022 Of all the vendors I worked with throughout our wedding, Darlington House was not the easiest nor friendliest but was manageable and responsive \u2022 If selecting Darlington House for an event such as a rehearsal I recommended selecting the price per hour for alcohol verse consumption as we ended up spending more than if we had done the all-inclusive rate which was recommended by the venue. \u2022 No Parking , however, Valet services are available for a fee \u2022 Limited selection of linens available if you have a particular theme/colors in mind \u2022 If you want to have place cards and other decorations, be sure to have someone get there early to set up as you will need to do that yourself!  Overall, we had a very positive experience and response from guests. I would recommend Darlington House to any other couples who are looking for a restaurant for their rehearsal dinner as we were very happy with our food and service during the event.",
