For drinks, we ordered cappuccino, mochaccino (not on the menu, but s/o to our server Angela who made it to perfection!) and oat latte; Food - mushroom and parmesan egg benny, fried egg sammie (best brioche I have had, so very soft!), poached pear (very distinct flavors) and black velvet pancakes for food. Everything was delish! Decent portion size. Prices are almost similar to other brunch places in town. Its a hidden gem, recommend trying out once.  Taking out one star because service was bit slow, it felt that they were understaffed. Went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. They don't take reservations but checking on Yelp for waiting time helps!",

Sure it's to be expected that the yolk would break on our sandwiches.. but we were not given any napkins nor were we given cutlery for our hash browns ... I even ordered the Korean potato's as my side but only received regular hash browns. The cherry on top of this underwhelming experience was the hair I found under the lid of my takeout iced mocha. Quite disappointed in our experience and hopefully in the future brekkie cares for their takeout customers as much as their dine in customers.",

The first thing that is worth noting is the the warm and welcoming atmosphere. The mimosa selection is pretty neat, and definitely stands out as compared to other diners, as having more than one flavour.  I don't remember exactly what we all ordered, but the food was absolutely exquisite. This is one of the very few remaining restaurants that still makes their Hollandaise every day, with no clumping, no film on the top, I would say this is the best Hollandaise I've ever had. The fingerling potatoes are a step in the right direction for most restaurants, but the seasoning on their spuds is perfect!  I believe I had ribs or some sort of braised meat with my meal, and it was absolutely delicious.  In short, if you're looking for a breakfast diner to fall in love with, make sure you stop in to let them show you what a caring and passionate kitchen team can do, to the Chef, don't stop what you're doing, do not fall into the cost trap of making things cheaper. Your wholesome ingredients are what makes the dining experience special, and know that your efforts don't go unnoticed. Bravo Brekkie team. Until next time!",

Fried chicken was well cooked but under seasoned. Chorizo was tasty and added much needed flavor, but was still on the plain side.

Usually we'd go to OEB or something but the service here was super friendly and the food was AMAZING.  We've had a lot of french toast, it's a hard dish to get wrong but also hard to get just perfect; we thought we found \"peak\" french toast at the River Cafe but man Brekkie gets this one so right. The toast is thick cut and a dream; crispy outside and soft inside. The sweet cream and syrup as well as whipped cream and fruits pair so well with it, this french toast is now our new favourite. The bacon here is thick cut and the perfect amount of crispy and soft, although my girlfriend prefers more crispy she was satisfied with this.  The Brekkie Toast/Avocado toast is delicious, although in my opinion the portion is a little small for what you\u2019re paying.  The Short Rib Poutine is hands down my favourite dish, sweet, savoury, delicious. The short rib is amazingly tender and it pairs so well with the sweet gravy and potatoes, love it.  Overall would highly recommend this place for breakfast or brunch, it was delicious!",

It was tasty while it lasted - which was not for very long. This was very disappointing, however, my mood changed for the worse once again when I saw that I was charged $2 for a teeny tiny bit of syrup (which I was NOT told was extra and the server made it sound like she was just offering it to go with my food). My brunch buddy was also very unimpressed by her mediocre eggs Benny and hash browns, and her $3.50 miniature glass of orange juice. Total, the bill came to $43, and I wasn't even half way to being full! Since I already felt so cheated, I only tipped $5 for our awful experience, which was met with a moody and forced \"thank you, sir\", but that's alright because it just solidified our plan to not return. I give two stars only because I like the the decor, and the overall atmosphere of the space, and because the one time I had visited before (many months before), it was a relatively decent experience. Something must have changed since then!",

Somone spending this much isnt a child. The standard if you give no selection is over easy or sunny side up. NOT SCRAMBLED SLOP. Inedible wast of my money, plus a empty \"latte\" that was essentially a couple drops of coffee and cold milk.  Over priced, fake, hipster garbage. If your going to charge high end prices? Do not send people scrambled slop. Toast? Does not go in a steaming box on top of your SCRAMBLED SLOP.  First time trying, local to the neighborhood and i will warn everyone away. What a waste of 40$ Would have been better off at Dennys. At least they let you pick your eggs. Not assume you are 5 years old.",

I've been here twice now, and I can see that they are a business WANTING to make improvements, which can't be said of all businesses. They learn from their experiences. To note, I visited Brekkie on the labor day long weekend and they struggled a bit with seating everyone. However, on my next visit, they had this all fixed. In fact, they were leveraging the NoWait app even better and trying to seat everyone in order (not actively giving priority to the app or those waiting) which is nice to see. Their food is also great. Recommend the bennie's. The ghost pepper sauce is HOT! Be careful, and they do warn you about that. Service was great, quick and personal. Overall, I would say visit Brekkie! Their cool, quaint location is really a great foundation for their business and I'm so glad to see that they are always actively trying to improve! Don't be afraid to give them feedback, they are truly receptive. Good luck to Brekkie! I'll see you again in the future for brunch!",

The decor was nice great service and food winning formula much better then the ace breakfast place that was in the spot prior.",

For the price, the portion is relatively small. BUT, they both taste amazing. The Moroccan chicken is a curry chicken and it compliments the holindaise sauce nicely. The potato feels out of place though. It felt like they didn't put any effort in making the potatoes special. The chicken and waffle is not your regular fried chicken. The chicken has a complex taste. The waffle is fluffy. I would say it's a pancake and waffle hybrid. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and attentive. We will be back for more.",

The menu is very different from most breakfast  places and that can play both ways. In our case it did not meet with our taste (to be  clear the food was obviously prepared well and the presentation was very good)  We went Sunday morning when you expect to pay more and get something different (special) for breakfast.  I had the crab and asparagus benny because I really like the taste of crab, between the taste of the hash browns used instead of the traditional muffin to serve the Benny and the hollandaise sauce I would be hard pressed to  say it was crab.  The hash brown as a base is a good idea but it can't overpower the main ingredients, and the hollandaise  suffered the same problem (for my taste). The service was OK but considering there were only five tables seated at that time it should have been better. Probably more of a problem was that at no time were we asked how was our food or our experience, a new venture it would seem would want feedback. Add to this a bill for $53.00 for a Benny and a order of French toast with two cups of coffee plus tip, and I  have a hard time recommending this a place I  would go to on a regular basis. I will give it a while and may give them another chance but at this time improvement is needed.  Ian McLaren",

Was thrilled to find these guys had filled the breakfast gap in my neighbourhood. Only 7 weeks old, I walked in not really sure what to expect. What I discovered was truly unique. If you cross-bred a vegan with a carnivore you\u2019d get Brekkie. The menu boasts healthy bowls and kombucha tea to breakfast dishes with sides of meaty goodness. I have the three eggs which came with fried pork belly, brisket and thick cut bacon. A halved tomato topped with a nice pesto sauce and herbed potatoes. My friend had the eggs sandwich with pork belly and pineapple salsa. The only downs I found was initial contact with staff to place an order was a little long but so friendly once they got past the rush that had just hit. The other were the potatoes which felt like they had been sitting in oil, they were so greasy I couldn\u2019t eat them. The rest of the dish was magic - meat sweats for days! For breakfast it\u2019s on the higher end of the price scale but you really get something different than everywhere else. Not the place for a classic brekkie that\u2019s for sure! The vibe and decor was fresh and open with high ceilings and bright colours. Will return for sure!",
