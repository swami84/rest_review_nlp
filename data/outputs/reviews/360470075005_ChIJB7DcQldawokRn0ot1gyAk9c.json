Cramer apparently can't even manage a taco stand well enough to produce consistently decent food.  Hey Cramer - did you know Mexican food is supposed to be a bit spicier than cardboard that has been sitting in a warehouse since the Great Depression?  A taste test between Bar San Miguel and my daughter's school lunch would probably result in most people thinking Bar San Miguel's food is made with leftovers - from last year.  The food I ordered was flavorless - as was that ordered by others I was with. I ordered something that had potatoes. I found the variance in the temperature of those potatoes to indicate they were microwaved - some were hot, some were cold. What garbage!  Like many places in Brooklyn, this place is not a bargain. But what sets this place apart, it seems, is that it is owned by a blow-hard hypocrite who cannot even manage a tiny business while he's blabbering on TV as if he's the world's greatest investment mind.  Next time you want Mexican food, skip this over-priced dump and get some street food that will likely taste better and cost 1/3 the price.  If you don't believe this review, check out Yelp. There are many horrible reviews. And many of the reviews that are hidden as \"not currently recommended\" are very interesting - and negative.",

If only the food were half as good as the pictures the restaurants posts on Yelp - but it's not.  The food didn't make me sick, but next time I hear Cramer promote his restaurant on Mad Money, I might throw up.  The quality control is garbage at Jim Cramer's Bar San Miguel, and there are obviously insufficient systems in place to monitor the quality.  I ordered the short rib tacos. 1) They were appetizer-size. 2) They had almost no meat. 3) They were virtually flavorless.  My friend ordered a chicken dish with mole sauce. What was that like? 1) The chicken was barely warm, 2) The mole sauce was flavorless, and cold, 3) The potatoes it came with ranged in temperature from hot to cold (gee, did they nuke it?).  Cramer - you need to stick to what you do best. This restaurant is an embarrassment.  If you want better food, go to a street vendor. At least there the owner actually knows what's going on, and cares.",

When my dad came to visit, my wife and I made sure we took him here with the hope that we would meet Cramer.  Unfortunately, Cramer was not \"working\" that night.  Even though Cramer wasn't there, we were very impressed with BSM.  Our server was very nice; he even gave us a couple free drinks because of a mistaken order at another table.  The Manhattan was amazing.  It is probably the best drink I've had in NYC.  The noise level was better than most places as it seems to be geared to a more sophisticated crowd.  BSM consists of a bar with stools and then tables.  This isn't a bar where you'll have a hundred people standing in a tight space.  I am excited to go back to BSM in the future.  Maybe Cramer will be there next time.  We can only hope.",
