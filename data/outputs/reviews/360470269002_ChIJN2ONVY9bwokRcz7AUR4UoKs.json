        "caption": "I am a Michigander, we toured Domino's Pizza as kids in elementary. I grew up on Domino's. I currently reside in Brooklyn and figured let's go to Domino's in which I live a 3 minute walking distance. Place an online order, after noticing on the tracking the bar wasn't moving about 10 minutes later I placed a call to confirm the order. The guy said 10 minutes\ud83d\udc4c! So I thought but I remind you the bar still hadn't changed until I called. The estimated pick was 8:28 - 8:38 pm. I get there approximately 8:40pm. The guy finally strolls over to the register I said hello, here for pick up. He says exactly \"yeah, whats the name?\" I said oh you don't say hello? He looked iritated, so I just gave him the name and then he asked my last four digits, I obliged, he fumbled I look up and the guy in the back three up 4 fingers, I assumed 4 minutes. He was so rude to the point where the child I was with said maybes he's tired. I explained to her thats no excuse if a customer comes into your store you greet them, and if someone says hello, you say hello back. Okay. 10 minutes later a lady in the back looks up front, and asked the guys in the back what are they still waiting on.  They shrugged, no sense of urgency or care in the world. She comes and asked what I ordered, my reply was huh? Ma'am I don't even remember at this point, and again she asked my four digits, in which I gave. 5 minutes later she comes out with my order. Silly me didn't bother to open the boxes to check, I assumed after all the time I waited it was going to be hot. Again I only live a 3 minute walk, literally two blocks behind the shop. Get home remove my outerwear, wash my hands, opened the box and had to put slices and wings in the oven. Oh by the way wings looked nothing like the pic online, it was literally salad dressing poured in top of the chicken, not tossed at all like it appears on the website. I called and the \"manager\" explained well of the customer isn't here for the time of pick up it goes in an oven to keep it warm. I explained to him I was there before the pizza was out of the oven, or before my order was \"ready\". He said well if you bring every thing back we\"ll make you a new one. Okay I just told you I had to put the food in the microwave, were you listening? His response was there's nothing we can do. Goodbye.   Domino's you all need to make sure your franchisees are in compliance with Domino's Pizza, personally I will never go there again, not in NYC I am very dissappointed and appalled by the \"managers\" response. The worst service, to the point I had to explain to a child. I hope she, at least learned a lesson in customer service, because clearly  your franchisee was never taught. He act like I didn't have a choice, I'm sure they'll be other customers and my little $30 was just $30. But never again. Oh I am also going to do a Google review.",

There is no diversity there and they don\u2019t care about the CUSTOMER. They took my money and I didn\u2019t get my food.  I love dominos I eat here (not this location) often and I was so disappointed with the customer service. The tracker said my food was on the way out for delivery at 10:27pm. I had to physically go up there and see what the hold up was with my food because the manager said \u201cthey turn off there phones all day because they don\u2019t wanna take any orders from the phone.\u201d  I put in the directions call me when here. I live 2 blocks away from the location. The delivery driver called me at 11:45 while I was on the phone with customer service (which didn\u2019t do really anything but file a complaint) One time. I called him back asked him to bring my food. He literally hung up in my face. That\u2019s when I walked to the location asked to speak to the manager and he was the rudest person I\u2019ve ever came across. So I actually called the cops. The cops told them to make me a new pizza. Totally didn\u2019t listen disregarded the police and me as the CUSTOMER I was there at the location til 1:45 waiting to be  SERVED. So I went home never got food or my refund.  I\u2019ve read the reviews and a lot of People are saying the same thing I\u2019m Saying and majority of the reviews are bad. I wouldn\u2019t even give them one star if I didn\u2019t have too and the majority of bad reviews are African American people. A customer should never have to call the cops to get food that they paid for PERIOD! I WILL NEVER EAT DOMINOS AGAIN! THROW THE WHOLE DOMINOS AWAY!",

Today I redeemed points for a free pizza and ordered a chicken Caesar salad and chicken Alfredo pasta. Delivery took forever, my Pizza was cold and I didn't receive my salad. I called (as I've done before) and was told the correct salad would be delivered in 10-15 minutes. I explained that my Pizza was cold and I'd never received a cold Pizza before. The guy said what do you want me to do? Well if you have to ask absolutely nothing but I won't be ordering from here anymore. One hour later and still no salad delivery. Ive had enough of poor delivery and poor customer service. Maybe carryout is better.",

He then showed up with a 2 liter soda, after 36 minutes of me waiting. As for the food, I ordered 2 pasta dishes and didn't get a full serving ( I order this dish all the time) and it was burnt. The bread, it looked decent but the cheese was stuck on the sides of the box which did not look very appetizing. Overall, I feel the customer service over at this store was the worst I've ever encountered and they handled my order very poorly. I wouldn't and will not recommend this store to anyone.",

As long as you order before 2am, they will still deliver\". So I ordered and the confirmation page came up with the dominos tracker on it. It said my pizza was being made. 1 minute later, the page refreshed and it said, \"Mmm, it's there! We hope your enjoying your meal\". I didn't think anything of it. I thought maybe they're expediting the process of tracking so they can start shutting down for closing, but still make my pizza. An hour went by and no pizza arrived. I began to call and no answer. I won't be getting my pizza tonight. and the fact that the tracker says they already delivered it means I won't get it when they open either. My guess is someone wanted to get out so fast that they just clicked my order away smh. And I'm at work extremely hungry too. Talk about a horrible experience.",

Heaven forbid they would indulge me with a bit of customer service as their little window sign indicates... worse pizza place, refuse to wait 2 gracious minutes...  they took my money, did not deliver pizza  - they are thieves until I see my refund...I know these stores are franchises but I am going to write to the founder and let him know that what he is advertising and standing behind is a farce...at least where this place is concerned...@Fulton street, bklyn, ny...shame, no way to run a business...karma my freinds if the big equalizer...",
