Excellent. Sat out on the patio (as its the only thing open due to Covid) and it was nice. The food is very fresh and flavorful and the portions are big. They have daily specials which are nice.

Hawaiian Hideout offers a variety of drinks and delicious Asian fusion food options, all at a very reasonable price. The drinks are generally between $8-10 and the dishes are generally $10-15. We found our drinks to be STRONG and refreshing, and our pad see ewe and panang curry to be delicious. The food portions seemed a bit small, but honestly with the prices of the drinks, we didn't feel too bad about it. There's also a vegan section of the menu and lots of options for people with dietary restrictions, which I was impressed by.  In addition to food, service was friendly and reasonable. But the most impressive part of the restaurant has got to be the beautiful, authentic decor that transports you to the beach in Hawaii. Can't wait to bring our friends back here!",

All of these were enjoyable( I recommend tthe lumpias, even though they were just an entree, they tasted great), the one thing I couldn\u2019t eat was the ramen that I ordered, the ramen was HUGE, so maybe if I haven\u2019t ordered the other things I could\u2019ve eaten half of the ramen...  Ambient: the decoration is mostly Hawaiian and the music is Hawaiian too, there are some Japanese type art objects around the place too.  Location: I walked from cloud gate to the restaurant, the neighborhood was safe, the restaurant was easy to get to.  Service: they have a good costumer service, very patient too.

We have been ordering delivery regularly since the pandemic and the food comes well packaged and quick (We order directly from the AO not through a delivery app). As a vegetarian, I love how many options I have (they have an entire Vegan/GF menu but will also modify non Vegan meals if you want).  Their Panang is probably some of the best I've had, and we had it in Thailand! If you eat at the restaurant you must get the Panang sweet potato fries. Seriously the most delicious bite ever! I usually get the panang with veggies and tofu for take out because it's saves better.  Their Vegan Lumpia's are so tasty, we get two orders because we'll fight over them if we don't! They also have a good selection of veggie sushi, my husband (non veggie) loves their Sunomono roll and says they do a really nice job on Nigiri as well.  The in person dining was always fun, but with the exception of a couple patio meals, we haven't been able to experience it this year.  Overall, well developed flavors, nice portions, great service, why wouldn't you support this local gem??? Thank you AO for being a staple in our neighborhood.",

It was noodles in soup, alright, but tasted nothing like ramen. The soup was light, not at all like the tonkatsu it\u2019s advertised to be. Noodles were somewhat hard and bland, and overall was just a very mediocre dish that doesn\u2019t taste like ramen at all. After that ramen experience I thought, \u201cpho is pretty simple, surely they can\u2019t screw that up too, right?\u201d I just had pho here and it was NOT pho. The broth is dark, not like clear broths I\u2019ve had at other pho places. The beef pieces were different as well,  not the steak and flank I was expecting. It was beef, but an unusual cut. The broth was way too spicy because the jalape\u00f1os were already in the soup, instead of being set aside on another plate like other places usually do. I mean, this certainly LOOK like an Asian restaurant, but it just strikes me as a place that\u2019s forgotten how to be Asian. If you\u2019re looking for a more \u201cauthentic\u201d or traditional experience, avoid this spot. I was hungry and made the same mistake twice, but I won\u2019t again.",

DID a Google search chinese restaurants in the south loop.  This place appeared.  I checked the menu and although there were sushi dishes etc.  I found what I thought would be good. Chicken teriyaki bourbon.  Wellllll, it was passable at best.  Some diced vegetables a sweet sauce and I paid extra for chicken.  It was nothing special especially for 13.00.  Now the workers were very very nice and it's a fun place. Tiki huts and all that.  If you're looking for something say more exotic or drinks.  I didn't imbibe but they have an extensive drink menu, sushi, poke bowls none of which I like than this place is for you.  To each its own at least try it once.  It may work for you.",

Once upon a time we loved their chicken, not sure if the chef changed or was out, but this last time it was dry and they forgot to send out with it's special sauce; the nasi, though tasty, was heavy on the rice (almost like a bi bim bop, just cheaper veggies); and the lettuce wraps, again tasty, but so much sauce (growing up a friend's mom used to make these with the sauce as a dip, so I might be a little biased here).  As for the drinks my wife's knocked her on her butt after 4 sips (colada) but she says it tasted good, mine the Dr was way too syrupy (my guess the dash of caracao turned into finger or more) almost like cough medicine (or my early drinking years), they were however very quick to take that and bring me a beer (my suggestion to use less caracao was met with the suggestion the bartender may still make very similar, fair).  To be fair, I only ever liked their chicken so I came in not expecting much, and got less than that.  My overall would be a pass, but their menu is large enough, that by the law of averages there has to be better options, I just have not found them yet.",

        "caption": "Went there with a groupon, and had one of those rare \"I would actually pay full price for this\" moments.  I sampled a lot of the menu. It's mostly small plates meant to be shared, but the entrees are reasonably sized and could feed one not-so-hungry person. The menu is truly Asian fusion, but there is something for everyone to like - BBQ pork belly to sushi. The food was very well prepared and very tasty.  Further, they have outdoor seating and some daily drink specials (I went on Wed. for 1/2 price Sapporos) which, combined with small plates and lots of finger food, makes this a great place to get snacks and drinks in the summer.  The service was also very good, but they weren't particularly busy so that's kind of to be expected.  All-in-all, the experience is very fairly priced. I won't wait around for another groupon before going back.",

        "caption": "After reading some great reviews about Asian Outpost, I decided to check it out and see what the hype was all about. Everyone was raving about their fried chicken, so I decided to give it a try. Amazing. Seriously juicy fried chicken.  Apparently they put it in a pressure fryer to keep it so juicy. The chicken comes with a sweet & tangy Asian-flavored sauce that takes the flavor to another level. The fried rice and the soup that I had were good, but not as good as the chicken - that is definitely their signature dish.  The service was really good, and the ambiance was interesting. I felt like I was in a quirky antique furniture store and there were all kinds of things to look at on the walls and ceiling. I would suggest Asian Outpost for a casual, neighborhood dinner with friends. Support the South Loop and check it out!",
