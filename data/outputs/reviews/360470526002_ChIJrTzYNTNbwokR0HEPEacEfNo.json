The broccoli had nothing on it at all, the steak had pepper but needed salt. The mashed potatoes needed butter but it was flavored at least. The size of the steak for the price 36 dollars exceeded my expectations but the amount of broccoli they give you for 7 dollars is laughable. However this is a more upscale steakhouse so I guess I understand. The good reviews are what led me to order from here and the food is decent. It probably would\u2019ve been better if I ate inside instead of taking out. I had to call in to order because their ordering site was down and it being my first time I asked the hostess how did they cook their steaks looking for if it was made with garlic butter or a different method and the hostess said she didn\u2019t know. Not to bring her down but in customer service \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d isn\u2019t something you should ever say, even if you don\u2019t know the answer go and ask someone. Other than that I would order from here again but I would dine in to get better service and food.",

The guy took the steak back to the kitchen after we told him it was burnt, he came back and said he tried it and it never tasted burnt to him so he\u2019ll still have to charge us. Mind you, we had only the one bite. Horrible service. The Atmosphere was good but that encounter was just horrible.

The placed was over booked, people sitting less than 6 ft apart, waiters not wearing masks except 1 individual and they were interacting with customers some of whom were elderly. When asked why they were not wearing a mask, one waiter said it was uncomfortable, and that it didn't matter since it was a full house anyways and also recommends customers stay home instead of coming out to eat if they had problem with how things were done in the restaurant. These are the reason why our #numbers are going up. I have been to other restaurants and they respect the current public health policy in place but not this establishment.",

This may seem simple but the garlic butter served with the dinner rolls is scrumptious (like melt a portion on my food scrumptious). The crab cake is made from lump crab, with zero breading and it doesn't have the mayo like taste I have found in other crab cakes. I had the Chilean Sea Bass, creamed spinach and mushroomsn he had the Rib Eye, French fries.  The fries were done to order but I found salty. The cook on the rub was near perfect but the flavor profile was near perfect. My dish came with a side of mashed potatoes which I did not like due to personal preferences.  Drinks Pineapple mojito: Excellent, the drink was not too boozy and the pineapple flavor came through with freshness. This drink was not too sweet nor was the sugar left grainy. Side car: I have never had one before, but this drink was also delicious. Not boozy or too sweet.",

I can say without reservation that this was one of the best dining experiences I've had. First off, the decor is really lovely - they took time to integrate Christmas decorations into their usual design. Second, the service is top-notch - not only did they remember my companions and me, but they ensured that my visually impaired friend was safe navigating the restaurant. Our waiter, whose name I'm afraid I don't remember exactly but who delivered great service last time I was here, was very knowledgeable about the food and didn't hesitate to answer questions, and was friendly without being overbearing. My cocktail was very nicely mixed. Appetizers were fabulous - perfectly executed calamari, escargot only surpassed by Balthazar's and other top-line French restaurants, and a gorgeous fried Camembert that was sweet, salty, umami, and had a fantastic oozing texture. The mains were simple and perfectly executed - the branzino got rave reviews, the New York Strip was meaty and flavorful, and my skirt steak was cooked to a perfect juicy medium rare with the perfect amount of char. For dessert, we had a mixed berry cake that is tart and sweet, and a mango mousse that was rich and yet light at the same time, accompanied by some lovely teas.  I wish I'd taken pictures, but I was just kind of caught up in the warm and cozy atmosphere and great food. Prices are a bit high for my personal budget, but every dollar is represented in the budget. I'm really grateful to the staff for making my birthday a night to remember, and when I can, I'll be back.",

I ordered the Prime rib and asked for an end cut , if available . Instead they brought out the steak sliced for A  3 year old . Cut into Little pieces .Waiter claims the kitchen didn't understand my request. Never In my life , Have I heard of A steakhouse not knowing what an end cut is ! Then had to send it back again because it was raw in the center. Mind you there was a 15 min wait during the meal. My wife was done eating and I still had nothing. Manager no where to be seen. They took off 10 % for messing up the steak two times. A whopping $5.80 . To add insult to injury , we ordered dessert to go. Here is a picture of what we received for $15.00.",

Starting from the outside in , the restaurant is designed to be subtle but sophisticated on the outside. Upon entering the first corridor of  the restaurant you find all of the restrooms . I found this design interesting but convenient because the rest rooms were available to customers as soon as they entered .  Also , the rest rooms are separated from the dinning room so that customers aren\u2019t interrupted by flushing sounds or worse while they are eating .  After walking past the restroom there is another door that leads to the bar area where we were received  by our waiter Paul . Paul was the best waiter I have ever had hands down . He was attentive and accommodating. He constantly checked on my date and I to make sure we were enjoying our dinner . He gets five stars on his own for being amazing at his job.  Now let\u2019s talk about the food. My date and I ordered two Caesar Salads that were super fresh, two surf and turfs which consisted of Fresh lobster tail which was scrumptious , filet mignon, pita bread and a side of salads . We also ordered the crab cake appetizer which was also delicious and a large enough proportion for two people to share. We were also served bread rolls with fresh garlic butter . My date ordered a fountain drink which came to our table in a lovely glass bottle. I ordered white wine moscato which was absolutely delicious as well.  Lastly we ordered a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e because my date and I were celebrating our anniversary and Paul brought it out to us with a lit candle on top, which I thought was so thoughtful of him to do. As expected the dessert was just as amazing as the food .  All of the food that we ordered was delicious with no flavor overpowering the other . The service that I received along with the amazing food left me and my date happy to pay the bill which was actually quite expensive. All in all I would return to this restaurant again . The food , service and ambiance combined together sets a Romantic mood perfect for couples searching for a great place to dine .",

The drinks were great. No complaints there. We got mushroom appetizer which was delicious. For the main dish my husband was going to order a ribeye steak. The menu options were a 24oz or cut to order per pound. Which of course they said they don't offer anymore only 24oz. Ok. We order 24oz. The steak was absolutely amazing but nowhere near 24oz. Maybe a pound or just a bit over. For $48.00 no vegetable or side dish comes with it. I had fish which was good and came with everything. The place is very nice. The service is good.

The waiter was very nice, attentive, polite, and didn't annoy us with too much checking in. Boyfriend had the medallion steak that was OMG, divine (for a steak, considering I prefer seafood and tofu over red meat). I chose a filet mignon which was good but was even better with a little more seasoning. Also had the Ros\u00e9 and boyfriend had the Malbec. This was such a fantastic last-minute find! If I'm ever in the area and craving steak, I'll definitely get the medallion for myself.",
