It had very little meat and even fewer veggies. There were only a few sprigs of cilantro, 3 slices of jalapeno, no radish, 2 thin slices of pickled veg, and 2 thin slices of peppers.  It did however have a ton of onions, which wasn't even listed as a topping to the sandwich. The shrimp spring roll was so tiny and flavorless. The peanut sauce that accompanied the spring roll was absolutely delicious. The little bit of duck meat that was on the sandwich was pretty tasty as well, just wish there was more of it on the sandwich. My high hope of a filling and appetizing lunch were not fulfilled\ud83d\ude16",

However, the food has changed significantly since our last visit.  Each of our party of five receieved appetizers and entrees that resembled mediocre Chinese food.  The spring rolls looked and tasted stale with unrecognizable chicken bits  inside. The egg rolls tasted as if recently defrosted.  Neither appetizer had the fresh and healthy taste or subtle flavors I associate with Vietnamese food.  This same issue was even more apparent with the entrees.  The beef and chicken in two of the entrees was thick and oddly chewy rather than thin and light.  The dishes were in heavier sauces that I associate with Chinese food.  I am aware that because of its history Vietnamese food is a fusion of French and Chinese cooking; however that blend was not evident in our entrees.  In regard to the service,  Mr. Nguyen the owner still greets you, and seems in charge but the dining room staff and  kitchen service needs much training.  Two orders were mixed up resulting in food being delivered that we did not order.   I hope the restuarant is able to return to its roots.  d",

He single-highhandedly runs his business and do everything for his employees and his customers. He never takes a day off and yet, when you see him, he will always greet you with a smile and open arms.  Since my last review in 2013, I've since ordered delivery a couple of times (great way to surprise the hubby at work) and catering for my mother's 60th surprise birthday party which had about 30 people. I was able to talk to Uncle Tuan on the phone, we texted and customized the menu which had over 6 choices and he arranged for delivery pick-up to meet me half way since I lived outside of his delivery zone. He was always willing to work with me and kept me up to-do-date on all the details so I knew when the food was being made, being delivered and prep instructions. The food came freshly made, flavored right and the portions were more than enough. His catering food was the star of my Mother's party and many people asked where did I catered from. I had gotten the Banh Cuon (Vietnamese rice crepes), Lemon Grass Chicken, Grilled Beef Short Ribs, Simply It Special Noodles and Fried Rice, and Beef Skewers to just name a few and everyone really enjoyed it.  I really wish that this restaurant was in my local neighborhood because it would be a place that I frequent often. Sadly, I write this review to ask for your support from fellow Yelp community and friends who shares my love for food and ethnic cuisines. While business has been good on the delivery side, I've learned that dine-in rate has slowed down due to the location and competition. The restaurant could be facing some tough decisions in the near future so I wanted to be transparent and urge you to come and check it out. Please tell your friends and to try the food and see the unbelievable level of customer service for yourself. There is always a Yelp check-in deal and always a promotion.  This is a one-of-a-kind family owned business and Uncle Tuan is really an uncle to all visitors. Please come and help support his business and check out his food and flavors. He is always opened arms and all ears for feedback and suggestions on how to make the food and service better. He truly cares about his customers, his food, his brand and his work. I'm not related to him at all and this review is from my perspective as a long-time patron who really values his business in the Chicago community.",

I don't really understand why so many people are praising their pho as it doesn't really taste that great. The meat in the pho was pretty dry as well and the broth was not the best so I poured a lot of sriracha inside.  The glasses were a bit dirty so I used the water to clean my utensils. The rest of the place was clean though and the place was relatively cozy. On the contrary, the service was very nice. The waitress ,Tiana, was pretty nice.",

I had a really odd experience with the waitress. I ordered Pho with no tofu however when I received my food there was tofu. I put the tofu to the side and proceeded to eat. The waitress came over and said \"no tofu right\", I said \"right but it's fine\", she replies \"oh you should just try it\", I reply \"I don't like the way tofu taste\".  I had Pho for the first time a few weeks ago and was super excited when I need to take a break from driving lyft and this place was so close to my location. I saw the ratings and was elated. How lucky am I, I thought to myself.  My food came and I took a sip of the broth and immediately wondered why I didn't actually read the reviews instead of just looking at the ratings. I had to add an insane amount of siracha just to get some flavor. I do wish the meal was more eventful. Maybe the other dishes are tasty I'm not sure, again I only had the Veggie Pho.  Overall I would not recommend this place if you like your food with a lot of flavor otherwise have at it.",

I have to say that I am a fan of Pho Xe Tank myself, but Simply it is closer to me, and may become my new default place. I had a groupon when I came here and they said I could get the lunch specials and appetizers. The special comes with soup and salad and fresh fruits for dessert (great touch!) and it gets really filling. I had to take most of the food from the entr\u00e9e home.  I had the lemongrass beef appetizer- so fun, cos you get to make the dumpling yourself, with the rice paper and the veggies. All the veggies were super fresh and the beef had an interesting spice on it but strangely, it comes cold. I wasn't sure about that part being right.  We had the beef mango- very interesting mix of flavours and the mango was delish. We also had the ginger chicken, which is just a basic chicken dish, nothing different or fancy, but well made.  The place itself is simple, clean and airy, with some unique touches- I personally liked the lanterns on the lights. Come here for a quick lunch, they have specials and deals for business lunches as well.",

When we came here at 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning, we were the very first customers that day. He came out, sat next to us, and told us his endless stories. We ordered Spring Rolls, Chicken with Sticky Rice, and Beef Pho. The Spring Rolls were really fresh and delicious. The Chicken with Sticky Rice was close to its original version in Vietnam. The Pho that I had was a little strange, though. The broth was flavorful, the onion was cooked just right, and the beef was luscious. However, there was no green onion, an irreplaceable ingredient in any bowl of Pho, at all. Quite strange. The side dish vegetable also came in a generous amount. Overall, the Pho here was as good as it gets.",

And like all good restaurants, a cold glass of filtered ice water is also complimentary.  As far as taste. It was good, but! There's a but. It had a taste of sugar that I'm not accustomed to. The flavor is there but not too overwhelming. And needed a little more 5 spice or star anise or whatever gives it that extra kick. Asked not to put tripe in soup. Don't know if they do but rather safe than sorry.  But, I will be back from time to time as it's ranks high overall.  The portion was humongous. Think it was a quart bowl filled to the top.  All menu items reasonably priced. Just expect to pay $2 per hour for parking. $9.95 for Pho soup plus tax, totaling $11.09. A tip and your looking at $15 for lunch plus parking.

It was very sweet, I wouldn't have that one probably again. My friends ordered beef noodles soup. It was delicious they said. However the quantity is very filling. I couldn't finish the pork pieces. The whole experience was nice. One last thing, if its possible check in on yelp right while you are there, you will receive a free lemonade. I checked in on yelp and got one. The waitress so friendly, as a token she gave all of us free lemonades. Now as a token I am giving them a 5 star.",

The taro bubble tea was blended well, but also very bland -- it should taste like a box full of vanilla wafers, but this tasted like a wafer was waived over it.  It was $20 (incl. tax and tip) not well-spent.  Based on other reviews, maybe I just picked the only two mediocre dishes, or maybe the 'B' cook was on duty Saturday night, but I thought Vietnamese cooking was full of pungent herbs and spices, with sweet and heat and tang and crisp and crunch and chew.  This came up very very short.",

The seating part is bigger and the Windows aren't blocked; eating in might be the way to go here. The menu is big, and the prices are good, especially with a lunch special or banh mi combination. The lemonade tastes like countrytime, i.e., not like real lemon and overly sweet. The staff is friendly and helpful. The lemongrass chicken sandwich was not thrilling--lots of veggies, I'd forgotten it would be lathered up with mayo on both sides of the roll so I didn't ask them to hold it (it's not on the menu, guess I should just always expect it), and the chicken was low quality little chunks and not plentiful. The \"soup of the day\" is clear broth with chicken, EVERY DAY, so don't bother asking expecting something new and different, and don't even bother asking what it is. The chicken in the soup tastes and feels spongy, more like processed chicken product, and I threw the soup out after about two bites, so that wasn't really a plus-side to the meal. They serve blended boba drinks, which is good to know, because I've experienced a dearth of boba options in Chicago. A pretty big smoothie was $3.25 or so, which seemed very fair.  I'd go back, but would try to eat there rather than take out, and I'd avoid the sandwiches and probably try a noodle dish, and skip the lemonade.",

The service is always excellent & their delivery is super quick as well. They're also BYOB, which means the weekends get a bit rowdy.  What to order: Chicken (Pho Ga) or Beef (Pho Bo), Lemongrass Beef Rolls, Go Gai (spicy chicken salad - cold) & Tofu Sate (Dau Hu Xao Sate)  Tip: Order delivery if you're in the mood for chicken soup at home - they deliver it with all of the ingredients separated & you get to doctor it up however you like (just like in the restaurant). Also, the \"Lemonade\" is really \"Limeade\" but still good!",
