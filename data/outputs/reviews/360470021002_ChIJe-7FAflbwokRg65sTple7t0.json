The food is cooked fast, clean, well presented, not expensive and above all fabulously tasty. Take away, of course, take down to the river and enjoy the views seated by the river under Manhattan Bridge overlooking Brooklyn Bridge and Freedom Tower. One of the best kept secret locations in New York. I travel a lot around America and this place gave me the Wow of Thai authenticity, taste and the speedy service. How they manage on such small confined wagon I don't know, but will come back. Recommended",
