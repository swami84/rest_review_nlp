I looked online at the menu and to my surprise everything on the menu is not what\u2019s available at the restaurant! On top of that the food is tasteless! Do yourself a favor, take a selfy in front of the restaurant if you\u2019re looking for social media likes and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!",

I came to Hawaii last year and ate here every day food was great was so excited to come back this year stay at Aston hotel and eat at the long awaited wolf gang puck boy was I surprised. They didn\u2019t have any of the favorites even though it\u2019s on the menu they don\u2019t have it. The stuff they do have they show pictures of this yummy food yet serve something completely Different. Such as the turkey club sandwich it shows a nice big delicious Cabala type bread.  Yet you get your sandwich in it served on flat disgusting Ryebread .  Order the spaghetti and meatballs the noodles are overcooked the spaghetti sauce is Prego at best three meatballs they charge you $14 and then say they don\u2019t serve it with bread they served it with bread two days ago when somebody else got it but they no longer two days later serve it with bread order a side salad that states four dollars on their menu and they charge six dollars for one cup of plain lettuce six dollars.  The woman at the counter stated that they\u2019re switching all of their menu items around and changing their name so apparently this means the quality and quantity of food has lowered yet the prices have raised .   I made the mistake of trying to eat here a couple of different times since it is convenient to my motel and it was a huge mistake do yourself a favor eat somewhere else heck you\u2019re better off at the Burger King down the street in this place .   I don\u2019t know why when you have a good product and a good business you have to go and change everything to lower the quality what a huge disappointment.  The food here is no longer even worth the plastic it served in.  By the way when we complained about how horrible the food was and the price of the  ridiculous cup of lettuce  The manager said there was nothing she can do about the order  we were offered 25% off the next time we came in well let me assure you there will not be a next time !",

We explained how dry it was and said we didn't even want it anymore after the lack of costumer service. She began to refuse because we didn't have a receipt, yet we ordered from her only 10-15 minutes prior. She didn't provide us with a receipt and we noticed it was on the ground by her foot.",

Telling me to get my fat ass going, calling me b@#$ one insult  after another. This woman could barely stand up and reaked of alcohol. The gentleman before me told the cashier about the woman . The male cashier didn't do anything. All he could say is okay and didn't do anything. He didn't make the effort  getting the manager  or anyone. I placed my order and received a number and waited for my order . I purposely went away from the woman but she walked up to me and continues to harass me. I then told a female waitress about the woman.  The waitress  did nothing to remove the woman.. It's sad that Wolfgang puck restaurant have workers  that are to afraid to do anything about complaints. So worried they are going to get in trouble or fired. This woman should have been removed. I had one  patron sticking up for me and told her to leave. I shouldn't have to put up with this harassment. It was embarrassing. But it was disappointing that your employees didn't do anything.

Their breakfast is not only the best ever, it's reasonably priced. The morning after a arrived here in Waikiki, we had breakfast upstairs at the Tiki Bar, it was horrible and way over priced. The next morning, we decided to try Wolf Gangs, my, what a beautiful experience. We were treated like celebrities, we were served great, hot, delicious eggs, sausage and coffee, toast and wonderful potatoes! We didn't go any where else for our breakfasts for the remainder of our 6 day stay! We even are lunch and dinner there more often than not. The general manager, Scott was so good to us and the assistant manager, Anthony was the best person you could ever meet! He's the best guy we met on our trip! He has us for friends forever! I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family! And now, Anthony is family! Maholo, Anthony! I'd give this place a ten star rating, if I could!",

While I was waiting for my meal, I saw the guy making the pizza eating and drinking while making the pizzas, the girl distributing the completed orders dropped fries on the counter, picked them up, and it put back on the plate, and there was a lady in the back preparing food with gloves on but eating as she was making the food. I received my pizza and walked back to my hotel only to find out I was given the wrong pizza but didn't want to walk 15 min back to wait again for the correct meal. Not to mention the food is very average and a bit pricey considering it is basically a mall food court. Will not go back.",
