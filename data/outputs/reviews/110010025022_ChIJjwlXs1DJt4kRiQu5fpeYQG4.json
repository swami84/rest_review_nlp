A smear would\u2019ve been nice) and no aioli in the bag. My sweet potato fries was instead replaced with their regular fries (I loved their sweet potato fries so I was highly irritated to see regular fries instead). The food was Luke warm and subpar at best. After this experience I may consider not ordering from here for a while.",

I noticed the mushrooms seemed to have come out of a can, instead of chopped and grilled. This was the only ingredient that had this issue. The grilled jalapenos, onions, etc all appeared fresh! Hell, they even used spinach instead of iceberg lettuce - a major plus! 2. Runny eggs. I ordered an egg on my burger and it was over hard instead of easy. I do love a runny egg on my burger!  I would definitely eat here again. The eclectic variety of meats is cool AND they have impossible patties.",
