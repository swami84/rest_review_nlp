        "caption": "Updated APR2018  Very authentic Taiwanese restaurant. It is a small shop located on the side of the river in the plaza. The restaurant might look old and a little dirty but foods are amazing. Limited seatings so you might share a table with someone if you go alone.  The noodles was on point. Broth was tasteful and beef was nicely marinated. They have a home made hot sauce on the table that is spicy and aromatic. Only one scoop of that will be sufficient to add spiciness to your food. Their smoked duck and chicken are tasteful. The price is very reasonable. Portion is fair too compared with the price. They serve breakfast but only to a certain time.  The lady that helped us had a very nice attitude. You can pour your own water next to the door but she helped us anyway.  One hour of parking can be validated if you park in the plaza.",
