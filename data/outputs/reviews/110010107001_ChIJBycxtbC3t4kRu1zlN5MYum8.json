I was further taken aback with the dress code requirement of a jacket. They had lots and I complied but thereafter I had the strongest feeling that I was an unwanted second-class customer. I was placed back-into the-restaurant window table and had the great difficulty in getting any service. Now I arrived at 5:30 pm and waited for dinner to begin at 6 pm so the place had almost no one in it aside from me and a very ancient but honoured veteran. The steak was fine and the dessert excellent. the wine was expensive but good. Even as I left the place wasn't quite rocking. I left to be swamped in a torrential rain so the evening was a bit of a bust. Given their dress code I would suggest not walking to the place during the summer.",

However, we were very disappointed last night during restaurant week both by the quality of the food and the lack of the ma\u00eetre d\u2019s interest in our experience. A prime rib end-cut should be crispy or crusty on the outside, firm and succulent with flavor inside (generally end-cuts have a higher seasoning level).  Ours was flabby and had no flavor. Even the \u201cfresh\u201d horseradish was limp as was the house salad (no longer the flavorful Caesar salad). Because we strongly felt the quality was so out of step with this restaurant, we asked the waiter to mention it to the chef.  She said she would. Later she returned to our table and asked if the ma\u00eetre d had come to speak to us.  We replied he had not.  She said he probably is too busy.  However, we witnessed that he was not busy.   The lack of interest in talking with us was a second huge disappointment that should never happen in a restaurant of The Prime Rib\u2019s former stature. Perhaps the problem with quality of the end-cut was that the restaurant uses a different cut of meat for restaurant week than on its standard menu.  At least this is what we were told when we initially ordered the end-cut.  The waiter saying she was not sure an end-cut would be available since the cut of meat for restaurant week is different from the standard meat on the menu!!! Unfortunately, we will not return to the Prime Rib and risk another disappointment.  Eleanor",

The new was the Prime Rib , the restaurant itself was very upscale with a very kind valet and the decor was explicit, it was very classy yet cozy.  Until our waitress Ann came through and ruined my dining experience. Ann was curt with me several times to the point where she was down right rude, she did not want you to ask for anything until she offered it to you and when she did, you had to make sure you say the right words or she would have a rude come back and this happened several times, she cut my words off like basically she wanted me to just sit there and let her dictate to me how things were going to be on her time and my dime. From the menu taking before I could place my order so I had to share my daughters menu when she came back from the ladies room, to my being ridiculed for asking what sauces did they haves and even when I asked for a sprite when at that particular time she  was just serving water.  I thought at first I was just being paranoid, but after being talked to in a condescending way at least three times, it was evident either Ann was just having a busy bad night or she did not like serving myself and my daughter and at almost seven on Thanksgiving, they were not that busy. Whatever the case may be for the $167.00 dollars I paid for our meal,  and that tip I left her that she did not deserve, I expected common courtesy and respect. We ordered prime rib which is clearly their specialty and it was delicious, but I will never pay that much money to go out to eat and get treated that way again. That is why I swear by Ruth Chris , it is delicious the waiters are on point and the decor is beautiful. I had one not so pleasing experience, but not the blatant rudeness that I had gone through with Ann on Thanksgiving Day. My suggestion, although after my experience, I will not be back, but if you go and Ann is your waitress ask for another one or let her tell you what you can have and in what order and maybe your experience will be better than ours. I am very disappointed, should have stayed at my Aunties.",

What did he say? \u201cI would get in trouble if I played that.\u201d ???? Another item that needs addressing is their prices for drinks. Who charges $88 for a double or scotch?  I asked for a pour of glenmorangie signet which is a medium tier shelf scotch at Best but they clearly wanted to charge $44 per dram or scotch, either that or tack on extra for gratuity. Either way, folks that are knowledgeable about whiskey and business will take note. Also - make sure you pay attention to your minority clientele.  You just never know who walks in the door.",

First off, it's overly pretentious in that they FORCE men to wear a blazer, and you are not allowed to take it off at any point during the meal. There ARE loaners if you happen to not bring one, but the sheer fact that you HAVE to wear a blazer is absurd. The ambiance was actually quite good and had pretty terrific live music playing, but ordering was insanely confusing. We sat down with no menus present at all and then the server asked us if we wanted anything to drink but there was no drink menus provided. Once our food arrived, the filet mignon I ordered was slightly above average. I'm talking it might as well have come from Claim Jumper average. I've certainly had better steaks elsewhere so ultimately the food was not worth the cost in the end. This place should not have the prestige that it inexplicably does.",

There are numerous steakhouses in DC Ocean Prime, Del Frisco, Joes, Morton, Ruth & the list goes on; so when I spend good money at a restaurant I expect more then just good food. To began I requested a robust wine I was brought a sample glass which I enjoyed and requested the bottle, at that time the waiter insisted the price was $$$ numerous time. I was quite irritated & a tad bit offended since I hadn't ask for the price in the first place, but to move on the appetizers were great lobster bisque, oyster, shrimp cocktail as well as the crab cake no complaints. On to the entr\u00e9e experience I requested medium well filet mignon; the waiter informed me that the chef normally butterflies the steak which I informed him that I would like to keep my steak in tack. After orders were placed my husband jokingly commented on me not ordering my steak Oscar style which I always do, I realize that the waiter hadn't even giving us a topping selection so I politely asked if they could make my steak Oscar style which he said was no problem; he had just forgot to mention that they offered topping for the steaks. My husband ordered well done which came out prefect & my medium well came out well done also. I informed the waiter & at that time he decided to go back and forth with me on what the restaurant considers well done; he then went on to explaining that's why its better to get the steak butterflied. I sent the steak back and proceeded to ask for a manager; the manager then apologized & went on to say that we would not have to pay for the steak that we sent back. I explained to the manager that if you are charging 80$ for a steak I would advise you get a chef that is capable of making a steak to order, and thanked him for not charging me for the steak I sent back (sarcastic) & asked for the check.... WOULD NEVER GO BACK to many other great options out there FAVORITE Ocean Prime",

Named as one of the top five romantic restaurants in the U.S. by Food and Wine Magazine, the #1 Zagat rated steakhouse in D.C., and an IFMA Silver Plate winner, the Prime Rib is an old-world, \"civilized steakhouse.\"  My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. Men are required to wear jackets throughout dinner. Ties are optional. If you forget your dinner jacket, the restaurant has some for you to borrow. This is a very elegant and ritzy restaurant. Dress to impress! Everything inside the restaurant has old-school charm, a very art-deco vibe with tuxedoed waitstaff, black walls with gold trimmings, and live piano and bass music that doesn't drown out your conversations like so many modern restaurants.  We both ordered their signature cut of prime rib (with fresh grated horseradish on the side), the Buzz's salad (romaine, avocado, tomato, egg with white balsamic vinaigrette, extra virgin olive oil, and pecorino romano), and shared sides of grilled artichoke hearts, creamed spinach, and green beans. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and it was so flavorful. I usually prefer filet mignon, but this prime rib was amazing. The Buzz's salad was just okay, but the prime rib was fantastic. The creamed spinach and grilled artichoke hearts were both good; I'd recommend ordering those over the green beans.  Service was impeccable, of course. I loved the live piano and bass music; typically, I prefer classical and jazzy over loud pop/hip-hop/rap where you can't hear what your partner is saying. The servers are all on point.  Also, complimentary valet!",

He thoroughly enjoyed his prime rib and I my filet! Enjoyed a wonderful gimlet and Pinot noir. The au gratin potatoes were out of this world. The service was extraordinary! Our waiter was formal but also easy to connect with and made us feel at home. The owner happened to be dining there at the same time as us; he came over and chatted with further ensuring we had the best of nights. The pianist was amazing and asked for our special requests. Wonderful experience! Best we have had!",

He showed up several hours before my birthday dinner with a giant bouquet of flowers and requested the best table in the house he could find. As far as I was told, the house manager was very accommodating and walked him around the restaurant pointing out where the piano player would be, potential views, or flaws of each seat. He was not treated negatively because he was dressed very casually.  The restaurant stored the bouquet until our reservation (8:30). When we pulled up we were greeted by valet, and did not have to open the doors ourselves, there's a coat check, we were seated immediately! I do recommend, for an intimate date the two tables against the wall that gives one of the two partners direct view of the piano and both people large leather chairs. (In the rear of the picture I uploaded) For our needs though the booth seating was perfect! The piano was directly behind us, we were able to be as close as we wanted to each other, and the table is much larger than the other 2 person tables, allowing room for my bouquet and all our food. The restaurant was bustling even on a Monday! We met some truly great patrons that night, because they stopped by our table to compliment us or say hello. I think our table drew extra attention and people even held their breath for a proposal, but he's just that romantic all the time (haha!). I do echo some other reviews, we were the youngest BY FAR in this restaurant, but that's nothing new most 20 somethings aren't in an expensive, jacket required place.  Jackets required, even while seated, it's on the menu in case you forget. Classic 5 star restaurant service, chairs pulled for women, women served first, clean utensils, rimmed wineglasses, proper wine glasses, great ambiance, pristine bathrooms, tablecloths folded in your absence, purses allowed their own stools when needed, etc. In this regard, the restaurant is not just resting on a 50 year old reputation like some reviews allude to.  The servers work like a well tuned orchestra! Any conversations or corrections happen off stage left, it seems like the staff even walk in step! Hats off to the staff here, they really have mastered their field.  The creamed spinach was awesome, the swordfish was rather bland. I'm afraid I have to echo most reviews in the fact that my food wasn't great, hell I don't know if it was even good. But like some other reviews the overall experience for a special night was great. But for the quality of food Double Eagle Steak House, STK, and Charlie Palmer may win out.  As an added bonus the host is also your happy birthday opera singer! He sang to us in Italian and it was really neat. The birthday girl got a 24 K gold plate for my birthday dessert, complimentary of the chef.  Overall I can't wait to go back to try to sit at the bar, listen to the live music, and be back in the dark room, secret meeting type environment.",

We used the valet parking and were greeted by very nice gentlemen; then greeted at the door by the coat girl; then greeted by Paul Reosti (Maitre d') who was most congenial and gracious (also sings in Italian).  We went to the bar and Matt (bartender) was very efficient in serving the drinks and remembered all of names after introductions --very impressive!  Then off to our corner table and greeted by Phil (waiter) -- very professional in every way.  Again, we introduced ourselves to Phil and he stated that in all his years at the restaurant no one had ever introduced themselves and he thought this was great.  The wait staff was very attentive to making sure that all the drinks were filled and when clearing the table, you never knew they were there.  We started off with the lobster bisque -- outstanding!  The food was absolutely delicious --  the men had the prime rib, the ladies split a NY strip with the Chilean Sea Bass and we shared the garlic mashed potatoes and kale.  During dinner, a gentleman was playing classical music on the baby grand piano.  Again, everything was absolutely perfect in every way.  We certainly would recommend the Prime Rib and look forward to returning soon.  We give it 5 STARS!",
