I ordered a large and it was indeed large like I wanted. The chicken was grilled and absolutely delicious. Actual half chicken pieces. The collared greens and mac and cheese was fresh and good also. I loved the side of jerk sauce, and the chunky savory oxtail gravy the lady already knew to put on the rice. I didn't have to haggle for more in the plate, the large was worth the 13 bucks. I WILL BE COMING BACK THERE!!! The server was nice. The place is wheelchair accessible.  The only thing is they are CASH ONLY. ATM on the premises.",

Terrible Terrible Terrible \"customer service\"Now this is actually the second time that I called this restaurant. First time was only because they are the only Jamaican spot near by and second was just now to place an order. The lady answering the phone sounds miserable!!!! She hangs up the phone after I questioned the delivery process. I guess she was clueless so she hung up but to make matters worse when I called back & asked to speak with a manager she hangs up again & forwards my calls SO n/a.  I should of known better because my first experience was terrible, the delivery dude was truly disrespectful he spoke to me like I was asking for a freebie or some change in a cup BUT since it's been well past a few months I figured maybe the restaurant would be a bit different. Guess not! So my money won't even support a place with employees so disrespectful and unprofessional. Customer service is what draws people along side good food. You can forget me ever calling back or ordering there!!! Sad just so sad...",

The oxtails were decent, but I've still had better. My problem here, is that the food was cold, and the collard greens were from the bottom of the pot. They were extremely salty, and black bits in them. I decided to try it again, after getting off of work late one night. I ordered curried  chicken and rice. The same thing again! Cold food.  I had to warm it uo, which I regret because my stomach killed me the entire night. Beware people. I won't be back. Honestly the worse carribean place I've ever been to, especially being in New York",
