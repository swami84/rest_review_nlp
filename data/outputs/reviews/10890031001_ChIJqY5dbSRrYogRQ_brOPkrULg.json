When we said something about it, he said that the owner told them to change all of the TV's to something else. He didn't offer to change it back, so we asked him to, and he \"tried\" but couldn't figure out how to do it (lame), and then he just walked off without having put it back on the game we were watching, so we had to ask the lady behind the bar and she couldn't figure it out, so she went and got the owner, who put it on the correct channel for us. The owner then proceeded to curse loudly, and talk to the bartender about \"if anyone messed with her, to tell him and he would get his baseball bat out of the back and break some knee caps!\" He wasn't talking about us, but apparently someone else earlier in the day had said something to the bartender and made her feel uncomfortable. IDK He repeated this at least four times, and said that he was Italian, and it wouldn't be the first time he broke bones with a baseball bat. It was an awkward situation.",

The ditzy cashier forgot my lemonade. I called back and she told me to to come in after I just told her it was curbside, then she stated that there were people who needed to order and it would take a few minutes for her to bring my drink out as if I wasn\u2019t important. I had a sleeping 3 month old in my backseat which prevented me from coming in the store in the first place. I asked for a refund, she claimed she didn\u2019t know how. I asked for a manger, she said he wouldn\u2019t be back until 30 minutes later. So the store is being managed poorly without supervision. My only option was to leave my name and phone number and I told her I didn\u2019t get a receipt either. I\u2019m still waiting on a call back about my drink and dissatisfying experience.

        "caption": "Moe's BBQ has made for the worst possible neighbor to the people who live in the apartment building across the street. Instead of giving you a buzzer or having someone bring your order to your table, they announce orders over a loud speaker both inside and outside the restaurant. The outside loud speaker can literally be heard for blocks around. Why it needs to be that loud beats me, but needless to say it\u2019s really annoying for the people who live across the street to have to constantly hear \"Johnny, your order is ready\" throughout the evening. Their outdoor patio is empty now that the weather has turned colder, but the loud speaker announcements are still blaring away all the same. To make matters worse, they have also begun leaving their outdoor music running all night long, in clear violation of Huntsville's noise ordinance.  I\u2019ve reached out to the general manager at Moe\u2019s about it and they could not care less. Half the time they just hang up on you, while the other half they agree but do nothing. If you go over there in person and ask to talk to a manager, they\u2019ll tell you that he/she is busy and you should come back another time, or that they\u2019ll \u201cpass on the message\u201d.  So in short, don't support this business until they become a better neighbor.",

My number one choice is the smoked wings, with my second choice being their catfish.  I would also say Moe's might have the best hush puppies I've ever had.  I am very surprised to see some reviews regarding cold or not good food.  This really does surprise me as I have eaten at many Moe's and they have always been great IMO.   This location is so so to me and that is my opinion.  I am not big on the Downtown area mainly due to the annoyance of parking and having to walk to where you want to go.  There are very limited spots near Moe's and DO NOT park in the Apartment parking lot behind or you will be towed.  With that being said, this location is very cool and I would highly recommend at least trying it out.   When fall hits I want to go enjoy dinner on the roof.",

I told one of the girls and then a gentleman from the kitchen came over and asked me if he could get me something else. They never offered to give me my money back. I told him I would take the sliced turkey instead. He brought over some sliced turkey and a paper container with no sauce just four pieces of sliced turkey,  so I asked for sauce.  Then I overheard one of the kitchen guys Say the \u201cF\u201d word very loudly. Then another bartender/cook was running around asking everyone if they had baby powder because he was chafing. The gentleman who brought me the sliced turkey came by and to asked me if the turkey was better than the wings and I mentioned that at least it wasn\u2019t raw, he just laughed and went on. I would never expect this from this particular restaurant. I\u2019ve eaten at Moes for years!   Very disappointed!!!!!!",
