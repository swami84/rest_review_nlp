The waiter sits you at the table and brings tasty hot tea while you're browsing the menu. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced. I opted for some appetizers and an entree and was not disappointed. They were all delicious! Oh, the Thai BBQ ribs... The service was very humble, attentive and accommodating. I truly felt like I was being welcomed by the entire place. The manager (maybe owner) made his business to come over our table and ask if everything was to our satisfaction. And then they surprised me again. They offered a delicious ice cream dessert for free and my friend. I was told that I could have as much as I want. I asked for a second serving and was not turned down. The waiter was happy to bring me one! We left with an atmosphere, and joy. We were happy to leave 20% tip. On my way out I mentioned that they will get an unbiased review on Google and that's exactly what I'm doing right now. Visit this place and you will not be disappointed!",

The texture of the chicken in the sauce tasted like it was deep fried prior to being added instead of stewed which is the norm.  The chicken itself is questionable \u2013 hoping it\u2019s not pork.  The roti isn\u2019t the paper-thin crispy round 12-inch in diameter fresh roti you\u2019d expect.  It was 5-inches in diameter and dripping with oil inside and out.  Perhaps it was frozen and then deep fried?  The coconut rice had a strange green hue.  Why? And it didn\u2019t taste like coconut rice.  The Kang Kung Belachan tasted okay, until it didn\u2019t.  It was gritty and sandy.  Were these greens cleaned thoroughly?  These dishes are Malaysian-style not Malaysian and would probably appeal to some people who enjoy super oily food.  The staff was nice and the delivery was prompt.  Perhaps this was just a one-time coincidence with my particular order.  Everything looked and tasted quite unappetizing.  Wasting food isn\u2019t my thing but I had to chuck it after a few bites.  I gave this place a chance however, the food speaks for itself.",
