Now there is visible seats at the bar but I'm told to stop and wait because there isn't any space. I'm confused because I see at least 3 open seats. The greeter advised me that the bartender was really busy so I couldn't sit. Luckily my food was already ready and I was able to pay as I'm doing so 3 ladies white of course are leaving the bar. So needless to say my first impression is that this is clearly a racist establishment and prefers certain customers. Just disgusting and disappointing and as I write this I should have left my order to there. LESSON LEARNED",

I was originally going to just get takeout but then asked the hostess if I could eat at a table. She said I could sit at the bar which I did. The hostess brought the pizza to me at the bar and I paid her and gave her an approximately 40% gratuity. Because I did not order the pizza through him, the bartender, however, did not want to be bothered with me. I had to repeatedly ask him for water which I should not of had to do. If a water glass is empty, good service staff fill it with more water automatically but not this guy. The third time I asked him for more water I watched him serve all of the other people at the bar, get the servers their drinks and then talk a few minutes with the two other bar patrons before re-filling my water. He did not want to wait on someone else's customer who was only drinking water. I left the place thirsty because I did not want to go through that whole ordeal just for a glass of water.  On my way out, I talked to the manager. He agreed with me and said that he would have a talk with the bartender. But he did not appear to care. I told him that I was leaving his establishment thirsty because I did not want to go through the whole ordeal of getting another glass of water with my meal. A caring manager would have went and got his thirsty customer a glass of water but not this manager. I told the manager the whole story and that I regretted even setting foot in his restaurant. He did not even offer an apology. Never again!",

Register to get email updates on their weekly specials which change every Friday. They have updated their regular menu too. Can't say enough about Bill and all the wonderful staff. It's a little gem on Harrison St in Oak Park!  Was just dining here tonight and we had a group of 7 for dinner. We live near by but the rest of our party drove from quite away.

I immediately sent it back (wasn't charged) and in return I received Tilapia, which was basically a large burnt fish stick with tartar sauce! If you closed your eyes you would have no clue it was tilapia! I would not recommend. Oh, and the lemonade was dollar store powder packet quality, the nerve of them to put an actual lemon at the top, are you kidding me?! got my $$ back for that as well. the place looks awesome, very good ambiance, but the food, I wouldn't even give to a homeless cat.",

I ordered the pasta with the seafood in it and the pasta didn't taste fresh and homemade and the seafood tasted like it was from a bag of mixed frozen seafood. Something I could have made at home. This is the dish I order at every Italian restaurant and gauge the restaurant if they use fresh pasta and fresh seafood.",

Highly recommend the Duck Con Fit or chopped Italian salad or my favorite is \"The Goat\" pizza!! Not to mention their weekly seasonly specials they are always offering. Don't forget that they offer two for one pizza nights on Tuesdays!  Great location nestled in the heart of the Arts District in Oak Park. Tons of fabulous local artists display their work for free and I adore their bar area in case you just want a drink. I have brought several family members and friends here and they have all highly enjoyed their food. Hope you enjoy your food as much as I have!",

It was saltier than I like but I'm used to low salt. Wines were at a decent price and well poured. Nothing outstanding but drinkable. For dessert I had a disappointing \"something chocolate\" which was a chocolate bundt cake with vanilla gelato and chocolate and caramel sauces drizzle over. Not much chocolate flavor to the dry, cakey confection. I ordered a rye, Tempelton's, to go with it (I love the pairing of chocolate and bourbon). This was a more disappointing pour and I find Tempelton a thin rye, at best.. Next time, go for the Knob Creek with a side of water.  Altogether, a restaurant to keep my eye on and try again. It has potential. It can be real noisy with just a few people so plan accordingly.",
