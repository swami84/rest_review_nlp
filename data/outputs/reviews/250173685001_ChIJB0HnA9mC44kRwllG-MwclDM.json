The food on the other side, has its limitations. The food in general lacks flavors and falls more on the bland side. The burger and tacos were dry and needed salt, some sauce for spice / flavor. Fries were super greasy. Their desserts are good but overall, the food quality, taste and the price point are quite mismatched. PS: the place is loud. Be prepared for that",

I ordered the zucchini bread as I always do However I was not lucky, they made me disappointed. After my next table had their second zucchini bread and all the people in my table get their food, I still did not get my food. I asked the waitress, and she told me it was canceled. It was confused, but I finally get it. But it is not the bread as usual, the dough was dry and edge still was maybe uncooked throughly, just  dry and hard. Even the fork can not make it cut easily. It was also thinner than before and thinner than the two bread on my next table. I understand the size is varied every time, but just wish it can be normal quality and quantity, because it will be a long time I can not have it.  They apologized for these, maybe next they will be back to the normal. Anyway, it is a good restaurant, they provide good food most time. Maybe I am just not lucky this time, hope I can be lucky next time.",

She then proceeded to tell us that we couldn\u2019t if because that Stella only came in it\u2019s own style glass. I said I can\u2019t get a frosted mug for a beer ? She said no and was starting to argue with us. Then she said let me check by then I was saying I\u2019m going to have this kind of experience over a frosted beer glass for 10 dollars what\u2019s my experience going to be with a 150 dollar dinner.

There were no tables available so headed to the bar, ordered a burger without bun. It was all okay, but very greasy for my taste.  The truffle fries would have been awesome but they were soggy from the oil.  Same for the burger which was probably just put on straight from the frying pan making the lettuce soaking in oil too... Maybe you get different stuff at the bar not sure but it is really not a place to return for food. However the 3 star is for the staff.  I did not get cutleries and when I asked from a waitress (who clearly should not helping me out at the bar) had no issues to drop everything and give me a set. The bartender who took my order (then I think he went for a break or finished his shift and the girls who replaced him did not show interest in checking on me though) was sweet remembered all details of the order; the concierge girl was sweet and enthusiastic about the place so I still think that this is a good place or one with potential.",

I enjoyed it because I was with my daughters whom I had the good fortune to see less than 12 hours in exactly 13 years. A few hours ago (date and place set by my daughters), it was 13 years since I was arrested by the German authorities on false public writings, at the request of the Massachusetts authorities, WITHOUT ANY LEGAL BASIS. My daughters were, then, kidnapped and \"returned\" by the \"Teutons\" in the United States. At other times the name of \"deportation\" was given to this practice. I let you use the word \"fair\" about the German practices of 75 years ago !!! Word, in Germany, who can drive you to prison, if you use it. Yet this is what it is.  (Original) Un lieu comme un autre pour d\u00e9jeuner. Rien de sp\u00e9cial ! J'ai beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 parce que j'\u00e9tais en compagnie de mes filles que je n'ai eu le bonheur de voir que moins de 12 heures en exactement 13 ans. A quelques heures pr\u00e8s (date et lieu fix\u00e9s par mes filles), cela faisait 13 ans que j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s allemandes sur des faux en \u00e9critures publiques, \u00e0 la demande des autorit\u00e9s du Massachusetts, SANS AUCUNE BASE L\u00c9GALE.  Mes filles m'ont,  alors, \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9es et \"renvoy\u00e9es\" par les \"teutons\" aux \u00c9tats Unis.  En d'autres temps on donnait le nom de \"d\u00e9portation\" \u00e0 cette pratique. Je vous laisse utiliser le mot \"juste\" au sujet des pratiques allemandes d'il y a 75 ans !!! Mot, en Allemagne, qui peut vous conduire en prison, si vous l'employer. Pourtant il s'agit bien de cela.",

By the time we were leaving, a live band was setting up to start playing (I think).  The tacos were amazing and they were great about accommodating for GF, vegan, and vegetarian needs.Their menu has AGF for available gluten free; just tell your waiter(ess).  I had their cauliflower tacos and you couldn't even tell the cauliflower was there; the combination of flavors created an amazing tastebud experience.  We also got the flourless chocolate cake, which was so rich it almost wasn't finished; it is definitely made for 2 or 3 people and major chocolate lovers.",

It was anything but quick.  Bartender took forever to take our orders and make drinks - not because it was busy, but because there were co-workers sitting at the bar and clearly socializing was more important.  We only had 1 drink each (because we were never offered a second), and after our meal, it took 20 minutes just to get the check.  Probably would've taken even longer to if I didn't flag her down.  After that, she never came back to take our card and I literally had to wave it in her face.  Turns out one of the \"coworkers\" she was busy flirting with is the managing partner, so I guess we now understand why!  Really unprofessional of both parties.",

Instead of ordering entrees we decided to order some of the smaller plates and we were not disappointed. The oysters were fresh and to our surprise only $1 each during happy hour! The crab-cakes were so good we placed a second order. The watermelon salad was refreshing and paired perfectly with the oysters. We capped the meal with a brownie sundae to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and left with full bellies and smiles on our faces.  Will definitely come back next time we are in town.",

I was honestly really disappointed . I don't care it was the not so great cook on duty that night. I'm just saying as a first time experience, definitely the worst food I ever had at a restaurant.

Bistro781 is staple on the Moody Street scene; only opening in July 2015 This is without a doubt one of the best establishments I've ever been to.  my wife and I stopped in on Tuesday Night, and we were helped by Lauren, who was on point and so very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere with low lighting and tables on one side, and a bar and tvs on the other side. Both restaurant and restrooms in establishment were very clean.  I ordered a delicious (but not for those who are dieting) Jalapeno Popper Burger, which was served with fries. This burger is deep fried, but don't let that push you away. It's served with fries (which were amazingly seasoned and crispy) and Texas Toast as a bun.  My Girlfriend had Tomato and Goat Cheese stuffed Chicken served with asparagus and a baked potato. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly.The only thing lacking on this dish was a bit more of the chicken gravy for use on the baked potato.  We ended dinner with a macaroon desert. This plate came with three macaroons; cheesecake, orange creme, and mint chocolate. It was a very attractive and sweet dish.  There is free parking for this restaurant as well. It is about two blocks down Gordon street. There's a big Bistro 781 sign and a huge lot.  Overall, I would recommend Bistro781 for it's food and service. I would definitely suggest this as a great place for a casual date, and prices are good; about 16-20$ a plate.",
