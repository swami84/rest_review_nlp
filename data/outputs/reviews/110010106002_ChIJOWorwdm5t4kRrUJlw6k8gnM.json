        "caption": "VEGAN ONLY MENU REVIEW : Such a bummer experience. My date and I ordered 4 items off the vegan menu: The Poh Pia spring rolls were tasty (served with a sweet & sour type sauce) however was a bit confused as the menu description highly suggested we wrap the rolls in lettuce before dipping/eating. Six small rolls + 3 small pieces of lettuce = 3 stragglers without a blanket. The other appetizer we ordered, Bai Mun (flat fried potato leaves) roughly the equivalent of a kale chip but thinner/more airy. At a $6.00 price point we were shocked to see maybe six leaves on the plate. Either serve 4x that amount or take it off the menu. I honestly sat and looked at the plate for a few seconds thinking that it was a mistake.  We were pretty hungry so we each got one of the two main tofu dishes, he got the flat noodles and I got the fried rice. My portions were very big, while his was much smaller. The noodles were okay and the tofu in each dish was good, but the rice was flavorless and also a tad bitter with the scallions/unseasoned broccoli/cabbage. To power through the dish I ended up using all the remaining appetizer sauces and sriracha to help the rice along. It was a TON of rice, just not in a good way. :(  Server was friendly but didn't really listen when I tried to respond to his \"how is everything?\" question. I started to ask him about the leafy appetizer and he said \"okay great!\" and walked away. So odd. We skipped dessert because we were already let down and didn't feel like adding to the bill. Honestly we were very excited to eat here, but we won't be back. Sad times.",

I never had Laotian food before Laos in Town, so I looked forward to it. I wanted to experience the food without the hefty airlines ticket and 24 hour flight.  We were seated promptly upon arriving with a reservation. Apparently there was a vegetarian menu, but since we were omnivores, we skipped on that.  Kate took care of us really well and made some very good recommendations on drinks and food: I had the fighting tiger and top notch. They put up a fight and were both top notch.  Food-wise, I loved the strong flavors and aromas of the dishes we ordered. I'd recommend these 3 dishes if you want something exotic and special to this restaurant: - Herbal pork sausage: tasty with lemongrass and peppercorn - Seen hang: Laotian beef jerky. A good snack food. - Crispy rice salad: strong in flavor but balanced with the freshness of the salad, and crunchy in texture.  Although the other dishes are on the menu at other Thai or Asian restaurants, these are good in their own rights at Laos in Town: - Calamalao : big rings of squids fried with slight batter. - Grilled beef: tender and seasoned the Asian way. - Khua mee: pad thai served in a small wok  Overall, I am glad I was able to experience something old and new, strange and familiar.",

DONT GET MAD ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE WINGS, they are small but so worth it because they are packed with flavor and the sauce that comes with them tastes so good. And the Butterfly Lemonade is an amazing drink, get it! The entrees are all great and if you still have space after get their mango sticky rice, what a great sweet! Also big shoutout to Flo who waited on us the first time and always talked to us and was funny and friendly when we would return. 5/5 stars!",

I had the dish within 5 minutes.  I was really pleased with the spice amount as should be expected from an ethnic restaurant in cosmopolitan D.C. About two thirds of my to go box was a sticky white rice which initially turned me off but became necessary to  balance the heat from the food. I wish they'd have included a wedge of lime or a picked radish or something to break up the monotony of the dish.  Overall it's a gorgeous restaurant which had a great flavorful entree that I will hopefully have a chance to go back to for a seated occasion and more leasierly exploration of Laotian cuisine.",

My experience started off kind of poorly because the bartender didn't acknowledge me until I finally said \"Hey! May I please have a menu and order and drink?\" That was after waiting about 8 minutes for her to look at me, although...she knew I was there because I asked if the seat was empty when I arrived. The atmosphere is fantastic. I love that you can sit outside (with a dog) right at the bar. The inside looks beautiful although I remained outdoors. I order 2 apps for there and then a bunch of other items to go. The jumbo prawns were good and the dipping sauce was very nice and spicy. That's where the good stuff ends. I also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and even though the chicken was flavorful and nice, it was a very tiny amount. I can't imagine trying to share that appetizer with another person. I ordered a pulled chicken soup that was full of mushrooms, a tiny amount of chicken, and A LOT of lemon flavor. For an $8 soup, it was tiny. The menu also said it had a \"spicy aftertaste\" but that certainly was not the case. I also ordered the Signature salad and will admit, I had no clue it wouldn't be a salad at all. My bad. It looked like a Thai dish with thin sprouts, some sort of pork patty, a fee green beans and what looked like pork rinds (?), It was just meh. The biggest disappointment was the grilled beef main dish. For $18, I got about 10 very thin slices of beef, placed on a banana leaf with a glob of sticky rice on the side. The rough ground chili sauce that it's supposed to be dressed with was barely noticeable and definitely not spicy. The price of this dish is outstanding considering the tiny amount of food. I also ordered dessert of course...mango sticky rice. The mango was served with the peel still attached. Is that a thing?? I've never seen that before and I can't imagine trying to eat that appropriately if dining there. Over all, after an $87 meal, I'm still hungry and really disappointed. Was really looking forward to a new, interesting restaurant to try. I'd go back, but only for drinks, and only if there's a new bartender. Bummer.",

        "caption": "I went here last night with my friends and we were all a bit disappointed with the portion of the food that came out for the price that we had to pay. We ordered 3 different appetizers ($7-$8 each) and all of them were microscopic, every time the server placed down a plate, we all had the same feeling, \u201cThat\u2019s it??\u201d The poh pia (eggrolls) were so TINY. The restaurant surely can afford to give each person one WHOLE eggroll instead of cutting up one piece into 4 microscopic pieces for us to fight over, especially for the price that we\u2019re paying. The main entrees then came out. Again, the portion sizes were so, SO small. These entrees are not cheap and for the amount we\u2019re paying, we expected to receive more food. The restaurant is definitely stingy on their ingredients and you\u2019ll constantly be thinking, \u201cWow, that\u2019s all the food I get for $15? What a rip off.\u201d The menu items are equivalent to typical street food you\u2019d find in Thailand, but here they try to spin it as if they\u2019re fancy dishes and therefore slap a high price tag on it. Papaya salads in Thailand/Laos are equivalent to $1 street tacos that some lady is selling off of a cart, not some luxurious gourmet item whatsoever. Same with the chicken and sticky rice, $13 for one chicken leg quarter and a tiny amount of sticky rice, what the heck? Go to Thailand and that\u2019s like buying a hot dog.  The bathroom looks nice, but there\u2019s no toilet seat cover. What do they do instead? Leave a bottle of sanitizer and paper towels for you to wipe the toilet seat. You get to be both a customer and a custodial worker at the same time.",
