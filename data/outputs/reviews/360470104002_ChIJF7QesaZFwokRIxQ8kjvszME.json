        "caption": "I was really excited to try this because it was new. Inside it really clean and nice. There is a roasted meats counter at the front that is popular.  The servers are new and were flustered and kept telling the kitchen to hurry with our dishes because they thought that we were waiting for too long. I felt so bad because we weren't in a rush and it's not like we were upset. They were very attentive so that's nice.  We ordered the borscht soup which had a really good flavor, but it was too peppery. The second time we ordered the soup, it had hot chili in it so it was just plain spicy with no other flavor. The curry chicken over rice was just spicy and didn't have any other flavor so that was disappointing. The sushi sandwich was overly sweet? It has sushi rice and Kani salad and a sweet mayo sauce. The Mayo sauce was good at first but then eating 2 of the sushi sandwiches made it too sweet. The owner told us that it was really popular so we ordered it. It's a good gimmick if you want to try something new.  We came back another time and ordered the sushi combo b, baked chicken over rice with red sauce, and stir fried rice cakes. My parents got a different sushi/sashimi set a different time and they said it was really fresh, so I wanted the sushi combo. It had fresh tuna and salmon. There was also white tuna and whitefish. The California and salmon rolls were good. The baked chicken over rice was good but I wish there was a little more sauce. Stir-fried rice cakes smelled really good when it came out but i think they over cooked it because the rice cakes were way too sticky. It also didn't have any flavor other than the salty preserved veg that came with it.  Overall, I'm excited because this is something new for 8th ave, but there's definitely room for improvement.",
