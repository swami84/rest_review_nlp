Really disappointed especially when you're paying over $20 for the wings. The place was not busy when I got there, I was probably the 7th person and my server forgot my order of accompanying Saporo.

Good mix of music is playing, but the space can get a little echoey when there's a lot of people talking. The food is a mix of traditional and fusion Korean food. We tried a mix of dishes and were satisfied with everything. The standout dishes were the hot stone fresh garlic chicken, the sweet potato fries, yaki udon, and the butter garlic squid. The service was fast and very friendly...our waiter made great recommendations, and the chef came out to see how we liked the dishes twice...he even gave us a little plate of the sweet and sour chicken to try it out. Chicken prices are a little expensive ($19 to $24 per family style dish), but we were told that they use free range organic chicken. We will definitely be back.",

        "caption": "Delicious!!!  I have been here for a few weeks and I've passed by this place a few times so I figured why not stop by.  It's nice because they don't close until 2:00 a.m. so I did not feel the need to rush over.  Upon arriving I was greeted and offered a seat anywhere I wanted. I picked a seat and was told I couldn't sit at that table... Not a big deal the place had enough open seats so it was not a real issue.  During my time, people came and went at a constant pace so while it was not crowded I was not all alone.  There is a nice selection of items, pork, seafood, beef and most of all CHICKEN! I ordered the Kahuku Shrimp,Garlic Shoyu Chicken, and fries.  Be prepared  for steep surcharges for any alterations to menu items.  For example there is a spicy chicken dish for $21, the garlic Shoyu for 23, and a combination for $24.  I asked the waiter which he recommended between the spicy and the shoyu and he suggested a combination.  BUT there would be a $5 upcharge if I wanted spicy.  For me the math did not work out so I opted for the Garlic Shoyu and I an glad I went that route. The chicken was amazing. Nice crispy, juicy, full of flavor and surprisingly not overpowered by the garlic. One last note about the chicken, the portion size is massive.  I can eat and I barely made it through half of the order.  The shrimp on the other hand I had mixed feelings.  First off they give you these gigantic shrimp (which I loved), but were a little over cooked for my preference. The flavor however was good. Salty, garlicky, yummy is about how I would explain it although I know that's not a great represantion of the dish. Like the chicken this is more than enough to share with a group.  All of the staff were super pleasant and made sure i was well taken care of. This place is not cheap but definitely worth the expense because of the quality and taste of the food, the convenience of the late night hours and the pleasant staff.  When you come here, bring a friend, an appetite and have some fun.",
