We were seated promptly when we arrived at our reservation time which can't be taken for granted with some restaurants in the same neighborhood. Our server was Jim and he was perfectly attentive and helpful without being obtrusive. I had the prime rib and she had the shrimp and both were exquisitely prepared and delicious. The beer pairings complemented our dinner perfectly. I will absolutely be back for lunch or dinner sometime soon. If you go, ask for Jim!",

Their beer selection was also solid, I wish there were more dark beer options but the bourbon barrel aged oatmeal stout they had was fantastic. I was in heaven the whole time, also our server Mike was very helpful and was informative about any menu option we expressed interest in. Never felt pressured and felt like he really took the time to make sure we were taken care of. Ballsy move to open during a pandemic but they got something great here.",

All servers wore masks and gloves diligently and workers in the kitchen were all seen with masks as well. Food was phenomenal. The 2 appetizers we ordered Chips & Guac and Spinach Artichoke Dip was enough to satisfy our table of 5 before the meal. Mahi Mahi sandwich was charred perfectly and had excellent flavor. The side of charred broccoli was flavorful (balsamic possibly) and was cooked to perfection. Overall the portion sizes were large and most of us had to bring home leftovers. Server, Mike, was very friendly and respectful. He did a very good job handling larger parties and always came around to check on us. Overall I would definitely be back and hope this place hangs around for a while!",
