I Wasn't expecting much but was hungry and wanted to end my night with couple of slices. I decided to go with a pepperoni Slice and another interesting looking slice with chicken ? & prochuito ? Not sure, remember I was drunk. Their slices are very big and they use a generous amount of cheese and toppings. The crust is crispy and thin and real absorbs that brick oven flavor. The pepperoni slice is rated highly among pizza shops that I frequent and the other slice that I can't accurately describe was OUTSTANDING. It's up there with the best slices I've had in recent memory.  This place gets 5 stars. They are open late, the pizza is excellent and they accept debit. This spot is an exception the trend of terrible pizza that has taken over this town. I will make this part of my ritual whenever I'm at Barclays",
