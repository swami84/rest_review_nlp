She did however let us know that an exterminator had been there prior to opening that day (so this is an issue obviously). Very uncomfortable experience after, could not enjoy my over priced appetizer, entree or drink.  I sat the rest of my time there with my feet up! You could hear the tussle of these rats, probably near the trap(s) in the gangway!  Very much regret not getting up and leaving after seeing the first rat.  I sent the restaurant a follow email which was never answered or acknowledged.  Pretty disappointing Cebu. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Now I understand completely that there is a rodent issue in the city of Chicago, but maybe patios like theirs shouldn\u2019t be open if there is such an issue?",

The food came out before the drinks.  Looks like they\u2019re still working on their flow here.  My partner ordered the mango drink and commented that it wasn\u2019t as sweet as she had hoped it would be. She also said that it didn\u2019t taste much like mango.  I enjoyed the drink I ordered (Cebu later?) wish it had more of a tamarind taste. Strong drinks if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for.  The meals were great but too expensive for the prices paid in my opinion. Portions were a bit smaller than I expected.  Dessert was amazing. 5/5  I think moving forward we\u2019ll come for drinks and dessert after eating somewhere else.",

Since the city is such a huge melting pot of people and cultures, you generally have specific areas where you'll find certain types of cuisine. Luckily, enter Cebu with reminiscent flavors of traditional Filipino cuisine, as well as modern spin of classic dishes. Take their Chicken and Waffle for example: inclusive of boneless deep fried chicken, it's paired with an untraditional Pandan syrup and Ube butter. You can space the regular waffle for a Ube waffle and get Ube syrup as well. I decided to over indulge and got all the fixings! If you want to try their Lechon, go for the Lechon Benedict on their brunch menu. It's decently sized and definitely shareable. You don't need to order the half/whole portion. If you're going to aim for dessert, the The Churro Bowl is good but tiny. When it arrived on the table, I was taken back a bit. Had I known the size, I would've ordered another dessert without hesitation.",

Our service was attentive and we got a lot of food for a reasonable price. The best dish we had by far was the chicken adobo, which was well cooked and flavorful. Unfortunately, the BBQ skewers were very fatty. The pork belly was unique and had a layer of very crunchy skin on the outside which was a fun sensory experience, but the pork belly was not cooked down very much so the large amount of fat was overwhelming and not soft and tender. The pork belly was bland without the sauce. Overall, I had hoped for bolder flavors and to be amazed by the experience.",

Every single bite was AMAZING! Their shaved desert halo-halo and the cheesecake were so delicious too. Lastly, we had some very cool and unique cocktails that I think I\u2019ve never tried anywhere in Chicago. Cebu has become one of our favorite restaurants in Bucktown/Wicker Park!",

The entrees are a la carte, so no bread, no rice comes with them. We shelled out for the bread, as it is a kind of bread that isn't easy to find around here and is pleasingly reminiscent of the milk bread I knew and loved in Tokyo, but didn't want to shell out for the rice as well--although the chicken adobo doesn't really make sense without it. Their take on pancit, Bam-I, would do better with more vegetables and less meat, or at least that option, as well as better separation of the rice noodles--the dish we were served had several clumps that bordered on inedible. The flavors on the whole were good, and as this place is pretty newly opened perhaps a little time will refine or expand their menu. As it stands, it is not likely we will return to pay $9 for six small lumpia. Additionally, our server asked if there were any dietary concerns and I told him I was allergic to corn. We then ordered the bread that he neglected to tell us had cornmeal on the top, and had to ask to find out. Two stars lost due to this fail.",

We also ordered cocktails, and they were done really well and were pretty strong. The inside was designed pretty nicely, so there's a good ambiance in there. We didn't get to sit outside, but the back patio looked pretty nice as well. Overall, I would highly recommend checking this place out. It's definitely unique and high quality.",

The sisig is overfilled with onions to the point that you can't taste the pork. the lumpia was okay, not good enough to cost $9 for the six pieces. The pork bbq was the only good thing we had, but for the price, it's not worth coming back. I haven't tried anything from the special menu since they sold out on the pork bellies and the lechon manok. The cocktails look good, but I haven't tried it. If you're here to experience good Filipino food, let alone Cebuano food, I don't think you'll get it. I'm giving it 3 stars in the hope that the food I missed out on is good.",

I ordered the Average Joe cocktail, which despite its name was anything but average. It was not too sweet and fairly strong. I loved the addition of the dried mango too.  I had the lechon belly with steamed rice for my main entree. The meat was super juicy and paired excellently with the sauces. I can't speak to the authenticity of the dish, but the Filipino patron next to me noted that it was similar to how her father made it at home. A caution to others: this meal is big and likely meant for two, unless you're particularly hungry.  I also saw another customer eating the Halo Halo, which looked phenomenal. I would have ordered it but I was way too stuffed from my main entree alone. I'll definitely order this the next time I come!",

It didn't go well together it just ruined the sisig. I don't know why it had jalapenos in it also. It should be the small chili peppers like the thai ones. The pork skewers were ok, not the best. They were tender but so tiny. The atchara or whatever that was they served with it was so bland. The food was way too pricey for the portions they give you. I wouldn't mind if the food was actually great and worth it but it wasn't. We didn't bother with desserts anymore. We already knew we'd be disappointed at that point.

It had such a splendid blend of flavors, crisp and not too spicy.  Finally, we ordered two deserts (halo-halo a calamansy tart). It was a great culmination of the dinner.

Overall, some dishes were good, some just fell flat. I'm not sure if we just happened to get some off dishes for the night but, even so, that's no excuse. First, I'll start off by saying that I love the space. The staff was friendly and the service was great. I came with a group of friends, some Filipino, some not. Some of the dishes we wanted to try out were already sold out. So maybe those were knock out dishes that might have changed our experience. We ordered some appetizers (lumpia, pork skewers, pandesal (bread), and a salad with duck egg). Unfortunately, the lumpia, which is like a Filipino eggroll was crispy on the top and a bit soggy on the bottom. That usually means it was sitting too long to cool off. The rest of the apps were good. As for main dishes, we ordered the Sisig and that was a bit disappointing. It's supposed to be served searing hot (imagine a steak fajita platter) topped with an egg. It was just warm and the texture was a bit off. It didn't have the flavorful meat or crunch you would expect with it. The chicken adobo was ok. I think they added coconut milk to it which I think made it a little more creamier and lost the punch that you'd expect in flavor of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. The chicken was cooked well though. The thing that disappointed us the most was the Pork Belly. I've read other reviews and people seems to love it. What makes pork belly amazing is the crackling crunch of the skin, and that fat of the pork melts into the meat, so it's really juicy and flavorful. Our was the opposite. The meat was dry and the skin was rubbery. We immediate knew it was not good when we tried to cut into the skin and it felt like cutting rubber. The dinner ended on a high note in which we all enjoy Halo-Halo (a dessert worth coming for). For those who don't know anything about Filipino food, they'll walk away thinking it was a good meal. For someone like me who is open to Filipino culinary fusions, making a twist on classic dishes, etc....the entrees we had fell flat. I did make plans with another group of friends to check this place out, so I'm giving it another shot. I hope it's better the second time around.",

We ordered the Kinilaw (Ceviche) appetizer, the Chicken Adobo and Pork BBQ skewer entrees, a side of garlic rice and a glass of wine and a cocktail drink.  We received the side of rice before the appetizer came, then the ceviche 10 minutes later. Finally after about 25 minutes we received the chicken adobo.  The second entr\u00e9e, the BBQ skewers never arrived. We had also ordered an extra glass of wine that didn\u2019t arrive. After starring at the empty plates for an extra 20 minutes the waitress asked if we wanted dessert even though the second entr\u00e9e and the additional glass of wine never came. We asked if it was normal to have the side of rice come before all our food and the waitress told us that it was customary in Filipino cooking to receive the rice before anything else. We had spent the previous summer in the actual island of Cebu, Philippines and never experience this tradition.  We really wanted to like the neighborhood spot but the service was awful and the food wasn\u2019t bad despite not getting the full order. Can\u2019t recommend it unfortunately, hopefully they can address the bad service.",

Very subtle with robust, tarty sour but sweet and not over powering. Also, the tanduay ice cream was amazing been mixing tanduay with vanilla ice cream for my cocktails with pineapple or mangos this one slay it!!",

        "caption": "A great Filipino restaurant that's worth checking out. The menu is small, but it includes Filipino favorites and staples like adobo, lumpia, and sisig. All of the dishes were great, and the Filipino friends I was dining with felt like they were very authentic. Personally, I felt like the menu was lacking a noodle dish, like pancit. The service was also great - attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable.  The price was on the high side! But it was worth a splurge.",
