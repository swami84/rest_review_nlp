I'm always willing to try something new but I wouldn't recommend buying it. BBQ Chicken and Coconut shrimp combo tasted ok, average ish, but was extremely overpriced for very average food. It was a few small pieces of chicken, mostly diced chicken, three medium sized shrimp cut butterfly style to look larger. It came with corn, rice, a small (medium dressing sized container) of standard deli macaroni salad, but was advertised as hawaiian macaroni. Paid an extra $1 for garlic rice. Felt like a cheap meal, not a $20 meal, better can be had for that price, hence this review.  Overall I would buy the sushi again but would not recommend the food. It's basically bodega rice and chicken for $5 more.",

The delivery man came right at the time requested, everything was there, clearly labeled, and packed in a way that was both practical and environmentally responsible, with only metal trays, no plastic.

When I got my food I was so excited because everything looked great. The first thing i took a bite off was the pork gyozas. The gyozas themselves were not bad aside from being very greasy and the sauce on the side was sooo salty that I wasn\u2019t able to enjoy them. Then I had a fish taco, I got it because it\u2019s apparently a favorite item on Grubhub but i though the fish was under-seasoned and bland and the tortilla was burnt.. it looked like the put it on a grill and forgot about it. It had a bitter burnt taste and it smelled like burnt. It ruined the whole taco. I didn\u2019t get to taste the chicken one because my boyfriend ate that one but he said it was pretty good. Then I had the pulled pork and same thing burnt tortilla, flavor wasn\u2019t too bad but the meat was very dry. I got the mango bubble tea. The tapioca balls where very hard and they were all stuck together so I couldn\u2019t get most of them which ruined the experience, and the drink itself was very thick with an odd after taste. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ordering from this place again. I\u2019m very dissatisfied.",
