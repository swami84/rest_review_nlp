Service was quick. Pina colada was served in a fresh pineapple. I almost finished by the end of the night. The singer for the night got people to go up and dance to all the old hits she did a cover of. So many locals join in from young to old.  This bar definitely attracts a fun crowd. Beside dancing, many people are just here to relax and hang out with company. It was also convenience for us because it was in Waikiki so it wasn't too bad of a walk. Glad we stumbled upon this bar. A great way to start off the vacation.",

However, trust me when I say you just have to sit down, order a drink, and get settled in for the live music.  Bit by bit, you slowly realize that you're having a blast. The singer has an incredible voice and makes the experience interactive, the people all around you are extremely friendly and everyone is dancing and tapping their feet along with the music. The drinks themselves while generically named taste refreshing and balanced.  I came here at 730pm on a Friday night with my girlfriend and her parents. We had planned on leaving at 815-830pm after we finished a drink. We ended up staying past 10pm, dancing and just having a great time.  I know this place isn't for everyone and I'm sure the ambiance changes based on who's currently there in the moment. However, just keep an open mind and take a chance. You may end up having way more fun than you thought you would!",

We arranged to meet up for drinks here at around 10pm as the advised closing time was 12pm. We arrived in good spirits and walked in the front door about to enjoy a few drinks. Within seconds of entering a grumpy voice greeted us saying excuse me tourists we are closed. We replied by saying sorry sir we are here for a few drinks and will be gone by 12pm. The bar tender then confronted my female friend in an aggressive manner and said we are sick of you foreigners coming here and thinking you can do what we want. I felt incredible embarrassment and my female friend was in tears as we left. This made me feel sick right to my core and the first time I've felt discrimination or racism head on. Never go to this place, ever I can't stress this enough.",

The \u201creal pina colada\u201d is served in a real pineapple but lacks the sweetness one usually associates with a pina, tasting about like a shot of rum in a cored pineapple. Truly, this isn\u2019t a $17 drink (really $20 with tax and tip!) The Mai Thai is similar - very strong, like strawberry kool aid with two shots of vodka. The music can also be ear-splitting, we actually left without ordering the first time we visited because we couldn\u2019t even hear each other talk. If we come back here again, it\u2019ll be for the atmosphere and live music - as long as we don\u2019t need earplugs!",

Cons: We ordered two fish and chips and the amount of fries was laughable; they served such small portions, like they were rationing their fries! Server never came back around after dropping off food so we couldn\u2019t ask about it. My sister ordered the pineapple coconut cocktail and while it looked pretty, the drink mix was not very good and it was watery. I ordered the \u2018tipsy tiki\u2019 cocktail and it also tasted watered down (like when ice sits in a drink too long). Son ordered the hamburger and the meat was very overcooked. Servers were shy and nice but overall staff was not very attentive or helpful. They don\u2019t have kids menus either. Cutlery is all plasticware, disposable plates, styrofoam water cups and disposable plastic drinking cups. Felt more like a picnic :-/  Pros: the live music was fun playing 60s and 70s music, and the decor made it feel festive.  But overall, an overpriced tourist bar that we probably won\u2019t come back to.",

As we walked by the first entrance for Cuckoo Coconuts we heard my new favourite band, The Oldies and Goodies Band. We peeked inside and saw people dancing and having a good time but we were hungry and heading for hotpot so we started walking on.  Thank all of the Tikis God's that there was a second entrance door because as we walked by again, we could not resist the sounds of The Oldies and Goodies Band and the opportunity to people watch (bc there were a lot of people ripping up the little D floor) so we went in for a drink.  Our vacation in Waikiki is not done yet, butletmetellya....our night at Cuckoo Coconuts was the BEST TIME EVER. We drank out of pineapples (their drinks are delicious!) and we danced our hearts out and sang along with the band. We initially went in for one pineapple drink and ended up staying for 2.5 more hours just to dance to our new favourite band.  Guys and gals, go here. Do it. Trust me. Especially on Monday and Thursday nights when The Oldies and Goodies Band is playing. You are guaranteed going to have a great time. The drinks were tasty and reasonably priced, the staff were awesome and friendly, the Tiki atmosphere was wickedly cheesy and the band was the best!",

The food took a long time to come out as well- and the order was not right. What we recieved was good tasting though (one of the poke bowls) so it was fine. However, we never were served water! I raised my hand for five minutes, trying to call attention over to get a glass of water. Finally when I was close to being done eating I was served a drink. I also got an alcoholic beverage which was actually very good.  This place is also NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.  I would never go again because of how wasteful it is. If you care about the planet at all, go somewhere else. Nothing is reusable. They use plastic cups for alcoholic drinks, styrofoam cups for water, plastic cutlery, paper plates etc for serving. It is incredibly disappointing.  Take your money elsewhere. It is nothing special and very wasteful. You can get delicious food and drinks with better service and less waste at just about any restaurant in Waikiki.",

The atmosphere of the southern country is not hemispheric, mostly Westerners and only Japanese pair of us other than us. When the play of the raw band began, everyone danced out and we also put them in that circle and it got exciting! It became the highest fun night! A We drank 3 cups of beer, we had $ 7 beer, $ 10 for Maitai, $ 14 for liquor in coconut, 15% for chips, totaling $ 37. There were many people of the same generation (40s, 50s, 60s), so it was okay to dance if the words did not communicate ~ It became a store I want to visit again.

If you find your drink is too strong you can just ask for another or ask to have more Juice added and they will gladly help you out with that.  Great Live Music and Love the Vibe inside.

The food is Hawaiian bar/comfort food, the drinks are generous and extravagent, served in pineapples and coconuts.  The band was awesome, fantastic music, mostly old classic rock and some pop and Latin to round. It out.

Had a free birthday drink after coming here every night of my stay. In my opinion, THIS is Hawaii! Completely worth a stop on your visit to Oahu/Waikiki. Easy to get to, in the middle of the action, yet tucked away like a secret hideaway! All outdoor, hidden away in an alley behind some clothing and knock knack vendors, but covered by a umbrellas and greenery. An authentic timing vibe. Super fun, great live music with just the right amount of fun audience interaction, and of course, alcohol and food. Best thing is the Pina Coladas in a pineapple, there's also a more affordable version in a glass for those on a budget. This place makes me want to stay and become a local! LOVE IT!",
