One thing that put a salty taste in my month (no pun intended) was when they served the cake my family purchased elsewhere. We all thought that the cake tasted a bit off but it wasn't till we got home that we realized that they added salt to each piece of the cake that they served us. This was probably the most disrespectful thing that has happened to me and a party.",

My gfs and I came here Saturday night for the \"dinner in the igloo\" experience--the igloo is located outside on their penthouse level but they are individually heated.  The igloos are well-lit and pretty--the d\u00e9cor and furniture inside are very chic!  Definitely picture-worthy here.  They also provide a Bluetooth speaker so that you can connect to your phone to play music!  There is a rental fee, but there was a special at the time I reserved the igloos so the rental fee was waived--however, I was required to make a $100 deposit that would be applied to the food & beverage minimum.  I had some questions regarding the booking and information that was posted online that seemed confusing--it was so hard to reach anyone at the restaurant--I called multiple evenings in a row and no one would pick up the phone calls--pretty frustrating.  I also emailed the restaurant and no one got back to me.  Food: There is a special Igloo Dinner Menu to order from.  Everything was amazing!  Our top favorites (and highly recommend) were the Roasted Lamb, Maryland Blue Crab Tartine, and the 18 oz. Bone-In Dry Age Ribeye.  For dessert, the Tiramisu was delicious!  Drinks are pricey here--their Specialty Cocktails were $25 each, and a basic cocktail like gin & club soda was $19.  Overall, the ambiance, service and food was great!",

They were extremely busy and there was NO Social Distancing in place. When we were finally allowed upstairs, we had to wait again, standing again and NO Social Distancing, again.  At the entrance we had to make our way to the reception, it was crowded with people waiting and people from a wedding engaging in conversations. It was like we were at a club. I sent an email to management but no one responded in acknowledgment. That says a lot.",

Unfortunately, due to the serve rainstorm which as a result caused horrific traffic; I arrived at LA Vie at 2:12 pm checked in and was asked to take my temperature, which I did. Once that was completed the receptionist told me that my table (that should have already been ready at 2:00 pm) was not available and that I would need to have a seat in the lobby and wait for it. I decided to use the restroom instead as I wait for the table. Around 2:16 pm I returned to the lobby. At this point the second half to my party (party of 2) arrived and had already checked in. I approached the reception area and asked for an update on the table. I was then told by the receptionist that because I JUST arrived (keep in mind I arrived 4 minutes ago and my friend arrived at 2:15 pm) and because there are no available tables to seat my friend and I , we would have to wait an hour after being told less than five minutes ago that a table was being prepared for us. The attitudes of the two receptionist was EXTREMELY DSIGUSTING and very unprofessional. Having been lied on by them both, saying that I arrived more than 20 minutes late (which is false, I arrived at 2:12 pm) and then telling me I would have to wait an hour for an available table after telling me that one would be available \u201cshortly\u201d was very disappointing considering that I drove more than 30 minutes in the rain. While disputing our case with the receptionist, I received a notification via email that my reservation at La Vie has been canceled.  One thing to note: La Vie Brunch ends at 3:30pm, however when we arrived the manager said the kitchen actually stops serving food at 2:45 pm. Personally, I believe this should have been clearly stated on the La Vie website because had I seen that I definitely would not have made a reservation for 2:00pm.  La Vie in DC= Awful customer service. I and my friends and family will not be visiting this establishment ever again. I hope this review gives you some insight on whether to patronize this establishment.",

Seems like a waste of a salary to me. A friend of mine has been waiting to hear back from them regarding an event this month, and no one has bothered to return any messages. WHERE IS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY? He has visited the restaurant numerous times to speak to someone and no one seems to have any answers as to how to get in touch with the Event Coordinator. As you may have read from past reviews, there are serious customer service issues at this place. The manager and staff have been unhelpful. Who exactly is running this place?! As a former event manager, I simply cannot understand the lack in communication with potential clients. It\u2019s simply disrespectful of people\u2019s time and energy. There are so many other venues on the wharf that will gladly communicate and accommodate their patrons and clients without the stress and headache. If I were you, I\u2019d steer clear of this place for any special occasions. Where the is smoke, there is fire. Choose wisely.",

I tried to call at 154 to notify we were being late but hold time was too long. Finally we come up and receptionist downstairs tells \"better hurry up because they are doing last call at 245pm\". Check in with the hostess, she says the same thing then states your reservation was cancelled and she has to speak to manager (btw no notification of any cancelation via email). She says to have a seat to wait for the table..Finally we get to the table, the waitress was amazing and she is the only one that deserves any stars for this place! Too many people came up to the table to take orders that never made to the kitchen. My friend who came later asked for a vegetarian menu prior to 245 but somehow the order never was fulfilled then the chef refused to honor it..Security can use people skills and stop intimidating your guests who pay to be there. Being approached in such unprofessional manner to \"round up\" or \"leave\" is despicable for any place. First of all, decor dissapointing, flowers are not even real on the table..all plastic! when anyone makes a reservation they should be told right away about 245 kitchen closing.  Pros: food, the views, tapas style  Cons: plastic flowers, disorganized, rude security, portions (if table is for 5 people, don't bring 2 pieces of tartines)  Overall the vibe left from this places brunch was dissapointment! We aren't sure if we would be back for brunch, maybe dinner experience is much different and the reason for the good reviews...  Note to anyone placing reservation at 2, they will close all orders at 245. No valet parking here either.",

We had to keep asking for the drinks over and over. The server was disappearing and we had to ask other employees to look for him. The excuse for the delay was that they were backed up. Why don't have enough employees on the shift when you know that weekends are busy.  Food critiques: Drink I first wanted to try the  Green Juice Gimlet but they had run out of the fresh cucumber juice hence I couldn't have it. I then decided to get the Strawberry Letter 4.6 and guess what it was the same thing; not available. I just went for a glass of citron press\u00e9 because I told myself that they will not run out of lemons to make a lemonade. It was a regular lemonade with no flavor. It says to be house-made lavender lemonade but it was very bland.  Food: The beet Salad was appealing and delectable. It was my favorite. The steak Frites was palatable.  Desert: The Cotton-Candy Baked Alaska perfectly honeyed. I would recommend it to people that want a dessert that is not too sweet.",

My fianc\u00e9 and I, along with my mother, drove from Virginia to DC in rush hour traffic for a 5:30 appointment we\u2019d made with Cindy, the event coordinator for La Vie, regarding a tour of the restaurant and it\u2019s availability for a wedding venue in October. After some brief email correspondence, the only apparent point of contact in reaching anyone for information regarding events and booking, we\u2019d made an appointment and made it on time, despite traffic.  Instead of being greeted by Cindy, we were greeted by a young guy who seemed surprised at our mention of an appointment, and was clearly not expecting us. After several minutes of waiting and texting Cindy, he made things clear that she would not be joining, and would instead give us a tour of the restaurant himself. While he was friendly and certainly trying his best, he may not be best suited for running point on showcasing all La Vie has to offer.  The restaurant boasts several breath taking spaces, and even more beautiful views of Washington, most of the spaces were unavailable for booking, not due to availability, but because the restaurant keeps these spaces open only for business during hours of operation. This left us with only 2 spaces, which was a penthouse on the floor above the main restaurant, a small space currently being renovated or remodeled best suited for night time clubbing, and the two spaces within the restaurant proper, a green room with a king bar and large green booths or a space in the back which really didn\u2019t have a theme of any kind.  Countless pre-booked wedding venues have been cancelled this year due to the pandemic. So when restaurants become viable options for a small wedding, you would expect minimum effort of professionalism and courtesy. I\u2019m sorry to say this wasn\u2019t the case.  La Vie is a great night club and restaurant in DC. Just don\u2019t have your wedding or reception here.",

Some of our brunch food favorites include the smoked salmon tartine, avocado tartine, steak tartare, duck carbonara, salmon souvlaki, short rib hash, and the truffle fries. The tartines are a must try. The pastas were delicious as well. If you love fries definitely order the truffle fries. The truffle was so rich we had to order it twice. I noticed the proteins including the short rib, meatballs and steak were very tender and seasoned well. Views and ambience here are great. If you want a soft pink couch, views of the Potomac river or the long tunnel full of green decor this is your spot.  Service here was amazing! Our drinks and plates were constantly getting refilled/switched out. Food came out quickly and Covid mask rules were strictly enforced. The only reason why I'm giving this place a star off is because of the price. Brunch was around $70 including drinks, but once you add on the taxes, gratuity and 4% merchant processing fee each persons tab came out close to $100. We made sure to get our moneys worth, but it maybe best to wait till post Covid to dine here.",

Not to mention after paying 800. 00 for a tab, we were told our parking would be validated. Of course when we went to leave the parking garage we still had to pay an additional $28.00. I called the restaurant I spoke with someone by the name of Kaitlin, which she over spoke me, and didn\u2019t even care to hear what I was saying. Which is the staff should advise that the validation is only $10.00. Of course unbeknownst to us at the time. I asked her to speak to a manager. I was then greeted by someone who informed me she was not a manager but was NOT willing to provide me her name. She advised me the restaurant was busy and a manager was not available could she take a message. I informed the unknown representative that it was not ok and that I needed to speak with a manager. After asking for her name several times she indicated that she was NOT willing to provide the name. I have been on hold for 30minutes. I feel like she\u2019s only keeping me on hold so that i can hang up. During the pandemic you just want to engage in any thing close to normal activities. If this is normal, I\u2019m afraid I WILL NOT BE ENGAGING in any activities that this establishment has. Of course I will let my friend and family know. Who are all patrons. I will never visit the establishment again and I advise others to do the same. After begin on hold for 35 minutes I was hung up on. Of course I called back and was advised that all the managers were busy. If this is an upscale dining experience I find that hard to believe with the custom service I received. I spoke with the manager Mike, he was understanding and compassionate to the problem.",

But, the establishment itself is ran on biased with a sprinkle of race issue! Not only was my gf informed that the staff was constantly watching the cameras, the staff member also complained abt having to remind ppl to wear their masks. Which I\u2019m assuming in these times has become a regular thing for staff members in the service industry! Like where\u2019s the compassion!? And to top it off whatever \u201cboard\u201d the wharf has was also apparently upset ppl were walking up to the venue without masks. Now how the hell can someone control what ppl are doing before they even arrive to the establishment? Oh and let\u2019s discuss complaints abt music at 9:30 for an event not over til 10 and the noise ordinance runs until 12. These are all issues that are known prior to taking ppl\u2019s thousands of dollars and then offering them less than stellar customer service! I\u2019m sick of these establishments building their businesses in the middle of neighbors of color and then treating us like second class citizens! La Vie, do better with your service! Ppl are paying a pretty penny for your experience and these minor issues made into mountainous ones is unacceptable! Out of respect for my friend I won\u2019t take it to social media!",

Only issue was that my husband's lamb chops were over cooked and the restaurant was very adamant about fixing it and a manager came to even apologize for the mishap and they didn't charge us for it although my husband said it wasnt a big deal. But the fact that they went thru all of that tells me they care deeply about their customer service which will absolutely make me a repeat customer. My branzino was the best I'd ever had and the truffle butter made it that much better, the brocollini was also very delicious. Oh and my yellowtail crudo was soo yummy along with my Paris Brest. I'm very selective with my desserts  because I really want to be able to enjoy it and this was a perfect choice. Perfect amount of pistachios and cream. There was not one thing we didn't enjoy. We'll absolutely will be back for the brunch",

It was completely disorganized and took incredibly long to work your way up to order a drink. If you tried to enter another room security guards were blocking the doors only letting VIP guests in, therefor you were forced to stand in a hot room with no access to the outside. Clearly they have never hosted an event of this size as they were woefully unprepared to even fulfill the promise of a champagne toast at midnight. Would not recommend.",

The reason it\u2019s getting three stars is partially due to the waiter and the individuals around our table. We were never the bar at a table and were harassed almost all night by old creepy men by the bar near us. At one point, they proceeded to take unauthorized photos of us. To make matters worst, the waiter Jose (while \u201cnice\u201d) made us feel extremely uncomfortable. He met hovering and would not leave our table as we signed the checks and gave the tip. I\u2019ve never seen a waiter do this, it was intimidating and off-putting. It appeared maybe he thought we would dine and dash, which doesn\u2019t make sense apart from that we are all African-American. Even after my friend asked him if he could give us some time as my other friend calculated the tip, he refused to leave. It was almost aggressive.  The food And decor was the only saving factor of the evening.",

The decor is a mix of modern Art Deco & contemporary elegance & it's just beautifully done. Add to that the killer scenic backdrop you see outside the massive wall to wall windows & I don't know why you'd go anywhere else. There's also a large outdoor terrace with amazing views, day or night. The atmosphere works  for a business lunch, hanging with friends, date night or even dinner with your parents!!  I've been here for a birthday dinner, dessert & brunch & had a great experience each time. They accommodated our large party for dinner & seated us in the Chandelier Room (which you HAVE to see!) Service was attentive & on top of their game. The food was amazing. Everyone ordered something different (burgers, seafood, steaks) & all raved about theirs. *Spoiler alert: the brussel sprouts were AMAZING. I mean, if you can make brussel sprouts taste that good, you are winning at life! Drinks & dessert were great.  Brunch was also pretty good. It's not a massive spread of everything in the world, but diverse & quaintly done (which I loved). I tried just about everything & each food item was really flavorful. My absolute favorite was the Tiramisu French toast. OH. MY. GOD. I cannot say enough about it. Who knew? Oh, and the cauliflower. YUM. Dessert shots were also on point.  It's a great place & I will definitely be back with more friends & fam, if only for that French toast!! Yea, it's a little pricey, but so is every other upscale place in DC. I'd say if you're gonna pay, La Vie is definitely worth it!",

Traffic was horrendous, so we called to push it to 6:15, and they were very accommodating.  Like other businesses at the DC Wharf, if arriving by car your only parking option is the underground garage. Beware, it\u2019s pricey. I think it was about $30 for the 4 hours we were there, between dinner and show.  We parked near the stairs with the pretty waterfall wall and La Vie was right there on street level. It\u2019s on the second floor, so the outdoor hostess directed us to the elevator and instructed us to select floor 4.6. That is not a typo. (I found it very Harry Potter-esque)  La Vie can boast that there are some gorgeous views from their dining room and bar area. You can see the whole marina, promenade, fancy boats and yachts and a beautiful sunset if you are there at dinner hour. At night, it\u2019s equally stunning. Even the docks have little lights embedded in the boards!  We were seated right away along the windows. Most people were there after work in their work attire, and some were dressed up for special occasion. My friend and I were dressy casual in slacks because of the show we were seeing afterward, but we didn\u2019t feel too out of place. It is a gorgeous dining room, with that spectacular view, so I could see how this would be a great date night or special occasion venue.  Although our waiter was a bit detained, the manager came over and helped us get started with some cocktails. I had Le Paloma, which he warned had a smoky flavor from the mezcal (and he wasn\u2019t lying). I didn\u2019t mind the smoke, but didn\u2019t find the drink well-balanced against the sweet juices. My friend had the Crazy Pineapple, which was far better balanced and tasty (if you don\u2019t mind sweet). I ordered one myself since Le Paloma didn\u2019t suit me, but sadly they didn\u2019t take my first drink off the check despite it remaining 3/4 full on the table.  There is no bread basket or noshing type food while you wait for your meal, so if you arrive starving you better order an appetizer. Just a word to the wise.  We ordered the beet salad to share as an appetizer, and it was delicious. Multi-color beets, a yogurt based dressing drizzled over it, walnuts, and salad greens. And a great portion for two people as an appetizer. Recommend.  My friend ordered the pork ragu, which she said was very good. She ordered a side of roasted cauliflower au gratin, which I sampled. It was good, and had some mint leaves sprinkled on top for a unique flavor. It\u2019s a healthy portion for more than one person, so I would recommend sharing the side.  I had the steak and truffle frites with a bearnaise sauce. It almost looked like a puttanesca sauce with its orangey color, moreso than a traditional yellow bearnaise, but it had the classic tarragon flavor to it.  Sadly we had to run to our show so we skipped the coffee/dessert course (very unlike us!). Waiter was prompt with the check, and we made it to our show by 7:40 after our 6:15 seating. Not bad, timing wise.  Last tip: if you have leftovers to take home, be sure you put them in your car before going to The Anthem. My friend thought it would be ok since it was wrapped and placed in a nice handled paper bag, and we had actual seats for the show, but they told her she either had to coat check it ($5 fee), or toss it, as they don\u2019t allow outside food. So be sure to put it in your car before you arrive at the theater!",

Upon arriving we were seated at a lovely table for two by the window with a beautiful view of the Wharf. 20 minutes later, no water and never greeted by any server. Eventually a random person from the staff brought water and took our order for an appetizer. He seemed confused and said that he would find our server. The appetizer was delivered by kitchen staff and this person took our entree order and he also seemed confused to learn that we had no server. Our entrees were delivered and after an hour of being there, still no server. No server ever greeted us, talked about the menu, took drink orders, or checked on us until about halfway through our meal when a random server seemed to take interest and we ordered lavendar lemonades (delicious). This server engaged in a few seconds of awkward conversation and eventually brought the check. Strange....but the food was delicious! Not sure if I will dine here again.  UPDATE: Response to the owner, It happened this past Saturday, July 27th. 4:30 reservation. Thanks!",

I came in on a Saturday evening with a reservation, this place boasts a view but instead we were seated in another part of the restaurant with no windows and no view. I'm assuming this is the sports bar part.  That's ok, there is the food right? Hopefully that will make up for it. I look at the prices and I'm thinking ok these are fine dining prices, this will be delicious.  We start with the drinks and starting at $14 I order a Spritz Aperol -- 70% of this was ice. Ok, well i guess this is the Wharf but for a place named La Vie and at these prices I'd expect some garnishing or at least more of the drink I couldn't get at a local bar.  Moving on, we order appetizers and I ask to hold an order. Our server didn't hold it, it came out anyway. Ok, whatever onto the mains.  So I don't really write reviews often, but when I do it's because I'm disappointed AF and feel like a place is a rip off because it attempts to trick you into thinking it's something it is not.  La Vie is NOT fine dining.  I ordered the Steak Frites, the steak came out watery (likely defrosted) with NO flavor. I embarrassingly had to ask for more salt. I've never ordered a steak at any restaurant in DC and had to ask for salt. The fries had more flavor than the steak. I'll give them that they cooked it medium rare well, but bc of the temperature.i can tell that it was sous vide'd.  I don't finish the steak but tried a bite of the Lobster Squid Ink. The pasta is soggy. The Italian ancestors are rolling in their graves.  And the Duck Confit was a Frankenstein dish, just Google Duck Confit and compare it against my photo.  In summary, this place isn't fine dining, the chef unfortunately needs to question the work product. The staff is friendly and if you ask for the view ahead of time the ambience is great, but at these prices if you're here to eat, the joke is on you. Rip off.",

I notified the restaurant of the occasion when I made the reservation and requested a table by the window.  I also called the day of the reservation to put in the request.  When we arrived, although there were open tables by the window, the host refused to seat us at one, saying they were for other parties.  We only had three people in our party -- not big at all -- and I was astonished by their refusal to seat us by a window after my efforts to advise them of our request and the special occasion.  I can't recommend a restaurant like that to anyone.  A 70th birthday only happens once and La Vie nearly ruined it for us.",

While our first drink order came within a reasonable time, the second round took a lot longer to the point we had to ask if they were coming, only for me to received the wrong drink twice (I understand it was the bar and not the waitress). But our waitress also seemed awkward serving us, reaching across one of my friends to serve me and another friend from the opposite side of the table, then again trying to clear unnecessary item from one side of our table inside of walking around from the other side (our table was in the middle of the room and she had access from all sides). If La Vie was able to have a more polished wait staff then I would have given them 5 stars.",

The food was ok, but several dishes suffered from overseasoning/saucing, rendering the primary flavors moot.  The duck and the steak tartare were especially affected.  Our waitress seemed at best uninterested, never checking on our meal or asking about the numerous empty cocktail glasses.   The check did appear immediately upon dessert being served, so I guess she was paying some attention.  A second cup of coffee would have been nice, though.  And, annoyingly, when ordering four appetizers for a table of four, three of them came with only 3 portions.  I get not being able to scale to a table of six, but this seemed especially stingy given the prices.  La Vie seems to be yet another Waterfront restaurant content to coast on it's location.",

This restaurant is located on the Wharf which means great views as you're walking to it and even better views from the rooftop deck. The restaurant is beautiful.  Came here for a friend's birthday and was so excited to check it out! You have to take an elevator to get up to the restaurant.  We started with drinks and I ordered the rivera highball. This drink tasted pretty much like pink lemonade. I'm not sure there was much alcohol in it.  I ordered the salmon which was pretty standard. The salmon wasn't totally dry but it wasn't on par with other restaurants' salmon. My friends seemed to enjoy their other food, including the burger which was gigantic and very decadent! I was able to snag some of the fries and they were great.  We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and I was pretty underwhelmed.  The reason I'm giving this review three stars is for two reasons: 1) the food was okay but mainly because the service was all over the place. We had to wait like 10 minutes to get water in our glasses after the waiter came over to our table. Then another member of our party ordered her food a bit later than we did and she waited for at least 25 minutes for the food to come out. The waiter basically disappeared at this point and kept telling us the front part of the restaurant was slammed but I never saw him leave the kitchen area. At one point he and another waiter were socializing off to the side. So yeah. It seems like there are some kinks that need to be worked out here but I think there are lots of other options for dining on the Wharf these days.  Maybe it's a better spot for drinks and a view which seems like something this place would be nice for. It was far too expensive for the quality of dinner and service we received.",

Our waiter could talk in detail about every beer, wine & cocktail; and was happy to let us test multiple samples before making a decision.  The food was excellent; accessible, creative and done well. It's not the most gourmet I've ever had, but it's extremely dependable.  And the management were on the ball, checking to see how their diners were enjoying themselves, open to feedback, and welcoming.  La Vie could soooo easily be style over substance. But it's not. And the fact they deliver on substance means it's a completely solid bet for the range of experiences they're offering.",

I heard from a friend it got bad reviews and the plates were small but I'm glad I didnt listen to them! The atmosphere was great, and they even gave us 2 complimentary drinks when we got there because our table wasnt quite ready. We started off with the duck confit, then I had the pea risotto with crab and my husband had the pasta and clams. Side order of brussel sprouts. Everything tasted amazing! Had enough for left overs that that tasted even better the next day! Kind of pricey, around $115 total bill, but I dont suppose people are going here every night. Will be going back when my parents are in town !",

        "caption": "Let me just start by the only positive things that La Vie has to offer are the chic modern industrial design and the view.  Upon arrival, my girlfriend and I were greeted by a very nice friendly host who showed us to our table. Our server came by fairly quickly and took our drink order. Our cocktail took about 20 minutes to show up even though neither the restaurant nor the bar seemed very busy. Halfway through the time we were waiting for our drinks, the server came and took our food order, he never asked if we had any questions about the menu or if we had any food allergies( granted not required, but a sophisticated touch). We ordered oysters, grilled octopus, and a lamb appetizer in philo to start followed up with the gilled branzino filet. Another 20 minutes later the warm appetizers showed at the same time as the oysters. I couldn\u2019t comprehend how the raw food can be served at the same time as the hot one. At this point I\u2019m still giving the place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided not to let the food get cold and start with the lamb pie, which was very good and flavorful, and the grilled octopus, which was nothing to rave about. Halfway through the warm apps, not having touched the oysters yet, our entree was brought to the table. I asked another waitress to grab our server\u2019s attention, but she insisted that she can help with whatever we needed. I explained to her that we weren\u2019t done with our appetizers yet, and that our entree shouldn\u2019t have been brought to the table to get cold. She replied that the kitchen is closing soon, so they are pushing food out as fast as they can so they can leave, and she went to get a manager.   I was in complete awe of the explanation she tried to offer. The manager came to the table with a big attitude, and without addressing the issue, he proceeded to take the entree of the table and said he would hold it ( not have another one remade) until we\u2019re finished. Who wants to eat food that sat to dry up under a heat lamp for 20 to 30 min? Next we moved on to the oysters, 3 of which sat In a murky pool of water. As I moved to dump the water out, it turned out to be very slimy and mucus like substance. If that\u2019s not a sign of a bad oyster I don\u2019t know what is. I immediately pointed that out to the server and asked him to bring our check. He cleared our plates and sent the manager over once again. The manager offered no apologies, and told me that the chef tried the oysters that we sent back, there was no problem with them he added. He said that we didn\u2019t have a check since we didn\u2019t have a good experience. I told him that I would gladly pay for what we consumed and leave at tip for the server since the bad experience was of no fault of his, but more the fault of an incompetent kitchen and an incompr\u00e9hensive management. I can see why the Washington Post food critic gave them no stars.  I left a tip on table for the server, and will not be returning anytime soon. They also canceled my reservation  even though we were there, I guess they don\u2019t want me to post this review on open table.",

Because the day and time, the restaurant was turning into a lounge (which we did not know) and there was a doorman checking ids. He was fine we me. However, when my husband (a 6\u20193 black man) came to the door the doorman was not letting him in. He told my husband the restaurant/kitchen was closed (which was a lie because we made a 10:30pm reservation on Open Table). He also told my husband that there was a dress code (which was a lie because there was a white man sitting near our table wearing a tee-shirt and I believe jeans). It wasnt until my husband told the doorman that my wife is upstairs and we made a 10:30pm reservation that he let him in. It was so late and we were so excited about being out without the kids that we decided to stay and not let that moment ruin our time. However, I woke up the next day upset about what happened.  Once we were inside the food and service were fine (which is why I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1) but who wants their crab risotto with a side of racial profiling? Do better La Vie!",
