I'd say don't write this Domino's off, the managers and delivery people have always been very kind to me and I don't think the location is terrible or nothing but issues.

The pizza a lot of times arrives cold (I've often noticed the pizza tracker say that the order was quality checked, but then didn't go out for delivery until 20-25 minutes later, I'm assuming just sitting under a lamp waiting for a driver to arrive).  I'm always on the phone with them, seems like almost every order, telling them of what is wrong with the order.  They usually credit me or send out a missing item, which arrives 15 minutes after we've eaten everything already.  Only reason why I'm giving them 2-stars is that this doesn't happen all the time and they at least remedy the situation when something does come up.

There\u2019s never been an attempt to correct their mistake or even apologize. I\u2019ve even been LIED to about recieving a refund for an incorrect order. Yet on the corporate level, I\u2019ve reported and tried to reach out about all of these incidents and there\u2019s never been an ounce of effort made to make up for the wrong doings. It\u2019s sad to lose Domino\u2019s as one of my long-time favorite pizza places over the lack of effort customer service.

The pizza tracker said \"delivered\" (after I waited super long for it) and it wasn't ever delivered, so I called the store, they never even buzzed my intercom for me to get the pizza, then blamed it on the wrong phone number.  I HAVE A BUZZER!  The manager then rudely tells me, verbatim, \"Don't blame us for your mistake\".  WHAT???  NEVER again.  This is after me giving this place another chance after my last purchase, they CHANGED my tip amount to a larger tip (and I tip good as is), they claimed it was a mistake, but had I not coincidently looked at my card statement, I would have never noticed and they would have pocketed the difference.  Ridiculous.  Do NOT order from this place-rude, rude rude terrible service now.  I used to order from here often and the service was better, they must have changed management, if so, bad decision.",
