We were not allowed to enter or sit until an hour of waiting outside (with babies) and when we were seated, we were told we could not order because there was no chef on site.  It was a terrible, embarrassing situation for me and shameful for the restaurant. Despite multiple calls to confirm details with the owner, we were let down by the restaurant and forced to leave hungry and frustrated with no answers.  When I spoke to the owner the next day, he acknowledged the lapses, but provided no resolution or explanation other than blame his irresponsible staff. I do not recommend this place for any events you plan to have. They are unreliable and frankly, ruined my daughter's baptism day.",

Mixed greens and two slices of tomato. So I guess that\u2019s fine. The spaghetti wasn\u2019t spaghetti. It was a flat thin noodle more like a pad Thai noodle with marinara. The marinara/sauce itself was terrible. The meatballs were gray and tasted a week old. I ate the salad and after a few bites, threw the pasta in the trash. I am an equal opportunity eater, not at all picky. And while I understand every restaurant and every cook has a bad night, this was truly awful and warrants someone\u2019s attention.",

They serve several types of homemade pasta and about 7 types of sauces.. wish I\ufe0f could\u2019ve tried them all! My mom had a tortellini with spicy pomodoro sauce and my bf the Marsala veal with mozzarella and side of pasta. Both dishes beautiful cooked and just the right amount.

The service was downright offensive. The maitre d' / owner(?) was rude and condescending. He appeared at our table merely to countermand a suggestion by his own wait staff. (The staff, to their credit, repeatedly approached us to apologize.)  The food was deeply ordinarily. My son said that his chicken tasted liked french toast. Go figure.  But nothing compares to the service, or plumbs the depths as deeply, as what we experienced at this establishment.  All in all, a profoundly disappointing experience. As long time Heights residents, Caffe Buon Gusto exceeded all of our expectations and to a degree that before this evening I would not have thought possible. Not only did I leave the restaurant hungry, and disappointed by the food, but actually downright angry about having made the mistake of walking in the door.  Save your time, and your money, and stay away from this place!",
