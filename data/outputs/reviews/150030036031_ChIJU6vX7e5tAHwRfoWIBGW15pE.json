The place is nice and clean with cool pictures on the walls and lighting fixtures. It has a mezzanine and patio dining spaces. Both are nice, but I prefer the mezzanine because you get to see the whole restaurant. We ordered their three best sellers: crab benedict, prime rib loco moco and their most famous ube pancake. Boy oh boy, all were delicious!! The prime rib is cooked to perfection and the gravy complemented it very well. The crabcakes on the benedict are thick and so flavorful.

The eggs were perfectly poached, the crab cakes were a thick, generous size, with lots of crab (sometimes the veggies can overpower the crab, but these cakes were dominantly crab!), and they were on a purple ube piece of bread (English muffin consistency). So good, will 100% order again. My husband got a simple meal, the big breakfast combo with over easy eggs, and he was raving about how perfect his meal was as well. We got ube pancakes to share, and s\u2019mores waffles for the kids. The ube pancakes were amazing, I love the thick ube sauce ontop, just REALLY really good. Perfectly cooked. Highly recommend. For some reason we didn\u2019t like the s\u2019mores waffles. I\u2019m a huge s\u2019mores fan so I was sorely disappointed. They had marshmallow and chocolate and graham crumbles, it looked amazing, but man it tasted really weird. Nobody ate it. But that doesn\u2019t take away from our 5 star experience because the rest of the food was SO beyond delicious.  I do wish there were kids options. It\u2019s quite expensive to buy a whole big adult meal for picky kids that don\u2019t eat much. Felt like a waste of money for them.",

Prime Rib Loco Moco: I actually had low expectations for this one, but definitely liked this because I love food on the salty side and loco mocos I've had at other places had barely any flavor. The prime rib was delicious and not too overcooked, and the gravy was just how I like it.  Ube Pancake: this was so good! Definitely couldn't finish because the portions are pretty big, but couldn't resist having one more bite and then more bites even after I was full from the prime rib loco moco.  -0.5 star because the green tea latte was unbearably sweet. It's because they put white chocolate sauce in it. But if you have a sweet tooth, shouldn't be a problem.  I hope I can come again to try more items from their menu :)",

We sat down at a table of our choosing and placed our order. The food came out in a timely manner but when I took a bit into the fat pig fried rice the eggs was completely cold so I sent it back and had no appetite to eat the same dish.

I ate the rice because I was starving but the pork was so hard, dried and cold that I had to say something. They offered me 20% off a $17 dish but really should have just removed it. Basically paid $14 for rice.  Also the veggie breakfast burrito was very bland and also cold.  Service was slow for there only being a handful of people in the restaurant.

I think someone in the kitchen thought so too bc they snuck in extra scoops of icecream lol. The restaurant is very 'cute', nice atmosphere, but was dead, probably bc of their issues. Waitress was nice, but absent concidering some of the time we were only ones there, or 1 of 2 small tables. I had several times I needed something and was just looking around for someone and it took 5min to get assistance. Then at the end of service I had to wait about 10min with an antsy 4 yr old to get my bill, only to find out 18%gratuity was added on automatically without my consent for a party of 2. It's only supposed to be automatically added for parties 8+, and then the audacity to have had an additional tip line on the bottom! Insanity!! When I said something about it, she said omg and apologized, asking if I'd like it refunded, but saying it's gonna take 7-10 business days to get back on the card. Then they'd run ot again for the correct total. So 2 problems with that... I didn't have enough to cover our dinner out 2x, shouldn't have even gone out. We usually pack food to bring along, but I didn't get time. She had a Urologist appointment right there on beretania 2min away and she decided that's what sounded good and deserved a treat after the doctors(me not realizing horrible cost\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). We live on 2k/month right now(widow) in Waianae and had 1.5hr drive home thanks to dreadful traffic, I HAD to feed her before leaving for that traffic. I couldn't risk a scam of being charged that much 2x. Took too long, food was bland, overpriced, 'accidentally'\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd28 overcharge and automatic 18% gratuity from ppl... probably hoping A)they are wealthy enough to cover it... we're haole, so muuuust be rolling in money\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude44, no big deal, better to apologize, than ask permission \ud83e\udd2c, or B)hoping they're broke enough to fear a double charge until the first 'accidental' one clears and gets refunded\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44. Either way, shady, and freaking rude. Icing on the cake, asked to use the bathroom before leaving, got told to go upstairs and use it, bc the one down here is locked and I'd need a key... not, here, let me get that door for you, no?... or, here's the key...Wildly unprofessional and we shall not return.",

Yeah that's right. They stuck a whole prime rib in there and it was amazing. I really wanted to get the Ube pancakes but I was too full to even try. The color of them really intrigued me.

All those years ago, this place was the only one really hitting brunch on the nose with its fancy waffles, skillet dishes and pig fat fried rice. Surprisingly, I actually find that the quality is really great for the price you get. I got a skillet breakfast FULL of onions, bell peppers, tater tots, spam, portuguese sausage AND an egg on top-- and it was only $13?! I have no doubt that other places would have charged me $18. And the ube pancakes were amazing. Light, tasty, fluffy.. Amazing. That's why I'm pretty pleased with my experience here. Over the years it hasn't manipulated its prices or quality, which is good with these ever changing times.",

So we ordered that and also ordered the Kalbi plate, because I love Kalbi and one of the reviews on here stated that the Kalbi knocks it out of the park.  Our server was wonderful.  The food arrived quickly and those ube pancakes were truly eye candy!  The Kalbi not only looked mouth watering, but the aroma filled our table, and I was ready to dig in!  I took a bite of the Kalbi and it was beyond Ono (delicious)!!  Combined with the eggs and rice, I was in total bliss!  This was such a large portion, I did not think I would be able to finish it, but I ate every bite!  Bones only left on the plate!  (That review I read was 100% accurate!)  Now...about the Ube Pancakes, I took a few bites from my sister's plate and it is worthy of all the praise received.  The pancakes are so light and fluffy and the beautiful purple 'syrup' is not super sweet, it is just right with that nice ube flavor.   The coconut taste fused with the potato makes it a marriage that was meant to be!  I highly recommend this place.  I will definitely come back!  Please go.  You will not be disappointed!",

I know, it sounds ridiculous, waiting that long, but the wait isn\u2019t that long every day - don\u2019t go on a Sunday around noon - and the delectable brunch choices far and away substantiate the time you spend on the pleasant patio (sheltered, even, from that frequent morning drizzle).  Their take on the loco moco - a Hawaiian staple, for the uninitiated - satisfied my foodie wife, and for me, the s\u2019mores pancakes, admittedly a weird combination, were quite enjoyable, blending the sweet, fluffy marshmallow and melted chocolate with hearty pancake. As well, I chose the eggs benedict, not realizing how large the portions are, and yet again, Yogur Story hit just the right notes with that great American breakfast staple.  Good things come to those who wait, and Yogur Story is worth the time.",

My two-and-a-half-year-old son seem to like the purple pancake but it's not a surprise since it was pretty sweet.  My husband, my son and I shared three plates which ended up around 45 bucks.  Normal price for honolulu.  We order a cob the salad, which I forgot to take a picture of, and a egg Benedict with avocados which were pretty good.  It was a fun experience and staff were very kind too.  Prepared a high chair and small forks for my son.  But  if I was asked if I would come here again I probably would not.  But as a tourist, you can enjoy it as a one time fun event!  *My son might have a different opinion though lol",

This was hands down one of the best meals I've had on Oahu.  First things first: you're going to wait, that's just the nature of the beast. or is it? (more on that in a bit) When we walked up, we saw that the seats under the outside canopy were all taken by other guests waiting to have their names called. I walked in, jotted down my name and party size, and was told it'd be about 40 mins (ended up being slightly shorter - yay). Once my name was called, we were directed upstairs - not lead - and took our seats. The hostess was kind enough to let us store our bags near her station, which was appreciated.  Now, about that wait: I don't understand the necessity of keeping people waiting outside in the sun. During the entire time we brunched, I never saw anyone aside from restaurant staff at the close of business occupying the tables at one whole side of the upstairs area. Even the larger general floor area where we were seated maintained at least three to four empty tables. While it's possible that such is their system to not overwhelm the kitchen, I nevertheless feel that people would rather be told that the kitchen is a bit backed up whilst sitting cool inside rather than out in the heat.  About those ube pancakes: they are delicious; however, they also can prove to be a bit much. I mean, they are literally just drenched in the ube sauce, so unless you're all in for the full experience, I'd recommend ordering something savory with which to cut their sweetness, or else splitting them with someone else. It's a lot to take on just yourself.  My SO and I chose to pair the ube pancakes with the K-Town chicken & waffle, which was yet another excellent choice on her part. The chicken turned out to be boneless strips rather than wings, which suited us both just fine. The few bites of waffle drenched in Korean barbecue sauce were delightful; however, my SO did note that they were too salty for her tastes.  Our server was attentive without being intrusive/disruptive, which is evidently a much harder skill to master than you might imagine.  Note that there is but a single unisex bathroom on the second floor, and by the time I got around to using it, there were drying napkins spread nearly all across the floor. While that will most likely not be the case for everyone, I found the lack of attentiveness to the bathroom to be notable.  Overall, Yogur Story is undoubtedly a great choice for brunch in Honolulu; so much so, that I'm even tempted to return for what I saw of their dinner menu.  Should any of you ever learn the history of why it is named as it is, please do share!",
