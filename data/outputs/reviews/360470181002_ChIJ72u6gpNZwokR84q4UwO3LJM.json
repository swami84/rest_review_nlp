The place is really small. We were told they would be renovating soon. The first visit was ok as the menu featured entrees and two sides. I returned about two months later and the entire menu was changed. No longer could you choose an entree with sides, every thing excluding brunch items were a la-carte. I wish I had pictures as thr mac and cheese was burned and I wanted to send it back. My friend chicken was over done and I asked for the manager. I was thankful that I was offered another menu item and it was decent. I got the fried chicken wings. However after that experience I didn't feel welcomed. I probably won't eat here ever again. Too bad I had heard amazing things about this place and the chef was even featured on NBC or Good Morning America.",

Sadly, their front door policy is not well thought out, nor is it welcoming. On Sunday Brunch you\u2019re not allowed to walk in and put your name on a waiting list (which they don\u2019t have)unless your entire party is present. I was a party of three & my two other friends were doing the usual search for parking on South Beach & I was forced to stand outside for over 15 minutes, despite there was no wait, ample seats available (the restaurant opened 20 mins prior to my arrival) and more than enough space in the check-in area. The hostess was not overly welcoming, but she wasn\u2019t rude; however, the sign on the check-in desk was tactless, rude, and appalling! The sign limited your seating to an hour an 15 mins (they placed a wrist band on your wrist & wrote your time of arrival on it!!), discussed kicking you out if you couldn\u2019t hold your liquor, or if you threw up or behaved inappropriately, insisted that no one joined your table after you were seated & refused seating if your entire party wasn\u2019t present. After paying for the buffet & unlimited Mimosas your bill is approximately $50 & there is NOTHING on the buffet that\u2019s remotely worth that price. The eggs weren\u2019t real, most of the food was under seasoned or just salty. The mimosas weren\u2019t good. The owner was present the entire time I was there & never stopped by one table to smile, ask the customers how was the food or offer any service. Unfortunately, you would have to pay me to return to this spot. I\u2019m not sure how businesses are run in Brooklyn, but in Miami\u2026especially on South Beach he has to do MUCH better. In short, don\u2019t waste your time & your money.",

I watched the reality show and was curious to see the place in person. There isnt much parking nor a parking lot but its Ny so you cant really be mad about that. After securing parking we walked toward the building which looked abandoned. There were boards on the second floor windows and a door attached to the building was filled with what looked like balled up papers and boxes. The pink tea cup looked closed from the outside as the lighting is very low. I took a picture in from of the building and me and my family headed inside. There was no hostess so we had to wait for one of the two waitress to seat us. There wasn't too long of a wait just 5 minutes. I kept an eye out for Ana, Chef Lp or the twins and wasnt in luck. The only staff from the tv show on it was Thandi, who never treated anyone, asked if the food was ok or offered to take any pictures...surprisingly she refused. I'm sure it was because she looked a mess...hair not combed shoes was dirty and her clothes were I'll fitted...she just was having a bad day...no harm no foul. As far as the food....the shrimp was amazing and so was the collard greens. The fried chicken was cooked weird and appeared to be old as when you bit inside it was dark. The yams were cooked all the way and was hard. The max and cheese dosent count as a side so you have to pay $14 for that separate. When you order you get 1 meat and 1 side for the yeller amounts of $20+. The bathroom was dirty, the furniture was old, it was dark and everything you ate or drink out of was plastic. I'm not sure if they stage this restaurant for filming but it's not what you see on tv. There was no bartender and the drinks were weak. Our will was $140 + for 3 meals and 2 alcoholic drinks and 1 Sprite. They charge 18% gratuity why.....I dont know. I think for the price they should offer 1 meat and 2 sides which is what traditional soul food places offer. They need to pour some money into upgrades and much friendlier staff and better cooks. I guess chef lp has taken his talents to Miami leaving NY behind....I wouldnt revisit!",

I like my yams sweet and was to my liking.My girlfriend's ordered chicken wings, Mac and cheese,collard greens and corn bread. All said it was good and worth the trip. I was able to speak with Thandie and she was friendly and nice. She is my favorite on the show. She also took a picture with me. Thank you, appreciate at. Our experience was great.

No big sign- or any sign that I noticed in the window. 2. The prices...$25 chicken and waffle- no sides- the sides are $12.  That\u2019s $12 for some slices of cornbread. I got the Mac and cheese that was a cereal sized bowl of standard Golden Crust macaroni pie slice. Greens were pretty good. 3. Poor quality- Chicken, if you could find it under the mounds of greasy breading- was rubber. Every thing was either too greasy, too salty, or tasted like a mouthful of refined  sugar.  The plastic kiddie cup or either sweet tea, lemonade or half and half was $4.  I later noticed it was stored in those plastic tub containers with the spouts.  Again- just kind of like sugar water.  4. Ambiance - My husbands chair was broken and the place just felt grungy and sticky. When we got in the car the smell of old grease that clung to our clothes made us feel ill. Windows down driving home in the rain before I ended up leaving part of my meal behind in the gutter.  18% tip is included in your bill. I usually find this a fair practice as long as we get good service, but the food being so overpriced made me a little resentful.  I didn\u2019t complain or send anything back as it seems pointless to do so.  Judging by the tables around us we had a standard appearing meal. While we dined the small area stayed at least half full- I\u2019m not sure how.",

        "caption": "I went to the Pink Teacup on July 7, 2018. Traveled from VA by bus on a day trip mainly to go there to eat after watching the show. The place is small so I was glad no fighting broke out like they show on tv. The food was overly priced. I informed the waitress that we--myself and two others--had traveled from VA just to eat at Pink Teacup. I asked if we could get the brunch price since we had arrived at around 2:55 pm and it was over at 3pm. She never answered just stated we would get a bigger portion for the price of the dinner menu. I ordered the chicken and waffles---be warned they only serve boneless thighs BUT if you want wings you have to pay an additional $3.00. The sides were overly priced--i.e. $14 for a small portion of mac and cheese, $12 for small portion of collard greens, etc. Myself and my two fellow diners decided to each get a different side and would share. The chicken was presented nicely--golden brown and crispy. However, it was over seasoned with garlic. The waffles were very heavy. The $14 mac and cheese that I ordered was dry and you could tell it was from the prior day (or older) and scraped from the sides---anyone knowing about mac and cheese knows what I am talking about. It was not worth $14 at all---I did not eat it and took it to go and gave it to a homeless man. The collards were not fresh--I would say at least three days old and they were salty--they were also given to the homeless man. The sweet potatoes were excellent; you could taste every spice used in making them. The waitress started out friendly but when trying to decide which sides to order I asked questions i.e. is there pork in the collards, is the potato salad more mustard based or mayonnaise based--questions she did not know the answer to but should have---, she got a bit short with me and after bringing our food she did not come back to the table*. The bartender was overly friendly and came to the table at least three times to praise the food. Needless to say the bill was high but the worst part is the tip/gratuity is automatically added in the total bill so you can guess why the waitress wasn't attentive --she was going to get her tip either way. One last thing is the beverages, soda, tea, etc.---they are $4 and NO refills. The sweetened tea was delicious but served in a plastic type mug which, once ice is added you maybe got 1/2 cup of actual tea. We refused to pay another $4 for another mug. What I would say is : If you are interested in the show don't travel to NY just to eat at the Pink Teacup. Hopefully the Miami restaurant is much better. Oh, I almost forgot--the twins were not there. The only one from the show was Thandi and she did take a picture with me.",

They were out of the cornbread, which was a little disappointing, because, how do you run out of cornbread and its a soul food restaurant? I went because it was my niece's bday. It was a little pricey to me. You get a small portion of Mac and cheese for $11, it doesn't come as a side with a dish and the chicken with waffles plate was $25. However, aside from the negatives, the waiter bought the food out promptly and was very pleasant! We were a party of 15, and although it is small establishment, they were able to accommodate us on short notice. The owner personally thanked us for our patronage! I would go again.",

I love to support black businesses on the come up but the food was definitely not worth the money...the soul jumped out the food & walked up the street. Its New York so I dont mind paying money for good quality food, but was extremely disappointed. Especially when you charge $25 for just catfish & one side or catfish & waffles. The catfish was not cooked all way & the candied yams were overly candied. For $25 I of course expected way more.  Also ordered wings $12 for 3 wings.. they were big but when you bit into it, it was mainly breading & fatty. We informed our server about the wings & he tried to get us to order something else we declined.  He then told us that he spoke to his superiors & could not take them off the bill..we then spoke to the manager which was Thandi & she took it off no problem, I don't know what this waiter was talking about. We asked the couple that was leaving when we got there how was the food & the boyfriend said it was trash...he stated you see we left our food on the table and did not take any to go plates. Plus the music was not the type of music that you want to hear if you got your children with you. Do not open up one in Miami until you get this one in order 1st.  Love the show though!",

But I did not like it when we came back for dinner we were a party of five and another party of six came in 10 minutes after we did and they were seated before we were. I didn't like that it should be a first-come-first-serve basis being that they do not take reservations. But I will say that I was service was phenomenal the bartender very knowledgeable if only I can remember the waitress we had I actually gave her a sample of some things that we received at the curlfest a Prospect Park she was amazing. I will definitely be back. Oh by the way I had the catfish for dinner with the collard greens to die for I didn't take a picture of the catfish and collard greens unfortunately I forgot for brunch I had the chicken and waffles is great. I do wish they would put a salad on the menu fried foods should have a salad.",

I appreciated that they seasoned the collards with Turkey as I don't eat pork.  The restaurant is very small, so I understand why the menu is so limited.  With my food I ordered half tea half lemonade which was good.  I wanted to order one of the drinks (lemon pop) from the menu, but I asked the type of vodka that it is made with and the bartender said well vodka.  Sorry, I am not paying $14 for a mixed drink with well vodka.  That was the 1st con, the 2nd con was no splitting of checks under $200.  I'm not sure if this is common in NY, but all of the restaurants I visited so far, that has not been an issue.  So I ended up paying with my card, which was no problem, but you have to get up and go to the bar to sign on the pad.  This makes absolutely no sense, with all of this upgraded technology why would you inconvenience a patron to go and sign, when this should be done at the table? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  Lastly with the restaurant size, you would expect the manager to come around and make sure everyone's food is okay, but this was not done.  I am sure if you make improvements to the cons this would be a 5 star, but for now I'm giving you 3.",

My husband is from Georgia so he loves some southern/soul food. I definitely appreciate it myself.  However, this restaurant blew all expectations out of the water, the service was impeccable; our server was extremely friendly, she was engaging. And she had us cracking up throughout the meal. The food itself was delicious \u2013 specifically the catfish I ordered, it was tender, juicy, flaky and delicious. I usually hesitate  ordering catfish - because it\u2019s over cooked and rubbery... I\u2019m glad I ordered what I did this was certainly not a rubbery catfish. I would highly recommend this place \u2013 we can\u2019t wait to come back for brunch... over and over again!",

The yams are way to sweet, the mac and cheese extremely salty (if you have hypertension or diabetes stay away- you will die after the meal). I have neither but this was still way too much salt and sugar for me. Then they charge 11 bucks for a side of mac and cheese that is not included in any of the entree dishes which by the way are 25 bucks for basic southern dishes. On top of all of this they automatically charge a 18% gratuity. The bill came out to 87 bucks for two people for some very disappointing food. So upset I didn\u2019t follow my first thought to leave after the very limited over priced menu I saw. The catfish and collards were good, although the serving of catfish is only two small pieces. I WILL NOT BE BACK AND REGRET MY VISIT THERE. I have had way better soul food for a lot less. The service was average, it wasn\u2019t great or bad. Oh they make you get up and come to a card machine to pay your bill, for 18% gratuity that you automatically apply you should bring a receipt to me to sign. Oh and they dont give you cornbread, its on the menu as a side (it can be one of your two), what soul food place doesn\u2019t include cornbread!!!",

In 2018 most people dont walk around with abundance of cash. We called and were told there wasn't a wait. There was a wait. The greeter seemed not so pleasant and was a little unorganized as to where to seat us. Once we got seated our server was nice but unable to answer some of our menu questions on her own. They only serve pork bacon and sausage which was disappointing for some people in my party who wanted breakfast / brunch. We were allowed to order from both brunch and dinner menu. We ordered the catfish, chicken and waffles, porkchops, chicken wings, mac & cheese, collar greens, sweet potatoe fries, potato salad, corn bread. The waffles were the best, I thought the fried chicken was ok but we all agree we've had better. I liked the pork chop, someone else in my party didn't. The mac n cheese and potato salad were good. The catfish could have been seasoned more. I did not like the greens it has a lingering taste I didn't like and the corn bread was not was too sweet and cake like. Everyone agreed they've had better drinks. There isn't a dessert menu. The food was too expensive for so many inconsistencies. Gratuity (18%) is included. The space is small quaint, decor was dreary and needs updating. The vent was leaking on a customer beside us. Thandi who was recognized by someone in my group was walking around but not engaged with the customers. On our way out she was at the greeter station preoccupied with her phone. There was no have a nice day come back soon nothing no interaction. This establishment is overrated and overpriced. We've definitely had better soul food and service in NYC.",

The restaurant surprised me by it's roominess. Without a doubt this was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had. The service was excellent. One of the workers was so attentive to my kids even though she wasn't assigned to our table. Our server Shakira (sorry if I misspelled) was a professional and on point, checking to make sure we were happy.  My wife was star struck as soon as we walked in lol. There is a section reserved for photo-ops, which is cool. They make a fan feel appreciated and that's major. Everyone had such a lovely attitude. As for the food, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I had mac n cheese, cornbread and waffles. Everything I ordered was top-notch. My wife was loving the chicken and waffles.  I'm glad I read some of these reviews before visiting The Pink Teacup, I made sure to bring cash.  Don't believe what you see on TV, everybody in there is  so nice and down to Earth. Thandi is pretty on the show but she's even hotter in person. When we were leaving Dominic even came outside to say bye. The other woman who was playing with my kids came out too. (Wish I remembered her name, she was so sweet). I hope yall get the Michelin star one day, get bigger ratings and continue to be successful. Peace and thanks for showing so much love.",

The only familiar face I saw was Thandi. She was the hostess and had a pleasant demeanor. I didn\u2019t want to ask for Chef Lawrence Page, but that would of been nice to meet the owner. I mean like, why not?  I honestly had higher expectations of the establishment and those expectations derived from the fact that this restaurant is on national television. I guess that doesn\u2019t mean much these days. I expected it to be a little bit more polished and up-to-date. Nonetheless, the food was delicious. I have minor critiques about that part. The waffle was so light and buttery and the shrimp was amazing. Everything was well-seasoned, but the food could have been presented in a more aesthetically-pleasing manner. Our waitress was very sweet, but there\u2019s a disorderly, erratic vibe to the service. The overall dining experience was lackluster. It\u2019s disheartening when you go to eat at a southern-style restaurant and they\u2019re out of an item on the menu like cornbread. That was a huge disappointment. For an early Thursday evening, the place was full, but not overly crowded. Things to note: 18% gratuity is automatically included in the bill, this restaurant is CASH ONLY, and there\u2019s no desert. If you\u2019re ballin\u2019 on a budget, I wouldn\u2019t consider this place affordable. Be prepared to drop some coins.  There\u2019s other restaurants in the city where you can get more bang for your buck, but if you want to support a black-owned business and would like to enjoy some yummy, southern cuisine, this is a decent choice. I think it\u2019s worth going if you\u2019re familiar with the show and you want to see what the \u201chype\u201d is about. Otherwise, if The Pink Tea Cup was an airline, I wouldn\u2019t be a frequent flyer.",

Chicken was season-less, drinks had very little alcohol proof and the mac and cheese wasn't that great. Now i see the menu options has decreased now but the prices increased? Thats sad because its the original menus and style that brought people here in the 1st place and to change it like that i don't see this establishment lasting long. & P.S please allow people to have the option to use cash or credit..This place will never hit that popularity level..Greed gets you no where in life thats why he stay posting being with celebrities on his page but the celebrities never post him ...Smh",

And my drink was strawberry lemonade but, what was brought out to me were greens that I did not order, chicken wings that weren't fully cooked and that probably was because, the wings were too big, smaller wings would have been perfect, cornbread reminded me of eating a funnel cake/pancake and my drink tasted like a bag of sugar. The only food that was good was the mac & cheese and that should be included with the meal when selecting 2 sides not paying separately. I also had an issue, not being told, u can not pay with a credit card. Cash only. The waiter was no help with informing of that policy. 2018 credit card machine works better than an ATM machine by the door.  I'm saddened to say I will not be returning..",

The Drinks are over prices and more than 3/4 of the glass was Ice. Macaroni and Cheese was not included in the sides you get with main order. Who is just going to get a $11 Mac and Cheese on top of a 25 dollar main course? The restaurant itself is a bit dingy. And problem the worse for me is the mandatory 18% gratuity no matter the size of your party. The main courses were good I will give it that. If you are willing to overlook all of this go for it otherwise they are plenty of other southern style restaurants you can go that you don't have to deal with this.",

More importantly, the food was salty and I can't fathom why a chef would put some sort of smoked gouda cheese in classic macaroni and cheese. What is more, is the fact that the mac n cheese is an \"extra\" side.  That is, you cannot order it with one of the already overpriced $25.00 entr\u00e9e options.  Don't do that.  The only semi-veggie on the menu was overdone collard greens.  This is a far cry from the classic Pink Tea Cup that I remember.  The bar was sparsely stocked and a basic cocktail (with bottom shelf liquor) is $13.00.  A two-person meal with one drink each and seltzer water was $96.00 (oh because of course they added  gratuity to the bill as if you had a party of six).  I just felt like it was a bit much for an \"everything fried\" meal - gish, come to think of it, the cornbread was probably fried too.  Oh and one more thing, I know this place only recently opened up and so, I was baffled by the stale, 2014 restaurant certs and/or licenses on the wall behind the bar.  Notwithstanding all of that, I must say that the servers were very pleasant and everything is obviously pre-cooked, so the food came out lightening fast.  The nice servers are the only reason I gave two instead of one star.",

Instead of offering dinners they offer baskets which is a protein (shrimp, catfish, pork chop, etc.) and a side of sweet potato fries. I don't eat French fries so the fact that they don't substitute fries for a healthier option was really disappointing to me. My friend told me they used to have dinners and I wish that's what they still had. I had the catfish basket with a side of meatless collard greens. The basket was $20 had 1 piece of catfish cut in half. I left still kind of hungry because all I ate was the catfish and the greens.

The sides were delicious. (Collard greens, yams, & mac & cheese). Overall the food is very very expensive. A dinner for 2 cost us $125.00. Gratuity included at 18%. The place is okay but there's no food you may have seen on the show. Lastly when we requested ketchup they squirted a glob of it on a plate and brought it to us.

        "caption": "*Honest as I can be* I went to The Pink Tea Cup yesterday (6/25, Sunday) around 6pm. It was a little difficult finding a parking spot but I happen to find someone coming out of their spot around the corner so I had a short walk. There was four of us that went. We didn't have to wait in line. We were seated right away. It wasn't very busy so I'm assuming around 6pm would be a great time to go if you don't want to wait. We had Brianna as our waitress and she was very pleasant. She told us unfortunately they don't except debit cards so we could use the ATM in the front or go to the store across the street. So be prepared to have a good amount of cash on you if you don't want to pay the $2.00 ATM fee. My daughter ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. My mom- buttermilk fried chicken wings ($3 extra for just wings) with collard greens (made with pork) and potato salad. My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing as my mom but instead of potato salad we had the candied yams. We ordered Chef LP's Mac for the whole table since it's not served as a side but as an entree. All of us had the sweet tea (sweet but good). The food came out pretty much in no time. I was surprised at how fast our food came, I kinda was expecting it not to be so good. Honestly the food was REALLY good. The chicken wasn't dried. The candied yams were really candied yams. I had a small piece of my daughter's waffle and that was really good. I don't eat potato salad but my mom said it was really good (My mom is a picky person when it comes to food so if she said it was good and not just ok, then it was really good.). I didn't think the mac and cheese was going to be enough for four people but to my surprise it was. No one was able to eat all of their food. I'll be 100% honest, when the bill came I thought there was a mistake somewhere because it was pretty steep for my liking or it could be that I like to save money...I don't know but it was high for 5 entrees and four drinks. The tip was added into the bill but still it had my boyfriend and I like \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude27. The food was really good, our waitress was beyond nice. My boyfriend asked Brianna is someone's grandmother was back there in the kitchen cooking. She told us it was Big John/Jon. We told her to tell him it was really good. Next thing we know Chef Lawrence Page came out to thank us and took pictures with us. He was very nice. I would say I would go back again. I would have given The Pink Tea Cup 5 stars but they don't except debit cards and our bill was high for me and as high as it was no one walks around with that much money on them. Thank you Chef Lawrence and our waitress Brianna. Y'all made our experience a good one",
