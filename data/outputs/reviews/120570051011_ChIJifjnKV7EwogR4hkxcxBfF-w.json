We ordered cuban sandwiches,  empanadas and devil crabs. We were sold! I hired Michelle on the spot! The food was delicious!... To fast forward to the surprise party... Michelle and her staff were timely, courteous and efficient! Everything was perfect! The food, the service and the chef! Words cannot describe how pleased we were with Michelle Faedo and her staff. She and her staff are respectful, kind, considerate, helpful and friendly.

I ordered ahead they said 25 mins it took 40, granted they were busy. Upon looking at my reciept they charged me for the Cuban I asked for seperated charged separate. Even though when I called in this was not told to me. I had to lay 3 extra dollars because my children wanted to feel like they had there own food. I find this ridiculous and if it was communicated to me properly I would if took it home and wrapped it seperate myself. Very disappointed I know if the owner was there he would not have done this to me and would have communicated if he had to. Very disappointed never going back.",

        "caption": "This is one of those reviews where I really wanted to see this restaurant have massive success.  There are just so many \"holes in the bucket\" that I don't think they'll be able to patch them all to succeed.  Let me start by how the restaurant looks from the outside.  If you were just walking or driving by, you may not know there's a restaurant inside.  The front windows and door have a huge screen banner with an image of downtown Tampa.  It's confusing.  Then when you walk in (and we've witnessed this with 2 visits and multiple guests), you don't know where to go to place your order.  A simple \"Place Your Order Here\" sign would solve this problem.  So the first question you have when you walk in is \"where do I go?\"  Then (and in both visits) the person who took our orders wouldn't look at us.  She didn't ask if she could help us or ask if we had any questions.  No eye contact means no engagement.  To me it means that I'm an inconvenience or interrupting.  This happened on both visits - 2 different employees.  On our first visit I had a cheese-steak.  It was awesome and HUGE.  My wife had the Cuban sandwich.  Meh...  I thought it was thin on ingredients - especially considering the price.  On our next visit, wifey had the nutty bird sandwich.  It had a weird sweet flavor.  She said average.  I agree.  I had the roast beef Marsala.  After the raving reviews, I had high hopes.  I was quickly disappointed.  Again, like the Cuban, it was thin.  The roast beef - very low quality / cheap roast beef.  Someone said the Marsala was like Carrabba's Marsala sauce.  I've loved Carrabba's Marsala sauce for years.  Faedos Marsala is not even close to the quality of Carrabba's.  I asked my wife if she'd consider coming back again.  She hesitated and said yes, but only if other places in the area were closed.  Me - I'd give that cheese-steak another go, but just to see if they're consistent.  One more thing - while we were there, a guy walked in with his sandwich in a bag.  He looked upset. We didn't hear what he said at the register, but he demanded a refund.  We weren't surprised.  Another guest walked in, viewed the menu, uttered something about \"ridiculous prices\" and walked right back out.  Based on our 2 experiences, encountering less-than-enthusiastic, engaging or cheerful / helpful employees, I'm giving this place less than a 50% chance of survival.  They need some serious resuscitation, and for the prices they're charging, they should go take some lessons from Wright's Gourmet.  If they're going to sell sandwiches and salads at Wright's prices, then they should learn how to do it right.  Success and QUALITY leaves clues.  In closing, we are huge proponents of locally-owned businesses.  WE WANT FAEDO'S TO SUCCEED and wish them the best!  Time will tell...",

The staff didn't greet us or smile once then didn't understand our order even though we told her 3 times. Devil crab was just ok. Too soggy though. And for $9 it should have been MUCH bigger. The empanadas were also VERY tiny compared to other places and they were not fresh, I could tell they were sitting in the warmer for a long time. We really wanted to love this place but the prices for quality didn't let that happen unfortunately. Needless to say we won't be back.",
