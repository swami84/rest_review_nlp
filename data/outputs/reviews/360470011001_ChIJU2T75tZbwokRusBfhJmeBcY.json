It's sad to see a lot of places on fulton mall not reopen yet, so I am happy these guys are back. I had my usual lunch special - pretzel, pretzel dog and a soda. It came up to less than $5. So that's always good. A lot of places have been increasing their prices to try to catch up, but these guys didn't. Pretzel was perfect and pretzel dog was nice and hot.",

They are in one of the busiest areas on all of new york city located by jay street and fulton street in downtown brooklyn. I work around the corner and I have tried to go in there 6 different times since they opened and only once did they actually have pretzels. They make one tray at a time which is only like 6 pretzels and tgey sell out in 2 minutes and dont make more  until you ask them to. So they either tell you that there will be a 10 minute wait if you want some or sometimes they just tell you theyre out and dont offer to make any because they dont want to have to make any. I feel bad for the owner because he has no idea how much money he is losing out on. People are constantly going in and leaving because they are out. Its absolutely ridiculous.",
