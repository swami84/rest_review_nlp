The patty was probably a frozen patty and the topping were okay but the mushrooms seemed canned. The sesame seed bun was nice. The onion rings also tasted like Burger King. If I wanted a good burger I'd just go to Williamsburg and get some Shake Shack. Glad I didn't pay for delivering cause it definitely wouldn't be worth the price. I'm giving it one star though because the owner keeps writing angry responses to people's honest reviews. Definitely won't be going again.  To Owner: LMAO. No one needs to pay me to tell the truth.

There are 3 tables with two chairs each, and in the patio I think there are 2 other double tables, on the opposite side they have a bench. The lady who attends is very kind. They have a variety of burgers, and shakes, and as I said before the prices a little bit $ up, but the size of the portions is super worth.  (Original) Me lleve una grata sorpresa de como en  un lugar muy peque\u00f1o , y relativamente econ\u00f3mico, pueden preparar cosas muy ricas . Son 3 mesitas con dos sillas cada una , y en el patio creo hay otras 2 mesas dobles, en la parte de enfrente tienen una banca . La se\u00f1ora que atiende es muy amable. Tienen gran variedad de hamburguesas,  y shakes, y como dije antes los precios un poquito $ arriba, pero el tama\u00f1o de las porciones lo super vale.",
