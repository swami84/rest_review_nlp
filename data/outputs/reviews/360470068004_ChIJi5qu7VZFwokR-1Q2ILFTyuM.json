There are heated lamps above each table as well. Overall, we were very comfortable and warm. We started off with chips & guac: 10/10. the portion was massive and the sweet sauce they give you on the side tastes so good mixed with the guac. I got the enchiladas and my friend got steak, everything was so delicious. In total we must have had 5 margaritas each, they were so delicious and we came at happy hour which was a plus :) overall this place is a great option if you\u2019re looking for comfortable outdoor dining in nyc as well as delicious mexican food & drinks.",

One main negative though was how small of a serving their  margarita was (see pic) - they say it\u2019s the same ounces but there\u2019s a lot of ice in it so it wasn\u2019t worth it.",

When I went to pick up the order, the elote and the cake were both missing from the order which I luckily spotted and was able to get them before I left. I was immediately turned off that half of my order was missing but once I got home and tried the food my entire opinion was reversed. Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! The corn tortillas used for the baja shrimp tacos were clearly homemade, the shrimp were plentiful. The elotes was well seasoned and had plenty of cotija cheese. The chocolate hazelnut tres leches was an absolutely triumph, probably the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. I will be a repeat customer for sure. Do yourself a favor and definitely get the chocolate hazelnut tres leches.",

And when we disputed the hidden fees, the restaurant owners were condescending to the party and belittled people because of their ethnicity and social class.
