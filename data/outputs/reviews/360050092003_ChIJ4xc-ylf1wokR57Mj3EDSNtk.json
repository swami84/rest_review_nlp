I buy in Manhattan from Vegan places often and I know it's expensive but, I at least get more food for the same prices. Almost $10 for wings and when I opened the tin, there were only 4 wings with sauce over it?! I expected more.  My simple instructions for my burger weren't followed and the blue cheese, which comes with my wings, was also missing from my order.  The best part of my entire meal was the Milk Shake. Not sure if I want to try again but I was underwhelmed for my first try.",

Soon that person was on the phone I said hello he said \u201cyea what happened\u201d in a nasty tone I said well I was explaining you guys forgot a part of my order, he cut me off started yelling about what he forgot then said well driver is going now then hung up on me.  The food was absolutely great so despite the service and two hour wait we ordered again another time two weeks later. We were worried about the service but instead the food came on time and it was something different I was so disappointed. I ordered the exact same chicken sandwich from last time instead they put three chicken fingers and thought this was the same. Or maybe a person wouldn\u2019t notice? I couldn\u2019t get in touch with them and refused to show up at the place given the past service. The most consistent thing I hear is how nasty they treat people on the phone. If there was no more chicken sandwiches available I should have received a call to change my order honestly.",

The deli is usually open 24hrs but will close around 4am for cleaning.... finally vegan options late night AND in the BX!!  The chopped cheese was the winner (without beyond meat). It was full of flavor and absolutely delicious. The beyond burger was also good, you can never go wrong with that. The quesadilla was also good but could\u2019ve had more vegan cheese. Overall, I recommend and will definitely be going back to support this movement.",
