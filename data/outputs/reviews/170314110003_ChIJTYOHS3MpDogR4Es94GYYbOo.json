The soup was a fresh and delicious vegetable soup, filled with broccoli, snow peas, bean sprouts, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, etc. Filled me up and had a deep, rich broth! Egg roll is one of the very few that I have had that were freshly made and without an awful aftertaste from using vegetables refrigerated for too long or too close to their expiry date. I chose the basil tofu for my entree and the tofu was lightly fried but still firm and had lots of veggies and sauce to go along with the rice. Run by blunt, but still very nice women! I definitely WILL be coming back.",

I placed my order online, *at no time was I prompted on their website that there were delivery location restrictions-in fact my delivery fee increased once I typed in the address. Also, I order from Hyde Park resturants frequently without any issue. Immediately after I placed my order I recieved a phone call from the restaurant. And the man very rudly asked me where was my street located. He then went on to say that he had never heard of my street name and he's lived in Hyde Park for 30 years. He only delivers locally in Hyde Park. So I said, okay can you refund my delivery fee and then he tells me \"you have to call the website. okay? Okay goodbye\"  While I was able to initation a refund with relative ease from the company they use to order online, the way the man handled the entire situation was very rude. I would have even been willing to pick my order up had the service I recieved been better.",

The food took two hours and ten minutes to arrive and the person on the phone was unhelpful, rude and generally incompetent.  I ordered delivery at 19:45 on a blustery Saturday night, about a mile away. The person on the phone didn't tell me how long the food would be and I neglected to ask, which I realized as the call disconnected. Didn't call back to ask as I figured it wasn't a big deal.  An hour and ten minutes later I called the restaurant back. The guy said the food was on its way. I asked how long it might be and he said that the driver was laden down with orders, and after asking for an estimate (we were hungry!) he said he'd ask the driver and call me back.  Ten minutes later I call the restaurant back (1:20 after initial order) and the guy tells me that I should have ordered pickup instead. After explaining that information would have been helpful as I placed the order he starts lecturing me about the weather, how the night was busy and that they only had two drivers on that night who currently had 5 or 7 orders each. At the end of this he says, \"so sorry, OK?\", repeating this as if to shoo me off the phone.  Two hours and ten minutes later (50 minutes after last contact with the restaurant, with the last estimate being \"maybe 20 minutes\") the driver calls me to indicate he's almost there. I inform him that we're no longer interested in the food. He replies \"Oh, OK, cool\" and hangs up the phone.  This was my first and last experience with Siam Thai Cuisine. They seem uninterested in my business.",

But, I waited a additional 35mins for my Entree to be serviced; as I watched people who arrived 20 mins later than I being served their Entrees before mine. I quietly said nothing, but resigned to not eat there again. Even something as small as my not receiving a \"fortune cookie\" at the end of my meal (as I observed them being given generously to other patrons) just annoyed me even more. I'm not certain what the reason may have been concerning these oversights, but it was disappointing to experience. Again I say; it's quite unfortunate that I had such bad service, because the food was very good.",
