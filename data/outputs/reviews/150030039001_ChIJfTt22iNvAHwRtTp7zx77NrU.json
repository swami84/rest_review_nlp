From the ABSOLUTELY STUNNING restaurant design and ambiance to delicious cocktails our night turned into a memorable experience! Food was delicious - A culinary adventure!

To be perfectly honest I coudent taste any of the core elements in south East Asian cuisine: chili, fish sauce, or lime.  Even in the dishes which claimed to have those exact ingredients.  Maybe the kitchen isn\u2019t tasting the food before it\u2019s being served, or possibly they have been directed to tone everything down?  Either way, if I wanted food without those flavors I\u2019d just eat at an American restaurant.  Also, the fact that there are two restaurants in one space, owned by the same people, serving similar cuisine but have two separate menus is highly confusing.  Just put the food on the same menu!  In good news the tapioca dessert was fantastic.  Just fix the food and you would have a great spot!",

This is a violation of the Hawaii Smoke Free Environment Law, but the owners and management defend it by saying that they are \u201c25 feet from the entrance\u201d. The issue is, they allow the smoking in the outdoor restaurant dining area - which is a violation. TERRIBLE smell and cigar/cigarette smoke flows through your table and food as you enjoy a pricey meal. This place needs corrected by the Health Department before we will ever return.
