Habanero sauce was incredibly flavorful but not overly spicy and had enough balance to where someone with a low spice tolerance would still probably like it.  Overall 10/10 will definitely be back.",

I ate some of the mole straight wrapped up in a tortilla and enjoyed that decision as well. The carne asada was tender and juicy, and the guacomole fresh and tasty.

        "caption": "Ms. Mole's is a hidden gem on Northside of Chicago! Had an excellent dinner there tonight. The food was wonderful, but also beautiful! We started with Guacamole and Ceviche, both were amazing. We had a party of 5 people, we were able to sit outside and social distance comfortably. The restaurant took every precaution to make sure everything was served with our safety and comfort in mind. Each person in our party ordered something different. Each plate had different elements of flavors that went so well together. We had the Arroz a la Tumbada, Callos de Hacha en Pipi\u00e1n, Special Thursday Mole with Duck, Enchiladas Vegetarianas, and Atun a La Mexicana. For dessert, we each had an item and again, each dish had such flavorful elements. I think my ultimate favorites were the Chocolate Tamale and the Churros. Thank you, Chef Gino Bahena and Branko for making our evening wonderful! We definitely plan on going back soon. I\u2019m also hoping to take a Taste of Mexico cooking class with Chef Gino sometime soon.",

We were blown away by the flavors in each dish that were so unique and clearly made with love and care. The waiter, Jose, was friendly and knowledgeable yet gave us space on our date night and it was nice that the chef stopped by to chat and share his experiences. We hope that he is able to publish his cookbook so that we can try to replicate at home. Until then we are going to look into the cooking classes to take our friends for an adventure. Try Mis Moles, recommend the tasting menu with wine, but from looking around there didn\u2019t seem to be a disappointed table. Great outside seating and plenty of free street parking. What a gem.",
