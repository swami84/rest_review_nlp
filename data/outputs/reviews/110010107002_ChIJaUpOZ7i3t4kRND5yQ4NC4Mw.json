The girlfriend returned and in a threatening tone started shouting at the owner with her mask lowered, the well witted owner and employees then proceeded to efficiently remove the gaudy half maskers. 10 out of 5 stars.

The family who runs this joint is super friendly and attentive (and were recently featured on DD&D!) and so obviously put a lot of love into their restaurant. They do have a few vegetarian and vegan options, and in particular I thought the South Philly Ratatouille sandwich was perfectly made -- try switching the provolone cheese for smokes gouda for a deeper taste. They're famous for their Philly cheesesteak which is inspired by their home town, but honestly you won't get a bad meal no matter what you get. I definitely recommend getting something from their pickled menu to really cap off your meal!  Also: the half sandwiches at $10 are PLENTY of food on their own. Don't let the name fool you.",

Classic breakfast hoagie (2 eggs, a meat typically bacon, cheese, leafy greens and tomato, on a roll) and Roasted Potatoes. Tastes were on point and quality, just like their normal sandwiches. They offer the 'Breakfast for Lunch' Sandwich all day.  Also tried their Oatmeal Walnut Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Sandwich. A good amount of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between 2 large cookies. Nicely wrapped in plastic for to-go options.  _____________  My favorite in DC proper. Philly native and appreciate the quality and rich flavors presented in each of their sammies and other items sold (owned by ex-Philly residents, like myself). And Chef Jonathan Taub has nice formal restaurant credentials, and is now supporting the family business.  Beer and a mixed soft drinks (and water, ask for a cup) complement well. (At the time of this writing) Prices typically range $10ish for large 1/2 sandwich and $18ish for a whole, for breakfast sandwich is around $5. Space is underground a few steps and not fancy at all (but clean). Loyalty punchcard offered too. Give this place a try, methinks you'll really enjoy it. Excellent cold and hot sandwiches with optional condiments (sweet and hot peppers, a 'spicy hoagie spread', horseradish, etc), very good bread and higher-end ingredient quality.  ----- (Update): they serve mostly the breakfast to lunch crowd. Currently M-F 8 to 4pm, and Sat 11am to 4pm.  They do occasionally run a unique Saturday night price fixed dinner, branded \"Supper at Bubs\". Multi course, prix fixe menu with wine, liquor and additional beverage pairings. Checkout their website to learn more, and to see when they may be running their next event.",

There was some stress around cash vs credit card; clearly the weight of the finances weigh heavy.  But every customer was greeted with smiles.  It seems they are used to long lines, so they try to limit customization - which is fine.  Then menu is big enough that people can find something.  The cheesesteak was vast and bountiful; delicious.  The Italian subs were great.  Everything I saw go by looked wonderful, all the slaws and such.  The lychee Italian ice (water ice) was very tasty.  I tried the various relishes and peppers - tasty.  We had a modest group and got the larger central table - for a lengthy group discussion.  Never too noisy, no hurrying us out.  Overall, a really great atmosphere and excellent food; of a quality that I would be proud to find at other sub shops in NY, Phili, New Haven, or Providence.",

Here's why:  1) Food: Despite the quirky atmosphere, the food is what stands out first. They make a variety of items, but their sandwiches are what they are known for. The Italian hoagie and beef steak are top sellers and come in full and half portions. The half was enough for me to feel content!  2) Atmosphere: With quirky knick knacks on the walls and photos of their most loyal fans, this place is loveable. It feels like home. They also have a photo of Guy Fieri since he highlighted them on his show, but the photos of the customers are centerfold. They care that much about their fans over celebrities.  3) Service: The owners are so kind and will make you feel like you've known them for years even if it's the first visit.  If you are in Dupont Circle, stop by this place. It's a DC classic and one of the most loved places in the city.",

Me, the lover of Sando Shops across the country...me, the self-proclaimed SandoKing, had failed, in my 13 years of living here, to make my way to Bub and Pop\u2019s.  This place is what a Sando Shop is supposed to be!  Had a Tuna Melt (pictured) and also got an Italian to-go.  Both were equally delicious in their own right, both had me slightly angered that this wasn\u2019t my 50th time having them after being here for most of my adult life.  Bub and Pop\u2019s is an institution in DC, a must visit, a place where you\u2019ll always feel welcome, and, of course, always have an amazing Sando.  They do it right!",

I own a restaurant and I love that the owner was at the register and her son is the chef! We ordered two cheesesteaks that were both very good. My son ordered the Bolognese which was obviously homemade red sauce with Italian sausage and homemade meatballs, very very good. I ordered a chicken Parmesan and it was excellent! Same homemade red sauce and a big piece of chicken. Bread was very good, being from Louisiana we always have French Bread and this was more sub/hoagie style and we loved it. Servings are very large and the place is very warm and welcoming. Not a big place, but we went at an off peak time and it was only about 1/4 full. Food came out very quickly and they had very cold beer! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves good sandwiches, they have good options and if I ever make it back I will definitely be trying the Hebrew Hammer, it sounded excellent as well!",

I got the iconic italian hoagie, and overall the quality was okay. The only gripe I would have is that the store is only open 5 hours a day, and that the sandwiches are hugely overpriced. For a place that was my first visit when I moved to DC, I can say now that having visited other sub shops that Bub and Pop's only has a lasting appeal for tourists. ~$20 for a sandwich...that's a pretty crazy price to be paying for something that is not a full meal.",

There were 4 of us and between us we tried and loved the tuna melt sandwich, philly cheesesteak (amazing), jewish deli was piled high with corned beef, brisket, turkey as well was the italian hoagie and the brisket with fried egg.  Everything was wonderful.  The owner was there to help close and I stopped to thank her and her staff.  She couldnt have been kinder or more friendly.  We will def be back.",
