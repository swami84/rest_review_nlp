She was nice and told my party to follow her. The place is packed. After eating all the good food the check arrives. It was only three of us. They would not separate the check. Our check was over $200. Party of six or more and check over $200 you will pay 18% gratuity. Didn't like that part. Didn't make a fuss. Other than that. I had a good time with my friends.

Mozzarella sticks were frozen in the middle but the whole fried fish was tasty. This fried lobster tail picture was way better than it actually tasted. For all the antics there\u2019s way better food around Atl without all the nonsense and inconsistencies in quality. May be fun for a younger crowd just wanting to be seen but I won\u2019t be back.",

This is after asking the hostess about the wait and her getting smart stating that she didn't know what was taking so long because she was standing up front with me.  There is no organization and everyone that comes in is given the same wait time.  Reserved tables and times should be held for customers who make reservations and not just given to people who freely come in. After being seated we tried to order drinks they didn't have any frozen drinks, as stated by the waiter. She asked did we want appetizers and when we ordered she came back to tell us the fryers weren't working at the time.  The food was great but service is horrible along with parking.  She made us pay on one check to get her 18% gratuity because that made the check over $200. When we told her it was separate checks she stated that her system would not allow her to seperate the paymenrs. Overall good food but horrible service. Will never go again.",

Our reservation was at 7:30, but we weren\u2019t seated for over an hour plus(due to VIPs came in this is what we were told).The seafood did have good flavor and awesome size shrimp. However the potatoes were hard and the corn was overcooked. The 5 patron silver flight style drinks were 80, don\u2019t order, flavor just okay. When asked if you want a bottle water say no. It Fiji Water and it\u2019s 5.00 a bottle. The server Krista C did check on us frequently, but came and left very quickly. The restaurant was packed. Parking was horrible due to wait time for valet and the limited amount of space for parking.There are other restaurants that can provide what this restaurant provides if not more. I think people come here to be seen and because celebrity have complimented this location.I guarantee when you are well known and people know you have money they treat you differently. A manager never apologized for our wait and didn\u2019t ask about our food . We had a party of 6 and spent easily over five hundred dollars. If it wasn\u2019t my daughter\u2019s birthday, we would have left.",

Upon entering, I was shocked to see masks not being enforced and people jammed into spaces without any social distancing observed. I really didn't noticed until we were seated.  Our waitress Krista C was awful! She was not friendly, offered fast service to us where we couldn't get a question in quick enough. She debated with another waitress about her tables in front of us. The appetizer came after our entree. The over-seasoned medium sauce requested appeared to be HOT at best. I found no meat in my crab legs as I cracked them. I'd never seen this before. My boil bag was missing the 1/2 lb. of sausage and wasn't given until leaving. Krista C slammed the rolled bag of sausage on our table plain with no seasoning. I left it there purposely! The drinks were not refilled, water wasn't asked or offered, and the bill was $197 for 2 people.  After asking to view the contactless wrist machine, it showed that Krista C automatically included 18% gratuity for 2 people. It wasn't until we left that we discovered that she said we were a party of 6 to justify her entering our tip herself. After asking for our receipt 3 times, I also spoke with a manager who said to me he believes I'm telling the truth because he's received these complaints about her before. However, I could tell he wasn't or have never made any corrective measures since Krista C still does the same while getting fraudulent tip rewards! Because I tip 20% and more, she cheated herself. If asked would I return, I'd say not at this time compared to Pariot's Boil and Juicy Crab with better service at cheaper price for the same food.",

Menu online is not accurate with what we were billed.  We were a party of 3 with separate bills and our receipt  reflected a party of 6 which automatically prompted their system to charge us a 18% gratuity.  This information is not listed on the receipt nor is it on the website.  The website mentions an automatic gratuity for a bill larger than $200; however our bills were split.  We were completely blindsided. This is not a tasteful way to run a business. I don\u2019t recommend this place at all. They are taking advantage of people.  I didn\u2019t even mention the food.  Very salty!!!  I will say the server circled back around and apologized! We appreciated that. Because of that, we gave an additional tip.  However, management should do reevaluating when it comes to their  policies and procedures",

I can honestly say, the portions, flavor and pricing were on point! The vibe there is amazing..loved the music and decor. My waitress however, not so much. Not sure if she was new or if she just didn\u2019t care but I had to pretty much ask for things that were suppose to be provided just in basic server etiquette. We weren\u2019t given straws, my friend had to walk to the bar and grab them. After that we ordered an appetizer, she didn\u2019t give us silverware. Erica  suggested we try a specific sauce with our hush puppy appetizer but after bringing the food, she said they were out..ok, not her fault, but would of been nice to know before we placed our order. Or even once she found out they were out of the sauce. My friend asked for hot sauce and a refill on her drink, which took literally 10 mins for the sauce, then another 15 for the refill!!! I mean OMG! Needless to say, I am very understanding IF I can see a full house and tables filled from wall to wall, BUT that wasn\u2019t the case. She had our table of 2 and another table of 2 behind us. We could see her standing by the bar talking to the hostess..just doing nothing. We literally had to ask for refills on our waters EVERY TIME! At one point we had to grab another waiter after waiting on her for 20 more mins, to ask her to come over to us..which in that instance, she admitted she forgot to bring us out what we asked for. Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere, and the food, but due to the service from the waitress, it really dampened our whole experience.",

I had the cotton candy martini which was delicious. The downside is that they do not have parking, you must valet. Also must make a reservation if you plan on visiting during the weekend to guarantee your spot. Lastly, since we\u2019re in the midst of a pandemic I would have liked to be distance from other tables and guest. I think they should reconsider that rule!  Other than that.

The 1 issue I had with the establishment is that fountain drinks have no free refills and are $4 a cup. There was a small mix up of how much eggs corn and potatoes I was suppose to get in my bag but my server and manager Mike fixed the problem promptly. There is valet parking and they do ask for a tip being that is what they work off of. No big deal. Definitely would be a place to visit again if the vibe and consistency of food stays the same.",

Walking in I was greeted by the staff all the way until the time my family and I were seated. I am huge on customer service, that is a maker or breaker for me and my family before we even taste food at restaurants. The food was AMAZING from the appetizers ( sea food egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, salmon bites, and a few more) i had the opportunity to try the boil, the Alfredo, and a few other items my family ordered around the table. We can not forget the drinks !!! I can say I am very satisfied with the amount of liquor in the drinks. They are not watered down And poured very well. Others at the table ordered the fire crackers, martini flight and a few other. They we very pleased as well. I will most certainly visit this BLACK OWNED establishment every chance I get ! Thank you for the experience !!!",

My wife had the seafood egg rolls and the combo special.... food amazing, now the reason for the 4 stars is because of the way the manager Mike approached us. it was a bit uncomfortable as we watched him, what i observed was he seemed to be a bit inebriated or maybe off some kinda drug. he was pacing non stop and was just acting very strange i cant explain it but my wife and i was laughing amongst ourselves about it and the table next to us even noticed, other than that everything was great.",

I had fried lobster and the vegan boil (best vegetables I've ever had).  Those who dined with me had the fried salmon and crab boil.  They were just as pleased.

Me & my sis ordered the Candy Martini Flight and let me tell youuuu. Yess! They were strong & the presentation was perfect. Exactly what i needed. For food we got the fried salmon basket and Built our own boil bags. The salmon was soo good the seasoning was on point & they had remoulade sauce which is the bessst if you know anything about it. The boiled bag was served extra hot i got the snow crab, shrimp, mussels & eggs. Spice level Medium wasnt too spicy it was perfect for me. My boo got Hot & it was good for him imma baby lol so ill stick to Medium. But this place will be seeing me again very soon. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

The drinks were amazing!! And our waitress was super sweet.. well, why a 2 star rating? We ordered our meals, simple boils with potatoes, eggs and corn..a couple next to us that had been there when we got there got their meal shortly after we finished our drinks.... the couple finished their meals whilst a new table to the left of us was seated, less than 6 feet, no masks... we waited...we waited some more...and some more.. finally the server came and said our food is about to come out... after a bit more waiting our food finally came out.  Buy this point about 40 minutes passed and I saw ppl who came in after us get seated and had their food before us.  Long story short we told the server to put it in a to go bag dueb to the  discomfort of ppl with no regard to a mask policy that's clearly listed upon entering the facility and for waiting 40 min to pay 150 bucks for to go seafood.... great server..other than that........",

Also had crab cakes and calamari. My friend got the Boiler Special and that sauce...OMG! Juicy crab has nothing on that food. We got the Martini Flight, Fireworks and Mojito to drink and wow!!! Great presentation even better taste! I was thoroughly impressed and will be returning to try the rest of the menu and drinks.",
