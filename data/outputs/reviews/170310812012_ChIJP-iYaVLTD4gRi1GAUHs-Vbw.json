The scallops were perfectly cooked and paired well with the horseradish sauce. The lentils were a bit bland, but added a good balance.  The duck breast was incredibly tender, and the pistachio bits and warm pear slices were a great addition.  The sticky date pudding was not at all what I expected but so delectable. I was blown away with the first bite!  Although the prices seem a bit high outside of RW, I was thoroughly impressed and would definitely consider CDA for a special night out.",

Paella was under cooked, we had to cancel it, cuz we don't want to wait 30-45 mins for it.

First, the waitress left without getting our full order, then she said that she put in a different order because we spoke a different language!? About 30 min after arriving we asked to go over everything that we've ordered just so we won't have more miscommunications. After we were done with main course, had to wait another 15 min to order dessert. We've got surprised again, waitress left with half order, I only had time to order ice cream for my daughter. As for my wife and I, we didn't get to order any desert, just watched our daughter finish the ice cream, paid the bill and left. I don't recommend this place, restrooms are in hotel's lobby on the second floor. Worse restaurant experience we've ever had. In two and a half hours that we've been there for, we had been asked once how the meal was, finished my water and nobody noticed.  Don't recommend it, I expected more from this place, it feels like an average PUB food and drinks in a high end hotel. Very disappointed!",

Unfortunately, at these prices, and in this neighborhood, the service should be much better.  To illustrate: during our last visit we waited ~15 minutes for our bill.  We finally gave up and went to the host stand.  Another miss - if you order the \"American Breakfast\" you automatically receive coffee and the pastry cart - a good deal (and the pastries looked great).  However, the last time we were there we were never offered pastries.  After reviewing the bill, the charges for the pastry were still present.  We couldn't find our server to ask for them to be removed so we just paid.  Little things like that make a big difference in a city with an ample supply of high quality restaurants.",

Trust me. It\u2019s worth the wait.  Breakfast is the only meal I have eaten there. It\u2019s not cheap. With a tip, it\u2019s always $26-$28 for me. It\u2019s my splurge for the week. I go there every week. It\u2019s amazingly consistent. I\u2019ve yet to have anything that wasn\u2019t terrific. I highly recommend the yogurt, granola, compote bowl. The pancakes are out of this world. Well of course it comes with real maple syrup and French butter. I should mention the coffee. It\u2019s a French press and it\u2019s impressive for. $5.00. I\u2019m a bacon and eggs guy. The bacon is always freshly cooked, not dragged off the north-forty of the grill for a quick heating job. The French cooks ( and it is a French kitchen) cooks eggs perfectly. A secret from me to you, let your waiter know you\u2019d like to skip the potatoes and instead have a taste of fruit. This isn\u2019t your ordinary fruit. It\u2019s blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, etc. picked at perfection. Best berries in the city. One of the things I love about this place is food temperature is right on the money. I\u2019m saving the best for last. Shortly after coffee is poured your waiter will come by with a long tray of croissants, chocolate brioche and bread. There is no better bread or pastry. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever had a better croissant in my life. Not even in Paris.",

One server who seemed to be very unhappy about working there (maybe because she'd been highly educated in her country and thought this was below her?) treated us like we were commoners, and when my elderly dad mistakenly took a piece of bread instead of a croissant, she didn't want to give him a croissant instead. She complained to the manager, who allowed him the substitute. The server's attitude was rude, apathetic, and condescending. I've experienced better customer service at McDonald's and many other places, and I'm not facetiously saying that. Bottom line: the service doesn't match the price, and the decor is basically like an eating hall, unless you're lucky enough to sit in the more upscale front area. The food is very good, but going forward, I won't take my chances again. Not worth the price.",

Romi, the singing waiter provided theatrically French attentiveness without being stiff, and Chef David visited our table multiple times to make sure we enjoyed everything.  Perhaps all this attention was due to our ordering the menu degustation, as none of the other diners seemed to be having it. I can\u2019t imagine why, as it is a real deal. David checked with us beforehand to make sure it was okay for him to serve different members of our party different dishes in each course, and we enthusiastically agreed, as it allowed us to sample twice as many dishes.  And dishes galore there were, each artfully arranged, and accompanied by thoughtful wine pairings. I\u2019ll let the photos speak for themselves, but suffice it to say that each was just as delicious as it looks.  The pastry chef continued the trend with four spectacular desserts, some of which she concocted on the spot.  We will be back soon, as the creativity here seems endless.",

Smoked salmon was okay, but the bread and onions didn't pair well. Mesclun green salad was pretty good, and whatever ingredient looked like dirt underneath the salad was amusing and creative. Chicken and waffle was mediocre, as was the omelet.  assorted mini desserts ~Mediocre. We got honey vanilla parfait, a chocolate layered cake, and a strawberry panna cotta with nuts and strawberries. Honey vanilla parfait was too sweet, and I didn't like the pairing on top. Cake was okay, and the panna cotta was more like a marshmallow.  Service was disappointing. They gave my gf oj instead of the grapefruit juice she ordered. I brought it up to a male server, but they still didn't fix the problem.
