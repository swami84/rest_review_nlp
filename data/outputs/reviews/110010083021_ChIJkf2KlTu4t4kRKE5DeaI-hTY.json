As other reviewers have stated, there are often panhandlers outside harassing everyone who goes in and out. More than once I've had someone attempt to pull a scam on me outside.  As for the store itself, it's often quite dirty and usually does not smell that good. The soda machine and Slurpee dispenser are usually in various states of disrepair.",

It drains business away from much friendlier, much better local corner stores because the big $$ of 7-11 and this prominent corner gives it so much visibility.  It's pretty bad.    They mark products as one price but when you get to the register it's a higher price.   A lot of things are near or at their expiration dates.    The store is often filthy.    They don't bother with keeping the grounds up at all.  On my last visit the weeds out front were a foot tall.  Customer service is hit or miss.  I have to honestly say I've had reasonably ok service, but more often you just get a cold stare and and outstretched hand demanding your money.  They do have a no panhandling sign up but it's rare that I don't get panhandled by somebody standing in their entryway.   They seem completely unconcerned by this.  Yes I admit I'm part of the problem.  Sometimes I have something on the stove and this is the closest market to me.   So I give in and use them.  But every time I feel like I've contributed to the problem.",

Don't buy any of their food - it's left to rot under a heat lamp for multiple days, more so than any other 7eleven I've been to.  The staff also seem to delight in crushing every chip bag they handle, probably on purpose.
