Why are there soo many large TV'S everywhere? Very distracting flashing lights within inches of your head trying to have dinner. Next time I'll ask for seating away from TV'S. Is this supposed to be a Sports Bar now? Or why soo many TV'S?  I'm sorry. I was soo hopeful this renovation would improve it. At least is is cleaner. Fresh coat of paint, new tables & chairs. I'll go back but wish these things would change for the better. When driving down Patrick St, we used to see a bright red awning to know when to pull over to park. It is now black so blends in. I parked 1 1/2+ block away that requires a long walk. Maybe add Huge flower pots that are red or add decor that's red so it catches our attention as we're driving to notice it. Trying to help.
