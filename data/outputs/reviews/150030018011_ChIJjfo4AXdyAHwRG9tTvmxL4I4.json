Another kind of clerk who seems to be kind to me is what I feel like, but I responded and changed my behavior, but my disgusting aunt did not give up. I was prepared to pick up a side dish, and when I pointed and responded, I was shouted many times at Four choise !!! x 5 (an attitude that can be said in English). The number of prepared dishes was the smallest so far. I was sad because the clerk did not do that. I will not go anymore. If you are a Japanese person, be careful if you have a good old lady who has been going for quite a year. It \u2019s really kind to Koreans. The next Korean couple was very happy with a smile.

Ok, so then she hurriedly asks for your 4 sides (which, by the way, they switched mine and my husbands, so we had to switch our food before we could eat), and upon leaving, she did ask if we wanted a bag for our plates. So then I thought, \u201chow nice of her to ask\u201d, but then she grabs a bag and literally throws it at us! Although I wasn\u2019t expecting her to bag it for us, she didn\u2019t need to throw it at us. Food was ok, I can get more and better quality with way nicer service elsewhere. Won\u2019t be coming back. Sad to think she\u2019s treating our visiting tourists this way too. Auwe!  No aloha!",

It was bluntly blatantly presented, and when I presented the card, I was told that payment was also cash only, I apologized but apologized but I was ignored and hated a bad face  Since I did not have a cache, I just went home.  I wanted to go buy again with cash if I'm happy.  Maybe it is delicious if you eat it, but I will not visit again because I will not go to a shop that does not like me.

It's an obvious taste, but on the one hand, it's hard to find this quality in the Honolulu food court.  If you want to eat Korean food, be sure to go for one meal.  You can also choose 4 side dishes, but this cucumber kimchi has a very unique taste.  The new pork ribs that have been new in the past few years are also okay.  And it's difficult to agree with reviews that the staff are unfriendly. Since it is run by Koreans, you must have expected it to be quick and skinny like in a Korean restaurant.  This is a place where you don't have to tip and give food for takeout. It's not even a place where they laugh and serve formally for tips.  I wonder if you ordered it with a soft smile first.

(Original) Every single time when I visit Honolulu, I go to this small restaurant for my breakfast. It has been almost 8 years.  A famous spot for Local. Should visit here if you stay in near Waikiki beach area.  Resonalble price, unbelievable amount of food, yummy side dishes always. And always nice taste BBQ.  \uc774\uacf3\uc5d0 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc624\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c\uc9c0 8\ub144\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4\uac00\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud55c\uacb0 \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8\uc758 \ub109\ub109\ud55c \uc591\uc5d0 \uac10\ud0c4\ud558\uace0 \ub610 \ud55c\uacb0 \uac19\uc740 \ub9db\uc5d0 \ub9cc\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \ubed4\ud55c \ub9db\uc774\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud55c\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud638\ub180\ub8f0\ub8e8 \ud478\ub4dc\ucf54\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc815\ub3c4 \ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ucc3e\uae30 \ud798\ub4e4\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc8e0.  \ud55c\uc2dd \ub4dc\uc2dc\uace0 \uc2f6\uc73c\uc2dc\uba74 \ud55c\ub07c\ub294 \uaf2d \uac00\ubcf4\uc138\uc694.  \ubc18\ucc2c\ub3c4 4\uac00\uc9c0 \uace0\ub97c\uc218 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uc774\uacf3 \uc624\uc774\uae40\uce58\ub294 \ucc38 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub9db\uc774 \uc788\ub124\uc694.  \uba87\ub144 \ub9cc\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c \ub098\uc628 \uc2e0\uba54\ub274 \ud3ec\ud06c\ub9bd\ub3c4 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc9c1\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd88\uce5c\uc808\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5d0 \uacf5\uac10\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc774 \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub2c8\uae4c \ud55c\uad6d\uc2dd\ub2f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc98\ub7fc \ube60\ub9bf\ube60\ub9bf\ud558\uace0 \uc0b4\uac11\uac8c \uad74\uc5b4\uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uae30\ub300\ud558\uc168\ub098\ubcf4\ub124\uc694.  \uc5ec\uae30 \ub531\ud788 \ud301 \uc548\ubc1b\uace0 \ud14c\uc774\ud06c \uc544\uc6c3\uc73c\ub85c \uc74c\uc2dd \uc8fc\ub294 \uacf3 \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud301\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6c3\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc11c\ube59\ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uacf3\ub3c4 \uc544\ub2c8\uad6c\uc694.  \ubcf8\uc778\uc774 \uba3c\uc800 \uc0b4\uac11\uac8c \uc6c3\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc8fc\ubb38\ud558\uc168\ub294\uc9c0\uac00 \uad81\uae08\ud558\ub124\uc694. \uc77c\uacac \ubb34\ub69d\ub69d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub118\uce58\ub3c4\ub85d \ubc18\ucc2c \ub2f4\uc544\uc8fc\uc2dc\uba74\uc11c \uc778\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc798 \ubc1b\uc544\uc8fc\uc2dc\ub294\ub370 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \uae30\ub300\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub124\uc694.",

The most important thing to know is what 4 side items you want with your meal. Don't even try to tell her just 1 of your 4 choices while you hum and huh about the rest. She won't even begin to scoop that macaroni salad you just told her you wanted until you tell her all of the items you want. She'll just stand there staring at you saying \"and then? And Then?
