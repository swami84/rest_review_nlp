In fact, they threatened not to give him the pizza if it happened again, even though we paid for it. The problem is that I ordered using Apple Pay which does not store credit card numbers. So I would not have been able to prove that I paid for the pizza. I contacted customer support on their Facebook page . I was told I would receive a response within 72 hours.  I contacted them again after 100+ hours and was told they would contact the store\u2019s owner. It\u2019s now been NINE days and nothing!! This shows how much they even care!!!",

When this EXTREMELY RUDE woman finally came back on the like she said my pizza had already left (LIE) The app said it was still being made though. So I told her I was going to leave a review on here and she said, okay, whatever. Yeah, she really cares about her job or her reflection on Papa Johns. \ud83d\ude44I then called back twice to cancel my order and NO ONE ANSWERED MY CALL. When I called from an alternative number someone did answer and said it had JUST LEFT, which was 10 minutes after i spoke the the rude, LYING, woman who answered my call after a 8min wait and ignoring my next 2 calls from the number she originally spoke to me on. I just received my pizza and guess what ONLY ONE TINY PEPPER, not even the standard 2!! I will NEVER EVER order from this unprofessional establishment ever again. I\u2019m disgusted with this woman\u2019s attitude and total lack of care for her job!!",

My daughter called back they told us that they couldn't do the order with two different flavors after the young lady who answer the phone the first time did. We wanted a re -order they told us we had to return the food we already had. The wings that they gave me were just wings on top of sauce the sauce were no where on the chicken itself. We called back they kept answering and hanging up the phone and when I finally got a hold to someone I heard ppl talking in the back ground ask should they hang up on me and I couldn't get a hold of a manger for about 40 minutes. They had me on hold on the phone for 20 minute. We ask the manager for corporate number instead of giving us the number he gave my daughter a refund and a new order.

I can make one from scratch in a half hour. I can drive to the grocery store and get a frozen pizza in 15 minutes. I can hang up and call a competitor pizza restaurant in 5 minutes. I did the latter.",

You need to understand this area - there are some seriously stupid people in this area.  Illegal aliens, people who can barely speak English, my neighbor is 40 and can barely read - this is south florida folks - you wont find more idiots in one place in the rest of the country.  And yet they still deliver in reasonable times and have done the right thing for me more than once.",
