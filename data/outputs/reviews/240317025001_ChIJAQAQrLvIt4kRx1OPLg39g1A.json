Their food is always fresh and flavorful! Sushi is made fresh by their sushi chefs while you watch! They are always nice and their restaurant is small and very clean! One thing...if you want to pick up logistics are a bit tight because you will not be able to park and run in, as it is on a busy street with no parking. There is a parking garage directly across the street. If I order to go, I will just park across the street. If I order pick up, I usually have to take my daughter with me so she can run in and I circle the block. If you stand on the street you will get a ticket. It is a heavy pedestrian area so watch out for that as well.",

The lunch specials are generous and delicious, with many of the dishes costing $10 or less and include 1-2 sides. I opted for the 3 roll sushi lunch special, and the rolls were beautiful and delicious.  I was thrilled to find Dan Dan Noodles on the menu, but I was wearing a white blouse so that wasn't an option for lunch. Fear not, I still ordered it to-go to enjoy later, and I appreciate that CT took the time to package the broth and noodles separately. This spot is relatively new and undiscovered compared to the other sushi in the area, so I'd definitely give it a try when the craving hits.",

Some of the fish on the sushi plate I ordered was bad and I got sick because I ate some of them before I realized. The tempura prawns were EXTREMELY oily (yes I know they are fried but the sheet of paper under them was soaked by the time they brought it out to the table). Service was very slow even though there were only 2 other tables occupied, they had already been served. The other dish we ordered was more celery and oil than meat. Tea was luke warm, not hot at all. For all of those issues I gave one star.",
