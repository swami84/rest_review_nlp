The good: A/C works well (it was a hot day). the Tibs sauce is very good. nice bar with a small selection of mostly inexpensive beverages, TV in the corner tuned to Soccer (World cup at the time) being watched by several regulars. Reasonable prices The bad: bathroom was barely big enough for a realatively slim person to fit, and not as clean as I'd prefer for a place where you eat with your hands. They we're out of pork(It was on the menu), AND beef which cook/waiter recommended was very grisly.",

The place is small but there was a group of 8 nearby, so definitely accommodating for all sized groups.  The food was delicious - some of the best lentils I've every had!  We had to eat everything with injera, which is fine if you enjoy the Ethiopian style of bread.  The highlight though, of course, was Beth! She was so sweet, and even taught us all how to dance \"the Ethiopian way!\"  If you want a great taste of a new type of ethnic food, definitely choose Selam.",
