        "caption": "[POISSON CRU] I'm a fan of oka (Samoan style cerviche) where I always buy it when I see it available just to experience different styles of preparing it. That being said I'm definitely a fan of the poisson cru since it's so similar in preparation. While eating I kept trying to figure out what was the nice refreshing light citrus flavor which turned out to be lime (oka is made with lemon) that I really liked.  I think this is like only my second or third time trying Tahitian food in my whole life so take this review with a grain of salt. But let me say that I'm already planning to go back.",

        "caption": "Perfect meal for a hot day! Light, fresh, but most of all very good...the food will make your taste buds dance!  From the Tahitian/French fusion menu, we shared the traditional poisson cru au lait de coco and the gravlax bruschetta.  The ahi in the poisson cru was fresh with no stringy suji. It also featured local tomatoes, onions, and a nice, bright coconut and lime sauce (think ceviche), with rice and naturally sweet taro on the side. Loved it!  The gravlax featured their house cured (not smoked) salmon, lovely fresh greens, and shaved parmesan, laid on a dill and cream cheese base, with a delicate balsamic dressing. Soooo yum!  Of course, we had to have a slice of their pie with Tahitian Vanilla topped with an optional praline crumble on top. \ud83d\ude0b  The 2 young people running this place are a delight to engage with. This is a tough business, and I hope they succeed.",
