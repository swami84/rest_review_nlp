No one could take our payment by the register, we could just walk out without paying and no one would notice. On our way out about 20 people were waiting in the hall while there were 7-8 tables available inside, just careless service and a diner food. Do not recommend!",

We ended up waiting for about an hour to be seated, they had several tables open but said they only seated people they believed they could serve. The line went down the hall and around the corner; none of the staff went to check on the line but kept telling people arriving the wait was 30 minutes. The wait staff tried their best, there was only one person cooking for a busy brunch crowd. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't as advertised on their social medias, we saw the cook put pancakes in a microwave so there's that too. Proceed with caution, it's a long wait and most people left. Seems the owners don't care enough to manage the place better. We ate and left immediately, I wouldn't say the wait was worth it and will not be returning.",

There was a crowd at the door waiting for tables and no waiter ever came up to say what the wait was or take names. There was plenty of open tables. The couple in front of me got tired of waiting and left. I eventually just sat myself at a table and they served me.  Food was not bad, but not overly tasty. My observation of the kitchen (it\u2019s an open kitchen) seemed to imply that the pancakes and waffles are made from a grocery store box mix (Krusteaz).  Probably wouldn\u2019t go back again.",

We went for brunch and all of our dishes were extremely bland, it should not be hard to make eggs, cheese, and hash browns taste good. Secondly, the decor is really shabby. The instagram photos look great but in person the place looks cheap and dingy. Thirdly, the service was quite poor. Everybody was nice but it seemed like nobody had told the servers anything about the place. There are no cocktail or beer menus at all and when we asked for one we were told that they have \"wine and some beers\".  Now you might be wondering how in the world a place with this poor of a review got three stars. The saving grace of this place is mostly everything on the menu is under $10 so it's not like you are getting screwed. If you want low priced, low quality food in a low quality setting then you might enjoy the Attic, but I will not be returning.",

Same two lousy servers one had dark complexion and curly hair wearing glasses, other was a fair skinned and blonde kinda athletic looking. Neither of them took my order promply and I was very patient and kind to them. Took 15 minutes for a coffee and water, than 45 minutes for a cuban breakfast sandwich.(which i never received, I just ordered a cuban since it was almost lunch time and probably was faster to get) I wasn't helped by either of the two servers mentioned above. Instead it was another girl who usually works at the register (tattoos and kind of rocker looking) she was super cool and understanding.  I will never give that business another dime of my \ud83d\udcb0. If you don't look like a huge meal ticket to either of the two lousy servers mentioned above you will be forgotten about and they will attend everyone else except you.  Cook was nice and register girl was nice. Once again was upset about this service but didn't make a scene. Hope your experience was better than mine.",

Great open space and nice views of downtown Tampa with a huge set of east facing window sliders that can be open on those cooler days and nights. Plenty of natural light permeates the space but not in an overwhelming way. They have draft beers on tap with a small selection of bottled beers and wine to go along with their brew. This place definitely has a trendy look and feel but in no way pretentious.",

For brunch, I had the corned beef hash with a side of bacon. The hash was great! The flavor was incredible. So good. The side of bacon, while it may have seemed, measly, don\u2019t judge a book by its cover cause it had great flavor. The staff was warm and welcoming. The atmosphere was industrial and cozy.. and the prices were incredible. Will be back for sure! Follow jetlaggedjosh on Instagram for more travel photos!",

To me this is not acceptable as theres no reason they should mircowave their chicken as it gives it a gummy and off taste. I was expecting this place to be a bit more upscale and fresh with the food, but I was sadly disappointed and will likely not return. In my opinion no restaurant should microwave their food, its a disservice to the guest and shows a lack of effort. Also the cook wearing gloves grabbed her phone and then proceeded to stick the same gloved hand into a bag of chips and placed them in a togo box with my food. I immediately canceled my order and left after what I witnessed.",

Also a trick to get a laugh out of her, just tell her she reminds you of Red from Orange is the New Black ;) because she genuinely will. But there is no lacking here in this cafe's quality either, the lighting and decore is pleasant to the senses and its very easy to relax here. Of course around lunch time you can expect lots of business oriented meetings and interviews due to its more trendy urban feel.

The burning sensation was oaky, with a bit of first degree burns around the corner. Upon dipping my finger into the actual cortado, the burn was much more mild, complemented by the frothy milk on top, adding a layer of fluffiness to the touch.  Olfacoception : Hints of vanilla at the back end bordering on the sweet to nutty spectrum of flavor with notes of clove, maple syrup, and molasses making up the majority of the body.  Ophthalmoception: A visual spectacle worthy of Martha Stewart, GQ, and Gizmodo front covers. The collection of multicolored frothy swirls is a perfect allegory for the synonymity of man. It's as if the heavens themselves painted this masterpiece to show humanity the pool of Lazarus set in a fantastical utopia.  Audioception: As I bent my humble ear to the source, I heard everything in nothing. Inside was a perfect stillness. The culmination of the efforts and striving and pains of labor that bring about nothing but entropy. The noises I heard were those that people across the world seek their whole life for, captured perfectly in this tiny cup. Absolute perfection.  Gustaoception: Tasted like espresso with warm milk.",

The Attic is located inside a building in downtown Tampa and has great view of the Tampa skyline.  The coffee selection here is pretty decent and they have a good selection of pastries. On the day I came into the shop, it was in the late morning and my friend was able to order freshly-made waffles to eat with his coffee.  There was basically no one in the shop, so it was very peaceful and quiet. The service was friendly and hospitable.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here or have coffee here since I live in St. Petersburg, but it's a nice little retreat if you're in the downtown area.",

New 4th floor  space is now open and it is impressive. Great open space and nice views of downtown Tampa with a huge set off east facing window sliders that can be open on those cooler days and nights. Plenty of nature might permeates the space but not in an overwhelming way.  They have draft beers on tap with a small selection of bottled beers and wine to go along with their brew.
