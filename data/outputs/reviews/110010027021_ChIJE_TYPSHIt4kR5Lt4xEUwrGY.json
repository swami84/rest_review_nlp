Chicken & waffles were delicious, the pancakes so good.  Not sure what their secret is with the texture of the pancakes, but it\u2019s a winner.  Slightly crisp on outside.  With the delicious coconut you really don\u2019t need the syrup at all.  The red fish was beautifully done and the other dish was a fried rice egg combo. Didn\u2019t catch the name of that.  We were all very happy.  I\u2019ll come back for sure.",

During this pandemic, you have to go to their market to be seated at their patio, which is first come, first serve. Their market sells blankets, hand knits, wines, beers, fresh flowers, Filipino snacks, and a wide array of desserts. I couldn't walk out without buying Corn and Rice Pudding, Potato Chip and Blue Chocolate Cookies, and Ube Cupcakes. The outdoor patio had infrared heaters. They offer complimentary hand warmers and hand sanitizer.  We weren't impressed with the craft cocktails (e.g., Campfire Crush and Spicy Calamansi Margarita) we ordered. The Campfire Crush consisted of rye, peychaud's bitters, lemon, and smoky ginger ale shaken, served over the rocks, and garnished with a rosemary sprig. I didn't like the flavor nor the bitter aftertaste.  For appetizers, we shared a Cantaloupe Salad, which consisted of cantaloupe topped with shredded snow peas and sliced red onions tossed in a light ginger soy dressing. It was refreshing and spring like.  For entrees, I got to the try the 25oz Bone-In Braised Short Rib Bistek and Maitake Adobo. The 25oz Bone-In Braised Short Rib Bistek consisted of a soy sauce and calamansi braised bone in short rib served with sauteed onions and potatoes, house salad with lemon vinaigrette, crispy onion rings, and a side of garlic fries. The meat was tender, juicy, quite flavor, and slid off  the bone. The Maitake Adobo consisted maitake mushroom, carrots, and zucchini roasted in coconut milk, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves. It was delicious. However, it would have been nice to serve it with a bowl of jasmine rice.  For dessert, I got to try their Flourless Chocolate Cake with Fresh Strawberries and Ube Bread Pudding with Ube Ice Cream & Caramel with Sparkling Wine. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was sinful. The Ube Bread Pudding was to die for.",

I ordered a bunch of entrees from Sinigang to Laing to Bicol Express and Bulalo. Three of four dishes were amazing, they got the right spice for the Bicol Express, the right sour taste with the Sinigang and that Filipino taste with Laing but the Bulalo threw me off. I have been raised in the Philippines and Bulalo usually consists off bone marrow,potatoes,corn,vegetables and of sort. The one served for me was ONE piece of short rib, vegetables but without the corn and potatoes, and dumplings. I have never seen dumplings in Bulalo and it wasn't even on the menu. The menu stated that it has a bone marrow and the rest. I made it clear with the server and manager that this is not Bulalo and most certainly is not worth $20. Server and manager told me they will remake the dish but ultimately gave me just corn and potatoes. I didn't say the taste was bad but if I order Bulalo, I expect to be served Bulalo. The manager was nice enough to give us complimentary desserts. If you are a Filipino or a Filipino food enthusiast, this is not a place for you. I gave it 3 out 5 because the other dishes were okay, it's just I take pride of our dishes because I cook them to at home and the owner is Filipino. Thank you.",

First off the lumpia, which is one of the most popular & my personals favorite finger food. I was disappointed! It tasted fake as if it were store bought, the meat looked & chewed like rubber. It didn\u2019t taste fresh at all.I also ordered the chicken adobo(which is another favorite) & I was also disappointed. My friend ordered Tocino & garlic rice. We both enjoyed the rice. The tocino was a little burnt, but was still eatable. We also ordered sinigang. I can honestly say, that was the best dish (As a whole) that was delicious. Cooked great seasoned well. The vegetables were delicious.",

During the covid pandemic they offer about 50 covered seats right outside their storefront and have hand sanitizer at each table.  While their vast drink menu lists really thoughtful cocktails, I super recommend their Spicy Calamansi Margarita or Sour with perfect amounts of heat and strength! Then to start, Mama Alice's Lumpia arrives piping hot with a real delish and downhome taste filled with tender pork/beef in a crispy wrapper with a lovely banana ketchup sauce. Then their sweet and spicy Calamansi Wings are a real winner!  From their brunch menu, their savory Sizzling Sisig stopped the show with a smokey/steamy presentation of very tasty pork belly and shoulder with onion, vinegar, bird's eye chili, and lemon juice topped with a fried egg and a side of garlic fried rice. I actually finished the entire plate! Then my friends ordered their Eggplant Adobo Bowl and their Ube Waffles w/Filipino fried chicken and Ube Ice Cream and were both completely blown away!  During my previous visit, I thoroughly inhaled their Purple Patch Sliders and I'm sure they're still incomparable. With 2 exceptional experiences at brunch and dinner years apart, I recommend this spot as a must!  NOTES/TIPS: **Restroom down the stairs all the way in the back to the left. Diaper changing table and diapers available. All still available during the covid pandemic. **They charge your credit card table side. **Filipino snacks available upstairs even during the covid pandemic. **Female Veteran-owned",

I went here for brunch on a Saturday morning; unfortunately, the experience was a letdown with the food I ordered. I ordered the Waffle with Ube Ice Cream and Filipino Fried Chicken as my entree, and Bread Pudding with Ube Ice Cream as my dessert.  The good: The restaurant itself is a small area located upstairs, and it is nicely decorated. If you make reservations, they print out your name on a card, which is a nice touch. The ube ice cream is delicious! Has a strong delicious flavor, and I would eat a pint of this if offered. The waffle was warm and soft. I would enjoy the entree, except for one issue: the chicken.  The bad: The chicken was very dry for being dark meat. You're given 2 pieces of dark meat, and I was hoping for it to be moist and tender, but it was dry all over. I really wish I could have enjoyed the dish, but the chicken ruined the experience.  Overall, I'll come here again to check out their other food since there aren't too many delicious Filipino restaurants that are mentioned in the Michelin Guide. The banana bread with ube ice cream is delicious! However, I would order only ube ice cream because it is my favorite part!",

        "caption": "We went for brunch to celebrate my mom's 50th birthday. We had a moderate sized party that changed to a larger party of 19. They were so great at accommodating us with the changes. I didn't find out until we were waiting for them to open that out party size dropped. When we told them after they had already set up the table, it was no issue. The absolute best part of the Purple Patch was the hospitality. From second I emailed about the reservation to everyone that visited the table. Everyone's attitude was stellar. It really was like we were at an aunt's house because we were at ease. They were slammed and the bit of the wait at the table didn't bother anyone due to the vibe of the restaurant.  The mix up of the food for the Filipino/American Brunch was really innovative and fun. I haven't been to any other Filipino restaurant where they mixed it up like they did at the Purple Patch. Out of our party of 14, the favorites of the table were:  Mama Alice's Lumpia (now you know your mom's is always the best, but these were the closest to my mom's) Ube Pancakes & Macapuno Syrup +Lechon Kewali (the pancake was different, but the the lechon was the best. I was so juicy and tender. If you don't get this meal, order a side of the lechon) Ube Bread Pudding w/ Ube Ice Cream (out of this world good. No nuts in it (for those with allergies) they make everything in this in house. We should have ordered more for the table.) Halo Halo (Just a classic with a twist. Delish)  We had two toddlers there and they have an area by the restrooms with lots of toys that is semi closed in. It was a nice touch. The booster seats attach to the tall chairs and the children's menu were great. The fruit bowl was a great mixture of fresh fruit. All this to say that it is child friendly place.",

Ube flavored deserts hold a special place in my heart as my Nai frequently made them growing up (halaya & roll cakes, I still daydream about you).  Overjoyed to find out I could get a taste of these here in DC, I went to  brunch with my partner to try these sinful cakes. The texture and taste was perfection; soft pillowy lavender stacks with an understated sweetness, lightly drizzled in macapuno syrup. The amount of pancakes provided was filling and left me thoroughly satiated...but ah, it was over all too soon.  Objectively speaking,  these are best pancakes to grace the entirety of my existence. I will be back, most likely settled in the corner of the restaurant gleefully ugly sobbing at our tasteful reunion. Try the cakes, please!",

A Filipino friend recommended this place, and with two friends we went together. We were blown away by the excellent food. The four of us each ordered 2 drinks, an entree, and dessert. At the end of the meal, just as we recieved the check from our server (who was in no way a problem) we were very rudely told by the host that we must leave quickly as the table was needed for another seating. There was no apology, no gentle ask if we wouldn't mind, no attempt at politeness. He didn't even bother to observe that we had just signed our checks and he could have waited another 2-3 minutes till we left on our own. It was 5 till the hour... not even at the hour that the table would have been scheduled. He immediately began calling servers over to begin bussing our table, and even took our glasses away while we sat there stunned at how absurdly rude the host was. Just before this moment, we had been happy and speaking with each other how wonderful everything was. The rudeness ruined every last bit of that warm and glowing feeling. The manager, who we immediately asked our server to bring, looked horrified when I shared what had just happened, but she offered no apology for how we had been treated. Her response was strange.  If you come here, don't expect a pleasant experience. It, too, could be ruined in the very last moments of your visit. The food was good, but not worth the strange and rude treatment from staff.",

My personal favorite was the Pancit Canton, the table\u2019s favorite was the Laing. For desert we shared   Ube Bread Pudding w/ Ube Ice Cream \ud83d\ude0b ...the food was so delicious I ordered 2 meals to go for my family, they enjoyed the crispy egg plant and the Alimasag Fried Rice which were both very tasty! This was the first time my mum had lump crab fried rice and she loves crab \ud83d\ude0b definitely coming back to enjoy more meals including the desserts... the red snapper looks amazing as so does the Turon... I will be trying those next... be sure to make a reservation, the place is very popular",

Lechon kawali is really good so yummy it's an appetizer here  3. Pork sinigang - it's different.. It only has potatoes and some kale I think. It's not as sour and doesn't have the usual sinigang veggies like eggplant and string beans. It kind of taste like nilaga. Not sure but the pork has this old meat taste like maybe too frozen before cooked?  4. Chicken adobo is okay its not the dry chicken it's saucy. It's okay  5. Leche flan is I guess ok but I think they used egg whites for it coz the texture and taste is different from the original or creamy Leche flans.  6. Staff are pleasant and nice. The owners are there and nice Ms Alice would say hi to the guest she's a lovely woman.",

We got started off with some Lumpia which was served with ketchup instead of the sweet and spicy sauce? Idk why. It wasn't too bad but I'd prefer the sweet and spicy sauce with lumpia.  My chicken adobo hash wasn't super great. The meat actually had this old stale taste for some reason and it was kind of dry so it was hard to finish. The garlic rice wasn't even warm at least. One of us got the sizzling sisig and the meat wasn't minced up small enough. The meat that should've been tender was actually quite dry and bland.  Towards the end our waitress kind of rushed us. We asked to order dessert and she brought us a check instead and left briskly. So all in all, average filipino food and service. Definitely not worth driving to dc for.",

The service here is in step with the food and the drinks have a nice take on some of the more exotic fruit juices of the Philippines which was very refreshing since it gives you more than the run of the mill options. But of all the great qualities i could go on about, the thing that makes the place so warm and inviting is the chef and owner Patricia. She touches every table and greets everyone as a old friend. Awesome place from casual to a big friends and family dining. I'd call ahead for reservations for a special occasion as they will take the extra steps to make you feel appreciated.",

A true shock and very pleasant suprise! We ordered the Lumpia as an appitizer. It was crispy, not as full as authentic lumpia but no complaints here, it was good. For the main meal we had Chicken Adobo and Egg Plant Adobo. The Chicken Adobo was a slight twist on the original but very delicious and the broth was to die for. It made me want to go back home to the Philippines and the San Miguel Beer was the icing on the cake. It was comfort food when i needed it most. I Will be back!",
