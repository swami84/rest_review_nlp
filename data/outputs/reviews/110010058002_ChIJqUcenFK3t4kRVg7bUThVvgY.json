The eggplant sabich is a total comfort food and I dream about it often. Combination of roasted eggplant, potatoes, egg, cabbage, amba and green schug sauce. It is huge and fills you up big time. Last time I tried the grass fed beef pita with potatoes and that was really good too. Even though with all the Covid19 fears, I am hoping to get a sabich tomorrow. Update We had the ara\u2019is a while ago. It tasted good but it was too salty due to the pita bread I think.",

Their hummus is definitely my favorite (compared to any other hummus I've had and as a vegetarian for ten years I can tell you I've had a lot of hummus \u263a\ufe0f) whether it's in their cauliflower shawarma or ordered in a tub for me to snack on later. Seriously it's so creamy and delicious!!!! Their pita is always fluffy and fresh and pickled sides are yummy add ons. I personally always get the pickled onions \ud83d\ude0b.

I had never been to Little Sesame's original location but I had heard plenty of good things about it, so I was excited to try this place out.

We ordered the chicken shwarma bowl and the shakshouka bowl. I preferred the chicken bowl but was honestly taken back by just how much hummus there was in the bowl. We had two pieces of pita bread and had to order two more to soak up all the hummus.  Let me be clear: I don't hate hummus. This amount of hummus, though, is honestly too much. I really liked the pita bread but wish they would use some lettuce as a base instead of half a tub of hummus. I left feeling uncomfortably full.  The food is good of course and the service was very friendly. I'd be back but I'd be really hesitant on getting a bowl since it's so much food.",
