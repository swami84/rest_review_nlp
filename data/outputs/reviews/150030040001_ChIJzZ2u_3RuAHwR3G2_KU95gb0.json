I would normally give a place like this a 4 star but I have my prejudices... if you do Dim Sum, you better do all the Dim Sum. Lots of dishes that I don\u2019t see kinda limits your choices, but the stuff they have is good quality. The outdoor food court setting doesn\u2019t make for the best seats in town, especially when you\u2019re looking up towards the Main Street, but that\u2019s not their fault. Definitely a place to visit if you\u2019re wandering downtown for Lunch.",
