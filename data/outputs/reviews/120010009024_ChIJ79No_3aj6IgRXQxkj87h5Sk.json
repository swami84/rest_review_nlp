The person in the open kitchen area was really enjoying her job of chopping chicken into serving sizes. The noise permeated the entire restaurant. One would think a gentle chop would also work. Also there is a sauce bar allowing multiple choices of sauce to add to the chicken. The floor was soo sticky, I had a hard time moving after standing in front of the bar for a minute or two. A good mop and soap would be in order",
