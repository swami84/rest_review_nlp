I expected a Catfish fillet & instead got these pieces, which flavor wise was pretty decent. Problem for me was I'm from NY, but my roots in the deep South & I like my fish fried hard. Everywhere I went in Baltimore, soggy fish seemed to be the norm, & yes I still prefer a fillet. The collards were okay, a lil sweet for my palette, but the Mac & cheese & cornbread were on point. I get the feeling, If I lived around there & visited more often, they could accommodate me on certain requests. This was my first time there & I'd not only return for myself, but recommend to others going to Baltimore. I'd try other menu items as well as get them to fry my next order of fish hard. Overall, a good experience. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff",

I tried to get something low key and simple like fried shrimp as a light snack... don't make the same mistake I did because they don't hold back! I got so much jumbo shrimp that I could barely finish it. WELL WELL WELL worth the price.  The server suggested I get some gravy for the side of rice I had and it was 10000% a game changer. Highly highly recommend doing that as well. If you're reading this review and hesitating please do yourself a favor and grab a plate. You will not be dissapointed.",

What i ordered, the honey garlic wings which comes with two sides, and cornbread. Candied yams-amazing best i have had, potato salad incredible i scarfed that down, wings were pipping hot and humongous. Extremely delicious all around, oh yeah the cornbread was good.

The wings was cooked seasoned and baked to perfection. I left my plate and came back hours later because the food was made freshly it didn't spoil as to some kitchens. The smell of food was great. This kitchen is in a very great location in southwest baltimore the fed hill location. It was clean and very neat and also place to dine in. Paid parking along street side. The owner was very friendly as she greets everyone polite. She even talk to me and was willing to get a feed back. Now that's what makes a great chef. I recommend this place you wouldn't be disappointed. Run quick get your southern soul food in fed hill area.",
