As soon as you enter, you're greeted by a cozy, modern atmosphere. The food is seriously incredible. It's my favorite Thai place in DC, and I go here a couple times a month. Flavors and quality are incredible, and pricing is about on par with the area. If you love Thai food, definitely give this place a try!",

There aren\u2019t as many vegetarian dishes as I\u2019d like, but this is a good go-to place for those regular Thai dishes that I can eat over and over again.

Located in the 14th St corridor, Rice maintains the trendy, chic neighborhood vibe with its earth-toned interior and sleek, full-service bar. It can get pretty busy, so I\u2019d recommend coming on the early-side to ensure you\u2019re not sitting too close to any other loud patrons. The food is very good and they offer a nice array of options to pick from. They frequently have specials like a curry sampler. I\u2019d recommend getting the Papaya salad with shrimp, Green curry with beef, and the Seafood basil. The presentation of food is tastefully done \u2013 simple and clean. The portion sizes are pretty good considering the prices. I strongly encourage you to look at the seasonal menu, so you can try some special foods. This is a great date night spot and wouldn\u2019t be ideal for small children. There\u2019s an outside patio with seating available for those nice weather days. They also have a small market at the entrance with lots of Thai cooking ware and trinkets.",

My Dark and Stormy was strong, but not so much as to make it uncomfortable for me to be back in the office. Of particular note is the generous happy hour policy, which runs from open to 7pm on weekdays. I'm struggling to think of another restaurant which operates similarly.

As we entered we were pleased that this place was already packed with customers. Good sign. However one negative sign that I overlooked, in retrospect, was that asian:non asian customer ratio was too low. I consider high ratio is a good indicator of the quality/authenticity of asian restaurants.  I started with a tom yum soup and for the main entree I had their specialty three course thai curry meal. The tom yum soup that I had....my god...was the worst I have had so far. It was so watery and sour that I felt it was a \u2018tom yum soup\u2019 flavored vinegar. Besides liquid portion of soup, you will get a couple pieces of half mushrooms and tomatoes, and three shrimps in a small bowl. And they expect you to pay $8 + tips + 10% tax.  The three curry thing that I ordered was mediocre at best. It was initially fun to try three different types of curry. But first, in each bowl of curry, meat was not shredded or cut. It was a chunk of meat. If you plan to serve a chunk of meat, they where the heck is a knife? In asia we don\u2019t use knife because meats are served precut so that they are already a perfect bite size. Without a knife it was extremely inconvenient to eat those meats. Also amount of rice : amount of curry ratio was low. This was $20 + tips + 10% tax.  So.. we ended up spending at least $25/person at there (I spent 31) for sub par food. You don\u2019t even imagine how much I laughed when I found someone on google map review commented his experience \u201ca party in the mouth\u201d.",

True, the rice is pressed and shaped and you won't get as much of it as in a traditional Asian carry-out, but the rice is dense and perfect. You will not leave hungry.

Others were so noisy that even an open table couldn't pull us in.  Rice had immediate seating and a fine ambiance--a bit loud, but you get used to it and to having to shout a little to make conversation.  The food--excellent.  I got pad thai with chicken, my fianc\u00e9 got the spicy duck.  We both Mmmed repeatedly throughout the meal, and were hesitant to offer the other person a second taste of our own deliciousness.  The garnishing and portioning were also fine, and our waters were refilled a lot.  For two people and two dishes (no appetizers, no drinks, no desserts), we were in and out for under $20pp.  Not terrible, though still a little pricy.  I'd happily recommend the place, and would certainly go back if friends invited me... otherwise I'll be checking out other great Thai offerings in DC.",

How often do you see something like that? Great dish and a sure thing to try at least ones. I couldn't taste the anchovy too much, but still enjoyed this very much. -",

And today I had the Penang Curry Chicken with Rice (spicy) and I was floored by the taste/quality/quantity of the entree! I only wish the quantity of rice was a little more than what I got. (But less rice is compensated with a lot of blissfully tasty curry!)  PS: I get stuff at this place to go, even then I am extremely pleased with the service and atmosphere (being offered a glass of water while waiting to pick up my awesome penang curry feels too good!)",
