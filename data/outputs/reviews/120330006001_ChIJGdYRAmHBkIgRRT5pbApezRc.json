The best thing I had were the greens. They were delicious. The worst thing I had was the fried oyster appetizer. The oysters tasted old like they had turned, but luckily there was so much batter on them I could not taste the oysters anyway. I told the server the oysters were \"not good.\" She did not even respond. The \"cheese grits\" were also no good. Tasted bland and like they were out of a box. No flavor. Bad texture. The grilled shrimp was pretty good, but too salty. The gumbo was a 6 out of 10. Not worth the $70 price tag for lunch. I would not go back again even if it was free.

Although the Fried Fresh Catch that you get at Sidelines is a much bigger portion of fish. It always hangs way off the bun.  I always take half my sandwich home at Sidelines.
