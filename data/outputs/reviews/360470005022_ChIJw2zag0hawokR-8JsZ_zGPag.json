It turned out that the shop is in the back seat of 124 Montague. It is a small store with only one bench for three people. It is backed by kitchen window glass. The place is neat, clean and quiet. , Beautiful, service is good, the waiter works diligently, prepare food in two or three minutes.

I've been trying to avoid meat during lunch lately and they have a lot of tastey options, like vegan noodles, bowls and soups. The staff at this location are so bright and cheery too.  My only gripe is about their Android app. There are some serious navigational issues that I wish they would fix. You can't just browse the menu without starting an order. The Saving of favorite locations isn't working, so I always have to search for the same location to start my order. I always go to the same one and after try to order ahead as I am walking there. The Saving of favorite items isn't working either. Then, if you are building your order in the app, the UI is confusing to the point I often back out to change my mind and have to start over by searching for my store again. Very annoying. Please fix soon!",

And I, first of all, no one calls me. I left my number you would think that they would see that something is wrong but who knows who or what they have working there no one calls me. I try to call I can't get to anybody.

I had one bad experience that was dealt with really terrible customer service- the chia pudding on my 120$ splurge turned out to be bad. Told the manager at the Williamsburg location on my visit that came after that. He looked at me as if I'm trying to scam him and gave me really bad attitude. Wrote the company, got a replay from Leah, the vice president. Said twice she will send a gift card (for the 8$ worth of the chia pudding, forget about compensation for the disgusting treatment I had to go through). This was nearly two months ago. And still nothing... A company that does not care about their customers, about the quality of their products and about the overall customer's shopping experience is not a company I choose to support. To bad since I really did like their products. But now I get a sour feeling when ever I pass by a store.",
