        "caption": "This is a recently opened Thai restaurant that unfortunately opened right at the start of the stay at home order because of COVID-19. It took over a spot that was once a Japanese restaurant across from DFS T Gallaria on Royal Hawaiian Ave in Waikiki.  Although they didn't really redecorate or remodel, it was in excellent condition, brightly lit as well as clean, so it made up for the move-in without much change. I actually liked the fact that it was brightly lit verses dark and shadowy like a lot of Thai restaurants sometimes are.  This restaurant is tactfully a sister location for another Thai restaurant in Honolulu. They have all the typical Thai favorite dishes as well as an extensive menu of offerings.  I was dinning alone for lunch, so I only got one dish. When eatting Thai, most people think of Pad Thai. An alternative of Chinese influence is Rad Na or Rad Nar. It is wide noddle dish with a gravy and either some sort of protein and vegetables or vegetarian with a little bit of kick. For this occasion, I got it with just vegetables and it was excellent.  The food was prepared fresh and served hot with good service. Defiantly would like to go again and try other dishes there. Only disadvantage is there is no free parking in near vicinity.",
