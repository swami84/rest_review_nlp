However it is truly shocking to me that a place like this could stay in business during the Covid19 pandemic where so many other local places that are WAY better have been forced to close. Where to start? First of all our \"table\" for two was a 1'x1' ledge along the side of the wall. No room for anything and risk of knocking over glasses/bottles. The wine list STARTS at $60. We paid $68 for a decent bottle of Chianti which was marketed as natural but nowhere on the label did it indicate as such. I didn't even dare look up the retail price of this wine as the sting would be too much after everything else. The MOST egregious thing, however, was the $9 \"Italian olive\" appetizer. Shocking. This was literally grocery store olives (one variety) with no oil or marinade, served awkwardly in a cocktail glass alongside a few sliced raw cherry tomatoes. I counted... the dish cost me $1 per olive. Truly unacceptable. Trader Joe's has better marinated olive variety pack for $2 retail. My dining partner got the \"wagyu\" beef which was served with a single Jerusalem artichoke and it is very questionable if the beef was truly wagyu. To top it off all around us were wine bottles and grocery-type items that I assume are for sale as a revenue-boosting element. During our meal the server somewhat randomly would come and stand next to us counting all of these items for (?) inventory... somewhat odd. The decor theme is a mix of.... steampunk and Polaroids of former diners which are taped manically all over the walls of the restaurant. I wish we hadn't chosen this place but in the freezing cold on a Saturday night it was slim pickings. I will never be back!",

The staff are beyond kind, really generous with their attention, and deeply knowledgeable, very much worth talking to. The food is really good, and the wine selection is truly impressive. Outdoor dining is also available, and the staff was very pet friendly during my time there, bringing water out to dogs unasked. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cute place to get top notch Italian.  My one warning is that their only egg free pasta is also gluten free. So if you are vegan and/or have an egg allergy make sure you're looking for non-pasta options. If they were to get a non-egg pasta this would easily become my favorite Italian place in the city.",

I got the Cacio e Pepe scrambled eggs which blew my mind. My mom was born in Italy, and I\u2019ve grown up eating authentic Italian food my whole life and the food here both measured up, while providing its own unique twist on classics! The service was great, and very Italian in the sense that they were attentive, but not intrusive; I enjoyed sipping my coffee slowly while sitting outside in the sun, and didn\u2019t feel pressured to pay and leave (as is so often the case in NYC). Highly recommend!",
