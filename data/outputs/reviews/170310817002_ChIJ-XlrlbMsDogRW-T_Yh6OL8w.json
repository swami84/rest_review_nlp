They told me that there was a problem and my pizza would be leaving in 10 mins. I figured it was an issue where GrubHub and them didn't sync up so I just let it slide.  @ 8pm I called Grubhub again and they told me after calling Rosati's that there was a shift change and that somehow my pizza was lost between the day and night shift. They said it would be another 40 mins or so.  @ around 9:20pm, still no pizza I called Rosati's myself asking if I was ever going to get this pizza. The manager had an attitude, called his driver, said the pizza would be there in 2 mins.  So after almost 5 hours I had a pizza. A pizza that wasn't even hot. Almost as if they purposely left me last on the delivery list. After eating said pizza I was up every hour on the hour running to the bathroom because somehow I ended up with a stomach sickness.  I'm always nice on the phone with customer support because I feel you get better service when you're not yelling at people. I feel that I didn't deserve the service that was given. The GrubHub  people were very nice.  I've lived in this city for 30 years since birth aside from a few years in the military and I have NEVER had such horrible service from ANY pizza place in the city. And I've been to almost all the named pizza places in my city.  Anyway, I felt compelled to share my story. Gratz to Rosati's for getting my first public complaint ever!  Also part of the pizza was missing cheese.........",
