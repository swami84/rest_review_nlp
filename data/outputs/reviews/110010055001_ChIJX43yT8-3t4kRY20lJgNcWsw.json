A small shop along Connecticut Avenue Northwest in Dupont Circle, they offer takeout and safe pickup during the pandemic. And wow, it's tasty!  We ordered chicken green curry, panang curry, pad thai and drunken noodles and the flavors were bold in each dish. They also balance the spice well giving each dish a little kick without being too much.  We ordered online and our orders were ready right on time! Service is friendly.",

Honestly I'm usually skeptical of Thai places because they've become oversaturated in my neighborhood, but we knew we were in for some awesome food when we saw lots of Thai students in there for lunch.  The vibe is eclectic and lots of fun. The food is fantastic and really emphasized the street food aspect to encourage you to treat yourself to new items that you don't find on standard Thai menus. Of course there are familiar items, but if it's your first time here, try something you won't get somewhere else!  Oh and the plating is gorgeous! Every dish came out and it looked like time was spent putting it on the plate. Of course the best was dessert! Mango sticky rice! Beautiful! And it was SO GOOD! The rice was still warm under the cool and exactly rip mango slices!  It goes without saying that the staff of great too! I'd definitely like to come back to see the dinner service and see the place transformed at night.",

        "caption": "What a great restaurant! We walked in and were immediately greeted by their hostess and wonderful workers. They were very charming and super nice. Their interior consisted of neat collections of small items and cool lights. It felt quite cozy to eat there.  We ordered from their lunch specials as we ate there around 1 o'clock. I got the Spicy Basil Fried Rice with chicken/pork and also ordered the Thai Ice Tea. They were really flexible with my Ice Tea - I was hesitant of ordering the tea because of my dairy allergy. But they worked with my allergy and replaced the milk with lemonade. Again, super nice!  The tea was a little too sweet for me but it was still really delicious. Next time I would definitely ask them to tone down on the sugar level.  I love their lunch specials! It comes with the entree, a spring roll, and soup. The soup came first and it was mixed with chicken and mushrooms. All together it tasted sour and spicy which was really good. Then our entrees came out and again, I got the Spicy Basil Fried Rice with chicken/pork. It also came with the spring roll on the side. Needless to say, it was all yummy. The meat wasn't dry at all and the portions were huge. It was pretty spicy so next time I come, I'll tell them to lower the spice level.  After our food, we ordered their deserts. I got the raspberry slush. It was nice and cold. I could chew on the small icicles in it which I really like. It was great for the hot summer day after our meal.  I got to know the owner who was extremely friendly. She, in addition to our waitress, constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing ok.  It was a great experience and I'll definitely be back. Highly recommend this place.",

My rule of thumb is places that do two different type of cuisine (sushi) usually churn out mediocre food.  I tend to like Thaitantic better on 14th which serves more 'authentic' cuisine and only Thai food. Overall all they do keep us going back as one of the good ol stand by when I'm in town and in the Dupont Circle area.",

The sushi was OK, This place was good to me because It was the first time I had sushi about three years ago and Since I fell in love with it back then, I wanted my friends to enjoy it as well. BOY WAS I WRONG. The services was terrible!!! First I could not understand one word the woman was saying, I asked about plates and she was no help! We ordered the FRIED RICE with steak and it was delicious so we thought hey, the sushi will be good. THE ROLLS WERE SOOOO BIG they did not fit in our mouths!!! We asked if our friend could buy avocado for his fried rice and he was told the avocado would be THREE DOLLARS PER SLICE, YES NOT ONE AVOCADO PER SLICE WE ASKED TWICE! The server took forever I mean FOREVER, to bring back my friends sushi, we literally ate our rice and then he came back with those huge rolls of TEMPURA, which by the way only had tempura shrimp inside and big pieces of lettuce, I almost thought I was a rabbit. SO WHEN IT CAME TIME TO PAY, THE SERVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE TO ASK WHY HE HAD GOTTEN THAT TIP. My friend said well its simple, I felt like HE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB, before we knew it a RUDE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID OH IS THIS UR FIRST TIME HERE, AND WE SAID YES, AND HE SAID OH IT WILL BE YOUR LAST AS WELL. The server came over and took our plates and our water from the table!!!! THE SO CALLED MANAGER WAS CURSING NEXT TO THE TABLE AND LITERALLY CAME OVER TO MY FRIEND AND YELLED AT HER FACE TO CALL IN AND COMPLAIN IF SHE WASN'T HAPPY. HE WAS SO BEYOND RUDE I WAS SO EMBARRASSED THAT MY FRIENDS HAD TO GET THAT LAST MEMORY OF DC. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE! they ARE RUDEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! AND VERY LOW CLASS!",

It says Thai on the sign and they do have a large selection of Thai dishes, but they also serve up some really interesting sounding sushi rolls and have a small sushi bar against the wall in addition to the tables. The high ceilings alleviate the crowded feeling due to the proximity of the tables and at night it could almost pass for intimate with the low lighting if you're along the wall. The food wouldnt bring me back, but the speed at which it came out was astounding and would definitely make this a great spot for weekday lunch.",

The sushi is always fresh, the portions generous (by contrast with Sushi Taro) and the staff are extremely conscientious, hard-working and efficient.  You will not feel like you have spent an hour in a Japanese ryokan but you also will not feel like you have been ripped off.",
