Came here to grab a chicken burrito for lunch, which was hot and delicious and exactly what I was craving.  While I was waiting for my pickup order, I witnessed a super rude woman at the counter yelling about onions being in her food. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fCome on, people. Have some humanity.  1) this is a mexican place. there's basically onions, tomatoes, and peppers brasied into everything. That's what makes it mexican food. 2) Don't be rude to staff. Even if you said 'no onion' when you ordered. (This woman admitted that she *didn't* say no onions...\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) These are hard-working staff at a small local-owned food stand just trying to do their jobs during an insane and stressful time to be a food-service worker. Just ask for something else instead, ask for your money back if you can't eat anything, or realize you messed up and shouldn't have ordered what you did and pick out the onions and move on with your day. Ugh. 3) I went back and threw a 100% tip in the jar and apologized on behalf of the other customer to the worker bearing the brunt of her wrath.  So dumb to even have to write this. But the staff seemed worried about the wrath of the other person (who was threatening to have her 'powerful local friends' post all over social media about these dredded onions...) so I wanted to counter that, for humanity's sake.  Anyways, if you're looking for hot and affordable tacos and burritos with a ton of veggies in them and lots of upgrade options, this is your place! (Get a side of the home-made salsa for dipping - yum!)",

As in, the guacamole we had didn\u2019t even compare to our Austin, TX guac. Fresh, not over salted. Amazing. I had a veggie tamale. Good lord that was authentic and fresh, moist, and as it should be. Not overpriced at all. Friendly. And clean!! Definitely will be back here. This place is a freaking gem",

Standing behind the counter coughing, coughing, coughing then he touched the food, the spatula, the sour cream bottle, then the hand in the tomatoes, all of that. I asked them do they have gloves they said not right now. But said they wash their hands every time they touch a customer's food. Then I stood there for a while and watch the cook rub his face and then touch the burrito shells/food for the order that just was placed. Before all of that I ask do they have guacamole for the taco bowl, the lady at the register said that they don't have any because she didn't make it because she has other things to do. When I pointed out the fact that they were touching stuff and coughing into their hands while touching customers food the man said that I don't have to eat here I can eat at McDonald's. Apparently they're the only taco place in the area and they're going to get business no matter how they treat people or their food.",

It honestly was just a less chunked version of chicken that you could buy in canned form. The biggest complaint of all was that the nacho cheese was somehow massively bland also. It was clearly of the canned variety but not even the tasty golden goo that is in gas station nacho machines. It was just gloopy and flavorless. I got bold and ordered Horchata with my meal. It tasted extremely watered down and was also a major disappointment. Never again.",

        "caption": "I'll be one of the people to add to the horrible ratings. Only reason why this place has business still is because of its location in close proximity to bars. It's 5/4 (derby day), 11:00 pm and I just got out of work, I'm a bartender at a nearby bar. The run a special that says dinners for $6 on Friday and Saturdays. Multiple times I have come after brunch and dinner service when I'm done with work (we're open till 10). Always have I been served the special for $6. I have a set schedule with demands I work those days of the week. Quite frankly the only reason why I go to this place at all is for the special because it's so cheap. The food is barely edible, but again, hey it's cheap. I come in tonight and order the steak taco dinner and they try to charge me almost $12. I ask them about the special. The counter girl looked caught and turned to one of the line cooks and asked him about it. He looked at me and said no. I told her by law if you have a special in a place that serves food you have to have that special all day. It was only $11 (I work in a restaurant full service and fast casual so I know). He didn't care turned back around. Then she asked someone else and he said no. She said he said the special was only between certain times. I said that is not true, for the 6 months I've worked around the corner that's never been the case. She said I could talked to him myself (she was rude and clearly disinterested). I went over to talk to the man cooking and after him ignoring me for a bit, he had an immature attitude (He had to be over 45 at least) and said the law I pointed out wasn't true, they can Do what they want. I asked him well what imaginary time brackets do you guys do the special then. He blurted our 11am-9pm. Again, that's a crock of baloney because I've always gotten food from there after work and we close at 10 and I don't get out until even later. The money isn't the issue (I have enough of that) it's the principle. They are dishonest to their guests and price gouging. Not to mention trying to take advantage of patrons potentially intoxicated and leaving the nearby bars. It's illegal (the law I mentioned exists) and unethical. Especially for their barely edible food. Also, half the time I'm in there you'll be standing at the counter and it can be empty in that tiny place and they won't even acknowledge you when you're standing right in front of them. Very rude. I'm going to go to big wig right across the street from my high rise and get better food and quality service. Never coming back and I don't suggest you do either the food is nasty, hence all the cheap specials.",

After waiting 10 minutes because the cashier was taking an order on the phone, we ordered 6 tacos that according to their advertised prices on their menu board should have cost less than $18. The cashier instead told us our bill was $28. After we politely asked him \"why is it so expensive because the math doesn't add up\" he impatiently replied \"because the prices on the board are not updated.\" After I politely asked that I want to switch my order due to the mislabed pricing, he said \"give me a minute\" because he wanted to answer the phone and take the order. After we insisted he take our order before taking an additional phone order and naking us wait even longer, he asked us to \"do him a favor and go eat somewhere else\". So we went to big star and spent the same amount of money for much better tacos and better customer service. Never eating at or recommending flash tacos ever again",

It's the closest to street food you are going to get on that corner of Chicago.  Burritos could be a little bit bigger for the price (8 dollars) but you are pretty much just there to sober up.  The one thing I like is the hot spicy sauce.  But beware it is extremely spicy.",
