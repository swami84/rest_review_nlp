When we went to ask about the entree they didn\u2019t bring out the owner or manager Nison or Nisim or whatever that disgusting human beings name is told me it\u2019s cooking. It\u2019s cooking for 4.5 hours? Instead of apologizing he gave us an attitude and started cursing us out. He told us if you wanna eat, wait, if not, leave. This is how they treat customers? Did we come here to eat for free? Disgusting place, disgusting service, don\u2019t waste your time or money here. Absolutely repulsive place and service!!",

The management is rude, the waiters overwhelmed and understaffed, food not fresh ( found things in it) and in all honesty we were ripped off when the bill came because what was discussed was not provided....I only wish I rejected the charge and disputed it with my bank which I still may do. I mean the waiters couldn't even pour drinks and the carafes were always empty, people were thirsty.  From the amount of food for actual price charged this is  by far the stingiest place in Brooklyn...and I've been going to russian restaurants for over 20 years. 125 dollar banquet and there is one plate (small dinner plate) of potatoes...for 9 people....okay.  4 people from my party had dietary restrictions....not for all the food just the main course, which was discussed before. We waited several hours for the dish (branzino) and when it came it was raw and inedible...so people at my party went hungry. Let that sink for a moment in a pre-banquet restaraunt. Oh and the manager told me he was doing us a favor accommodating....again....why not just refuse my booking, make both our lives easier.  Our table was charged for people who we agreed to be alacarte, not part of the banquet....so we wound up paying 240 dollars for fish tacos. Note, for restaraunt, if you cant accommodate then dont agree...I didnt pull your tail to agree.  I wont be one of those people that say money doesnt matter as I've learned in life you need to pay for what is good...but you also have to fight for when you're getting fleeced and in this place....you will be ripped off.  So all in all 1. Rude management....check 2. Less food than promised....check 3. Lack of basic respect for the customer (management not staff) check.....great success.",

Food was okay, service was not good, my friend basically had to pour shots for us and pass the food on the table throughout the night.  Furthermore, my other friend wore his new suit jacket, and throughout the night, the chair he was sitting on completely destroyed the back of his jacket - there was a small metal needle that kept snagging the jacket. (careful where you sit here!) Once we tried to explain to the management what happened, they practically laughed in his face and basically said he was lying and it was impossible for it to happen, and just left him standing there. You can see on other review sites confirming how unprofessional the management is.  Luckily, we had drinks (which were not part of the banquet) which made it a little bit better experience. I know I'm not coming back.",

However, at one point there were lots of ants on the table crawling all over next to our food. When the ladies started screaming and got up in disgust and we tried to get staff's attention, we had to wait a while, as if the staff was programmed not to pay attention. One waitress was trying to put a serving of meat on that same place, and when I told her that there are ants there, she turned around and continued carrying the order to another table as if nothing happened. Unbelievable! It took about twenty minutes for a few people to come over and clean the table. No one offered any kind of apology. Is this really not a big deal ??? The food was very different than in other places of this type, but I cannot say it was outstanding. Some dishes were great, some, so-so. Other than the situation with ants, the waiters were friendly and helpful. I believe they lack training in unusual circumstances. Management should take this into account and provide better training for their staff.",

They delivered everything exactly as it was promised to us. The food was absolutely delicious! The food at cocktail hour was yummy and plentiful with many different hors d\u2019oeuveres being passed around in addition to the food standing on the bar. Max, the restaurant\u2019s band leader, even came out during the cocktail hour and played the saxophone for the guests. It was the perfect touch to an already spectacular event. The waiters and waitresses during the reception were perfectly on point, delivering a ton of amazing food to the tables without disturbing any of the partying! Even though we hired a DJ for part of the night to entertain the teens, the restaurant\u2019s own live band come on later in the evening and they were phenomenal!! Not only did they put on a very entertaining show, the singers were incredible and delivered all of the songs beautifully. They were fun, exciting, and really kept the partying going for adults and kids alike! Highly recommend this place!!",

They went beyond my expectations and have been accessible and receptive to any wish I had. I also felt that the price for what they offered, was incredibly fair.  I did a lot of shopping around before deciding to close out this space for this event. The cocktail hour with such diverse & delicious hors d'oeuvres was fantastic! The food served during dinner was fresh and abundant. We sat down with the chef prior to this event,  and creatively came out with the menu. He's very knowledgeable and clearly loves what he does. Also, because it was a private event, I had a say of what type of music we wanted. The musicians and singers are quite talented & know how to make the party fun. In terms of service and communication, we primarily dealt with the owner and also his manager, who was very helpful and did whatever they could to make sure we were satisfied. I would definitely recommend this place for either private event or dinner celebration with family and/or close friends, or just a romantic  night out with your loved one.",

Also recommended this place to many people.  So made reservations to celebrate my daughter sweet 16th birthday this past weekend.  What a disappointing experience it was.  I must say that food and music were great as on prior occasions.  However,  the service was terrible!  One waiter for 2 tables with 20 people each.  It was incredibly slow, the dirty plates never got changed, we had to constantly ask, and do it ourselves.  Had to run after the waiter to ask him to bring hot food, and there was a big delay in between appetizers and main course.  When it came time to bring the desert,  the main course and plates weren't taken away, and desert and remains of main course as well as dirty plates were there all at the same time.  There was no milk for coffee brought up,  the fruit platter was put at one end of the table , and guests on the other end of the table had to fend for themselves.  I understand it was not a waiter's fault, but management's, but they still charged me 18% tip.  There was also another big party happening at the same time, and I don't know if that was the reason for one waiter serving both of our tables or management way of saving by not bringing enough waiters.  There were minor things that were promised to us, such as closing of the bar and putting away bar chairs since our party was near the bar area ( not by our choice).  Also some quests brought flowers, we asked the waiter to take them like in any restaurant which they gladly did, however,  nobody brought them up to us when we were leaving the restaurant.  We also forgot about them and only remembered at home, since it was too late to go back we called the owner next day, he said he will get back to us.  And he did at 10:30 pm and said that the  flowers already went dead.  Just unacceptable.  But  I wouldn't complain about that  if the service was appropriate.  I won't recommend this place to my friends anymore or on social media.  But if after reading this review, you still decide to go , make sure there is no other big party going there at the same time, or you'd be screwed like me.",
