Unfortunately it was the usual plastic teaspoon, not a soup spoon.  That aside, the soup was served very hot, so let it cool.  But it was excellent soup with several wontons, ramen type noodles, bok choy etc.  Soup was in large bowl and I could only finish half, taking the rest back to hotel for later.  Otherwise they have the usual food court Chinese fare. Service was ok and friendly.",

My hands were full will my tray and drink and I accidentally left my wallet on the side of the cashier counter. I went right accoss from the counter 2 feet away to get a drink and utensils. then sat directly in front of the restaurant to eat. 5 mins past by and I realize I left my wallet at the counter so I walked right up to the counter and asked where was the wallet that I just left. The person at check out told me the manager took it and walked it to security. This was very suspicious to me because the girl at the counter saw me leave it there and instead of handing it to me when I was 2 feet from her she decided to give it to the manager and have him walk it half a mile away down to the security desk. Of course when I got to the security mall desk (which was a mission to find) my money was stollen which is to be expected, but all my cards seemed to be there (I had 8 different cards in my wallet.) Turns out I did not account for one because a few days latter my bank alerted me that THEIR STORE MANAGER DECIDED TO FRAUDULENTLY TAKE MY DEBIT CARD  AND USE IT TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.   Don't believe me I attached a photo of my bank alertly me of the suspicious activity.",
