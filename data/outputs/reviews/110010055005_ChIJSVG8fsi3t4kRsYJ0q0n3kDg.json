Then we got news that the owner/ Chef had died in early 2021.  Very sad news.  He was charming. After he had cooked us amazing plate after plate of different fishes, he came out and we sat and drank together until around 2 in the morning.  It was so special we had been trying to plan for another trip from New York with our main purpose being to have another night like that, then Covid hit.  Our sympathy for the staff which were like family to him, and his family and children for their loss.",

(Our waiter was better but did not seem to care about the guest experience) Bar Tender came out screaming and cursing the kitchen at one point which silenced the whole restaurant and didn't end until another staff member intervened. Value was perhaps the biggest disappointment. The highlight we shared with the tables adjacent was the pure absurdity of the affair. It was an experience for sure, just not the one we'd expected!",

My companions enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad, and 30+ mussels as appetizers, and the halibut with clams and branzino entrees. Although the complete bronzino was served as a display, it would have been pleasant for the server to deboned it as they always do in Italy. For dessert we enjoyed the sweet pie slice topped with slightly tart lingonberry sauce, goat cheesecake and raspberry sorbet.",

We both had a drink, appetizer and an entree. While the food was ok. The value for what was served on the plate was another matter. If you have ever eaten at a restaurant and had to go eat afterwards then be prepared for that with Pesce.  I had the grilled octopus and my boss had the grilled calamari. The appetizers were ok but nothing that stood out. We were looking forward to the entree and both had the sea bass with vegetables and mushrooms. I would say that I was more surprised at the size of the entree it was a miniature portion for a 6 year old not an adult. My boss and I thought it was a joke and were looking around to see if we were being punked on camera. However, this was really happening. $32 for a piece of fish that wouldn't fill a kid. We ate and immediately left dissatisfied and upset at paying $ 80 each for what we were served. On my walk back to the Capital Hilton I found a poke restaurant called Aloha Poke near Dupont Circle, I got a small dish for $8 and was pleasantly surprised of the quality and freshness.  Note to Pesce, give your customers quality food and enough that doesn't make them feeling hungry after they leave.",

I think of the place as one of those gems of a bygone era before chain, formula and corporate eating places where kitchen help prepares dishes from photos taped to the wall. What you order at Pesce is individually prepared by the owner in a small kitchen, and it is authentically exceptional.  I recently had fresh cod with artichoke that was fabulous. The only reason I give Pesce four out of five stars is that Chef/Owner LaPorta is allowing meat to creep into his seafood menu.  For example, scallops with oxtail is not my idea of how to appreciate fresh scallops.",

They have a Tuesday special with a 3 course meal of lobster.  First course was a small teacup of lobster bisque (nothing to write home about), followed by a \"salad\" with a few small chunks of lobster, some steamed beets, etc.  Not really a salad... and mainly looked like something you would pick out of a trash can. The end was a tiny \"lobster\" soaked (and I mean soaked) in butter.  Lobster looked like it was half a pound (didn't know that restaurants served lobsters that small)... and so overly seasoned that it was difficult to eat - even if there were really only 4 or 5 sizable bites to be had.  We started off the meal with some overpriced oysters (one actually made my friend a bit sick to her stomach) and an octopus app (which was the best thing we ate all night).  Again - nice staff - but we will not be returning as there are far too many superior restaurants in DC.",

We had such a good time we returned a few weeks later just to eat. The third time we actually brought our significant others.  Pesce is a cozy place for a meal with friends or family. They're kind of a local secret that you don't want to get out. If you love seafood this is the place for you. We had the calamari as well as the octopus to start. Fresh oysters lasted us through cocktails before friends joined us for dinner. There were rave reviews for the butter fish, linguini with clams, and the mussels. We rounded things out with an after dinner drink, an dessert with plenty of forks.  The service was very attentive and friendly (no hovering wait staff) and we felt right at home. Even though the dining room was full, we could still hold a conversation without having to raise our voices. It's one of those places where they make a point to get to know you.",

We've eaten here four times, and each time was a little worse than the last. Most recently, when three out of our party of four arrived, the waiter refused to take drink orders or allow us to order appetizers, or even to look at the menu. But when our fourth arrived the waiter was all over us, lovingly describing dishes they'd sold out of while skipping over dishes actually available. A busboy broke a glass and left the shards on the floor. And then the sauce on the skate special was salty beyond belief, as if a half-bottle of soy sauce had been reduced to its saline essence. Still, if you want big slabs of expertly-cooked fish, don't care for vegetables or any other kind of side dish, don't mind scraping off inedible sauces, and are amused by weirdo staff, this is a place to consider.",
