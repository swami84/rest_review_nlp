They don't serve crab stick, the fish ball was frozen and poor quality, they don't serve you noodle automatically and charged $1 for it. The price of Scallop was crazyly expensive, it was like $8 for 4 pcs. I ened up ordering something cost me $35. And the food was really under average. I guss there was too little competition out there which makes this place still have business.",

I was so excited to try the Malatang in Chinatown and I picked some of my favorite food from the bar. The fish was frozen, the meat was frozen which added a lot of weigh to my dish. They even barge the bag of noodle for $1, it was just noodle. And the scallop was so expensive I forgot how much exactly they charge but it ended up to be $55 for two serving of Malatang for me and my boyfriend. The broth was too greasy and not tasty at all. It was just like they out the food into water and boiled them and put in some broth afterwards. I didn't enjoy the food. And I felt robbed.",
