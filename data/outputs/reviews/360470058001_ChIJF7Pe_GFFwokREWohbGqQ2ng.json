They deliver the wrong order, and then literally take what they have delivered to your home (after you open it), and deliver the \"correct order\" to whomever they mixed your order up with. That is completely unsanitary, and flat out disgusting. I politely called the establishment to speak to the manager,  and she \"Mercedes\" was very rude. Also, the delivery person \"Thomas\" ,took it upon himself to open whatever you order, and add \"additional sauce, in an attempt to supposedly do you a favor\". I don't know where your hands have been, you're supposed to deliver as far as I'm concerned! You don't open anyone's food with your germ infested hands to \"do them a favor\".

I said no and she said it will be about another 30 mins. 9:00 PM - I receive a call from Dominos.  The guy on the phone says \"hey this is Dominos, did you place an order about three hours ago?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"We got really busy this evening, would you like us to make your order or would you like us to cancel it?\"  \"Cancel it.\"  Unbelievable.

This dominoes should be shut down or go under new management and rehire their staff because every single person working here is rude and disrespectful. This job is solely based on customer service and they cannot even do that correctly. But what can you expect from a facility when the manager is rude and disrespectful as well. Sophia gave me attitude for asking why my food was late , when I told her I was going to report her she said to go right ahead because she was a manager - obnoxious little **. And to make matters worse the food isn't even worth it , takes over an hour to arrive and it's arrives cold . Never been this upset over service in my life .
