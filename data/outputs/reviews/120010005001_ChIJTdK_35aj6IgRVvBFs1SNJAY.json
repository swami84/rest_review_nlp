Each small plate they have on the menu is good for a meal by itself, or great for ordering several and sharing amongst your group.  We had the Fresh Veggie Spring Rolls and Fried Chicken Nuggs and both were delicious with a hint of Thai spiciness but not so spicy as to cause discomfort and pain. The sweetness of the spring rolls was refreshing balanced with the tingle of the spicy peanut sauce. I came super hungry while my date was less so, I ate all the chicken (she's a vegetarian) and half the roll and I felt totally satisfied.  The bar program really feels well thought out with little to no fluff added. We had 4 different items from the drink menu and each one was great. The \"Protect Ya Cuke\" was the best cucumber gimlet I'd had in Gainesville, and the \"Buzzwords\" cocktail was a pleasantly unique journey for a scotch lover like myself. The \"Springtime in the Bronx\" reminded me of drinking fun drinks by the pool in August and the \"Hai Chi\" was a great twist on Thai Tea although I think if I ordered it again I would have them make it a double as the bourbon gets a little lost in the sweetness of the rest of the drink.  The atmosphere feels higher classes than Gainesville is used to with beautiful murals on the walls and dim (maybe too dim if you need to read the menus) lighting in the bar area which makes it feel like a classy New York city hotel bar. The music was a great mix of old school hip hop jams all night.  I can't wait to see how Wayward Fox develops over time as they really find their stride.",

The service was a little disorganized but that's too be expected for a soft open restaurant; I expect it will only get better over time. I will definitely be coming back and I hope Wayward Fox is here to stay. It adds a little something to Gainesville.",

        "caption": "We really enjoy Crane Ramen and were excited to try this place out, but it let us down in a few ways. First of all, the food was pretty good--the dishes are creative and tasty, but didn't blow our minds. Alcohol beverages were small for the cost and did not taste great. Now for my biggest gripe. So, this place is counter service, not full service.  What is particularly awkward is that the food/drinks are a bit pricey, and you pay upfront and are confronted with a tip line for service (in our case, our bill was $60, so a $12 tip at 20%). How can you tip for service (particularly $12) if you haven't received any yet and it's not full service? You really don't even realize the level of service provided until after you order, when you find out fountain beverages are self-serve and you pick up your own plates/silverware. I have no problem paying a 20% tip for even average service because I know oftentimes wait staff aren't paid a living wage, but this situation was really off-putting. It would help to switch to paying after your meal where you can tip an amount appropriate for the level of service received.  UPDATE 1/10/2020: How cool of the owner to respond and change their process! Thank you! Star added :).",

Wayward Fox is a welcome addition to Gainesville's restaurant scene, with fun, fresh cuisine that makes you slap the table and swear in ecstacy. No, I'm not being dramatic; that's what my husband did after two bites of the brisket wontons. The boozy Thai iced tea was the drink I didn't know I had been searching for my whole life. The seafood omelette was pure, fluffy, umami heaven.  I can't say enough good things about the food, and the staff was its equal in friendliness and service. Stop what you're doing and go eat this food!",

The family style menu is super fun and encourages the exact sort of exploration that our titular Fox apparently went through himself (ask the staff to hear the beautiful story behind the murals on the walls).  Highly recommended the steak fries and the dumplings. Although you really can\u2019t go wrong, this place is high quality and excitingly creative. A rarity in Gainesville! Try it out!",

        "caption": "American Izakaya, think gastropub but with exceptional flair, you won't find a regular old cheese burger here. I had the tossed rice, Korean chipotle BBQ beef, with nahm prik (Grilled Mixed Peppers and herbs muddled in a mortar and pestle) we also got a house salad. Sauces are made in house, the spicy fish sauce blends wonderfully with rice, and the chipotle sauce has a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor with some smoke. The Fox House salad comes with a delicious miso vinaigrette, all in all the food was superb. Dining experience is trendy with eclectic music and lots of conversation. I got to sit down with the owner and bend his ear a bit, make sure to ask about the murals, they tell a great story. Dining experience is similar to tapas, ask the staff for guidance they'll take care of you.  Curry and noodles will change once a month with other possible seasonal rotations as well. All in all I give them a 5/5 for a startup restaurant, staff is exceptionally welcoming and super informative and friendly, I'm excited to see where they go from here and I hope you who are reading this enjoy them too!",
