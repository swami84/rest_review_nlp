        "caption": "Hi all, I just posted a previous review few minutes ago (see the attachment). I was really impressed how fast the owner saw it and came up to us. The owner explained to the situation he experienced due to changing weather conditions and problem with his staff. He was very polite and respectful. I agree that I didn\u2019t know the situation behind it and was very premature with my conclusions. Paying attention to the explanations and all efforts I\u2019m sincerely apologize fo him and his team, and giving 5* to this place, despite some inconveniences we had. Also, any one has seen owner running between customers helping his staff? I have not. It really impressed me! Thank you, I wish the strongest health and all best wishes to you, your family and your business!  P.S. My personal apologies again  OLD REVIEW  Now I'm at the Brooklyn Bavarian Biergarten right now with my brother, today is May 25, 2018, 7:45pm. Food is great and delicious, beer menu is also great, but there are some problems with service. We ordered Weihenstephan and Hofbrau lager but we were told something wrong with the pump and we can't get it. We ordered Grevensteiner, got the only one and were told they ran out of it. Also after ordering the first beer we were waiting at least 20-30 mins and no any waiter came to us. Moreover we noticed that many people were without any attention waiting to order, some people went by themselves to take the menu because nobody came since they took a table. So I'm giving 5 for food and beer, but for the service and how everything organized. Iguess is the fair grade. If you want to visit this place, food and beer are very good, but be ready to wait wait wait wait... P.S. atmosphere there is very nice and cozy",

They're not good people and the experiences have been awful.  Was an awful experience. I wouldn't recommend this place. With the food, the staff, and the parking nothing was good. You're better off somewhere else.  We were seated and started talking about the outdoor space with the server, the server told us we should go check out the inside space and told us how to get inside. We're inside looking at the hall and taking some pictures on our cellphone and this women comes out of nowhere and starts yelling at us. There was no in-between, she was nasty from the moment she opened her mouth. I explained that the server told us to come inside, check it out, and take some pictures but she just continued yelling at us. Went back outside to our table the server asked us what we thought and I explained what happened and they were not at all surprised that this woman had gone off. Apparently that's the kind of people they work for.  Save yourself a bad experience, after this I can tell you there's nothing worth having an experience like this. Just truly awful people and unappealing food. You'll see it expressed time and again in other peoples comments here. It's not worth it to put yourself through this.",

I felt a hint of gentrification, music doesn't fit the atmosphere nothing about that felt authentically german. 3. Very nice setting, outdoors. 4.

        "caption": "What a welcome addition to Brooklyn! Adjacent to the Grand Prospect Hall and with shared bathrooms, this is a lovely outdoor space with various levels and types of seatings (picnic tables, high boys, shorter tables) throughout a garden that is shady and cool with a WWII memorial smack dab in the middle of the garden. The space is well-laid out, staff is friendly and I appreciate that they serve brews from local breweries, cocktails and have a decent wine list along with a well-rounded food menu serving Bavarian and American bites.  I tried the wiener (beef and pork sausage) sandwich which comes with fries and sauerkraut. The wiener was delicious complemented by a great bun. The potato pancakes had a good onion to potato ratio, but they were a bit soggier than I like.  BONUS: They accept credit cards!",
