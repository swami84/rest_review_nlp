Everything was so delicious. Being from Brooklyn it\u2019s extremely hard to find any authentic Egyptian cuisine. This is a great place for large parties or a night out with your partner/friend. There\u2019s music playing in the background with dimmed lighting setting the perfect mood. If you are a hookah smoker then this is a win/win. You can smoke and eat while listening to some Arabic tunes. I can\u2019t forget the great service by Huda!! She was very attentive and efficient. The owner also came by to say hello and make sure all was well. He seemed like a very nice guy who cared about his business and customers. I will definitely be back soon with more friends  :)",

Few weeks ago my friends and I went to finally get some Egyptian food. They have two teens working with lack of experience. After ordering half of the menu because we were super excited and hungry. Our food took at least 45 mins. We didn\u2019t care cause we were so hungry. We decided to order family style so we can all share and try from each other. The first thing my husband tried was the chicken kababs and it was super cold. We kept trying everything else and everything was cold. We waited at least another 10 mins for someone to come to us. My husband had to go all the way downstairs for them to come to us (btw there was no one in the store, they weren\u2019t busy). We stated our concern with the food and made it clear that we didn\u2019t want our food to be heated in the microwave, we weren\u2019t going to pay over $200 for microwaved food. They literally came back with our food after 5 mins and all the plates looked exactly the same and we asked one of the teens if they microwaved it and they said YES with a nice smile. At this point my husband was really upset and didn\u2019t want to eat there anymore. We asked them to call a manager and told them we didn\u2019t want to eat. The owner came upstairs with an attitude and didn\u2019t know how to fit the situation. Coming from a restaurant owning family I know how bad reviews can affect a restaurant but this was really needed. Please improve",

When we made the order I asked several times if they could bring out the drink ASAP since I was super thirsty and, after waiting 30 minutes the food comes but of course not the drink. We asked again, finally got it. Once the food came, we asked that they setup the hookah so we don\u2019t have to wait forever and after we were done eating we asked for the hookah which took another 30 minutes to come! It was like we were begging for them to give us what we were going to pay for anyway. The waiter was nice and it wasn\u2019t his fault but it was clear that the owner is stingy and doesn\u2019t want to pay more people. Oh and the owner was there, sitting. Couldn\u2019t even help.

The Beef Kofta Kabob served with a Pilaf and Tahini, also the Stuffed Cabbage, was so delicious. The Hummus.. Everything was truly homemade. I am pretty sure that this restaurant does Not use MSG in their food like most restaurants do, because we did not get thirsty after we left. Kudos to the Chef and our complements  to the Owner. Also, much appreciation to Sami who took the time to explain the food and to give us a brief History on Alexandria. The service was amazing.",

I ordered Kushary (was good), Mahshy (very good but tiny portion & a bit cold, 6 pieces in a plate), Tagin lamb (regretted & not recommended), rice (was okay) but the decoration make you feel as if you were in a pharaoh temple!  \u201dThe tips was included but I didn't pay attention as they still have another line for gratuity which doesn't make any sense if you are charging it already!!! As I ended up paying gratuity twice which got the total up to $92 from $72 that is still very expensive compared to the quality of the food I ordered keeping in mind that leasing a space is very high in Steinway/Astoria!\u201d",

I ordered this Egypt macaroni thing and when it came out (with our drinks, finally) I took a few bites and hit.....frozen noodles. Yummy. I told the waitress that the center was frozen and she took it back and brought me a \u201cnew\u201d one. She told me watch out the plate is hot but she didn\u2019t say watch out your noodles are frozen again. Never again. Oh and my friend paid $4 for a can of coke. When I told the waitress about my frozen noodles for the second time she walked away, like I ordered frozen noodles on purpose",
