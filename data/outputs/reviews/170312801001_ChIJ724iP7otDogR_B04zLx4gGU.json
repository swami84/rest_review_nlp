I was worried that the food would arrive soggy (we are about 20 minutes away), but the tacos were wrapped properly, so that they didn\u2019t sweat in transit and arrived crispy.  The meat (we ordered beef, pork, and chicken) was delicious, and the consomm\u00e9 was deeply flavored and rich, with a smell, complexity and flavor that reminds me of a well made mol\u00e8.  2 tacos was plenty per person with rice and salad on the side (pour the broth on the rice).  I\u2019m thrilled this place is around the corner from my office, and will be going there for lunch and taking home dinner when we reopen.",

The birria fries where the highlight of the day. The consome was flavorful and so good. Birria tacos on point...and the mole wings caught me by surprise.Great job!!!!",
