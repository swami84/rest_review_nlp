We came with another adult couple and their children (three of them all under 5). We visited at lunch and there was only one other couple in the restaurant. We had cups for the kids so we only needed glasses for the adult. We started off with cocktails. The were all amazing. Mine was some sort of green tea infused vodka drink and I need it in my life again soon lol. Anyway, everyone enjoyed their drinks. Then we ordered 3 appetizers.  Only three of us ate and the other adult sat with the kids and read to them. All of the apps were unique and flavorful. The fries were great, the clams with some a bacon filled broth were also delicious, and the general tso wings were outstanding. The waitress even played with the youngest kid when he went exploring in the empty restaurant. Then came time for the bill. They added gratuity for a large group!! How? Why? You literally provided service for three adults for the whole dining experience. One adult ordered one cocktail and moved away from the table to play with the kids. This ruined my whole dining experience. They were basically empty and I guess adding gratuity was supposed to make up for a slow business day. Not cool at all. I\u2019m giving three stars for the food and drink because yes they were great. Taking off two stars because you would have received a 20% tip regardless because the service was great. But including gratuity when you only serviced four people....not cool.",

Our only complaint was the dips for the rinds was kinda bland and we didn\u2019t feel it had much flavor, could have been partly due to the sauces for the wings and pork belly being so rich and flavorful.

Drinks are expensive, but the food was a weird mock up of what people think asian fusion is.  The \"Phat fries\" were smothering in gravy that blocked the flavor of any other elements and it becomes a wet mess of potatoes with no standout texture or flavors.  Anyone could know the taste of instant curry packets from any asian supermarket with one bite of the curry from here.  The katsu pork sandwich would've been fine had there not been a pile horseradish inside it which blocked any other flavors from actually making the sandwich enjoyable.  We won't be coming back and I encourage anyone to read the menu throughly before considering eating here because what might sound interesting could be a total disaster of elements that do not meld well on a plate.",

Sake-coladas? We kept ordering them! But then it gets to the Buddha's Delight sandwich.  The first time we ate here right after they opened we got the Buddha's Delight and it was amazing, delicious, warm, great. Today, our party got two of them between the four of us. To say it was gross is an understatement, and we are fairly sure it wasn't even tempeh this time. Unfortunately it was a bad night for those sandwiches as everything else was delicious.  Great restaurant and I hate not giving them 5 stars, but yall have a problem with the Buddha's Delight sandwich that is in desperate need of fixing.",

        "caption": "Great atmosphere, kind waitstaff, hit-and-miss food.  My wife and I came to Phat Sammy's courtesy the perfect, five star review. Unfortunately, it seems as though we didn't get the same experience others have had.  First, though, let's parse out the good. Our server was an absolute treat, with a bubbly personality and an eagerness to make our experience a pleasant one. The atmosphere? The atmosphere was amazing! From the mural on the wall, to the seating and music, this was a really cool scene, with a lot of zest and excitement to it.  Unfortunately, though, there's a negative side to this story. This starts with the drinks. The cocktails were hit and miss. My wife's Punch was amazing, meanwhile my rum cocktail tasted like somebody filled the glass halfway with bottom shelf rum and made the grapefruit soda an afterthought. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan of strong cocktails, this would probably be a win for you, but it was not the stuff of the nice, smooth rum cocktail I was expecting.  The food? Well, we started off with the Steamed Bun appetizer, and I can say, this was honestly delicious. Mind you, I say that as somebody who generally does not enjoy oysters, these were great. That's where the wow factor honestly ended, though.  My wife had the \"Pineapple Goes on All Things\" bowl and, as she told me, it was \"Alright\". It wasn't terrible, but it was not something to write home about, nor justify the price tag. Meanwhile, I had the K-Mac burger and fries.  My experience with the K-Mac started out with a mistake, when I was brought a rice dish instead of my fries. No big deal, of course, as this is easily rectified. However, the man who delivered our food shortly after realized the mistake and returned to the table. Rather than letting me know that they'd bring out my fries, he promptly reached over me and onto my plate to remove the bowl of rice and later return with my fries. Now, of course, I'm not one to be hung up on something I didn't order being taken away from my table, but reaching over and onto my plate just is not proper etiquette.  I'd realized we were running out of water at my table and figured, since he was there, I would ask that we had another bottle brought out. I was promptly informed that I would have to ask my waitress for that, and he hustled off. Again, questionable professionalism, as he could have just as easily acknowledged the request and let our server know.  Shortly after, our fries were brought out and we got our water refills. Ready to eat, I dug into my K-Mac and fries. The K-Mac itself left much to be desired, and struck me more as a gimmick burger than a well thought out recipe. The sauce was great, but the kimchi just did not vibe well with the patties, the carrots were a strange addition, as well. It's not that it was terrible, it just wasn't very good.  To summarize? Great atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, gimmicky food and less than pleasant/professional kitchen staff. Certainly not worth the nearly $70 tab.",
