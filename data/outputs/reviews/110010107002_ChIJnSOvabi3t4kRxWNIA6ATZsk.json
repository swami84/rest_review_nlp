Ordered drinks and 2 burgers right off the bat. One out of two drinks was wrong, but we let it go. Over an hour later the lights were flashed indicating last call, and we were told at that time that there were no burgers left. Also that each small drink was $14 each. We ended up going to a Wawa, should have just done that in the first place. Will absolutely never go there again.",

My fiance found this place because we both love italian food so he took me here for my birthday.  The wait staff, at least most of them, speak Italian, we got to meet a lovely young lady, she served us, with, exceptional care, and she was just AMAZING. So sorry, I lost her name, but she is from Italy, so friendly and we fell in love with her! We travel to Hong Kong quite a bit, we will always make it a point to visit this restaurant when we are in Hong Kong.  Try the Eggplant parmigiana. EVERYTHING they make is EXCEPTIONAL!

Their house \"margarita\" is just a cup filled most of the way with rail liquor and then a splash of orange juice on top... nothing else.

It runs Monday \u2013 Friday until 8 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday until 6 p.m. No food is included in the happy hour specials, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend coming here for food anyways. I ordered the wings \u2013 you get only about 6-7 wings and they are the smallest wings I\u2019ve ever encountered, smaller than my pinky finger (see photos)! The bartenders and staff are very friendly and attentive (if you sit at tables in the bar area, the staff will come take your order and even remind you when happy hour is nearing its end). They really focus on good customer service. As for the layout, the main bar is on the lower level and features a lot of blue lights strung from the ceiling (see photos). There is a section towards the back with booths and TVs. It can get loud and crowded fast, so get there a little early and snag a high-table in the main bar area. It\u2019s not a classy place, but for the happy hour drink prices, you can\u2019t beat it anywhere in the Dupont Circle area.",

We had called ahead to see if it was okay to bring 20+ people on a Sunday evening and were told sure, and had the back room reserved. When we got there, the single bartender was totally overwhelmed and apparently didn't know we were coming? We took up 4 or 5 tables and it took 90 minutes from ordering to getting our drinks, let alone food. Most of us gave up and left at that point, and it still took another half hour to get our checks and cards back. Then they tried to charge for the food they didn't make in the two hours we'd been there. Every 30 minutes or so the bartender would come by with another tables drinks, with the ice half melted, so when some of tried to go to the bar to order with cash (they still had our cards) they refused to pour a drink or take our money. The first few times people complained to the manager he actually said he couldn't help. Couldn't even pour a drink and wouldn't help the poor over worked bartender carry a tray. Absolutely clueless.",

So we asked to speak to managermet since the server was unwilling to take them back. The manager was just as rude, and unwelcoming as the sever. So to avoid the commotion and their unwillingness to provide us with a solution, I just went ahead and paid for the drinks. The manager still continued to patronized myself and my friends. Sh snatched  the empty glasses from our table and made sly remarks. I\u2019d informed her they\u2019d been paid for since her nor her staff was willing to rectify the situation. She then proceeded to go for security to come to our table, to again patronize and intimidate us more. We left the establishment with such disgust, and shock to know that an establishment could hire employees like this. But what was reassuring was that the owners took my complaint seriously and reached back out to me. For that and, that reason only did I then feel like an appreciated customer.",

        "caption": "So I wanted to find a spot within walking distance from the hotel I was at to see the Cavs game and have some wangsssss and drankssss. I searched Sports bars and saw this place. I bookmarked it based on reviews and pictures I saw which I approved.  We entered the establishment after 8:00PM on a Friday and I was expecting a wait but we were seated right away in the lounge area straight ahead up a small flight of stairs. (Yesssss #MichaelJordanFistPump). First observations on other tables while we were being seated was that the atmosphere was amazing, loud and upbeat music rocking the joint. That was a good or bad thing depending how you look at things but for me this was a great thing which was what I expected per reviews I read. Our waitress was cool and very friendly. Now as we are seated I noticed that the lounge area seating can hold parties of up to 6 people easy with wide seating. Also you have plenty of privacy per booth in the lounge area to talk amongst yourselves and not worry about disturbing other around you. Our waiter was very helpful and suggesting certain drinks off the menu.  Another observation was the diversity of the customers sitting down and everyone had smiles throughout the restaurant and living it up. The customer service here was solid and the ambiance was electrifying.  - Appetizer/Sides: 4 out of 5 Stars  \"Old Bay Flavored Wings\" I am a huge Old Bay Season fan so when I saw this on the menu I didnt even blink to order and try these wings. They were soooooooooooooooo good if you are a n old bay season this is a must order. It was a tad bit strong on the seasoning but that worked fine for me but may be a little bit much for others so just a heads up there. She asked what dressing I wanted for the wings and I said Ranch but they came with Blue Cheese crumbs at the bottom which was not cool because I hate blue cheese lol. .5 star deducted due to the fact they do not make you aware of that especially if you say you dont want the blue cheese dressing with the wings that should be a hint.  \"Asian Flavored Wings\" The wings were good but didn't blow you away. The sauce was simple and lacked real pop and flavor to stand out for me and I requested no blue cheese crumbs this time which the waitress made sure she would have them take care of that.Solid wing but nothing mind blowing.  Overall the wings were good and I would definitely order them again I was too stuffed to try other wings options.  - Drinks: 4.5 out of 5 Stars  \"Captain Nemo\" Vodka, Peach Schnapps, Blue Curaco, Creme De Cassis, Pineapple, Sour, Sprite. It doesn't come off as strong but catches up with you later  \"Steam Engine\" Vodka, Malibu, Sweet Fruit Liqueur, Juice Blend. Very Sexy drink I approve worth ordering  \"Patron Shot\" Patron got the stamp of approval but I didnt drink it lol  Overall this place slightly exceeded my expectations in regarding to vibe and atmosphere which was great. The music played was more hip hop that was currently hot in the streets. Great place for good drinks and fun club like atmosphere to an extent. Decent size bar area to get your drink on and I believe they have numerous happy hour options at various times to get saucy before you leave for the drinkers out there. The ambiance alone and overall experience was worth coming here.  Tips:  1. For major sports fans that get caught by the sports bar label they only show games that are on ESPN, TNT etc.. they do not have NBA League pass so we could not see the Cavs game. So for those looking to see all games played that will not be the case.  2. Pay attention to the happy hour times because they have a happy hour in the late evening as well into the night.  3. The Food menu is very limited so do not come if you are more of food person as opposed to drinking because you will be disappointed",

Music playing, customers conversing, and beautiful lighting. I went around 5pm on a Saturday and it surprised me to say the least how many people were in the bar. Sat down up stairs next to a great energetic couple who were comfortable enough to pick up a banter with my group. After that, things kind of went downhill. The servers have to work the upstairs and downstairs, which led to a little gap in return service. In a party of six, the food came out separately despite everyone placing their orders at the same time. We had to retrieve The server multiple times for the orders being incorrect. The food itself was not great. Edible to provide substance (except the wings; see pictures) but not nearly as good as it could have been.",

The food is great (how can tater tots taste so good, and the wings are delicious too), and the drinks are strong. The bartenders make you feel at home, and Sean was a dream to work with regarding getting my reservation set-up. Everyone was SUPER attentive, and I will definitely be back. My only con for the night was the new DJ that made his debut there. We had to text him songs we wanted to hear. Hopefully, I won't have to work so hard next time, as 1831 is known to have great music! See you guys soon!",

We are a collective of artists located in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia metropolitan area. This past weekend we hosted a release party for our very first musical EP \u201cNo Seats.\u201d 1831 Bar & Lounge was happy to provide us access to their venue for our event. We set up a stage, microphones, speakers and of course a DJ. We were able to connect our equipment to their sound system which provided quality sound throughout the whole venue. Also, to help create the intimate ambiance that we desired for our guests; televisions and projector screens were made available to us so that we could display our visuals and graphics throughout the entire night.  This event was very busy! We had over 130 guests at his event and the bar & kitchen staff maintained a sense of urgency and provided exemplary service for the entire time we were there. The food was delicious and the drinks were awesome! People ordered wings, nachos, and burgers all night!  1831 Bar & Lounge is a sexy place. There is a detailed mural on the wall, blue lighting on the ceiling as well as under the bar and on different areas on the wall. There was a decent balance of seating as well as open space for everyone to dance and enjoy themselves.  The owners were very polite, hospitable, and catering to us and all of our guests that attended our party. Bartenders were friendly and outgoing. Sean, the manager, made sure that we didn\u2019t have anything to worry about. He made us feel right at home.  This past weekend was phenomenal. We would definitely recommend 1831 to anyone looking for a good time!  -The Aim Society",

It was great to have the space up the stairs at the back, and all the technology worked perfectly - I heard how long it took to be able to wire it so that the different screens showed different things, so thank you!  I am very pleased to say that we raised just over $1000 for our charities, and so each will be getting over $500 which should be able to have a really positive impact, given that their operating costs are so low.  So thank you again for collaborating with us on this, and for making it run so smoothly.  Will, Georgetown Refugee Action",

I've even heard people who don't drink go in for their wings alone. I have officially experienced bar food like never before. I want the recipe for the spice they add to their complimentary popcorn and now if my caesar salad does not have grilled romaine lettuce, well then you can just take it back. The ambiance is cool, spacious and comfortable for anyone. They have two levels perfect for small to large sized groups. I have already looked into renting out the top level for my Birthday and they offered to throw in a DJ. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I am an 1831 believer!!",
