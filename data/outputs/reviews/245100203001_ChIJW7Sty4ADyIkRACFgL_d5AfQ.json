The service was fantastic, great atmosphere and best of all, the food was incredible!  We were provided with a complimentary glass of wine and starter papadums, and each entree was served with a free (and large) serving of rice. We ordered samosas for starters, then the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Korma for entrees; superb. The serving sizes were well and truly large enough for the two of us, with leftovers to spare, and the eventual cost was cheaper than a standard bar dinner.  We have recommended this to our entire network in Baltimore and as we live locally in Fells Point, we will certainly be visiting again! Definitely recommend for anyone looking for great food at a good price, with excellent service; support local!",

While some may prefer heat, my wife said that this was her favorite Indian food ever.  She was happy that there was a lot of flavor without being too spicy.  The cost for our daughters; 12 and 7 was very generous!  Naan was available on the buffet, but Darbar delivered fresh plain and garlic naan to our table. Andrew ordered take out for his fiance.  Later that evening he sent a text saying that she enjoyed her lunch very much and there was enough for the two of them to share for supper. Totally recommend Darbar anyone wanting to try Indian food for the first time and for families with a range of spicy hot tolerance. Great flavor, generous portions and nice casual atmosphere.",

The chicken didn't taste like it had time to absorb the spices. And the gravy itself tasted mediocre. Nowhere close to an authentic Indian dish. Furthermore, they didn't bother to include napkins or forks/spoons. Having had great Indian food in DC, I rate this one 2 out of ten. I will stick to Thai next time I am in Baltimore, unless someone can suggest an really authentic Indian joint in Baltimore.",

I had been to this restaurant for lunch in the past (highly recommend the all-you-can-eat Buffett), but I was excited to see what the dinner experience was like! Safe to say I was NOT disappointed!!! The service was EXCEPTIONAL. It was undeniably some of the best service I've ever received! Wish I had gotten his name. But after providing us with complimentary wine, we dined on delicious samosa chaat and garlic naan bread. Our main courses were the tikka masala (I'm still new to Indian cuisine) and chicken xacuti (spicy and flavorful). I seriously am just sitting at home beaming about the whole experience. I think the restaurant recently switched hands, the owner being our waiter's brother. Although I'm not sure how Darbar was before, I sure do love it now!!",

The environment is classier than I expected; double table clothes, water goblets, and candle lit table. But it was a welcome feature! The food was great, and the spice level was on point for my dish; rate spice from 1-10. We ordered chicken vindaloo and chicken tikka masala. Both dishes were fantastic but we both preferred the chicken vindaloo because of the spice. We also ordered plain naan, which paired well with the entrees. We didn't order an alcoholic beverage, but they have a wide variety of beer and wine. We would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a unique dining experience with great food.",

However, we had ordered delivery because could not go pick up the food ourselves. She did not offer to send a delivery of the missing dish, we had to ask that they send it to us. The food was fantastic, but it was very frustrating trying to discuss our missing food order with the staff.",

        "caption": "I came here on the recommendations of my coworkers for the lunch buffet; it's a decently-reviewed local Indian restaurant not far from the office, what's not to like? Quite a bit apparently. Pull up to the restaurant and you're greeted by a small, non-assuming restaurant not akin to to a hole-in-the-wall. We walked inside, were promptly seated at a table, and dug into the buffet. Being Punjabi and having dined at Indian restaurants across the world, I typically have very high expectations for 1) the authenticity of the dishes 2) the preparation of the curries and 3) the quality of the tandoori dishes/breads. Given this, I lowered my expectations for Darbar-- sadly, they were still not met.  You've got a buffet that's on the small side, expect 5-7 main dishes, rice, and your usual accompaniments. A lot of the vegetarian dishes were made with cheaper substitute ingredients. For example, you've got mushroom kadai instead of paneer kadai (really?). The naan is not served alongside the buffet-- a huge drawback. Instead, small baskets of naan are brought to your table. We received 3 naans total (not nearly enough for 3 guests during a buffet). Not once did the serving staff or manager bring any more baskets. No guest should have to ask for more naan in a bottomless buffet--period. See my review of dishes below: ---- Things I Liked: Gulab Jamun - You can't really mess up Gulab Jamun, especially when it's store-bought like the jamun here.  Rasmalai- Ditto above.  Naan - The naan was just fine, but not nearly as fluffy and tandoorlike as it should be. 3/5  Things I Disliked: Vegetable Samosa - The veggie \"samosas\" in the buffet were NOT samosas. Instead, they were frozen veggie and potato patties that were fried and served in the buffet. These were not made in-house either, as I instantly recognized the frozen foods brand from which they were bought (I use them at home and they're available in Indian stores everywhere). Tasteless and overcooked, these patties were very poor. 1/5  Saag Spinach - Palak paneer (or saag) is a difficult dish to screw up. You've got cooked spinach, usually with some cream thrown in, and a base of tomatoes, onions, garlic, and ginger. This palak was bland and flavorless-- even paneer (if there was any) wouldn't help this dish. 2/5  Chicken Tikka Masala - Many people confuse butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Butter chickenis meant to be light and sweet, while chicken tikka should be more tart and spicy. Unfortunately, I'm not sure Darbar's chicken tikka falls in either camp. The dish was too sweet to be chicken tikka but not nearly creamy enough to be butter chicken. Tough pieces of overcooked chicken dominate this dish with its watery curry. 2/5  Dal Makhani - With far too many lentils packed into this dish, the taste simply does not shine through. There is no evidence of a tomato, onion, garlic, and ginger base (tadka) and the dish lacks any buttery creaminess (makhan = butter/cream). 2/5  Tandoori Chicken - Typical of poor Indian restaurants, this chicken was far too dry and devoid of flavor. This is because the chicken had obviously been sitting in the buffet dishes for some time, being constantly heated and dried. The tandoori flavors simply did not shine past the initial bite of dry chicken. 2/5  I would not recommend Darbar; it might be okay for a quick fix but simply lacks the authenticity and careful preparation of dishes. The spices simply do not reveal themselves in any dish neither is the service or atmosphere worth nothing. While not in Baltimore, I would recommend the following Indian restaurants instead:  Royal Taj (Elkridge, MD off of 175 by Costco) Ananda (Fulton, MD off of 216 by Maple Lawn) Chutney (Columbia, MD off of Snowden River Pkwy) Rasika (2 locations in Washington, DC.) Indigo (H St, Washington, DC.)",
