However, on February 16, 2021, I placed an order for (Beef Kimchi Rice) for pickup through the Ritual app. The app stated my food would be ready at 3:43 pm. I arrived there a few minutes early and my order was ready and handed to me. I didn\u2019t check my food. When I got home (15 min drive). I opened the container and was mortified. The meat was barely lukewarm (it was dry) and there was no kimchi in sight. Nothing. No green onions. The dumplings were tough and the sauce must\u2019ve been left in the pot. If at the end of the day, Blossom Tree wasn\u2019t able to serve me what I paid for, a hot meal worth eating they should\u2019ve denied the order. The food was awful. I won\u2019t be going back to Blossom Tree for a long time if at all. This has left a bad tast toward this restaurant. A total waste of my time, energy and money",

One of my favorite lunch spots, and honestly it's everyone else's too because if you go between the prime hours of 11:30 am and 1 pm, it's extra poppin. And the location is pretty small, so if you're claustrophobic, you're gonna have to be okay with being shoulder to shoulder with people for a couple minutes while waiting on your food (which probably won't be more than 15 minutes their chefs put meals out at supersonic speeds)  My go - to is typically a beef of pork bibimbap bowl accompanied by kimchi and dumplings or soup. It's rice and salad and deliciously seasoned protein that'll keep you coming back for more on the regular.  I've also tried their tacos and crispy chicken curry bowl which are great as well, but nothing is topping the bibimbap section of the menu.",

These were good, but I\u2019d order another shrimp or fish taco instead of getting the dumplings.  1x Fish (Tilapia) Taco *this taco was my top favorite. The spice was perfect and the crunch was just perfect. Loved the flavor!  1x Pork Bullgogi Taco *this taco was good, but was a tad spicy for me, so not my number one, but the one to get if you love more than mild spicy Pork Bullgogi.  Packaging was nice and delivery was good using Uber Eats.  Tacos are pictured.",

Cue the house to the rescue! It's a small Asian fusion restaurant in North Beach with savory dishes including (what we ordered), shrimp dumplings, grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy sauce and warm wasabi noodles with grilled salmon. Our eyes widened with disbelief at each plate that came out of the kitchen to be delivered to guests seated around us. Everything smelled great and was plated beautifully. I had to restrain myself from ordering the crab cakes as well because although I felt full I was dying to taste them. The staff were also very friendly, kind and attentive which added to our already pleasant experience.",

I'd be willing to give Blossom Tree one more go, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  If you like Asian food adventures, feel free to check this place out; I was just looking for authenticity and didn't find it.  --  Galbi bibimbap with spicy sauce: The girl who took my order told me the spicy sauce is the more authentic option (usually you don't get a choice of sauces in Korea), so that's what I got.  The sauce did remind me of the real thing, and the galbi meat sort of reminded me of the real thing, but that was about as close as the similarities got.  I admit I'm being super picky here, but bibimbap is supposed to come in a bowl, not on a plate.  There was too much sauce, too much meat, and not enough rice.  The vegetables didn't mesh well with the dish, either.  Korean dumplings: They tasted and felt like they'd been frozen before and that they had been reheated a long time before they made it to my plate.  I think I ate two out of the three I'd been given.  I wasn't impressed.  Sweet potato: My first bite was nice.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  But sweet sauce over the potatoes quickly became too much for me, though.  I ate about half of my portion.  --  Very friendly service.  Casual atmosphere.  I think I'll give it one more shot, but with the amazing Dua just down the street, I don't know when I'll be making the decision to visit Blossom Tree again.",

The food ranged from good to awesome.  Food: I had the shrimp bibimbap (brown rice) with 2 sides (sweet potatoes and kimchee rice). . . .  Shrimp bibimbap - good; the shrimp was very flavorful but the combo of brown rice (my choice) with uncooked vegetables made the dish a bit plain at first. But once paired with any of their sauces it was really good. The sweet potatoes - tasty; almost like candied wedges.  Kimchee rice - delicious; gets its own line since it was awesome.  Overall, really great experience.",

        "caption": "While staying in DT Atlanta, and in need of takeout, preferably good takeout, we found Blossom Tree. We placed our order online as you cannot order by phone. My husband walked the two blocks over and was back in less time than I expected since the food was ready right on time. We opened the takeout right away, less than 15 minutes, everything was hot, crispy, and fresh.  I ordered the pork bibimbap with mild sauce (very mild, hot was described as siracha). There was an ample portion of lean tender pork, the greens were fresh, and the rice was recently steamed (dried out rice is a pet peeve). Most dishes come with two sides, I ordered the dumplings (surprisingly crispy and good proportion of meat to wrapper) and the kimchi (very mild).  Husband ordered the beef rice. Based on the rate of inhalation, it was a hit.  Wish we would have enjoyed the meal in the restaurant but we were incredibly pleased with the choice!",

The lunch line can be incredibly long. It's hard to find seating too. I ended up eating outside at Woodruff Park because of this. Also, the way that they communicate orders that are ready for pickup is inefficient. The environment itself it very loud most of the time, so screaming a number isn't the best choice. There's a bit of a language barrier here so that doesn't help either. I would recommend that they digitize the way they communicate completed orders. Nonetheless, go here if you are looking for something in this realm of things that's authentic.",

Since the closing of Pixel's Cafe I have been in need of a Korean lunch fix.  Looks like I have been lucky enough to find it!  Food:  I ordered the Bulgogi/rice plate with dumplings and sweet potatoes on the side.  The bulgogi was very thinly sliced beef (almost shredded like) with onions, scallions, and mushroom.  There is an enormous proportion of meat that tops the white rice.  It was flavorful and savory compared to the sweetness offered at Pixel's.  None the less I was pleased.  The dumplings were a bit too greasy for my liking but they were nicely flavored.  The sweet potatoes as so many other reviews have spoke about are awesome.  Perfectly cooked then drenched in a sweet sauce.  This place had mega yum factor for me.  Service:  I went during the lunch hour so the place was pretty crowded but we managed to get a seat (surprisingly).  You walk up to the counter, place your order then wait to be called or they will bring it to you.  The place was so busy I hardly noticed the service.  It was more of a \"Wam, Bam, Thank You Ma'am\" type setting.  Our food was ready pretty quickly and staff is helpful in explaining the menu.  I have no real complains because it was very informal.  That being said there is no need to speak about atmosphere.  There are tables and chairs and lots of people.  :)  Will I be a frequent customer? Hell yes!",
