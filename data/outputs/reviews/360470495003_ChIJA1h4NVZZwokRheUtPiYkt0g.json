During such difficult times for all small businesses and restaurants, I am blown away by the service here. Thank you so much!",

After so many good reviews I was looking forward to going but while the service was good I felt that this restaurant was extremely over priced for what we got.  First we were given stale bread at our table and the olive oil for dipping was of poor quality and funky tasting.  I don't recall ever going to an Italian restaurant and being served bad bread and olive oil.  This is something that never happens.  The second thing was that my sister in law and I ordered the shrimp appetizer which we thought we would share only to be served ONE prawn on a plate for around $6 and this wasn't a large prawn.  Once you removed the head it was an average sized shirmp at best.  To add to this insult it was slightly over cooked and had a stong shrimpy flavor like it was less than fresh.   The  pasta was good but nothing amazing and the panna cotta dessert was the only thing that saved the meal for me, otherwise I would have given this restaurant one star.   For two people this meal was well over $100 and I don't feel that it was worth the cost.  We won't be back.",

When I stepped into the restaurant with my family it looked clean and actually very nice and accomadting so I had high expectations, mind you I live about 30min away from here so I was expecting alot based on the reviews. I honestly have no idea on why this place would have 5 stars I was shocked that it did. When our server came to seat us she looked kind of tipsy which I didnt pay mind to at the moment. The menus were just regular paper menus and very few options to choose from. Our server returned and explained some things on the menu which I asked her to do so, yet she never advised that the appetizers were served cold and once we ordered the main dishes which my brother ordered pork she never asked if he wanted the meat well done or medium nothing. The server, kitchen staff and bartenders were all drinking wine at plain sight of the customers. The food was not good to tell u the least me my mother and I left with stomach aches, the drinks are overpriced as well as the food. Honestly the restaurant just looks nice because in regards to food and drinks its just bad. Service isnt bad when your being served by tipsy staff members I mean really? If your going to drink don't do it so bluntly in front of the customers. I will never be returning to this place and I honestly just wanted to leave this review to advise customers to not waste their time and money because u will be disappointed. Portions are so small from food to drinks and so overpriced it's ridiculous you would have to be desperate for food to stop here to say the least, what a disappointment!",

The hostess was very friendly and welcomed us as soon as we arrived. We were seated at the bar as our table was not ready (we got there 15 mins earlier than our reservation) which gave us a chance to go through their extensive amaro collection and cocktail list. We ended up ordering the \u201cA place beyond the Alpine\u201d and \u201cOrange Ferrari\u201d (both were very good) by which time our table was ready. For appetizer we ordered the Calamari (delicious!!) and for the main course we got Agnolotti ( Seriously by far the best pasta I\u2019ve had and which I\u2019ll be dreaming about for days to come) and Gemelli Verde (fantastic!). And finally for desert we got the strawberry Panna cotta.  The service was good, the food arrived fast and everything was just excellent. This place is a real gem. Also I believe they have Jazz performances on Sundays (which sadly we didn\u2019t know about when we made our reservation on a Saturday). We will definitely come",

Food took 2 hours to start arriving and didn\u2019t even all come in the end. We had to keep reminding them to bring our drinks and food over. Finally asked to speak to the manager and the waiter\u2019s response was \u201cshe\u2019s busy\u201d. Manager couldn\u2019t even come over to help and make amends. We spent almost 700$ on food and drinks and this is the worst service I\u2019ve ever encountered in my life in NY. When we left the manager was just sitting at bar doing nothing. DO NOT RECOMMEND",

        "caption": "TL;DR : this place is amazing and you should try it before it becomes too popular to get a seat. I had to remove some stuff here because of Google's character limits.  Let me preface this by saying I did not want to write this review. I think Yelp is generally misused by people who either want to have their server fired for a perceived slight or hope to get a free dessert. I, selfishly, hoped that I could keep Trattoria Ammazzacaffe a secret to be enjoyed by myself and as few other people as possible. That would, however, not be fair to Gary and Kelly, the duo behind this treasure, who poured their souls into creating an amazing experience or their staff who execute their vision.  I visited the restaurant for a date once before but I wanted to return and experience it again on my own. I highly recommend everyone does the same. When you walk in you are greeted and asked for your preference in seating. If you, like me, wish to enjoy your respite from the outside world you\u2019re best served to take your seat at the bar. I wrote a paragraph about how beautiful the bar and woodwork is but deleted it. Just go see it and touch it for yourself.  If you have an eye for this sort of thing you\u2019ll quickly notice the meticulous details that characterize Ammazzacaffe. The dining areas are connected by a service station that equal parts transparent and intimate. You will not believe the quality of food and drink that comes out of such a compact space. The backyard is perfect for Summer in Brooklyn. Oh, and the music is on point for good measure.  I strolled into the restaurant at around 8:30pm and took my seat on the corner of the bar. Kelly had mentioned before that I should come back and try the duck, she warned me that it can take over an hour but was well worth it, so I came prepared for and enjoyed a long evening.  I started off with a Negroni as I\u2019d never had one before and felt this particular bar would be a good place to try one. I was correct.  Before the first course you receive olives in an house herb oil. If you, like me, have had an aversion to olives, these olives will change your mind. If they sold their herb oil in bulk you'd probably find me trying to bathe in it, it's that good.  My first course was the pancetta. Now I\u2019ve had a lot of a pork in my day. But this was something different. If you want to know how to perfectly balance meat, fat, and crunch in your pork, ask Gary. The cherry pepper and agro-dolce bring this together for a pop of umami many chefs dream mastering of without ever achieving.  Second was the G\u00e9melli Verde. Kelly paired this perfectly with a mineral-y white wine (name escapes me) that was a real treat  A bite that includes the pasta, maitake mushrooms, goat cheese, and spinach will make you question how something this simple can taste as good as it does; until you realize that\u2019s exactly why.  For my main course, what I\u2019d made this particular journey for, I had the aged duck. You should, too. Before this evening I had only had one moment, tasting a 1994 Chateau Haut-Brion, in which the taste made me truly feel something. The ephemeral moment of skin and meat on the tongue is, in my opinion, perfect. I do not have the words to properly describe it. You may wish to close your eyes and really focus on it. I did, at least. Paired with a Syrah forward Cotes du Rhone that sang particularly well. After a few bites I felt compelled to tell Chef Gary that it was the best I've ever had. Because it is.  For dessert you should have the ricotta. If they have any left. Trust me. Just do it, okay?  I finished my evening with a single espresso and an amaro of Kelly's choosing. I could have died absolutely content with life right then and there.  Bring a date here, bring your parents here, bring your kids here. I don't care, this place will knock their socks off.  Or, better yet, don\u2019t bring anyone, just yourself. Sit at the bar, turn off your phone, and pay attention. But, move quickly, before everyone else finds out.",

To start with... I am truly shocked that this place has 5 stars reviews. They have accommodating and friendly staff but that\u2019s about it. My biggest disappointment was the food. To say that it was mediocre would be an understatement. I was thoroughly searching for the best place for my bday party and picked this one because of the good reviews. Well, it turned out to be a huge mistake. Portions size is ridiculously small, appetizer with 1 piece of burned prawn for $7? Like really?! Calamari app had black garlic on it which tasted odd, pancetta app (pork belly) was drown in a fatty and spicy sauce with some weird stuff on the top that tasted awfully bad. You may wonder how someone can ruin a piece of lettuce. Well, this place surely knows how to do it, again, it was drown in the sauce that was way too sour, like a mixture of expired Caesar and ranch dressings. But the number one reward in the category Suckiest Dish goes to Cacciucco Bianco which is a weird combination of a very few pieces of seafood, spicy Japanese dressing and a bunch of soggy bread floating in the broth. Charging $38 for it is a real theft. On top of that, my friend had a teeny tiny margarita for $13 which was pretty basic. And let me add that it took very looong time for the food to be delivered although the restaurant was empty. To sum up, I cannot describe how disappointed I am, picking this place for my bday celebration. I was really ashamed that I brought my friends to a restaurant with horrible food, poor portions and preposterously high prices. I hope you guys reevaluate the menu and, instead of desperate attempts to be fancy and top notch, choose simpler options with some edible dishes, not an odd mixture of incompatible ingredients that taste like a waste of money. Needless to say we left hungry and hit a spot one block away with some decent food and moderate prices.",

The staff is super polite, very accommodating and professional . We didn\u2019t have to wait to be seated, our reservation was honored in a timely fashion. However, the tables are so close together you are on a date with everyone. The music is kind of loud, and for a hipster place I was surprised for rap to be the choice. The menu is unreadable(few English words), tiny(from salads to main corse, probably about 16 items in total) out of which some were unavailable at the time. Drink service was impeccable. The food on the other hand took forever to come, and in between dishes also seamed like a lifetime. The food was bland, the portions small, not thought out. For example, three little pieces of pork belly or calamari were about $6 each. The pasta with some ground beef in it is about  $18, and had large pieces of rosemary I had to pick out because it was hard and inedible. In conclusion the place as is the staff, but some things including the food could use some improvement.",

ALL PASTAS MADE IN HOUSE, all ingredients fresh and top quality.  THE HOUSE-CURED GREEN OLIVES WERE AMAZING  (warm!). I had the Rose Gold cocktail--just a tad sour balanced by floral and herby and hint of bitter. LOVED the first white wine on the list by the glass: full but not sweet and no acid.  Loved it with the amazing SEA TROUT TARTAR, topped with roe and came with crunchy bread. I had the ***vegetarian green pasta*** soooooooo goood. Again, complex, balanced, fresh everything. My date LOVED the special pasta, a black one with seafood puttenesca. Based on how good it was, next time will definitely have to try the black risotto with seafood and the other seafood pasta on their regular menu.  DIETARY RESTRICTIONS VERY EASILY ACCOMMODATED. Many things can be served Gluten- and Dairy- Free.  We were the last customers of the night and were having such a great time we didn't even know it! WE WERE NOT RUSHED OR KICKED OUT! They even laughed with us when we realized it! :)",

I would come here all the time if you played songs with personality - I'm not picky, Roy Orbison or Miles Davis or Fleetwood Mac or Sam Cooke or any thing that doesn't sound like garbage bland yuppie pseudo-electronics.  You have the best food in the hood and I don't want to come back because of the terrible music. Hope someone reads this, and four weeks from now I give you another shot and become a regular.",

We got the Tartare and Barbabetole to start and both were exquisite, but the highlight of the night were the Torcia, Mafaldine, and Rigatone. It makes my mouth water just thinking about them. Perfectly cooked noodles and some of the richest and most wonderful flavors. I can't recommend more highly. If  you're in Willamsburg for one night only this is the place to go.",

All the pastas are housemade! We also ordered calamari skewers as apps but I say skip it and save room for pasta. Highly recommended. Go before it gets busy =)",
