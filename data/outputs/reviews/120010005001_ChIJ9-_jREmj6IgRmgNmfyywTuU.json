Customer service is also supreme, you feel like your served by family. Highly recommend!",

Most of the staff know me by name, remember that I LOVE the green sauce and give me extra every time I order, and sometimes even bring my food straight to my car right as I arrive if they see me pulling in. What more could anyone ask for?  If you're looking to eat in, they have turned a boring old parking lot into an exciting social area with great energy, fun music, and a lot of liveliness. If you're looking to take out, their online ordering is fantastic and they have never messed up an order.  I look forward to coming here as long as they're around!",

The fries, the mandocas, the empanadas, literally everything there is delectable. I look forward to ordering from them every week when they open.

They decided to stop taking bitesquad and door dash orders for the sake of delivering themselves for 5$ to increase revenue, which I understand. Except it took 2 hours and a half for my order to arrive (over an hour past the promised time). Needless to say, the food was cold and the drinks were warm. I don\u2019t think the small extra in revenue is worth sacrificing the satisfaction rates of countless customers. All in one, I hate to say this but unless they start utilizing third party delivery services again or resume pick-ups, I dont think its worth ordering from here for the time being.",

Personally the location is hard for me because I\u2019m terrified of my toddler running into the street. Follow them on Instagram as they also attend many events that is easier for me.",

Between the arepas, chicken burger, beef burger, and fried cheese balls, I have been a satisfied customer thus far and know my wonderful experiences will continue. You can also add fried cheese to menu items which is so tasty. Then you have the house sauce and the pink sauce which is a must have and you might want to double up on it. Don\u2019t miss out on this experience. Plan a date night, dinner night, or just a self-care night around getting food from here. This is one of my favorite food trucks in town.",

I got the traditional beef burger, all the way, with the fried cheese. Phenomenal burger. something that is strange, but I feel is a very good thing, is the fact that the burgers are not actually as big as they look like they are on their social media pages. that may actually sound like a negative, but it is actually a very good thing. One of the reasons that I have not stopped by before now, was the fact that I was always concerned that the food was going to be just too much. Don't get me wrong, you get a lot of food, but it won't make you feel uncomfortable. I highly suggest if it's your first time there, make sure you ask questions about what everything is.
