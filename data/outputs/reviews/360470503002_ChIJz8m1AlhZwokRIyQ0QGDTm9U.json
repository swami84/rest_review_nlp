One of the pizzas was medium-sized and had been sloshed around the big box so much it was a mess. The soda wasn't delivered & the delivery guy acted offended and surprised when I asked about it. He said he'd bring it back and never did, even after several calls to the store & his phone - I had his number because it took him 10+mins to actually COME TO THE DOOR after calling and telling me he'd arrived, like he expected me to go out and meet him? He had to call me THREE times for a doorman-monitored building where I'm on the 2nd elevator-equipped floor. Ridiculous.  After getting no response about the small pizza and missing 2-liter I sent a complaint via the website & Twitter where I keep being told that \"upper management\" will contact me after 48hrs. So far nothing.  UPDATE: After weeks of stupid Twitter messages back and forth the manager of this location called me and offered to \"personally make another pizza and deliver it plus the soda for free\" anytime. He provided me with his number and on 4-29 I called him to order and it was taken care of. He seemed very apologetic and assured me that he would \"make it right\" and didn't want to lose a customer, etc. While I appreciate him finally making it right, I'd have to be a masochist to order from here again and take that risk. We're back on indefinite boycott. NYC has too many local pizza places to support when I have the money to do so.",

The crust isn't fresh, the toppings are sparse and low quality, the sauce is sugary sweet. Still, there's exactly one benefit Papa John's has: price. With deals on large pizzas under $10, this might be half the price of the other joints, so if money's a concern bump my rating up a couple stars.",
