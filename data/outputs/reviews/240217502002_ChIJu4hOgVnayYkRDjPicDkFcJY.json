The eggs also taste watered down and as though they've been sitting in a tray, similar to how you would find them at a hotel free breakfast.  I also ordered the macaroni with a desert kids meal. The macaroni is Kraft box macaroni which has been overcooked, mushy, with shredded cheese on top. Also it included some carrot sticks which were not fresh and a bag of Motts fruit snacks.  How is it you are charging 8+ per entree and 6+ a kids meal for what seems to cost you a dollar or two and a few minutes in the microwave?  Will not purchase again and I strongly discourage others from eating here.",

My kids were really comfortable in this atmosphere and the owner was super nice and accommodating. They have big spaces in the rear for groups or families.

I held a party for 35 people in the upstairs loft and had so many compliments on the space and the food. It's really hard to find a good event rental in downtown Frederick that isn't overly formal, or 'more' than what you really need. I would definitely recommend Serendipity to anyone looking to host a small event/party, it's pretty and fun, and the staff are very easy to work with! Would highly recommend!",
