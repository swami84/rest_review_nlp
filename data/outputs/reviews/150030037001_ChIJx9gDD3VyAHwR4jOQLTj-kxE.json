This time I went with an 8-month-old baby and two friends (5 and 7 years old) and a friend, but I prepared a baby high chair for the baby, and for the children (handheld and free to spare time) I asked for it from here, but I was happy to provide paper and a pen. We were able to spend dinner time comfortably with smart customer service without constant waste of smile from beginning to end. However, when I checked with the waiter that there was a diaper changing table in the bathroom, the answer was that it was on, but when I actually went there, it was not. I had to change my diaper, so I managed to force it to a place like a table in the toilet, but there was no place for my baby to sit, so I could go to the bathroom without a buggy or hug. It was a difficult technique. It may be unavoidable because it is not originally a restaurant that takes a young child in the atmosphere, but in terms of price it is a restaurant that does not drink alcohol with two adults and it is a restaurant that costs more than 200 dollars only for meals, so diapers I felt that it would be better if there was a replacement table.

We absolutely loved everything they served us and will definitely be back. The sushi was slightly better than Nobu Malibu and tasted more fresh (probably because it's Hawaii...). I will definitely come back here if I ever visit Honolulu again.",

We\u2019re from NYC, so we\u2019re used to fast service and the staff here seemed pretty aloof. It almost seemed like our servers forgot about our table. Obviously the food was amazing, but some of our platters took so long to get to us that they were not as fresh as we expected. Overall I would say this place could be top of the line if the servers took their jobs seriously.",

We went for an early dinner and decided to sit outside in the open bar and lanai area where we enjoyed almost every happy hour special and then some. Each dish was so flavorful! Even the spicy edamame was the best I've ever had. Happy Hour is 5-7pm daily and is the affordable way to dine at one of the finest restaurants in Honolulu. Thank you for the wonderful service and knowledgeable and right-on suggestions on what to order!",

Worst of all I was asked by a server at the end how the meal went and I gave my honest feedback, to which he had the gall to say that the degustations (the Honolulu tasting set was the specific one I ordered) aren't actually that good and that I should have ordered ala carte, implying it was my fault that I made the wrong choice of ordering the average meal.

So as a first timer here, we made reservation for 7pm dinner time.  We were promptly seated when we arrived. Our server (not sure of his name) greeted us and offered us the wine menu. Came back a few minutes later and asked if we needed help with anything, which we did.  He recommended some stuff but we still wasn't sure what to get.  Same goes for the dinner menu.  He explained what was what on the menu such as cold and hot food, soups, sushi, and hand rolls.  We decided to get a few drinks, their signature martini and some sake (not sure which one, forgot). As for the food we got the yellowtail jalape\u00f1o (winner), ahi uni (winner), salmon sashimi (winner), rack of lamb (winner), and pork belly (it was real soft, but was just ok). Overall food was great. As with every plate that came out, each one was explained to how it was made and what type of ingredient was used. Which as most fine dining restaurant will do the same.  No complaints here.  However our service was lack luster.  We ordered a few drinks but our waiter did not come by often to ask us if we need more drinks. We also had to ask for more water (not our waiter, but some other wait staff) a few times.  I also asked for a steak knife, cause it was hard to cut the rack of lamb with a butter knife.  So when our waiter did stop by I asked him if he had a steak knife. His answer was \"I'm not sure we have any right now, but I will check\". Ok which is fine, but he did not ever once come back and tell me that they have no knife what so ever.  Kept walking by our table and serving other tables near by us and not once mention anything to us. So we ended up just using a dull knife.  Overall for a first timer here, it wasn't a great experience. Especially if you're spending that type of money on food and service.  Food was great, service not so much.",

Recommended to share with at least one other person. - Also option to get it with snow crab for half the price. :)  He ordered: * Prime ribeye steak with 3 sauces (raddish sauce, shoyu ponzu sauce, fish flakes) + caramelized onions . - Lots of veggies (cabbage, pumpkin, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, bell pepper, cauliflower, broccoli, potato)  We shared: * Waygyu manapua - Rich and decadent. Creamy center. Slightly spicy-- watch for the bite!!  * Butter mochi dessert with icecream - You will not regret this warm, sweet, cold, mix of DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Service: - Our server was TJ and he was so awesome!!  We were unable to RSVP since they were full. Luckily, we were able to walk in and score seats at the sushi counter. Even more lucky that we got TJ as our waiter.  TJ helped us from start to end! He did a great job in reassuring my boyfriend (who is allergic to seafood) and providing excellent MEATY recommendations. :) TJ really went out of his way to provide above and beyond customer service to us.  Good food, great service, and even better company. :)",

        "caption": "When we arrived, we were immediately able to seat ourselves at a table of our choice at the covered patio.  My date had brought her dogs and it was no issue. Later, one of the waitstaff even brought water bowls for them.  When the waitstaff found out we had reservations, we were given the option to remain out on the patio for the time being as we had already ordered drinks (we had arrived at the tail end of happy hour) and appetizers.  While waiting for our order, we were offered sparkling water.  The appetizers, kurobuta andagi and Waygu manapua, did not have the expected texture associated with andagi and manapua. However, they were delicious nonetheless.  We ordered a second round, ahi poke and, our first \"hot\" dish, rock shrimp tempura with butter ponzu sauce.  As with the first, our second round of orders arrived in a short period of time.  The ahi had the firm flesh of freshness. Thinly sliced onions and a type of limu complimented the fish.  The rock shrimp tempura resembled popcorn shrimp. The shrimp was firm, the tempura batter crust light and crisp despite being already tossed with the rather savory sauce.  At this point, because of the growing chill, we asked to move to an indoor table. In a remarkably short time, our table was ready and we were escorted in. Our drinks followed us in and the inquiries about if we needed more water were frequent.  Our next orders were the kurobuta pork belly with Brussell sprouts and black cod with a miso sauce.  We had considered ordering one order each of the pork belly, but the waiter stated that the dish of 8 pieces could be an entree if accompanied with rice. I opted for a bowl of rice, my date did not.  The pieces of pork belly were savory, not greasy. The sprouts were tender and mild in flavor.  The black cod was slightly oily, but flaked readily.  At this point, we requested the dessert menu and coffee.  My date ordered the bento box, which arrived in an actual lacquered wooden box. Props for presentation there. The gelato was cold, smooth, and melted away quickly, leaving an aftertaste of matcha on the tongue.  I ordered the lemon crunch, which was a surprising variety of tastes and textures. The lemon custard was surprisingly sweet. The raspberry gelato tart and refreshing. The crunch seemed to have bits of dried sugared fruit. And nestled in the topping of whipped cream and chocolate shavings was a sugared ginger cookie.  Overall, our experience with the food and the service was an excellent one. Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth it. Would return, would recommend to family and friends.",

My vegetable sushi was dry even after soaking it in as much soy sauce as one could stand. My reccomended eggplant miso was mushy and flavorless and I was charged $5 to add flavor to it. I loved my husband's mushroom tempura; we laughed at how many times multiple bus boys came to pick it up before we finished all of it. I also liked that the food came quickly and the ambiance was nice. 2 stars because food taste and a decent waiter was lacking.",

There is so much to choose from and if you have a group of 6 or 8 you'll get to experience so much more. With just the two of us we will need to come back multiple times to work through all the dishes we weren't able to try this time. Rest assured, we'll be back!",

The $120 signature tasting menu included fish that tasted fishy (one day old raw fish), beef that didn\u2019t taste fresh either, and \u2018shave ice\u2019 for dessert \ud83d\ude44Yikes. Water & sugar syrup for dessert? Fruit would have been more exciting. My taste buds were overly underspoiled. A disappointing experience. I asked for another dessert and they created the ONLY thing that made me go \u2018mmm\u2019 in the end (that accommodation earned them an extra star), but had to let me know this would be a one time exception only, and that dessert was complimentary. So the $120 was basically just for the rest of the menu that I could have done better myself. I\u2019m not coming back. I also had to ask for my green tea 3 times. That\u2019s a record. The servers were shouting to each other in the back (close to our seating), it was displeasing to feel that rush of noise penetrate the scull on top of an already displeasing experience. I could make better food than what I had here. The surroundings are nice though, beautiful interior design! Go to Hoku\u2019s instead; you\u2019ll pay the same, and not go home disappointed.",

Definitely defines a category of restaurant that perhaps it started or at the very least made the biggest impact of any in the segment.  Shrimp appetizer, yellowtail jalape\u00f1o, sashimi salad, black cod, etc... all standbys. Haven\u2019t had the Kobe beef in a while but that used to be phenomenal as well. Tried the steak cut into strips to share this visit, definitely enjoyable and good if you want just a taste of beef like the Kobe was.  A bit out of the way in Honolulu but I guess if you\u2019re going to Nobu you\u2019re not going to mind the extra time getting there.",

We know Nobu and cannot believe a restaurant under his acclaimed name could be so poor. The manager was not helpful at all and had no widespread knowlegde of the dishes.  We were told we had to order 6 oz of Wagyu and that it would be completely plain which we were anticipating because of how amazing it is in LA - well we probably ate 2 oz worth due to how unflavorful and stale it was. The sashimi was served with skin on and all tasted like it went bad. All in all horrible experience if you've never been to a Nobu before and want to go for the \"notoriety\" of the restaurant then do so but know that if you want quality I would go elsewhere.

Lobster was one of the courses and it was inedible. Like chewing rubber. The other 8 dishes were mediocre at best. Some completely flavorless. Overall, the experience was not worth the near $600. I will absolutely go back to Nobu in other cities, but never again in Honolulu. The chef did send a complimentary dish to make up for the lobster, which actually was the best one of all. So I certainly appreciate that. If this was a $150 dinner, it may have earned them an extra star, but in this case, 2 is a fair evaluation for my experience. I will give them a 5 star rating on presentation, but that unfortunately did not follow up with pleasant tastings. The wait staff were very attentive and kind.",

We wanted to celebrate birthdays for two of us and ordered omakase for the entire group plus drinks and expensive sake.  Total bill was $1200.  Very underwhelming for the price paid.  We've eaten in many fine restaurants throughout the world including other Nobu locations.  Their brand has certainly gotten diluted and is no longer the unique experience they once were famous for.  The dishes weren't that unique or plentiful.  Their omakase cost $160 per person for 8 dishes. The wagu beef dish was the best of the group but hardly worth the price.  Next dish was a pretty typical cold soba dish we could find at a conventional $20 meal.  Service was ok but uninspired, no excitement or passion in their delivery.  For $300 per person, we expect a much higher quality and offering.  All in all, over priced and over hyped.",

The first course was already the best and everything went downhill after. For $160 omakase, my friends who ordered a la carte with their signature dishes had better food than what was supposed to be the best selections from the chef. Just to name a few of the disappointments: the chives on the seared salmon was old, the dressing on the amber jack was over powering, and the wagyu was chewy. They sure know how to piss you off further though, because we got lava cake which anyone could make any day at home or from any franchise restaurant. I have never been so pissed after an omakase experience and I hope no one makes the same mistake and have to end a meal with such feelings. Please see photos.",

The service was a definite miss, especially for the price point of the restaurant.  The table was cleared slowly and sloppily between courses. Our drinks languished empty. Come desert, my wife had her teapot top open to signal for more hot water and the waiter took the teapot never returning it. When my wife asked the waiter then went into a long digression that didn't culminate in \"Sorry let me grab you some more tea.\"  This ended our otherwise OK meal on a sour note. Then to top of the evening, the waiter kindly circled the gratuity guide which happened to run from 18% - 22% which was a bit humorous since even by US standards the service we received was at best 15%.  I certainly hope the restaurant improves, but I can't recommend them at this time.",

Still, I thought its Christmas Eve so treat yourself!  Well $93 later (including tip) I had eaten a Nigiri roll which was no bigger round than my thumb and was supposed to have unagi (freshwater eel) in it but somehow it got lost in the cucumber for $14 and a small piece of black cod..  delicious yes but at $39 was at least $10 overpriced add in a $14 drink and a bowl of rice and wham bam youre out over $70...add in the tip and its up to over $90.  I have eaten lots of Japanese food in the last 40 years in the LA area and other places and its usually not cheap but this place was just not satisfying.  I couldnt help but notice that there were no Asians in sight other than the wait staff either.  Never a \"good sign\" in an Asian restaurant!",

We even stopped the first two times in hopes of someone coming out of the cracks to aid in our journey. Once inside, we were greeted by a very young and unprofessional hostess staff. Once seated, the waitress asked us if we wanted drinks. She then waited on the table next to us as. She left then came back to the table next to us and started explaining the menu to the two ladies. We were then approached by a waiter who asked if we wanted drinks. After explaining to him that we had already been waited on, he explained that he would be waiting on us. The menu was explained to us from the top priced item, then a very small trickle as to what else was available. Of which were equally priced. I expressed my frustration with no real feedback. We came to the restaurant for sushi and heard how amazing it was. After researching the restaurant I realized the founder was a sushi chef and raved about how important it was to bring his expertise into a market that was saturated and took great pride in what he could produce with credentials added. Ummm... The sushi was much of what one would expect to purchase in a prepackaged selection of sushi in a grocery store chain. Although the hot and spicy seafood soup was stellar and satisfying. The waiter was an amateur in handling the situation with nothing more than a deer in the headlights response. Paid our bill with a substantial tip for the mere fact of morale. Two thumbs down.",

For starters, we had the Nobu tacos, they were just okay, sort of bland; nothing too special to write home about.  My boyfriend had the omakase and I ordered a few extra items from the menu. None of the dishes really stood out to me, besides the rock shrimp. I enjoyed the presentation more than the meal, sadly.  The ambiance was nice, but I'm not sure I'd come again next time I'm on the island. Going to Morimoto instead ;)",

Prior to our dinner reservations at the Nobu, we actually wanted to dine at Alan Wong's Restaurant, but unfortunately, we were told by the RH concierge that the Alan Wong's Restaurant were fully booked, therefore, we decided to dine at Nobu knowing the restaurant is also one of President Obama's favorites and we wanted to give it a try.  While the Nobu was indeed quite trendy and modern, with some freshly made cuisines, namely, seafood cerviche and new style salmon for appetizers, black cod miso, duck breast and assortment of sushi plus some single orders of sashimis, as recommended by our waiter, but I found the serving size a little disconcerting \u2013 simply put, portions were just too small. In addition, the service was not very Hawaiian, everything was rushed, and one of my relatives needed to chase down the waiter a few times just to get refills for her soda.  Overall, I would say the serving size and the level of service based on dollar-value of the meal were disappointing in this regard.",
