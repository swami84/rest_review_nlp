The ajumma who took our order was very warm and gave us suggestions - we know our favorites in Korean food, but she gave us new dishes to try from their large menu. As a vegetarian, I really liked the japchae and soondubu jigae (perfectly spicy), and others ordered the spicy pork ssam and fried chicken, which earned raves. The hotteok for dessert, with warm sake, was a treat - I haven't often seen it on the menu in the metro area. Will definitely go back.",

As a vegetarian, I felt like I had a lot of options because any meat was added as extra. I went with my favorite Tofu Dolsot and it was very delicious, though I feel like there could have been a better veggie to rice balance. My friend got the Soondubu with meat and as someone who is super sensitive to spiciness levels, he was able to handle it and thought it was delicious!  Overall a great experience!

It was a mixture of udon with seafood in a spicy sauce, and i was scared of the seafood being too little, but the dish came with so much seafood! the octopus was plump and thick, and it complemented the noodles well. -the pork belly, my FAVORITE! yes some pieces of the pork belly were tough, but still did not take away from how delicious it was. It came with garlic and kimchi on the side, and the pork belly was seasoned just right so it wasn't bland at all! highly recommend, and it's good to share! -the  korean fries were a really good dish to eat on the side because we ordered a peach soju also. There was kimchi, and i thought the sauce would be overwhelming, but it didn't make the fries soggy or anything. the creamy sauce went well with the spicy kimchi, and the fries were crispy if you are looking for a place to eat delicious korean food with good vibes and maybe drink a bit with friends, this is the place!!",

When I called back at 4:00 PM to confirm my reservation, I was told the restaurant wasn't taking any more reservations, but I could walk-in.  I responded I had made the reservation by email early (around 8:00 AM).  All the restaurant could say was they hadn't bothered to check the emails.  So, I give them one star for poor management response to the instructions on their own website.  I made the reservation early in the morning.  They could have figured out a way to accommodate me.  Maybe the food's really good, but the response to my reservation left a bad taste in my mouth.  That said, we went at 6:00 to find many empty tables.  We waited about 5 minutes and were seated.  Things turned positive after that.  Service was quick and very professional.  Food was delicious.  We had short ribs, KFC chicken, and Sea snails with Noodles.  All three dishes were well portioned and excellently prepared.  I'll raise my rating to 4 stars based on the actual in-restaurant experience.  Recommendation: Call if you want a reservation.  The staff's multitasking and reading chats/emails might not be a priority.  Be ready to wait if you arrive much later than 7:00.  By the time we left at 7:30 the restaurant was packed and the wait line stretched onto the street.",

I tried the Makgeolli. Pretty good if you like a slightly caramel/sweet/milky rice wine. At 6%, it's easy to drink. I liked it. Also the special cup was a nice touch. My wife tried the Jinro 24, which means 24% alcohol which might be a bit much for some. 1 little bottle would be like a full bottle of wine. The food was good. Surprisingly even though we ordered some spicy dishes (Dukbokki), they did not have much heat to them. I guess I was under the impression that Korean food was spicier. Overall, it was a good experience with tubular rice cakes, tasty seafood pancakes (with a binder that I couldn't out my finger on) and traditional Bulgogi. Finally, BUL is in the heart of Adams Morgan so it's easy to continue the evening after dinner.",

I was just chilling at my cousins' house one afternoon and then nonchalantly one of them said that he'd been craving for budae jjigae (Korean army base stew).  The next thing I knew, we were in the car headed to Adam's Morgan!  We ordered watermelon soju, calamari, bulgogi with rice, bulgogi fries, corn cheese, wings and the budae jjigae.  I usually don't like alcohol but flavored soju is AMAZING... the watermelon masks the taste of alcohol so well, it ended up just tasting like watermelon juice.  The calamari came out super crunchy, the bulgogi with rice was for my adorable 6 month old niece to eat, and the wings were really crunchy and had the perfect amount of sauce covering it!   The bulgogi fries were out of this world, potatoes just seem to make something already good, great!  The fries were the perfect vehicle for the bulgogi, while the cheese held all the pieces of crispy bulgogi and other toppings together!  My cousins' have never heard of corn cheese before so of course I had to order it!  The corn cheese went really well with the korean fried chicken and the budae jjigae.  The budae jjigae really hit the spot, it had everything from spam to beans, It was really good!  The service was super friendly and all our food came out in a timely manner!  I can't wait to come back to see what else they have to offer!",

The other thing make me so mad is we order a soup, but there is a hair in the bowl, when I ask service, they ask me\" IS THAT YOUR HAIR\uff1f\" Excuse me?? I'm not a homeless! I'm a customer. They don't even say sorry or any apology to us. That's so rude. If they don't change their service, I will never go there again and I will tell all my friends don't go there anymore. Ridiculous! Horrible! Restaurant! No respect!",

I would definitely come back just for the fries.  If you have never tried Korean beer, the Kloud beer is a good one to try. It is easy to drink and is a freat addition to the meal.

With a bar and decorations to fill out a skinny space, BUL 's ambience make it a great place to bring a friend for a quick drink or sample of Korean wings before heading off for an entree somewhere else.  The tapas side of the menu seems a fun adventure, however my bibimbap was a disappointment, this from someone who loves Bulgogi. As so often happens with Korean fare, the red spicy sauce on the side usually dominated any finer flavors underneath.  @kwavooo",

Not sure what batch we got, but it wasn't a great experience considering all I heard about the place. You have to have some kind of warnibg label about foods people could be allergic to. Not sure if everything is fried in peanut oil which is why I got sick too or if this was a bad batch. Either way, won't be making a return here.",

We tried to make a reservation, but it turns out we didn't need one on a Thursday night at 8PM.  After dining at Bul, we give it a 4-star rating. Here's why:  One star: For location. It's in the heart of Adams Morgan, making it convenient if you're already in the area.  One star:For atmosphere. The decor inside uses exposed brick and it has a fun lay out with a second floor that over looks the first floor.  One star: For their drinks. They make a killer seasonal drink. They take a small watermelon and gut it. They then use the juice to make a watermelon soju with soju and Sprite. It's $19 but can serve two people. It's so good!  One star: For their food. It's good. My wife loved her spicy seafood yaki udon noodles and my bulgogi rice had the perfect ratio or meat, rice, and veggies.  Here's what prevented us from giving it a fifth star:  The service was a little slow and it took awhile for us to get our meals. Also, the food is great, but as a former Mount Pleasant resident, I miss Adams Express, the best Korean food in DC until they closed.",

This place was trendy and a great atmosphere, but as soon as I told the waitress that we (my husband and I) knew and really loved Korean and asked what she recommended, she pointed us in the right direction and everything we were served was amazing.  The Kimchi dumplings (steamed, not fried) were out of this world.  She said the dumplings were handmade by the owners mom and told us we had to try them, and the pork bulgogi and kimchi (we got a few other small sides as well) were great.  Highly recommended!",

Fried chicken is oddly chopped into small pieces (though still on the bone) and batter is very pepper heavy \u2014 even the naked or sweet soy varieties have a kick to them; spicy variety is tasty. Service is friendly though didn't know much about the menu. Space is deceptively large with plenty of seating.",

My main course, a pricey plate of beef short ribs, was incredibly difficult to eat. The meat itself was OK, but overcooked. Recommend spending your money elsewhere, better places abound, even along the same block.",

We ordered the chicken meatballs and the Dukbokki (spicy rice cake, and fish cake). My friend is from Korea and said the meatball was a little off but the Dukbokki was close to what they have from the vendors at home though lacking in its true spiciness.",
