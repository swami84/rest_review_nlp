        "caption": "It started bad from the time we arrived for our 5 PM reservation. We arrived at 4:55 PM to find the staff was in a meeting at the bar. Meeting broke and the staff began table preparation and the bartender began cleaning the bar. We are still in the reception area waiting to be seated. At 5:30 PM a young lady came and asked if we would like to be seated. Restaurant was 30 minutes late for it's first reservation. This was a first for me!  The dinning room  looked pleasant with the salad bar in the middle, staff smartly dressed and attentive.  Our waiter Wes greeted us and since  we have never been to the restaurant  he explained the protocol.Buffet style soup and salad, then a choice of one of six entrees and one of four dessert.  Wes was GREAT, he took our drink orders and we were off to the buffet. Choice of two soups...cream of mushroom and seafood bisque. Both soups were delicious. mixed greens or spinach for the salad. Meat tray, cheese tray, fruit, olives, crackers, humus, and four dressing choices.  NICE SO FAR RIGHT?  Then come the entrees.....Between the six people at our table we had all of the entree choices covered. Sirloin steak, Meat loaf, Snapper, Chilean Sea Bass, Chicken breast, and the Chef's Choice... Pork Chop. My daughter was performing in the show at the theater so she was a little pressed for time (ESPECIALLY AFTER WE WERE SEATED 30 Minutes after our reservation time)  but Wes assured us that there would be no problem getting her food first so she could be back stage on time.  Wes didn't lie....her food was out in a flash...( Meat Loaf ). I even commented on how fast the food was produced. I justified to myself thinking \" How long does it take to plate a meat loaf \" mash potatoes and broccoli?  Meat loaf was OK although the meat loaf at the Barrymore hotel across the street, was ten times better.  Turns out that the meat loaf was the best of class of all the meals served. Sirloin was second, Snapper, Chicken, Chilean Sea Bass, and coming in last was the \"Chefs SPECIAL\" Pork Chop.OR WOOD CHOP as it should have been advertised!  Bottom line for this restaurant:  Everything is made to look like Fine Dining however when you take the wrapper off this experience you find out that this is a slick ripoff, complete with a smooth talking car salesman/restaurant manager named Kyle. The food is precooked and reheated....you can not ask for a specific meat temperature and the fish is tough and bleeding water which indicated frozen and reheated. Lastly they automatically apply a 18% gratuity to the check and then ask for an additional gratuity. APPALLING based upon our experience.  TAKE MY CONSIDERED ADVISE....SAVE YOUR MONEY EAT AT HOME BEFORE YOU COME TO THE THEATER!  The EXPERIENCE is very similar to a BAD CRUISE LINE or most weddings.  Perhaps Executive Chef Edward Steinhoff should pay more attention to food quality. Maybe supervision over the four restaurants at the Straz Center is too big of a job for him.  Also there is no public records of his Executive Chef credentials nor any culinary training he may have graduated.  I was unaware that the Brooklyn New York Boiler Mechanic Union gave cooking lessons or for that matter owning a deli catering company qualifies a person to hold an EXECUTIVE CHEF designation?  This place has the potential to be Great however the kitchen needs to be MUCH tighter.",

Maestro's is the high-end restaurant adjacent to the Straz Center for the Performing Arts, which features premier tableside service. Chef Edward Steinhoff had created a unique menu to complement the show, and since we were planning to see \"An American in Paris\" following dinner, we knew that we'd be enjoying a fine French-inspired meal.  The restaurant was decorated for the Holidays with festive trees and colorful seasonal greenery. After being seated, our server, Alix, helped me to select a delicious bottle of 2013 Argentinian Mairena Malbec. That's not a vintage which you'll likely see in Tampa, and Alix said that they only had a few bottles left in their cellar. It was delicious, and I'm very glad that we had the chance to enjoy a bottle.  The meal starts with a visit to the Antipasti table, located in the middle of the dining room. Each night Maestro's features two different soups, and a wide variety of gourmet salads, fresh and fire-roasted vegetables, seasonal fruits, artisan cheese, charcuterie, and rustic breads and crackers. Yum!  For my main course, I ordered the Chef's Local Catch, and that turned out to be pan-seared grouper with a light lemon cream sauce, which was served with roasted vegetables and rice pilaf. Very delicious, and not too heavy.  After clearing the plates, Alix was back with the dessert tray, and I got talked into a light and flakey French pastry, layered with heavy cream and raspberries. It was delicious and extremely decadent.  For the record, the dinner is prix fixe, meaning all of the meals on the menu are offered at a fixed price, and that includes your visit to the Antipasti table, along with your choice of main course, and dessert. Wine and kisses were extra!  Candace and I really enjoyed our dinner, and thought this was the perfect opening act for a night at the theater. The hostess very kindly took a photo of us standing in front of the Christmas tree in their lobby before we dashed next door to see the show.",

        "caption": "I planned a special Holiday surprise for my adorable date, and we kicked off the evening with a meal at Maestro's restaurant in Tampa. Maestro's is the high-end restaurant adjacent to the Straz Center for the Performing Arts, which features premier tableside service. Chef Edward Steinhoff had created a unique menu to complement the show, and since we were planning to see \"An American in Paris\" following dinner, we knew that we'd be enjoying a fine French-inspired meal.  The restaurant was decorated for the Holidays with festive trees and colorful seasonal greenery. After being seated, our server, Alix, helped me to select a delicious bottle of 2013 Argentinian Mairena Malbec. That's not a vintage which you'll likely see in Tampa, and Alix said that they only had a few bottles left in their cellar. It was delicious, and I'm very glad that we had the chance to enjoy a bottle.  The meal starts with a visit to the Antipasti table, located in the middle of the dining room. Each night Maestro's features two different soups, and a wide variety of gourmet salads, fresh and fire-roasted vegetables, seasonal fruits, artisan cheese, charcuterie, and rustic breads and crackers. Yum!  For my main course, I ordered the Chef's Local Catch, and that turned out to be pan-seared grouper with a light lemon cream sauce, which was served with roasted vegetables and rice pilaf. Very delicious, and not too heavy.  After clearing the plates, Alix was back with the dessert tray, and I got talked into a light and flakey French pastry, layered with heavy cream and raspberries. It was delicious and extremely decadent.  For the record, the dinner is prix fixe, meaning all of the meals on the menu are offered at a fixed price, and that includes your visit to the Antipasti table, along with your choice of main course, and dessert. Wine and kisses were extra!  Candace and I really enjoyed our dinner, and thought this was the perfect opening act for a night at the theater. The hostess very kindly took a photo of us standing in front of the Christmas tree in their lobby before we dashed next door to see the show.",
