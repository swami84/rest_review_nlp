Barista with dark hair, usually works weekends is over the top rude and condescending to the point of eye rolling and hateful glares because you simply ordered a coffee, think \"how dare you\" attitude. Acts as if she has a high sense of ownership of the cafe. Food is very-very strange, tasteless, weird. No concept of spice or flavor. I tried a few items that were not edible, nothing is balanced with too much of one ingredient to a comical level, as if someone created it as a joke or a toddler created it with no rhyme or reason. Big and sloppy. Providing review now as I was planning to go to a cafe this morning and thinking how much I love the tables and design, the style reminds me of cafes when i lived in Montreal, but, it's just not worth rudeness and the odd tasteless food. I used to go after eating somewhere else and just have the coffee. The need a consultant with culinary training to go in as a secret shopper to provide feedback, clearly the owner has poor taste in food and there is a disconnect with the general population, especially south loop that has choice and generally average to above average palette at the least.",

It took twenty minutes for my partners oatmeal to come out (my crappy egg sandwich came out within 5 minutes). Once we got the \u201coatmeal\u201d it was awful. Literally it was more like soup (the oats were floating in sugar water) and it was half brown sugar. We each tasted it and gagged. I gave him a part of my sandwich so he could at least have something but since the sandwich wasn\u2019t great either we just got up and left. Paid 15.00 for really bad service and inedible food. Just save your money and go literally anywhere else. Oh on the bright side now we both have upset stomachs from that weird egg sandwich.",
