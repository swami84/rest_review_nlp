        "caption": "Za-Ya recently opened so I decided to give it a try. As soon as I walked in I was already impressed. It\u2019s a big open space that\u2019s well decorated and modern.  Food wise everything was a winner. The Karaage had a light and crunchy skin. The meat was very juicy. Highly recommend. I also recommend the gyoza. It was filled with beef which was different but delicious. You could tell it\u2019s made in house.  Last but not least was the ramen. I had their signature bone marrow broth ramen. Extremely rich but flavor-ful broth. The short rib was so tender and had bits of fat to add more guilty flavor. I usually don\u2019t care for the toppings but everything they added just increased the complexity and deliciousness of the flavor. Try it!",
