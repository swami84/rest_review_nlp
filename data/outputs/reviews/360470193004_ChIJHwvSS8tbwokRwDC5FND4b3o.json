The waitress advised us after we placed a order that they were closing however, the way she hovered over us every second was astonishing. I did not get a chance to finish my food until she said you want this to go. I did not get a chance to finish my drink & she placed the check at the table. I was appalled that a party of three she had the audacity to place an automatic gratitity. She made several mistakes moreover, the manager came and told us to leave because they were ready to leave. The food was okay but nothing grand and spectacular. I would advise for customers DO NOT EAT HERE. There are plenty of authentic Mexican restaurants that caters to their customer & are thankful for the service. My daugther did not even get a Happy Birthday Song & I was told she would.",
