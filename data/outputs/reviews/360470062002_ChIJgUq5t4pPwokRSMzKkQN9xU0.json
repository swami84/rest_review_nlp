The menu is fairly authentic Italian-American fare, albeit very limited (they do have a full bar and extensive wine list though!). The prices are about average, maybe slightly high, for the area/caliber of food - certainly not cheap eats but could be worse. I will say it did take close to 30 minutes for our food to be done, and rather than bringing out the bruschetta we ordered as an appetizer, they brought it out with the rest of the food. The service was the real shining star here though, the waitress we had was very friendly and attentive, always asking if we had any questions and making sure everything was to our liking.

The hot cherry peppers were nonexistent. I told the waiter that I thought it was suppose to be a double cut pork chop and he said \u201cit is it looks thick to me\u201d. He had no idea what a double cut pork chop was. After showing the waiter a picture of a double cut pork chop he acknowledged that the pork chop served did not look like a double cut pork chop. The owner came to the table and said that he checked with his wife, who is the head chef, and said that due to the inconsistent size of the racks they only serve one bone with a chop an inch and a half to two inches thick.  The owner was not very apologetic and appeared to be only interested in relaying his position. Needless to say I will not be going back anytime soon.",
