There are a couple of stalls in front of the taco truck but parking really sucks there. I parked at Ward and walked over. The good thing is, I came on Taco Tuesday so tacos were $2-$2.50. They have tons of proteins to choose from:  Pollo Carnitas Asada Barbacoa Jackfruit (only vegetarian option) Lengua  We got one of each! The tacos are served with limes, radish and some spicy veggies. The tacos were delicious. It\u2019s hard to say which was my favorite but I would have to say the lengua. The lengua chunks were tender and flavorful.  They also have 3 sauces to choose. I got the green one which is the least spicy and I could handle.  I never heard of a mulita so I got one to try. It\u2019s basically a taco and quesadilla in one. A flat fried taco. It was interesting but I think I prefer regular tacos. Definitely one of the best taco places I\u2019ve been to here.",
