The order wasn't ready when it was scheduled to be and they ignored the requested items for toppings. Most concerning was that the gluten-free crust was not gluten free! This is especially troubling as so many people  have gluten allergies. (And it can really spoil a vacation to have a reaction!) When we went to pick up, the kitchen was in chaos and our order was being burned. I'm sure they were exhausted from the previous weekend being the Super Bowl. In any case,  Jamay (manager?) was kind and tried to make it right. He gave me a cell phone number and told me to text the next day to get a refund.  When I did, I received no reply. Bottom line:  if you say you are gluten free be gluten-free.  If you say you will refund,  refund. Business is much easier and customers are much happier when you just do what you say you will do.",

When she said that she doesn\u2019t eat their when we asked for suggestions was a huge red flag but we ordered anyway. I ordered 4 pizzas and breadsticks.  Breadsticks were decent.  The Pizza......WORST PIZZA I HAVE EATEN IN MY LIFE. I would rather eat a frozen pizza from a grocery store  Pizza is very expensive.  Dough was under cooked and soft on bottom.  No crunch at all.  Pizza toppings and cheese were well done on top. It\u2019s Not possible to undercook the crust but burn the toppings and cheese. Oven settings are not correct or incompetence in the kitchen.  The most the girl would do is comp one of the pizzas.  She said that\u2019s all the owner allows her to do. $65 for bad pizza and diarrhea.  Thanks Tampa Bay pizza company.  I would have been embarrassed to serve that product.  Location downtown on Ashley drive",

After waiting for our food for nearly 50 minutes, I went to find the waiter, who had not been back to our table. He said it would be out in 4 minutes. Ten minutes later I went to find the manager who had trouble locating our ticket. When he finally found it he said it was just going in the oven. At this point it was 8:20. We finally got most of our food, but one order was missing. The last order was finally given to us 1 hour and 30 minutes after our arrival. After all of that time, the food wasn\u2019t even good. The pizzas were doughy and undercooked. The manager made very little apology, and although we have been there several times before, we will definitely not be back.",

Before I start on the details for the three stars, I will take some responsibility as I should have continued to track the amount we spent at the restaurant.  So we ate their on 10 May 2020.  I was tracking the total we spent and was prepared for it in my bank account.  But the transaction was not processed until over 4 months...24 Sep 2020 is when it cleared my bank.  So in that four months, I forgot about it and was not accounting for it and when it finally hit...it almost put me in over draft.  Who waits over four months to process transactions?

The time we went there as dine-in guests we actually sat outside our server was able to tell us all about the happy hour beers and kept our drinks full checking on us pretty regularly We got the trio of dips with the flatbread The cheeseburger slider for appetizer and a bunch of different items for our meals We were there with six people. The server was super knowledgeable about vegan and soy options I had no idea what they were talking about The wings were amazing a nice big portion good sauce good dip piping hot covered throughout man If you're a fan of wings they do it right. The thing I like about this place is they have all kinds of gourmet pizzas but then they have a entire section just of individual toppings where you can kind of add what you want and they give you each price range there's no guessing about what you're adding on to your pizza. I end up getting the pair gorgonzola pizza and adding steak to it it was amazing Even left over 4 days later it was still amazing. The meatball slider was a little odd it came out like a giant burger and we kind of cut it into pieces so everyone could try it. The kids loved their pizzas The moms love their beers and sitting outside under the shade in downtown Tampa added another level of fun for all of us.",

Outdoor seating for people watching and tv\u2019s for sport watching alike.  I have walked past this establishment quite a bit over the years and was always curious at their take on pizza. Was under the impression they served slices but to our dismay, they did not. The personal size is probably the equivalen to a large slice in NYC or even Westshore but the price isn\u2019t slice priced. Definitely, a downtown price point.  Ordered the White pizza, personal size to share as a snack. The size was cut into 4 small parts. The dough was fresh and free formed, artisanal style. Flavors were pretty great, but the overall \u201cWhite\u201d style wasn\u2019t what you would expect, if you\u2019re a fan of such flavors. Either the cook wasn\u2019t familiar with the recipe or .... frankly IDK. It may have been baked too long? Any longer and we would have had a true slice size. The dough shrunk considerably.... IMO I\u2019ll have to give it a go another time to critique precisely. It was tasty enough to scarf down & tie us over but I did expect a more true to recipe, even if it was \u201ctheir\u201d own take on a \u201cWhite\u201d style pie.  The waitstaff was as efficient as you would expect during what seemed like a full days rush. Even offered us water with our To-Go order. Not many places care enough to extend even water to smaller orders.  Bathroom was a HOT mess and hadn\u2019t been tended to for hours, it seemed. No TP and trash overflowing.  Worth the visit. Expect a hurried atmosphere when local events are happening.",

The pesto bread was delicious, and we had the large Ricky Bobby and it was incredible! The gluten-free chicken tenders were really good. My husband said they were the best he's ever had, though I found the breading to be a bit too hard for my liking. The gelato was divine! We had both the chocolate and the vanilla. It tasted like Talenti gelato. The gluten-free brownies were a bit too tacky (gooey but not like regular gooey brownies) and not quite flavorful enough. I think they use too much starch in their recipe. If you've had Dunkin Donuts gluten-free brownies, it tastes a lot like them. The Nutella dessert pizza was really good, though a bit hard to chew. Definitely best when fresh.  You seat yourself and they bring you menus and utensils. It's pretty crowded. The tables are very close together and there's no possible way the bar could be fully seated if the table behind it is too. It took only a few minutes for the server to take our order. We waited about 20 minutes between ordering and getting our food. I had asked for dessert to be brought out after dinner, but they brought it out less than 5 minutes after bringing the pizzas and chicken tenders. Still giving 5 stars though because the food more than made up for it.  Spent about $95 with tip on all of the above, plus a small gluten-free cheese pizza, a coke, and an Honest peach tea. It more than fed our family of 2 adults and 2 usually very picky kids who don't often eat much when we go out, but scarfed down their dinner this time! We took home half of each pizza and most of the Nutella dessert pizza, plus half of the large order of chicken tenders.",

She returned about 20 minutes later again with a pizza with toppings we did not order. She never apologized for the error. She stood there. When I asked her what order she actually wrote down, she said she wrote down what she thought we said. She didn\u2019t seem apologetic, instead this waitress was sort of smug and kind of like\u201doh well\u201d in the way she handled it.

Someone says there\u2019s a list we could put our name on to get seated in the order in which we arrived. I ask one of the waitstaff (blonde woman with glasses) if there\u2019s a list I could put my name down on and she said \u201cone second, but not really\u201d. She never gets back to me so I assume there\u2019s no list. So then someone else comes in and they\u2019re a party of 6. They ask another waiter about the list and it turns out there IS a list. They get to put their names ahead of my own even though my boyfriend and I had already been there standing with no clear answers for 5+ minutes. There had been TWO tables for two that were empty since we arrived that could have been for my boyfriend and I. They take the two chairs from one of those tables for the group of 6. The other table was also missing a chair but they could have EASILY grabbed another chair from another table which was not being used at the time (common sense, anyone?!) FINALLY we get seated at the table that was missing one chair because someone finally figured out that they could simply move a chair a few feet so we could be seated. This place is a mess. They were also out of ice. Really, ice? You\u2019re out of frozen water? They also were not understaffed at all, I saw at least 4 waitresses working today and this place really isn\u2019t all that big. All in all it took over 15 minutes for us to be seated despite two tables for two being available since we arrived, and waitresses had no system for seating parties, just a big disorganized mess. You need to retrain your staff or hire people who actually know something, anything, about waitering and hospitality.  Someone working here also told another party over the phone that the place was closing at 8pm tonight but the New Years hours are clearly stated on google maps as closing at 9pm.......even more confusion  Edited to add that the food took 40 minutes to come (it was just two personal pizzas), there are not nearly enough chairs for all the tables that are in here, they messed up our order switching the fresh garlic and roasted garlic on our orders, portion sizes were tiny, my sun dried tomatoes were burnt because the pizza is not actually thin crust (if it was thin crust pizza the crust would have cooked quickly enough so that my toppings didn\u2019t get completely scorched, the crust was thick.) the bathrooms are gross and unsanitary, soap dispensers were broken off of the wall and sitting on the floor. I seriously have never been to a worse establishment.",

Additionally, they told everyone (even when they were really busy) to \u201csit where they want\u201d which meant no server had a section so they were all over the restaurant. It took probably 10 minutes to get drinks and at the 30 minute mark from ordering we hadn\u2019t seen the pizza or even a salad.

When I questioned my bill they were not friendly nor thankful that I had caught the mistake and still tried to charge the higher price. Finally they let me pay the cheaper menu price... The 1 star review is due to their attitude and sneaky business practices, if they aren't honest about their prices, who knows what else they aren't being honest about. I feel sorry for everyone that has eaten here and we\u2019re unknowingly charged $3-4 more than what was posted on the window menu.. We as customers should feel confident in our local businesses treating us fairly. Taking advantage of your customers is no way to run a business!!! I implore the owner and operators of this establishment to read Florida Statutes XXXIII Chapter 501 on Consumer Protection and get their process correct. Never coming back.",

The delivery fee was reasonable at $2.50 compared to some of the delivery companies in the area. And the food arrived in 30 minutes when it was predicted in 45 so that was nice. However my salad was supposed to have both romaine and arugula but it only had romaine. Also, $7 seems a little steep for a small salad with no meat added on. The chicken tenders were okay, but very small also. I would have called them chicken nuggets not chicken tenders. Overall, I would eat there again, and hope to try their gluten free pizza next time, but 3 stars because everything was so small, and our order was missing an ingredient.",

Space is limited and I walked in with a stroller so there wasn't much space to park the stroller. We sat for a while (> 5 mins) and no one asked for our drinks or even brought menus. I got our own menu. I also noticed when the next family that came in with a small child sat behind us that they brought their menus and a children's menu with crayons. My daughter wasn't offered that at all even after the server came to take our drink orders. In their defense I did notice the health inspector for the City of Tampa was in there asking them a lot of questions for what seemed like a routine inspection. So I'm not sure if the staff was frazzled with him being there. But either way the service experience was subpar. The pizza was good enough to warrant coming back another time and testing it out.

The food came out quickly. The pizza is also available in gluten free or cauliflower crust if you don't want or can't have regular dough, but we got the dough and it was crazy good. Great sauce. Great crust. Great cheese. Great toppings. Everything tasted amazing! We don't normally get dessert, but it was so good here we went for it. One option is three chocolate chip cookies and you can get them alone or with a bowl of gelato (we got the gelato). It was also delicious and was perfect for my wife, my daughter and me to split.  Definitely try this place out if you get a chance.",

The manager at the time (this was a while ago) said if I \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough to eat out, then I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d How disrespectful. How I chose to spend the last few bucks in my account isn\u2019t his business, and isn\u2019t it a compliment that I would chose to spend it on this establishment? I didn\u2019t return for a while. Until I moved into the area. Recently on May 10, my friend and I wanted to enjoy some delicious pizza and wings. I realized we showed up with about 40 minutes left of the shop being open, but I didn\u2019t expect to be treated so rudely. The girl (with red or orange hair) said she is only taking to-go orders. And later was complaining to the other employee in front of my friend and I about \u201cwhy there were all these people coming in so late, don\u2019t they know they close at 11pm.\u201d We left outside to go eat, and when we went back inside to order drinks, the employee (with blonde hair) \u201cgreeted\u201d us by saying \u201cWhat?\u201d I was confused \u2014 did we do something to offend her? I said was \u201cexcuse me, did you just say \u2018what\u2019?\u201d And all she could say to play it off was \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I get it that you want to go home and you\u2019re tired, we\u2019ve all been there. But blatant rudeness is unacceptable. The employee looked so nervous as to what I might say or react, but by that time, my friend and I had had enough and tried to salvage our outing for the night by not escalating the situation. I love the pizza and the wings \u2014 this is one of my favorite spots in all of Tampa, but it keeps getting spoiled by poor employee-customer experiences.",

Today I feel the quality of the food really went down. And finally, I was shocked at how rude the service was. This is what definitely pushed me over the top and has made me decide that I would never be returning to this place anymore. Maybe because the staff felt overwhelmed when it starts to get busy. It showed significantly that the girls were not in a good mood and were annoyed at my requests after I received my food. The girls were cheeky and unessiarly mean.  I remember similar absuive service over the phone with previous orders. Such a shame. I really use to love this place.",

There is only street parking available, which to me is a downside (especially if you're not Dining in and are just picking something up). I didn't realize this before I went. After I circled the block a few times I called and Chelsea (I believe that was her name) answered. Should told me that there was only street parking, then said, \"Good luck.\" and hung up the phone. That rubbed me the wrong way, which is why my star rating is lower. The pizza was cheese sticks were fantastic, though!!",

The re was twice as much cheese as any pizza I have seen on a pizza before and all of the toppings were ground up so much it looked like we ordered a cat food pizza. Deciding to try it anyway the pie was undercooked and almost raw making the cheese into more of a soup. We decided the pie was inedible... after asking for the first time in history how a pizza could be so bad we were told the sauce is made in house. IF the sauce is not out of a can then whoever is cooking is not tasting what they make. Save yourself, do not eat the pizza here.",

The wings were a little disappointing which is why I gave them four stars. The sauce was greasy and dripping off, it didn't feel like it was baked in. The burger on the other hand was amazing. It was prepared perfectly and tasted great. They have plenty of TV's to catch a variety of action.",
