I feel that if you're going to send sandwiches or wraps in a sealed container with a pickle, there should be paper towels underneath the food to soak up the juice/steam. By the time the food got here, everything was very soggy and due to my condition I could only take a few bites with the soggy texture making me lose my appetite.  I would have definitely enjoyed the food if it kept its crispy texture. I ordered a rueben sandwich and philly cheese wrap.",

On the first day we thought it was a fluke when the table next to us got their food first, even though they had arrived and ordered long after us. But when it happened again the next day, I was about to cancel everything and walk out. When it finally arrived this time (in parts, my partner was almost finished with his, when mine came) it wasn't quite how we wanted it. My bread was burned, his poached eggs were rock-hard. The server gave the cooks a good talking to in the kitchen, which we could witness from our table. Afterwards he slammed stuff around and started piling up full plates on top of each other under the heater. Having worked as a chef myself I was shocked to see that.  It seems to me that they're taking on more than they can chew what with a full house, plus making take-out and app-ordered foods on top of that. The kitchen doesn't seem to be up to the challenge and honestly some of the servers run around like headless chicken too. It was okay the first day, but the second day was just stressful for us.",

Second time I didn\u2019t even sit. It was 2 in my party, another couple was waiting and another gentleman. There were 2 tables available with 4 person capacity each. The waitress with a semi-dyed curled hair said she cannot seat any of us in case if bigger parties come in and need the tables, but I see at the front corner near the window a couple sitting in a 4-person table.... I ask why must we wait if there\u2019s clearly no bigger parties around after 10 minutes of waiting, I was told it was policy and she can ask her manager but with such an attitude and sarcasm. In that minute they lost 5 paying customers. We couldn\u2019t ask if the couples can share a table? Or seat the people seprately? Oh and I called in attempt to fix this problem before posting, but the number listed does not work. If they want to stay afloat the ego needs to leave and management needs a retraining on how to properly take care of guests.",

The hash was pricey, and he got about three spoon fulls, if even that much (the tiny quantity was hidden underneath a piece of toast). My eggs benedict and breakfast potatoes were very cold, and the eggs were hard, very overcooked. Huge disappointment. It took another twenty minutes to get the attention of the girl at the counter because the waiter paid no attention. Luckily, I got a refund, but we still had to pay $11 for eggs, a piece of toast, and a few bites of cold hash.",

I give 2 stars because the manager/owner seemed very friendly and reasonably overwhelmed by the not so friendly staff. The food is pretty good for a 24/7 hour diner, I would give at least 4 if they got rid of the rude woman behind the counter who gave me a very unpleasant experience.

Since then, they\u2019ve changed their name about a dozen times, the inside looks different every time we come in. They jacked up the prices and if you want to customize your sandwich it costs more to add! They got rid of the friendly staff they had. Now they have a credit card minimum. The wait is so long it\u2019s ridiculous! Just not worth coming here anymore, it changed way too much.
