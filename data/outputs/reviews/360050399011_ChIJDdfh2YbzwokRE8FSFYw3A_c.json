Bought a 8pc shrimp dinner and a 2pc whiting fish dinner with mac and cheese. First the orders take 20-30 mins when frying fish or shrimp takes 2-3 in a fryer. With no customers in the building and no active delivery orders with them just talking and ignoring you and your order. (I guess people in Bronx don't deserve professionalism and customer service) further I asked for mac and cheese the manager/order taker (remember this it's important) I guess was leaving at 4pm to her babies as she stated but when she walked out the other girl cooking the fish said this was off referring to the steam table all day. She pulled out a new mac and cheese put it in the steam table went into the fridge grabbed cold milk poured into the mac and cheese stirred it and scooped it into my to go container with the 2 fish dinner. When I got in the car I opened the container only to be hit with a vinegar smell of old musty fish. I brought my food back and asked for my money only for that dinner back. Which their response was we don't give refunds. They said we need to call the manager and proceed to call the order taker that just left to her babies (\"the manager\") only for her to explain how and when she got the fish which she said that morning which before I got on the call the 1 cooking the food said they received the fish the day before. As a chef I know first hand by experience that you can receive old and musty fish from your vendor and if you are not inspecting your product this happens. I will never return and will not support a business regardless what ethic business owner they may be that doesn't respect the Bronx community with the professionalism and proper customer service. Or at least a system in place so your business can self sustain itself when no manager or owner in the building and the business is left to teenagers to manager and control the quality of food and type of service they provide. So much potential in the right location just poor decision making by the owner herself!!!",

Unfortunately, this visit was not as enjoyable I did an all whiting, all shrimp, collards and Mac n cheese since it just came out the oven......I'm a gal if southern decent. So I know a good fish fry and can whip up a cheesey Mac with a side of righteous greens in my sleep.  Having only done the fish only in the pass, this batch of whiting had the taste of just starting to go bad and in the state of consistency the seasoning was bland. The shrimp however was seasoned well but not crispy enough.  As for the sides, well the greens were under seasoned and the Mac required more cheese and some cream.  Oh well to the levels of inconsistency I suppose my fish fry well be relegated to home cooking or Saturdays in Harlem or to Fordham Fish without southern comfort food sides.",

        "caption": "I really wanted to like this restaurant so much. It's one of the very few soul food eateries in the Bronx and it's owned by a Black Woman. For those reasons alone it made me want to support this restaurant. After talking with a friend of mine who had previously tasted the food telling me the food was pretty decent, I figured I'd give it a try since I was in the area. The afternoon of Thursday June 27th was my first time ever visiting this establishment. Since it was ferociously hot outside, I was elated to see that the restaurant had adequate seating for us to come in from out of the heat and sit down to enjoy a meal. However, as we walked in and stood on line we realized that there was no AC, only a small floor standing fan that didn't really help to cut down on the heat coming in from outside. Still wanting to support the business and experience the restaurant we decided to stay and brave the heat. As we got to the front of the line to order, I inquired with the nice cashier as to how we could place our order since there were no paper menus available to look over and there were none posted anywhere around the restaurant. The only thing that was visible was a paper on the counter with 2 options that stated the special of the day. [The 2 large overhead TV's that hang over the counter were off, is where I'm assuming the menus would be displayed] The cashier politely told us that she could tell us what they have so we could place our order. After the cashier read us the food options off the POS screen in front of her, we placed our order, paid, sat down, and waited for our food. I ordered the 4 piece chicken wing meal with french fries, a side of mac & cheese, candied yams and a fruit punch drink. My friend ordered the same chicken dinner & drink, along with a fried catfish dinner, and a soda. The wait was a bit long but not a big deal to me because it was understandable seeing as how there were only 3 employees working: 1 was the cashier, and the other 2 were prepping and preparing the food. As we waited a little longer for our food, the friend I was with decided that she could no longer bear the heat so she wanted to take our order to go. That was fine seeing as how the next location we were going to would be sufficient to sit and enjoy our food. The cashier finally called our number and I went up to  the counter to retrieve our orders. She repeated the orders to me to verify they were correct (which I loved, because not many of the restaurants in the area take the time to confirm your order) we thanked her and left. After getting to our next destination and settling down, we were excited to taste our meals. As I opened the plastic containers, everything smelled delicious. The first thing I wanted to taste was the mac & cheese which was decent, but nothing special. Then I picked up one of my chicken wings and noticed a long black hair cooked into it. I was nauseated behind this and immediately turned off, I didn't even get to taste the rest of my food. My friend checked her food and said it looked to be fine, however at this point my appetite was ruined. I immediately packed my food back up and went right back to the restaurant for a full refund. After telling the cashier about this unfortunate situation and showing her the chicken, she did offer for my chicken to be redone but I kindly refused and she gave me a full refund with no problem. With all due respect, the girl that cooked the food was wearing a hair net and I totally understand that these situations are inevitable in any business and nothing is perfect so I'm not totally counting this establishment out. My friend said she enjoyed everything she had ordered, so I'll possibly give it another try. I wish this restaurant the best of luck and hope that it thrives for years to come. Hopefully when I return I'll have a better experience.",

They didn\u2019t have any menus available. Only one person working. A wait time of 20 minutes is just ridiculous. Even the person who I\u2019m assuming is the owner was so unpleasant.

It was definitely a disappoint and the collard greens were missing EVERYTHING, like they were picked this morning, boiled for 5 min and served. Also I\u2019m pretty sure that the corn bread was tiny corn muffins from Costco or BJ\u2019s. I am an avid soul-food seeker but this was terrible for soul-food. Please don\u2019t have any expectations for good service or real soul-food. And you will be ok. I would go as far as to say Boston market has more soul then this place.

If the pricing & menu options online does not reflect the ones in store then change them. Honestly that guy was so ignorant I contemplated walking out on the entire order. Macaroni and cheese was made with cheap cheese. The chicken wings had a good batter but were extremely under seasoned. Potato salad tasted days old and lacked flavor. And the shrimp was cooked in old grease which was still dripping off them in my plastic tray. Went to pick up my food & the Hispanic girl was just as ignorant as the other worker she forgot to charge me for the food & I didn't even get a thank you for my honesty or patronage.

Mac and cheese was overcooked, but we decided to give it a second try and glad we did. Had the whiting fish dinners with mac n cheese and collard greens and order of all wings. Everything was very good. Mac and cheese nice and cheesy and soft. Those little corn bread mini muffins are quite annoying but it is what it is, but they taste good. I'm that nice full square of cornbread type of girl, lol. Hopefully they are able to get to the point where they can make the peach cobbler the night before so when people want some for lunch on Fridays it is available. Otherwise I will definitely will return and try some different options.",

I traveled from Harlem (HOME OF THE REAL SOUL FOOD )The customer service was beyond horrible this place will lose customers due to rough staff and overpriced food this is not a soul food restaurant. soulful restaurant you can  taste the soul and the food all I taste that's been preprocessed. The macaroni and cheese is probably the  Worst thing, was extremely extremely salty. The Fish tasted very OLD  and tasted very bad. Honestly the best thing that I've had is the cornbread sad to say. The worst part about my visit to this soulful restaurant was probably noticing how rude the staff and the owner herself Millie was the food is not consistent in most of time it's horrible and it's usually not a lot of people in there considering the fact that it just . I HAVE YET TO SEE A GRADE. People you can get seafood for half the price here at Fordham fish Chicken and seafood for $5.50 on 188 and the grand concourse WAY BETTER !!!!!!!  I definitely wouldn't recommend  this restaurant  at all had a very bad first experience",

It\u2019s sits on a pool of oil and you can see the eggs scrambled in it because it\u2019s not being mixed well. The portions are small or at least it depends on who the customer is and they never have enough of anything. The main issue as I said at the beginning, is the poor customer service. It\u2019s incredible how unprofessional they. Usually it\u2019s inappropriate conversations with loads of curse words right in front of the customers and not caring if kids are present listening to their nonsense. If there are any good reviews it\u2019s because those must be friends or family of theirs but not actual customers that come off the street. They barely even have customers anymore and that\u2019s why they used channel 12 news to promote their unprofessional, rude, and disgusting behaviors and bad food. Now they are making a new place right next door which used to be a Kennedy\u2019s fried chicken so they can hire yet more staff that are not trained properly in social and professional skills. It\u2019s a shame that they are part of our community.",

Collards was a bit overcooked tasted like vinegar. Candied yams a bit sweet.   I order 2 slices of white bread & 2 slice of wheat bread on the price list it said 2 slices .50. Cashier said 2 slices is $1.  Last minute she said we do not have any white bread.  Spent $50 how you give only 2 forks 2 hot sauces no napkins.  I was trying to give this place some business by getting food for me and my Co workers.  But it's not worth it.  Workers  here need to know that you can't  be answering the phone with gloves on and than cooking.    Fish & Mac was the only thing that was not to bad.    I hate to say it but you can't put everyone to work in your establishment.  You need more upbeat friendly employees.  Who knows what they are doing on the register and in the kitchen.    They will have this establishment lose more customers.  Gained seven tonite and lost them all tonite too.  Also when you don't have something available after someone pays you must give a refund.",

The Mac and cheese was dry and only had cheese layered but the center was bland and no cheese. The potato salad was frozen. YES frozen. Who would serve frozen potato salad is this how you preserve it longer in the refrigerator? Frozen and tasteless hard potatoes and chunks of egg. They even got the nerve to advertise the fish as a fish sandwich but you get a corn muffin no bread. The muffin and the can soda was the best part.

The young lady in the front was not professional,  in fact she was rude and I had to let her know,  I'm grown little girl. I asked an older woman not to allow her to fix my food and I was disgusted by her attitude.  She was so engrossed in telling her story about the night before to the young man preparing the food.  I was sitting by the window and could hear the whole conversation clearly.  I honestly tuned her out as I was annoyed by her voice at this point. The food on the other hand, was good.  I am not certain if I'd return due to this experience.  However,  I will also reach out to the owner as she was not present.  The older woman & young man were much more professional and kind. Don't hire your friends, family,  local neighborhood kids if they aren't willing to help build your brand.  So the rating is due to your rude little cashier.
