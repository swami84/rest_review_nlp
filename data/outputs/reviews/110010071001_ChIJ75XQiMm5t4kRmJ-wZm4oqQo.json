I realized it was actually the only item on the list of specialties worth the 6.99 I paid. The place likes cash over credit...and if you give them CC, they have to conveniently walk to the back into the mangers office to run the card. Unfortunately , this area of DC lacks any real good places to eat. Bon appetit!!!",
