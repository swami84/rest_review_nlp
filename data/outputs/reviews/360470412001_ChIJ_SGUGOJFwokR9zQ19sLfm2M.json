        "caption": "Feel bad giving them low stars since they just opened but I was disappointed . The staff was very nice but the food was not great. Burrito barely had any meat, we literally had to look for the meat to see if they put any, couldn\u2019t taste it at all. Tacos were dry and came without any kind of sauce on the side. The soup for $8 was just broth with big pieces of mostly carrots and celery, ~5 pieces of potatoes and a whole chicken drum and thigh (don\u2019t get me wrong, I love chicken and it\u2019s a chicken soup after all, but I don't want to be taking out plain boiled chicken out of my soup to be able to eat it instead of just having it in pieces already where I can just enjoy it without worrying about breaking it up myself) . Some of the carrot pieces weren\u2019t even peeled. I might give them another try in a month or two when they\u2019re more established but for now I\u2019ll be getting my tacos at the food truck on McDonald Avenue.",
