My partner and I had their Lebanese celebration, kale and beet salad, za'atar fries, potato and leek soup and pan con tomate and it was a truly satisfying meal.

If you wouldn\u2019t mind telling me how you prepared the Lamb Kofta or Bulgir labneh, I would like to try making some for him at home, since he enjoyed it so much. He even asked if we could stay until his birthday in July. He said that he wanted to have his birthday at Cafe Fili ! What a thoughtful gesture to have the cake for my niece on her birthday! It was delicious, and my son and my mom enjoyed their desserts as well. I know my niece will remember her 10th birthday for years to come.
