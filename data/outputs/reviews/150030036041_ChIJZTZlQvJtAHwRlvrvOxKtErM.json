        "caption": "First time coming here and I was not impressed with their customer service. I dont know if this was a bad day for them, or if this is a constant experience. My friend made a reservation online for 8:30pm earlier in the day, and their website says they will call to confirm. My friend took the initiative to call the restaurant to make sure the reservation was made as it was for a friend's birthday, only for them to tell us that if they did not call to confirm our reservation, then it is invalid. It made absolutely no sense to allow online reservation if the restaurant won't keep the reservation.  We got to the restaurant and put our names down for a party of five around 8:15pm, and we were not seated until 10:10pm. The host didn't bother to give us an estimated wait time. She would walk a few feet outside, speak softly a name, then walk back in. We had to keep checking to see if she called our party, as people were leaving in frustration of the long wait time. Their excuse for the nearly two hour wait for us was that the large party was about to leave and they didnt have a table large enough for us. While we waited for a larger table, other parties after us were seated.  By the time we got a table, the table was not ready for us. We sat down as the waiter we had was quickly filling the table with sauces and utensils, but looked rushed and annoyed having to serve us. We wanted to order soju, but by the time we got seated, they stopped serving alcohol. Covid rules. Understandable, but very annoyed with the fact that we came early to try the soju and waited beyond the alcohol curfew to be served. We waited so long to eat, we decided to wait until the happy hour (10:30pm) to order. The waiter was extremely rude to us, and would walk away from us before we could finish talking. The table we sat at only had one burner open, and when we when we asked if we could use the second burner on our table, as our party was struggling to cook on one, the waiter told us the second burner was broken. So you not only made us wait for a larger table for two hours, but seat us at a table with one working burner? Ok. Sure. This guy was quick, but he didn't bother to explain to us how the ordering works, or explain what the sauces go with what food or tricks to using the grill. His rudeness and lack of communication skills made this first impression of service terrible.  About 3/4 into our time inside, a new younger waiter assisted us for the rest of the night. He was very nice, attentive, and was more helpful. He also checked on us regularly, unlike the first waiter. The first waiter came back to collect the bill, and could figure out how to split the bill with two cards. The second waiter had to come back to confirm splitting the bill and then proceeding to assist us for the rest of the time. The second waiter deserves the tips.  The food was okay for the price. They charge $10 extra if you have leftovers per person. The general experience was terrible up until the part the younger waiter served us for the remainder of the night. I don't think 2 hours was worth the wait for terrible customer service. It would be more appreciated if they speak up when calling for parties and have waiters with better interpersonal skills to serve customers. If you want to go here, be prepared to be disappointed.",

I do n\u2019t say much about the consumption amount. I can only say that the price is sorry for the food provided, but the things are really not delicious or even difficult to eat. Asked the shop assistants, they ordered all the meat. It \u2019s still unbelievable. I believe that the quality of this ingredient and taste will definitely fall in Asia. The only good place is the enthusiastic and active staff. Although I think it should be for tips. For the same amount of consumption, it is better to eat Popeye's fried chicken.

There is a melted cheese and egg around the net, and you can cook a thin egg while baking the meat. It might be good to put it on meat and bake it! . . First of all, it is a classic course to choose meat, seafood, and speciality sundobuchige. . . . However, prices are all expensive in Hawaii.

They split us up to tables somewhat close to each other which was fine.  Our table of 2 adults and 2 children ordered shrimp, scallops and sliced rib eye.  They brought us about 4-5 large shrimp, around 7 scallops and maybe 7-8 slices of thinly sliced meat.  Took probably around 30-40 minutes after ordering to receive and at least 10 minutes to cook the shrimp.  They are not even cooking the mains, why did it take so long? Later orders of mains were received a bit faster but not any larger (we ordered our 3rd and final mains immediately upon receiving our 2nd).  Also told us they ran out of the sides we ordered 30-40 minutes after we had ordered them with the first order (we had to ask if our sides were coming).  Ordered different lower value sides which came 20 minutes after that.  At least an hour for sides.  Wound up leaving generally unsatisfied over 2 hours later. 2 hours because of bad service, not overeating.",

Bring a few lettuces that you didn't let them and they're all going to get paid for nothing else;; Would you like to hear Woah ~ Thank you so much or want a tip; And I'm at a loss trying to control the fire, so I'll have some staff turn around and I'm not sure it's ripe on the blood on the plate. I think I've eaten some food. I just wanted to say unlimited refilling up to three times. I think it's been the fourth time. The sixth is the last one brought by the kitchen man? I'm asking you. It comes with unlimited refills of 2 people, 2 bottles of shochu, and a tip of 100,000 won. It includes a stone-cooked bibimbap stew. The taste is soso and the ceiling is high and good. Compared to the ceiling height, the air conditioner was not enough because it was not enough. There is no return doctor.

All you can eat for $26.50 per adult. Everything we tried was delicious! Marinated chicken, brisket bulgogi, pork belly, marinated kalbi (beef), fried noodles, and more. Surrounding the little table grill was mac and cheese, corn with cheese, and eggs which were great added to the fried noodles. The service was spot on. Our server, Shawndi (sp?), was extremely personable. He helped us cook some of the meats, suggested his favorite menu items to try (the kalbi which was by far the tastiest), and told us about other great places to eat. Everyone there was super attentive. I can't say enough good things. We'll definitely be going back. This place is a must-go-to in Honolulu.",

The only thing I disliked about the all you can eat option here was how we can only order 3 items at a time. It slowed us down as we were a big group. I loved the side dishes on the hot platter like the corn cheese, macaroni and cheese and the eggs! I would recommend the the kalbi, it was so tender and delicious!

According to all the info they close at 2am. Got an Uber {$15) and arrived in at 12:50, a full hour and 10 minutes before closing. We walk in and are immediately told last call already passed, she was clearly not happy to see us. We let them know that we just took an Uber and their listing says they close at 2am. She then leaves for 5 minutes and another gentleman comes up to us and says that last call is in 5 minutes so we will only be able to order one or two pieces, but still pay full price.. So ultimately we had to call another Uber, this one costing $20.. All in all this place cost us $35 and turned us away even though they were open for another hour.. If it was packed I would understand, but it wasn't. I'm in Oahu probably 15 times a year, but this spot has been removed from restaurants to try.",

I have to admit that the food was delicious and almost all of the workers were very friendly and gave us lots of refills of side dishes. Although the reason to why I rated this restaurant 2 stars was because of one waitress that had very poor attitude.  I have been to many Korean bbq grills before and we were all familiar with the style of cooking. The waitress started explaining to us how their menu had changed and told us what to do. We got a little confused so we asked for help when deciding what to order and the waitress came with the most disturbing attitude and started pointing things out that we were doing wrong but it was almost as if she was giving us a lecture. After that she came a few more times but she continued with the disrespectful attitude and even ignored us a few times.  As a customers point of view, I believe that the style of this waitress was very disrespectful. We, customers came to enjoy our food in a positive mood, we did not come to hear a lecture and get ignored by a waitress. Moreover the waitress is getting paid to serve the customers food in a positive mood. The waitress should not be passing the negativity to the customers. Just to make sure, this was one waitress. All other waiters/waitresses were very friendly but the one waitress made us want to get up and leave but we decided to just stay and enjoy the food.  Please, as a customer\u2019s perspective, these actions such as lecturing us, nagging us, and ignoring us are unacceptable. I am very disappointed by the imperious behaviour and I will not be visiting again, although I do hope that the environment changes in this restaurant.",

The bathroom was rather nasty clearly they're not spending any money there. The bulgogi and B-bop was flavorful...however all the other meats lacked seasoning and was bland. Looks like they were understaffed when I went and service was a okay given the lack of staff members. Expect to shower after you leave. We both woke up the next morning with sore throats from all the excessive smoke inside. FYI you will need to launder your clothes after you leave . Recommendation to the owners get better AC and proper ventilation through your restaurant and staff the restaurant properly. I have eaten at many other open top grills and I've never walked out so coated in smoke and sweaty. Not a bad place but could be lots better.",

When we got there we were seated in less than 15 minute which is great for a party of 7.  Everything was great until or server came by to start her service.  The server proceeded to explain how the restaurant ran; in terms, of the forms you filled out and how many you can order each time.  All of which we understood but her tonation made us feel like idiots.  After this initial experience I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt until I was holding the tongs in my hand and she just pulled it right out of my hands without saying a word.  I am sorry but regardless of what eatery place you go to, customer service dictates that you use your customer service skills or just people skills and say, \"is it okay if I use the tongs that you are holding in your hands to flip the meat,\" etc.  The horrible customer service continued.  She came over and cooked the meat.  When she was gone, we began cooking our own meat like any other Korean grill place and not unlike the other customers sitting beside us we placed the meat of our choice of meat on the grill and waited for the meat to cook.  The server came by our table again and proceeded to tell us to not cook more than 1 meat on the grill.  Needless, to say she continued this nagging statement again and again despite us telling her that the other guests were doing the same.  The server continued to state that, \"she was a professional.\"  Through this statement alone was enough to make us want to get up and leave; however, I was determined to not let her ruin our experience.  Unfortunately, I had to discuss these concerns with the manager but our experience will never be excellent or as we had envisioned.",

If the menu has changed, you can only eat unlimited meat with all you can eat. The seasoning is plain, but the meat quality is very bad. The meat called premium steak is very soft and I don't want to try other beef. The marbled and pork belly are a little better. Because I don't change the fire often, I grill the meat on a black board, so the meat is used. I can make three sides, so I ordered tofu stew, lunch box, and fried chicken, but the tofu stew is outrageous. Chicken is 2 pieces of big chicken, but it doesn't taste good and I don't want to eat visuals. Memories lunch box is soso. The meat roaster was very friendly.
