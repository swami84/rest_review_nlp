Highly recommend trying multiple cocktails and deserts. This is not the place to skip either of these treats. Highly recommended for locals and visitors alike.

The appetizers were exquisite, we had a mushroom salad that brought the taste of the out-of-doors to the table and a squash salad with duck confit that I can still taste.  It had the wonderful creamy sweetness of the squash, but there was this smoky, ducky flavor throughout. If you like oysters, you must order their \"bar snack\"  of marinated oysters.  The oysters were plump and delicious and the brine did not toughen them, it seems to make their taste even better (if that's possible!). We had the duck breast as a main course and it was tender, flavorful and maybe the best duck I\"ve ever had; plus the pork with sunchokes which was excellent. The waiter chose wines to accompany our dishes and he did a great job. My only suggestion to you is not to over-order.  We ordered the bread and the cashews and the charcuterie board, all of which were great, but contributed to that sense you've eaten too much.  So be judicious in ordering so you can savor every bite.  The waiter suggested maybe 3-4 appetizers and 2 mains.  I think one of each would have been better, and left more room for dessert! A must-visit restaurant and our thanks to the many many staff that worked to get everything so right!",

But now the important part, the food. I am a very picky person when it comes to flavor.  But absolutely eveyeverything I had, I enjoyed (besides a cheese ice cream, it was kind of weird). I did have the Verizon up meal, so eveythever was kind of prefixed, but still very impressed.

We were very excited to try Hugo's... and left, two hours later, very disappointed. The portions were very very small for the price (and no, we were not expecting an all-you-can-eat buffet). There is some complimentary stuff they bring through your dinner (a little fried fish, biscuits and chocolates at the end) and they tasted better than what we ordered... though it would have been nice to have 4 biscuits for a table of 4 people, but, hey, at this point, nothing could have salvaged this dinner. The service was not that good and when one of us told the waiter that his plate did not contain any clams (he told us that the Fruit de mer plate contained clams) the waiter was a little arrogant and said: \u00abOf course, that is a clam, sir\u00bb... pointing to a dime-sized piece of clam under a large parsley leaf. We didn't even try desserts, because, honestly, why stay there a minute more? I think people who gave 5 stars to this restaurant are either friends of the staff, got a free dinner or enjoyed a whole other menu that we have not seen tonight. This is my first and only review on Google about a restaurant... I don't usually take the time to write them but if someone reads this and decides to go elsewhere, it will have been worth it.",

The food was very expensive and seemed like the chef was more cornered with trying something different and the \"look\" of the dish instead of the taste. Each dish had extremely unbalanced and clashing flavors. On top of that the service left a lot to be desired and when I called attention to my dissatisfaction with the food the staff couldn't have cared less. Never have I experienced such indifference to a dinner's enjoyment and concerns.  Luckily after a few courses we had the good sense to cut our losses and ask for the check and not continue the five course tasting menu.  We received very much the same attitude and responses from the manager on staff who had no desire to salvage the experience. It's unfortunate that in a town with such great food, that this restaurant leaves dinners with a bad impression of Portland food and hospitality. Skip this place and go to Fore St or one of the other great restaurants where they don't take their rating or customers for granted.",

Let's start with the obvious, this isn't a \"value\" play. The menu is fixed price and changes daily. The staff does a great job with service, and pacing between the courses is great. They seemed to break up longer dishes with smaller plates. The portions were appropriate and I left feeling full.  The actual dishes were impressively complex. Each dish seemed better than the next. Would highly recommend.",
