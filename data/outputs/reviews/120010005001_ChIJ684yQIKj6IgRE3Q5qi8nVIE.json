I love fried shrimp, and I was born and raised here on the outer Banks and I've eaten shrimp from all over...these were the best !!! Nice atmosphere, area is open so it seems just a bit noisy but not terrible. For that quality of food a little noise is acceptable. Staff was friendly, great place, I'll be back !",

It used to be a quick decent bite to eat, with a little lacking in flavor but overall worth the price. Maybe it's losing money but at this point it's inconsistent as to whether you'll get any of the additions you ask for and mind you, if you don't pay  an extra $0.50 per vegetable, it's not about getting extra. Be prepared to receive rice, meat and a couple pieces of potato. Pay an extra 2 bucks to maybe add some salt or seasoning and flavor to an otherwise fairly bland base with diluted curry sauce, and you may or may not be lucky enough to receive it. Overall has been going down slowly but has finally become notably lacking in effort.",

I love fried shrimp, and I was born and raised here on the outer Banks and I've eaten shrimp from all over...these were the best !!! Nice atmosphere, area is open so it seems just a bit noisy but not terrible. For that quality of food a little noise is acceptable. Staff was friendly, great place, I'll be back !",

Steamers had the same idea, but just not quite as good flavor wise. They make up for, or rather mask, the lack of authentic seasoning with heat. So if you enjoy spice, get it as hot as you can handle and you'll probably still enjoy it.  There's a huge amount though so you can reheat and reseason the leftovers the next day.  Personally enjoy the peanut sauce addition, gives a little bit of flavor but the veggies and meat need something. The steamer sandwich is not recommended, but only tried it once.  It's presumably their special, but stick to the fried rice and curry dishes if in the area. If willing to spend a little more money, go to if it is down the street for delicious authentic Thai.",

Unfortunately, I was unable to experience any of this; however, it might not be a bad thing after all. I read an article that Ken Eats Gainesville wrote about this place called Steamers reopening in Bo Didley Plaza and I knew it was fate... Actually that's not true. When I first heard the name, I instantly thought about this awful place back in my hometown and thought they were the same restaurant.  Food & Service: Getting a little off topic, anyways, I went with a friend just last week to go and check the place out myself. I was thrown off when their menu consisted of fried rice and curry with woks lined up in plain view. Apparently the name comes from steaming their burgers but the fried rice and curry seem to be more popular. Steamers is also considered vegetarian on Yelp, just a tad confusing in my opinion. Despite the confusion, I appreciated their water dispenser and outside seating. This is definitely the kind of place you could bring your friends to hang out and eat on one of their benches. The food took a little longer than expected but the portions were huge! Unless you're starving, you'll probably need a box. Price was very reasonable, we paid about $8.00 or $9.00 each. My friend ordered the fried rice which was pretty flavorful and cooked well. I ordered the curry with tempeh. I was told their tempeh was pretty awesome and I wouldn't disagree. Note that this was my first time having tempeh though lol.  Final Thoughts: All in all, good place to stop by and eat! I'll be back and probably with a group of friends this time since the outdoor seating gives a nice catch up, get together feeling. I also want to give their steamer burger a try.",

Definitely not worth the price ($9.99+tax) nor the wait time.
