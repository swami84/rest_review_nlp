I wouldn't say the dishes were unique or exotic...they were typical sushi dishes, but the quality and freshness is what shined through. An extra bonus was the coffee jelly dessert. That dessert was the proverbial cherry on top of a great meal. The night we came, the parents of Chef's son-in-law were dining next to us so it was nice to chat with them and learn a little about Chef and his family. I was told that Chef had prepared a meal for the Emperor of Japan in the past so that was very cool to find out.",

I recommend making reservations since they don't take walk ins unless seating is available. The three of us had the Omakase special without the sashimi. Wife and I had a couple of beers and I also had a glass of sake. All the Nigiri sushi was good except that I prefer to have my sushi on the cooler side. Not sure if the rice was warm or the seafood itself. At the time of our visit there was only one sushi chef and I'm not sure if there are more if it's more crowded. Our reservations were for 6pm. There were two other people in there and people walked in without reservations and were turned away. Service was good since there weren't many of us at the time. We enjoyed our sushi, but the price will probably prevent us from going back. We've been to many sushi bars and this one was quite pricey for the amount of food and drinks that we had.",

When my friend and I came, we were the only ones there for a good 30 minutes because all other seats are reserved. That's another thing, make reservations! They hardly do walk-ins.  Second, the owners are so nice and adorable!! At first the Sushi chef was mean mugging, but after some gentle nudging he opened up. They are elderly but they know their sushi! The sushi chef's wife takes all orders and brings it out to you.  My favorite sushi was the aji and kohada. They make this delicious ume sauce that they glaze the fish with and it's so good! Hands down my favorite place for these specific nigiris.  I definitely need to make the time to come back! It's a different and much more intimate experience with the sushi chef and his wife versus larger restaurants.",
