Im convinced they do not know how to fry battered food...two times in row is not acceptable.  Previous post September 3.2020 My pickup of chicken basil rice, red curry chicken and cucumber salad went well and was delicious but the vegetable tempura tasted and felt as if they were refried,  not edible and extremely hard..almost like eating an very old and hard tollhouse chocolate chip cookie mixed with concrete. My poor presentation of tempura which is normally, light and crunchy, this was the complete opposite. It should have been very obvious when it was given to me that it was over cooked or recooked.

When I received my food packaged to go I thought it was kind of odd (and wasteful) but sat down to eat it. Apparently it was a mistake to dine in because the owner got into a huff. Mind you a few minutes ago she was smiling at me as I interacted with her small daughter as I ordered. Long story short: the owner had a nasty attitude because I dared to dine in and eat my food. There were two other customers dining in so I didn't see the big deal. If you don't want people to dine in either tell them and/or consider if you really need to own and operate a sit down restaurant. The food was mediocre on top of the nasty attitude. Needless to say I won't be back.",

It seemed as if it had been sitting in the styrofoam container all day and then nuked when ordered  and a few shredded carrots thrown in a corner. When I got it and put my fork in, the whole thing came up at once in a big gelatinous mass, all stuck together. It had a brown sauce all over it and looked and tasted awful. It went in the garbage.

The egg rolls were good and they provided enough sweet n sour sauce in a cup for both of them \ud83e\udd5a. The Thai iced tea was really sweet\ud83c\udf6f, but I appreciate that I said not a lot of ice and they didn\u2019t put a lot in \ud83e\udd5b. Nothing is worse than walking home with melting ice in your Thai iced tea and having to drink it watered down lol. Finally I saw they had mango sticky rice and so I ordered it expecting them to say it was out of season but they had it. The rice was good and maybe they should charge extra when it is out of season for them to keep mangos in paper bags to make them ripe rather than sell them unripened. I\u2019ll keep it in the fridge a few days and cross my fingers lol. So far Snail Queen Thai is the only other Thai place with them on the menu, but their mangos are PERFECT. All in all this was really good and I\u2019m likely to make this my go-to local Thai restaurant. I love I can walk to them but plus side they deliver so it\u2019s great \ud83d\udc95",

I was reeeally hungry,  but decided to wait until they arrived to order (not knowing they'd be late until after i got there). I think the waiter that day thought i didn't actually have any friends coming after waiting for so long for them to arrive. He kept seating other people and side-eyeing me as the moments passed.  Once my friends did actually arrive,  he immediately came to table and took our orders and looked at me like 'oh, okay,  you were waiting for actual people,' lol.  The place itself is nice,  full of Thai ambiance and the prices are really affordable.  I'd recommend it.",

When I asked if I seat myself  the one server working said, \"How many!\" and \"Sit there!\" This set the tone for my opinion of the place. I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai, after waiting about 35 mins. I started to think they forgot about my order and started to look around (I was on the parking meter). The dish arrived about 5 mins later. It was just okay, unremarkable. The 6 shrimp were overcooked and the noodles a bit dry. I didn't mind the sweetness. I washed it down with a canned ginger-ale. The bathroom was dark, cold and in need of maintenence. The price was fair  but I probably won't go back as I didn't feel welcomed there.",

At first I thought someone accidentally poured a bottle of soy sauce on it (which might have been an improvement) but discovered the black liquid was a basically flavorless water. 3. Curry Duck had slightly more duck but still less than 2 ounces. Sauce was less bland than the black sauce, but still unrecognizable as a curry. 4. For what you received it was WAY overpriced. 5.  I was dinning with a companion, the dishes were served separately - which was surprising since both were cold. 6. Only one worker in the dining room, who was pleasant, but often missing. Which leads us to believe that he was the only worker in the restaurant, and was serving food from a steam table that was not on.  7. Conclusion: I know that all restaurants have bad days, and if my only experience there was typical.. this restaurant would be closed.",

The crab rangoon was mostly just fried dough because there was hardly any trace of the imitation crab meat that's supposed to be in it.

She scoffed, rolled her eyes, and sighed as she walked away. Two minutes later she comes by and tosses it on the table.As a server myself, I get that we all have bad days. But her sour attitude was such a turn off to me. I even over heard her less than nice interaction with the other table in the place. The food itself is a bit bland as well. I assume things have changed a lot since all the nice reviews because I can't understand why people would like this place. Never again for me. Totally ruined my lunch.",

While enjoying my day walking through Hyde Park after a business meeting and some shopping, I saw Thai 55 and decided to give it another try.  My first experience there wasn't so great.  The satay chicken was super oily without any taste and the bathroom smelled like an outhouse.  But hey, maybe they had a bad day....nope!  This visit was so disappointing and insulting I had to leave immediately!  I go in and wait about 10 minutes before anyone says anything to me...and there were only 2 other people in the restaurant at 5pm.  About 2 people less than the last time I was there, so that should have told me something.  The female waiter came over while I was looking in my purse for my wallet and then walked away without taking my order.  5 minutes later after waiving another waiter down, a man comes over.  I asked him if he had ginger tea, which is not normally advertised on menues but most Thai food places have it by request.  He said no and so I end up choosing the Jasmine tea.  He stood there with a sarcastic look on his face and asked me \"is that it\".. I said yes, for now.  I swear to you, his face turned red.  He told me that I couldn't just order tea. I have to order something else.  YEP!  I said I just want tea for now, is that alright.  He said \"no, people think they can just order tea and just sit in the restaurant for long time this is busy time for us\"....  I took another look around the restaurant to find that there was now only one other person in the restaurant than me and asked him to look around too.  I couldn't believe what I was  hearing.  I told him...hey, I will order...but I just want tea to start....this vegetable brain just stood there like an idiot.  I said ya know what....don't bring me anything.  I won't be disrespected by anyone, certainly not you.  How dare you treat me like this.  Then as I was grabbing my coat and purse he continues to explain the crazy policy of no one item like beverage only during rush hour.  What a waste of brain space.  I will never go there again or recommend that place.  From the other review I have read here, I should have taken heed.",

When they realized that, the main dish was already under way and eventually was sitting there - and got cold. When we pointed that out, they said: \"That is okay, in the kitchen it is even colder....\" At the end, the bill was wrong and miscalculated - partially because the cashier maschine did not print any more properly, partially, because they just made an over the thumb calcualtion. So we did our own math. When we pointed out that the bill was 11% too high, they negated it first, then calculated again and found out, that it - ooops - was too high indeed. Then a totally lukewarm apology. The attempt to use the toilett was immediately interrupted when the door was opened.... Just a nightmare (February 28th 2015). Simply unbelievable. It was the first time in 10 years I left no tipp. There are better places in Hyde Park.",
