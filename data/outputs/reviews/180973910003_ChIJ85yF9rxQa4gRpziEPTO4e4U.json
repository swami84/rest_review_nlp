I was greeted and I ordered a drink and the bartend disappeared for what seemed like 10 minutes, when see returned to the bar area she not acknowledge me for another ten minutes, five of which, I was hoping to order another drink and an appetizer. I thought then, I should close my tab and find another place to eat. I decided to be patient and see if things would get better...they did not. The other two patrons at the bar left, so it was only me. The service did not improve. I was committed to making every effort to be fair...silly me.  Being the only one seated at the bar,  I felt like i was on a deserted island. The restaurant was not busy but the service was absolutely terrible. I order my meal,  king crab legs and they did not taste fresh at all and were over cooked. Long story short, after dropping over $200 for a meal for my self the experience was extremely disappointing. I would not recommend visiting this restaurant under it's current management. So many other places to eat that can offer better dining experience at a lower price point.  Disappointed diner",

And the caviar for a mere $150 took like 25 minutes to get. Unacceptable.  While the manager came over and apologize he did nothing to rectify the situation. Unfortunately the manager is ill seasoned to provide exceptional service at this location. He's argumentative and seems to have the position that the customers might be trying to get something for free. I guess spending almost $500 for dinner and wine with a whopping party of one is isn't an indication to him that I might know what fine dining is and I might have the money for it and I expect to be treated with decency.   This guy needs to retrained or he needs to be retrained. I've dined at multiple locations across the United States and this gentleman is the worst manager I've ever encountered. To boot until I argued a bit after receiving the sour oyster this guy only took one of the six oysters off the check. I had to try to give him a little schooling on fine dining and customer service and ask him to take all six off the check. He finally did so.",

Jesse and Aaron did a fabulous job.  Jesse recommended the chicken fried lobster.  My wife could not have been more satisfied with this dish. It was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. The King crab was by far the best I've ever had. I wasn't sure how much to order. We decided on a pound and a half and it was more than enough. We finished the course with the chocolate carmel cheesecake. It included white and chocolate chips.  It was a massive slice and definitely amazing.  The valet staff is also exceptional.",

The staff made sure we were near each other and talked to us as a group. They even printed out special menus that said \"Happy Birthday from Oceanaire\" at the top! The menu is much smaller than usual, but plenty of delicious offerings were still available. I ended up ordering the crab cakes and garlic green beans on the side. It was all FANTASTIC!! To my surprise bout waiter brought out an Oceanaire Baked Alaska for me  my birthday. It was visually stimulating as well as tasty!! One of my top 10 restaurants in Indy!!",

It was the first that we had both been there and it was absolutely beautiful. It was wonderful. The menus were custom-made. The decor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant was elegant, refined, and alluded subtle class. Smooth jazz played in the background, which made our booth feel more cozy and intamite. The meal was prepared with care using only the most fresh as well as local ingredients. Lastly and certainly most important, the service was excellent. Our waiter was the most kind gentleman. He encouraged us to try new items and if we had any questions about food, then he was more than happy to inform us if we had any questions about how the food was cooked or where the ingredients were imported. Clearly, I have nothing but high praise and I will certainly looks forward to the next time that I dine at the Oceanaire.  P.S. I highly recommend the truffle mash potatoes. This had to be the most silky and smooth mash potatoes that I have ever had the good fortunate to taste. Each mouthful was literally a heavenly experience.",

They prepared her dinner at the table. It was overcooked. My fish was not much better. We politely expressed that we were not satisfied. They replied there isn\u2019t anything we can do but we are sorry.  $150 bill, we walked down the street and had to get something else to eat because we were both still hungry. Tried calling a manager a few times to let them know of our experience. They didn\u2019t care. We will never go again. We prefer Ocean Prime.",

I took a coworker and had to apologize several times for the service that we received, it was embarrassing to say the least. After the waitress told us the specials and asked us if we had any questions She acted very inconvenienced that we did indeed have questions. \u201cRitzy\u201d scallops were on the menu (I usually end up always ordering the scallops,  and they are usually incredible), but  when I asked her about them, her description literally was \u201cit\u2019s scallops with some Ritz crackers and butter\u201d ......(crickets, crickets, crickets).....ummmm no thank you and I\u2019m so sorry that I have inconvenienced you by asking you to  elaborate on your menu.  Our appetizers were brought out and then our food was brought out very shortly after that with our appetizer plates still sitting on our table, no place for our food to go. So we graciously piled up all of our plates for the food runner to make room for our new Plates. Some of the appetizer plates were  taken and some where left. silverware was not replaced when taken away and We had to keep stopping different waitstaff to refill our waters or simply order a cocktail.  My guest had asked the waitress to recommend a wine pairing with her dinner and after she reminded the waitress a second time the waitress again very snuggly recommended A house zen and came and filled her glass without allowing her to taste it. I could excuse the poor service if she was really busy  and tried to apologize for her short comings but she didn\u2019t seem to mind how our dining experience was going. the table behind us was getting good service from he.  Normally I tip between 30 and 35% and on a $230 bill that would\u2019ve been a pretty good tip but this time I only left 18% and I still thought that was way more generous than what she deserved.  The service was so terrible it made the food mediocre, and the experience was nothing short of what a low dollar steakhouse service would give. I come in for the environment the experience and the good food  and top-notch service. Tonight service Was very disappointing.",

I was scolded in the presence of my guests for asking why we all had to pay 17% per check for gratuity and a $5 fee per check for a large party. He rudely stated he did me a favor by not charging me $300 that we were short on the contract & we only spent $500 between 7 people. It was disrespectful so I emailed corporate and still no response from them three weeks later.  The food was delicious but the service was not. I will not be return.

The store is pretty pricey and the ambiance is perfect for a special occasion or business meeting if your expense account can handle it. BUT,  my wife took me there to celebrate my birthday. I know this was a difficult choice considering the cost. I actually did not eat my meal beyond a bite and got full on the bread. The waiter, although good and attentive, never asked me how my meal was (hence only 3 for him). So, no opportunity to ask what was up with the terrible fish. Anyway,  I did not want to make my wife feel bad by initiating a conversation about my Mexican Sea Bass. However, when she saw the leftovers in the fridge for the 3rd day she remarked  'the food wasn't very good this time.\" I said no it wasn't. It was horrible. We have enjoyed the food here before although we do not go often. I told her I didn't want to make a scene. She said I have her permission for this review. The fish was very dry to be Sea Bass from any waters (I actually think it was cod). The asparagus was mushy (which I can live with) but tasteless except for the attempt at blackening it. Plenty of charcoal taste. I still have it in the fridge because I can't bear to throw out considering I ordered and paid for a full portion (salt to my wound). It was expensive.  I came home and eat a bowl of vegetables because the bread wore off. I'm hoping we hit on a bad day although I am definitely reluctant at taking another $120+ stab at it. On that day we probably should have stuck with Bone Fish grill and their Sea Bass... :(",

A day before our reservation, a woman called from the restaurant to state that they will have a limited menu and that there was a $90 minimum. This was fine but we were frustrated because we had already picked out other options from the full menu. Once we sat down for dinner, we realized it was a $90 fixed menu PER PERSON! $90 minimum is a little different than $90 per person... the portions were extremely tiny. We paid $20 for ONE crab cake at the bar before dinner because we had no idea it was $90/person once we sat down for dinner. The food was good but we are very disappointed with the misinformation. We will not be back. There are several other seafood options in Indy that have better food with better pricing.",

Then on to the main course, The King crab legs, along side we ordered the creamed sweet corn, Sweet potato, lobster mac and cheese, and the bacon steak. The bacon steak was a little tough, and the sweet potoatos were nothing special, but everything else was excellent. The 4 star should be a 3. (( cleanliness our booth was very very dusty along the back of the booth seats and all the wine class's were cloud. For a fine dinning place and for the price, the class's should sparkle)) but I'm giving it a 4 because the food was excellent and service was as well.",

Nothing up stairs, and desserts only came out one time. When they were gone, they didn\u2019t replace them with anything but bad chocolate chip cookies. They didn\u2019t have the choices that they usually have. Didn\u2019t have the lobster Mac & cheese. They packed up the wine early too. The only thing good about the night was the band, Hit locker. They were fantastic. We paid a lot per ticket & had 12 people that we brought with us. Some came for the first time & it was a let down. Doubt they will come back next year. We love Oceanaire, my husband & I always choose it for our anniversary, birthdays or any other special occasion. Just very disappointing.",

        "caption": "We are fairly frequent diners here and  appreciate the well prepared seafood. This time we visited on a recent Monday, and both my husband and I agree this was the best meal yet.  We were immediately greeted, reservations confirmed and seated our preference. Staff quickly  provided water and menus. Heather our waitstaff was fabulous!  She was personable, knowledgeable about the restaurant, and enthusiastic yet very professional (if you think about it,  those are four  qualities that are very hard to meld into one person, but she rocked it!). We apreciated   Heather's knowledge with the menu, and  she expressed the highest confidence in what she felt were several of the best choices (we asked). We usually order all types of shellfish (always delicious!), but this time we stepped out of our comfort xone and settled on a couple of her recommendations and a couple of our favorites. We started with a cup of clam chowder and the baby octopus with Brussels sprouts for appetizers. The chowder was, - as usual  -  rich and buttery with plenty of clams. Heaven! We were completely blown away with how good the  baby octopus tasted  -  perfectly seared meat, and the Brussels sprouts were simply the best we had.- the flavors were executed the best way  - no hint of any  bitterness or sulfur often found with this vegetable.  For dinner we had the seared fresh Washington Troll King Salmon with lump blue crab, caper and beurre blanc,  and the Alaska Halibut cheeks with carmelized onion and blue cheese butter.  The salmon was perfectly prepared,  and had a very generous top of tender crabmeat along with the gentle seasoning and very light sauce .  My hubby can generally take or leave salmon, but this time he cleaned his plate with gusto!  The halibut cheeks were a symphony of complimentary flavors. The cheeks were 'almost' a touch too spicy by themselves.  But when each bite included the spicy cheek with a bit  of  carmelized onion and a touch of  blue butter  ..... wow, the taste was truly amazing! We asked about the chef of the night,  and Heather credited Executive chef Aaron and student chef Kellem. So,  Heather,  Aaron and Kellem,  along with the other very attentive and professional staff this evening,  thank you for the best anniversary dinner we've had!",
