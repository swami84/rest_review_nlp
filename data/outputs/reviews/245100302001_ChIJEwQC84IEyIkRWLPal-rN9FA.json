The staffs attitude went right along with their crappy prices. We were the only customers at the time and it seemed as if we were inconveniencing them. Will never go here again or if I do I will definitely bring my own ice.",

I had a quick question about a gift card and he proceeded to yell at me, said he was the manager and he could not connect me to anyone else and hang up on me on the phone. When I called back, he continued to be angry and hung up on me again. To be honest, I was flabbergasted at this attitude. I hope no one tries to eat there again",

I hate to complain so my husband mentioned it to the server when she came to take the baskets, When we questioned the server she said that the chef must not of put seasoning in it which seamed a bit strange why would you not season a burger? I'm not talking spices I'm talking a little salt and pepper, she informed me not all people like seasoning so we don't season it ??? yes I'd eaten half of it to make sure I wasn't over reacting. well instead of taking my honest feed back on this awefull burger the manager got all defensive on the matter. I'm not happy about it so there for should not be charged for it,  the manager agreed to discount the 14$ burger and while she was doing that she decided to make fun of the complaint to the other staff working, how very rude and unprofessional of her. Don't eat here. A manager with no cooking skills and poor customer service is a terrible combination for a business.",
