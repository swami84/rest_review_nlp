So, let me start out by saying I consider myself to be an Epicurean & Professor Of Gastronomy (Self Crowned), & a self-made Chef (Honorary, & again gave myself that title) But, In a fat Chicagoan & a foodie that not only has mad skills in the kitchen, but have worn every hat in the restaurant industry you can think of. Simply, I'm not snooty, easy to please, & good food is just good food.  Which brings me to 'MAK'.  Haven't had Chinese food in a while, and I love all the unique, Oriental flavors of Asiana, so a new place, representing such, I was excited.  I purchased my mandatory pork egg rolls, & one of their 'special' dishes with rice noodles & paid $4 to upgrade: add beef.  I call the order in, directing to give me the wide rice noodles, & fry them crispy.  I arrive for pick up, my order hasn't even been started. The guy goes over to a steam table, grabs 2 tiny sad looking soggy ore-made egg rolls, takes a plastic container, slaps 2 scoops of Pre-made slop and goes to put lid on, (oh, the beef!) then tings some little nibblets if Beef, throws on too gives it to me.  There's a line, so I let the crispy noodle request go, & figured I'd try first time as is.  And my assessment: 1) Called in pick-up, get there, not even started.(not busy) 2) egg rolls tiny, soggy, Pre-made warm and must be pork 'flavored' cause there wasn't no pig meat in there. 3) 2 scoops of soggy slip, %90 noodle & cabbage (that's being liberal, prob less) 4) Noodles not cooked crispy as requested 5) Paid $4 for beef that was warm, dry, flavorless, overcooked, and you'd get more beef out of a small Slim Jim Just disgusting, might as well have set money on fire, cause after I committed to finish the egg rolls, a few bites of bland noodles & I threw it out. Not even worth the calories. I seriously would have been happier & more satisfied w/ an apple for dinner, or a 3 minute Ramen Noodle at home.. at least it would have been hot, have flavor, and cost pennies instead of $20. Ruined my taste for Chinese food for a while. Honestly, I feel robbed, it was gross.  I'm not being a jerk or exaggerating nor trying to be mean. I'm simply stating my experience & the facts as they are, And if this helps the chefs or the owners, managers or cooks,  Or saves somebody else from horrible food way overpriced and wasting their time and money then that is what it is.  Most disappointing me all I can think of in a very long time especially for when I paid for.  I really don\u2019t know if people order to have a 3, 4 or 5 star review for this place,  But it\u2019s hard to believe. And I\u2019m easy to please I love Chinese food Cantonese Japanese Vietnamese Korean and Filipino all the orient flavor but it\u2019s hard to believe. And I\u2019m easy to please love Chinese food Cantonese Japanese Vietnamese Korean and Filipino all the Flavors if the Orient, But no I don\u2019t see me giving this a second try.",

Meat types can be eaten with rice or wrap, and a variety of Asian beers are also sold. \"Mak gogi\" with a bulgogi motif is a little short, and \"Geneal mak\" sauce is fine. If you like hot wings, it's not bad to order chicken wings with only chicken legs. The price is also cheap, and you can be sure that the cost-effectiveness is very good.

We ordered and I was asked if I wanted to add a tip which I did given we were eating there. However, all you get for your tip is the food brought to the table.  They never cleared the empty dishes, we had to bring them to the counter ourselves. We then bought another round of sake. They never came to wipe the table or clear any remaining dishes.  There were five or six people working and they were eating, texting, cleaning and NO ONE ever came to our table. Maybe I am missing what this dining experience is supposed to be like, but it appears not to be anyone's job to make it a good one.",

The staff is pretty friendly and helpful in navigating the menu.  The highlight was the chicken wings with a little help from their homemade hot sauce.  The sauce has a panda on it and that makes me laugh.  The rice bowl that I had was a mix of brown and white rice (my choice to mix the two) and was the General MAK chicken.  It was a bit on the salty side and not a far departure from the other general chicken you may be used to seeing on your favorite take out joint (you know... that T-so guy).  My meal was about average.  I'm a bit picky when it comes to my Asian food and I won't expect to find my next Asian meal in Wicker Park.",

The employees in here were super nice. They made awesome recommendations, and made sure we were 100% good.  The best thing about this place is the Chork-Chopstick Fork!
