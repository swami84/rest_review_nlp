A plate full of flame-grilled, finely diced, chicken, surrounded by hummus. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender; the hummus was nice, tangy and flavorful. If you didn't already know, chicken is an excellent protein source, hummus provides complex carbs and fiber, and the drizzle of olive oil is all about healthy fats.  For this restaurant in particular though, we would recommend sticking with the appetizers \u2013 they were good. The entrees, except this one, were just OK, nothing that would make us revisit this place. We had a few complaints about the service too. They had just one more table to serve, and still, our server forgot something and everything was moving very slow. Be prepared. .",
