Not mentioning that this would be information you would share to a customer as they arrived. I should not have to ask to be told when my food would be ready when I already am aware you're running behind on my order.... I ordered a burger and it took 45 minutes for me to receive my food even ordering ahead.... between the bad service I received I will definitely not be returning and I encourage anybody else to not spend their money here to such a disrespectful establishment.

And then when there\u2019s no answer and I travel to the restaurant Ms Lady is in the kitchen smashing on a burger. I don\u2019t say anything because I\u2019m hungry too - but then I proceed to call AGAIN! And the phone goes straight to voicemail. Ohh, sis is on DND!  There\u2019s an obvious demand and desire for Mikkey\u2019s in this area but you might be abusing that desire with this subpar service.  Food is consistent but service isn\u2019t. I love their turkey burger. And they offer The Impossible burger now, but it wasn\u2019t my favorite. Look forward to spending $10 for a burger and fry but nothing else. And you have to ask for condiments. Shakes can be considered expensive for size/quality. Sometimes I\u2019ll try to call ahead and they won\u2019t even answer the phone. Don\u2019t bother ordering delivery, it\u2019ll take forever.",

It's a small place with table seating for 10-12 and 4 or 5 counter seats. They have drinks (cans of pop, bottles of water) and milkshakes. The service is really good - food came out pretty quickly, and it was nice and hot. One of the order of fries in our group's order was not hot and fresh, which the server acknowledged\u2026so she threw in what looked like an even larger order of freshly cooked fries.

I got a 10 piece buffalo wing, it was basically tomato sauce with pepper sauce smh..not actual buffalo sauce. And the time I had to wait for these mediocre wings is baffling (like 15-20min) all the while the first baseball game of the season played on the television and dude was more focused on the game than running a smooth business.

Let's just recap my most recent experience (among the many many poor experiences I've had here) as an example of what I mean. I call over and over with no answer. When they finally do answer, they put me on hold for 10 minutes then hang up on me. Eventually I get through to someone and order a burger and cheesy jerk fries. They tell me it will be 15 minutes. I drive to Mikkey's, and wait and wait and wait until finally my order comes out an hour after I had placed it. Keep in mind, the place is not even very busy at 10pm on a Sunday night. They just work at a glacial pace with an IDGAF attitude. When my order comes out, they forget the cheesy jerk fries. I point this out and am forced to wait even longer for the fries. They hand me a bag, and I take it to go. At home I discover that they gave me the wrong order of fries again. The incompetency at Mikkey's is beyond acceptable. Spare yourself the headache and go somewhere else. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 star is because the food tastes good...just not good enough to deal with all the headache.",

My hysband went before and told me I had to try it. I went in today for lunch and had the Mikkys original burger. It was heavenly! The lightly buttered brioche bun was perfectly toasted and complimented the all natural, hand packed, Angus beef. The typical lettuce,tomato,pickle, oinions where set apart by the sauce. The sauce (i dont remember its proper name)  is indescribably good! Nothing like a bottled thousand island. Its unique and must be tried. The fries... wow. Best fresh cut fries hands down. The also have different flavors; jerk, butter, cajun ect. I had the butter fries for dinner.\ud83d\ude01",
