Oh and the cornbread was good too! It was moist and a little sweet. To drink we tried the blueberry hibiscus which i didn't like because it was unsweetened (my husband didn't tell me that lol). Surprisingly I liked the peach and cardamom tea. I don't even like cardamom. It had a little sweetness to it. I would definitely recommend this place!",

Collards watery and dreadful. It\u2019s like they did not study actual soul food cooking or spend time eating lots of it. And if the plan was to make it more \u201chealthy\u201d then you should not be modeling the menu off of soul food in the first place. We put lots of flavor in our food and we marinate it for hours and we use butter and fat!

When my order arrived, the popcorn chicken was overcooked, dry, hard as hell, and cold; the chicken sandwich was cold and cooked too hard, and they forgot to include one of my sides (potato salad).  I immediately contacted the restaurant as soon as the driver left and asked them to bring my order of potato salad.  A guy replies, \"I'm sorry, we can give you a refund.  The driver is on his way to deliver a catering order.\"  I retort, \"He just left, so why can't he circle back, pick-up the potato salad, and bring it to me?  I'm 4 blocks away.\"  A manager takes the phone and says, \"I'm sorry, we can bring you the potato salad later or give you a refund.\"  Newsflash: my family was in the midst of eating after waiting an hour!  I am DONE with this place and will not be ordering from this hole-in-the-wall ever again.  They need to bring the falafel restaurant back, or this place needs to step its customer service game up.  I can care less if you have one driver.  The fact that you negligently left my side order out and had the audacity to staple the bag solidifies your incompetence and ignorance.  Gnarly Eats has a much better chicken sandwich anyway.  I'll be calling Grubhub to get a FULL refund and I'll be cutting and pasting this true story wherever food ratings live.",

        "caption": "I stopped by this restaurant while in the area for an appointment nearby. I had been craving down home southern style food but I thought I'd give this place a try - soul food with a twist. The cashier at the window seemed pretty friendly and helpful while I placed my order. This spot is pretty much a take out place but there are some tables and benches outside. Honestly, I ordered way to much food but there was so much I wanted to try. I ordered half a fried chicken with potato salad, collard greens and cornbread. Getting the food home was difficult because I was so curious and everything smelled great. But once I got home to try the food my excitement faded a little I must admit. First, I'll start with what I thought was the best part of the meal - the cornbread. It was excellent and cake like but not sweet like typical southern style cornbread. The scallion butter was the perfect finishing touch but I would've preferred if it was served separately. By the time I got home the butter was all over and came through the bag the bread was in. The collard greens were delicious but in my opinion had to much of the sausage in one serving. The potato salad was very different but good however, it was hard for me not to compare it to what I'm used. It lacked the flavor that I'm used to in its traditional version. I had high expectations for the chicken but when I tried the breast - which is my favorite part - it was undercooked and the batter was still gooey in some areas. This is a definite issue that needs to be resolved. I had planned to try their wings at another time but after this experience I'm not sure about a repeat visit because the prices are pretty high.",
