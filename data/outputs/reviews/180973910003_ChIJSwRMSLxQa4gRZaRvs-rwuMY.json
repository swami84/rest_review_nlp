Then says I need to call and personally place my orders with him to insure my food is right (to me that translates into so he can spit or do something nasty to my food since he's calling me a liar).

When I get my order the delivery guy was nice. I get back to my desk and there is a big clump of mayo on the side of the paper and all throughout my sandwich. I called and spoke with one of the manager he refused to give me his name and then argued with me stating that it didn\u2019t print that way so it\u2019s not their fault. Yes that is correct I looked at the receipt and it\u2019s not on there however it\u2019s on my app under previous orders. That is not my fault it didn\u2019t print out correctly and when I asked the very rude manager to please correct my order and just be a decent human since this is not my fault nor is it there\u2019s but it was their company\u2019s system that messed up I shouldn\u2019t be stuck with something I can\u2019t eat and don\u2019t want. He finally after putting me into tears of how rude he was agrees to correct it and hung up on me. 10 min later the same delivery guy comes back and apologize for the error and gives me my \u201ccorrected\u201d sandwich. It was still not correct no mayo but now there was no cheese and hardly any meat. I am so upset on how management acted- I will never be ordering again from them and have cancelled our office catering order from them and took them off our catering list due to the issue.",

We love it but this year our downstairs flooded and all our hardwood had to be replaced. Cabinets and walls removed, etc., our kitchen has been out of commission for 7 months. So having Grub Hub, Doordash, Uber eats has helped.  Now there's more variety and convenience.  Before this the only delivery was pizza, Chinese or sub's from Jimmie John's. I'm sure after 21 years we have spent hundreds, if not thousands of $$$ there.  But I hate calling the downtown store. With few exceptions they are rude. Very. They used to try to say we were ordering from the wrong location. Then finally and  resentfully take our order. The food usually arrived quickly however and was generally good. We tip well. But I always dreaded \"the call.\"  I honestly don't get it. If you don't want to deliver don't make it an option. If you can't afford delivery drivers ok but just stop offering  a service that you make your customers feel bad for asking for.   I would have called the 25th and Meridian store they are a lot nicer, but this is not their delivery area.  But tonight did it. Yes their subs are good. But expensive.  Their attitude is not worth the food however. I ordered at @8:47  PM online to avoid talking to anyone nasty. It didn't work.  I got called by the store to tell me with great irritation that paying cash was not an option after 4:00p.m.  so I could give them a card number or cancel. At that point I should have. It was obvious they didn't want any more orders especially delivery orders.  But I gave them the card number. They warned it would take at least 30-45 minutes. The food arrived at 9:50 PM. The bags were soaked with dressing and pickle juice and so were the wrappings.  It was too late to eat them so I put them away,  it's doubtful they will be edible tomorrow.  Not sure why Jimmie John's has an attitude with customers like they're doing us a huge favor delivering  expensive mediocre food but they do. So good news one meridian street store we will not bother you again.  Any suggestions from other reviewers about where to get good subs.  I'd appreciate it.",

You can request additions or modifications if you desire, but the standard sandwiches, as described on the menu, are already good. One thing I personally enjoy when I'm trying to save money is the day-old bread loaves that can be purchased for $0.45 ($0.49 after tax).   That type of smart business decision allows the company to mitigate potential losses that would occur with having to dispose of accidentally overproduced bread. The company is capable of recouping those costs and probably even making a profit, and the public is capable of buying good quality, cheap bread.",

It took them almost an hour for my order to be delivered. When I finally sat down to eat, I was INCENSED to learn that my sandwich was incorrect - it had veggies and condiments, but no meat and cheese! I called the store back, and they told me they'd  correct my order and deliver it again. No apologies, no compensation offered, and they seemingly didn't care. After waiting ANOTHER 45 mins for my order, I called to check on the status, only to be put on hold for about 5 mins, and when the person came back to the phone, he told me that my order had been misplaced and that it \"should've been delivered awhile ago.\" He then stated that my order would be delivered when the next person left for delivery. I asked him when will that be, and he stated that he \"imagines that it'll take less than 10 minutes.\" Well, 20 mins later, SURPRISE SURPRISE! STILL no order and no sight of this delivery person! I'm still waiting! I'm about to cancel my order, demand a refund, and complain to corporate if need be. I will NEVER order from this location again",

I was so happy to see a jimmy johns here, and I called for delivery. The girl on the phone refused to deliver to a bus stop (???), so I gave her the address of the building next to me. But then I told her that I would need it within 20 minutes, as the bus was going to leave. Apparently, \"freaky fast\" means 21 minutes, because she refused to deliver to me within that time frame. Google said the walk would take FIVE MINUTES. Since when does it take 15 minutes to make a sandwich???",

The person that answered the phone could not take my order without an exact address.  I guess across the street at the Hyatt was not precise enough.  I love Jimmy John's sandwiches and I am so disappointed the employees at this Jimmy John's are so incompetent they can't even figure out where to send the sandwiches.  Subs so fast you'll freak unless you are directly across the street.",
