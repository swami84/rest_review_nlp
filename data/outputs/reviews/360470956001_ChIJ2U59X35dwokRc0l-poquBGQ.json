That's as far as curiousity should take you.  The curry is basically tasteless and bland. For those who don't know, if you've tasted real Trini curry, you can match it against all other island restaurants.  There is a distinct difference, from Guyanese, Jamaican, other Islands and Trini curry dishes.  That being said there are a few workers there who seem lazy and don't know how to prepare a roti the right way.  I visited there 2 times within 10 months, thinking my 2nd time would be more delightful.  Same bland taste like the first time, I'll keep spending a few more dollars in gas to drive out to Queens.",
