        "caption": "\"0 stars\" Horrible Service!!!!! No one there can give us a clear answer or even get back to you. Our wedding was set for May 2, 2020 COVID hit and we had to reschedule our wedding to May 1, 2021. Due to Chicago restriction we are unable to have our wedding so we had to cancel our wedding celebration at Pazzo's and they have yet to refund us over $10,000. Fey stated that the owners are not refunding anything at this moment and its been over a month. After a month finally Pazzo's manager called me back and asked me to call Pazzo's Attorney and there Attorney let me know that Pazzo's will not be refunding us the $10,000 because Pazzo's applied it as an \"deposit\" I explained that the deposit was $2,500 and that was not included in the $10,000 that we were paying towards our wedding. There Attorney also said that will be not be refunding us the $10,000 unless they find another couple to take our wedding date.?????  Wedding venue worst nightmare. Someone please help us!!!",

Being at work no one ordered alcohol, but whatever other drink were had they kept our glasses full. The food so abundant that no one had room for dessert. the prices were right too.

We were seated right away and the waitress was at the table within seconds with menus and taking our drink order.  She was back quickly to take our lunch order.  Then the hostess stopped by to make sure we were being waited on.  And that's where it ended. We waited a long time for our food, which by the way, was brought to our table by the hostess.  No one ever came back to the table after that.  No one asked how our meal was, if we wanted more drinks, bread, butter, nothing!!  We were completely ignored as if we were not even there.  All other customers had left by then (it was about 2pm) and it appeared the staff was setting up for a party.  After waiting patiently for someone to check on us, we ended up going into the kitchen to ask for left over containers and our check.  After waiting again, the bus boy finally brought them out to us.  We never did see our waitress until we were getting up to leave.  She hustled over to take our money.  When I asked her where she'd been/what happened, she said someone else was covering for her.  I've been to this location several times and never had such a bad experience. Unfortunately, the manger never came out to apologize or provide an explanation.  I would appreciate hearing back from someone with a good explanation as to what happened.  I hope my feedback can be used to make improvements so other customers don't get left behind sitting and waiting.",
