Lost my appetite going in and after getting the food. If my partner waiting in the car wasn\u2019t hungry and craving a beef pattie I would have turned around.  The restaurant was clean and fast service. At a time when we are demanding to be treated with respect and dignity, it should start in our own communities and with our own folks. I am choosing to spend my funds in the community but it\u2019s a turn off to walk thru garbage to get some Caribbean food.  Is it that difficult to partner with the other store owners in the lot and hire a lot attendant to ensure the parking lot is maintained. Young mothers with their kids walking Thru garbage to get food. What\u2019s the message to these kids. Do better!",

I love roti but the problem with them They always run out or don\u2019t have and it would be between the hours of 12-2pm lunch time. Although, my last visit was disturbing. There was a young lady preparing food without gloves with long black painted nail polish that was chipped badly. I wonder how much of that polish was in the food. I work within the food industry and by law no long nails or polish is permitted when touching ready to serve food.  I\u2019m unsure about returning.",

There was a customer there so I waited patiently as I intially did not want to cause a scene even though the circumstance totally deserved one. The young lady in the front came over and asked what was the matter so I explained to her what had happened. She called a  worker who I believe was the chef from the back who came to look at the food, as soon as he saw the DEAD BUG he started to laugh. Confused at this reaction I decided to ask him what was so funny and his exact response was \" WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO...CRY?\" This was so unprofessional and inexcusable.",

Sometime they have roti skin only but they don't have certain meats or the patty of you choice. The last few times I went to this store, I left disappointed. The staff is not friendly or accommodating. On this day in particular My son was sick. I called to ask if they had soup and the gentleman that answered the phone said that they would be serving it all day. When I got there they said that the soup was gone. The purpose of me calling was so that I would not go there in vain. My son could only eat soup. I asked for their manager and they said that they did not have one. They refused to give me their names but I went there on December 4, 2016 around 2:55 PM.  DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION. IT'S QUITE EMPTY.
