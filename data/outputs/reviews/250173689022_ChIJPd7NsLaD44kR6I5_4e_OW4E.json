Ordered a mix platter of chicken tikka with lamb tikka that comes with rice along with a salad, raita and salad dressing. Also ordered a chicken chapli with naan combo which is basically like a ground chicken pattie but south asian style, which makes it much better and flavorful due to the spices. The naan was very fluffy and soft and just perfect with the chaapli. The chaapli was clearly my favorite . Prices were very reasonable and hope they keep up the quality . Highly recommended!",

We really liked the chicken kofte, but the grilling of other meats was a little overzealous: beef chapli and both tikkas were bordering on burnt. Gulab jamun was not  the type we are used to and not what we expected, but it was excellent! Pulao rice and biriyani rice were very good but very similar to each other. The place is tastefully decorated and is very welcoming, and the staff is hospitable and courteous. We are happy to welcome Peshawari Kebabs to the neighborhood, and are wishing them all the best! We'll definitely be back! UPDATE 3/8/21 : We went again today, and this time, everything was perfect : the kebabs were juicy, the rice was amazing, the samosas were spicy and crispy, and the portions were enormous. Thank you!
