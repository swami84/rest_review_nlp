The soup was very rich in pork flavor and the noodles were perfect. They weren\u2019t too soft or undercooked. The only downside was that the ramen didn\u2019t come with slices of chashu as other shops usually do. Instead it came with ground pork and chashu has to be added on for two dollars extra. Another dish that stood out to me was the mini chashu bowl. The chashu pieces were very flavorful and you can really taste the smoke in the meat. The size of the bowl also made it perfect for an appetizer.",

When I got a craving for their tonkotsu shoyu, nothing else in the city could satisfy me, and I'd wait however long it took (more often than not, an hour plus from being seated) to get a bowl. I went back recently and found they'd changed their menu around and the tonkotsu shoyu (among other things) was no longer available. :'( The ramen is still pretty good, but it's not quite as good as the old menu, and I can't justify the long waits. The staff is really lovely though, and the apps are mostly really solid (I absolutely love the torikaraage, the edamame is good, the calamari is just eh and a little too greasy).",

I came here at 2.30 pm on a Sunday and the place was unexpectedly empty, just 2 other couples...both of them were there for the lobster of course!  As I said the place is very basic, not a fancy kind of restaurant, but that didn't matter to us cause the food was really good! We had the Golden Lobster which is basically lobster with grille cheese on top and fries. The dish is worth all the 35$ as you get to eat one full lobster, which is perfectly cooked. We shared the lobster to leave some space for the Teppanyaki Gyoza, best decision ever! These were so good as well!  Too bad this place is quite far for me considering that I live in Weehawken, New Jersey...but I will definitely come back to try their Lobster ramen!",

The broth was ok. The broth had a ginger type flavor - which was different compared to my other ramen spots. The lobster was extremely fresh and meaty. I also had a side of rice which was very moist and complimented the left over broth. I wish there was an option to order the noodles a different texture. I\u2019m not the biggest al dente fan when it comes to noodle texture. My favorite place to get great, flavorful ramen is Ichiran and this place ramen doesn\u2019t compare.

I was so glad when friends agreed to meet here on our first night in New York. Even though we had no clue where we were going or what the place was like, we set on our way.  It's a small restaurant in Brooklyn, with alot of character. Simple yet interesting menu options.  Sadly only 1 portion of the Golden Lobster Fries ( Which is what brought us here) so we ordered a few other dishes. We had to have some edamame beans, still love eating them and the Steamed Buns which smelled and tasted amazing. My friends ordered Ramen, and another meat dish and thoroughly enjoyed it. Wow everything was delicious. Great portion size. The sauce on my lobster was fantastic.... a few pieces of my lobster were not cooked properly but what i did eat was lovely.  #TheFoodMusketeer #TheFoodMusketeerEats #TFMRyujin #TFMTakesNewYork",

The mediocre fish quality is pretty much the only negative however, the pork buns are not fantastic, but I would order them again. Could do with some run of the mill sushi.",
