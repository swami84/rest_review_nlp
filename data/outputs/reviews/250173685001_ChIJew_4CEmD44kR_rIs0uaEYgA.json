If you're going to charge 26 dollars for 10 drumsticks at least make sure the chicken is fresh because some of the ones I got were dry inside and had an unpleasant odor and aftertaste. The drum legs are also big, the size of turkey legs which might sound good to average Americans but the chicken inside had no flavor since the sauce is only coated on the outside. It wouldn't be as bad if the chicken itself was flavorful but it wasn't. If I was the store owner, I would also work on the radish because the vinegar/sugar balance is off. It takes about 3 days of pickling if you're using lesser quality radish that's not sweet to get it fully flavorful and for the bitterness to come out.",

That being said, they asked for more info so I re-added my original review below that I deleted because I felt bad for writing it. I do feel bad leaving negative reviews so I'll add a beginning warning that you may like this location if you have never been to any of their other locations first.  I'll start by saying I am huge fan of Bonchon. I frequent the Allston location at least once a month but it's an hour drive to do so. Obviously I was excited to cut that drive down by 20 minutes when they opened this location in Waltham.  Unfortunately, I probably will not be going back. I got the soy garlic wings, the spicy wings, and the potstickers to go. My friend and I both grabbed a potsticker in the car before heading home and couldn't help but comment how unbearably salty it was. Later, while eating at home, I found out that all of the items were ridiculously salty. The items are almost inedible due to how much salt is on them. I mean, I was reaching for a beverage after every bite salty. In terms of texture, it reminds me of caramel popcorn. It terms of taste, it's like dumping salt all over a wing. Even the coleslaw is just meh compared to the other location. The spicy wings were actually alright but in comparison to the Allston location it just doesn't hold a candle.  The \"ADDICTED YET\" slogan being on these wings honestly just makes me upset knowing how much better it could be.  PLEASE do not judge Bonchon on this location. Go to the one in Allston, it is so much better it's hard to put into words. I still love Bonchon and plan to keep going, I'm just going to continue making the extra 20 minute drive to the Allston location.",

The thighs were so juicy and flavorful! Service was great and the staff were very nice. Changed from 3 starts to 5.*  -Old review-  I really wanted to give this place 5 stars before I've been looking forward to having a good fried chicken place close for a while. But they have some issues that I'm hoping will be fixed in time.  The bad:  First off the hot tea we ordered was room temperature. The hot water coming out of your faucet is way hotter than this tea. I mean what restaurant does not have the ability to boil water?  Second they got my order wrong, but quickly fixed the error. They did forget the appetizer until I asked them for it after we got the main meal.  Third the sauce was super sparse. I thought they would toss the wings in the sauce fully like every other Bonchon, but they barely just drizzled some sauce on each one separately, a few drops each.  Forth the person I was with thought the boneless chicken was super dry, but the coating was nice and crisp. My order was not dry. Maybe the bone in wings are juicier.  The good:  Even though they got the order messed up a bit, the server was very nice and remedied the issues as best they could.  The fried pickles were good and hot and the fried chicken was good overall but lacking sauce!  I just hope they can have a bit more sauce on their chicken, fix the small issues with service, and figure out how to boil water for a decent cup of tea.",

We came during the soft opening, so I just hope they will take this time to straighten out any kinks in their system and improve upon their food before the grand opening. I don't mean to be completely negative, but because I've tried another location of Bonchon, I know that it can be better. Edit: other friends have tried it after I did and agreed, even after the grand opening, that the food is not as good as other locations. However, the service has improved.",
