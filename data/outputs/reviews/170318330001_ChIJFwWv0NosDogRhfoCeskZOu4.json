I don\u2019t know if it was because it was pickup but it was disappointing in taste and for the price.  There were  two very thin slices of pork ( the best thing about the ramen and it could be because they get their meat from Green Street) and an egg that was overcooked for ramen bowl. There were no other ingredients in it.  There was also a thick film of oil! I prefer Ramen San or Stringz. Maybe it\u2019s better if eaten fresh at the restaurant but I wasn\u2019t impress. I may try it again once the restaurant is open since we live in the neighborhood and we like to support the businesses near us.",

It\u2019s very small, 16 seats only but cozy and in the basement. Gives a different feel which I liked.  We tried the shoyu (full spice) and the Shiyo (1/4 spice). The Shiyo was great, but the shoyu has a raw taste (it has soy broth). Pork belly was cooked and tasty, but the ramen options are limited (3/4 is pork belly and one is vegetarian). The portion size is huge and fills you up, but the ramen was cold, which was a bummer.  The coconut blend drink was perfect! Goes well with ramen, good alcohol content and highly recommended. Overall:  1. Personally prefer Ramen-San, they have more choices of meat/sea food, and good for ppl who want variety in meat . 3 dollars cheaper (but portion size is less) and the ramen is hot there.  2. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 3 hour wait or the extra 3 dollars!  But it\u2019s good to check out if u want a different experience and dine in!",

I had been wanting to try out their ramen for some time now after hearing from several friends how great it is but kept avoiding it due to the long wait. Well I finally made it here and we were told the wait would be 2.5 hours so we got drinks elsewhere while waiting. Luckily the actual wait ended up being about 1.5 hours.  High five is tucked away in the basement of green street smoked meats. The ambiance is super dark with interesting decor. The place is tiny with only 14-15 seats, no tables, all bar stool style seating. I got the regular High five ramen bowl ($14.95) with half spice. I was expecting the ramen to be out of this world after everything I'd heard from others but it really wasn't. The main positive was that I liked the texture of the noodles which were not too soft but more kinda crispy. But as far as the actual broth goes, it was really just meh. I'm Indian and can handle a good level of spice and I thought the half spice was just right. Anything more would've been too much and all I would've tasted would've been just spice and no other flavors so I don't recommend getting anything stronger. I really didn't think there was much complexity to the broth which is the main reason I even like ramen - for the broth. In the past when I've had phenomenal ramen, when I'm done eating everything else and all I have is the broth left I'm usually tempted to keep sipping on the broth cause it's THAT GOOD. But this one I had no desire to do so after I had eaten the noodles, meat, egg, etc. Also the music here is way too loud. I won't be back, this place is not worth the wait.",

Got the tonkotsu ramen added maitake. SERIOUSLY, IT'S THE BEST BROTH IN CHICAGO!!! It has so much flavor but (very importantly) it was not just salty like almost every other ramen places here. The noodles were cooked to perfect consistency. The meat melt in your mouth! The only non perfect part was the egg, it was cooked with perfect liquidy yolk but it wasn't marinated enough. The Yuzu slushy was a very nice add on too! Whoever made those ceramics cups is an amazing potter, but they didn't leave their signature on it. My goodness, even my burp was yummy Haha!!",

It came relatively quickly and was a great temperature. I noticed they forgot my egg and had to let them know and it was immediately obliged.  The broth was a rich, heavy, deep broth with a delicious hint of \u201csmoked\u201d from the wok hei, as well as a sweet taste from the caramelized onions. What a strong personality! The more I ate, the saltier the broth tasted. It was definitely bold.  The egg was cooked to the right amount and the pork was a medium cut in thickness and came apart as I ate it. The noodles were wavy noodles.  Finally, I had an unwelcome interruption when I bit into my noodles and found eggshell. It\u2019s an understandable mistake as the eggs are hot brined and harder to peel, but would you want to bite into eggshell? I would give the ramen a 7/10 or 4 stars based on my experience.  If that wasn\u2019t my experience, they\u2019d get a 9/10 or 5 stars :)",

Order the High Five Signature Ramen.  It is named that for a reason. Don't even bother with anything but that ramen. The broth is rich, savory, and full of umami.  The noodles and soft boiled egg are perfect Everytime, but the kicker is when you add their bold spice. The kicker is really their amazing pork belly though.  Expertly cooked, High Five delivers every single time.  I'll also add a quick plug for their coconut pain killer which add the perfect sweetness and cold to counteract the hot and savory ramen.  The one caveat is there are only 16 seats in the entire restaurant so prepare for a lengthy wait if you don't get seated immediately. Still worth it though. Just Go!",

You'll be stuck waiting forever. The place just so happens to be underneath another location. So it's more like a basement setting with the lights being a bit dimmed. Unfortunately the location is very small with maybe about 10 seats inside, which accounts for the lines. I got the Shio Ramen, everything about it was delicious except that their pork is very thinly sliced like a piece ham. A little disappointed about that. My boyfriend got the Shoyu Ramen with half spice. The spice gave it a nice little kick & it honestly even tasted better then mine \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I'll be sure to add some spice next time.",

Only 16 seats so I'm sure the place fills up quickly. They have great frozen slushie type cocktail drinks, I recommend the coconut ones. Servers were very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Reminds me of ramen places I've been in Tokyo with the way they have it set up. Definitely recommend.",

Tip: if you thing you can handle medium spicy ask for low and then adjust the spicy level with chili oil available on the table.  The suggested bowl is always the best, creamy, rich and toasty with one of the best pork chashus I\u2019ve ever tasted, literally melts in your mouth. If it\u2019s your second or third time, shio ain\u2019t a bad idea just be ready for a LOT of soy sprouts and a rather tangy taste.  Overall the best spot in town by far + the atmosphere is awesome, so bad you have to leave right after you finish ( because its the right thing to do since there\u2019s such a long waiting list ).",

The flavor is better than traditional ramen, the textures have great mouth feel and portions are large.  Personally I order an extra seasoned egg and extra pork belly with mine: yum.  The only reason I give four stars instead of five is that the music is too loud for me.  But I can put up with it for this ramen.

The broth is savory and spicy. Great for the cold Chicago winters. I highly recommend the signature bowl. Be sure to add some level of spice if you're into spicy food. It takes it to a whole other level. It is still fantastic without spice! My only gripe with this place is the wait times. If you arrive after opening hours be prepared to wait for at minimum 1 hour. There have been times that I've waited 3 hours, but in the end it is well worth it. Do yourself a favor and try this place at least once. You'll be hooked .",

Being probably the 12th person in line, I heard the people in front and at the back of me had a wait time of 30-50 min for a party of 2+.  Ordered the full spice signature bowl and it was good, as in mediocre. The dish wasnt really spicy (for hardcore spicy lover like me) as its not your typical thai kind of spiciness but more of a numbing spice which masks the taste of the tonkatsu broth. The noodles were cooked nicely and the portion size was big.  Giving 4 stars because I feel like the signature bowl would have been 100x tastier with half spice.",

The broth is rich and satisfyingly spicy (both half and full spice have that kick), the egg yolk oozes out when you bite into it, and the meat literally melts in your mouth. The only challenge is the long line - come early before they open to wait in line, or expect to wait upwards of an hour and a half. Service is brisk, and they do try to turnover quickly, but it's not bad and the food is well worth it anyway.",

My party was there about 45 minutes before they open and just barely made it in the first group.  Atmosphere: a dark basement with industrial styling. Almost like a coldwar nuclear bunker. There are two long bars to sit at. (Not ideal for groups or children). Stickers are all over the walls. Really has a punk Rock bar appearance.  Service: The hostess was pleasant. She was able to arrange the seating so our party (of 4) could stay together. Our server was great. She kept our water pitchers full and was very friendly. The food came out quickly. No complaints.  Food: The ramen was SO GOOD. I've been to dozens of ramen places in the US and this is by far my favorite. I ordered the Full Spice Signature Bowl. This level of spice is about the maximum I can handle without it becoming unpleasant or detracting from the dish. I'd recommend Half Spice to most people. The broth was what really set it apart from the rest. The generous portion of pork belly was smoked to perfection. The egg was soft boiled with it's yolk having a creamy custard texture. Overall the dish was divine. I enjoy large portions and was pleased with the amount of food.  Drink: We had the Coconut Painkiller. Be aware, the drink is served in a tiny glass. It's about 4 ounces. It was great though! It had plenty of liquor in it but was still delightful. Only wish the serving size were a bit larger.  Tips: Wear the bib. The full spice is quite spicy. Don't order the Kanabo unless you're a sadist. Arrive early.",

Don\u2019t come here looking for broth that isn\u2019t as rich as Scrooge McDuck (I\u2019m already sorry for that reference)! __ My wife and I moved to Chicago recently. One of the first foods we started researching here was ramen, because we\u2019re obsessed. High Five seemed to be the pretty unanimous recommendation across multiple sources, so we put it right at the top of our list and went as soon as we could.  As soon as we could was our very first evening in town, on a Monday. We went looking for the restaurant and we were just a little lost/confused at first, because High Five is underneath the inside part of Green Street Smoked Meats. You need to walk down the alley past the first few outside tables at Greenstreet, and then there is a door on the left with a handprint marking the entrance for High Five. You immediately turn left and go down the stairs to get to High Five.  So on this Monday, we arrived at 5:25pm, and were told it was going to be a 2 hour+ wait already, even though they open at 5pm. Psyche! So\u2026. take two! We go back the next day, Tuesday, and get there at 4:40pm. There was a small line already, about 12-14 people ahead of us. We ended up being the last party in the first round of seating, because there are only about 16 seats in the restaurant. If you choose to wait, you can sit in the bar area of Green Street upstairs, get drinks, and wait for your name to be called.  We ordered almost immediately upon being seated. I went with the Full Spice Signature Bowl and my wife ordered the Half Spice. We waited about 30-40 minutes for the food and then the deliciousness arrived.  I was in love after one bite/slurp. The broth is rich and cloudy. It\u2019s entirely opaque but for the little bubbles of fat. The pork was tender and perfect; it had a little bit of roast/char/smoke flavor and fell apart in the chopsticks. Eating this ramen felt like how I imagine McDuck felt when he swam in his money (I\u2019m sorry again\u2026 relapsed while reimagining the ramen).  The spice was exactly right for both of our preferences. The half spice is still pretty spicy, so if you\u2019re not into spicy food, I wouldn\u2019t recommend even the half spice. The full spice really builds up in intensity as you go. For me it was approaching the enjoyableness frontier by the end, so I would never consider getting the Kanabo spice. The menu says with the full spice, there may be sweating followed by pure euphoria, and, I can confirm this is a true statement. There was sweating, and there was extreme enjoyment. The portion was very large. I can eat a lot and I left very full, and the bowl only cost $14. Best value in America??  This was the best ramen I have had that was not in Japan and, yes, I know how obnoxious I am for making that statement. I mean this as a major compliment though, because it transported me right back to some of the best ramen I had in Tokyo, and it might be in my top 5 best bowls of ramen ever. It\u2019s just hard to find such a rich, cloudy, spicy broth combination over here. For what it\u2019s worth, I have a friend here in Chicago who regularly entertains business clients from Japan, and they always request High Five ramen if they can fit it into their schedules because it\u2019s the only place in the city that meets his clients\u2019 standards.",

Luckily, if you do have to wait, they take down your cell phone number and use an app called: 'Nowait' so you don't physically have to stay on-location.  The staff is super friendly and they even made an effort to remember my name, which I am very grateful for. If I bring or send people here, I always preface by saying don't expect a traditional ramen experience. The broth is very spicy and heavier compared to even other spicy ramen, but it's good -- it's unique. The soft boiled egg is always seasoned and cooked perfectly. The pork belly comes from Green Smoked Meats so it's good; melt in your mouth kind of good. I don't possess the culinary background to break down the flavors or spices but my mouth knows good taste. So if you're down for a unique take on traditional ramen, I highly recommend!  All in all -- The wait is guaranteed but so is the awesome ramen!",

We kept trying to figure out what the heck it was. It got to the point where I lost my interest in the BBQ to try to figure out where that smell was coming from. Turns out it as High Five Ramen and they vent out their smells right to the patio by green street smoked meats. We made plans to return to the ramen soon. It is no reservations and you have to walk downstairs into a dark and dingy room and there is not much seating in the dining room and some people complained of waiting a long time (we prepared for this by coming early). It was worth the wait when we tasted the ramen. I think I drank all of the ramen broth.",

Make no mistake, this exclusivity is by design. They are making you put a higher value on their food by making it more difficult to obtain. I'm taking off a star for this. Anyway, make sure to show up 15 minutes before they open and you should get right in.  Once you're past those completely unnecessary hurdles, you'll find that the ramen simply doesn't live up to the hype. The Tonkotsu uses thicker noodles that are basically pasta, presumably just to be different. The char siu is fatty bacon, visible from any of the pictures. And the broth is far too thick for how little flavor it has.  The ramen was good, 4/5 on its own, but clearly too focused on doing something different rather than doing something delicious. Combine that with its pretentious exclusivity and you've got a restaurant that perfectly embodies the problems with foodie culture. I hope your Instagram post is worth it.",

Even at 1130pm we (party of 2) had to wait 30 minutes, but it was well worth it. I really like spicy food and felt challenged to try the Kanabo, but our server talked to out of it, saying it's 5 times spicier than the full spice, which I ended up getting instead. That was the right amount of spice for me, and I don't think anyone would enjoy eating that Kanabo even if they could handle the heat because you lose all the other flavors of the ramen.

Bathroom is in the bbq restaurant upstairs. The pork belly is a deep cut and smoked from upstairs\u2014lean but melts in your mouth. Seasoned egg is a whole (uncut) traditional marinated soft boiled egg. Extra egg means two eggs. You can order the two cocktail slushies combined (last option). Do not get the Kanabo, which is about 5x spicier than the full space tonkatsu miso signature ramen by about 3 additional types of peppers. Full spice was fantastic and plenty flavorful with enough broth for my kaedame.

So, onto the food aspect, their egg was not soft boiled for the right amount of time because the yolk was running - not soft. I can also tell you that if you are not a fan of the thick wavy noodle and the numbing pepercorn ... try something else on their menu. Unfortunately for me, I'm not from the area so I won't be eating there again to give them a chance to redeem themselves.",

Once you get into a seat everything goes quickly. Be prepared for the restaurant being pretty dark though. They have ramen and alcoholic slushies.  The ramen is just ok.  The broth is a little too peppery.  The noodles do have a nice texture though. Honestly, the experience is just ok.  One of the few restaurants where you know youre just a number the entire time. You wait to get in, you eat, you leave.  Nothing special.   Note: The bar is made up of corrugated metal.  I cut my hand on it while reaching for my purse. They did provide bandages, but dont be me.

I honestly couldn't find this place and instead went to Green Street Meats, but as I left Green St. I noticed a peculiar door with a symbol on it hidden in the wall and went in. Did I discover the secret lair of some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Was it a underground government lab where untold horrors take place? Unfortunately, no and no...it's just High Five Ramen.  As I ventured into the dark depths, I realized it was 10 minutes before closing time. It was really dark inside, like a shady hashish room where you meet an informant in, but no smoking is allowed here. In front of me was just a couple, they were playing on their phones while they waited. After about 5 minutes someone left and they seated the couple. A few more minutes past and the host came over to me and said it might not happen tonight seeing how there's 5 minutes left and a full house. He said I could wait a few minutes to see if someone else left...noone did. I turned around a broken man, humiliated, defeated and left...tears swelling up in my eyes as the door closed behind me.  As I walked down the street, I took a minute to check my phone. The sound of a door opening catches my attention and the host rushes to my side, \"I was looking for you\" he said anxiously. \"I didn't want you to leave and found a spot for you\" he added.  We scurry down to the dungeon again and I get seated at the bar. I order a half spice Maitake ramen with pork belly. After a few minutes it came and looked DELICIOUS! From the seasoned egg, black garlic, to the pork belly everything was cooked beautifully. The spice was a bit much though and threw off the natural flavor. At the end of everything I was given a hot wet towel, ginger to freshen my breath and some Japanese candies.  Overall I would give this place 4 stars because of the extremely small, cramped space with no lighting, but because of the accomodating host it pushes it to 5.  5 out of 5 stars.",

How are people visiting the city supposed to have any? Here's the thing, I called ahead to find out about how they handle lines or if there was any chance we could get in. No answer. Left a message. No response. Paid $20 to a valet to get nothing. This is the third time I've tried to go. I'll give them an extra star for being popular. Good job.",
