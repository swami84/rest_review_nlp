I ordered the pad thai with shrimp the Pad Thai was sweet & red I have never had pad Thai in my entire life sweet I ordered the red curry tofu that did not come with tofu it was just a vegetables but that was actually pretty good the rice on the other hand was not cooked it was granny... I also ordered spring rolls and two of them  were spring rolls and the other two we're something with white stuff in the middle of them it was just a whole hot mess never again will I order from them!!!",

The flavors were on point, dry sweat Thai heat broken by bright crisp veggies and the tufo was crispy without being dry. The atmosphere inside is small but well laid-out with a very Brooklynish vibe.  I've been a Bushwick resident for 8 years and Golden Thai is our neighborhood's answer to the likes of Williamsburg Thai; excellent Thai food, at a good price and in a cool setting. I no longer have to choose between my love of Thai food and my hatred of the L train. This is the restaurant the neighborhood needed!",
