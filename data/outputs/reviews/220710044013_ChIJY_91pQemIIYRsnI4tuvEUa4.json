The Only complaint I have is they can put a little more condensed milk, maybe some at the bottom middle and top. And shouldn\u2019t have to be extra to get that. Just evenly spread the condensed milk out so one can have a taste in every bite. But other than that I 5 stars! I recommend this place to everyone! It\u2019s the best.",

The hours on Google stated that they close at 5P.M. on Saturdays, but the Yelp description stated that it closed at 8P.M. Hence, I decided to call the number listed online, and a young man answered the phone by stating, \"Hello.\" I asked if it was Sidney's Snowballs, and he ensured me that I called the right number and confirmed a closing time of 7P.M. I got there at 6:30P.M., and I asked the young man if it was too late to order crawfish nachos. He asked me what I wanted to have on the nachos, and I asked what comes on them. He stated in a rude tone, \"I mean they are just nachos... you want chilli, cheese, jalenpenos, or what?\" I was appalled by his demeanor because this was my first time coming to this establishment, and people serve nachos differently. Some people offer pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, black beans, etc. On the other hand, I opted to get cheese and jalapenos for my order. After about ten minutes, I received my nachos, and they were okay. They were not anything special, and they reminded me of nachos that you would get at a local high school game with cheese and small pieces of crawfish.
