To my surprise, the overall experience was pretty sad. The waitress was made aware I don't eat any sort of pork... So I made my sandwich and fruit order. The young lady burnt the 1st sandwich... She then took in sandwich contents off the burnt sandwich and made another but put pork on it... I reminded her of our conversation when I ordered and she took the ingredients off the ham which she had on the sandwich and was going to use the ingredients off of that sandwich to make another... Ugh! I stepped in and asked if she could simply make a new sandwich with new ingredients. Thankful she agreed, but you can tell she was not happy at all about it.. and did that. 30 minutes later I finally got my breakfast sandwich.  The sandwich tasted really good and the fruit bowl as fresh and crisp.  Service was less than desirable...",

Laura worked with us via email and helped us decide which foods would travel best and which ones needed heating instructions. I personally always go to Kuba when I go to armature, so when my grandmother told me her caterer backed out, I immediately thought of them!

I cannot find 1 positive thing to say about neither the experience at this establishment nor the food. We got a steak bowl, chicken bowl, two cuban sandwiches and two appetizers and our bill was $95! I would not mind paying that much for delicious and authentic food and good service, however we got none of it. The steak and the chicken were so salty, dry, completely tasteless, it literally was not edible. The rice and the beans were overcooked. It felt like everything was made hours ago and then reheated in a microwave. The only thing that was somewhat okay were the plantains. I don't know how this place is still in business and for those that posted here that this was the best food they have ever had , I would like to know what is this compared to? I am shocked! I doubt it was an off night as I see there are reviews here that are describing my experience exactly. To add to the horrible food, the staff was just as bad. Rude and they could care less about the customers. I waited for over 10 minutes before the girl even noticed me in the to go line.. then literally without saying much handed me my bag with my almost $100 order and when I asked if everything was in it she said \"yeah..\". As I started walking away I hear someone yells \"wait, wait\".. I turned around and it was at me.. they were still working on putting together one of my meals and it was not in the bag..  I would stay away from this place.",

Besides the food at Kuba, I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about the staff. They are incredibly friendly and accommodating, always creating a warm atmosphere.

The glorified minimal menu options were overpriced and sub par. The traditional Hemingway, well, my husband gets a traditional Cuban at a local gas station that tastes better, and El Ultimo looks nothing as advertised, more like El Minimo. I make better black beans and rice at home, these tastes like pollo tropical, and no, that's not a compliment. The food was cold, despite getting our cell number to 'text us when ready' which never happened, and was a long wait regardless. I doubt it would've made much difference. What would've helped is if when asked about our meal a more compassionate response than being turned away three times as if too busy to assist. This sandwich shop is not the one to visit in Armature. Your money would be much better spent and appreciated if shared at one of the other more pleasant vendors they have to offer. You want authentic Cuban food, it's not here.",

We crossed through a ton of states and tried food from local restaurants in almost all of them. Kuba was the one restaurant we couldn't stop talking about. We ordered the Hemingway Cuban, the Ropa Vieja Byo Bowl, and the La Frita Cubana. It was all so good. We got the seasonal veggies as a side and they were wonderfully cooked green beans (fresh with a nice crunch). The La Frita Cubana had so much flavor, I couldn't stop eating it. It was all wonderfully seasoned and cooked well. We spent the whole rest of our trip wishing we had more of the yuca fries. I wish I would have taken a picture - but I was too busy enjoying the food!",

We ordered \"El Ultimo,\" which is basically a steak sandwich with caramelized onions, potato strings, cheese, and a cilantro aioli.  It was awesome.  We split it in half and my half seemed to lack on the aioli, but when you did get a bite of it, it was goooood.  Everything came together so nicely.  It was hearty and cheesy, but still fresh.  We also ordered the chicharrones given that my fiance had never had them before.  I wasn't as intrigued by these as they lacked seasoning, but they were good; VERY heavy, but good nonetheless.  They serve a lot of them though and between the two of us, we barely made a dent.  The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the Dulce de Leche Stuffed Tres Leches Cake.  ORDER THIS EVERY TIME YOU GO THERE.  It is heavenly.  Tres Leches cake is delicious on its own; very creamy and sweet, but when you add the dulce de leche in the middle, it's a whole new world of flavors.  It is incredible.  I'm not a sweets fan, but this cake had me practically licking the plate.  It is SO good.  You can't go wrong with this place.  Get in line.  Order everything.  Order 3 of the tres leches cakes.  And thank me later.",

Every bite was delicious- fusion of flavors, presentation, portion, etc. I thought I died and went to Cuban food heaven. The only problem with the Salchipapa dish was that I couldn't get in the kitchen and kiss the cook! Service at Hemingways was great. They were busy and the service was friendly and timely. My husband ordered a 2nd Mango beer and I ordered a Sangria. The Sangria was wonderful with just the right amount of cinnamon and a nice sized spoonful of mixed fresh fruit. Great job Hemingways in acquiring a regular customer. We will be back soon!!",

It had crispy homemade chicharrones, tender pulled pork, a delicious aioli, avocado, and cheese on top of (somehow crispy) yucca fries. This meal was top notch. High quality, great service, and something everyone should experience. Thank you, Hemingway's!!!",

The Cuban sandwich is one of the best I ever tried (and there have been a few especially in Tampa). Courtesy of the staff was great to see especially in a food hall.  Will definitely be back on my next trip to Tampa.  Already planning a visit to the Atlanta location when they open Spring 2020.",

The price I paid for a Cuban with yuca fries, and a steak sandwich with you a fries...I wouldn't pay again. It was $30+ with a tip. Sandwich- Cuban was ok, pork was good, it's a typical Cuban (no mayo, no lettuce, no tomatoes) Steak sandwich- I do not recommend, you need a knife and fork to eat it! It was fatty and th flavor was meh, not worth the price. Yuca fries- they were good, but too greasy. The aioli sauce was tart and tasted like a usual aioli, no complaints here. I actually used the aioli to dip my sandwich and it helped.  Overall, if you want a sandwich at armature works, sure, spend your money. However, if you're looking for an excellent Sandwich...Cuban, steak, etc. I don't feel confident recommending this spot.",
