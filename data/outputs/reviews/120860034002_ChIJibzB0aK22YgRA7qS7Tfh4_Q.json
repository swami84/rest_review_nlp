The other option was to come back after 4pm but we would have to reserve another table. This upsetting because this was never mentioned beforehand then someone told to not worry and take out time. This was a poor first impression, another con is that parking isn't free on the side parking of the building. We were there to celebrate my sister's birthday because we heard so much about the place and the owner. We ordered our waitress was incredibly nice and she was from historical Overtown (also where my father is from) she offered us a restaurant tour as well. The food was okay a bit pricey for such small portions. The cornbread was so delicious that we ordered 2. The deviled eggs were good but the caviar seemed unnecessary because you could not taste it.

Last night we didn\u2019t have a reservation so I was nervous, but it wasn\u2019t too busy of a night and the GM is super sweet and got me and my friend a table right away. Every time I come it seems to be an improved experience. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu which is important. The bartender Chris is always super friendly and makes drinks based on our tastes. Definitely recommend for the vibes. The music/Djs are always really good. I recommend the chicken and waffles (vegan or non vegan, both are good), the blue crab spaghetti was great. I wish the chicken and waffles was on the dinner menu hehe. I personally enjoyed the cornbread, but can see how people may feel differently. I recommend to reserve if possible as it can get crowded later on in the day.",

By the time I left, the restaurant was popping with the most eclectic crowd! This is a super fun place to people watch. \ud83e\uddd0 Pictures can never do this restaurant justice.  You walk straight into an explosion of perfectly curated art, music memorabilia, architecture and decor that completely transports you to a happy place where you feel sexy, hip, cool and instantly hungry.  Well maybe the hungry part is because the aromas coming from the kitchen are absolutely divine! If you're an avid Top Chef watcher like myself you're already familiar with Chef Marcus Samuelsson.  His team includes GM Reggie Larose, Chef de Cuisine Tristen Epps and Director of Culture and Arts Donnamarie Baptiste and their highly trained and amazing staff.  Service is just right. I had Marcus' cornbread, the deviled eggs (please try!), an off the menu Heirloom salad, the Fried Yard bird and their tropical roots dessert, which is carrot cake with passion fruit, coconut, pineapple!! Trust me, my mouth is watering reminiscing about that meal.  Can you tell I'm in love?",

Shout out to DJ the bartender  Ambience: it\u2019s very loud, difficult to have a conversation, or communicate with the host or bartender. The decor is amazing, and the bar has very comfortable seating.  Parking: the restaurant offers self parking with a parking attendant who happens to be a manager with the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Flat out refused to give me a parking ticket when I asked for proof of payment, to a point where he threatened to tow my car just because I was asking for a parking ticket. The parking service definitely needs work.  The food: here is where my 1 star come from, I see other people reviews give the food high marks, but the food is unnaturally sour, my wife order the ribs which were so unnecessarily sour, I order the dark chicken which was highly under cook. It really tasted like honey chicken from a Chinese restaurant but just under cooked. For an appetizer we order the CCC fritters, which one was super over seasoned, and the other two had no seasoning. Eating the food was quite difficult, something I noticed is that nobody was able to finish the food. These reviews that I see people loving the food has me questioning if the other reviews about this place is true. The alcoholic drink are terrible. I believe the theme of this restaurant is citrus, everything has some sort of overwhelming amount of citrus in the drinks. Overall the food is terrible and the drinks are terrible. I posted picture of the items I would recommend you stay away from.  Overall: I believe this place can be something great but the menu needs to be re-evaluated. I alway give a place two visit. The first visit the food was horrible. I hope the second visit, the food does improves.",

We waited in the veranda for our table but the ambience and drinks distracted us from what seemed like a very short wait. We were seated and was taken care of by Diana, an absolutely gem. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and genuine. Now to the food. This was such a great experience and the food was superb.  We ordered the conch fritters for an appetizer, so good! Fried bird and Piccadilly spaghetti for our main courses. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The textures were lively and decadent. We ended it off with a specialty dessert, the hummingbird cake which I hope they add to their regular menu. Overall, a great experience with vibes and tasty plates.",

I almost went to the NYC location and heard great things about it, so I had big expectations. Being a comfort food restaurant, I was expecting that the cornbread will be mind-blowing, but it was super-average, so it started disappointingly. The fried chicken was the best thing there. It was amazing, really good! I wouldn\u2019t serve the pigeon peas with it, and they were too hard. Mac & Cheese was also average, and the jerk sweet potato was great! The cocktail was a bit off \u2014 too sour, bitter, and boozy. Lastly, for my taste, the music was too loud, you could barely have a conversation. The ambiance and the atmosphere are beautiful. They did a good job. And all the staff is such kind, fast, and friendly people.",

I would think that message should have been on the voice message for the restaurant as to alert patrons  that takeout order were not available.  I went to another local restaurant that did takeout order to save my Valentines family dinner. I know that Red Rooster is new to Miami,  but in this covid pandemic, it's better for my family to dine on take out at home than to dine-in only at your restaurantat this time..

The dress code at this establishment is casual as the hostess stated to me on the telephone it must be shoes, shirt, and pants. From the moment we walked in everyone was very welcoming and inviting. The entire establishment was ethereally beautiful! It oozed black pride with a modern retro vibe. From the music to the seating and wall decor, the place made you feel like you were in a dream! The waiter Isaiah was extremely attentive and upbeat. We ordered the share for two roasted chicken, macaroni and cheese, and greens which was amazingly delectable! They carmelize the chicken with an open flame and even cut the pieces up for you when they bring it out. I tried the lemonade, ginger beer, and tea which I didn\u2019t find tasty. So Isaiah brought me a lemonade and didn\u2019t charge me for the first drink. We also bought an overtown red rooster SnapBack for my boyfriend which was very nice and unique. I love that this establishment is black owned by Marcus Samuelson. He and his staff have done an amazing job with this restaurant and I hope it continues to thrive in the overtown community. We mentioned to the waiter that we\u2019d love to have chef Marcus establish a location in Atlanta! Overall hands down I would recommend this location to anyone visiting Miami for the ambiance, beauty, and food!",

Had the whole fish that was prepared like no other fish .. So good.. With jerk sweet potato. Also crab rice came with the fish. Red Rooster servers and employees are so sweet and kind. We enjoyed the young staff ( most college kids as I ascertain). They where well trained and knew the menus. Valet was easy and felt completely safe in the historic district of Overtown. It was our pleasure to Eat Local and we are planning to take the ride again to check out the Sunday Brunch soon.",

The original Red Rooster has been a staple in the heart of Harlem for years and although I never got to visit, I jumped when I heard that one recently opened in SOFLA! This location is a Southern/Caribbean/South American fusion!  Kudos to owner, chef, restaurateur and multiple james beard winner Marcus Samuelsson (@marcuscooks) for this beautifully designed spacious establishment located in the Overtown community.  Special shout to executive chef, winner of Food Network's Chopped and signature dish (Oxtails) mentioned on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" Trini born Chef Tristan. @eppsandflows Those oxtails bruh!?!?!? Cooked with love!  This place is beautiful and has a different theme in every room.  They have an ice cream shop, two patios, bar, picnic area, multiple levels for private functions, african american history/art displayed all over the walls, etc. We had a wonderful server named Andre aka Dre who took care of us! He's very knowledgeable about food from around the world and gets excited about food such as myself! Great staff, customer service, music with a vibe, fun eye catching environment and delicious food!  **Marcus' Cornbread w/ Spiced RUM Butter** Review - Jiffy WHO? Perfection... warm and slathered with the smooth creamy spiced RUM butter! Moist, flavorful, slightly sweet and dense. I could eat all night.  **CCC Fritter ** Conch, corn, crab, collard green togarashi + green dipping sauce Review - It was good however the description made me think that I would taste all of these items in the fritter which I did not. It was a good fritter but nothing special.  **Not your Average Fancy Deviled Eggs** Topped with chicharron, caviar...mustard Review: I did not taste it however my friend and her significant other stated that it was very good.  I decided to have the Black History Month Special Menu... West and Central Africa cuisine  **Smoked African Giant Prawns** West African groundnut sauce, petite cabbage , crispy sweet potato Review - HUGE prawn with a nice smokey flavor and yummy crispy sweet potato topping.  **Suya Grilled Lamb** Suya Lamb (suya is a blend ground roasted peanuts, garlic and ginger powder, etc) with Jollof\" broken ground grits, smoked charred onion, Get up sauce Review: The lamb was flavorful and cooked to perfection. Delish! The charred onions was an added bonus but wished the jollof broken ground grits had some flavor/bland.  **Malva Pudding** Red Rooster Style Review: Delicious! I can't tell you the amount of flavors this \"pudding\" had! The texture, unique flavors in every single bite, etc.  My friend chose the star of the show!!!!!!!!!!!!  **Fire Roasted Wagyu Oxtail** As seen on Food Network's 'The best thing I ever ate.\" Served whole, maduros, local bibb lettuce, truffle... Review: THE BEST OXTAILS I'VE EVERRR HAD!! Party in my mouth. This is the ENTIRE tail cooked to perfection...This is a 3 day process....Rubbed/Cured/braised in guava and red wine...star anise, sweet soy tamarind, chilis....black truffle and free herbs.....a side of the braising liquid, lemons, sea salt/smoked paprika to top...DELISH! The flavors were all over the place! This plate was for two. The three of us ate it and had to take it home. It looked like we hardly touched it b/c it was that big/meaty. Warning...$$$$ but worth it and its to sharte. We don't do this everyday! Enjoy!  **Mac and Cheese** Aged cheddar, chive, black pepper Review: It was creamy... gooey and had a nice crust/topping...If it was a little more sharp it would be top notch however it was very good!  Our male foodie had the ....  **Fried Yard Bird** Dark meat chicken, sour orange hot honey, baked pigeon peas, rooster hot sauce, pickles Review - This isn't your regular fried chicken. The chicken is brined in coconut milk, buttermilk and seasoned with an Ethiopian spice blend blessed with south orange hot honey.... The baked pigeon peas (my favorite type of peas) was a play on baked beans with a unique flavor. Foodiechews on IG",

But most importantly, the team (especially my waiter, Brandon) does all the little things that make you feel special.  Limited edition restaurants are rare but when they work the demand FAR outweighs supply. So make your reservations in advance.  Before leaving I booked dinner for my best friend\u2019s birthday next week. As if we needed an excuse to get the famous oxtail (only 10 available per night LOL - very limited edition). Go Red Rooster go!",

The food  was also fantastic and well worth what you pay for it. We had the scallops with the mushroom ponzu sauce, the deviled eggs with the chicharr\u00f3n, and the cornbread. All delicious.  For the main I went with the Yardbird with an extra side of Mac and Cheese ( Do NOT substitute the beans with the Mac And Cheese. Get them both. Those beans that come with the bird have a touch of sweetness that goes really well with the brininess of the bird. The Chef made it that way for a reason so don't mess with it ! ) Get the mac dude, treat yourself, it's just 9 bones and you can share it.  My girl had the Picadilly pasta which was great.  Our server Brandon was fantastic. His charm was natural and effortless while his hospitality was focused and thorough. His service was impeccable but it was his hospitality that really shone through the service. He made us feel welcome and he exuded a genuine interest in how our meal was going every step of the way. Truly an asset to this restaurant.  This restaurant is a definite recommend and if you have an opportunity to ask for Brandon I really recommend it.",

I was in food heaven. The weather was great. The band was amazing. And the food was exactly what I imagined and more. I strongly recommend the homemade lemonade! I ordered deviled eggs the cornbread, The chicken and waffle (it had a kick!) And the french toast.  Parking is valet or there's easy street parking right in front of you if you go early. There's so much more happening at Rooster that I can't wait to become a regular. Bonus: There's a cute ice cream shop called the Creamery adjacent to it that's incredible!",

You can tell the chef is a true artist an has an extensive palette. Their presentation is amazing an the ambience is great. An incredibly well styled restaurant that truly has a vibe like no other in Miami. Everything here was phenomenal.... tehe only asterisk here truly for me were the drinks. Although fresh an creative they were the least impressive things on the menu. Still my company enjoyed thier drinks so Im not taking a star off for this slight asterisk. Im stuck between highly recommending this place & recommending it to the squad. If you are debating this place stop debating & go asap before there is 1 hour waits to get a reservation here.",

The rubbery and waxy deviled eggs tasted as if they were made in advance and refrigerated for hours. (We were brought a new order which tasted exactly the same.) The ribs, greens, and steak were nice, although the potatoes that joined the steak were room temperature. The real issue, and the reason I can\u2019t imagine ever returning: the noise. The music was so intolerably loud, it ruined the experience. I love a good party, but not when I\u2019m at what should be an excellent restaurant and the music distracts from the food. And, to top it off, the mixing of the songs was so disjointed and inorganic that it was offensive. The restaurant is stunning. The service, as I said, is lovely. Why ruin the experience with music so loud you can\u2019t even have a conversation? I left the restaurant feeling bummed that my experience wasn\u2019t better than it should\u2019ve been. Keeping a restaurant open, especially these days, must be extraordinarily challenging. So it\u2019s surprising and disappointing that some really simple adjustments could have made this a much better, more inviting experience. I really hope things improve.",

Went again and invited my parents for lunch.  We ordered the Family Supper and it fed our group of 4 and we took leftovers home as well. The platter brings 8 pcs of chicken (fried yardbird & rooster royale), mac & cheese, baked beans, and collard greens as sides. In addition, an appetizer (we had smoked fish dip) and dessert (creamy sundae cup). Food was fantastic. Chicken was juicy and sides were some of the best I\u2019ve had in some time, particularly the greens.  What I enjoy most about this spot is how attentive and welcoming their staff is. First class all the way thru. I highly recommend everyone to try this spot.",

Social Distancing Guidelines were observed & even a Sanitizing Station was set up outside. BRAVO GUYS! This is a prime example of how an eatery should conduct Business in a Pandemic situation.

A) having been in Samuelson's Harlem restaurant and b) having been in the original red rooster that was a cornerstone of Harlem. Sadly, to say this experience was poor. The staff were excellent, pleasant and made sure you were happy and satisfied. However, what came out of the kitchen was no so. One order was chicken in waffles. The thigh was huge which created a cooking problem, the inside was raw. The pickled cabbage should be renamed the spicy cabbage and the syrup for the waffles was also too spicy. The other odor was Fried Yardbird. Again, the leg was huge and center raw. We need not cut the other piece of chicken.  Sorry but this  gets no raves for food but the staff were great.",
