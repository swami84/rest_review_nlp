I said why not, As it would turn out the best kept secret at Dekalb market Hall. relatively new, they pretty much started doing th pandemic and surprisingly they're doing OK. they are hanging in there. food was great. service was exceptional, fast ,friendly. and I love the fact that they are green w/there to go packages. I can't wait to go back. Love this place....\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude1a\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude0d",
