Then we got mchadi, Lula kebab (which is the best I ever had), Khinkali (eat from the top so you won't lose all the meat juice), and Khashlama (so tender).  This is our first time ordering and it won't be the last.  Just wish we can dine in.  It took a little long for the food to arrive, but it worth the wait.  Can't wait to order from them again.",

Nevertheless, they agreed to put us in and were serving one by one within next 1.5. It was a torture for our hungry friends. They forget your order, they don't offer water or bread,they ignore your signs to come over. Smoke smell comes in and out through dining area while cooks go for smoking in the back door. Overall not attentive personell. Unfortunately, even though their food is really good, I doubt I will ever bring anybody there again. Update: the restaurant replied to my review in a very rude manner with very odd reasons, instead of simply apologizing for bad experience. My reply is simple: we don't eat fast food at all and always go to places where food needs the cooked from scratch,. Please don't say that you can accommodate big companies of people if you simply can't do that. You don't have to.",

I was dying to try this place for awhile and finally visited with my sister. We order two soups that were incredibly delicious and rich (the kind a mother makes that takes all day) and instantly fell in love. This kind of food you couldn't even hope to get with the same feeling of love and home in the city (Manhattan). Maybe if you tried for above $24 you could hope to get a soup of that making. Just...so much meat and flavor. Beautiful.  I came here again for a family meal. They let you bring wine and there is a liquor store right across the street (honestly better for you since its cheaper that way). Everyone adored the food and even the lowkey atmosphere with traditional dances playing on the tv.  Other than the amazing food cooked with tenderness and love (please adopt me), the owner is a wonderful woman who we spoke to on several occasions. She is incredibly honest and will answer any questions about the food as well as talk about her culture, history and give suggestions on menu items.  I just seriously can't believe this gem exists. There is so much care and love in this place. You'd be doing yourself some serious self-care by visiting here and ordering a dish or two. (Also cheese bread is a must - I did the eggplant and mushroom one).",

The \"spicy\" is not heat-spice. It's traditional Georgian spices. They also enjoyed the meat khinkali dumplings (if you prefer veg dumplings call ahead for special order). Ask for the bread- it is light and airy and great for sopping up every last bit of food!  you like tarragon/anise flavor try the bright green tarragon lemonade for an interesting treat.

Later, we found out I ordered two entrees.  Their \u201cpotatoes\u201d, included with the entrees were frozen, crinkle cut French fries.  The lamb was gamy and chewy.  I couldn\u2019t eat it!

        "caption": "I ordered Acharuli and Khinkali. (Cheese on a boat shape bread with egg, and \u201csoup dumplings\u201d)  Food was so so fresh. It take sometime to prepare, but if you can wait, you will receive a big surprise.  I can taste how fresh is the bread of acharuli is. I believe that when I order it, they make it, and when I eat it, it was just out of oven(or another traditional equipment for baking that they use in the kitchen, you can find it behind the door of kitchen.)  Also the bread of Acharuli has a really crispy surface,  mix cheese and egg on it, or whatever you add on it, then you can directly eat the cheese or dip bread with it. It will shows you how great combination they are. I\u2019m sure if they make pizza too, their pizza will be amazing in Brooklyn as well, with its fresh perfect bread.  To me, Khinhali is like another version of chinese soup dumpling, it has also the size and close taste of handmade Tibetan dumpling. If you ever try soup dumpling you know you should drink the soup inside first, because if you don\u2019t it will be a huge waste and that\u2019s what soup dumplings about. You don\u2019t have to eat the small part of the top of khinhali. You can use fingers to grab this part, or like me, use fork, then you can drink the soup in a easy way. Yes, it was also fresh, handmade, they boiled it, the juice inside wasn\u2019t a lot, so calling it soup dumpling is more like an expression for helping people know how it is like. The meat part is made by mix meat(pork and beef, told by a lady, she\u2019s probably manager or boss) i can taste it was a little bit spicy, not a lot, just like you can just feel it included pepper or something, and yes, it included pepper. I felt the taste of it is similiar to some Indian or Mediterranean food(or Tibetan dumplings) . Maybe that is because Georgia\u2019s culture and geography. To be honest I think Khinhali didn\u2019t inspire me like how Acharuli did. I admit that I was really full after half plate of Khinhali, that might influenced me a little. I believe that chinese soup dumpling have better and richer taste. But yes, it is not soup dumpling, it is jus dumpling, the juice is comes from the meat. Not like Chinese soup dumpling, it has not Included broth, not steamed. Again, calling it soup dumpling is an expression.  That was my first time of trying Georgian food. One of my Georgia friend told me to try it then I went there. If you know nothing about Georgia food, google it before you go to a Georgia restaurant. Here is Georgian dream\u2019s menu. BTW the lady said they are working on it to add images to their menu, so i will know what I\u2019m ordering soon.  Acharuli and Khinhali is a good start of trying Georgian food, but DO NOT order them at the same time like what I did. I didn\u2019t expect their size, they are both a kind of dish for one person, but yes you can share them too. They are like two big bowl of rice in chinese meal, you eat it for getting carbohydrate mainly. Who will eat two bowls of rice without any other dishes? Don\u2019t make mistake like me. I only ordered them since I thought they were like appetizers, small bread and small dumplings, later I felt so so full.",

I didn't know of any Georgian restaurants in NYC until now. This place didn't disappoint, in fact it exceeded expectations. The vibe is very homey and aims to transport you to Georgia, and the food warmed my soul. My partner and I had the cheese and spinach boat with the spicy beef stew. We shared the two dishes which filled us up to contentment; we are no light weights!  Was hoping for some Georgian wine but was informed by the gracious owner (who cooked our meal and came out to greet us) that they are working on the liquor license, eta by Christmas. I appreciated the hospitality which further enhanced the experience.  Will definitely be back and recommend you try this spot too!",

We ordered khinkali and hachapuri and have been waiting for 40 minutes and then the waiter\u2019s boyfriend came and they kissed each other and he took a seat. Finally she came to us and took the empty can of beer and i asked her where our food was. She said that they were busy (but it wasn\u2019t because there were ONLY 3 TABLES). In 10 minutes she came with khinkali and hachapuri and my friend got khinkali BUT my hachapuri came to her boyfrind!!!!!!! I mean my friend was eating and i was sitting with no food. I got my hachapuri after 15 minutes. After that the owner came to us and that was nice. She suggested us coffee and appetizer as am appology. Appitizer was good but we never got a coffee. Food is okay but service is terrible!!! Will never come back!!!!",

Realizing it takes a while, we asked our server to box it for us and give us a check. In another 30 min our server came saying that kitchen is backed up and our food is going to be out in 3-4 min. Meanwhile, we observed 3 different cooks went for a smoke outside. In another 20 min our server came with only half of our order completed. She said that kitchen was super busy and they didn\u2019t get a chance to prepare our fried potatoes with mushrooms, so she only boxed our lamb kebab. She also kindly asked us to pay with cash. Thus, we have received a bill for $60 for spending 2.5 hours at the restaurant sitting at the empty table. At home, when we tried kebab, it was all overcooked.",

I continued with the Ostri, cubes of beef cooked in Georgian spices and tomatoes and it arrived cold. The place had a singer delivering mostly Russian songs... at a Georgian restaurant. The place still doesn't have a liquor license, so your only option is  to bring your own bottle. There's a liquor store conveniently located across the street from the restaurant, but its wine selection leaves a lot to be desired. I know for sure I will not be making another trip to Georgian Dream. There are much better offerings in the city in places like Oda House and Georgian House.",

Great place for families with children, students, guys/girls night out, and even a romantic dinner for two. Super clean, very professional, I just love this place! Highly recommended.",
