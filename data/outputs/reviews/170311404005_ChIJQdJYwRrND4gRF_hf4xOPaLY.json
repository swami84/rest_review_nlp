My first time taking food out and eating from this location as I am only visiting family in town and wanted to try this location. My family and I ordered food for take out cause of covid and all we understand the protocols of taking food out. Usually I don\u2019t like writing reviews when it\u2019s bad but my experience and my family\u2019s experience with the food we ordered was not appetizing at all after opening the food and serving it on a platter. Food looked old and unsafe to eat in the way that the food was cooked/prepared. The pork BBQ was bunched up on the stick so the meat was not cooked properly. The lechon kawali..well let\u2019s just say it was like scraps put in a box for to go. The sisig was very watery for some reason and tasted odd. The kare kare was probably the only thing that tasted decent. Overall please don\u2019t serve the food to customers if it is not ready to be serve. I rated two stars because the employee that took our order on the phone was very pleasant to talk to. Customer service on the phone was great but the food did not serve anything other than unacceptable to eat. Sorry Max Chicago. I hope to have a better experience for my family and I. I would ask for a refund if possible only because the food was not up to par to the company\u2019s standard or even as a customer as myself who experienced this.",

This is the first in the Midwest and we couldn\u2019t be more excited!  We love the hospitality and the food.  The fried chicken is what they are known for and they have many other popular authentic Filipino dishes.  When you eat the crispy fried chicken, it\u2019s recommended to dip the chicken in banana ketchup mixed with a couple drops of Worcestershire sauce!  The chicken goes well with their garlic rice.  My other favorite is the Lechon Kawali sisig!  You can ask the server for an egg to be added to the sizzle if you want to be a little more adventurous lol!  I also recommend the pansit bihon!  For dessert, I\u2019m happy that the Turon was added which is served warm with vanilla ice cream & chocolate drizzle!  My husband and I recently enjoyed the langsilog & bangsilog breakfast items.  The staff are friendly and warm!  I recommend Max\u2019s!",

It's alright, but definitely does not measure up with their Los Angeles and Las Vegas restaurants. The chicken was crispy but the meat was a little dry. Their \"sago at gulaman\" didn't look like it had the traditional molasses you would expect, but it was extremely sweet, I had to add a total of  two glasses of water as I was consuming it, to normalize the candied drink. Price was decent and place was super clean. Still, the place was packed with a lot of people waiting.",
