The brisket barely had any meat on it and was mostly bread. The cheese from the beef and cheddar was thrown on in such a way that most of it was on the wrapper instead of the sandwich. The curly fries were not hot, and the Dr. Pepper tasted watered down. Not sure what\u2019s going on here, but we recommend skipping this location in the future.",

The bread was dried out the cheese was gross and normally it\u2019s not but the meat had a funny taste. I also ordered a dr. Pepper and it was flat. The last few times I have gone to this location it seems like they have gone downhill. Sorry but until it gets better this is what it stays at. Also every time I go in they seem to have new staff as well",

Tasted like old refrozen ice cream was used. Fries were rock hard.  The lady on the front register was also taking drive through orders which is frustrating because she would just walk away from the register when you are trying to order.  I gave it two stars because the bathroom was clean and smelled like sweet tarts.",
