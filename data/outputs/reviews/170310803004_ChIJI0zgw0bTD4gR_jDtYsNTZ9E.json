We definitely have orange juice with our champagne - and not the other was around!  The food was the same basic brunch food that you can find anywhere. It was cooked well. No complaints.  We enjoyed the environment and the music was great! We occasionally broke out into song earning looks from the other parties trying to enjoy their meals. But we did have a couple of other ladies join in the harmony. We had a great time. I would recommend coming here for a lighthearted brunch!  Also, the bathrooms were nice!",

I would never recommend that anyone order from here though, unless you want to be disappointed and end up having to reorder up to three (3!) times in one night, and never get fully refunded for the inedible orders you receive. The only reason I give two starts instead of one is because, on the rare occasion that the order is actually prepared correctly, it is delicious.

While it is an all-you-can-eat spot, there aren't as many options for the price you do pay and more so you are paying for the neighborhood, ambiance and reputation of the place that is basically a lounge that decided to serve brunch to seem friendly. The egg station was a bright spot, but pretty standard. I won't be going back, but if you want to, go for it. As far as I can tell, there are only Instagram bragging points here, nothing worthwhile to visit again for me",

It was my good friends birthday and we wanted to grab a mid afternoon snack and some drinks, enjoying the lovely ambiance of your location and open windows on the second floor. We were not greeted upon entering the second floor or asked for assistance finding a table. Once seating ourselves, we asked the bartender to please wipe down the tables as they were dirty with food and drink. The bartender made a sour face and passed it down to one of her male employees, who I watched rudely laugh and discuss us asking for this simple task, he made a face to the bartender and then rolled his eyes while grabbing wipes to wipe down the table. He then came over and made the comment, \u201cI guess we\u2019re wiping down this table just to get it dirty again.\u201d The waitress was fine, it took us 15 minutes to get our drinks. Granted there was a bachelorette party happening next to us with a party of 20 women, we understand that there might be a wait but the service we received throughout the night just got worse. The food was fine, the French fries were the highlight of the meal. We had asked for certain sauces before ordering, none of which we received when our food arrived and asked the buss boy to bring us some. He never returned. We then asked the waitress, who never came to our table after our food arrived to check and make sure all of it was fine/accurate to our order, to please get the sauces. She never returned with them. In the meantime, the bachelorette table next to us received TWO rounds of sauces. After waiting 15-20 minutes, I asked another buss boy to please get us what we asked for and expressed my frustration with our entire experience. We then finally got our sauces and were able to finish our meals. The waitress was able to split our checks which was great and we left. The best part of our time there was the music, the DJ was great. I hate to be the person that brings race into situations, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the table next to us (Bachelorette party) was a table full of white women compared to our table which was mostly black people. They seemed to receive  perfect service and the staff was more than happy to accommodate their table which turned into a small dance party and loud laughing. We had no issue with the fun they were having but couldn\u2019t help but notice the difference in attention and service received. I will not be returning to this location and by writing this hope no one else experiences the same situation.",

The food was great, drinks were flowing and we never had to ask for a refill. Music was great as well! If I could offer one  piece of advice, it would help if the breakfast dishes put out were a bit larger. I really wanted hash browns, and each time I went, there was only a small pan and it was empty :( Other than that, no complaints! I will definitely be  back!",

For a good 5 minutes we walked up and down their stairs looking for a staff member to greet us.  After contemplating our decision to dine here a young woman approached us apologizing saying they were understaffed and overwhelmed.  After being seated we each ordered a shot of tequila and a pitcher of their margarita. We were eager and excited to try their tacos and placed an order for 4 tacos.  During our hour wait for our 4 tacos we were served our neighboring tables food. Our food runner did not address us and immediately walked away. I took it upon myself to approach her and mention at the bar that this was not our food and she may take it back being that we had not touched it.  I was shocked and utterly appalled that this food runner would serve these items to our neighboring table with no hesitation. Fortunately the table next to us did not realize the situation. The lack of concern and disrespect to the other table was appaling.  It was during this time we watched as another sever not only dropped their specialty tequila shots once but twice (breaking glass the second time) without concern or care. She proceeded to serve the half filled shots and neglected to clean the alcoholic consumed hard wood floors.  After an hour of waiting my boyfriend and I watched as the table of 10 behind us was served food before us (including specialty tacos for the national day) this table was sat 15 minutes after we were. At this point I was not only disheartened but disgusted with the lack of service from this so called restaurant.  I watched as our server attended to a young bartender who seemed confused as to how to process orders. I understand that some people may be new especially since you disclosed you switched concepts of your restaurant to drive business, but to neglect your table is unaccusable.  At this point I was livid and asked a young gentleman to alert the server we would be leaving. We no longer wanted our tacos and wished to pay our bill for our pitcher of margarita and 2 shots.  The cherry on top was her approach to Service recovery. Instead of apologizing or offering to compensate us with our tacos her approach was to drown our sorrows with another tequila shot.  I have never left more disgusted with service. I understand that you may have been understaffed or overworked but your lack of service and more importantly lack of empathy is pathetic.  National disaster day at its finest.",

Reservations available online,  but no hostess available in person. 2 servers came to take our order (no sections?). Watched a server spill gratuitous amounts of alcohol and then still serve the spilled drinks to the table next door. Meanwhile a food runner drops off someone else's food to our table and runs away without giving us a chance to explain that it wasn't ours. All while another server drops and shatters a beer glass on the floor... this is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. We finally get fed up with waiting and ask for the check sans tacos. No comp, but a decent apology, and a free shot of tequila to help me forget this place forever.",

Great deal for good wine. I decided to go healthy that night and got a salad, but admittedly had major food envy when my boyfriend got his Patty melt. Luckily he's a sweetheart so he let me take a couple bites. I would've eaten the whole thing if he wasn't watching :)  A couple other things I've had here that are super good: oyster shots, Mac and cheese, steak tartare.  It's never too busy, and every time I've gone I haven't needed a reservation which is great.  Knocking one star because my boyfriend found something the waitress said to be kind of offensive. Other than that, not many issues with service.",

Which is hard to believe considering this restaurant is owned by Four Corners Tavern Group. When we were there, they ran out of waffles with no supplies to make more! The dessert options, a bunch of different donuts all with decorative additions, assorted candies, booze infused cupcakes and ice cream treats, but nothing irresistible unless I am a child with a massive sweet tooth. Decadent? Sure, if you like sprinkles, candy corn, and jelly beans on your donuts.  Personally, the dessert selection, looks like it belongs at a mall or an amusement park. The other stations included a Bloody Mary bar, a Manhattan Bar (unique) and bottomless mimosas with assorted juices. The food is spread out throughout the restaurant, upstairs, downstairs, up another set of stairs, etc., which is risky when carrying food. But at the end of the day, I guess that's good as it forces you to work off the calories your about to consume and you possibly eat less because who wants to go searching for food and then perhaps your table?!  The food choices and taste was to be expected at any other brunch or breakfast spot. All in all, nothing special. Cool atmosphere and this place will probably become popular once word gets out, but popular because of location and the hype. :p",
