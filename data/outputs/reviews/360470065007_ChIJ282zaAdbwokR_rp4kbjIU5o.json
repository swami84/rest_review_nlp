The only thing I didn't like was the French toast is $20 for one piece. It was good, but $20 is far too expensive for a slice of French toast. Other than that the ambiance was great, the back patio is a must to sit in.",

We had a reservation for their patio space which is very nicely decorated (the owner/manager let us know that they'll be adding an awning next month which will be clutch for the winter) and the menu had us both wanting to try everything!  We ended up going with the \"best french toast you've ever had\" (it was very good!), PDQs (which were AMAZING) and the bottomless mimosa special ($25 for two hours + an entree which is a great deal IMO) and let me say we left full and happy! The waiter was very nice and very generous with the mimosas, the server explained everything on the plate, the manager came to speak to us and see how the food was and we felt very welcomed!  I usually don't ever write reviews for places, but this place really earned it! Lol I didn't even take any pictures of the food because we were too excited to eat, but best believe everything was looking and tasting great. I will definitely be going back and I'm excited to try other dishes/cocktails on the menu. 10/10 would recommend!",

The restaurant immediately had a great vibe and you can tell the ingredients and food was of the highest quality - lot of love was put into it. We came with a couple of friend and and were really impressed by the Pao De Quiejo, Fried Chicken Sandwhich, Picahna, and the Moqueqa(both vegan and seafood).  I appreciate that the menu isn't overly expansive, but instead they focused on creating the items they chose and mastered them. Drinks were also very solid and the owner surprised us with a free shot, which incredibly generous of them. Will be back for the Feijoada Sunday.  The environment was beautifully laid out inside and out with a real homey vibe. The backyard is spacious and well lit. Added bonus of having some Brazilian music play reminded me of being outdoors at a Sao Paulo restaurant/bar.  Everyone was incredibly nice, helpful and patient. Look forward to returning more often and would love to see this place at full capacity on a summer night when we're over this era of COVID.  Minor suggestion: I would love to see them add perhaps one or two more additional vegan options in the future once they are ready(no rush - quality over quantity) to provide additional options there for vegan diners such as my wife(Brazilian) and family.",

I've had the eggs PDQ benedict, the Chicken and Waffles and also Feijoads black bean stew (which is only made on Sundays and can be made vegan) and everything is pretty life changing.  I've also had dinner one time and the burger I got was fantastic!!! It's $25 and worth every penny!!! It's the best mixture of different meats that is sourced by a butcher  from around the neighborhood of Carol Garden. And made the way you like it. I like my burger mostly rare and it did not disappoint. That chef knows how to cook. The chicken sandwich was also amazing. Crispy out side and super juicy on the inside. Topped with a made in-house pickles and a spicy aioli.  I knew when we were able to eat at the restaurant, it would be a very different experience then just delivered.  The service was also very amazing!!! The owners come out and ask how the food was. And are we having a good time. And, as for the bottomless mimosas, they are not kidding. There are three different types. Ascii, grapefruit and regular orange mimosas.  You need to run not walk and make a reservation because it's limited table and it fillls up pretty quickly. I think this place will change your life as well. I love it here.",

I liked the eggs, potato wedges, salad and cheese bread. However, the steak was a bit overcooked and had too much fat on it. I think it was bland and needed more seasoning. It was also a very small portion for the price and I expected better steak from a Brazilian restaurant. It should have been the star of my dish. Other than that, everything else was fine and I would probably return.",
