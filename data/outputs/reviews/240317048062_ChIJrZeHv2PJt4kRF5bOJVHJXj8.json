I ordered the rigatoni alla caprese, and it was absolutely amazing!

Mondays - bottles of wine are half price. the staff treats me like family. the food is excellent. they remember little things like I like ice with my sparkling water. they have even changed menu items at suggestion. they listen, and they care. if you go and eat once, you will go back. decor is beautiful- so it is a great date night place, but i can also go by myself and know I won't feel alone or out of place. I usually start with soup or an appetizer , then do a half order of ravoli, then an entree (often a special) and I always finish with dessert. The pastas you can have marinara, cream or amore' sauce. There are a lot of seafood options, and though I do eat meat they have several vegetarian options as well. I recently tried their white pizza which was excellent - there is truly something for everyone",

Both from Texas in DC highly educated and starting their careers, both employed, and why should I have to bring up their resum\u00e9 to make this point. They just wanted to be seated for dinner. Why was this too difficult a task for this establishment. La Panetteria, you didn't just ruin Valentine's Day 2018 for my daughter and her boyfriend, you reminded us we have so much work to do to fix maladaptive attitudes that are harmful to our society and to your business. Because I for one will make sure everyone knows about your establishment for this racist experience. You will be surprised at the power of peaceful protest.",
