We walked in and there was no one around but the bartender so we approached the bar and waited for him to get off his phone. He then told us to sit wherever and brought us a water pitcher with stacked cups. He didnt even bother to pour the water. He proceeded to get back on his phone. We reviewed the very small menu and after a while of no one coming to take our order, we got up and left. No apologies for the horrible customer service. The menus on the table were dirty and the furniture was uncomfortable. Maybe if they improve these things and train their staff, I'd go back. But, there's other good food in the area to bother.",

        "caption": "This used to be my favorite bar, not just in Brooklyn, but in the world. Up there with the Brooklyn bests like the Bearded Lady, the Post Office, city-haunts like Bathtub Gin and PDT, La Loba outshone them all. They boast an incredible selection of cocktails, friendly staff and bartenders, excellent decor, they always play fantastic music, have reasonable prices, and are the closest quality cocktail bar to south Brooklyn.  All that's changed. I've been going to La Loba Cantina for about four years. I no longer live locally in Brooklyn, but I come once or twice a year to visit family. When I would come back - I would always go to La Loba. However, the last few times I'd been going, I'd noticed a change. Staff were no longer as friendly and down-to-earth. A sense of entitlement had settled over the place. But I was able to ignore this, given all the other amazing qualities of, as I said, my once favorite bar in the world. However, my last experience at La Loba was the final nail in the coffin.  I was at La Loba Saturday evening March 23rd with two friends. It took a solid 30 - 40 minutes for the waitress to take our order. The place was crowded, it's a Saturday night, and it turns out it was the first night on the job for our waitress (whose stone face belied a soul), so we let this slide. We ultimately passed a great evening at La Loba, spending nearly four hours there.  The next morning, I see that I have an email from my credit card company indicating there was a fraud alert on my account. I see that I have an additional $225.42 charge to my credit card. I immediately call the credit card company (at this point I also realize I\u2019d left my card at La Loba), to put a hold on my card, but agree to try to sort this issue with La Loba prior to disputing the charge.  What followed was a 72-hour wild goose chase, in which, after speaking with two different individuals on four occasions (one in person) on separate days, no one was able to tell me where this charge came from, or to reimburse me. The mythical manager, the only person who could reimburse me for this charge, did not show up the following Sunday or Monday night. I was told that she would reach out to me after I left my contact information, but she never contacted me. Ultimately it turned out, as I discovered three days later, that our waitress had erroneously charged my credit card for $225.42, a mistake she immediately rescinded (as indicated by the time stamp of the credit, which, nonetheless, was not visible on my credit card account for another three days). Despite the fact that this problem was caused (and resolved) the very same evening (Saturday), no one was able to tell me this, until it was made apparent on my credit card account three days later. And yet, I needed to spend three days following up on this issue, which should have never even been an issue, while being ignored and disrespected throughout.  There are hundreds of bars in Brooklyn. There is even a local bar on the same block (Hinterlands), and two blocks down, east of Coney Island Avenue, there is Wheated, which has an amazing whiskey selection, an excellent cocktail selection, and great food. While I will miss my favorite bar, and the mezcal selection \u2013 there are other mezcal bars in the city (try Chavela\u2019s on Franklin Avenue) where one does not need to be treated like vermin by a staff of entitled curmudgeons.  If you do decide to go to La Loba (for their excellent cocktails), then I hope that you have a better experience than I have had. However, I\u2019d like it even more if you decided to take your business elsewhere, in the hopes that they learn a valuable lesson: good cocktails need to be made and served by someone, and if that someone is a miserable wretch, they simply don\u2019t taste as good.",
