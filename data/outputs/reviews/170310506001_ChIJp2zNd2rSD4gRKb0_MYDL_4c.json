Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised! I ended up ordering two nights in a row. The massaman curry is so good! Such a simple recipe that you wouldn\u2019t think it could be made bad (but to my horror, I\u2019ve received it made with sweet potato before... so yeah), but the onions still had a little crunch and the potatoes were basically the potato version of \u201cal dente\u201d. The pad thai was delicious as well. Also, the second night ordering, they packed some free potstickers (which i actually ordered the first night and loved)!! I don\u2019t know if maybe they recognized my doordash name or something, but either way it was just really sweet and made me get all mushy...  UPDATE: Just wanted to come back and say that I also tried their Pad Woonsen Glass Noodle dish.... and it\u2019s so GOOD. Wanted to order for the 3rd night (I\u2019m supporting my local business!!) but they\u2019re closed.",

You can tell all ingredients are fresh and each dish is unique, not your regular american thai restaurant.  Presentation is key here. It made me want the food even more. Also, the decor was on point so after covid, bring your significant other for date night!  The scallion crepes were very tasty but also very oily. Even though I liked the flavor, the oil was overboard.  The pineapple fried rice was delish! The serving was a mile high. The cashew chicken was very tasty and you could tell the difference in quality of ingredients. It tasted like your parent made it.  The duck... oh man... it was hands down the best dish. I don't even eat duck and it was scrumptious. I didn't have any bits of fat and the green beans were cooked yet still crisp, just the way I like them. The green beans bursted with flavor from the duck. Truly it was a 5 star dish in my books.  Did we stop there? No way. Thai tea ice cream and coconut ice cream for the table! They make them in house and I've now found the local place to go for unique, fresh ice cream.  Their takeout game is strong, so be sure to support them to try all of this deliciousness.",

The Pad Thai was disappointing, & as another reviewer stated, is mostly just noodles. I added chicken to the Pad Thai. The chicken tasted WEIRD. Chicken satay was tasty, but over-priced for 3 small pieces. This is not a business that cares about pleasing patrons or about their reputation. And also, the servers are from Thailand or perhaps another East Asian country. Instead of treating patrons with warm respect, and gratitude for being in this great country, the United States of America, they acted is if they resented having to serve patrons. I'll take my business elsewhere. Not recommended based on my experience.",
