        "caption": "Considering COVID and we cannot dine in, one can only assume they are not as busy as they would be if they had dine-in, carry-out and delivery. That would lead me to believe that they would get orders correct more often than not.  I have only ordered from here twice and both of my orders were wrong.  The first one, I ordered 2 fry dippers for .75 each and I did not receive them. Even though that is only $1.50, the cost is not the issue. The issue is I ordered something and didn't receive it. My first order total was over $55.  This second one, I ordered one of the burgers without ketchup and lettuce. GUESS WHAT, it came with ketchup and lettuce. I also requested that the fries be well done, more on the crispy side as the fries were soggy last time. GUESS WHAT, soggy again. This order was over $30.  Why put a notes section for each item if it it going to be ignored?  Totally unhappy with the service. The bacon cheese burger simply tastes like a regular McDonalds burger, just way more expensive. I have spent almost $100 on BURGERS and my orders haven't come correctly.  This place is totally not worth the price! \"Wild Goat\" sounds like it would be a gourmet burger joint and the pricing reflects a gourmet burger...that's what I expect! Save your cash and just go to Mickey D's.",
