The beers to go are outrageously priced we paid 45$ for 3 beers to go. That is obnoxious. The only redeeming quality was the actual taste of the beer. They could probably afford to charge less if they didn't buy all of their decor at crate and barrel. You have a good product you don't need a flashy establishment to turn a profit.",

For a $11.00 grilled cheese sandwich and 1 small side it\u2019s way over priced for poor quality and small portion. My husband got a Italian sausage panini and again the bread was musty tasting and over priced small portion.",
