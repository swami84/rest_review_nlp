The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It is a whole fish so keep in mind that there will be bones * Yassa Guninar. Juicy, well spiced chicken  10/10 would go back. Outdoor seating was also nice (was a really nice day), and the service was good.",

It was my first time trying Senegalese food and I had The Thiebou Jen, which is the traditional Senegalese dish and I was not impressed. The rice was okay and the fish was dry. The gravy had an overpowering sour taste. I\u2019m still open to giving Senegalese food another chance but was disappointed in this restaurant honestly.

You have to go to a window to order your food\u2014felt like I was at a hood spot or a fast food joint. The food was overpriced. Worst of all, I later realized that I was overcharged. They didn\u2019t even give a customer copy of the receipt, very sneaky. I\u2019m not sure if they went ahead and added the tip without my knowing, but somehow we were charged $88 for what was advertised as a $72 meal (two fish dishes, one drink and one appetizer). On top of that, the hostess wasn\u2019t very welcoming and honestly seemed annoyed. We then had to carry our own cups, water bottle and utensils to our table. The table was sticky and hadn\u2019t been cleaned off properly, which is a big red flag, especially with Corona. It was crowded but there only seemed to be one waiter. He was odd. He had what looked like multiple Q-tips sticking out of his face mask; I guess it was a fashion statement, I\u2019m not sure. All I know is that Halloween was over a week ago. Furthermore, his pants were sagging which is not what I wanna see when I\u2019m eating. I asked the waiter for straws which I never even got; I later walked up to the hostess and had to get them myself. My drink was tasty but weak. The salmon wasn\u2019t nasty but was underwhelming. It was dry, not medium well at all and I was expecting a salmon steak but it was a salmon fillet. It had no seasoning. It came with a cold, sweet, tomato tasting sauce\u2014not my preference at all. The black olive mashed potatoes were fine. The kale wasn\u2019t as crispy as described but was edible. The beef fataya was pretty good, however, some pieces had over cooked fried dough that were hard. Though, it was still the best thing we ordered. The sauce that came with it was extremely overpowering\u2014way too spicy, and this is coming from someone who likes spicy food. My friend said her snapper was dry and that her veggies were too mushy and soft. She said the sauce that the fish came with was nasty and sour, she wasn\u2019t sure what it was. Also, there was a loud group of people just standing by the restaurant, they weren\u2019t even waiting to be seated. I\u2019m not sure if they were friends with the owner or something but it was very tacky and concerning during COVID. This was my first time trying Senegalese food, I heard it was good. I was disappointed in this place, but I am open to trying other places in the future. Overall, it was a lackluster experience at this restaurant and I would not recommend. It didn\u2019t seem that authentic to me. This place was trash and I would never come back and will warn my friends and peers to avoid it.",

We had the hummus vert as the app and it was really tasty. She had the thiebou Jen - while it wasn't a whole fish, she felt that it was all very flavorful, especially the rice and the cabbage. The fish was seasoned well, a little over for her tastes but only slightly. I had the dibi senegal - well seasoned and flavorful, a little over but only slightly. For drinks I had the marche rue dix which was really good and she had the hibiscus juice which was solid. The chocolate lava cake was good too. Our server was pleasant.  Overall, recommended.

Unfortunately, that excitement soon went away.  The food we received tasted nothing like the Senegalese food I had and loved in the past. We left all our food uneaten after a few bites. However,  things got much worse when I took a bite of my lamb dibi and found hair in my food. I was disgusted.  We waited and waited for our waiter to return and when that never happened we left. I felt sick to my stomach and couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Unfortunately, this restaurant forces you to pay for your meal before you receive it, even for dine-in, so they already had my payment.  I immediately, after leaving, called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, who accused me of putting my own hair in the food and refused to refund the charge for our meal, even with photographic proof and a note on the receipt concerning the hair.  This was a horrible dining and customer service experience.",

The food is great, the atmosphere is ok, it can be a bit cramped and bit hot in the summer, and yet with the additional outdoor seating there tends to be a wait at dinnertime. It\u2019s worth it though. I love the veggie fataya, the sauce that comes with it is spicy and delicious. My girlfriend loves the Senagalese Spring Rolls. The Branzino Grille is a must try and will keep you coming back - I\u2019ve gone and they\u2019ve run out due to its popularity. The Thiebou Jen is also very good and spicy, as is the Spiced African stew. Drinks consistently disappoint though, never strong or tasty. Music is usually good too. It\u2019s great for friends and okay for dates, the family style seating in the middle of the restaurant isn\u2019t ideal. Service will vary unfortunately but it\u2019s generally ok.",
