She sold the restaurant recently and is now working with her daughter Snow. Therefore, we are going to get treated to her marvelous food!  The variety of bahn mi are delicious, the cold cut bahn mi even has house made pate. My favorite is the grilled pork bahn mi, with fresh and crunchy veggies... the bahn mi rolls are crispy and delectable... great for a quick lunch and accompanied with a Thai Iced Tea or iced Viet coffee is perfection.  The shrimp summer rolls (2) are tasty and go well as a starter. The steamed buns stuffed with pork and a quail egg are satisfyingly delicious.  The other daughter Tran has the Pho Shop upstairs at the Monument Sq Market... yummy food and friendly employees.  I admire their hard work and dedication to their customers...and me, being their #1 fan..., wish them all the best for future success. It's also OK to let them know that Steve sent you...
