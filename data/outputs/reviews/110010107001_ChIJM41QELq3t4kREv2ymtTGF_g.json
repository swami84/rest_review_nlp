Chalin's is  worthy of ALMOST 4 stars with an A atmosphere, A service and B - food.  The atmosphere is quiet, cozy and pleasant.  Raised views, comfortable seating and rustin chinese art make for a very enjoyable experience.  The servers are accommodating, fast, polite and very respectful - you feel like a guest, more than a customer.  The food - excellent hot n sour soup, tangy with just enough spice and very hearty.  Next I tried the  vegetable dumplings steamed.  They were plump, great texture but lacked flavor.  The veggie filling needs independent seasoning.  They were satisfying with tons of sauce.  Entree was \"mushroom chicken.\"  The white sauce was surprising good but the dishes components weren't that exciting.  It was cooked well but the mushroom needed to shine, adding deep mushroom flavor to the sauce would have been great.  Still, I enjoyed the dinner.  Most certainly try Chalins, just be prepared to add a sauce or two.",

The restaurant serves very good food. I had taken several Chinese friends and they all agree that the food quality is great. Being a vegetarian, they were also able to cater to my dietary needs. My family on the other hand, eat chicken and fish and they love it as well.  The service is rather robotic. If you are going for a pleasant table waiting experience and someone to help you with the menu, you may walk away with a sense of want  Having said that, every time we visit DC and are in the mood for good Chinese food, this restaurant will be on top of our list.

My co-worker ordered her usual meal from this location, which are the Singapore-style noodles, I say usual as she has ordered this meal on several occasions. A very loyal customer if you ask me. She met the delivery driver outside of our place of business where he attempted to raise his voice in a very rude demeanor as he was upset that he had to double park. Word of Advice to the restaurant manager: we are located in Downtown Washington, DC. Delivery drivers unfortunately have to double park when making deliveries as we are a very overpopulated city; this isn't an uncommon issue, and it for sure isn't the problem of your customers. If double parking is an issue, I would recommend relocating to a more suburban area. After this unfortunate incident, my co-worker went ahead and made another lunch order on a later date where she tried something new, the kung pao chicken and shrimp, unfortunately she couldn't leave a review on the taste and quality as when she went to take her first bite she found a staple in her food. Yes, A Staple! The little small piece of metal that is used to hold multiple papers together, found in her food! Save yourself the trouble dear and just eat somewhere else.",

When the food is good, it's great for the price and taste (4 star worthy). But when it's bad,  the food quality is enough to make you wonder if this place even deserves 1 star.  Yesterday evening was my latest (and last) order - the sesame chicken was purely disgusting, unrecognizable as a dish. Each bite of the chicken left a mildly bitter after taste, reminiscent of rancid oil used to cook other meats or seafoods. The breading of the chicken was very thin and almost non-existent. It almost appeared like the breading was watered down severely perhaps in a last ditch effort to stretch out ingredients. The typical sweet flavor of Sesame chicken sauce was not there. My date got the Singapore noodles and the noodles tasted slimy, with some sort of burnt after taste.  Like I said though, on some occasions the food has been good. But when the above example happens, it makes you wonder why you are shelling out $14 for one dish that you barely ate, threw out and nearly vomited while sampling. To be clear, variations of the above example have happened on some other orders of Sesame Chicken, so the above incident is not isolated or an exception.  Please improve your sesame chicken and don't use old oil, or at least check to make sure the ingredients used are fresh and that the dish is acceptable tasting before serving to customers.",
