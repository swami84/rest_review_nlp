They served my party a buffet that consisted of meatballs, chicken, potatoes, salads, and a dessert of cookies. I served myself a meatball with a piece of chicken breast, some of the potatoes and the salad, thus a cookie. First, I was disappointed when I discovered that most of the food tasted inadequate, which includes the chicken, the potatoes, and the cookies. The chicken tasted a bit bland, and it seemed grilled, yet definitely did not taste like it. The chicken was also squishy and didn't have an exquisite taste. As for the potatoes, well that is another issue in itself. The potatoes were extremely bland, they had no absolute flavor from no seasoning at all. At last, the cookie was quite a disappointment in itself, I mean how can you possibly mess up a cookie? The cookie was extremely stiff, either it was old or it was just burned. Finally,  I attended this dinner trip with friends and some of them just had to share what they thought of this location. My friend that accompanied me stated that , \"it [the food] was horrible, it tasted cold and slimey.\" Another friend explained that, \" the chicken was too buttery.\" As for the cookie, \" another friend explained the cookie as, \" extremely dissatisfaction by how stiff it was.\" At last, a friend gave me an overall view of their experience, \" The chicken breast was-like- soggy and it felt a little bit uncooked, while the meatballs looked rubbery for some reason; and the cookie looked 2 weeks old, I brought cookies on the trip that looked better than that, so no it was disgusting, their salad was alright though\". As explained by many sources, this food is definitely not the best they could have done. I believe this synthetic food lacked effort, and that if effort was applied, the food would be 100% better.",

I told her that I didn't even noticed and didn't understand why I was being charged for a tip where no special service was provided (since I grabbed my own OJ, and why would I tip someone for doing their job?

Well, why does the system automatically charges 18% as opposed to 15% or 10%? There was no sign alerting customers of an automatic tip charged, and the cashier did not mention it either.  How many people have they robbed? Especially since most people buying in the morning go in and out because they're heading to work, and most people are in a hurry.  I don't doubt their pastries and food is good, but I certainly will NOT be going back to a place that robs their clients, no matter how good their food may be.

Perhaps if I had been seated inside the restaurant instead of out in the courtyard of the building, maybe if I had ordered something besides the beef Bourguignon, maybe if I had something other than a butter knife to try to cut into the bread bowl, or if there was more actual beef, maybe I wouldn't have left the restaurant still hungry and in a funk.

Not the influx of outstanding lunch food trucks over the past few years, or new bars, or sit-down lunch spots. I just can't understand how they stay in business.  Slow, inattentive service by staff who seem to not understand the meaning of waiting tables or being friendly. The food couldn't be less generic, flavorless, or inspiring... This is like a Gordon Ramsey  restaurant nightmare  episode where the owners probably swear that nothing needs to change, because  nothing has ever changed. Come after work, I've been ignored for over 15 from the time I sat down, with the place more than half empty.  I avoid this place at all costs if I can. There are way better places to spend your money opening up all over the place down here. I hope, eventually, they'll figure out how to run a business with a little more of a customer service focus, and a focus on salads that not made from iceburg lettuce and food with flavorless ingredients, soggy sandwiches, limp french fries...
