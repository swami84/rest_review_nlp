This is far from an understatement on July 23rd, 2019 the owner made a vicious plot to not pay production team for a project she hired us for for her child in her club. She is completely unprofessional and not trust worthy if you that desperate for a job or to bartend there will be a nice place in hell for you once you are done no one should sell their sole for money. She brags about being a boss from new York who gets her hands dirty. She is a criminal and a schemer she has lovely children but the owner needs help off the liquor and a few prayers. The police where also called because she put her hands on the person she hired and urged security to remove her. Even the police stated it was unlawful and charges should be pressed. We not hot so that didn\u2019t happen. She loves to feed you for your compensation but we have children and dreams to pay. It\u2019s very disheartening because Jade Alexis is a star and has a momager who just in the way. I wish she stop with the infidelity on her husband with silent owner Russ from  oyster bar 4EY the future old manager just a group of bad grimy people. If you have a good heart and soul stay away if you can dance with evil this is the place for you.",

So I talk to the so called owner (scam artist) who I gave my cash to the day before, asking why I was never told about the 90\u2019s party especially since I asked what type of music. She had no answer for me. I ask for my money back and was told no. She was rude loud and keep trying to belittle me as if this was my fault.
