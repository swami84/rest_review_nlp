My suggestion to Kenny's is stop delivering food if their is a problem with credit cards or don't take them at all cash only business.  You should be ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR WASTING FOOD.

Driver refused to give me my receipt until I provided him with a tip which angered me even more so I ended up not giving him anything and he told me not to order from there again. Which is fine because I never intended to. All I can say was that I was BAFFLED by the horrible service and would NOT recommend Kennys what's so ever.  All events took place in Gaithersburg.  P.s they don't even have mambo sauce -_-",
