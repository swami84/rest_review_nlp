My a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl was mediocre and the service was atrocious. I waited 15 minutes for my one uncomplicated bowl with some of the fewest ingredients-the first item on a very extensive, tiny print menu board.  Two women ordered a few minutes after  me  -otherwise place was very quiet.  Two women in the kitchen and a cashier who kept disappearing into the kitchen while I was waiting -I am assuming not wanting to answer the question \u201cwhere is my bowl?\u201d  ( I go to Luvabowl in Johns creek when it is incredibly busy and have never waited longer than 5 minutes).  The cashier told me since they use fresh ingredients it takes quite a while to make.  Meanwhile i notice the ladies who ordered after  me are seated and enjoying their a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl lunches.  After 15 minutes I suggested that he return my money ($11.30) and call it a day.  Without responding, he disappeared into the kitchen and stood there for a while (there is a window so i could see him just standing there and two other ladies doing something else) and finally one of the women came out and basically shoved a to-go cup in my hands.  Then she asked me if I wanted it \u201cto go.\u201d  I did not order it \u201cto go\u201d but certainly was not going to ask for it to be moved to a bowl.  Received no apology but did receive complete disinterest.  I will not return, obviously.  With as many of these style restaurants popping up, I suggest you try a different one.",
