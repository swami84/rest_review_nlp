We walked in go Sette Osteria, and the lighting was bright enough to see (what wants to eat in the dark??) but still warm & soft, and the music was gently playing, creating a really comforting ambiance that supported a romantic date (\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), friends hanging out (there were several groups), a few solo diners (a good book and some homemade pasta? Yes please!) and diners of all ages (as a mom, I always appreciate when a restaurant is willing to accommodate a baby). All that to say, 12/10 for the environment. The food was also excellent. I had homemade pasta, and my husband had the pizza- neither of us could finish because the portions were large. I\u2019d want to come back and plan to split more things (like the cheese board and a dessert!). The wine recommendation was also \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. Our waiter helped us pick our meals and then recommended a wine that ended up not even being on the menu yet, but it was reasonably priced and paired really well. The most important thing to me was that there was someone who walked around with a pitcher of water making sure no one\u2019s glasses were ever even close to empty. I really judge a restaurant by how long it takes to refill my glass (I\u2019m a breastfeeding mom so I drink a lot of water!), and I really appreciate when restaurants prioritize water refills well.",

For my wife's birthday they brought us a slice of tiramisu that put a smile on our faces. The ambience in the restaurant was perfect.

We notice that one of the bowls is dirty with a green sauce, and there's a kind of piece of shrimp attached to it (see the attached picture). After a while the waitress arrives with just one pizza, and we point out the incident. She returns with the same little bowls, lightly cleaned but always dirty, and does not even clean the table. She asks us: do you need anything else? And we: yes, we are waiting for the second pizza. After 20 minutes the pizza still does not arrive, and I start to get impatient. The head waiter approaches to ask if everything was fine, and I point out that we had ordered two pizza, not just one. After another 20 minutes, my pizza had not arrived yet. I call the waitress again, and she asks me: do you want pizza or salad? And me: pizza, pizza! After another 20 minutes we are still there, and I ask the waitress to bring us the bill because I had enough to wait. I had to ask for the bill a second time, because it did not arrive. In the end, another waiter arrived and brought us the bill of two pizzas, although only one came. The second pizza on the bill was not even the one I ordered. Obviously we asked to pay only one pizza, since the second one had never arrived. And so we left. The worst thing is that nobody apologized. The worst experience in a restaurant, unfortunately you can not give negative scores ... I forgot: the pizza was not even decent (probably a frozen pizza).",

I asked politely for Italian bread and butter to go with my spaghetti and they said that's all they serve. No Italian bread.  Forget that. What a disappointment. The only upside to the spaghetti and meatballs is that for 16 bucks they didn't bring you very much,  so it was over with pretty quickly. If you want spaghetti and meatballs go to a real Italian restaurant. Ruffino's in North Arlington. And yes, they have Italian bread. They even have garlic bread!",

The only down side was desert, the \"made to order\" chocolate cake was delivered in less than five mins and was room temperature except for a small warm spot. The apple tart was also cold and not particularly appealing.  To the wait staff's credit they noticed the half eaten desert (my wife later called it \"not worth the calories\") and offered a replacement and an authentic apology. The desert was removed from the bill without any action from us.  So, great dinner, perfect service but skip dessert.  Well be back.",

From the moment we sat down, we could tell that our waitress, Karla F, was irritated about something. She was very curt to us, and ignored our request for bread for the table multiple times. We had ordered two bottles of prosecco at this point and were waiting for a friend to arrive, so we had ordered the bread and water and some appetizers. However we didn't even get the chance to order dinner because the second our friend walked in, the entire staff began to discriminate against him because of his slow rate of speech, which is a speaking quality that all of our friends know to be characteristic of our friend regardless of whether he has consumed any alcohol or not. Before our friend even got a chance to place an order, the waitress came over and told him her manager said that he could not be served alcohol. We were all speechless, we had a group of 7 coming for a special occasion dinner to celebrate friends moving abroad and another friend's new job. We were planning to order entrees and stay for a good hour or two, at least, celebrating. We asked if there was any reason for this, and the waitress told us first that it was her boss' decision and she was just following protocol, and then we asked her again and she confessed that she had just lied to us and that it was based on her own discriminatory judgments based on the way our only non-white friend looked and spoke. We had barely finished our appetizers and still had some wine to finish, so we asked for more bread to finish the dips/burrata that we had been allowed to purchase and were ignored for half an hour until they realized we would not be leaving without finishing the food we had paid for, and finally brought us bread. I don't know why this waitress chose to be so discriminatory to our friend with absolutely no basis, for his own celebratory dinner, but we will definitely not be back.",

This place is slightly above average, a little pricey for just ok food. The drinks were good and desserts were delicious. The truffle parmesan fries were McDonald's quality fries out of a bag (I chuckled a little when they brought it out). The pizza was not great, picked up a slice and all off the toppings slid right off into a puddle of grease. Ambiance is quite nice, outdoor seating is great. Service was ok, nothing special.",

I ordered Veal Marsala and a Manhattan. The veal wasn't warm, and it didn't taste good. Manhattan was stronger than it should be and it had crushed ice so my drink was all water in 5 minutes. My friend ordered some chicken and it was half cooked, not very pleasant. Their steak is good but it needs to be presented in a better way with real French fries. And their pesto pasta was great too.",

At first we thought the food was simply bland, but eventually realized that we all actually feel nauseous. I ordered the filet mignon Benedict, and my partner ordered the breakfast sliders. I sent back my steak because it was undercooked, and that's NEVER my complaint. I LOVE a good, medium rare piece of beef, but something was off. It was chewy and gamey, and I thought it had been undercooked. When I got It the second time, I realized that the flavor was that of old meat. My partner's sliders were comparable to fast food burgers.  Granted, this is an Italian restaurant, but their brunch offerings are what they are, and if there had been better options, we would have ordered them. As a restaurant, if you're going to offer a dish, it should be edible. Or at least not rotten. I will absolutely never go here again. If you choose to, I would avoid the steak, burgers, Bloody Mary, and brunch flatbread. However, I would recommend that you go somewhere else entirely.  Ugh. We both feel sick.",

I was nervous that we might not have been able to be accommodated because we did not call ahead, this was not the case. Our waiter was phenomenal! He indicated the gluten free and vegetarian labeling in the menu,  but when we proceeded to discuss our dietary restrictions, he told us that he would personally check with the chef about our choices. I made sure he was sure to explain that my food could not come into anything that had wheat or had touched wheat and again,  he took this back to the chef. I asked if the Tonno Sicilia could be made GF (as it was not labeled gf). Although he was very young,  he pointed out that I may encounter a problem with the pine nuts,  but was sure the chef would be able to adapt the meal to fit my needs. He checked with the chef and the pine nuts were left out and my meal was prepared in a separate area of the kitchen. It was delicious!!! My friend ordered a pasta dish and requested fresh seasonal veggies and they happily accommodated her wishes.  Since we had such great luck with our entr\u00e9es we decided to take a chance on dessert. I knew this would be a gamble but our waiter checked with the chef about what I was able to eat without getting sick. He said the only 100% GF dessert option was a cold berry soup with fresh berries inside,  topped with vanilla bean ice cream and crush amaretto cookies. The waiter said the chef hand made the dessert himself and developed the recipe. He put the ice cream on the side (stating that although it should be GF, they used a creamery and could not contact anyone to verify due to late hour). He also left the cookie crumble off. The dessert was amazing and so flavorful for being so light.  I did not get sick, was treated very well and had a phenomenal meal and experience. I would recommend this to any DC foodie or anyone that is unable to digest gluten. I cannot wait to return!",

He made an excellent wine pairing, even bringing us two samples so that we could choose our favorite. The food was so good!--mozzarella cheese, fresh bread, salad, pasta, seafood, eggplant, and the best tiramisu I have ever tasted! The atmosphere inside is just right to be intimate, yet still relaxed. I would definitely like to come back to Sette in the future. Thanks for a great evening!",

Then when asking about the happy hour specials he said yes it's happy hour in the same smart tone and walked away without answering our questions. I won't be coming back as long as he works here which based on his attitude probably won't be long.",

I decided on Sette Osteria based on the fact there was outdoor seating available when other restaurants did not.  That should have been the first clue in hindsight. They did bring out some really good bread to start out. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and it was huge and looked wonderful. There was a hair in the sauce but that isn't a huge deal to me. The taste was good as well until I cut into the thicker part of the chicken and found that it wasn't cooked. The inside of the chicken was raw. Needless to say I stopped eating and wondered what I had ate up to that point. They did comp the raw chicken meal but it still left us with a bill of $45 for one entree and one carafe of wine. I'll remember this sick feeling when I see an open patio table along a street with busy restaurants.",
