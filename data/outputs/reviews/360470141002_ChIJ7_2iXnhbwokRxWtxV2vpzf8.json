We went with pumpkin soup (fantastic!), chickpea bake, veg roti, saltfish cook up and sides of rice and peas and fried plantains. There are four of us (2 adults/6 yo, 11 yo) and we were stuffed! Portions were all decent and prices were reasonable. We vacation in the Caribbean once a year and Stella\u2019s is totally authentic. A taste of the islands right here in Brooklyn!  I toured the space briefly when I picked up my order, and loved it! Long and narrow with exposed brick and vivid colors, uptempo music, modern and cheery vibe, great tented garden space out back with a half dozen picnic tables painted light blue. Oh, and the staff? Super friendly. Dwayne treated me like a regular even though it was my first time there and I was only doing takeout! I will definitely be back, with the family next time, to dine in! What a great addition to the neighborhood!",

Filled with murals, lights and colorful flags.  Shemmel, our sever, recommended us to try the oxtail and jerk chicken -the two most popular dishes.  The chicken IS probably the best jerk chicken in Brooklyn. The sauce is spicy, flavorful, and carries weight to the dish. It tastes exactly how jerk is supposed to be -all soul, all flavor, not holding back on the spices that make it unique and special. The oxtail is tender and has great flavor as well. Even the side of rice and beans has a very unique, home-feeling flavor to them.  We had a very lovely dinner here and encourage everybody to dine here and support an amazing local business!",

We\u2019re vegetarian, so we tried the Pumpkin corn soup, and the vegetable roti, and now we can\u2019t wait to go back again. We met the owners Duane and Vera, and quickly understood that the magic in their food is reflected in their likeable and authentic personalities.",

The sauce is well balanced with garlic, hint of scotch bonnet (Maybe?), herbs and magic(definitely)! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. Service is super friendly and warm. A really wonderful addition to the neighborhood.",
