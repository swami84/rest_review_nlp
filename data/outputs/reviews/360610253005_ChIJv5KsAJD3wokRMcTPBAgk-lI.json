This place is not the same I have had bad experiences after ordering for a while.  1) I ordered a portion of red beans and the only thing I got was more water and not beans at all.  2) I decided to give it another chance and after I ordered I discovered they charge me twice and it took more than 2 weeks to get my money back.  3) Last chance I ordered a combo #1 and I found a rock inside the chicken and I almost broke my tooth.

Their offer was for me to walk/drive over to the resturant and pick up the missing dish myself, because in their point of view, \"the delivery person probably lost it\", so what can they do. I told them I don't have the time that day, but can come by the next day.  The next day, I called ahead 45 minutes beforehand, and when I arrived there, the peppersteak wasn't ready. They actually did not even start cooking my dish. The manager or whomever gave me the excuse it was because he did not want the food to spoil (delivery can take up to an hour, so I really don't believe that excuse at all). As I did not have another 20 minutes to waste standing there, I left and took the loss. Everyone was well-mannered, but the experience as a whole was rather dissapointing.",

I was expecting everything on one plate and yet I received two plates; one for the steak and some side salad, and the rice and beans on another plate. The food's taste and amount sure do deserve the price they have. My friend even gave me a piece of the grilled steak he ordered and it left me wanting for more. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the side salad was dry and there was no dressing with it. Furthermore, the lettuce was served in large amounts and there was a part that tasted like dirt so I had to skip on the lettuce altogether.  Other than that, I recommend this place!",

Basically Malec\u00f3n with the addition of ropa  vieja. They didn\u2019t have Media noche bread which to a Cuban like me is sacrilegious. I will def give it another chance and hopefully the mojitos will be more natural tasting. Some sort of flavored syrup gave it a cough syrup aftertaste. Great music!",

The chicken with the mofongo was excellent . The bad they have lunch portions for 10 dollars we were not given that menu. If you order in the front make sure to ask for lunch menu. We we charged for an avocado salad and didn't receive it.. the place needs organization. It was like a band without a conducter. Potential for 5 star is there.",

Which I think it\u2019s nice... many restaurants have their bars up front and it\u2019s hard to even get in.  The food here is delicious. My colleagues ordered shredded steak which I tasted and was well seasoned and tasty.  I had the sea bass and was pleasantly surprised on how  fresh it was.  The lunch specials are only $10 and the portions  are substantial.  Definitely a place to visit often.  If you find review helpful, click like.",
