The bowl of Pho was stale and had no taste of cultural authenticity. The baguette was overpriced and as Americanized as the cashier lady who can't even speak a word of Vietnamese. The coffee comes in a can and tasted like water saturated with milk and sugar. The stall is located in a quaint little French plaza, redeeming itself with an additional star for atmospheric depiction of Vietnamese colonial history.",

Over the last 2 years I had a chance to try out 6 different spots and found that Saigon Sisters was right by where I work.  I've loved all of them but having some of the best sandwiches with spice almost across the street from where I work? How could you go wrong?  You can't. I guess if there is any going wrong is that I've spent far too much money here over the last year and will continue to do so as each bite is full of flavor that just never gets old with a huge variety of sandwiches to choose from in case you ever did get sick of one!
