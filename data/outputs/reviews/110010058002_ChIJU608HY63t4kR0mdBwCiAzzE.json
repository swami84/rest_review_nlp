As an American-born Chinese and having eaten at dozens of Pan-Asian restaurants (including Asian fusion, Asian buffets and sushi buffets), this one is far below subpar. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and pad thai. Both had a pungent smell to the dishes - not sure what exactly. They tasted very different from all of the sweet and sour chicken and pad thai dishes I've had. Nonetheless my partner and I were disappointed. We asked for the sweet and sour chicken dish to be taken away, and ordered seven chicken wings instead. The wings were bland. Also was charged $13 for the sweet & sour chicken instead of the $8 wings - had to inform them about it and was changed immediately. It is very ironic for an Asian restaurant in Chinatown of D.C. to be lacking quality. The redeeming food was the side of jasmine rice.",

The only reason why I didn't give one star in this update is because the other recent reviewers seemed to have had good experiences. I'm going to believe this was just a bad day for them. I did, however remove a star.  This is what happened:  \u2714\ufe0f We went to one of my favorite Thai restaurants for dinner, Thai Chili, but the girl became angry because we wanted to sit and angrier when we asked to sit in a booth. Mind you, we were the only ones in the place ... not one other person. It felt weird like things had changed. It was dirty, service was awful and I was afraid the girl would turn into Celie from the \"Color Purple\" and have her way with my water, so we decided to leave.  In 2014: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50  Five words on food: The Best Coconut Shrimp Ever!  One word on service: Excellent! I love this place.",

Service is good and the servers are friendly! The place is ran by a Brother and Sister who also own Sushi Go Round right next to Thai Chili so if your feeling Sushi too ask them for the menu to Sushi go round.  You can order it at the Thai Chili restaurant and they will bring it to you!  Hope your experience at Thai Chili  will be as wonderful as mine!",
