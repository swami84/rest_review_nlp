Restaurant is small on the inside with only about a dozen bar stools that are up against  a horseshoe-shape configured high-top table. The eating tables face the assembly line for the burgers and the fridge/food storage which might be unsightly for some people. There's also a utility sink in the dining area next to the soda machine. Kitchen is in a separate room.  Menu is simple with a handful of different burgers and sandwiches. I ordered the Wagyu burger and I would highly recommend it. Just make sure to grab plenty of napkins.  Great lunch spot for those liking a laid-back atmosphere.  Simple and fun atmosphere with a friendly staff. Just make sure to get there early if going for dinner since they close at 6.",

Everything we ordered was fresh, crisp and hot.  There are hommade desserts on custom tables. There are awesome comic book pictures all over and fan art.  There was never a wait when we went probably because not a lot of people know about it. This is definitely a place you need to go!",

Well I just left about 4 minutes ago and after having a Teri burger and a smore chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream, I'd have to say this restaurant was the highlight of my trip. From the service to the food the only word I'd like to use is perfect. The perfect end to my vacation. If you're in the area and want a burger, going anywhere else is treason, and even if you're not in the area, it's worth the flight. Just use your frequent flyer miles because it's worth the trip. For the TLDR; Staff is like family and treats you accordingly. The burger is made right in front of you (with care) and is the best I've had so far. I don't what else to say, go here and enjoy it!",

You order first and then sit for your order at a counter or just wait to grab and go. Very creative flavors and combinations that work! Looking for a pick up for ono kine grindz,  give them a ring for your next order! Parking is in the back. It's on the corner across from gas station which is on the other corner.

We saw a couple of people come in a back door... there might be secret squirrel parking. I love this place for the service, personalities, comic book vibes (I'm a huge geek). My mom and I went and both had the juicy burger.  In retrospect this next comment should be obvious after what I just said  but...  our burgers were good but so juicy our buns soaked thru so they became useless quickly.  We averaged one napkin per bite. At the halfway point the bun was useless. The buns job, besides keeping your hand off the burger patty, is to keep sauce and any add ons all rounded up together for optimal flavor per bite... serious job requiring a seriously well thought out bun.  I do think the bun is sadly unappreciated.  It is a common oversight tho. Mom and I enjoy pretending to be foodies rating burgers all over the island.  Moms opinion is this burger its good (she ate the whole thing, you can tell it was awful) but she rates Teddy's and our favorite Seven brothers burgers above this burger,  making this her third favorite on island.  I'm putting them tied with Teddy's, they would pull ahead if they shored up the bun, added just a sprinkle of salt and, even tho it's the juicy burger, perhaps a little less of the juice on the plate... or make it an option at least. There is the Judy and Judy review of burgers and things In spirit of our geeky lunch \"May the force be with you \" Also, check out the bin of toys by the door, Darth Talon was there!!

Not only is their food good, but they continually refine their food in an effort to better things. Example, they made a burger that had chili on top of it. Said chili contained kimchee to give it a bit of bite. While the burger was good, it wasn't great.  Fast forward several months and I come back to find out that it's become something truly special. I unreservedly crammed their delicious creation into my face and then put away a further side of their new and improved kimchee chili.  The staff care deeply about the food they serve, and it shows in the quality and diversity. Do yourself a favor and let them decide what to serve you. It's all good and they won't steer you wrong.  That being said, a little bit of the warm ambiance has faded with their last renovations, through it's more spacious and easier to find a seat.",
