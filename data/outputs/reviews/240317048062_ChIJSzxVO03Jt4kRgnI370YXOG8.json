The bar usually keeps a couple of local beers on tap, but nothing to go wild about if you're a beer person.

Also likely more burnt on rim due to thinness of pizza.  I would have preferred not eating pure carbon and some more red sauce than only in a few scattered places, but it was still good...though, nothing beats unmatched NJ/NY pizza.",

Pizza was awesome and well worth the price. We plan to head back on Monday for their pizza and salad special and then Wednesday for the pizza and  wing special. Probably not the same week, but maybe lol the cocktails were awesome. It didn't feel like we were at a chain. I didn't know it was a chain. Awesome food and ambiance.

Turns out, they hadn't even started my order and I was told it would be approximately 5 minutes.  That turned out to actually be 10 minutes.  When I got home and inspected my pizza, the crust was burnt to a crisp, black.  I realize these are unique times, but set expectations around pickup and wait times properly.

On the night of May 10th, 2020, well into the covid era and after Maryland officially reacted, the majority of the staff of this establishment was not wearing any form of face coverings.  The staff seen were three individuals making the pizzas (one of them was wearing a mask, the others not), and the front-store worker (female who was interacting with the customers, giving pizzas, etc, also not wearing a mask and seen to interact closely with those making pizzas when not up front waiting for customers).  I was not the only ones to be uncomfortable with this, as I saw a couple walk out with their pies looking back and commenting in disgust that the workers were not wearing protection.  Particularly since the well lit/illuminated restaurant is on a busy corner, with big windows - I'm sure we are not the only one that noticed.  While the back store workers pose less risk, the front store worker was in disregard of Maryland Order Number 20-04-15-01 Section II.a.v, as well as respect for the safety for customers and staff, and also common sense.  Said Order states: \"all Foodservice Establishments shall require staff who interact with customers (including, without limitation, delivery personnel) to wear, and those staff shall wear, Face Coverings while working.\"  Regardless of the food, I would not consider it wise to eat from this establishment until they conform with health orders, common sense, and a better safety culture - for their safety and particularly for the customers/public.",

Despite just having opened this location, the service was great with not only the server themselves being attentive, but several managers coming by (appreciate the coupon Jared, if you see this). The attention wasn't overbearing, rather it was all the more notable considering how packed the restaurant was.  We came for the pizza of course, which was great, with thin crispy crust having a charred taste that did justice to the restaurant's name and quality sauce (not too much) and cheese that completed each pie. Don't skip the meatballs however, as they may well have been the star of the show.  Recommended, we'll be back.",

Liked the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  The only bad thing I can say is the fact they had no sauces for wings (and my GF likes ranch with  her pizza).  But on the grand scheme of everything, having no sauces is not a big deal in comparison to how good the pizza was.",

The restaurant was not busy. tbe Pizza was not cooked as good as the other locations! We asked for wings without the Onions on top and of course they bring us wins with plenty of Onions!  They need to fix these basic issues they just opened at this terrible corner with no parking and are the fifth business to try at this corner. Hopefully they get it right. Otherwise I\u2019ll stick to MB down the block.  There a million pizza and wing places in the DMV you better get your ducks in a row. Because I tried you guys once and nothing calling me back to try you again.",

Brian, Sam, and Jasmine were working the very busy bar area, and they handled everything quickly and with a smile.  We were particularly impressed because restaurants usually have some issues to work out during a soft opening, but everything seemed to be going great.  We're excited to have Anthony's in the neighborhood and expect we'll be back frequently.",
