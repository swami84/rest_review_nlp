Looking around, a lot of people was getting Khao Soi which we did not order. Perhaps that was what this place is famous for  Service 4/5 Kitchen staff doubles as wait staff. One of the kitchen staff will pause preparing food and take your order at the counter so do expect a wait when its busy. Self service with everything including cleaning up after the meal. I think this may be due to covid. Otherwise, staff are friendly and everyone is wearing a mask  Ambiance 4/5 Super tiny shop. Like a bar sitting area by the window and another table on the other side. Tables outside but no enclosure.",

There was a sign in the window mocking me which clearly stated said \u201clunch special 12-4\u201d and it was 3:35.  Not sure if this is usual practice, but upon then checking the delivery sites they also said the store was closed which their hours on their site and google say different- open all day until 10pm.  There\u2019s really no excuse to not have the correct information displayed in your own store window.  It makes me not want to try their food in the future.

The boat noodles (whose existence on the menu is, according to my Southeast Asian friend, a marker of authenticity) were savory and loaded with delicious ingredients.  The duck curry was gorgeously rich and flavorful and nicely offset by the crunchy long beans.  The larb was fresh, tangy, minty, and spicy\u2014 everything you could have asked for in larb and more.  Thai iced tea is creamy and not too sweet and perfectly complements all the strong flavors of the food.  Definitely coming back for dinner and would also love to try their congee breakfast!",

Everything we ordered was extra good. Lots of flavor, fresh, and quality ingredients from what I could tell. We didn't order any particularly spicy items but the curry we had came with spicy oil that added a ton of depth of flavor and heat.  Looking forward to ordering again soon. Major plus, you can order directly from the restaurant if you want to avoid all the insane Caviar fees.",
