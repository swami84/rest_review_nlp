Reasons why you should avoid ordering from here: 1) Extremely stinky odor throughout the entire store 2) There was a piece of clipped finger nail in my rice. Words cannot describe how I felt after seeing the clipper finger nail in my food. 3) Very small portions: They gave me 1 wonton in a small order of wonton soup and did not put in a bag of crispy noodles. 4) Far more expensive than nearby Chinese places 5) It took them 1 hour to make a take-out order of pork fried rice and small wonton soup. ONE HOUR",
