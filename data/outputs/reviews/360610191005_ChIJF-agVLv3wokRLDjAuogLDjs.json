Braised beef are so tender, soups on point but not too salty. My only issue is the egg. Wish it wasn\u2019t smoked and more cooked, the smell just made me sick :( Will definitely order again without the egg though!!! Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d",

Noodles are bouncy, broth is tasty, meat so tender it was actually kinda hard to handle with chopsticks.  The eggs in the noodle soup tasted AMAZING!  The dumpling skin was a little thick but very tasty.  Staff was very nice, food came out quick, and the kitchen was wide open and very clean.  One of my new favorite places in NYC, just wish I\u2019d known about it sooner.  Definitely coming back to try other parts of the menu.  Can\u2019t wait until pandemic runs its course and I can come and sit down at this place, but so far their takeout game is on point.",

Once you eat at The Tang, you\u2019ll instinctively wander back whenever you need some good, quick food that\u2019s not too pricey. This is a Chinese noodle bar on the Upper West Side with a big selection of things like dan dan noodles, roasted bone marrow, fried beef buns. If you just want one thing, go for the signature beef noodle soup with chewy noodles, tender beef, and a smokey soft-boiled egg. There\u2019s a bar overlooking the kitchen where you can eat by yourself, and there are also a bunch of tables in the sleek space where you can grab a casual weeknight dinner with a friend.",

My mum is from Shanghai and I grew up with legit Chinese food. We had things like pig knuckles and ears, herbal chicken soup, and all sorts of delicious veggies. They have all of that here and they do it with care and creativity.  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for modern, refined, yet authentic Chinese food.  They even gave us a free hojicha (roasted tea) panacotta on our way out. So good!",

I got perfectly cooked, amazingly chewy noodles, but the components of the sauce were wrong. They tried to make it more hipster by using chopped pork belly, but the pieces were too big to eat with the noodles and I ended up with a pile of salty pork belly and the bottom of my bowl. Additionally, I ordered the pork belly buns and got a really nice crispy man tou with succulent pork belly inside, but the whole thing was drenched in Chipotle mayo. The Tang seems like it can't decide between being an authentic Chinese restaurant and a hipster Chinese inspired restaurant, and the combination is often confusing. Additionally, this restaurant is expensive for what it is, and there is better authentic Chinese food across the street. And, the chairs here don't have seat backs. It's like sitting on a stool with a butt imprint",

My suggestion to anyone is to run, away, far away from this place. It is a disaster, waste of your time and money. The marrow bone is fake and awful, the dish with oxtail is a joke... inedible.

It\u2019s not a large space but it is thoughtfully laid out.  I love the bar area in front overlooking Amsterdam Ave.  And the hand painted wall murals are beautiful.  Almost every angle of this restaurant is Instagram worthy.  Does the food live up to the d\u00e9cor?  YES!  So happy we got to come for a food tasting.  We ordered quite a lot of food (for two people) when we were here. We ordered the fried pork buns, roasted eggplants, scallion oil noodles, pineapple fried rice with shrimp and the veggie summer roll.  The fried pork buns were amazing.  The braised pork belly melts in your mouth.  This was by far my favorite dish of the night.  The roasted eggplants were another great dish.  The soybean paste and bonito flakes really helped to elevated the eggplants.  The pineapple fried rice was great and I loved the shredded pork garnish.  The scallion oil noodles had great flavor.  The dish was smaller than I was expecting but the noodles were wonderful.  Cooked right and not overdone.  The summer roll was okay.  We ordered it because it looked like it was a new addition to the menu.  I think this dish was overshadowed by the fried buns and roasted eggplants.  We also ordered desserts and got the fried buns with condensed milk and a scoop of the lychee ice cream.  The lychee ice cream was surprisingly forgettable, but the fried buns were a winner.  It had a thin coating of caramelized sugar and had a nice crunch as you bit into it.  It did not need the condensed milk dip, in my opinion.  I definitely want to go back and try more of their menu. Or possibly just order 10 plates of the fried pork buns\u2014they were the bomb.",

If you can\u2019t properly allocate the overhead within the inflated price structure...shame. The food has somehow loss something traveling to this location. Maybe catered towards non-asian palates. The staff are friendly enough but should something be amiss, the staff will be less than accommodating. Cheap ingredients selling at premium prices. Tang is trying its best to be trendy like the lamb noodle place nearby.

The pork belly is big but with large amount of fat also without too much flavor so it is very greasy.  The noodle is not stirred well so some part is very salty while others are lack of flavor. The size of the dish is very pricey compare to its size. Cost $14 plus tax but it is a very small bowl. You might get hungry if you just order one bowl.  This locations is decorated well and the waitresses is friendly. If you sit on the bar you can see chief cook in front of you. But I do see flys on the counter. So this place may be not that hygiene on the back. Overall, not recommended.",

They just had to make small, low seats that are made only for small legs. But the booths look good. Sit on the booths if you come. The atmosphere here is lovely. There is not too much lighting, but there is enough of it. The music is not loud, but not quiet (and they play ok music.) It was not too loud when I went there, and I went there when it just opened. The service was very good. The people that worked there were friendly. The food was the best part of this place. I highly recommend trying the steamed pork dumplings. They were not that spicy and they tasted as dumplings should taste like. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup. That was good as well. The soup was tasty and spicy, and the noodles were thick. The scallion pancakes were good. They were warm and straight out of the oven. But they could have been thicker.",
