Perhaps it's a result of the shots and drinks the staff enjoy throughout the night that impairs them to the point that they are unaware of your presence.  Or perhaps it's the complacency that seems to have settled upon them.  The bar staff is on point.  They make great drinks and are very engaged.  The problem is the food and the leadership.  It is clear that if you are dining, you are a far second to the fun the staff wants to have!  Do yourself a favor and walk 15 yards to Citizen Soul.  You will be well taken care of!  The two stars is solely reflective of the cocktails and the bar staff.  Otherwise I would have given Holmes a 1 star or lower,",

Normally, I\u2019d understand that those empty tables likely belonged to other reservations, however, this wasn\u2019t the case given we were advised they didn\u2019t accept reservations for outside. When finally sat, it took another 20 minutes to get greeted from our server. Although the food was pretty good, the service was awful. There were 6 of us and our check came at the end and our server made us separate our own check with pen and paper. What a joke! There are far too many other quality restaurants in the neighborhood to return here. Huge disappointment.",

We got the short ribs as an appetizer which was so overcooked, tough & chewy that we had to ask for steak knives to cut it & eventually gave up & tried using our hands & teeth to gnaw it off the bone. More than half of the plate was the bone too & it was all really charred & not enjoyable at all.  We then decided to order the grilled sourdough with whipped ricotta because we\u2019ve had a similar appetizer at other restaurants & loved it & figured it would hold us over until the entrees came since the first appetizer was so bad. The bread was so terrible that we had to send it back (like we should have with the short rib). The bread was so charred that it tasted burnt (even the server said that\u2019s not the first complaint she\u2019s heard about it & she herself agrees!), it was served with a whipped ricotta with dill & chives - but so many that it was incredibly overpowering & we were practically chewing on herbs & aromatics... then beside that was a bunch of raw vegetables. Yes raw. Raw carrots, broccoli & cherry tomatoes that were all cold like they were just pulled from the fridge - zero flavor.  Then our entrees came. He got the Chicken sandwich & I got the salmon. The chicken sandwich came soaked in buffalo sauce & ranch & served on Texas toast & he said it was absolutely awful (I didn\u2019t want to try it). I got the salmon, which itself was delicious (my husband agreed) & cooked perfectly, but the glaze on top of it was so overpowering that it was hard to enjoy the salmon. It was served with a mixture of plain steamed shredded carrots, tiny broccoli pieces & cabbage.  Both of our stomachs have been hurting & upset ever since we left a few hours ago too. I was so bummed because it had good reviews online & it was one of the only remaining restaurants in the downtown Alpharetta area that we\u2019ve yet to try, but honestly we\u2019re sad we wasted $90 on this dinner for our first date night out without our baby since Covid. Such a disappointment but hopefully this saved you from a terrible experience as well!",

I just love the Weight of Sound drink.  I had a plate of crispy potatoes because I needed a snack. They lived up to the name. They arrived on a bed of aioli sauce, which goes so well with it. Enjoyed every bite of that.  Restaurant Holmes is one of my favorite restaurants in the Alpharetta City Center space. Looking forward to trying their full menu sometime.",

Ribeye with jalapeno aioli was deliciously savory, and who doesn't love a well seasoned waffle fry?! Duck with roasted root vegetables in creamy mashed potatoes and gravy was succulent and delectable. Desserts were a flawless finish. Apple toffee cake with homemade vanilla soft serve was guiltily sublime. The chocolate dome filled with black forest mousse atopped with raspberry drizzle was exquisite.

A separate dish, the fish sandwich, was actually served raw (not cooked in the middle at all). It was actually quite tasty once it had been sent back to the kitchen and cooked properly but ya know, food 101...  Nothing taken off our bill for the inconvenience. But really the manager should have come out and had a quiet word after the raw fish incident. So unfortunately a disappointing experience for us which is a shame as it\u2019s a nice place and like what they\u2019ve done with the old house.",

My son and daughter-in-law were flying back to Seattle later and both sides of the family decided to all have lunch together, 7 people in all.  The table we were seated at was al little cramped, but we had the room to ourselves so it wasn't loud. It seemed to take a long time to get service (my wife kept trying to wave someone down), eventually our daughter-in-law's mother got up and asked the fellow who seemed to be attending to the bar (he wasn't behind the bar, but it looked like he worked there) if we could get someone to take our orders.  After ordering, the food didn't take long to arrive, about normal wait time. It tasted good, it wasn't bad. But for the price, it seemed rather ordinary and small portioned.  I had the BLT. It was bood bread, toasted with a lot of butter/oil. There wasn't a terrific amount of bacon, lettuce, or tomato. But it did have enough sauce to soak through the thick bread and start to soften it. The sandwich was mostly bread and oil.  There were 7 of us for lunch. One of us ordered a beer. A few had some cold brew coffe. We each had a sandwich or salad. The bill came to about $155, with tip it totaled about $185.  Give the large number of really terrific resturants in the area, and for this price, we'll keep going to our regular places and try the occasional new places.",

The environment here is nice though, and based on reactions from a subset of our group, it helps with perception of the food.  About 70% of us thought it was overpriced and trying to be fancy but tasted meh, but the other 30% were swept into the appearance and atmosphere and thought the food was impressive.

The tapas style of service and the way the food is described on the menu can be a little overwhelming for some. I can promise order anything and you will not be disappointed. One of my current favorites are the carrots.",

If you are a \u201cpig out\u201d eater that likes to devour you food and go. This may not be your thing. Go read the one and two star reviews for this type. If you are sick of the same ole same ole. You MUST try Holmes. We were a party of four and ordered 8 small plates and 3 big plates to share so we could sample more. Everything was OUTSTANDING!!! Drinks too!!! We had them bring the food out slowly, one at a time. That way we could enjoy the conversation, drinks and sample the food slowly. We were there a little over two hours. It was as a blast!! You could close you eyes and just pick anything and it will be great!!!",

Second dish of salmon was barely lukewarm. Hmm. Third dish, steak: cooked to proper medium rare, but again the dish was only lukewarm.  Given the tapas concept of food brought sequentially as it's prepared I didnt anticipate a cold food scenario occurring.  The staff was excellent. The food was delicious - but cold. Dang.

Every time I\u2019ve been to Holmes whoever has taken care of us has explained that they serve SMALL plates that come out as they are ready. What the dishes may lack in size they make up for in flavor, and I\u2019ve never left unsatisfied with what I got for my money. I still have wet dreams about the charred octopus and the butternut squash ravioli. In addition to the kitchen being on point, the bar program is one of, if not THE most innovative in the area. I wish this place the absolute best of luck and can\u2019t wait to watch them grow and continue to crush expectations. Big thanks to the whole team!",

While the porch is awesome, I hope they will add shades as their Western exposure keeps the sun in your face and will make seeing that fancy pop-up TV difficult for afternoon games.",

Would recommend  First the bad part: We went for lunch in a large group with a reservation and they struggled to get our food out to us in a timeley manner(45ish minutes).  Even then when it did come out some people's food came out a good 10-15 minutes before others did.  Good part: Credit where credit is due, they did a great job making sure we were taken care of in the meantime and also did a great job communicating with us about the hold up.  At the end of it they very generously insisted on comping the meal for our party since things hadn't gone to the manager's satisfaction. I did not talk to the manager directly, but was told by those who did talk to him/her that they were very pleasant and handled things excellently.  The Food: The food was pretty good and most people in our group really liked what they had. I can only speak for the Fried Chicken Sandwich and fries. It was certainly a pretty good meal, but if you're going for lunch expect to spend $20+ for an entree and side.  Not a problem for all, but in the realm of lunch meals it felt a bit expensive for what it was.  Atmosphere:  The atmosphere inside was really nice, it's in a renovated old house that they have done a very good job with.  The outside seating area also looked like a very nice place to sit and enjoy the small plates and wine they serve at dinner.  Overall Holmes was a good place to eat and while I would recommend that people try it I will only be going back very occasionally.",

There wasn\u2019t one of all six that was not overpowered with flavor. The starch to protein to flavor ratio was well off. This is constructive criticism that should be taken professionally. From one business owner to another, the concept is beautiful but almost all of the food was over powered with too much flavor to the point of it being un enjoyable.

The portions were microscopic (what can only be described as a couple of bites per each dish).  2 drinks and 4 dishes added up to a $79 (before tip) tab.  I should have known when, while waiting for our food to arrive, I asked the couple seated next to us \"how is it\"' and they replied tentatively \"uh, it's interesting\".  There are so many restaurants in this neighborhood to choose from.  I'd say, do yourself a favor and skip this place. We even tried to alert the restaurant of their mistakes, as we sent their carrot dish back telling the waitress that the carrots were inedible.  They were an overcooked amazingly over seasoned/salty mess. They brought us a replacement within a minute, with what tasted like the exact same carrots we had just asked to have redone.  We did this because even though the 2 other dishes we received were oversalted, they were at least \"edible\".  The carrots were the last straw.  We left hungry and perturbed by our experience.",
