On the plus side: it's spacious, there's a pool table, and there's a nice atmosphere and decent beer selection.",

They have a selection of sake based variants of classic cocktails that all look really interesting. I'd definitely return just to check those out. They also serve sake from a very local sake vendor that produces really high quality sake. Looking forward to returning again sometime.",

I only wish that they had more food options because it\u2019s such a great place to hang out and I know people will get hungry after staying here for a few hours although there are a lot of restaurants in the neighborhood, including the famous pizza joint Roberta\u2019s. To their credit though they do pop-up food events such as the one that they recently had with sushi chef Chikara Sono, who used to head the Michelin star restaurant Autre Kyoya in East Village.  Everyone here is really friendly and they even have a cute puppy. I can\u2019t wait to see how this place evolves because it\u2019s such a great space!",

I'm not the biggest fan of beer, but it has amazing beer choices which seem to be brought in from New York, which is cool because I remember traveling around and always looking for bars that have local drinks to try. I am much more of a cider drinker, and they have an excellent cider on tap, I don't remember what it's called but it's super crisp, appley, and refreshing. The indoor space looks amazing, very roomy and atmospheric, with some lounge games like pool and shuffleboard, but I haven't had a chance to enjoy it due to the current COVID laws. But that doesn't matter so much because they have a huge outdoor space to hang out, and I love it because it almost feels like your in the backyard at a friend's house party, it's really intimate and low-key. Excellent for a group outing and especially for a date night",

A large open  industrial space (large is an understatement, they can accommodate a jumbo jet) surprisingly a very intimate vibe. The outdoor space is equally massive, a great quiet space easily supporting social distancing for multiple groups. The owners, Mika and John, are friendly, engaging, and their staff is a clear reflection of them. I had a few drinks, a local Sake, produced by Kato Sake Works, also in Bushwick. A clear effort of supporting the community. I had a few tastings, delicious and simple. I myself am a coffee guy, their coffee setup was impressive, I plan to return soon for coffee and pastries, followed by a few cocktails.",
