Also they took very long- around a half hour maybe more to get my order, which is not good for the quick to go place like this.  Carrot juice was good, it tasted fresh.

I ordered the okra gumbo in a to-go container and by the time I made it home, the rice container sitting on top of the gumbo container broke through the gumbo container plastic lid. This caused the gumbo to leak out into the plastic bag the container was in. It was a mess. Plastic shards from the gumbo container lid were soaked into the gumbo remaining in its styrofoam container. I painstakingly picked out the plastic pieces I could from the meal (probably didn't get all of them) and tried the gumbo. After all that, gumbo was mediocre, and needed more salt.  I encourage Meals From The Heart Cafe to reconsider their packaging so no one else has to go through this disappointing experience. In fact having compostable or recyclable packaging and limiting their use of single use plastics would make me more willing to give the place another try. It is important to me that the eating establishments I support are socially and environmentally responsible.",

It is at a very busy place, but they have an effective way of telling that your order is ready by SMS message, while you can easily explore the market. 30 min after our order, we got the message and, when we got there, unfortunately another family had mistakenly taken our food some minutes before we got there. Of course we were quite upset with this event, BUT the worker (I'm so sorry I didn't get his name :( ) was SO kind and he politely apologized for it , refunded our order (even though I insisted we were okay) , and he and the cook team worked on our \"re-order\" immediately. Long story short: we got our delicious meal 15 min after that, for free, and with an incredible experience of human kindness! Definitely recommend the place! Most importantly: food is delicious!",

It's a family owned restaurant where grandma's recipes are sure to please! Everything is homemade and made to order in the small on-site kitchen. Their specialties are crabcakes and plant-based meals with plenty of vegan and gluten-free options.  In addition to everything being so fresh and healthy - and homemade, we really appreciated that Meals From the Heart was able to accommodate everyone's dietary preferences and restrictions.  One had the vegan gumbo prepared gluten-free. Two split the crab cake po' boy because the portions are so generous. I had the crab cake tacos - also enough for two, but it was so good I devoured it all myself!  We highly recommend Meals From the Heart! Locals and tourists will both enjoy! #NuttieFoodie #EatMoreCrab  #vegan #vegetarian #pescetarian #paleo #keto #glutenfree #plantbased",

We spoke with the two waiters, who were relatives, who said that their grandmother is the major cook with the recipes whose goal from the gitgo was to provide healthy food and that she does. Low sodium, no pork, no transfat with veg and vegan food as well as carne dishes. Had the crab cake po boys, which took me back to my childhood eating at the kitchen table at my grandparents' home. So authentic, not that fake crab meat. Even had tiny bit of shell to prove its real crab. And the amount of crab was huge. Two people can share a PO boy. The vegan gluten free gumbo was divine too!!!And what I neglected to add was that their politics are spot on. The purpose of this joint is to provide healthy food to stop black people from dying of bad food. You just can't go wrong with this place. They may open a second location for the locals, so fingers crossed. Go there NOW!!",

So, they get a five, because I want to see them prosper. Most of you won't read the reviews any way. So, I have some notes for the owner -- 20-25 minutes to get ready is too long. It's too hot for all that. Figure out how to decrease your time. Perhaps reduce your menu. Figure out how to make it fresh and quick. Especially, since you only have 7 seats. Get them fed and on their way. You should be offering water to all who are ordering. You had 3 people working the front and it still took two minutes to get acknowledged after I picked up the menu myself and made a decision 3 minutes ago. So, it took five minutes to get acknowledged. I don't understand why you ran out of carrot juice so early in the day. But I guess that's also a good sign. I had the shake and it was delicious. I was expecting it to take more time, but the waitress said they just made a batch. I say you go all the way with the heart healthy and add earth healthy by using 100% paper cups and lids and utensils. Good luck and best wishes.",

In the midst of me waiting i watched 2 different groups of people sit, order, get their food, and leave. They ordered the same thing I did. When I brought this to the servers attention, she told.me the food is made from scratch and takes a long time. I've waited 20 minutes before and been happy to do it, but 45 minutes is ridiculous. The server had green hair and lipstick but I didnt get her name. She was VERY rude. I wont be back if I see her there.",

Seated in the heart of the French Market, this place needs a TRUE STOREFRONT... I'd be there weekly.  They have pressed juice. Pricing is great.  The food is made fresh and in-front your face (actually just behind a door) but you're able to see the cooks and there's nothing sketchy going on.  Converting to a non-meat eating & non-dairy eater is challenging and this place and a few others make it all the easier.  My only regret is that: I ATE IT ALL in ONE SETTING; it was soooooo delicious that I shamefully ate it all.  I wanted to save some for later, but it was just too good and I didn't have a full feeling, although I know you shouldn't eat until FULL, but hey I did it anyway... so I continued to eat until it was gone.  The staff was patient and kind.  I knew a few of them were in training, but the trainer was patient and pointed out obvious errors in a loving manner.  My food was prepared to my likening and in a swift, but in a knowingly FRESHLY PREPARED way.  Additionally, once i devoured all the food on my plate, I didn't have a full, stuffed, can't move feeling.  I was refreshed and still felt light and fluffy, which made walking back to my car all the easier.  Parking wasn't easy, but it was worth it!!!!!!",

The first time my husband had the famous vegan crab cake tacos, wow!! And I had the beyond Burger with the potatoes and it was amazing! On our second visit I had the vegan blueberry pancakes topped with more blueberries, strawberries and nuts. Omg They were the best I have ever had. Seriously I cannot say enough about them.

When we finally received our food, there was no cheese. When we told them this, they said that there was cheese, and we could not see it because it was melted. No one tasted any cheese because there was none. The food was good, but they lied about the wait and about the cheese. Never eating there again.",

The total came to $15.14. I thought that was a bit pricey for what I ordered,  but I hoped that the portions  would be decent and the quality would be worth the price. I  waited over 40 minutes  for my food after asking for ETA twice. The woman seated next to me (who was there before me) waited as long or longer for her tacos. When my food finally arrived, I was shocked at how small the portions were. The cheese grits were in a small styrofoam bowl and didn't taste or look like they had any vegan cheese at all.The slider was smaller than I expected and had a \"crab cake\"  that  was mushy and falling apart. I did eat the slider- which didn't taste bad-, but at a cost of  $8, I felt kinda ripped off.I spoke up about the grits to the young lady working in the front and her solution was that I pay for extra cheese. Before I could tell her that wasn't fair to me, the owner (I believe)intervened and gave me a refund. Again, I wanted to like this place, but the wait time, portions, price and quality would keep me from ever returning here.",

I had a little trouble finding it because it's not really a restaurant, but rather a bar-like counter in an open-air food court. Very limited seating. The place was very busy at lunch and the staff a bit overwhelmed. My dish was a mixed bag. The steamed veggies were clearly frozen veggies simply reheated without any seasoning, but the black bean sandwich was really delicious. The server was the highlight of the experience. Super-friendly and attentive. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a quick and healthy bite, but be aware that it's a tight and busy lunch counter and doesn't have much ambience.",

The server was not very helpful and wound up ringing my order in the way she felt necessary rather than listening and answering my questions.
