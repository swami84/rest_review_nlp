As it will always help the restaurant, we should order from the business using their own website.  The delivery experience was not as expected this time but I think they can improve in the future. I placed an order at 1:06pm and called at 1:57 to check, and they still don\u2019t have a delivery person available. Our food was ready when I called. Unfortunately the food arrived cold. The restaurant called after to check in and explained that was a staff mistake and offered refund. I appreciate their customer service. I wanted my husband to try this place but he had to leave for the airport. He ended up ordering from a taco place that comes quicker.  Since the weather is getting warmer now, I would go and get fresh food from Bricolage. If you have to order, still should use their website to help them avoid fees charged by the other platform.",

I\u2019m not even comparing it with what I\u2019ve had in Vietnam but to just a simple basic bowl of pho you can find in nyc. I ordered the pho bo, I appreciated the thickness and tenderness of the beef brisket and tripes were crunchy but they had no taste at all! The broth tasted like nothing to me. It was so bland! I wanted to ask for salt which I never thought I would have to for a bowl of pho. I couldn\u2019t finish the noodle because it was so bad so I asked for it to go (to not waste food and since I had to pay $18 for it).

We felt ok, despite this area being totally enclosed to keep heat in. I was surprised that they called it outdoors given the way it was enclosed in all areas. Shortly after, many other groups came in. They packed us in, my boyfriend was back to back with another table 2 feet away. We wore out masks for a few pets of the night until finally packing our food to go.  People\u2019s safely should be everyone\u2019s first priority. This place did not care about that. And if there is some sort of ventilation system that no one can see allowing that to be called safe, I\u2019d love to understand how.

The banh xeo exterior was crispy with a light brown crust, and it did not get soggy from the shrimp and bean sprouts interior. They did not skimp on the ingredients for this one.  Lastly, the house pickles were a good treat to have with these two dishes. I did not have the five spice fries, but could smell it from the table across from me and wished I had the stomach space for it!  In addition to the food, Bricolage has a charming backyard seating with vintage pieces for it's decor. The open kitchen lets you watch how these delicious bites are put together.
