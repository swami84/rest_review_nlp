I was then seated by the host quickly, and after he waited on me (unexpected but appreciated due to speed of service), he brought me a list of 8 local pubs/restaurants without prompting - excellent customer service! Very impressed - thanks John!  His recommendation of mint lamb chops were on point with flavor! I was very impressed to taste such a strong mint, which is exactly how I like my lamb - minty... but 3 of the lamb chops were a bit overcooked, while one of the four were undercooked. Minus one star from the inconsistency of cooking.  Their calamari was fairly well seasoned, but the best part was the shrimp and peppers - a lovely heat to them. The sauce is actually mustard base, which is an interesting flavor combination with the seafood. I wouldn't have done the cheese, and it was a bit greasy.. I approve though - kudos for trying something new!  Their wine list was just enough for me. I enjoyed it, great Cabernet. Overall, definitely would recommend this place and will try again.",
