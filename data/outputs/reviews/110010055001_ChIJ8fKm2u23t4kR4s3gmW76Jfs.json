The best thing they had going on a Saturday evening was indoor dining available for our party of 4 - especially without a reservation.  They weren\u2019t eager to have us, and/or they seemed genuinely surprised that anyone would show up with out a reservation?! (Our friend just moved in a block away and we thought we would try this restaurant as our new \u201clocal go-to.\u201d) They tripped all over themselves, literally 3 staff member fussing over our party of four, in the very small entryway, as another couple arrived (who had an rsvp)... each of the 3 staff asked me if we had an rsvp and how large our party was and if we were all there. It was just an odd \u201cwelcome.\u201d  I got the impression that they were actually hoping we would turn and walk out, but we didn\u2019t, so after about 4-5 minutes of this keystone cops welcoming dance, they managed to find us a table. It was a large table set for 6, just inside and up three steps - and in the breeze every time the front door opened. But hey, this is what we get without any reservation - that part of the evening is on me!  The bread was made in house (I think) and it was delicious!  We ordered a variety of items: steak tartar, pasta with duck, scallops and steak. I had the steak and it was very disappointing for $38 - nothing wrong, but it was oversold on the menu, as tri-tip and sirloin. It was about a 4 Oz cut of tri-tip and two small slices (maybe 2 Oz each) of beef loin. Nothing fancy, nothing special.  They had a great wine list and wines by the glass for $12-18. I had a nitro stout and it was delightful, despite the $9 price tag.  The dessert selections were good and the ladies enjoyed them.  The food was fine - a bit overpriced and the staff took themselves a bit too seriously - or perhaps I did, but I just never felt that we or our business was really welcome.  Lastly, the water in the restroom was so cold I couldn\u2019t wash  my hands... it was probably 35 degrees. Not good esp during covid.",

From what I remember we had: Skate wing and octopus with roasted tomatoes Cooked perfectly. Peach gazpacho with shrimp Very refreshing. Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi - Locally Foraged Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, Buffalo Milk Butter, Pecorino Cheese It was very light and pillowy. Roasted Shenandoah Lamb Loin -Red Kuri Squash braised with Saffron and Lamb Confit, Kale Buds Very mild and delicious dish specially the lamb confit.

We just did takeout and the pickup was smooth but, starting with peering into the bag and wondering why there was so little pasta in the top container, it went downhill. The bass crudo was excellent and only a tad on the small side for the $16 price. The two pastas were not listed on the menu as primo piatti; there was no indication of how small they would be or we wouldn't have ordered for $26 each. The sweet corn and pork belly ravioli, as the picture demonstrates, was a tiny portion - 5 2-bite ravioli and 3 measly slivers of pork belly, with nice flavor blown out by way too much salt. The lobster roe and egg pappardelle with a tiny amount of crab meat was small and confusing - the flavors didn't come together, especially the random size pieces of beans, which added a weird textural element. A squeeze of lemon from our fridge helped a little, but not enough - this dish needs to be rebuilt with more acid, possibly cherry tomatoes instead of beans. We failed to see evidence of James Beard caliber talent, and were left hungry and disappointed. With so many other fantastic Italian and new American places within half a mile (not to mention Persian, Korean,  etc), there are much better choices where your money will go farther for both quality and quantity. We tried to come up with a reason to go back, including the interesting restaurant week menu, and couldn't come up with anything compelling. Also, would recommend throwing in a piece of courtesy bread with takeout orders.",

        "caption": "First, I must say that we went on the third night Annabelle was open but must rate it off our experience.  The hostess was charming and accommodating to our walk in status and had a place for us at a table by the bar.  Where we were then forgotten.  The pleasant but not very helpful server was slow to take our drink order and then must have forgotten to submit our dinner order.  We both had salads to start, mine was very good, the other salad, Monte Cristo was not very exciting.  I then had the cod which was absolutely amazing and my dinner partner had the duck which was \u201cgood \u201c.  Problem is that no one explained about ordering sides so you don\u2019t go home hungry.  We waited about 1/2 hour or longer before someone offered bread when our server told the bread person we had already had bread.  The hostess did notice we had been waiting a long time for dinner and a manger did come to apologize.  We would have had dessert but felt we had been there forever by the time the dessert menu came.  Though I was pleased with the amazing cod, my dinner partner went home and ate a second dinner.  I do hope these wrinkles are ironed out as the space is beautiful and I am sure more good things to try on the menu.  We will go back and try again- in a while.",

        "caption": "First look:  Annabelle promises to be an exciting addition to the Kalorama and Dupont neighborhoods. Walk in the front door and be greeted by a gorgeous bar glowing in golden light. The space is cozy, but the ceilings appear taller than they are thanks to great lighting, beautiful bottle displays, and sculptures in the nooks and crannies. Up a small set of stairs are two main dining rooms, which we only saw briefly. Decorated in jewel tones, they seemed polished enough for a business meal, but comfortable enough for a gathering of friends. The place feels \"establishment\" without sacrificing style and character.  We enjoyed dinner from the more intimate garden room, a small space that was perhaps the least visually interesting but quite calming, especially with leafy vines descending from just below the glass ceiling. Over pauses in dinner conversations, you could hear other patrons talking about the neighborhood. It's clear that locals will enjoy having a place of their own.  But most importantly, the food was excellent! Highlights included gnocchi with blue cheese and pear, the duck and pork entrees, and the goat cheese cheesecake with fruity sorbet. The pork dish creatively combined both shoulder pot roast and loin portions, and the duck's crispy skin was delightful.  We appreciated the quiet but friendly service, which included a helpful recommendation from the head of the wine program.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Annabelle! We look forward to revisiting when we have a cause to celebrate, and in the meantime we eagerly await the release of the more casual bar menu.",
