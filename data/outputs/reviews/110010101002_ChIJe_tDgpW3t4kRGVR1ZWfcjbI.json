The wait time to order food was long as they were quite busy, we also had to wait almost 20 minutes to receive our rolls. We took our food to go, and were sad to find that what we got wasn't what we ordered. All three rolls we received had no Chicken Tika in them, instead grilled chicken with zero Indian spices in it. The closest to India that we got with the rolls was that they were wrapped with Naan bread. I was somewhat confused by how long it took to get our food based on what we got.  The redeeming qualities of the meal were the fries and the chutneys, especially the mango one. Generally speaking not a great first impression, and I likely won't be back anytime soon.",

Got the butter chicken, but it had no butter flavor. The sauce was very tomato heavy, and tasted more like it was made for Italian chicken parmesean. The chicken itself was a little dry and tough, not soft and melt-in-your-mouth like butter chicken is. Sag paneer was standard, no complaints. Got a cardamom chai latte that had no taste of cardamom and no sugar. No sugar in chai??? Are you insane? All the chaiwallas on any Indian train know you sweeten the heck out of chai! So I paid 3 bucks for bitter water.  The place is ok, but given the cost and gambles on flavors, I'm not sure I'll go back.",

Service was mediocre, just barely friendly but not rude. Now the food. And let me say I know good authentic Indian fare. I ordered their Butter chicken platter. Out came a cafeteria style tray with a plastic oval dish or chicken and rice. Not appealing but I thought taste would make up for it given the high reviews. NOPE. The chicken tasted tomatoey like a can of Marina sauce was used as the base.  It was bland. I could detect any hint of Garamond Masala, Turmeric or Cumin. I couldn't finish it. The chicken didn't have that tandori taste. The  naan was ok. The rice was plain. For almost $12, it was very disappointing.",

Would have liked more spice/flavor. The employee I dealt with was extremely nice.

Although I didn't love my meal, I will be coming back.",
