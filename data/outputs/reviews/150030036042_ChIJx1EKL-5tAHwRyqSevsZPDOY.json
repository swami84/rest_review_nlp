I was told they just got their new machines two days ago, which was a nice surprise because the reviews I read before coming over said the song selection wasn\u2019t good. Well, it is now! I\u2019ve been serious about karaoke for a long time and this placed is tied for best selection of the places I\u2019ve been on the mainland.  Employees were nice, room was nice, sound quality was pretty good but every now and then the speakers would do a weird crackly thing unrelated to the mic. It wasn\u2019t bothersome.  I paid $10 for the room, then $1 per song. They have an ATM and are happy to exchange your larger bills for $1s. There is a $20 minimum charge to use a credit card which I didn\u2019t expect, but it was no big deal thanks to the ATM. iirc the ATM fee is almost $4 but that\u2019s why I use Schwab for my bank; if your bank doesn\u2019t reimburse ATM fees, come prepared with cash.",

It took over 45 mins just to get a drink an hour just for some wings and sushi. While we waited we put our name on the waiting list for karaoke they said an hour fine no problem, hour rolls around and they gave our spot to someone else while we sitting right there. Fine they make up for it give us a bigger room. When it comes time to leave we ask for our cards back and no one can seem to locate our cards and it takes forever for them to bring them. When told they would comp wings for the troubles I said ok thanks. LIES, my husband never got his card back so he went back today to get it and they said we still owed for the food we were told was to be taken care of. When asked why, they said they didn\u2019t want to argue with drunk people so they told us whatever we needed to hear basically. Excuse them! I had two drinks and was very aware of my surroundings and something seems very sketch about this place, I will be checking my bank statements making sure they were not stealing card numbers. The owners son said he would ensure everything was taken care, very bad business DO NOT GO HERE! Bathrooms are gross and they replay the same songs back to back. Also you will have three waitress come check on you and no one will bring you your order \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude44",

I was there with some friends couple of nights ago and my friends and I needed drinks. 20 minutes went by until I decided to take our empties outside for another refill. Low and behold everyone one of them were either talking on their phone or sitting down and talking stories. Very bad customer service there.",
