Unlike before, customers can't walk up to the omelette/waffle bar-you have to order your omelette and waffle on an order sheet and give it to your server; smart!  The omelette was great! I was surprised that the waffle automatically came with chicken. They DID say chicken and waffles. Maybe I didn't read it right. Hey, I'm not about to complain about fried chicken.  Maybe I am because unfortunately the chicken was not well seasoned at all. I just moved it to the side and the waffle was tasty though. It makes the most sense to do the all-you-can-eat/bottomless option. We only ate one portion of each and were full, but it's worth it Bc it would've been more \u00c0 la carte.",

One major reason I\u2019m not leaving 5 stars: we did have a problem with management being a little sketchy/deceptive regarding happy hour wine. The menu lists that during happy hour, all house wine is $6/glass. We asked our waiter if they had any house ros\u00e9 and he responded yes, that they did have a house ros\u00e9. Great! We get our bill and they had charged us $13 for that glass of \u201chouse\u201d wine. We spoke to the waiter and manager, and apparently that wine wasn\u2019t included in the happy hour. This felt extremely deceptive: the menu states that all house wine is $6/glass during happy hour, and our waiter verbally confirmed that the wine we ordered was house wine. Yet they charged us more than double for that same glass! They took the price down to $10, but it still was almost double what we thought we\u2019d be paying. A really unfortunate resolution to an otherwise extremely pleasant dinner\u2014left us with uncertainty regarding a return visit.",

At Mazi, it\u2019s not obvious what their game is. After happy hour here, I can\u2019t find something that\u2019s worthy of 5 stars. Here\u2019s why:  1) Food: The happy hour menu is decent, but the food wasn\u2019t exceptional. My honey feta was good at first, but after 3-4 bites, it was all a little too much. My friend ordered the meatballs and found them dry and lacking flavor.  2) Drinks: Overpriced and mediocre. My margarita was $8 on happy hour prices and watered down. Every other sip, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was sipping water or alcohol. My friends were charged $13 for Baileys on the rocks (it should be $7-$9) and $12.50 for vodka and club soda. If it was the best in that city, maybe, but overpriced for meh drinks.  There were a few good points:  1) Space: It\u2019s not gorgeous, but the space layout and design are not bad. It\u2019s simple yet a little more elegant than the average restaurant.  2) Service: Our server was attentive, kind, and gave us her honest recommendations.  I will say we went at 4pm on a Wednesday for happy hour and we had the entire place to ourselves. We stayed 1.5 hours and no one else came in. Time will tell if they survive.",
