In person it's a hassle to send it back and  wait for the correction. When it is ordered to go it is even more disappointing.  The standard chicken sandwich comes with a spicy spread  I'm not a spicy person so I always ordered it without any toppings, including the sauce.  I love,love, love the sandwich this  way. But 50%-60% of the time I request what I want and I'm given the standard. Please try to get it right. Usually dont wrote reviews but I had a long day at work and was looking forward to the sandwich\ud83d\ude14",

We ordered the fries and were charged $4 (apparently because two of us were splitting a burger, so suddenly one order of fries cost $4). The server should have let us know we were going to be charged extra for an unremarkable burger that was already overpriced to begin with.

Not sure why they changed from a counter-order to \u201ctable service\u201d establishment. It was much faster to wait in their old line than to wait for the servers to notice you the way it\u2019s currently set up. Most of the time, there are no servers on the floor at all, and when there are, they ignore you. We got our own ketchup, etc. We waited so long for our check and then for our card to be picked up that we just took the card to the counter to pay. When we did, a server goes, \u201cCan I help you, bro?\u201d When my boyfriend explained that he wanted to pay, the server said \u201cok\u201d and walked away.  On a less important note, it doesn\u2019t make sense to take away all the menus after you order food, because it\u2019s a brew pub \u2014 it isn\u2019t as if anyone is coming there for the food. I ordered the JP burger medium-rare and got it on an untoasted bun and done medium-well. Maybe I had annoyed the server by asking for it medium-rare twice and she decided to take revenge. We used to come here often when it was counter service, but now sadly can\u2019t justify coming anymore.",

Ordered the collard melt which I thought was going to be a grilled cheese on sourdough with greens in it. What I got was an expensive and sad looking open face sandwich. It was a single piece of flabby, untoasted bread smothered in cheese sauce with bits of collard greens in it. Tasty enough but very unappealing to look at. Also it was served on parchment paper for some reason so when I used a knife and fork to eat it the parchment would tear and get stuck to the sandwich. I was pulling bits of paper out of my mouth on every bite. It was supposed to come with curry chips but I received a pile of plain potato chips that I'm pretty sure came out of a bag. It's laughable that it cost me 12 bucks. Life is too short to go back here again.",

        "caption": "I absolutely love the food and drinks at Jolly Pumpkin. We were so excited to have a brewery in Hyde Park. However, the service is some of the worst that I have ever experienced. The management and wait staff are clearly not trained for table service. I understand that there is to be a learning curve while switching from counter to full service, but the service has been going downhill steadily. I have had the occasional good waiter/waitress, but the horrible experiences outweigh the good ones.  I recently had a large group event (20 people) there. We called ahead and were even required to sign a contract. However, when we arrived just a few minutes early (if you aren't early, you are late), the hostess and manager were unsure where to sit us and had to split us up.  As people trickled into the event, not a single waiter/waitress approached our table until almost 45 minutes after our reservation. We had to find the manager and ask for a waiter. Then it took another 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive. We made sure to order our entrees when our waiter dropped off our drinks. We flagged our waiter down to put in another order for drinks, flagged him down 30 minutes later to check on those drinks, and then received those drinks another 15 minutes later.  We received the bill from the second table of our group, and then we had to ask that waitress to hunt our waiter down to get our check. We could have easily left without paying, but we would have felt horrible regardless of the poor service.  In summary, the food is great, but the service should either return to counter service or be completely revamped. The horrendous service also appears to stem from the poor management.",

We went here with a large party, for which we had called ahead four days in advance so that they knew we would be coming and could accommodate us. As it was a rather large party, we signed a contract with them for guaranteed gratuity, etc well in advance. Me and one of the other guest arrived 10 min early, so we spoke with the hostess and she seemed confused for our large party. Her and the manager then had to figure out how to even seat us because they had not already set aside the tables, which we thought would be done based on our communication with them days earlier.  We are finally seated as more of our party shows up. No server comes over to greet us, take a drink order, nothing. We have now been sitting there for 20 minutes. I had to flag down a waiter who when I asked if we could place a drink order as we had been waiting and no one had come over yet, responded just \"uh sure\" and walked away. 10 more minutes passed and another member of our party had to flag down the manager who then said he had to tell the waiters it was okay to serve us. I have never heard of a scenario where a manager has to give a server an \"okay\" to serve a party that made a reservation?! 10 more minutes later and we can finally place a drink and appetizer order.  40 minutes after sitting down we finally had water pitchers brought to our table.  Appetizers come out timely but it is about 30-40 minutes after placing our drink order (over an hour after we had been seated!) that most of our table received their drinks. There was a mix up with my drink apparently, because I did not receive it. but no server communicated this with me.  10 minutes later I flag down the hostess as she is the only one walking any where near our table and ask if she can check on my drink as i ordered it AN HOUR AGO. She says sure, she'll talk to someone. She then proceeds to just continue back to the hostess stand and I never once see her talk to a waiter or bartender about getting my drink sorted.  An hour and 15 minutes after we were seated, we can finally flag down our waiter to place a food order. I ask him about my drink. He tells me there was a mix up and the bartender is working on it. It is another 15 minutes before I even get my drink. At this point we had been there an hour and a half.  After my drink, I left frustrated while the rest of my party ate dinner (which did not come out before two hours after we were seated).  This was the most disappointing and terrible service I have ever had in my life. This place has great food and drinks, but the service and treatment of customers here makes me not want to give them my business.",

As soon as I opened the door, someone wearing a \u201csecurity\u201d uniform barked at me \u201cCan I help you?\u201d while putting up an arm to block my entrance. Not being accustomed to seeing or being stopped by security in restaurants, I thought maybe there was some emergency taking place and I was being barred and asked for safety reasons. A quick look around showed that this wasn\u2019t the case, so I asked the guy if there was a problem and was I not allowed to come in. Instead of answering my question, he shouted something at the two people standing at the host podium. I couldn\u2019t hear their exchange but the \u201csecurity\u201d later turned back to me and again shouted at me \u201care you ordering something?\u201d To which I responded with something close to \u201cwhat the hell do you think I\u2019m here for?\u201d I then proceeded to the hosts and asked one of them if the \u201csecurity\u201d was in their employment (or that of the event taking place outside). The host stated that he was their employee. I then explained to the host that because of how he believes people should be greeted when entering a restaurant that they had just lost my business as well as my friends that were to join me. The host gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and sighed before apologizing through his teeth, so it seemed very insincere. And he made no move to talk to the \u201csecurity\u201d about his behavior. Regardless of whether or not he meant it, it was far too late anyway as I was no longer interested in spending any of my money there.  The proprietors seriously need to retrain their staff - customer service starts at the door. That and/or change the name from \u201cJolly\u201d.",

I went two more times since the change, and never went back afterwards. Also, last few times it seemed they only had IPAs and Sours; all the beers I wanted were out. I ended up ordering wine (in a brewery). Food is still delicious and the place is nice, but I used to go for the bar and chill vibe, not the restaurant.",

Lots of tables for large or small groups, the service was slow as they have recently switched to a server based system.  Our server, at least, was slow and was pretty nonchalant about it.  When patrons are ordering 2 beers at a time or when they only have 1/2 a beer, it should tell you something.  But, overall it was a 3.5 to 4.0 on the scale given the slow service.",

It took 20 minutes in this quiet half-empty restaurant for the 3 of us to be greeted and then led to a table. The hostess was disengaged and unmotivated.  When sat, all the staff was sauntering around like tired turtles; the vibe was pretty bad. There are several TVs but the only one playing sound was overly loud and tuned to a news broadcast in Spanish. A lot of tables looked stagnant, waiting for something; no one smiling. It all felt \u2018off\u2019 and nothing we expected from Jolly Pumpkin. Not sure if the B Crew is on staff on Sunday\u2019s but it looked like no one was running the show.  After 5 minutes of waiting at our table we felt uncomfortable, cut our loses and left, which really stinks because we drove far to take my husband here for a special lunch.",

Last night we ordered a thing of truffle fries with all our beers as we always do. They brought out what tasted like normal fries (we think they forgot the truffle oil). No big deal, no one\u2019s fault, there was just a mistake. My friend tells the waiter. The waiter was great about it and said we could keep the other fries, and he\u2019d bring out a new order of the fries with the truffle oil. A few minutes later he comes back and says the manager said if we wanted more we\u2019d have to buy more. The waiter looked nervous, so my friend told him not to worry about it. I overheard and didn\u2019t think this was right, as the manager\u2019s solution was that we (a group of 6-8 customers who come for trivia every week) pay the full price for truffle fries when we received regular French fries. I went up to the bar to talk to the manager hoping she would at least take a few bucks off because on principle that is just not right. The manager was incredibly rude, interrupted me multiple times as I tried to explain her my request, was very sassy and unprofessional, and worst of all SHE CALLED ME HONEY. In the end she agreed to give my friend a free thing of fries, but her attitude towards her customers was completely unreasonable. This bar/restaurant is going completely downhill, starting with hiring a manager with the worst people skills I have ever seen.",

My only complaint was that there weren't that many different types of brews just a lot of variations of the same brews. So if you are someone who likes fruity brews, there are a TON of options. If you are someone who likes pale ales, there are a lot of options. Someone who likes hoppy brews has a few choices. But if you want something truly \"different,\" experimental, or a coffee brew like I love (which I've seen at a lot of other breweries in the city) there isn't any/much so I'd suggest somewhere else.  On an eco-friendly note, I'd knock off half a star if I could. They gave us plastic straws right away for our waters which I didn't like, but we just didn't touch them. At the end I was happy to see their take out box seemed to be eco-friendly and biodegradable. HOWEVER, it was so flimsy that if you held half of the box it started to bend in half and fold in on itself. It didn't even make it through the Uber home and I had it in an empty reusable bag. Felt like they were only half trying to be eco-friendly and their attempt (the box) was a giant flop....literally.",

If you don\u2019t know their beers, they\u2019re funky, they\u2019re sour, their creative. But don\u2019t worry... if that\u2019s not your thing, they have North Peak beers with your pale ales, IPAs, stouts, etc.  I love having these world class beers in Hyde Park. Prices are good ($6-$8) and the staff is friendly. The food is upscale pub food. Some find it a little pricey. I agree. It\u2019s on the expensive side, but the pizzas and sandwiches I\u2019ve had a good. I\u2019m more likely to come for the drinks than the food. The biggest downside is the service situation - you gotta order at the register (unless you\u2019re sitting at the bar). Inconvenient at times? Sure. But the line usually moves quick and it\u2019s only a mild inconvenience. And I\u2019ll stand in line any day to have access 10-12 Jolly Pumpkin beers (seasonal and rotating taps all year long) on tap any day. And you can buy bottles to go \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc  EDIT: Went 2/2/19 and they now have table service. A welcomed change. And they have a whole new food menu.",
