I was waiting for one of my daughters who was having her hair done next door at Hairspace (amazing salon btw).  I came over  hungry hoping to try another restaurant in the area but, opted to order here instead. Everything was delicious. Ordered Chicken parm pizza, a steak & cheese sub, fries, and ziti with alfredo. My family is very fussy .  Wheb my husband says pizza is \"amazing\" he is not kidding. Copious dollops of creamy ricotta, tasty sauce and plenty of chicken. So good! My daughter who doesn't eat meat (and doesn't like much of anything) thought the alfredo sauce was delicious.  Rich and buttery...definitely honemade. I got the sub. Actually tasted like steak! Very flavorful,  not one bit dry and crumbly. We were all  pleasantly surprised and will be making the trip from Arlington again.",

Usually, when im ordering, I ask for a large buffalo chicken pizza with barbecue wings. They never fail to provide me with some amazing quality food. The price is also pretty fair and the food is definitely worth the money. I would definitely recommend people to pay a visit and order at wellingtons.  Additionally, I was recommended to try the Brazilian Burger and not exaggerating when I say this... this burger was the best burger I have ever had! It comes with ham, egg, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and so many more ingredients. I was so surprised when i first got it. It\u2019s so big and it comes with a side of fries. I loved it!  Thank you Wellingtons for your service!",

The place was dead empty so idk how they could forget we asked for to go. They run the place like it\u2019s a social club and not a food eatery as they seem to have not only staff but also friends behind the counter. All and all they seem to treat their customers more so as a burden than anything else which explains why they seem to be a ghost town. It made me ask myself \u201cis this their place of work or is this their living room\u201d and it was not in a comforting way. The mac and cheese was lousy only came with one piece of chicken tender and the crab cakes were nothing special also burnt at the bottom. Counter lady was very dismissive and ignored us for a bit; maybe get a kinder person to be the face of the store? Very unlikely I will return or recommend this place to anyone.",

When it arrived, I opened the bag with the fries and the sub. I noticed the large fry was half empty. Went to reach for the fries and when I put my fingers on the French fry it was room temperature. Pulled the container they were in out of the bag to see if the rest fell to the bottom of the bag. When I noticed they didn\u2019t, I also noticed that my side of pickles were missing. The steak bomb had barely anything in the sub.. more bread than steak and such. Lastly the crust on the pizza had more flavor than the actual pizza, it was absolutely flavorless. Oh, and it was as thin as paper and looked like a medium to me. Very very unhappy and will not be ordering dinner from here ever again.  I figured I would mention that I called to let them know how I felt about the food that I received. The woman on the phone offered me another order of French fries and my side of pickles to be sent to my house, while being sure to let me know that it would take them another hour to arrive.  Very cheap place. Good luck if you choose to dine here! You\u2019ll still be hungry after $35",

They do sell pizza by the slice, there\u2019s space to sit down, there are bags of chips for while you wait.  However, the pizza here is very good, somewhere between Boston and New York style. It is well-made, it is tasty, and it holds its own against heavy hitters\u2014the Papa Gino\u2019s across the street could not stand against them, and they are easily as good as any similar-topping-ed pizza I\u2019ve had from Bertucci\u2019s.  I highly recommend the eggplant rollatini, which is some of the best in the area. New York purists won\u2019t like the shape of the garlic knots, but they are just as yummy as the ones I\u2019ve eaten in the Bronx.",

What showed up was a long skinny thin calzone with enough chicken cutlet for a small sub. The worst part was it wasn't a chicken parm at all. It was chicken cutlet with a bunch of ricotta cheese and a little mozzarella. No sauce! Who puts ricotta in a chicken parm? Why was there no sauce? And why was it the exact thickness of the folded over dough...? There wasn't even an entire slit breath in  there. Just 3 pounded and thin cutlets. I was hoping to get more than a small subs worth of chicken for $14.00. I will be adding the picture of this gross calzone to the photos on here as well.",

Was staying a nearby hotel with friends for a bachelorette party a few weekends ago and decided to order local pizza. We placed the order online during business hours, was charged for it and never actually received the pizza. There was no communication from them as to why it couldn't delivered and they didn't answer their phone during posted open hours when we tried call about the status of our order. Communication with them since that evening to have the charge removed has been terrible. They have continued to give us the run around and are only offering store credit even though we are not from the area. Such poor customer service and upsetting since we were trying to support a local business rather than ordering from a chain restaurant. Absolutely do not recommend this place!",

The food was so bad I logged into my google account (had to reset my password), just to make this review.  Something told me upon walking in, the food wasn't going to be good. However, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt because of the other reviews on yelp. If you live in medford and you are craving pizza/calzones do not get it from Wellington pizza. Maybe they have good subs, I don't know but I would highly doubt they do.  I ordered a pepperoni calzone and literally the result was rubbery dough, greesy, flavorless cheese, with the cheapest pepperoni. There wasn't even sauce inside which made it so dry and just unpleasant and distasteful.  There was sauce on the side, however, which I was hoping could save the meal, but even the sauce was disgusting. It definitely wasn't pizza sauce or marinara, just some cheap canned sauce watered down and again-flavorless. I literally opened a can of my own sauce at home before i could take my SECOND bite.  You know, i'm not a mean person, but that was literally the worst way to spend my money. I threw the entire box in the trash after the third bite. Wellington pizza staff, I wish you spared me the experience and suggested I purchase something you might actually be good at making.  I hope readers don't think I have some kind of personal vengeance against the staff here, i don't. When reading this review keep in mind that i'm just an honest consumer trying to save other consumers from wasting their money on the lowest grade of food.  If you're in the area and are desperate for pizza, cross the street and go to papa ginos. Although they aren't much better. Anything is better than Wellingtons pizza. It's obvious they don't care about their customers.  Thank you.",

        "caption": "As transplants from NYC our biggest complaint about Boston was it's lack of good pizza by the slice. Not even good, just decent pizza! Not only did we find one that's good, it was in our neighborhood this whole time.  My husband a cook came out of Wellington's with a big smile, \"It looks like new york pizza, I have a good feeling about this place.\" Thin crispy crust, good sauce with the cheese so hot it's sliding off. Yes! This is good pizza. It's not fancy, it's just really good every day pizza, like the one we grew up on. We talked to the store workers convinced they were NYC transplants as well. Turns out Wellington apprenticed under Armando of Armando's in Cambridge. Best pizza in Boston in our books!",
