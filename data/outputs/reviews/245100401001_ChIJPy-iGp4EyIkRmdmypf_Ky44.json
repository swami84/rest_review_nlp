They had no complaints. The salad was huge, she was happy with it and the girls said the sketti was pretty good too. Staff was pretty nice as well. Con Doesn't really seem like a family friendly atmosphere, for my 2 small daughters anyways. More of and adult  style setting. With bar and all. Just my own opinion. So take that with a grain of salt.  I'd recommend this place for the food.",

Heavy, cheesy Italian food with a heavy dose of Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack.  The fried calamari was so breaded and fried in the old oil that I could taste what was fried before.  The lasagna was swimming in melted cheap cheese that became a sea of lard.  The crab cake was sub par, an insult for the area, very bland and dry, did not have much flavor.  The chicken parmigiana was a tad better, but it did not come out right, as the pasta was dried and the sauce was so tangy for our taste.  The house salad was the best, comparing to its entrees, in line with the normal antipasto style.  The food was diner quality, diner in a remote outpost. Service was adequate.   The high price was way too high, not justified.  It is a crime to charge so much for so little, and for something that not even was worthy eating.  We felt misled by other 4 star reviews.  This restaurant served up the worst meal that we ever had in our recent memories.  We will remember it for a long time.  Will not come back under any terms...  Diners beware..... stay away while you still can.",

The interior has its historic original structure that was spared by the great Baltimore fire of 1904 so it's 100% authentic classical ambience. It has a calm and cool atmosphere as Frank Sinatra cinema plays in the background. Russel was such a great bar tender. One thing I know will keep me going back to a place is the quality of service and this guys fits the bill. He has a great sense of humor, always there to serve, and great person to have a talk.

I walked to every steak place to the edges of the harbor and back inland. Steaks are very expensive in a harbor town with no cattle country. Premium Angus cuts even more so. This was the absolute cheapest price that I found anywhere. Most steak houses were $75-$100+ per plate. We had a group of 9 people. Shoot me! Birthday gal insisted on a steak venue. Their prices are the lowest and very reasonable for that area. Here I am on a Saturday at 6:30 pm being told by my friends to try for a reservation for 8:00. Good luck! (I need new friends). At first it was no and then I did speak with Barbara who was extremely kind and helpful. She rearranged some things and offered 8:30. We took it and showed up early. We we seated early, introduced to Barb's best friend (her name escapes me now-my apologies) who came in special to work and wait on us. She was so upbeat and fun! The place is very old time rustic original looking. The birthday gal decided that she wanted a pasta dinner of some type instead. (You can't smack someone on their birthday). We really enjoyed everything immensely. The home baked bread was so good that my wife wanted to go back the next day just because of it. They had a jazz band and then karaoke. Somewhere in the middle they let my daughter go up and play their old piano. She had no piano learning and had just spent the last few months teaching herself Bohemian Rhapsody from Youtube clips. It's the only thing that she can play at all but the people liked it and were disappointed to see her stop playing afterward. It really made for a nice time when we were all 3,000 miles from our homes. At the end of the evening with all of the drinks and birthday perks I would say that we spent about half of what we would have elsewhere. Great food and great people there. Thanks!",

I called this place to see if reservations were required and was told no. I also asked were the steaks half priced and the gentleman that answered said yes. My family and I went and ate and noticed that we were pretty much the only ones there but that was ok. We ordered and the waitress who we found out later was also the manager asked a few friendly questions and where were we from was one of them. When we ordered we told her we would be paying separately. The waitress said she could not split the check but would be able to take individual cards. We said that was ok and began to eat. When the meal was over she brought the check and said we were to figure out who had what and pay all together. Explained to her that I called as well as my brother and we were both told by a gentleman that steaks were half priced.  She said he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about and that\u2019s for regular customers anyway. My brother told her the same thing and the tone in her voice went from 0 to 15. We were appalled at this and felt that this was a SCAM so we just chalked it up and said whatever let\u2019s just pay and leave.  We asked several times for her to just give us a total of wwhat we had as there were several that would be paying together. At this time she became EXTREMELY upset and said our equipment is old and this takes too much time. She then, in her extreme anger state, said I told y\u2019all this prior to ordering. We explained to her that we came here to eat, not to do mathematics. At this point she just snatched the ticket from the table and walked away saying fine I will split it up. Of course there mistakes on the bill but at this point we were done. We notified the hotel of our experience and they said Seriously?????",

Karaoke every night of the week is probably not going to be the best business strategy. The services is the only redeeming factor, but the kitchen seems to constantly be running behind. This all is combine together with prices that are way to high for the overall quality. I would not recommend this place except for intoxicated individuals after 11:30. They won\u2019t care about the poor food, environment, and kitchen service.  The 5 star reviews here are very misleading for a restaurant that charges as high of prices. They claim to be a \u201cprime\u201d steakhouse. This means that a steak from Supano\u2019s will run you upwards of $30-50. However, you can go just a few blocks to Capital Grille and have an infinitely better dining experience. Unless you are a super big Frank Sinatra/karaoke fan, I would steer well clear of the high prices and cheap atmosphere of this place.",

Sadly the second we walked in the hostess/server, before even greeting us, walked up to us and suggested we go to the bar downstairs as they were short staffed. We walked downstairs and realized it was just a bar and not a bar/food setting, then came back upstairs and stood for five minutes. Nobody ever came back to seat us and we eventually just left. Really sad because I was looking forward to trying this place but someone needs to talk to their employees because that\u2019s not the proper way to greet a potential customer",

In their defense, we did not order steak - so if you want to enjoy this place order wine with your steak to make it taste better. Never plan to eat here again.",

To give you an idea, I recently had a steak in Florence and Supanos steaks remind me of that quality! The wine and beverage selection is vast and I love that there are several huge rooms with bars and the coolest VIP lounge in town. The service is great and the owner is top notch! He always takes care of me and my guests.  I cannot recommend this place enough. It\u2019s hard to find a classy, professional restaurant in the city...this is the real deal.",

My wife had been there for work lunch and had a poor experience as well which was strike two but we tried it again anyway. I guess we were slow learners that day but we figured how bad could a restaurant week lunch special be. lol. Anyway...our server was nice enough however there didn\u2019t appear to be anyone else working but her. She seemed to be the bartender, server, busser, food runner, bread maker and maybe even the cook for all I know. I had eggplant parmigiana which was Soggy and tasted like slop. My wife had lasagne unlike anything weve seen before which caused my wife to immediately be nauseated. She had to literally step outside to get her bearings back. Not sure what happened but this place was not worth a visit. Their house ipa was good however but other than that this place, Supanos will be on my do not return list to be sure we never end up their by mistake again.",

Hahaha we only went here bc there's some shady deal going on with the Radisson hotel \"shuttle\" who's vehicle was broken and would pay for our Uber only if we went to this restaurant. It's obviously a frat house drinking location and should stay that way. Stop trying to play Frank Sinatra and conning people into over priced food cooked by a 5th grader on her first day of work. Sweat tea means just that not Pepsi or Sierra mist. And if someone accidently orders a Coke product after you said Pepsi dont cop an attitude with a 10 year old, giving her a lesson on the difference! Even with our \"half off discount\" it was $43 for the three of us, even with sending back everyone's food once and then giving up and remained a Christian and just pay and leave. Ugh! Wish I had the time to complain for another 4 hours about our experience and the establishment. And their shady partner Radisson hotel - don't stay there either. Groupon got us good with that so called deal.",

I was no party of 8, aaaaaaaand she hadn't fore-warned me a tip was already added.... I was about to add another on top of THAT....  Difficult to accept this method of doing business.

I've owned 3 pizzarias and know a thing or two about food and service. We had trouble getting ANYTHING. Water, fork, knife, the check. And it wasn't very busy. I will usually leave 20% as a bad tip. Today was first time I can remember leaving only about 12%. Maybe if service was over the top it would have been easier to digest the high prices. I'm well aware of the location. Like I mentioned above I was in the business and I've had a store in an extremely busy touristy area. When you serve pasta a those prices you should at least get bread and salad. The place came highly recommend btw. As bad as it was I'll give anyplace a second chance. But probably won't be around the area again.",

And she was quite unpleasant and borderline rude towards new patron singers. Which might explain why there is such a small gathering of her followers for a Friday night. Be careful...be very careful as to how you treat your new customers. They're not only secret shoppers but secret restaurant reviewers who can highlight a hot karaoke spot. And this is surely not one. So........if the owner of the establishment is reading this, take note of this sub par review of this notation. This place is not worth one beer with your present subcontractor. Obviously, the owner does take notice of the reviews. But only willing to accept the false positive reviews which doesn't outnumber the real negative reviews.

We ordered the antipasto and a stromboli which for an Italian restaurant should be staples of their menu. The antipasto was tasteless and seemed to be overly wet like they rinsed everything in water and through it on the plate. The stromboli arrived and it was tiny, my wife took one bite and asked if it was prepared fresh to which she was told no but the calzone was if we would like that instead. After a long wait the calzone arrived, much larger than the stromboli but had what looked like precooked sausage nuggets throughout that ruined the taste. I will say the red sauce served with it was fresh and tasty but that couldn't save the meal. Our server was overly apologetic for the food and did knock some off the bill but like they say you only get one chance to make a first impression and it was not a good one for us.",

And a little pricey, since everything is a la carte (including substituting gluten free pasta for regular pasta).  But, it's definitely worth a visit, especially for the steaks.

It's a karaoke bar with $15 apps that are frozen and $40 entrees that come out the completely wrong item, 20 minutes after ordering - then after the order was corrected it came out missing 2 out of 4 items. We were still charged our full bill despite the continued screw ups by the kitchen. The wait staff wasn't terrible, he was actually semi decent, but even if you were there for happy hour (or karaoke in this case) they were out of most of their beers on tap and the kitchen clearly had no organization. Regretting making this our one place to eat in Baltimore this trip. I felt like I was on a really bad episode of Kitchen Nightmares - pre Gordon Ramsey, the whole experience.",

Our server was slow, unattentive, rude and argued with 2 customers. He is not an experienced server who understands jow to provide good service. The menu is way overpriced. The food is terrible. My food was brought out cold! The pasta sauce that came on the side of pasta tasted funny. The only thijgs that were good was the water and bread. They charge you a $1 music fee on your bill for karaoke after a certain time. This place left a very bad taste in my mouth and I will never ever go back nor do I recommend it. Beware if you have a large group more than 5 as they will add a 20% gratuity to your bill despite the horrible service or good service you receive. We all work hard for our money and of course no one should tell you how to spend it or tip a server that is truly not qualified to serve. Skip this place if you can for the food. The food might be better off the sports bar menu. The sports bar is down below.",
