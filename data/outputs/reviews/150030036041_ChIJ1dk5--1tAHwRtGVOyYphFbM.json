The takoyaki were big doughy balls of yum, the yakisoba was perfectly seasoned, not too oily, and everything was still warm by the time I'd gotten home to eat it, even though I bought it from the counter as opposed to ordering. If you need good, reasonably priced food to go and only have a few minutes, this is the place.",
