They gave me the sauce on the side when I did not ask for that, sauce had like five carrot slices and a few pineapple chunk\u2019s  The hot and sour soap was not spicy at all nor sour tasted like a mixture of wonton and plain veggie broth. I got to the end of the bowl and had nothing but sesame oil. Wanted so badly for it to taste good smh  Rangoos were decent.

The vegetable soup was packed wrong and spilled out and burned me, then the malaysian curry stew was cooked wrong; it wasn't even liquid it had a consistency of jello but it was hot - What? Then the Roti bread was so saturated in oil, I refused consume it. I never received the spring rolls and waited over an hour for my order AND IT WAS A PICK UP! I didn't notice the spring rolls were missing bc they made me late to return to work from lunch so I had to get out of there. When I called to complain, they gave me such a hard time. The person that answered was so rude. They said there's a new chef.. Well he can't cook and I'm never going back now! I was actually excited for lunch and waited until almost 5pm... For the food to go in the TRASH!",

I don't know what they put in that burger, but I get it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. My favorite thing about it is that it isn't that fake meat substitution stuff, and it is actually made with oatmeal (i think?) and kale, and it is just amazing. I often get the samosas which is always made so well, and the sauce for it is perfect. The prices and portions you get are extremely decent. I could go on and on. I often come for pickup, and have had some issues with not getting everything I ordered (I had to walk back and get it), or one the of delivery guys took my pickup order by accident ( I had to wait pretty long that time), but the staff is always kind and apologizes. Just don't go when you are in a rush :). The desserts they have are also great (they don't make it there, so a little pricey)! I always pick up a cake when I am craving something sweet. Thanks for being great!",

The ambience is also nice at the restaurant, but service was unbelievably slow at dinner time given there were only three other tables in the restaurant.  I never want to rush the kitchen but they actually lost my order and had to ask me again to re-make the items I requested.

The drumsticks were interesting, they had a sugar cane \"bone\" with a fluffy interior and a crispy exterior that went amazingly well with the aioli sauce.  The atmosphere was quaint but welcoming with a real strong push towards welcoming the vegan life. Lily, the owner, was a real spark of joy in the experience, my partner and I really loved her from the beginning to the end as she was attentive, kind, and gave us such great service.

The bread it comes with is so tasty! The drumsticks, chicken nuggets, and currys are all great. I wasn't a fan of the mac and cheese though.  The vegan donuts from Vegan Treats bakery are worth the trip by themselves. Despite being a chocolate lover, the coconut cream-filled donut is my favorite. They also have kombuha and their housemade tea a treat.  The service is hit or miss unfortunately. The food is fast but the servers could be more friendly and more attentive. Some of them have been wonderful, others on the grumpy side.",

I have also heard the story of the founder so I had high hopes for this place and came with the expectation of having a memorable experience. That was shattered very quickly.  First off let me just mention before I forget because this irks me. The 15% off 25.00 or more and the 5% off from check-ins...will not be honored.  Sooo, I bring my girlfriend and her mother here to eat. From the all the great things I hear, I did not expect it to look (as another reviewer commented) as if it has not been updated since 1990. I myself would say closer to 1985. This in itself could be forgiven as I am the first to run into the grimiest looking places in other countries if I hear the food is good. However, you must, first of all, have good food and second at least try to have some type of decent customer service.  Let's go with that last part there that truly made this a visit that I would much rather forget. This waitress (holding back using additional adjectives here) must have been the worst I have ever encountered. In my rush to leave, I did not get the name. Note to staff: this occurred 10/09/2019 around 5:00. She was not only rude but a bit confrontational and downright disrespectful. I was holding my tongue due to the fact of being in the company of my girlfriends' mother. The same goes for her because I could see my girlfriend was about to lose it. I'll end that here as she deserves no more of my attention. Good luck with your short-lived service industry position.  As for the food. Blah. Well, let me take that back as we ordered different menu items and two of them were good. The first being some type of alfredo pesto noodle. Not a hard dish to make but I'll give credit where its due. The next tasty item was the Rainbow Soy Wrap. The second place I've tried from and I'm a fan but would not be ordering from here again.  Here is something I've never encountered before. No option for anything to drink but water and hot tea! What? At a restaurant, c'mon. Well thats not entirely true. My girlfriend and I had the \"last two\" cold Thai Tea drinks according to the waitress. Her mother tried to order one shortly after us and found out the only option was water or hot tea. And as far as the hot tea is concerned. The waitress seemed a bit confused about that one as well so maybe there was only water.  I am really at a loss for words on this one and I shouldn't be as it was one of the worst experiences I ever had dining out. It just made it so much more uncomfortable because I was holding my tongue due to company and wanting to get up and leave the entire time but not wanting to do that to my guests.  Too bad I did not charge this one on the AMEX because it would be the first time ever disputing a meal out. lol. Honestly, this was uncomfortable and a terrible experience. My girl was also disgusted, this being after she has come here multiple times and recomended it.",

My husband goes to pick up the order and they only give him one rice. When he said there should be two they claimed the dish only needed one rice even through there are two orders! This isn\u2019t the first time this happened. And because they refused to give us what we paid for I refuse to ever spend my money here again.

The appetizers were really good and everyone in the party enjoyed them, but the entre\u00e9s and soups were lacking in finalized flavor. What I mean by that is, their recipes had good basic flavor, but the creators did not continue tweaking to reach the pinnicle of each dish. In otherwords, the main dishes tasted like something any low skill cook could out together at home. In an area that has low options for vegan caf\u00e9/resturants I do say I would visit once in a while. But the competition is fearce in Brooklyn and Loving Hut does not have what it takes to compete. I hope they take their dishes back to the test kitchen and work the recipes down a few more generations. Find the flavors, Loving Hut, that make our palates sing.",

I got the Loving Hut Burger which comes with yucca and sweet potato fries for a pretty decent price of about $9. I was excited by the size of the burger as it was huge, but was immediately disappointed a few bites in. The patty was not very tasteful, was mushy, and fell apart. There were cucumbers and mushrooms on the burger. The mushrooms were either very undercooked or raw, which I was not expecting. Everything just kept falling out of the bun and was messy and frustrating to eat. As for the fries, I\u2019ve definitely had better. The only reason why I got through most of the meal was because I was absolutely starving. I don\u2019t see myself returning.",

Besides good food the the staff super kind and helpful.   I wanted something really spicy sauce they put out a sauce that was really unique and I had never tried before and put it on my broccoli since my General Tsao's spicy enough.  I would highly recommend Loving Hut because  there are so many fun choices and that includes dessert their juices and smoothies and the service is excellent.  Loving Hut lives up so it's name.  A humble place with excellent staff and good food and generous portions.",
