My bestest tween and I didn't feel like roaming the 'hood or hopping on the train Saturday night, but Cheri's was present and we beat the dinner crowd.  My girl is picky and not big on meat, but definitely has discerning taste buds when it comes to burgers and fries.  All hands on deck at Cheri's are hospitable, smiling and set the great vibe. My stinka was smiling and talkative (rare these days... usually she displays funky 13 year old energy lol).  We reviewed the menus and she knew right away that she wanted a burger with fries.  I ordered the mac and cheese, along with bbq shrimp, crispy wings and a rum punch.  The burger and fries arrived and the burger was beautiful. After snapping a picture and admiring it, between conversation and drinks, she ate her fries and I noshed on the bbq shrimp and mac. Surprisingly, short stuff liked the mac too.  She doesn't like everyone's mac and cheese (especially unbaked varieties), and helped me eat most of it.  She offered me some of her fries, and they were delicious. Just as I was about to ask, I caught her taking the last bite of the burger, which was devoured faster than grease fire takes over!  She said, \"It's LIT!\" I guess I will find out during my next visit or burger craving moment.  We had a great conversation with the owner, our server, the bartender---- they're LIT and our little adventure was special, thanks to Cheri's Bedstuy. Blackcellence!",

I come from a long line of excellent southern cooks. This food was out of this world. I had the fried chicken  with red velvet waffles, and my friend ordered the shrimp. We got sides of yams, greens and potato salad, as well as the bread pudding. I cannot pick out which was the best because they each were incredible! Our food was like stopping by Mama\u2019s house and she had all of your favorite things! Do yourself a favor and stop by, but skip the bread pudding because I want it all for me!",

I love food and don\u2019t mind spending on it, but when it\u2019s just regular, i\u2019m not happy about it.  The bar, needs a lot of work, they have to get more creative with how they handle the lack of a full bar and pay attention to details. I shouldn\u2019t have to wait, wait, wait and then watch you digging through bodega bags for lemons/limes and 20oz ginger ales etc. come on folks, do what you have to do but don\u2019t let us see it. also, rinse off the lemons before you slice them \ud83d\ude09  We as poc are innovators, I want to see y\u2019all tap into that more and be more meticulous.
