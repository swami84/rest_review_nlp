There's plenty of space the airflow was great there were plants nearby. Now let's move on to the food because this was the best meal I've had in a year. The fried Branzino was amazing I didn't realize bronzino could taste even better than it has. We also tried the yuca appetizer it was so tasty. The snapper ceviche melted in my mouth.

I was excited to go back but for my first experience back \u2014 I\u2019ll have to to say their front of the house service has changed. They were rude when we were late to our reservation due to unforeseen circumstances in which we notified them about ahead of time. Proceeded to our table, i asked if they had an item on the menu (that was previously on their old menu), server responded \u201cif it\u2019s not on the menu, then we don\u2019t have it\u201d. Sorry this is just not a great customer service response. They proceeded to rush us through our dinner. For a place like alma i truly expected better comparing it to their old location.

Stopped by recently with a friend for restaurant week and sampled some of their other menu items. We had the kale salad, la caraquena arepa, seafood paella, duck magret, and coconut ice cream. Alma pay close attention to detail. The arepas are a must order. The breading, seasoning and combination of flavors were amazing. The paella had so much seafood and the textures from the bomba rice to the perfectly cooked seared scallops were delicious. The duck is a must order! The couscous, rich duck and berry sauce were amazing. The cocktails here were also delicious. Definitely recommend getting a carafe for the best value. I booked way in advance to get a table here. With current Covid conditions Alma takes it very seriously. Currently, only doing outdoor dining and they have the staff cleaning tirelessly. My friend and I were really satisfied with our food and service. I'll definitely be back to try the other arepas and seasonal menu items",

Alma is tucked away in plain sight at the canning company in Canton, but once you walk inside you\u2019ll be transported away from the city into a darling little oasis.  The foliage and tropical plants kindly invite diners in to a warm and recharging atmosphere. It\u2019s not uncommon to be greeted table-side by the owners Irena and Mark who are genuine and authentic folks deeply grateful to have guests at their table, so to speak. The environment and soulful intention translates into the staff and management team who are always kind and friendly. Create the right environment and you will attract only the best. Alma has done just that.  The best part really about Alma is that the food and drinks are hands down unlike any other you will experience in Baltimore. Every dish is a unique masterpiece creatively designed and superbly executed. I am most definitely a foodie and having also lived internationally I have a broad and eclectic palate. I find myself trying new dishes in shock thinking, \u201cWhere has this been my whole life? Why is it that at 35 years old I am only trying \u201cinsert blank\u201d for the first time?\u201d It\u2019s really a very eye opening and refreshing experience every time.  You cannot go wrong by choosing Alma over the larger restaurant groups in Baltimore. Alma\u2019s essence is something special nowhere else has even touched. Thank you Alma Cocina Latina for being the Latin soul kitchen my heart and this city needs.  Favorite starters: the rabbit paradise, octopus & cracker, caramelized honey chipotle wings. Favorite entr\u00e9es: vegan forest, latin ramen, middle east duck. Favorite dessert: 5 layer coconut cake (oh how I love thee) Favorite drinks: red sangria, Papa Hemingway, cielo verde.",

One thing was kinda odd. I was there for a medical lecture dinner and asked if I could have something to go (more then willing to pay for it), and the manager said they had no to go containers. Now I don't know if that was just for my night or its like that ever night.  Parking was free so big plus for downtown.  Staff was friendly enough but one would expect that level of professionalism from a fancy place like this.  I would recommend trying this place if you haven't already.",

The Venezuelan cuisine the have here is phenomenal. From being from Northern Virginia and knowing alot of (Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Mexicans) and indulging in their cultures foods growing up, Venezuelan food is distinctly different. There are multiple flavor that you can get out of a few dishes and you normally wouldn't think of. The owner Irena is so lovely, she is the sweetest and kindest soul you will ever meet. She takes so much pride with the restaurant and the staff and it definitely shows. Highly recommend going to Alma Cocina if you haven't already and try your palette on a new experience.",

They change the menu with good frequency - enough that you don't get bored, but still keep around dishes that you can keep coming back to eat. They have very, very good platanos (and I'm picky). They have a good selection of liquor, and they make one of the best pisco sours (highly recommend their happy hour specials). Overall, the place has a great atmosphere, is very well lit and modern. The waitstaff are very kind and always remember us when we come back. Definitely a must-try - and must-return.",

The ambiance and food at Alma are really excellent. However, to our surprise, the service was beyond TERRIBLE. It was RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL.  At first, the waiter seemed very annoyed by answering basic questions about the menu. That was bad but OK, after all maybe she was having a hard day, right?...  Then, we had a minor issue with the check, and she brought up the manager. Then things got really TERRIBLE.  For the record, the minor issue was that we needed to split the check to pay with corporate credit cards, but they don't split checks for whatever reason.  The manager came to our table with a VERY patronizing, sarcastic, and rude tone. His poor behaviors included pointing his finger at us, calling one of us \"ignorant\" (yes, that happened), and not properly listening to us.  The manager kept saying in an ACCUSATORY tone that we were wrong by expecting them to split the check for us. Well, even if he had a point (which it didn't matter at that point), why on Earth he had to treat us with DISRESPECT and SARCASM? We were customers trying to pay for the food we ordered, for God's sake. This man managed to make us feel TERRIBLE after eating at Alma.  This very minor issue with our check really escalated to an unforgettable and scary experience at this fine restaurant. What a bitter taste this manager left on us after spending about $280 on a dinner.  We are very agreeable and reasonable customers. Very rarely we complain. To the owners: I truly believe there is a very toxic work environment at Alma created by this manager. I now feel really bad for the waiters and the fantastic Cook at Alma. I strongly suggest you to investigate the manager's behaviors.",

However the manager (Paul) of the restaurant was very rude to us, and refused to apologize when his behavior was addressed. The servers at the restaurant apologized for his behavior. He seems to have anger and comprehension issues, which his staff seem to be aware of. We were told when we walked in that happy hour was only available if you sat (for the entirety of your meal) at the bar. That was fine. We sat at the bar, but witnessed someone coming to the bar to order and then taking their drink back to a table that was not at the bar. When we asked the manager why this was allowed in this instance, we were informed that the area the person was seated in was designated the bar as well even though he was at a table. We were told that there was a bar and a dining room, and that happy hour was only served in the bar.  We understood this and did not have an issue with this part of his explanation. However, when the manager told us there were no servers in the bar area, it aroused a question given the fact that we had seen several servers around the table area designated as the bar space. When asked to clarify about the existence of servers serving customers in an area we were told was not supposed to have servers, the manager became agitated, and started raising his voice at us so loudly that all of his staff and onlookers in the restaurant took notice. He repeated that there was a bar area and a dining area (about 6 or 7 times) while waving his hands wildly.  When told that a question was specifically being asked about why there were servers seen in the area he said was not supposed to have servers, he continued to repeat the same refrain about the fact that there was a bar area and a dining area, without answering the question. I should mention that the manager is an American, and no language barrier existed between us. He simply did not understand the question being asked, and instead of handling the situation calmly, began to raise his voice and speak down to his customers (us). He was eventually interrupted by the bartender, who had been watching and appeared to be attempting to jump in. She understood our question immediately, and answered professionally without any trouble.  When he left our area we were apologized to by several servers for his behavior.  There are several other good South American inspired cuisines in the area if you want to go to one with a better manager, which I would highly reccomend. Sota Sopra, Points South (apologies if spelling is off) both have better or comparable food with comparable or cheaper prices, and might be a better dining experience.",

We did the prie fixe menu and I can\u2019t wait to come back in the future. Thanks everyone",

My wife asked about the spiciness of the pork dish since she doesnt like hot food and the waiter told her it wasnt bad, she couldn't finish it. My polenta was bland, tasteless, completely tasteless , same as eating a piece of cardboard. My kids had a couple of very small arepas ( $ 12 each ) also tasteless. We asked for cassava bread for the table, it came a t a whopping price of $ 12 if we wanted guacamole with that, another $ 6. This place has terrible food at exorbitant prices ( and I travel for work so I constantly dine on high rated restaurants , so I can make a judgement )",

We walked in the door, and were seated quickly however the restaurant was out of menus, so we shared 1 for 6 of us for about 10 minutes.  The restaurant was about 1/2 to 3/4 full.  We ordered rounds of drinks, and had about a 10 to 20 minute wait each time we ordered, sometimes they came out with garnish, sometimes the didnt.  The 2 main entree items we wanted to try were both out (bear in mind it's 7pm on Saturday night). Almost everthing from the Kitchen came out properly all be it slowly (and was delicious).. That said we ordered a few steaks, (medium and medium rare).  They both came out somewhere between medium well, and well.   As the Kitchen was running pretty slowly we didnt want to deal with sending them back.. We skipped dessert but the house brought us some home made kit kats (frankly those were better than the steak I ordered).",

We went here for Valentine's Day which had a great looking Valentine's Day menu, but after looking at the regular menu we had to try the dishes and I'm so glad we did. We ordered the tartar del mar and tostones del diablo which were phenomenal. For our entr\u00e9es we ordered ossobuco and pulpo al ajillo which tasted as good as it looked. I wish we had room to try a few more dishes, but with those four dishes we were so full. Honestly I thought I was going to still be hungry when I first saw the dishes being served, but after everything both of us were actually full. I definitely recommend Alma Cocina. I even attached my receipt so you could see the breakdown of how much all of this cost and how reasonably priced everything is. If you get the chance, try this place. You will not be disappointed.",

I'll just make a list of stuff  1) 2 main entrees we're off the menu when we came...not a great start... 2) server said everything was entree sized .... definitely not the case. Cheaper stuff is definitely tapas sized. Split 4 things for 3 people and was definitely hungry at the end (after dessert and an appetizer eaten at home) 3) arepas are huge but the meat was a bit over cooked....also the things are sloppy and all the fixings are at the bottom so it's a bit of a pain to eat 4) GREAT cocktails 5) the churros we're also out for one of the two orders we wanted. Once we got them, the churros themselves we're undercooked, the \"Nutella\" wasn't Nutella and was bland, the ice cream was melted and lacked flavor. 6) they served one dish (billed as a take on nachos) on an 18\" diameter plate...HUGE!! And there were 3 small pieces.... definitely a pain for the table 7) the tartare was AMAZING  So, my 3 star experience is definitely for the experience as a whole. The restaurant is probably more of a 4 if you include the nice atmosphere and pretty good staff",

        "caption": "Our first meal at Alma Cocina Latina was -- bar none -- the best meal I've had in Baltimore in ten years.  I do a pretty good job of staying up to speed on the newest and best restaurants in Balto...it's my home town and not that big a place.  I was aware of Alma Cocina Latina, but hadn't yet been by as I live in the sweet spot between Hampden/Remington/Woodberry/Charles Village/Roland Park.  We can walk to scores of the best restaurants in town in 15 mins...no need to venture down to Canton.  Then I read the rave in WaPo and put Alma Cocina Latina on the \"must do\" list.  So glad that we did.  We were greeted by a familiar face...former front of house guy at The Food Market -- and seated quickly. We explained to Scott, our server, that we were generally unfamiliar with Venezuelan food -- outside arepas -- and would be happy for him to walk us through the menu.  He took precisely the right amount of time...explaining and answering questions without hovering or being supercilious.  We tried the Ceviche Mixto after confirming that the octopus was going to be prepared in some way other than a quick bath in citrus/acid.  We were assured that it is cured (sorry, but semi-raw octupus is not a way I'm going to start a meal).  This ceviche  was among the best I've ever eaten, and the portion was surprisingly large...easily enough to split and satisy as an appetizer for two.    I asked specifically about the micro-greens as the were pretty 'flavor forward' in spots and learned that the sous chef grown them personally.  I expect that since they were very fresh, they were prominent.  Having sampled something from the sea, we had meat(s) in an arepa...deciding on the \"Mariposa\" (why they named it \"butterfly\" I can't say.  Go there.  Ask.)  It also was the best I've had...though it was so 'overstuffed' that it would be impossible to eat by hand w/o wearing some home on the front of one's shirt.  We left it on the plate and took turns forking out seared chicken, tender stewed beef and a delightfully underspiced chorizo.  When we got it down to a manageable size, we picked it up and discovered the fried egg and avacodo in the base which had benefited greatly from the juice and spice from above.  Then is was 'vegetarian' entree, also gluten free, medanos de falcon.  Scott described the kitchen's attempt to replicate the desert region from which it is inspired as \"terroir\" which I think may have not been the right term.  (I understand that to mean that the flavor of the area in which the ingredients are grown infuses the product.)  The description of the dish when presented indicated this was am much a visual representation as a flavor one...so maybe \"terroir with visuals\".  Anyway it was 'lick the plate\" delicious and the black bean/sweet coconut puree that dotted the dish was a revelation.  Just try it.  If you have a vegetarian friend who always feels kinda left out take them to Alma Cocina Latina and order this.  Friend for life.  We'd saved room for dessert and are very grateful we did.  When our \"marquesa\" was brought to the table, Scott went uncharacteristically quiet.  I asked why and he said the dish was such a mixture of unfamiliar textures and flavors that he'd prefer to come bacj when we were done and ask how it was.  Good call. It's a melange of Almond butter cream, macadamia & almond crumble, vanilla toffee, lemon zest, vanilla-caramel ice cream, almond cracker, citrus meringue.  I mean who thinks of putting lemon into meringue and making a cracker out of it?  The almond butter cream and the ice cream are the same color...but different flavors, textures and temperatures...so it's an interactive mystery to eat.  Anyway...sheesh.  I have not intended to take this much time raving about this place.  It was great.  Go.",

The food here is *out of this world*. I have been to this restaurant 5 or 6 times now for a full course meal, and every time I am blown away by the dishes served (I've ordered something different every time). The menu is vibrant and creative - there really is not anything else like it in Baltimore. If you have not been to Alma Cocina Latina yet, you must. Not only are the food and cocktails exquisite, but the staff here really make the dining experience special - everyone is warm and excited to tell you about the food and the Venezuelan culture. So much love for this place. 5 stars just isn\u2019t enough.",

My Sangria was very flavorful and my Husband's beer and port were very good too. The flavors are fresh and new to our pallets, and very yummy. The service was great. The ambiance was modern, kind of \"canteen-ish\", but quite cozy (the only unpleasant thing we've experienced is the cold drift from the entree door openings). In point of value it's not cheap but worth it. Next time we'll order more of their appetisers and desserts that we enjoyed a lot rather then entrees. Also a big + is free and easy available parking. All together it was not quite a 5** but still great experience and we definitely will be back.",

The staff are prompt and knowledgeable. The drinks are pretty great. A lot of rum-based offerings, so if that's not your thing it's too bad because the ones I tried were well balanced with unique flavors. The arepas are basically flawless. I had the cochinillo and could have had at least two more of them but also wanted to try a proper entree. Definitely the right call. Had the ceviche mixto, which at $20 was a great deal with urchin, shrimp, octopus carpaccio, scallops and more I surely forgot. Everything was prepared perfectly. With some even bigger priced items, this felt like a place for special occasions but if you want to just get arepas you couldn't find a better space in Baltimore.",

The interior is also very nicely adorned with wall hung plants and modern tables and bar and it makes for a great dinner experience.",

        "caption": "A new addition to the Boston Street Restaurant scene, Alma Cocina Latina brings new dimension to the local dining scene with some unique Venezuelan specialties. The lobster and squid ceviche in a tomato based sauce was different from the citrus focused versions most other restaurants served, but was delicious. The appetizers are also excellent and great for sharing. On the drinks side, Alma Cocina offers a good amount of unique cocktails and a strong selection of wines and sangria. The atmosphere was lively for a Saturday night, and there was even salsa dancers for entertainment, of which some of the staff joined in on. Overall it was a very good experience, though they appear to be positioning themselves on the higher end of the dining experience, with higher prices to go with it.",
