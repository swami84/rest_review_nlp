The service is alright, though production of the products tends to be lobsided, for example asked for sour cream on my three tacos, because they were using a spoon to apply it one taco got a huge amount the next got a little and the third barely got any. I only come to this location once in a long while, when I am really craving a halfway decent taco. But the quality from here is not always the best.",
