        "caption": "Pay very careful attention to the prices for items, as they can change significantly and without warning. Perhaps not unique to this location, I discovered after the fact that one item I purchased regularly suddenly went from its usual $3.69 to $4.99 (35% increase) from one visit to the next a few days later. The lower price was never listed as \"promotional\" or \"limited time\". It's my fault for not paying closer attention to prices, but with a store modeled for speed and efficiency, I think this sort of variability is egregious. Still a convenient and quick option, but it does leave a bad taste in my mouth. Lesson learned: I will be more wary with all of my purchases here in the future.",
