Sat at the bar, the chef was very friendly and introduced every piece as it was being presented. Some nice conversation since I was the only customer at the sushi bar which only seats a couple people. There's no tables and the only additional seating is a bar facing the window that seats very few people.  The food was delicious, chef was very friendly and gracious, server was fantastic, quick and friendly. My only reason that I had to knock one star is the omakase pricing is quite high and didn't quite deliver the range of flavors and challenging of the senses as I've come to expect from other omakase establishments. It's still a great choice thanks to the convenient location, fast service, and reasonable pricing outside of omakase.",
