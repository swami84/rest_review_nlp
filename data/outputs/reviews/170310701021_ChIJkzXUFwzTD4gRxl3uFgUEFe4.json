On that front, Toro continues to have high quality fish. The first time ordering with them, Toro messed up our order and sent us some of the wrong rolls. We called and they offered a discount on a future order over the phone, but never actually sent us the discount. We tried them again tonight, and this time our sushi was missing sauces, had components that weren\u2019t listed (wasabi in the roll, lemon flavored tobiko), and as a result just didn\u2019t taste that good.",

I also order carryout from there quite often. It is my favorite sushi place in Lincoln Park because it is very high quality with low frills. The super white crunch roll, spring blossom roll, kamikaze hand roll and hamachi hand rolls are personal favorites. The nigiri is also great and reasonably priced. Overall, great and friendly environment and awesome sushi - I highly recommend.",

Be prepared to wait 1-2 hours if you get here after 6pm. Put your name in and then walk down the street to DOC's wine bar and enjoy a glass or bottle of wine or Duke's Chicago bar.  Party's of 4 are ideal as the place is small.  My favorite rolls: Oh My God, Sunny, & spicy tuna roll. This is my favorite sushi place in Chicago.",

We were able to get a seat without a problem. All the tables were filled by 6pm, and the wait started getting long by 6:30pm, so arrive earlier to beat the wait. Parking is street, so good luck.  Everyone ordered at least two rolls, which was about enough food.  1. OMG Pretty good. Some of my friends agreed that it was probably the best roll out of the 8+ we ordered.  2. Kamikaze Very good. Toppings were delicious, and it had the perfect amount of spiciness.  3. Arizona Very good. Definitely in my top three favorite rolls.  4. Crazy horse  5. Al fuego Pretty good. Couldn't really taste the difference between this one and some of the other rolls.  6. Green tea ice cream Very good. Generous scoop of green tea ice cream with some chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. Green tea wasn't overbearing at all.  My friends who had the salmon nigiri said it was very good.  Overall, very good sushi. Rolls are around $12-15 each, and there is 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more. My total was about $33 after tax/tip.",

They would not hold a table. Not deterred, I took a cab from my Gold Coast apartment to Lincoln Park to this place and there was a table open when I got there. They wouldn't give it to me. There was no line, and yet I was informed that the fictitious \"waiting list\" was such that I would have to wait an hour and a half. There was no one waiting. I have never been treated so poorly by a sushi restaurant before, and I will never go back. The staff lied, and was incredibly discourteous. I went to another sushi restaurant in Lincoln Park called \"Nori.\" They seated me immediately, and the quality was very high. Ordinarily, I don't like to complain, but the experience with the wait staff at Toro was so bad I would be remise if I did not write a review. There are excellent sushi restaurants all over Chicago, and with service this horrible, it amazes me that they remain in business. An absolute disgrace to Chicago's sushi scene.",

All the people who gave it 5 stars are probably just people who never really had real sushi. Here is why:  The chef is passionate about what he does, somewhat cocky about it too, for such an attitude you'd expect the sushi to taste good, but it is just alright.  the wasabi tasted really bland  their soy sauce is not even made right, they just bought store bought soy sauce and pour it into a jar and used it!!! Let me tell you, the soy sauce for real sushi is not just some store bought soy sauce! there is more ingredients to it.  Their rice taste kind of weird.....but i don't care much for rice anyway  The only good thing about this place is the fact that their fish pieces are larger than other places most sushi restaurants make the fish cut same size as the rice under it but this place do give larger than normal cuts, so that is a pro. Will I go back? maybe....but i would probably not order their sushi.....perhaps their maki is a bit better but i'd have to try and see  ps. their miso soup is really really salty....",

I highly recommend the Volcano Rolls (SPOILER ALERT: They come out with a sparkler attached to the plate). All of the rolls were delicious.  Much like other sushi places in the city, they were BYOB, which is convenient as there was a liquor store just down the street. It's a small restaurant, so seating is tight, but the sound level stays relatively low and it doesn't distract from any discussions you want to have at your table.  There can be a long wait depending on when you go due to the small size of the restaurant, however we were able to get in really easy with just two people. It's a great place for a date, and I highly recommend checking it out.",

I suggest you go early to get in before the crowd. The staff is wonderful and Mitch is always fabulous. Try to sit up by the sushi bar. He and the other staff are so engaging. All the sushi is amazing.. you can't go wrong with any of them. Add this to your must go list in Chicago.",
