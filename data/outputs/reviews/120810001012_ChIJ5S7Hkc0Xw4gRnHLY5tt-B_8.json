I take most responsibility for not asking how much first but I never expected a side salad, cannoli, two pizzas and 4 garlic knots to cost me $70. I called back to question why 4 garlic knots was two containers of dough nuggets and was told that's how they package them. Although those little nuggets were delicious, I never would of ordered 4 orders if I knew what I was getting and that it would cost $25 (more than the two pizzas combined.) I couldn't find them anywhere on the online menu prior to ordering but figured I'd ask if they had them. Lesson learned, it just would of been nice to have a little explanation when I placed the order since they aren't your \"normal\" knots and they definitely cost a lot more.",

Be warned that any dishes pertaining meat will be mainly composed of pasta (more disproportionate than most Italian restaurants)  The low rating is mostly attributed to the serving staff. With two separate servers within two separate days, the service has been atrocious. I\u2019m currently sitting at a table now with very apparent upset customers sitting at tables next to me. No sense of urgency.  With the understanding that it is on the busier side, basic understanding on how restaurants work and how they respond to the pace of things will most likely keep me from returning as a customer.  Imagine waiting for the waiter to bring your card back to you all while watching him take 5 tables orders and serve 3 others. You would have though he may have wanted a tip. I ended up leaving one on the assumption it may have been his first day on the job.  I typically don\u2019t leave reviews unless I feel strongly one way or another. This was unfortunately for the lesser. There will probably be a generic \u201cappreciate the feedback. we\u2019ll aim to do better\u201d response but by the sheer amount I\u2019ve seen it copied and pasted on past reviews, it really doesn\u2019t mean much.  Overall- Food: 8/10 Service: 1/10",

Maybe I should have ordered a pizza. The house salad that my mother got the side salad that I got was all iceberg lettuce with sparse toppings. There seemed to be only one waitress. It took a little bit to order our food and to even get her attention. I don't think it was her fault for being spread too thin and not being able to cater to her tables properly. My mother had to get up and ask for something twice. Definitely not impressed with this place but it has a cute atmosphere. It was busy. Maybe I didn't order the right dish because it seems like everybody around us ordered pizza. maybe it's more of a pizza joint than anything",

        "caption": "The Worst experience at a restaurant, I have had over 6 states, probably in my entire life. We decided to go out for a nice home cooked Italian meal, being my Husband is Italian and All of Us Love Italian Food. We have Our Favorite Hidden Gems in NY, PA, GA, TN, and NC and have found quite a few in FL. They have really good reviews, but the few I notice are bad were not read until after our Horrible Experience. We have three young Children, and we went here for dinner. We had to park at the water front a few blocks over because I drive a Handicap accessible Ramp Van, which was the beginning of the Worst Experience Ever. If you know FL it's 90+ degrees outside and being outside is Not Always enjoyable. So the 6 of Us which included my Aunt who is in a wheelchair, made our way to what we thought would be Our Family Hidden Gem Spot. We saw a small amount of seating available a few tables were still available. So a Woman approaches us and asks how many in our party we say 3 adults and 3 kids. She said ok, but looked around confused. Then she asked if we had a reservation, I said no. She said that's okay and asked if we mind sitting in the hallway area we graciously agreed to try food we heard was delicious. Well after a few more minutes of confused looking and rearranging things, we get ready to sit. Suddenly we are told they have no room for Us. We are told we could eat outside if we wanted or wait until other people were finished, but then proceeded to tell us that everyone just sat down so it would be at least an Hour. Online it says Nothing or even Suggests to make a reservation, if I knew I needed too I would have because we planned this 2 hours prior. I made sure they were listed as a Handicap accessible and Child Friendly. Let me reiterate that I have 3 Starving Children with me, Yes they are Not literally starving, but if you are a Parent you know for Them it feels like They are going to die. Very Disappointed with how the ENTIRE thing was handled!!",

I asked if it was ok to order dinner and he said yes. Our pizzas(which were delicious) came out and when we asked the waiter if we could put the three pizzas in the next table to clear up some space, he refused, with no explanation. He refused to give us his name and just walked away. I had to get up and get some water for the table because he refused to attend to us. At the end of the meal, we asked him why he was acting this way, and did so very politely. He said that it would have dirtied up another table and made us feel that we were in the wrong for ordering at the last minute. He said that we were the worst people he's ever had.  Not fair. I have been travelling in Florida for 2 months and have NEVER been treated like this. I would not recommend  this restaurant because of the way we were treated by this staff member.",

We thought we would try Fav's Italian Cucina. Reviews are something my wife and I read, but don't necessarily use them for our dining decision. Needless to say Fav's had excellent food reviews but ours was not yest posted.  The location is on 12th Street tucked in to 5 or 6 other restaurants on the same block. The atmosphere was nice, it's easy to see how working with limited space can cause it's problems. There were restaurant supplies lying under counters, perhaps no other space was available to store them.  The waiters were dressed in t-shirts, some in shorts which took away from the brand and the experience. (black or gold logo'd t-shirts would have done the trick)  All of these slight minor and amateur nuances however, played no role in the product - the food. This might have been the best Italian food I have ever eaten. My wife felt the same, we left full and 100% satisfied.  As for the prices - perfect. We had a bottle of wine combined with a wonderful meal including salad and a side for $50.00. Normally this price would be associated with an inferior Italian style dinner. Not at Fav's. It's not often you find a tasty meal priced right.  Fav's was the place and we'll be coming back again and again until we have tried everything on the menu. See you next weekend Fav's and thank you for the experience. ~*",

The salad dressing was homemade and the hot bread and olive oil dipping sauce to start was as good as it gets. I stood up by the kitchen area and talked about cooking while they made our dishes. I felt like I was back in New York although Fav is from Harrisburg, PA! We just moved into the area although we have lived 30 minutes south for 15 years. I am so glad we tried the food. We will be back weekly for my Italian fix!",
