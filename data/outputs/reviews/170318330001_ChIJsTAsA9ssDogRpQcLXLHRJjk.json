So the next time the debate popped up, I suggested the place, we went... and I wholly regretted it. The atmosphere is nice enough, although the old american pop-ie music is a little off putting it wasn't too loud when we sat outside and could ignore it, the server was nice and bubbly, my cocktail was perfect and the food was presented beautifully, but none of that can make up for the taste. My bf eats just about anything, so he finished off his sushi although he did say he wasn't interested in coming back after just the first bite. I couldn't even eat the ramen though, it looked so pretty but tasted like something a college student would make out of an instant noodle package, with corn and half of a hard boiled egg tossed in just 'cause. The 'meat' was just a slice of fat and gristle, the broth had no body or flavor to stick to the noodle, I'm going to mention again the egg was hard boiled and somehow grainy, and WHY is there corn in it? We ordered two roles of sushi, one bowl of ramen, one fruit smoothie and one cocktail, and the meal was 59$ I took not four bites out of the ramen before I returned it and they still charged me for it, only discounting it to half when I complained about it. I wouldn't pay 3$ to eat that ramen, much less the 13 they charge for it! Even the blueberry smoothie was bland, I don't know how you can mess up blueberry but these guys did it.",

If you follow them on Facebook, they post some cool discounts and deals, too, like BOGOs. The ladies restroom is interesting - it's a black-lit room with a one-way mirror that faces into the dining area. All in all, though, this is my favorite local sushi place in the city.",
