The service was attentive and we added a bottle of Chianti to round out a wonderful meal. Reasonably priced for this level of quality and we all highly recommend!",

We order a second course of food, that arrived literally as the show ended.  This said... the French Toast was sublime, the gnocchi melted in your mouth and the egg is skillet was awful.

The food was as close to perfect as it gets... the Porchetta was moist and seasoned just the way I like it... and even though they didn't have a regular house salad on the menu, the chef happily made one for me upon my request.

The decor is very nice, the setting was quite lovely, except the ceiling tiles; a little dingy looking (ceiling tiles need to be replaced immediately), but nicely themed; painted, etc... Our waitress was melancholy, stressed and seemingly overworked with all the tables she had at once. At times, we ran out of ice tea, and waited a while for appetizers and food, but the service was not terrible (I tipped 20%). The appetizers (brussels sprouts) wwere very good. However, the rest of dinner was terrible at best. Our party of three tried the bread, cheese pizza, and lasagna and they were all terrible (flavor). The sauce on the lasagna tasted like a mixture of Ragu spaghetti sauce and carryout ketchup! The pizza was soggy, and the bread was hard as a rock, with no flavor at all (the second batch brought out was a little warmer and softer but still tasteless. Not what you expect from a italian restaurant). My wifes work colleague made us lasagna the other day that was far better in every aspect (taste, viscosity, warmth, presentation, spices, preparation,  etc...) HOWEVER... The live music (The Carl Grubbs Quartet) was simply amazing! Germano's Piattini supports live music from different local bands to play while having dinner. Because of this, even though the food was not good at all (except the brussel sprouts (me), and the cheesecake according to my wife) I will happily eat their again (music nights only). They must make some dishes that are good, right? I will exhaust them all for good obvionce, and live jazz music, which this place has!",

The food Is fabulous - I had the homemade pasta -Tagliatella Alla Bolognese, and had their homemade cheese cake which was out of this word.    I also visited Germano\u2019s Cabaret a couple weeks ago for dinner and a show.  What a great time.  The lamb chop dinner was also absolutely delicious.  The show was equally great.  If you are looking for a night out in Baltimore I highly recommend you go to Germano\u2019s.   The owner Germano is a wonderful person. This place is very special.",

Upon early arrival (7:30pm), the host confirmed our name on the reservation list and immediately proceeded to sit us at the bar. We were confused and thought there was no formal dining area. Two couples arrived after us and were seated upstairs in what seemed to be one of the formal dining areas. We then talked to the host about our reservation made days ahead and he agreed to move us to the dining area. As we waited at the bar with no service, after 10 minutes of waiting he informed us that all the tables were full. We said it was fine and decided to leave the restaurant. At this point, the host tells us that he could find us a table. We said thank you and left the restaurant. They seemed unapologetic and gave no importance to us, the customers. Furthermore, every restaurant we checked on this very cold night in Little Italy was full due the special occasion. Luckily, we found a restaurant that was accepting walk-ins, but this experience definitely left a very sour feeling to our night. I would not recommend Germano's Piattini to anyone!",

We went in for lunch and the waitress misunderstood my co-worker's order by giving him the \"large\" portion of lasagna instead of the \"small\" portion of lasagna (even though the menu just said lasagna!), which was about a $6 difference.  When we received the bill, my co-worker notified the waitress that he was overcharged, and that he only wanted to pay for what he had ordered. The waitress notified the owner, who immediately came over and said that the waitress assumed he wanted the \"large\" order because he was a \"big\" guy and that if he didn't want to pay for it he should stop eating his meal! We explained that the menu just says lasagna and that the waitress just assumed the size, rather then asking him. The owner said we were being unreasonable and that she has never had this problem over the last 30 years (which I find doubtful).  She finally agreed to charge my coworker the correct amount, but could still be heard muttering at us under her breath!  In summary, food was great, waitress was great, owners were extremely rude and inappropriate, and I will never go back!",

        "caption": "My wife and I were visiting from Arizonia. Spent the day touring the Inner Harbor, when she had a striking brilliant idea to walk over to Little Italy for a late lunch/early dinner. Most restaurants closed by 3pm and opened again at 5pm. Germano's was the only lace opened it seemed. The place was empty. The owners were conducting business at the bar, but quickly welcomed us in. The ambiance was cozy and quiet. Our service was excellent. (We were the only people there). She was informative and friendly. We ordered the fried calamari for starters. It was scarfed down quickly. I order the shrimp scampi and my wife had the gnocchi. Both were top notch! The gnocchi was so light and fluffy. My pasta was homemade and not too rich. We struggled to finish our plates but saved room for dessert. The cheesecake is an absolute must have! With a few beers the meal (with tip) was around $100. Worth every penny! I would definitely recommend. We will be back again if ever in Baltimore.",

There wasn't the capability to make some for the entire group upstairs but they brought up plates from the main kitchen.

I ordered the Gamberi e Fagioli, which is grilled shrimp on a bean salad. While the two grilled shrimp were great, the dish is not worth it if you don't like beans. I also had the Tagliatelle al Ragu. It is their house-made tagliatelle pasta with their special ragu sauce with beef. It was a simple pasta dish, but I still enjoyed it.  Service was great. The server and other staff were really attentive.",

The grilled food tastes smoky and extremely flavorful and light.  They are health conscience so, there are a wide variety of vegitarian, vegan and gluten free meals. Germano and his wife and two lovely daughters are frequently present and helping to be sure things run smoothly and all guests are leaving happy.  This place is a real gem in Little Italy. The desserts are amazing and made there as well. Bongo bongo is 3 puff pasteries filled with vanilla cream and topped with melted Belgian chocolate.  The sweetest thing I discovered is that Germano is extremely particular about making the expresso drinks the authentic Itialian way, with the finest quality ground espresso beans available. Germanos has the old country Itialian charm and family atmosphere that we all hope for when stepping into this historic neighborhood. There is an intimate little Caberet upstairs that features some of the most talented Musicians in the area preforming each weekend. I simply loved the whole experience. I highly recommend it to all.",

My favorite simple starters are the grilled vegetables, beet salad, and sliced prosciutto, pecorino, & other selections from the charcuterie board. My friend got the red beet ravioli and it was out of this world. It's always special trying unique dishes. I ordered the grilled octopus which was perfectly tender and delectable. We also ordered the salmone, which was light and savory. At the end of our meal we had vanilla gelato with espresso and bongo bongo, cream filled profiteroles with chocolate drizzled on top. All in all, everything is 5 stars at Germano's, from the food to the waiters, to Germano Fabiani's hospitality himself.",
