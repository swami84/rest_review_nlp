I paid with my credit card and after about 90 minutes of waiting on my order to arrive I called the store only for them to tell me they have no order for me. They then contacted the online ordering department which is outsourced and was told that my card did not go through. I then checked my account and the transaction was pending. So I figured I would give it a few days to see if the pending charge drops off since I did not get any food. Fast forward a week later I checked my account and my card was charged for the order of which I did not receive. I contacted the store and spoke to the supervisor and was told that I had to contact their online order people of which, he, supervisor did not have their number after someone at the store told me last week that they contacted them to check on the order. So, I went online and got a toll free number and spoke with someone who then told me that I needed to contact the store again and get the credit card authorization department. At this point, I am frustrated because I believe instead of me getting the run around the store could have easily fixed this for me by contacting their people and telling them to refund my money. It got to be a headache so I decided it wasn't worth the money to continue getting the run around. I just know in the future I will not be using them or placing any other online orders from any other store. Keep in mind this review is not about the food because I never tasted it since I never got my order. It's simply about their online ordering process.",

It was dry no sauce a bunch of cheese and not even half way filled with fries and barely warm. The subs was cold for 8 dollars i got bread. I thought I would give them another try after months without ordering from them food use to be good, subs use to be stuff now they are empty. Will not make this mistake again. Order from them at your own risk. To many other places to order from where the food is still good and you dont have to wait 2.5 hours to get your food.",

Three years later, my boyfriend and I still talk about how delicious the food was here ( we moved across the country). I am shocked at all the negative reviews...isn't this supposed to be based on food and not service? Anyways, the food is unbeatable, and by far some of the best pizza, calzone, and stromboli (and don't even get be started on the desserts) I have ever had.  Give this place a try! You won't regret it!",

She was professional however you can here her coworkers very loudly laughing and talking in the background. That didnt bother me although unprofessional. What turned this experience on its head was the fact that the driver refused to get out his car to give me my food. Got smart about it and still expected a tip. He clearly lost his mind. Thank goodness for my neighbor who was sitting outside since i didnt have shoes on. I get my food and the pizza is lukewarm and so are my fries. And my wings were sssoooooo over done to the point they were hard and you couldn't bite through them. I called the store twice and was immediately put on hold to noone coming back.  Dont do it choose another place to djne",

They be like hello hold on, or never say hold on and start talking to other people while in the middle of you ordering, another time I got hung up on twice after asking to speak to a supervisor. I had to cancel my order because it took so long one time. And they delivery guy well lets just say i have no words for him. I work at a well prospective business and he had the nerve to want to check my I'D like I was a common credit card thief. However the food is good, but lack great customer service skills. They need to be train on how to deal with the public and learn to manage their horrible delivery time like the longest I waited for my food was a hour and a half if not longer",
