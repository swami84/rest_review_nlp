I can honestly, whole heartedly, confidently, say that this is THE BEST, food I have ever eaten in my life, and i love food, i came out of my mother eating and i have stopped stuffing my face for the past 21 years, and this is the absolute best food i have ever, ever had. If you live within a 100 mile radius of this place i would advise you to stop reading my review, go get your car keys, hop in your car and speed as fast as you can to this place. If I was on death row and had one more meal to eat it would be the fish tacos from here. I had to pinch myself multiple times, but no, i was not dreaming, this is heaven, and it\u2019s in Chicago. I don\u2019t care what you do in your life, it\u2019s your life. But dear god please, PLEASE, before you die. EAT. HERE.",

The menu is awesome and the Cuban Spiced Won Tons are the perfect start to your meal and the quesadilla is also a home run. All of the burgers are really well down with the right amount of creativity without being too much. They have a rotating list of cool martinis and they are delicious and always have plenty of booze.  The servers are great and the owner, Alex, is such a friendly and hard working guy.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Great patio for the summers also!",

Our waitress enlightened us to the Moscow Mule which is made with their home-made gingerbeer, this is a must try. They offer a great selection of burgers with a flavor for everyone (I had a spicy burger with ghost pepper cheddar and roasted habanero pepers, which was the perfect amount of kick). Burgers are served wirh pretzel buns which is a nice touch.  Overall, great little spot with a nice assortment of drinks, good food, a very friendly waitstaff, all at a good price. I wasnt planning to go to this restaurant initially, but was pleasanlty surprised by food and service. Check em out.",

        "caption": "Visiting this bar was a result of random walking.  A friend and I went here after we freeloaded the Borders near-by of their books and WiFi when it closed at midnight.  We were just walking until she pulled me into this bar.  We just wanted some time to talk since her apartment is possibly contaminated with the flu/cough spit/piggy aids.  This bar felt cool the minute we walked in.  It's your normal L-shaped bar with barstool tables and some couch space.  The music was not too loud, the waitress was very attentive and bingo! - Connect Four!  They had a a couple games to play with in the back and we were playing Connect Four like it was our job.  I got beat in every game, but who cares - imported beer was $5 a glass.  When we got our check - we were expecting $20.  Nope! $10!  We stumbled in on a half price night!  All drinks are half-price on Thursdays!",
