The only thing we didn\u2019t like were the Rosemary Mashed Potatoes because there was wayyyy too much rosemary and it was the only thing we could taste. The Mac and Cheeses were decent but the Buffalo Mac was our fav! Overall there was a great selection to choose from and we\u2019d definitely order again!!",

The burger was a blend of beyond meats seasoned well covered in a tangy sauce and small dills. It was delicious. I was not a fan of the macaroni and cheese, but the cheesy homies were very tasty.  There was a misunderstanding due to the menu on the app Doordash and I had previously left a 3 star review based mainly on frustration about the clarity of the menu. After some very good communication with Samantha I deleted my prior review. I think 4.5 stars would be appropriate. Given that I can either choose 4 or 5, I chose 5 because of the earnest communication and the care in preparation. Just because my taste buds do not align with one of the sides is not reason enough to dip to 4. I recommend and will continue to explore their menu.",

However, from the couple of times that I have been to Dixie Dharma in Armature Works, it\u2019s so inconsistent. Honestly, it\u2019s a 50/50 chance whether it\u2019ll be good or be bad. We kept tryna give it the benefit of the doubt but it\u2019s been bad to the point we no longer go there. We\u2019ve been so disappointed that whats the point even going anymore if in total for the both of us we spend 30 each time and it\u2019s just bad every single time? The one time it was good was from an employee who had great customer service, was very kind, helped us, answered all our questions, gave us samples, had a great energy, and the food came out nice and hot with lots of flavor. Ever since then it\u2019s always been different people. Of course everyone has different times and different shifts but the food has never compared to that one guy during that day. Now? The food has come out bland, not always hot, just not good. I always ended up getting the same meal every single time I went because what\u2019s the point of venturing around the menu when its become more of a 20% chance that I\u2019ll be good. Cute place, yes it\u2019s vegan, but no I\u2019ve been disappointed one to manny times to go back. I\u2019d rather travel to Dixie Dharma, Market On South all day instead of the one in Tampa.",

Being a plant based eater(sometimes a lacto veg) for over 22 years i know that what vegan (and many vegetarian)eateries don't get right is seasoning , knowing what actually tastes good and what is ..good hearty food .

We had difficulty choosing between the barbeque sandwich or the chili dogs. Next time we are there, we're definitely going to try them.  Oh, and after we ordered we wandered around a little bit. She offered to text us when our meal was ready! That was an unexpected perk for us so we wouldn't have to just stand there waiting for the food. I highly recommend this place.",

These are the FINE VITTLES u are lookin' for. I use to drive to Orlando just to eat here! I have eaten everything on the menu and nothing dissapoints!  I even get excited about that salad and everyone knows you don't win friends with salad. Buffalo mac is a dream come true, so are the biscuits and gravy! The grits are the best too. It is a great time to be alive! Thx Dixie Dharma :)",
