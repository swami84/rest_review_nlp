I always feel great after having thier juices, which they make fresh, to order right in front of you. Want something not on the menu? Just tell them and they'll make it! Additions are no extra charge!  They also have a 3 day juice cleanse that I just participated in. The cleanse consists of 5 juices and 1 Yogi brand detox tea each day. They also give you a little bag of peanuts in case you can't make it through without something solid. Peanuts are a poor choice though for a detox... I didnt eat them.",
