We had asked him for another bottle of wine, before realizing we still had some left and he said he would keep an eye on it and as soon as we finished the first one, another one quickly appeared without us having to ask! Then, my friend had the wings and some sauce splattered on her shirt, and without even having to ask, the bartender, Alex, came out with some club soda and a napkin to clean it up. The service would have been enough to want to come back, but the food was also delicious (wings, oysters, and garlic fries! YUM) and the ambiance was also great (love their rooftop patio!).

It has a butcher shop up front but around the corner is a cozy seating area on one side and a bar on the other and an event center at the back. A lot going on! The burgers were fabulous, the beer cold, service very good and the price reasonable. I was just sorry we didn't get back there before we left.",

Simply order one of their burgers without the bun or the chimichurri steak with a side salad. The quality of the meat is phenomenal - fresh and well-seasoned! If you're not keto, their mashed potatoes are the BEST in the biz - highly recommend! Also, get a margarita from this place - delicious and STRONG! I'll definitely be back! :-)",

I rarely leave bad reviews but after seeing the extra charge on my credit card, I thought I\u2019d take the time to share my thoughts.  The burger was pretty awful too, however... one best part of the food was the short rib pasta, that was good enough to bring this review up to 1 star.",

Super friendly staff that will readily hook you up with a flyer from the show, I watched the owner comp a guy who simply asked how much it was, and she put him on the list, cuz she felt like giving. I usually meet whomever I go to see if I politely stick around after, and this venue books a lot of great bands. It is a real butcher shop that normally closes around 10 PM I am told here on Google, as it also is a restaurant/bar. It has an amazing bathroom and handwashing station separate from each other. I love this place, and have since I first came here. I have never had an issue, and I have seen them deal with issues swiftly, safely, and fair to the people causing the issues. I rarely see anyone ejected if they comply to the fair staff suggestions. Parking is 7 days a week in this area, as a heads up. I find parking easy and cheap enough if you arrive early, which I always recommend one do. Come early, check out ALL THE BANDS! OPENERS OFTEN SLAY A CLOSER, JUST STATING FACTS!!!",

I walked in and met a woman at the counter that mentioned they had a full dine in experience and as I looked past her I could see a very enticing bar. As I walked back to the bar to get a drink I noticed a huge stage in the back in which they were preparing for a performance. It was surprise after surprise walking into this place. And in a great way. As I sat down at the bar Alex the Bartender continued to surprise me by going above and beyond. The cocktail was Amazing but then he gave me a tour of the space and invited me to stay for the show they were preparing for. Honestly this place shocked and amazed me the whole way through. I appreciate these types of businesses that continue to think outside the box and offer an experience that is authentic and unique. My highest praises for my experience at the Chop shop.",

The French toast with blueberries and pistachio was so sweet and rich! But I especially liked the sausage sandwich. The biscuit had a perfect crumble to it and bacon baked in.

If you are a fan of dimly lit, warm and cozy dining settings, this is really nice. It\u2019s modest but well-kept and there is a nice, ongoing, soft murmur from people around you. We wanted to try different appetizers and share so we went with the Signature Butcher\u2019s Board \u2013 chef\u2019s choice. It was a nice assortment of cheeses, salamis and some jams and aioli to compliment the meats and cheeses. We later got another board with the ones we liked most (lamb slices were the absolute best, in my opinion). Then we did the East & West Coast Oysters (good, but a bit raw for my taste), and the Steak Tartare (super tender and melts in your mouth with an aioli sauce). I\u2019m a huge fan of hard cider so I tried all of theirs (Seattle being the best). Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or casual to semi casual occasion. They have another section of the restaurant and place where there\u2019s live music (we didn\u2019t get to make that.) And the staff is extremely warm and amiable. Headed back sometime soon!",
