Ordered two bottle drinks and they were left off for some unknown reason and pretty much told \"call if I had a problem with it\". Probably won't order from there again. *Update* November 10, 2020. So I gave this place a second chance. Ordered a cheese 14 inch. Probably the nastiness of the nast. Cheese was bitter, no sauce hardly and food arrived cold. Not their fault about cold, but the taste is. Never eating here again. Frozen pizza is better.",

No prob, walked over to pick it up 25 min later, not ready, all good, a few min later check with register, said they have my order it's coming out. 20 min later, check with front again and retell them my order,  said they have it coming. 20 min later I'm told they're out of dough, then I'm told they have enough for my large, I told them I'd take whatever at that point. 20 minutes later pizza comes out, low level pizza. I would hit Dominos over this place 10 times out of 10 for convenience and honestly the pizza wouldn't be far off, in fact I may have preferred it. Altogether took about an hour and a half from me calling in my order to leaving with a pizza. I would find some different options for late night food and will be avoiding this my next trip here. Hope you guys figure it out.",

I get to the restaurant and the total came out to waayyyy more than they said and I thought. So prices are different on their menu. I got a Italian hot sandwich and a chicken  already.  The cashier (a guy) told me each is 12 dollars. Then a SERVICE FEE of 3%. What hotel is this because from what I see it is a take out restaurant on the corner of a block. He stated to me the service fee is tax. Wrong, buddy. I know what a service fee is working a a service for many years. Be straight up and disclose the prices and fees before anything.  I felt very Car Dealer vibes at this establishment. It was 12:15am. He stated after 12am they don't accept cash, only card. WARNING!!! AFTER 12AM ONLY CARD, NO CASH. I'm sure it was all B.S. He probably over charged and will change receipt to reflect correct amount and pocket the rest as tip. Very shady vibes I got from this place. I won't ever return here next time I visit New Orleans. Food was okay. They criticized my request for mayo. Leave me alone, bruh. A warning to fellow travelers.",

After a half hour of waiting, past the time that it was supposed to be ready, I finally understood that they weren't going to cook a half muffuletta that takes 6 min to cook and prep a pasta dish, after they gave our order to the wrong ppl.

I called the store to follow up and they informed me that Uber would be delivering the food. I informed them of what the uber eats app relayed to me and was directed to the manager. She first said the same thing I was initially told. When I explained to her that the app stated the store would be taking care of the order she then stated that the food was on its way. After 30 minutes I checked back with the store and the young woman who answered said she would call the driver and check on the order and then call me back. She called back from a different number than the one listed as the business line and said that I should call uber because she does not know where the driver is and they don't deliver food. I referred again to the fact that the app has only given me a message stating that the store would deliver the food and I would not be able to track a driver. The young lady then put me on hold and left me on hold without returning. I disconnected and attempted to call the store twice and there was no answer. Then called the other number and the manager answered aggitated saying that there was nothing she could do. I then proceeded to ask her for the contact information of the driver that they had on my ticket and she said she did not have any info and that the younglady was new. I recited to her what the young lady said about having the drivers' contact info and it became a yelling match where she disconnected the call. The service here is horrible. Apparently their ordering system on the app is faulty and leaves customers misinformed and left with bad attitude and incompetence to make up for it. I will never forget this experience and the behavior exhibited was unbecoming of management.",

So hot I cant even eat it yet (did steal a bite..or 2) so decided to write this review while I wait to eat. Order was made exactly how I placed it which oh btw..I must say is a lot of food for one person to eat. The garlic bread...where do I begin...omg..so good..but garlic bread I think not.

The Muffeletta side had 3-4 small pieces of olives and gardinera and looked like it they just poured the oil all over it.  You would think that with not being that busy they would at least get the order right/not skimp out... very disappointing.  I ended up tossing the pizza because iit was just greasy and dry.  Your best bet would be to go somewhere else as most business around are grateful for any customers right now.  Its a shame because they have a diverse menu which is what drew me in.

My only complaint is that I have ordered from ya'll 8 times, and mostly I am ordering the same salad or a the same pizza via the menu. However, they have never been the same. I have  had one pizza 6 times. It is suprising how differently it can be made. The salad is worse for the variance. I wish I could ask which employee made my favorite, and then ask for that employees version again. All or most of the ingredients are usually there, but in drastically different measures.",

I had to call finally to get the man to deliver. I should have read the reviews first. I would never order here again unless I'm sitting in to eat.

When I called and asked to speak with a manager the man on the line went to the person who made the order and told them they had a complaint and as I could hear the conversation they made me feel like I was wrong for having a problem so I just hung up. This was disapointing because I have never had any issue and the I don't care attitude was just enough for me to say I can spend $11.53 somewhere else.",

We ordered food threw post mates and all they could is blame the delivery service they pay for to messing up our order. Spent over $110 worth of food and an hour later get only about $45 worth of food.  I call them back and they say i only order 2 pastas and a pizza for $110. Yeah rite. Lol. Its not even worth spending or eatting there. Not all that great. If the owner whould read this he should fire his whole crew and start fresh if i where him.",

It\u2019s different than the actual menu in the restaurant (both prices and selections). Second off, they are incredibly slow. I was the only diner at 1100am on a Wednesday and it still took 18 minutes to get a sandwich.  It is definitely overpriced, which is why I opted for the sandwich. The portion size was quite large but the bread didn\u2019t taste fresh and the meatballs were so small.  The menu says sandwiches are served with kettle cooked chips but it should say served crushed Lay\u2019s potato chips.  I don\u2019t recommend.",

I explained this to the parking lot company and was told that this happens often. So I fought my boot ticket with the company and was able to receive the refund entirely. I also talk to the management of Italian Pie and the gentlemen was extremely unhelpful and said we don\u2019t do anything. I explained that your employees were caught parking in customers spots. I was passing by a month later and noticed that they changed signs and ensure that people will not get booted and customers parking is for customers, but at that point they lost a customer.",

Not a single customer was eating in. However we saw locals coming in and ordering takeout, (not eating in), so we figured the food must be good. It isn't. It took an unapologetic 55 minutes to make our margherita pizza, and it tastes exactly like a frozen pizza from walmart. Tasteless, light on the sauce, tough crust. Not to overcriticize, but they didn't even cut the pizza fully, and they don't have silverware, only plastic forks and knives.  I have no idea how anyone rates this place above a 2, but there is a \"under new management\" sign, so maybe that is the problem. The place truly smells like garbage.",
