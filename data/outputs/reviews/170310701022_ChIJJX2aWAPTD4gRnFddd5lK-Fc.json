I have been to many other places in Chicago that claimed that their Doner will taste exactly like the one in Germany but it was always a fail! Randomly one night I had a Doner craving and decided to drive to this Gem. The moment I walked in, I knew I was not going to be disappointed. I mean I was able to smell it and on top of everything the owners are German/Turkisch!  I am BIG into customer service and the owners of Ali Baba did not disappoint. We sat reminiscing about Germany and had amazing laughs! Their hospitality was beyond welcoming and the Doner was to die for! You can tell by the way they prepared the Doner that they take pride in what they do! All the ingredients were fresh and the meat was seasoned to perfection! There is not much more that I can say BUT seriously do yourself a favor, stop in and try one! You will thank me forever!",

The kicker: He makes cevaps with all the fixings, including a lepinja.  The reason of my shoutout...he's a good guy, the food is very reasonably priced and hits the spot each time.

Turkish tea served for free which was a great gesture.  I recommend the don\u00ebr sandwich and recommend ordering it spicy (it\u2019s not too much heat), extra meat and extra garlic sauce to make it feel like you\u2019re in Europe !!

They were very conversational and seem to really enjoy serving people amazing food.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  One interesting aspect was watching the owners assemble the food.  Through the glass panel I watched him meticulously layer each ingredient into the my sandwich; I was entranced.  He genuinely wanted the food to look as good as it tasted, and because he put the time into making it presentable - I think it really adds to the experience.  I will definitely be coming back.  The fries are an absolute must-try; some of the freshest I've had in a very long time. (No photo because I ate them too fast)  Fun fact: they speak English, Turkish and German!",

The owners are super friendly and welcoming, and the doner was really tasty! There are a couple couches/benches to eat at inside but I think it will primarily be a takeout spot. Wishing them good luck, especially after all of the relatively recent business closures on this strip!",
