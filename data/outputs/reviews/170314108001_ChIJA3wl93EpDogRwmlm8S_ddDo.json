Honestly, I could come back for the juices alone,  especially the watermelon fresca. As a meat eater and barbecue enthusiast I had to try the brisket burger. While it wouldn't win any smokehouse awards, it was a good sandwich and very enjoyable. The seasoned fries were also good. I did think it was a bit overpriced for what I got, but it was about what you'd expect for a trendy niche restaurant. I'll definitely be back.",

Given the price, and hassle of parking in the city when passing through - I was disappointed that the food wasn't better.

I even had to wait on food while some was ready so that meant my other food was getting cold. The last time they didn't put my seasoned fries in the bag. When I called to let them know they didn't apologize.  The last time I was there with a friend we both ordered the Bistro Burger, the cauliflower and the nachos w/o jalapenos. They served us the burgers first and the buns were STONE COLD!  I've noticed they have new employees but that really is no excuse.  I suppose I'll have to vote with my dollars and go elsewhere.

I had to call for a third time to finally place an order.  I ordered buffalo wings, Baja tacos, and a meatball sub. The meatball sub was really good, very well seasoned maybe a little on the oily side. The baja tacos weren't very good. I took one bite and threw them away, they were very bland, just tasted like a piece of tempeh with some coleslaw tossed on top and the tortilla tasted like it was stale and falling apart. The buffalo wings were good but definitely should be eaten in.  Definitely won't be coming back anytime soon.",

The vegetables were not fresh, instead they were frozen bagged veggies. My husband's Korean BBQ bowl was also inedible.

To her surprise she learned that many other of the entrees were not available as well and this was 6pm on a Sunday (in a store that operates 11am to 10pm schedule. The dish she ordered to replace her first was the Buddha Bowl. Which came out like someone couldn't follow the cooking and arrangement instructions.  The sweet potatoes were poorly chopped. They were also missing the teriyaki sauce which was placed on the mushrooms.  The bowl had emanated a sour aroma in its take-out container (we ordered to-go). Which it is quite possible it was coming from the sweet potatoes since my wife choose to not eat them.  Also, the blondie brownie I ordered had been sitting for too long and became dry. I'm not sure if their deserts are refrigerated or rotated properly when on display like ALL OTHER LOCATIONS.  Also, on the same day from another visitor that is family the vegetables he had for his Soul bowl went uncooked. Seriously how does a fry cook not be able to tell when vegetables are cooked when the easiest indicator is its texture and color?  Nevertheless this was strike out number 5 when it comes to dining AT THIS LOCATION.  There's 4 other incidents that I didn't feel like I need to voice any concern. Yet, since this is consistently happening over the span of the year it seems like I will need to elaborate on every incident I have which is just about every visit. It feels like Native Foods is paying people to sabotage their own restaurant and brand.  I will be voicing my concern on social media and contacting NF directly.  - HOW DOES SOMEONE NOT KNOW HOW TO CHOP SWEET POTATOES - HOW DOES THE WEEKEND CREW NOT KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE OR MAKE A CALL WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF INGREDIENTS. - WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO COOK MEALS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MANY PATRONS IN THE RESTAURANT OR A LOW VOLUME OF ONLINE ORDERS.  Just sit down at Majani's and watch how they work. SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED.",

Then every 100 points you get $5/off. You can also order from the app so it will be ready (takeout or dine in) and they do delivery through a few services.  Second, the food is superb, even my carnivore family loves eating here! My favorite is the lemongrass broccoli, it\u2019s addicting and I never have liked broccoli. My mom likes the vegan fried chicken wings, they are strips really, but seasoned very well. The cupcakes are yummy too, I love the caramel carrot cake  cupcake. For drinks you can\u2019t go wrong with the lavender lemonade but they have other flavored fresh teas and kombucha bottles too.  Third, location is great. Right down the street from Harper Theater so perfect for before/after movie dining and you can use the Harper parking garage on 53rd to access it immediately. They also have 15 minute parking on the street for quick take away.  Last (but maybe this should be first) it\u2019s all GMO free, plant-based, chef crafted (even their meat replacements!) goodness!  The menu is huge, have fun trying everything- you can\u2019t go wrong! My new favorite is the bulgogi bowl.",

Furthermore they didn't put avocado on my Chicken bacon avo sandwich really people its in the name. I tried calling and of course they were closed. I came in the store the next day and spoke to a manager who refused to remake the order. She requested the receipt which I provided then said the food was not inedible it was just missing certain items. Then she said I should have taken a photo or called yesterday because she was not there. She did not replace my order or take any responsibility yet I paid full price for scrape food that they threw together because they knew they were closing and I couldn't return. The manager even made it seem as if it was my fault for not being able to contact the restaurant when they were closed. If you order anything it should come with everything you are supposed to get especially if you are charged extra. Worst service ever I will never eat at this store again.",

It was busy , but I quietly made my way to the front and was met by Marquies Haynes the General Manager who observed the one bite from half the sandwich and heard my explanation about how the sauce flavor was overwhelming; Mr. Haynes looked at me and said,\" I can see if it was something we did, but yea we can't exchange it for anything.\" I was disappointed, but in shock that he offered no concessions and basically smerked as I walked away per the observation of dinner party. I slide the sandwich back to Mr. Marquies Haynes and said, \" I do not like to toss food, so can you toss that,\" Mr. Haynes said ok.  It is about quality customer service and this General Manager had no customer service skills. I am always at Native Foods, but maybe it is time for a break!  Thanks for reading!",

The food is delicious but the service here is less than acceptable. The cashier today gave pretty good service. The gentleman checking the lobby and giving guest their food was terrible. The kitchen staff was okay i suppose. The experience was fine until i noticed after 30 minutes of waiting i didn't receive my nachos. Nor was i checked on by the lobby person at all. I'm not sure if they take the numbered displays off your table when you recieve your order but doing that would've helped very much with the lobby employee knowing if all was well or not. I arrived at 12:06 and when i noticed i was still waiting i got up to inform the cashier of my dilemma. She wasn't extremely apologetic but i appreciated her solution oriented attitude and offered to remake my nachos. I said sure. I was still pretty hungry and so when she asked if i wanted to keep the original order i said sure but 10 mintues later i still hadn't recieved the new order either. I couldn't wait anymore and just counted my loses but i realized i was a bit disappointed with the experience. It was below even mediocre. I wasn't treated like someone whose business was improtant. For that i won't be back to this location for a while. Much luck to everyone there nonetheless.",
