Upon being seated we were told that there was a 3:45 party after us so we had to be done by that time. So now it's about 2pm its takes a  additional 10 to 15 minutes after being seated to order our appetizers.  Then an additional 15 to 20 minutes for the appetizers  to arrive.  The place is now packed so getting our entree is slow. We don't get our entree until 3ish at this point we can't finish eating so we are handed to go plates.  The brunch came with dessert which we paid for but never received.  Evo requires that you put down a deposit down which isnt refundable so as not to lose it we decided to stay.  Overall a poor experience if I could give them a zero rating I would.  The place doesn't look as nice as  on their website.  We were rushed and spent over $400 at this place because brunch is $35 per person including gratuity we had a party of 12. Lots of time you want to support local business so you go these places but they offer poor service.  Don't believe we would had been treated this poorly in the city. Our server was nice.  Update 1/26 to the owner.  You are not accommodating me when I've paid for a service. IT WAS YOUR JOB TO PROVIDE FOR A PAID SERVICE.   An accommodation would have been returning the deposit or maybe comping part of the meal. SIR/MADAM OWNER YOU should have have thankful for us staying because your next reservation was at 3:45pm. Also you didn't \"except \" our reservation you \"accepted\".  Please look up the difference between the two words. LESSON LEARNED.  #BASURA #GARBAGE",

Its usually slow in the lounge around this time so if you're looking for a space for you and/or friend(s) to have drinks and apps without a huge crowd of people this is the perfect time and place for you.  The apps and regular drinks (like Martinis, Margaritas etc) are only $5 dollars and I'm in LOVE. Our bartender last week Thursday (4/4) named Corey made this tasty strawberry-mango margarita for me and this Black Label whiskey sour for my fiance and it was everything! He was very attentive and always checked on us to make sure we were alright despite the fact that they had other responsibilities to take care of. My favorite happy hour apps are the chicken nachos and the sweet chili wings.  There are two bartenders that will (more than likely) be there during this time; Corey and Delissa! Shes so sweet, efficient, her makeup is always on point (lol), she smiles alot and always makes sure we're taken care of. Both of these two has made my experience at Evo exceptional.  Love the decor and spacious bar and dining area.  Would 10/10 reccomend this place.",

We enjoyed ourself except for a few issues with the food..my mom ordered the bbq chicken,when she got it it was cold,they took it back and brung back hot,but she did not like the flavoring,she did like the hot wings appetizer. A few of my cousins ordered the salmon but they didnt eat it because it wasnt seasoned well.Me and a few of my other cousins ordered the steak and eggs and we had no complaints,it was very good.We loved the brunch drinks and even though it was very busy the waiter did his best to accommodate us even though we probably drove him crazy..lol...all in all it's a good brunch spot to turn up at.",

I Was there this past Saturday for my best friends birthday celebration and let me tell you! we got there a little before 11 and received our paid for bottles at 1 am!!!!!! Completely dry mouth for two hours!!!! Place was overly packed beyond capacity to the point where it was a hazard! Literally no space to get to the bar, bathroom or even dance!!! By 1:30 we took our things and left. If something were to go down in this place many people would be hurt. They definitely violate the capacity limit! This is straight up the most unorganized, unprofessional venue I have ever been too. Do not I repeat do not even think about coming to this place it\u2019s a huge hazard And disappointment. Do not waste your time and hard earned money here! Very distasteful place! Needs new management ASAP",

The drinks are not prepared correctly, they are either bitter or too strong- and over-priced! ts not conducive to an  after work crowd.  They expect you to stand up at a table that you literally have to pay for - no good.  Not the place to go to after a long day/ work week.  The bathrooms are poorly kept and not monitored for slip hazards-. The bar is sticky and dirty so are the floors.  It would make sense to schedule the staff to come in early to mop the entire floor with CLEAN MOP WATER-  and disinfect all tables and the bar -  the food smelled and looked delicious but my group was reluctant to order for fear that the kitchen is poorly kept as well.

All of the workers there had attitudes  except for the bouncer outside. There was only a sign that said NO REFUND FOR THE COAT FEE O N L Y. Upstairs was no sign or awareness that there would be no refund for the entrance fee..This was explained to the manager and he got very offensive cause he know that was wrong and walked away, so a ugly hood rat with a scarf pon her head came out arguing that a picture was taken so \u201cit\u201d started cursing and very much pressed, so cool they could keep the $13  because they need every dime to upgrade that establishment from junk..they wasn\u2019t even trying to give us our coats back at first.But, overall this place was Very ghetto and unprofessional with a dirty setting please don\u2019t waste your money or time here they don\u2019t like nor care for African American People but they\u2019re Hispanic so you know they lack knowledge because they are included within minority population unfortunately but YOUR WELCOME . #NewManagementAndWorkersNeededASAP #ThrowTheWholeBusinessAway #LeaveYaAttitudeHomeBabyyyyyBigUpYaself",

The same girl came back ten min later and asked us if we were sure and what girl took our card and what was the name on the \u201ctab\u201d . At that point I looked for the girl and pointed her out.

I decided to sit at one of the tables and was told they were reserved. After getting into a verbal altercation with security; about the seatingbarrangemebt, I was asked to leave. I have been to several, clubs, lounges and after our spots and I have never had my seat taken away and asked to stand before today.

We attended their $35 per person Sunday brunch. we were the first party there but It took them 15 minutes to tend to us. They offered all you can drink sangria for 2 hours, they gave us the sangria but took 40 minutes to bring us glasses. The server kept forgetting our orders as others came, were served 3 courses and left before we got appetizers. Then she mixed up the orders for all three courses. Our food was trickled in so we didn't get to eat together  The owner only offered to remove the cost of 2 meals and he put $15.00 cash in the check book for gratuity (He didn't even come over to apologize). We took our desserts to go. We asked for 1 slice chocolate cake and 1 slice of cheese cake. We open it the next day to find 2 slices of chocolate cake. Needless to say I will never go there again nor recommend to anyone. The one good thing was a Dj named 7 One 8. He was the only reason the place was tolerable.",

        "caption": "Came in early to see what the spot was like and at 830ish it's chill as hell. The bartender whose name I unfortunately didn't get was an absolute gentleman (Latin cat with black bull style nose ring). However, returned later that same night at around 1am expecting to turn up with a crowd, and the experience was a complete 180. Bouncers weren't at the door so we had to welcome ourselves passed their (completely unnecessary) velvet ropes and welcome ourselves into the spot. We met a disgruntled male bouncer who looked like he couldn't bag a chick if his mom's life was on the line and a couple of studs who looked like they eat tuna fish out the can at Thanksgiving. They immediately made us step outside for an ID check (cool) and pat down (cool also). Noticeably upset that we walked in, the bouncer says I couldn't enter because I had my vaporizer on me. Simply telling me I couldn't use the thing would have been fine (as I had planned to purchase a hookah anyway) but denying me entry was completely hate felt and lame as all hell. I refused and spent my money at a better establishment. Much respect to the bartender I met earlier in the night, piss on the bouncers and owner(s) of this glorified sweat box.",

The younger group just don't know how to act most of the time. This is like a major problem waiting to happen. First the young ladies dress with too much to show and then don't want attention. I see it as, when you dress the part, people will treat you that way. If you want respect, respect yourself first ladies. Men also need to be more respectful as well. At times these young ladies can be their daughters. Anyway, I won't be back again unless it's early for brunch time. If you check the reviews on here, you get more likes for the lower ratings and no like for the higher ones. That says a lot that people know this place is not all that great.",
