We shared the fresh burrata & citrus beets to start, which were fantastic! Loved the citrus bits and as a collective bite, each ingredient complimented each other so well! For entrees, I did the Monkey's Paw Burger ~ two patties, american cheese, balsamic onions, butter pickles, aoili and served with a side of fries. Excellent. I'm becoming more convinced Chicago should be known for their burgers. My wife had the braised pork ragu which was yummy as well from the few bites I stole.  On some other visits, I've also tried the shishito peppers, brussel sprouts, fish & chips, and a seasonal chicken piccata. Anyways, nothing but praise for this one. They do take reservations if you're looking to lock something down. It actually makes for a nice, low key date night spot.  'Til next time!",

The wooden decor added to the atmosphere as I sat down to one of the tastiest meals I've ever had from the inventive chef's menu. For example The chef's has reinvented meatballs. Something I didn't think I'd care about until I tasted them, they in particular are like no other and stupendous. This is indicative of the food menu both classic and new tastes to enjoy. There are only a few TV screen's. So that neon light doesn't bathe the bar during any given game that must be watched and the sound is lower so you can still have a conversation. I have had many a good conversation with both staff and clientele alike.",

My friend and I were both blown away by the food and the drinks as were the two people sitting at the table next to us. Chef Rah throws down in the kitchen like no one I know. And what's so amazing is he is still so young. If I weren't in public and if I weren't a lady I promise I would have licked my plate clean. That's how good Rah's food tastes.  My friend and I started out with the Bloody Mary which was by far also one of the absolute BEST Bloody Mary's I've ever tasted! It was incredible. Everything about the drink was perfection - the garnish, the amazing bacony rim (did I mention I really don't eat meat but oh so good), and most especially the actual drink itself (base and mix). I could've easily downed a few of these babies... that good. Though I was also intrigued by their whiskey flight which I am going to have to enjoy on my next visit. Yes, there will definitely be a next visit.  For the food, my friend ordered the Rah's Skillet which was beyond delicious. I had my heart set on Ashely's Morning Fix but unfortunately the bread guy never showed that was not an option. I will have it on my return visit. I ended up going with the shrimp and grits.  I had my heart set on getting a side of grits anyways because the menu calls them Chef Rah's special grits and this girl lived in Georgia for a few years where I eventually fell in love with cheesy good grits and have had a really hard time finding here in Chicago. Oh man, Rah's grits are out of this world AMAZING!!!! And the rest of the dish was just as incredibly delicious..... and let me mention there is meat in there. I had to do it.... I didn't want to upset the chef and ask him to prepare his dish differently as it is quite obvious this man knows his way around the kitchen and pairs certain ingredients together for a reason.  Let me just say that if meat tasted that good ALL the time, I'd probably eat it regularly. Everything about Monkey's Paw was amazing and it certainly didn't hurt that chef Rah visited our table to say hi and see how everything was. Both my friend and I cannot wait to return and from posting a few pics from our brunch we have more friends that will be joining us when we do. Trust me, you NEED to put Monkey's Paw on your brunch list and from what I hear dinner is just as amazing.  Chef Rah - You've got a new fan!",

We wanted to try the special flatbread with pulled pork and BBQ sauce. I think the table really enjoyed this. The sauce was tangy and slightly spicy the pork was tender and not overly seasoned. I went for the burger with a side of Poutine fries. You don\u2019t see Poutine much in the states unless you go to Canada so I had to order it.  The Gnocchi was another dish ordered. It was light and fluffy and didn't feel heavy.  We really enjoyed the food and service here. Actually, I can certainly get use to service like this compared to NYC.",

There wasn't a wait for a table, but by 7 the restaurant had filled out nicely.  There is a great menu for craft beers, great wine selection, and spirits as well.  Draft beer selection included beers from Wisconsin, Michigan (Greenbush) and Chicago master brewers.  We had a cheese plate (3 choices for $11) and it came with house parmigiana cracker-bread.  All cheese choices were greeted by, \"Oh, wow that's good.\"  We also ordered the olives.  Not as warm as we would have liked, but great choices of olives in a single serving jar with lid (presentation only).  Both appetizers were great and were nicely paired with our drinks.  For dinner we shared the fish-n-chips.  With a house-made batter, it was light and crispy and cooked perfectly.  It was reasonably priced, $12 for two pieces that were fair-sized.  The desserts offered were great as well, there was an assortment, but we chose only one to share: cherry-infused chocolate mousse.  It was very light and not overly sweet.  The atmosphere was relaxed, a place like this in NYC would have had twice as many tables and packed to the gills, but offered the same food.  Service was fast and friendly-joking with me as we complimented the menu.  We will be back soon as there is no other place like it in the neighborhood.  (One might argue that 404 Wine Bar could be similar, yes, but they don't meet the food quality and excellent service that the Monkey's Paw has to offer.)  Keep it up Monkey's Paw!",

        "caption": "Right near DePaul and Lincoln Park, The Monkey's Paw is an awesome new place which seems like they've been a local establishment for years.  With rotating taps featuring local and favorite brews, you will discover a new beer for whatever your palette loves.  Have I mentioned the wall of scotches?  Yes, they have a wall stocked of a very impressive collection and assortment of scotches.  Not a beer or scotch fan?  They've got wine to please anyone's fancy.  Can't decide what to drink?  That's OK, they do flights as well.  And the Food!  If you're not the imbibing type, come and enjoy the diverse and delicious menu, crafted by a master chef.  A dish can be had by anyone and accomodate any allergies you may or may not have.  The staff is friendly and treat you like a human being.  Everyone knows what they're talking about and the staff in the back works harder than elves on Christmas Eve.  To show your appreciation for your savory meal, you can opt to buy a 6-pack for the kitchen staff (to enjoy after hours, of course)!  I could go on and on about this place, but I'll shut up and let you decide for yourself.  If you go and are not pleased, please feel free to write me and tell me why you respectfully disagree.  Enjoy.",
