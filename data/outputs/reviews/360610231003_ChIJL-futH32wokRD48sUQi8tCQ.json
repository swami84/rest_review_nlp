Tonight my food got here and hour and 15 min after I ordered to ad insult to injury it was all ice cold ! The Chicken wings that I asked for extra crispy were soft and had feathers and the French fries that I ask to be made fresh and crispy were brown and soggy , let\u2019s not forget the 2 Egg Rolls that I ordered were dripping oil through the bag ! When I took them out the were soft and Super shinny cuz of the drenching oil (Not Eatable) . Take my advice and DO NOT ORDER FEO THIS PLACE AFTER 6PM they just don\u2019t care about the quality of the food they send out after that time . Trust me don\u2019t do it to yourself !! #notahappycamper",

The broccoli was fresh, although was a tad overcooked for my taste, but I like very crisp broccoli. The egg rolls were homemade instead of the usual mass-produced egg roll at most Chinese takeout. Overall pretty good. I took off one star because the delivery guy didn't have enogh change (i gave him a 20 for an $11 meal. He only had 5 singles), and the rice in my fried rice was slightly UNDER-COOKED. The \"fried sweet donut\" is really good (from a prior order). It's basically cheap can store biscuits deep fried and rolled in sugar, but OH SOOOO GOOD :-D  I would DEFINITELY order from here again.",

The pork and shrimp egg rolls tasted as though they had been dipped in the fryer one too many times and they didn't come with the spicy mustard (which we didn't request and obviously should have). The vegetable fried rice was the tastiest part of our meal. Had a great flavor but not too salty. The general tso's chicken and sesame chicken were the main courses and we requested white meat only. Wow were they both disappointments. The sesame sauce was tangy, sweet, the way it should be; but what it covered was mainly breading followed by the tiniest bit of the white meat chicken. That is also how the generals was prepared and served as well. I guess my quest for finding good Chinese food will continue.",
