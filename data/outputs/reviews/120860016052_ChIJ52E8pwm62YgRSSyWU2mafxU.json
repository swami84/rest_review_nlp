        "caption": "A hidden little cafeter\u00eda in Downtown Hialeah, I decided to grab a bite for breakfast while waiting in line for my daughter's passport application turn at the post office down the block. The cafeter\u00eda is located inside the bodega, and there's also a typical Cuban style take out window. I went in and was immediately greeted by the main clerk and then the owner. They don't have menus, but I wasn't surprised since this is pretty much a mom and pop operation. I asked for the typical Cuban breakfast, which was scrambled eggs with ham & Munster cheese, and they added tomatoes, peppers, and onions for me, a tostada, and a caf\u00e9 con leche. Everything was absolutely fresh and delicious! The kitchen is spotless; they have a typical sandwich stand with the plexiglass front, so I could see everything going on in the kitchen. On the way out, the owner invited me back, politely letting me know what they were serving for lunch.  Price was a bargain! Service was friendly, and the food was delicious. I'm definitely going back!",
