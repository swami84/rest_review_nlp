So, the surprise was; The biryani had no vegetables with 2 cubes of \u2018panner\u2019 which were lost in rice, and half a string of broccoli which looked so sad that I felt sorry for it. . Yes, of course it's on discount because it's a hoax. Laccha paratha was replaced with oiled roti bread, and the side that came with it was disgustingly spicy. My fellow American, there is a difference between chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. If you\u2019re getting chunks of grilled chicken in \u2018tikka Marsala\u2019 it\u2019s a cheat (especially if it\u2019s colored pink or reddish). Laccha paratha, is very different from the food this restaurant peddles. Above all, their portions are amazingly small. Happy eating Chicago :)  Update 12/27- A good guy called me, apologies for the food and sent me food to correct. But he had been texting me to Change my review. Please don't contact me to update for a favourable review. Thank you for the food ( I paid for)",

So imagine my disappointment when I received a bland, pink-colored curry made with sweetened coconut milk. What a shame - any Indian knows that there is no place for coconut milk in Chicken Tikka Masala. The palak paneer was average. The uttapam was fine. The sambar was totally bland, underseasoned, oily, and inedible. I was promised delivery in 35 minutes. I took 100 minutes. Came cold. I can say with much confidence that this is FAR from the \"best\" in Chicago. Would not recommend.",

I didn't see any coloring agent or any excess oil in the food. Ordered starters and main dishes twice in the row. Their chettinad curry was amazing and had a unique flavor. Loved the kebabs and biryani which is a must try. Rice was cooked well and didn't feel it was overdone or was used too many spice, that's rare to be seen in Indian restaurants. Food was delivered a bit late but the owner apologized personally and complimented our order with a free dessert. I must say that was a nice gesture from the restaurant team. Again, food being of high quality, with less food coloring and no excess oil seem to be a healthy option for an Indian food take out place. I would recommend this restaurant to all and will order food again. - Nisha Rao & Krishna Darla",

We ordered vegetarian and non vegetarian curries (paneer, mushroom, chicken, lalmaas) along with appetizers, naans, wrap/frankie, sandwich, biryani(veg/non-veg) for all of us over 2 days to have a variety. All items arrived great, well packaged without any spills.  Great quality of food, very fresh and delicious to the palatte. All of us enjoyed the food; the taste is flavorful and rich. Biryaani, naans and curry are my favorite ! Great job, will keep coming back \ud83d\udc4d",
