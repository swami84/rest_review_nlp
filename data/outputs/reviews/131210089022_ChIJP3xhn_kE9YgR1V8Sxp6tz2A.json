Be careful, after the dip and appetizer you might begin to feel full! I had their fish-of-the-day, which was excellent Chilean Salmon. But, order the sides, the potatoes, the squash, the grits, yum! We were not able to make it to desert as we were \u201cstuffed\u201d. But the desert at the next table looked awesome.

The manager and a couple other waiters came over to apologize for the wait. The manager offered some appetizers on the house, which we appreciated. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and chicken tacos. The waiter recommended that we also try the calamari fries (adding that since it was on the house, why not?). We were glad that we tried the calamari too! It was delicious. We all enjoyed the small plates.  We got the Korean BBQ ($16) which was really just meat and bread. While the meat was very nicely flavored, I do wish there was a veggie side to balance out the heaviness of the meat and bread.  The salmon and grits ($19) were a little bland.  The dijon-roasted chicken breast ($16) was very flavorful and cooked nicely.  We got the roasted butternut squash gratin side ($6), which was very good!  The dessert sampler ($9) was impossible to pass up. My favorite was the chocolate cheesecake. The strawberry shortcake dessert was a little too sweet. The coconut cake dessert was good too. We split it between 4 people, and it was the perfect amount.  I felt that everything was reasonably priced, though with the drinks, it does add up!  We felt well taken care of with the small plates, which is why I am giving endive 5 stars. While the entrees left some to be desired, the delicious small plates and the ambiance of the restaurant and the bar make it worth coming back!",

Not terribly expensive for the quality of food.  My wife had the sea bass and I had the Korean barbecue pot roast and tomatoes mozzarella salad.  The food was absolutely amazing.  Not a very big place but excellent!  Never seen such a high Google rating but it definitely deserves it.",

We got so many compliments from our guests about the food at the wedding - YUMMY. Chef Drew - We went in for a tasting and Chef D hooked us up with an incredible spread. The presentation was amazing and the food was top notch. Very creative but yummy! Julia - Where do I begin? Julia was like my wedding bestie! From my first call with her to the last second, she was on it! Very approachable, which isn't always the case with wedding vendors. Very patient and kind. Her entire being makes you feel so safe and comfortable. I was sad that the wedding process was almost over because I knew I'd have to end all my communications with her! hahaa. But seriously, she made my wedding planning process a breeze! We've decided that we're going back to Endive every year at least once around our anniversary to remember the magic they made on our special day. CHOOSE them for your wedding/events. I'm a huge food critic and so is my family. We all LOVED the food but mostly, the people at Endive are magical beings! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!",

The salmon is always cooked so perfectly. Most places overcook their salmon and it ends up dry, but not endive. The Korean BBQ chuck roast is another delicious choice. I love the twice-baked potato side dish too. Staff is friendly and attentive. Be sure to make a reservation.  The also cater events. Our wedding planner recommended we try them and we're so glad we did. Theirs was the best tasting we attended as far as taste and presentation. They provided this HUGE tray with a variety of their apps, sides, and entrees. It actually brought a tear to my then fiance's eye. If I remember correctly, there's a minimum spend, so be aware. So highly recommended! We can also get some of the same menu items at the restaurant, so that a bonus when our anniversary rolls around and we're feeling nostalgic.",

They accommodated our dietary restrictions and encouraged us to customize our meal (mix and match across stations) without hesitation. From the very beginning, we were also worked with Endive\u2019s event coordinator. She was pivotal throughout and helped us plan each element of the meal. Endive (through working with other vendors) also arranged the dining area, including the setup and cleaning. The staff (stations, servers and bartenders) were focused and very courteous. Finally, the coordinator helped with overall planning and worked closely with our wedding planners to ensure everything ran smoothly. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our guests. It was the best wedding food many of us have ever experienced. We cannot recommend Endive enough; it was an absolute pleasure working with them.",

Our guests have not stopped talking about how good the food was and how many options there were to enjoy. On top of all of this, they really took care of us and our families : they made sure that my husband and I had appetizers and food prepared for us and they also took care of special requests for my brother who is allergic to gluten and dairy.

Chef Drew is awesome and easy to work with and we loved his desire to source locally and only use the very best ingredients. We knew from our tasting that we would have the best food available in Atlanta and we were right! Our guests raved about everything on the menu and working with Carol and Drew was an absolutely pleasure. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Endive catering :).",

        "caption": "Endive Catering is the way to go!!!  We had a wedding reception of about 215 people at a brewery (we had a small destination wedding).  The scene was casual and we had passed hors d'oeuvres and two \"stations\" of food.  By stations I mean two awesome spreads with multiple options each!  Endive Catering went above and beyond the call of duty, not only helping me with the catering/food side of things, but really acted as an event planner, decorator, and trusted advisor throughout the whole thing.  They were instrumental to the success of the party.  From the moment we met with Endive, we knew they were the best choice for us.  They were reasonably priced but offered outstanding food and customer service.  Having our party in a brewery as it was, we weren't trying to do anything overly fancy that didn't fit the space.  Endive worked with our vision of a casual, fun party and guided us in decisions to bring that to life. (though I have no doubts they could also rock a formal 7 course dinner party) They were never pushy or tried to add on expenses we didn't need.  I sincerely felt they had my best interests in mind. Shout out to Julia, who was incredible and I already miss talking to!  All of our guests raved about the food, the friendliness of the staff Endive provided, and how we turned an industrial brewery into an attractive, intimate event space.  Thank you Endive for helping me throw an awesome party for our guests!  I will not hesitate to use you again!",

        "caption": "Endive provided the catering for my wedding on February 2, 2013.  They were FABULOUS!!  The planning process started with Carol and Rhys.  They both took a lot of time to explain all of the different processes for our wedding reception.  They carefully reviewed the contract and types of menus.  Carol took so much time to help us decide what format to use and floor plan.  IT was incredibly helpful.  Now let's talk about the food.  It is obviously food that the chef, Drew, takes great pride in creating.  The food he prepares is beautiful...that is the only word I can use to describe it.  My new husband and I got countless text messages, Facebook posts, emails and phone calls from guests at the reception to tell us how much they enjoyed the food at our reception!!  We agreed.  Carol helped us decide which wines to purchase that would pair perfectly with each appetizer and entree.  I would highly suggest the Maryland crab fritters, slow simmered short ribs, chicken tagine and bourbon glazed salmon. The food is so fresh and beautifully prepared.  I am so incredibly happy with Endive and would recommend them to anyone that enjoys great food.  The price was also outstanding!  You can not get such high quality food for such a great price anywhere else.  The service, price and most importantly, the food was incredible!  Thank you Endive!!",
