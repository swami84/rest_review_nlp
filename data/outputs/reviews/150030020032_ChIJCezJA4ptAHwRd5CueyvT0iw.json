Now, I will warn you; if you don\u2019t like digging into your food, cracking shells with your hands and getting a little messy, this is NOT the place for you.  Otherwise, get ready for a fantastic feast!! The menu leads you through the process; it\u2019s something like this: 1. Pick your meat 2. Pick your sauce 3. Pick your spice level  We got the lobster combo with white & red sauce-no spice.  They bring you a bucket, bibs, and gloves and your table is covered in parchment paper. Then when your food is ready, they bring it out in bags and dump it on your table \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And you get Crackin\u2019!!  So yummy \ud83d\ude0b  My only regret was that we weren\u2019t able to do the sweet art afterwards (dessert). They called it that and they were not exaggerating. They bring out these colorful sauces and create a wonderful piece of art on the clean parchment paper, and then give you donuts and fruit to wipe it up. A table near us got it, so I was able to see it, but being Gluten Free it didn\u2019t make sense for us to get it. Definitely neat to watch though-how innovative!!  I highly, highly recommend the Crackin\u2019 Kitchen; it\u2019s a fun experience and delicious dining all at one time.",

As for the menu, I chose the recommended crackin kitchen special 2 to 3 people, and I thought that there are many in Hawaii and this was the correct answer. It was delicious without getting bored because the taste changed with the three-color sauce. I think that the drink was two cups of soft beer and two cups of soft drinks, but later it was just $ 130 for chips and taxes for just $ 100 using a 10% coupon on the JCB card.

We got two of the ultimate combos and one of each the black, red and white sauce in mild. Each had their own unique flavor. The white is more sweeter because of the sweet onion. The black was very rich in flavor due to the black pepper and the red was also similarly flavorful but packed a little more heat to balance the other two out. I was surprised it was not busier as this was a significantly better experience than boiling crab and would recommend anyone who likes that similar experience to try here. We will definitely be back.  **The above review was for the Pasadena location which has unfortunately been closed. So sad to see such a good restaurant close up shop close after only a few months.",

It should be noted that they were not very busy. Not once did anyone apologize for how long it took to get our food, if anything they seemed very oblivious. It ended up taking 2 hours total which is kind of ridiculous.  And the food tasted okay. For a place that was suppose to have a Cajun influence there was no bang/kick to our food.",

This place was brought to my attention through facebook. So I thought, why not give it a try. The service was amazing! The employees were extremely friendly and the owner of the restuarant as well. My husband ordered their gumbo and garlic rice. It was very delicious. Very fresh and aromatic... as for me.. they brought out this bag of crawfish which I thought was very interesting... they have me a bib, a pair of gloves, and a large paper table cover to eat the crawfish. It was quite alot for 1lb. Prices are very reasonable. When I started eating the crawfish... it was amazing!!!! The flavor is great and I loved that the owner of the restuarant even explained how to open crawfish properly just in case we didn't know. It is top quality fresh seafood. Very juicy, and soft. I was actually quite impressed with the seafood being that I am very picky when it comes to my sea chicken lol I will definitely be coming back to this place!!",

The sauces were great though the basic butter sauce is a little plain for my taste but others at our table liked it a lot. Dessert was limited to 2 choices. Both are malasadas. While a little heavier than malasadas from Hawaii they are still good. And our group loved the stuffed malasada which I never had before.

Since the table seats in the store were full of reservations, I was guided to the terrace seats, but the wind was so strong that I could fly away with napkins, so I asked the counter.  I made a king crab combo. The spiciness was mild, but the Cajun seasoning was still spicy. I like the white sauce taste. Wear vinyl gloves and eat crabs, I didn't judge it with gloves, so I ate it with bare hands. I only had hand towels, so I went to wash my hands several times.  The clerk is young and friendly, and every time I pass by delicious? Will ask. Since I sat at the counter, I might have been calling out a lot. You can see the work inside the counter well and never get tired. It was about 10,000 yen for two people including a salad and a drink. I ate full, and the clerk wanted to have fun again.

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) I went to eat with a friend from Japan. Children can enjoy eating it with their hands, so they enjoyed eating. The staff often look around, so it's easy to order additional drinks. Everyone is working happily, so the atmosphere of the shop is very good. Also, since there are many Japanese customers, there are staff who understand Japanese, so I think it is easier for people who are not confident in English to use it. The food is unique in Hawaii and has a consistent taste (it's always delicious). In addition to the chowder fried fried egg that I always go to, chicken wing, this time I ordered a lobster for the ultimate combo. The contents are gorgeous and you can enjoy red, black, & white sauces, so it is recommended. However, I was disappointed that the contents of king crab were dry. Finally, I ordered sweet art that was broadcast on King's branch the other day. You can write it cleanly, so it's a waste to eat! The fruits are sweet, and the homemade malasada is delicious alone, but it goes well with the sauce.  Not only crackin 'kitchen, but recently, the number of restaurants where the tip reference rate is stated on the receipt has increased. At other restaurants, I heard that there were many people in the past who did not pay (reduce) without knowing the service without knowing it, or did not pay (decrease) because it was wasteful. So don't be offended even if listed. Tips are etiquette in the United States, so be sure to pay them properly. You are the one who is ashamed of not paying.  Also, some people say \"10% chips is enough because the food was poor\", but that is wrong. Tips are not determined by the quality of food. \u30fb Take an order \u30fb Bring a drink or meal \u30fb Take care of customers At the very least, you'll be well served (the standard tip in Hawaii is currently 18%). It is true that general Japanese restaurants have high quality of service, so we tend to use that as the standard, but this is the United States (Hawaii). If you're making a comparison, don't compare it to Japanese services, but to a store in Hawaii.  Had dinner with a friend of mine who \u2019s visiting us from Japan. Kids loved to eat these gorgeous seafoods, spam, and veggies by their hands (so adults did)! Friendly staffs always care for the customers if we had enough drinks, foods, etc. Their food is always fantastic (which is unusual in Hawaii lol)! I ordered chowder fries with egg, chicken wings, and ultimate combo with lobster.I love the way I could try 3 different sauces! One disappointing thing was the king crab. It was a bit dried. Other than that, we were super satisfied with their food! Also we ordered a beautiful 3D dessert art. Fruits were sweet. Malasadas, not to mention themselves were delicious but with their original sauces, they were just like a heaven! We enjoyed their foods, drinks, and service :) I definitely comeback soon !!!

 Had dinner with a friend of mine who\u2019s visiting us from Japan. Kids loved to eat these gorgeous seafoods, spam, and veggies by their hands (so adults did)! Friendly staffs always care for the customers if  we had enough drinks, foods, etc. Their food is always fantastic (which is unusual in Hawaii lol)! I ordered chowder fries with egg, chicken wings, and ultimate combo with lobster. I love the way I could try 3 different sauces! One disappointing thing was the king crab. It was a bit dried. Other than that, we were super satisfied with their food! Also we ordered a beautiful 3D dessert art. Fruits were sweet. Malasadas, not to mention themselves were delicious but with their original sauces, they were just like a heaven! We enjoyed their foods, drinks, and service:) I definitely comeback soon!!!",

I let it go and began to eat 2 shrimp and when I got to the 3rd it tasted under cooked. I threw that 1 away and went to eat another but that was also undercooked. So I began to eat the crab legs and after eating the first leg the second was undercooked as well. I threw the rest of that bag away and didnt even attempt to eat the second bad. Sure enough 3 hours later I woke up vomiting all of the seafood I did manage to eat. I wish I would've read the other reviews about the food not being well cooked before even going.",
