Order two different pizzas and both were delicious. They have a ton of draft beers. Interior decor is really cool, with a disco platform up a ladder and basically what looked to be the front of a car. Service was friendly and attentive. I wanted to buy one of their Pint classes and Manager (maybe owner?) was so accommodating and let us. This place was not really on our radar, but so glad we found it. I would return without hesitation. Lunch was great with teenagers. Had 80's and 90's music playing which Mom and Dad enjoyed. Highly recommend for lunch and even though we did not eat dinner, feel like dinner would be great also.",

Being that it was a weekend, and Valentine's day weekend at that, I wasn't surprised by the long wait time given to pick up. What did put me off was the process I had to go through attempting to cancel my order. First tried calling, only to get an answering service. No biggie, I figured, I'm in the area. I'll swing by and do it in person. Got there, was barely greeted by the hostess, had to practically wade through to get to the bar, just to be told (!) That \"we don't use that delivery service\". Bartender looked at me like I sprouted another head when I showed her that I received a confirmation text. A simple \"sorry for the confusion\" would've sufficed, but even that seemed like too much effort lol not impressed. Went to Fat tiger at the Broadway market, which was also packed, and got served quickly and professionally.",

Meatballs are to die for. Top 3 of what we have had, possibly number 1. Simple tomatoe sauce on top is the kicker. Finally, half orders of pasta dishes. How many times have you been out and you both want pasta and pizza and it is too much food???? Well, this place allows for half orders of pasta. How awesome is that AND the pasta and pizza is perfect!  Al dente and great pizza. Thx Disco!!!!!",

Complimentary breadsticks seemed clones of Olive Garden breadsticks in appearance, crumb and taste.  Pizza was very good with very nice crust and well-seasoned sauce.  Also got a half-size serving of cacio e pepe, which was a little too al dente for my preference and too salty (although not to the point of being inedible).  Serving sizes are very generous.",

Food is surprisingly good as I was expecting basics and got carefully structured dishes with lots of flavor and character.  Appetizers were all on the spot and very good.  Meatballs I expected more.  But pasta was exceptional.  Too much salt, but texture and taste of a homemade pasta.  So the food is definately 4 stars.  Now on to music... Italian Disco or as many knew Italo Disco along with Eurodance run the world in 80's.  I was so looking forward to hearing that again.  But instead I got an ear full of some boring 70's/80's and even some current songs.  What a shame.  I seriously doubt that DJ even knows what is Italian Disco.  In fact, host had no clue and told me that they just play 70'/80's music.  So call it Oldies Disco and do not insult Italian. Music.   2 Stars for entertainment.  With that music place pretty much unsurprisingly cleared by 11:10pm on Saturday night.  Get real DJs that play real Italo and Euro Disco and you got something no other place has. Food is already there.  And for those that think the place is too loud, why don't you eat dinner at restaurant that does not have \"Disco\" in their name.   Dudh!",

This group of restaurants teamed up with their sister places The Elk Room and Tagliata for a night of great food, excellent drinks and three types of entertainment. Piano Bar sing-a-long at Tagliata\u2019s, 3-piece Jazz trio at The Elk Room and a DJ at Italian Disco. We party-hopped, ate, drank, danced and sang until the party was over at 3am!! That was a big deal for my friends and I being in our mid-40\u2019s. We can only stay out that late when we\u2019re having fun and we were, all night long! It was worth every penny of the ticket price and fees. We hope this party happens again next year but in the meantime, we plan on coming back throughout the year to all 3 places. Thank you for a great time!!",

We sat at the bar and had a small pizza & breaded fried olives...nothing particularly remarkable but also no complaints, and I'd come back if I was in the area, although I wouldn't make a special trip - if I lived closer I could see myself coming more often since it isn't super expensive and It's like a friendly little neighborhood place. They also have a good selection of craft beers if you like that - I wanted to try a hard cider but they were out of it. We sat at the bar and talked with a guy who lived around the corner and was picking up carry out - he said he gets carry out regularly and he really loves the food here, so that's a good recommendation. It's primarily a younger crowd so it depends on what you're looking for. No frills and decent food - worth a visit if you're in the area.",
