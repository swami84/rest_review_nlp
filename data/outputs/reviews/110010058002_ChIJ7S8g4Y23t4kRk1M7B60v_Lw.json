Organization and operations are not great as we ordered on Xmas using their online ordering system as no one was answering the phones. I never received confirmation that they had received my online order so after calling approximately 20 times (literally) I finally did speak to someone who was very nice and was able to confirm and modify my order. He instructed me it would take at least an hour so I waited appropriately and went to pick up the food. However, I came to the restaurant only to find over a dozen people waiting for food, most of which seemed like delivery drivers. They had no clear organization system, and I could tell the kitchen and staff were overwhelmed. After waiting for about 15 minutes without being helped I asked if I could cancel my order because I couldn\u2019t wait longer \u2014miraculously the front person (the person I had spoken to over the phone previously) found my order right away. I paid and left, and upon arriving home, I  was pleasantly surprised and excited to find everything was as it should be. We ordered General Tso chicken, steamed vegetable dumplings, and Moo Shu chicken. The Dumplings were OK but a little doughy and not too flavorful. The General Tso chicken was excellent and not spicy as I had requested. The Moo Shu chicken was also fantastic. I definitely recommend this restart and would order again but hope that they have their ordering system and operations figured out.",

It came out a pale shade of gray and was exceedingly dry and flavorless -- a shame because BBQ pork is a staple of any good Cantonese restaurant.  To our surprise everything else was delicious! The dishes came out hot, fast, and fresh. The vegetables were perfectly cooked, and the chicken and beef wonderfully tender.

The food is of very low quality - even worse than those from the by-the-street carryout shops. The soup is close to adding hot water to vegitable, tofu and meat. No flavor at all; steamed vegatibles are, well, STEAMED vegitable. Does the cook there even know (or care) how to add some flavor (salt, for example)? The waitresses are not friendly. They put the food on the table, and then, leave you there. The next moment they attend you is the time you pay - AND THEY CARE ABOUT THE TIP YOU GIVE (like the other reviewer wrote). I have been to many Asian restraunts, and more or less, the waitresses/waiters ask during the meal if I feel the food is ok and if I need anything else. NONE whatsoever here.

She would watch you writing the tip and urge you to give more. When we take our pick-up order, she even asked me for tip as well. And she shows angry and impatience obviously if you don\u2019t pay her tips on pick-up order. I really hope the owner of the restaurant could know what she did to many clients. It may hurt the business of restaurant.",

All customers who were there that day have a look on their faces of regret eating there..they can't wait to finish on their meal so they can run from that monster chinese woman and restaurant..plus I saw the food on their plates were horrible, I'm Asian and I know if the dish is good or not by the look of it...so don't waste your time and money on this place!

I have never felt more disrespected or been more livid with an establishment in my life-- in fact, it's taken me 5 days to even come to leave this review in hopes that someone will see it and save themselves the headache. This restaurant is at the beginning of Chinatown in Washington DC and it's open late night, unlike some of the restaurants nearby. I came in with two friends on Saturday night; two of us were visiting the city and one is local. As for the food, it's your regular Chinese/Cantonese menu; eggrolls, beef and broccoli and an assortment of noodle dishes. None of the food was exceptionally good, although I'm not sure that the staff cared seeing that they never came by to check on our food after we received it. It's an intimate space and I was very excited to see what they had to offer. During our meal, my friends and I witnessed one of the waitresses screaming at a man out in the lobby because he had dozed off while waiting for his to go order. Initially, I thought this was bizarre and unprofessional, but kept on with my meal. When it came time to pay, I asked the waitress for change for $100 bill. My friend paid for my meal on his debit card and I intended to leave her a cash tip. When she brought back my money, I quickly counted it as she stood there waiting. She rudely interrupted our exit and asked \"tip in cash?\". This immediately irritated me because as I stated, I am in the service industry myself and that's just something you don't do. She continued to stand there and I gave her a tip that I felt was reflective of her service- we left. When I got back to the car, I counted the change in my hand and realize that I was short. I didn't have a chance to count the money thoroughly when I was inside the restaurant because the waitress was being so invasive. I quickly went back inside to see what had happened and both women were sitting there almost waiting on my return. The waitress tried to explain that she gave all my change back, but I am fully aware of my belongings. I requested to have my money returned. The two exchanged some conversation and I told them to just give my money back ($10 was all I asked for). The woman in charge gave me $10, apologized and told me to have a good night. However, after returning to the car again, I realized that I was actually missing $30 in total and had only gotten a portion back. Not sure if I happened to drop money on the floor and it was picked up or the waitress never gave me back all of my change to begin with, but that's beside the point. This place LACKS HONESTY AND INTEGRITY and I spent the rest of my trip telling others to NEVER visit. You just don't do that to people. It's a shame that this particular waitress finds the need to prey on people who are just trying to have a nice experience. I hope that you used the $20 in a way that is useful.",

Then, we were given our check when we weren't finished yet and then the waitress stood over us while we added the tip to our receipts. Also, when I started to put my leftovers into the box, the waitress took it from me and did it herself, without saying anything to me. Additionally, the prices were ridiculous. I paid almost $19 for a shrimp fried rice noodle dish with a 10% tax and 15% tip added on. And then the fortune cookies were very stale. I wouldn't bother going here again.",

Part of our desicion to eat here was based on price. They all seem to be around the same price point although a few were more costly. This place is in a basement and very small. I think there was only around 10 tables so we had to wait a little bit. All the servers were Asian, and were not very friendly. They seemed to be rushing my order. We were served hot tea as we sat down at no charge. There were 3 of us sitting at a large table, so without asking us, they sat 2 more people at our table. I didn\u2019t mind, but they should have asked first. The food was served quickly. It seemed to be authentic, as I ended up ordering something I didn\u2019t like because it was a special designed for 2 or 3 people. Roast Duck was dry and yucky. I found out I do not like watercress soup. The veggies were not very flavorful and a little undercooked. We also had plain rice and large seasoned shrimp with the heads still attached. That turned my stomach although I did try it and it was dry. The menu said dessert was included so I asked our server about it. She said it was an orange, then she brought out diced pineapple. I forgot that Asian restaurants never have decent desserts! I tipped under 15%, and  I wasn\u2019t hassled about it at all.",

Service was ok and had the right amount of servers for the size of the restaurant. They spoke Cantonese and Mandarin. I wanted to order an eggplant chicken casserole/pot which comes pretty standard in Cantonese restaurants but it wasn't on the menu. Usually places will put it together for you since it's not hard, but this one didn't or at least the server didn't write it down right. So we ordered an eggplant dish on the menu, the beef short ribs with eggplant casserole and the tofu with veggies. The latter came with tons of veggies which was great. The former I think was two separate dishes smashed together. Which wasn't bad, just different. Both were entirely on the salty side though. Portions were large and the two of us didn't finish the food.",

I ordered the general tso's chicken and it tasted exactly like the orange chicken. There was more breading and sauce then there was chicken. And The chicken itself had a very bad texture and was not appetizing at all. The rice was extremely bland, and for the price I paid I could've eaten more and had better food at panda express, or even the food court in any shopping mall. The tea kettle they brought for us wasn't clean at all, and my fork wasn't either. There was also a brown speck stuck in between the fork, so obviously they don't do dishes very well. I peeked into the kitchen and was absolutely disgusted. Poorly maintained, and definitely far from clean. The mere sight of the kitchen made me want to throw up. I paid 16.45, which was far too expensive for what I received. When she gave me my check, she said \"make sure to leave a tip\", as if I were  obligated to do so considering the service I recieved. I was stared down when I received my change, and when I proceeded to walk out one of the servers chased me out of the store demanding a tip. She gave me and my friend a demeaning stare and made us feel like we obligated to put more than a dollar (and that was us being polite). She raised her voice at us just yelling \"fifteen percent!\". This same server was the same person who sneezed in their hands and then gave a different group their menu's. I've never been more unsatisfied in my life at any food service establishment. Even if I don't enjoy a place, it is very seldom I write a bad review - but this place was genuinely the worst place I've ever been too. I decided to try something new, and ended up longing for McDonald's. Avoid at all costs.",

Food was mediocre, certainly not the best. My husband and I refused to tip (which we have NEVER done) and they literally chased us out the door yelling at us.

Very sketchy if you ask me. I've worked as a server and usually tip 20% minimum but decided that her blantant disrespect did not warrant any tip. After collected our receipts from the table, she came back to confront me about not tipping (something I'd never ever do when I served). She left the receipt on the table expecting me to add a tip and when she came back for it seeing I didn't add any additional money she gave me a death stare and obviously trash talked about us in her native language.

We thought we might want to grab a bite in Chinatown before we head into the 2-3 game and spend ridiculous dollars for hot dogs and nachos at the stadium.  We strolled around and decided to settle here because it doesn't look very crowded (which is something you never do, no business means they are not on par, right?). We ordered a salty fish chicken fried rice and (tried to be adventurous) snails with black bean paste (think escargot but with the shell and you have to figure out how to get the snail out from its shelter to eat it). Fried rice was alright, but we literally spent most of our time trying to figure out how to eat the snails.  Price was not okay for the food we had. It was $40+ for two plates of food. I am guessing we are paying for the location/rent so I will let this go. Next time I will just get a chipotle-to-go before the game. I am slowly losing hope for this already-sloppy-Chinatown in DC.",

The waitress took care of the situation way too comfortably as if she has had to before.  Within a minute she grabbed a chair, squished the ginormous bug and wiped the wallpaper and walked away. There was no apology or even no sense of surprise from the waiters and waitresses. It was gross beyond belief and I will never step foot in there again or let anyone I know go in there.  We told patrons outside to enter at their own risk.  I never go on to review restaurants unless it was an amazing experience or in this case a horrible horrible one.
