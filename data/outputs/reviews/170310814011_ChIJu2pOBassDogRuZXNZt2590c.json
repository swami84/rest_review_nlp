Well, of course it is good, but not what I expected for a fine dining restaurant like this. Especially the lamb main course\u2014it is totally a disappointment. But anyways, their foie gras is really really good, probably one of the best that I ever had in the US. Their dessert and starter are not bad as well. Not to be offensive to anybody, but their customers are mainly elder people. So do expect that classical vibe (from both the diners and the deco). Service is not bad. Descent. Probably won\u2019t come back again. The experience just doesn\u2019t get me.",

They seated us on the second floor near the fire place and it was darling and so romantic.\u00a0 We had a fixed menu with many options.\u00a0\u00a0 Started with Artichoke terrine, petite salade, hazelnut vinaigrette and Seared Hudson Valley, foie gras, baked apple, banana water and they were both perfect in taste and so delicious.\u00a0 To be honest, I didn't think I'd enjoy the four gras but it was perfection.\u00a0 We also enjoyed the Mixed greens Belgian endive salad fresh Wisconsin goat cheese, carmelized pecans and walnuts, red wine vinaigrette.\u00a0 For dinner we ordered the Braised Wagyu beef short rib, pommes gratin, sauce Bordelaise and the Beef tenderloin.\u00a0 Both were cooked to perfection and so tender with lots of flavor.\u00a0 For dessert, we love chocolate so we ordered the Warm flourless chocolate cake, liquid cassis ganache center, vanilla ice cream and the Double chocolate cake, cremeux, brownie biscuit, truffle chantilly.\u00a0 The double chocolate was FIRE!\u00a0 They also brought out some mini desserts in the end that they prepare in house and they were so cute and yummy.\u00a0 Definitely recommend this restaurant and can't wait to come back.\u00a0 Our server Josie was incredible!\u00a0 She was so cute, kind, and attentive.\u00a0 She had some great recommendations.\u00a0 Carlos I believe was the manager, he made sure to keep the fire place going all night and a great conversationist.\u00a0 Thanks for a lovely evening.",

Souffle is the best I have ever tasted. The inside has a foam like texture and was absolutely delicious. Will definitely come back. Service was also flawless. The food was definitely worth the steep price tag.",

We were the last people in the upstairs dining room, when we were approached incredibly rudely and told that we basically had to get out. The manner in which we were approached was improper and off putting considering we were guests dropping $ 500+  on dinner and drinks. Interestingly enough, in the past month my companion and I have been the last people in Everest and Prime and Provisions too. There was a stark difference in how we were treated as the last guests of the house at Everest and Prime & Provisions vs. Les Nomades. Considering your paying for atmosphere and service, as well as the food, skip Les Nomades. Too many nice high dollar places in Chicago that will treat you properly if you are a paying guest. The impression that was made by the person notifying us that we were no longer welcome, was that we were an inconvenience. Don't think the waiter understood paying customers sitting in the restaurant provide him with employment. No customers equates to no job in the service industry. Pretty simple basics missing from the staff. Skip it.",

However, apart from that, neither of us were very impressed. We have been to high end French restaurants in other cities (Philadelphia, Boston) and this one was not even close in quality of food or service. The hostess was very nice but our waiter and servers were rather stiff, saying very little and barely cracking a smile.  The decor was very nice, but sadly the ambiance was ruined by a large obnoxious group of older adults sitting right behind us. My wife and I would barely have a conversation with those folks cackling behind us. It would have been nice if the staff offered a gentle reminder of their own stated noise policy.  The food: Appetizers were tasty - I enjoyed my artichoke salad very much. Both of us ordered the mushroom soup with high hopes. It tasted like mushrooms in warm milk with a little froth on top. I couldn't believe they were actually serving that in this caliber of restaurant. Both of our main courses were average - nothing that made either one of us go wow, especially not for the price.  Overall, we had a pleasant evening but I would not go back here personally; not even if they lowered the price dramatically.",

I managed to find street parking right across, so I lucked out.  Upon arriving, there was a woman standing almost in the pathway to the restaurant. I paused for a second, and she asked me if I was going to Les Nomades. After saying yes, she opened the door for me and led me into the restaurant.  They greeted me by name, which is always nice, and I was promptly seated. Normally, I don't care too much about service, as long as it's not horrible. However, this was a nice dinner, and I was about to be a bit surprised.  I was handed the menu. Since I was just interested in the 3 course, I mentioned it to the server since it wasn't listed. He asked me if I had a Savored reservation, and I replied no. He then walked to the back, got another menu, and gave it to me. This one was for the 3-course Savored menu. After a minute or two, he eventually came back with yet another menu, swapping the one I had again. He apologized and said that there is a special 3-course for $65 for early reservations, and that the Savored menu is different.  As I sat figuring out what to order, I could hear him talking in the back about how he felt like a used car salesman (probably because he kept bothering me). Yes, I could almost hear every single word he was saying, since he was maybe a dozen feet away. During my meal, he mentioned something about trimming some trees.  The meal itself was superb. Very solid dishes, with the exception of a couple.  1. Warm vegetable soup amuse Really good. I can't remember the vegetable, but it was a very nice amuse.  2. Seared diver scallop, heirloom squash, chorizo, preserved black garlic Delicious. Scallops were perfectly cooked, and the dish was excellent, even though I didn't taste the chorizo.  3. Loup de Mer with lobster rago\u00fbt, preserved Meyer lemon, Cognac jus Delicious. Sea bass was perfectly cooked, one of the best I've had. The greens were excellent, as was the lobster jus.  4. Fruit sorbet palate cleanser Okay. Sorbet was very good, but the berry sauce that came with it was unusual. It reminded me of a chunky Jamba smoothie.  5. Warm chocolate tart with raspberries, white coffee bean ice cream, vanilla froth and chocolate sauce Okay. \"Warm\" was more like \"piping hot,\" and I probably would have burned myself if I dug in right away. The coffee ice cream was okay, but I don't recall any vanilla froth. There was also a side piece of raspberry chocolate, which was excellent. Fresh raspberries were delicious. There was a hint of lemon sauce on my plate (which I'm assuming was an accident), but it was delicious. Wish I had gotten that instead.  6. Macaron, jelly, chocolate, and biscuit Mediocre. Macaron was so-so, and the chocolate was very rich.  7. Pomegranate soda, 7 Pretty good. I got this instead of alcohol since I was driving after.  If you like rare meat, the venison loin is good. If you like medium meat, the veal is good. I decided to get the sea bass this time.  Service during the meal was good, but very stiff, as everyone else has mentioned. Also, no one wished me happy birthday, which would have been nice since it was jotted on my reservation.  The couple across from me also spoke on their phone and had a server take a picture. I understand it's your anniversary, but the menu specifically states no phones or cameras (hence no pictures from me this time). My server was also their's, and he was much friendlier to them, even volunteering to have them sample some fish and wine.  Total was about $95 after tax/tip. The food was excellent, but I wouldn't come back again since it's pretty overpriced and the service was disappointing.",

The staff is efficient,attentive and knowledgeable  The atmosphere is inviting and quiet.  They have a dress code that eliminates having to look at someone wearing a wrinkled plaid shirt, grungy jeans and flip flops. If elegance and sophistication is your thing, it's a must visit.",
