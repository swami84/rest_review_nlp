The venue (his home) was spacious and laid out well, he was very prepared and he not only explained his own cooking techniques but also the cultural history of each menu item served. I learned things I can use at home (he places an emphasis on this) and he made me want to visit other countries I\u2019ve never been to. It was a great experience and I highly recommend.",

The class was interactive, so if we needed to ask a question, we could do that. There was one couple who had a problem with their rice. He gave a tip and it worked! That's helpful in case we ever run into a problem in the future. We will definitely be doing this again! Thank you Chef Made Master.",

She was such an accommodating, gracious, personable, amazing chef and host, and everything we could have hoped for. From the moment I heard back from her via Cozymeal, to her coming out to my boyfriends apartment cook with us, I couldn't have imagined anything better.  We had a bit of a snafu in that I ended up suffering from a stomach bug on the night of our dinner, which Meg still graciously made for my boyfriend and saved me some for when I was feeling better. My absence was no hinderance, though, as he still had a great time and delicious meal (Duck, Duck, Mousse, by the way). However, Meg in all her awesomeness reached out the next day and subsequent days to inquire how I was feeling, and we were ultimately able to reschedule a time to do our dinner in full, this time at her place. She and sous chef Doug (he's a dog, and he's the best) gave us one of the best meals of my life, made exceptional by her humor, wit, cooking skills, and relatable food (and life) tips.  I feel like I could go on and on about our experience(s) with Meg. If you want quality food and to meet one of the best people to exist - you can't go wrong!",

The class itself was great -- Cece was lovely and the kids (ages 9, 12 and 14) got to do a lot of hands on work. And the end result was beautiful and delicious!  My only suggestion is that she communicate more in advance regarding the logistics of the class. It was school night (only night offered) and she arrived 30 minutes late (she called, it was traffic). But then there was another 20+ minutes of her doing prep (nothing for kids to do), so we didn't start until almost 7 with the kids just sitting around (could have been doing homework). Would have also saved time if she had told me in advance what she would need from my kitchen (knives, platters etc) so I could get those ready in advance. And it would be great if there were a leave-behind recipe/instructions so we feel more confident that we could make on our own.  All that said, the kids loved it, Cece was wonderful and we will be making sushi again.",

From the moment we arrived, Chef Judith was super friendly and approachable.  We felt very comfortable and really appreciated many of the tips she provided not only in food preparation, but tips on how to cut safely, how to create our own spiral zucchini noodles using a mandolin. or her favorite must have spices to keep in stock.  She made us feel right at home and we felt like we were preparing dinner at home with a friend.  Great conversation throughout the evening.  I have already recommended her to others for catering services and will continue to do so.  Looking forward to giving Cozymeal with Chef Judith as a gift in the future.  It's an absolutely amazing gift!  One that I will never forget!!",

From private lessons at your own home for a bday or anniversary to setting up a cooking class at an art gallery or your place of business or renting out a cool AirBNB place to host an event....the talented expert chefs at Cozymeal will show up and make it a fun-filled and delicious gathering!  I went with a group of friends to meet Chef Gwyn. Her motto was all about eating fresh food and staying away from processed food. We learned how to make a citrusy mixed greens salad with fresh glazed peaches, toasted pecans, and Gorgonzola cheese. The combination of these ingredients was absolutely palatable. The dressing was made from fresh orange juice, lemon zest, olive oil, honey and white pepper. Is your mouth watering yet?  Main course was fresh ravioli stuffed with goat cheese mixed with fresh garlic and herbs. We learned how to make it from scratch! It was fun and entertaining and Chef Gwyn taught us many tricks. Fresh pasta is easy to make! Why buy processed!?  Dessert was a hot Chocolate Chipotle Lava Cake with a scoop vanilla and a fresh strawberry. Absolutely luscious and delicious!  We had fun! It was a group of 8. We chatted, drank some wine, made new friends, cooked and learned how easily you can make a fresh, home cooked meal. Stay healthy friends! Stay away from processed foods.",

The chef was very knowledgeable, approachable and really easy to deal with. We had a fun experience creating our meal and the hands-on experience was rewarding as well.

She teached us how to make Ratatouille and we had it as starter, we baked some cookies and brownies together and it was so much fun. My favorite part was when we made fresh pasta from scratch. As an avid cook, I found the experience amazing. I highly recommend everyone to have this experience, there is something to learn for everyone!",
