We ordered four varieties of pupusas: pork, bean, zucchini, and cheese. All four varieties tasted good, and we like the zucchini the most",

Short ribs are tender and delicious, the veggies on the side with the meal were impressively tasty.  Care is put into every element of the food.",

Calamari, filet skewers, scallops, crab soup, mussels, and 3 desserts. ALL amazing.  We wondered how everything would travel (back to Gaithersburg), but they are absolute pros with preparation and packaging. A real treat. Friendly staff, too. We loved it and will return.",

        "caption": "I've read all the reviews about our new restaurant and respect everyone's opinion. For what it's worth here is my take on Chef Tony's. The last time I ordered food from outside of my home was March 27th 2020. This was due to precautions against covid. Having seen how careful Tony's staff is I was finally comfortable with placing a to go order. I ordered the chicken parmigiana special. Being a big person I order the double chicken breast. It came with pasta and saut\u00e9ed spinach in garlic for $18.95. I could only eat half of my portion. Basically 2 meals for the price. The chicken was nicely pan-fried with linguini in homemade sauce. The spinach in garlic was good eventhough I needed to add a little sea salt ( my preference). Tony's front house staff were courteous, and efficient. I ordered at 5:15 for 6:10 pick and didn't have to wait. I know the Chef is working on different items to be more supportive of the buildings needs but he is running a business to serve the neighborhood community. As time goes on please give him and his staff constructive thoughts. I think happy hour is on its way as the county opens up sitting regulations and he is planning on service outside as the weather gets nicer. Tony's is very considerate of people's dietary needs as well. He has always provided my wife with allergy safe gluten free food even before people were dealing with celiac patients Regardless  I hope everyone can enjoy.",
