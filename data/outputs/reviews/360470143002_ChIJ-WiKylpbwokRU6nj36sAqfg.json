Amazing food, great service, and their custom outdoor eating area is very pleasant. Their chicken parm is my personal favorite. And prices you can't beat! Will definitely be coming for more!",

As an industry person, I think the quality of the food supersedes the prices but I'm sure that is an opening strategy- if it's not, this place is a goldmine & you better soak it up. Welcome to the Slope. Thankfully, your neighbor.",

We went with our newborn and they accommodated us well - the place just opened a few days ago so it was empty enough that some baby sounds weren\u2019t going to annoy, but we probably won\u2019t do that once it gets busy.  The vibe and layout is very similar to the Lopez bakery that was there before. Service was good. They were able to accommodate some special dietary requests and checked with the chef for us.  The food was really good! We had just regular meatballs with penne that were good and the portion was a nice size. My wife had the bass which she was very impressed with and was cooked perfectly for her. We also got a bowl of roasted vegetables that was great. Even the thin slices of garlic bread that came before the meal were tasty and light. It was also a really fair price for the quality.  Looking forward to coming back here.",
