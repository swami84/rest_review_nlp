Opel is a phenomenal host and a master in fusing personal and culinary experience. The entire staff - especially his son Lio - is incredibly hospitable and friendly, always making sure your experience is catered to how you want to feel and what you\u2019d like to taste. It is heaven for any adventurous (or not) eater. Easily the best Thai food I\u2019ve ever had, and also some of the best service you could imagine.

He asked what we liked and make accordingly, including a drunken noodle plate with both shrimp and chicken, as I don't like shrimp. The staff was extremely friendly, and we had a fantastic time with fantastic food. The price was absolutely worth it and it seemed reasonable as well, and we'll be going back.

Few min later, he came with food said try this you guys will like it. We were like what ?! Was this on house. We didn\u2019t even know the prices and if we ordered the food.. anyway just very confusing. We asked server about the price of the food on our table and she said I will be right back. The owner came and told us we can stop serving food if that isn\u2019t what you guys wanted... we were like we never wanted the food that on our table and he kept saying it\u2019s about the prices. It\u2019s about the prices... so we didn\u2019t know the price still and $75 total for 2 ppl.......  So food weren\u2019t what we want and somewhere got rip off in legal way .... not my type of service I would like and lack of communication  But I will always remember not to come back again.

Opal is awesome, he comes out to your table and has a chat with you regarding your likes and dislikes, allergies and where and if you have travelled to Thailand. He is from Bangkok and his wife is from Isan.  After finding out that my date and I are experienced eaters, HAVE been to Thailand, and that we love to try new things, he was off to put in our order.  They must have their liquor license, I have seen some reviews questioning it. We got their signature sangria which is made with a red wine and plenty of fruit. It is so amazing, we had to order two. The best part is eating the wine soaked fruit right from the glass once you have consumed the beverage.  He told us what we ate when we had completed our meal. He is pleasant and eager to share culinary experiences and how he got started from a humble food truck beginning.  Pay attention to the instructions on how to eat. If you aren't instructed...ASK HIM!  The half special cake was a sticky firm fish. So soft with an interesting texture. But oh so delicious. The crunch of the bean sprouts and the fresh cilantro help to round out this dish nicely.  The flavor profile that he and his wife create their culinary masterpieces just overwhelm your mouth with balance between spicy, sweet, savory and acid.  The crispy rice salad with the sausage was just amazing. I loved it. So tasty and with fresh ginger and crunchy cabbage helped offset the fatty crispy rice and Isan style sausage. Like I said, perfect balance.  The Kao Soy soup with chicken was cooked perfectly. The chicken fell off of the bone and the sour soup was the perfect compliment. He actually brought me out this special hot chili condiment to eat with it and it paired perfectly. I was SWEATING!  The sauteed eggplant and crunchy string bean dish cooked to perfection. A great veggie dish. So savory and herbacious with tomatoes and crunchy fried basil!  The total experience, including talking with Opal was Amazing! I decided there that this would be my new favorite restaurant. We spoke of a few dishes that we wanted to try, a fried cat fish fluff and Kra Pao. We also wanted to have a curry with the small eggplant the size of marbles and a special crab dish. He asked that we call him a few days in advance so he could get the ingredients.  Don't get me wrong, if you are stuffy and unable to be adventerous, perhaps this isn't the place for you. If you are fun and willing to be amazed by culinary experiences outside of your comfort zone, then head on down. Let him guide you on a culinary tour of Thailand. Just let go and enjoy what you are served.",

You can tell your favorite Thai food, Thai food you have eaten recently and leave it to the owner. Even if you don't understand English, it's okay if you know Thai food names (Gapao, Tom Yum, etc.). When I told them that I had recently eaten Passille, the noodles of the ramen noodles turned into plain noodles of Passille. The owner is friendly and talks quite a bit.

We didn\u2019t select a thing off the menu as chef decided what he thought we would like and we loved every plate! Starting with Moo Ping! (honey pork bbq skewers) and northern Thai sausages. Then one of my favorites Khao Soi and my wife got spicy pork with chili\u2019s basil and eggplant. The food was great, the experience was friendly and unique.

Even if you lived in Thailand for years and know the exact dish you want, he still tries to act like he knows better than you. I\u2019ve even heard unsavory stories from friends regarding his temper and how he has treated employees in the past...none of which I could verify.  But when it comes down to the food, it\u2019s ok. If you don\u2019t care how big your bill is and you don\u2019t know what to order this may be the place.

The owner will not allow you to order your own food, but rather plan a meal for you without giving you any price beforehand. Although, oddly enough you are presented with a menu beforehand. After 3 plates of food arrived to our table one after another we asked them to stop as we were not looking to run up a tab without knowing the price. We left annoyed and still hungry as the food was so-so and not very filling. If the owner and restuarant itself had been more upfront about the experience we could have enjoyed ourselves a little bit more. But trying to steal people's hard earned money under the guise of \"this is how we do it here\" is wrong and disgusting.",

The staff was friendly and the owner was just amazing...great host! My entire family had so much fun! Food was simply delicious...hadn\u2019t tasted anything like it before! My husband is a tough one to please with food and trust me, he was speechless! He was in awe of everything that touched his tongue lol. The owner was so sweet to my 8yr old son who was half asleep by the end of dinner. The owner went to grab a blanket and laid it on a bench and he carried my little one on the bench so he can sleep while we finish our dinner, what a gem! Can\u2019t wait to go back again",

Interesting because the owner, Opal, personally takes all the orders and customizes the menu based on dietary preferences. Ours was quite difficult, basically vegan plus no onion or garlic. Since Opal takes the orders himself, he is very personable with everyone but also very specific in the way he works so he is tough on his staff. The food was PHENOMENAL. Loved and enjoyed every bite. If only we\u2019d known about this place sooner in our visit, we\u2019d probably have come every day. Hands down the best customized Thai food ever. HIGHLY recommended.

The flavors are really bold and attack every taste bud that you have. I could not put my fork/spoon/chopstick down, it was just so good.

After watching the tables around us his behavior looks like a scam to get more money out of his customers.  We chose the restaurant because it had high Google reviews and it was on the way to the airport. After being seated, the owner came by and took the menu out of my hands. He then asked us to name 5 Thai dishes, saying we couldn't name some of the more popular ones. He was aggressive and this immediately put me on edge.  He claims this is a way for him to learn your tastes so he can cook specifically for you, but if you watch the other tables everyone is getting the same dishes. Really he's just bullying you, so that you\u2019re too insecure to order your own food. This lets him order for you and run up the bill. The tables around us that let him take over had more food in front of them than they would ever eat.  I was turned off by this behavior and ordered chicken pad thai, which he harassed me for. When it arrived, tofu was mixed in with the chicken. My pad thai and the appetizer ordered by my uncle were nothing special. This belittling style of service may work well for him in the short term, since he'll wring more money out of customers who are mostly tourists, but I can't imagine people returning.",

The one star is because the owner/head chef is...quite honestly...volatile, short tempered, and incredibly rude. We watched him have a screaming match with one of his own employees (who was maybe only 20), continually and repeatedly degrade his female employees; speak down to them, and generally unpleasant to be around.  He was quite lovely to us, which made the switch shocking. We felt obliged to mention our disappointment to him over his treatment of his employees. Honestly, it left such a bad taste in our mouth and ruined our entire meal and experience here. If I\u2019m spending money at your institution, I need to know that your ethics, your treatment of employees, and the vibe you cultivate is one of openness and kindness. Will not come here again.",

He was super rude to his workers and embarrassed them in-front of the whole restaurant. He was taking shots with costumers and was being obnoxious. We had to send our food back twice. The couple seated next to us left because of how disrespectful he was to them. He kept petting my head and touching our hands in a very uncomfortable way. I had so much anxiety the whole time. He kept making rude and snark comments to us since we did not like what he brought us and were not finishing the dishes. There were children present in the restaurant while all this was happening. Two waitresses came up to us and apologized on behalf of his behavior with the excuse of \u201che\u2019s drunk\u201d. This is 100% not acceptable. I do not recommend to anyone.

I believe he is aiming for a culinary experience but it was not advertised as such and as we entered with specific desired food for dinner, we were quite annoyed that an hour and a half after our reservation we still were not allowed to order food we wanted and were served dishes blindly with no information.

He'll then ask what your preferences and omissions are, if any, and your spiciness tolerance. After a few minutes you'll get the first course of a multi-course meal catered specifically to you!  EVERYTHING is delicious! The meals are not greasy at all, nor are they very heavy in the stomach. You finish your meal perfectly satisfied by the end; never left hungry and no wasted food for about $75 for two people, depending on what is served.  The wait staff are very kind and share the same familial-relationship atmosphere that Opal exudes while still displaying professionalism.  This place is nearly constantly busy and there really is little wonder as to why. It is absolutely recommended to call ahead for a reservation. There is a paid parking lot directly across the street, but it's hours vary so be aware you may have to park at one of the other paid parking lots nearby.  If it's not clear by now, I simply cannot recommend this place enough! It's certainly a must-visit while you're on the island.",

The owner will then ask what sorts of protein and flavors the guests prefer. Food allergies and preferences will also be taken into account. The owner (Opal, I assume?) will bring you a number of dishes that fit the tables preferences. They will vary in flavor and texture. It is not a lot of food, not like typical restaurants that load up, but it is extremely filling. It is also a bit pricey, with each dish upwards of $10, but below $20. All in all, it is a fantastic restaurant, and one everybody should visit at least once in their life.  P.S. I gave it a four star review because of the price. Everything was one the pricey-er end.

You will be prepared some tasty dishes that align with the things you talked about with the chef and/or waiter.  If you are on a budget, you should probably say that up front because you won't have control over what comes out of the kitchen for you.  It seems like they keep things reasonable though.

Opal, the owner, is friendly and greets all his customers. For first timers, he'll ask if you've eaten Thai food before and to name a few dishes. He'll also ask if you have any allergies, dislikes and your spice tolerance. This is his process for figuring out what dishes to bring to the table.  I recommend coming with a group of 4-6 people and factor in 1.5 to 2 hours for your meal. For regular customers, you have the option to order off the menu but when I bring my friends here, I let Opal create the whole menu. There hasn't been a dish I don't like and I always let him know in the beginning that I don't like curry. My friends still get to try a curry dish but Opal will say, \"I have something else coming for you.\" The atmosphere in here is lively and the staff are attentive. The menu is a bit on the pricey side but the food taste delicious and the portions are decent. If you are coming with a group, you should make reservations a few days in advance. For parking, there is metered parking along Smith Street and a parking structure in Marin Tower; on the next block.",

        "caption": "This Thai restaurant is upbeat and supper fresh with flavors, presentation, and style.  It isn't your typical Thai restaurant that seems to have the same repetitive format wherever you go.  What makes it really standout other then what is most important, the food, is the interaction with the staff.  From the moment you walk in, it is very friendly and attentive. There were two young hosts/servers working which by their age appearance I would guess are family members of the owner.  He obviously has trained them well with connecting with customers and giving good service with a genuine smile.  Although he didn't introduce himself as the owner/operator, a gentleman immediately approached our table and took our menus away. At first we were like a bit \"WTH\", but then quickly realized once he started interacting with us and talking about what we think Thai food is and the flavors we prefer, we became comfortable and allowed him to order for us.  What a great decision to put our palates in his hands.  First we were a bit concerned we would end up with food that we had no desire to eat, but quickly were in food heaven and then eventually a food coma.  Everything was tasty, fresh, and beautifully plated.  The crispy rice salad starter was something we had never had before and offered a light and refreshing beginning to more things to come.  There was also something that arrived that didn't appear on the menu that was called Special Cake on the bill that was amazing.  I think it was a fishcake that had been pan-fried and served with a saut\u00e9ed bean spout melody that was just incredible. The balance of flavors and textures was perfect.  Next for the mains, we were served a chicken Kao Soy which is like a Thai Laksa and a seafood Tom Yum noodle soup.  Both were vibrant with flavors.  I like spicy and told them so, so they brought their special chili paste to add in addition to the dishes in order to get the right balance without killing the original flavors intended.  Surprisingly, we weren't given a huge bill at the end or pushed to order additional.  It was very affordable and with the quality, probably unexpectedly lower then I had intended to pay.  One grip I have is the design of the location.  At the time of day we came, the sun was still hot on the entry side of the open bay doors.  They need to install fans to keep the air moving inside if they are going to do that, but I did enjoy the openness of it.  Overall we were very happy to eat there and plan to go again. Will recommend it to everyone.",

He was super friendly, asked where we were from, what kind of food we like, etc. He insisted on creating special dishes for us based on our preferences and advised us not to get the typical \"Thai\" dishes.  We were unsure what we wanted to go with and wanted to look through the menu before deciding. At this point, the owner got verbally aggressive and snatched the menu from our hands. He said if we didn't trust him and his personalized dishes then we should just leave. This immediately ruined our mood. Despite this, we decided to stay and go with the special dishes because we wanted to taste the food everyone raved about. The moment we decided to stay was when we finally got water brought to the table...  I was quite disappointed with the dishes. Based on our preferences, I was expecting some noodle dishes and all we got were appetizers and finger foods that I never would have ordered, or would ever order. I didn't go to a Thai restaurant to eat deep fried chicken wings. If you are looking to get the typical \"Thai\" dishes, then I would not recommend going here. I don't even know why they have a menu if the owner gets upset if you suggest ordering from the menu.",

What a mistake that was, the reviews were accurate. Upon being seated and looking at the menu, the owner comes by starts by chatting us up, then removing our menu, he told us he would make us something special. But after viewing the other reviews we decided against it, we just wanted to order our own thing. The owner got defensive and told us to leave the restaurant, if we didn\u2019t want to order his special menu we were told to leave. He humiliated our group in front of all the other patrons. At that point the wise thing would\u2019ve been to leave however we bit the bullet against our better judgment and went for his special menu. What we got in the end was fried chicken wings, some fried rice and other items. Long story short, we were footed with an overly expensive bill for items we didn\u2019t even want to eat. Had we been able to choose our own items off HIS menu, we may have actually enjoyed our experience. If your looking for Thai food, I highly advise to check out another local restaurant. We hope no one else has to go through what we went through at this joke of a restaurant. This is a fair warning to all others looking at this restaurant, be prepared to eat what ever he says. Others experience may be different, this is just our story.",

I asked him if he was vegetarian and he gave me food with course. I could be embarrassed at first. Yes. I also have high fives in a couple of times. Of course, the food is awesome.

It was divine. Then, we had the most amazing garlic, friend basil leaves, yum, eggplant and green beans. The little bitesize eggplant interior melted in my mouth, while the outside was still soft. The sear on the green beans was perfect, the basil leaves were crunchy. The flavor was out of this world on all of these dishes. The chef's son was really nice. We sat at the bar. The waitress made sure I knew how to eat the dishes. I will be back!!!! Thank you, Opal Thai.",

The owner came by and took great care of us, it was a unique dining experience as we were seated and presented with a menu by the host only to have the owner take it away from us moments later. We had a quick and fun conversation with Opal allowing him to gather what we'd like to eat without actually telling us about any of the dishes. He then proceeded to bring out some of the best tasting dishes I have had in a very long time. Even my wife who is fairly picky enjoyed her dishes (she also enjoyed some of my wings until the spiciness kicked in and was too much for her).  Truly an exceptional place as long as you are open to the hospitality. I could see some of my friends not enjoying it as much or requesting something specific.",

Amazing.  Excellent flavors and customization.  Gotta hand it to Opal, he is the man.  His unorthodox approach to ordering may be a surprise to some, but what an amazing experience our lunch was.  Portions are tailored to the number of people and so is the pricing.  Very fair and definitely work the cost.

Please note that if you want a table here, you are going to have to make reservations well in advance (and don't show up late because there is a line of people waiting hungrily to take your spot!).  Now, that being said, you will love this place, and your advance-planning and promptness will be richly rewarded :)  Opal is the friendliest restauranteur that we have met on the island.  He greets you personally with a warm handshake (or fist bump) and he has a peculiar sense of humor that makes the experience all the more unique and refreshing.  Dont bother ordering from the menu.  Just let him take you on an amazing culinary adventure through authentic Thai cuisine that you won't soon forget!",

He forces you to eat food that you haven't ordered and despite of telling him, repeatedly, that you have a particular dish in mind, will not listen and brush you off rudely. He uses this strategy on big families so he can generate a large bill and increase his sales. He comes off extremely forceful, aggressive, ill-mannered and disrespectful to elders in your party and exhibits street side upbringing values and qualities. He castes his image that of a helpless immigrant from Thailand who came to the US with a few bucks and bores you with his broke days and how his mother has taught him to make an honest living which absolutely contradicts his low mannerism and egoistic attitude towards you. When I cornered him to share my awful experience so no one else would have to go through what my family and I did, he started throwing racial rants to me and my family in the presence of other customers that were still dining. He honestly needs a 101 in customer service and satisfaction. Strongly advise to avoid this place and if you're reading this review while there, watch out for the owner's dirty tricks and don't fall for his false humility towards scamming you with a huge bill by forcing you to eat food you weren't planning to order or eat.",

When we asked a waiter the Asian man with a beard to bring some water, surprisingly, he answered that he will bring water to us after he takes order from us and we have to wait. A few minutes later after another waitress brought water to us, this waiter came to our table and asked what are our races.  After we refused to tell him, he told us to get out of the restaurant. OMG. I have not encountered anything like this in my life. I couldn't wait for another second to leave this that place, who knows our food might serve with some nasty flavor if we stayed.

The problem with Opal is, well, Opal himself.  Rude and arrogant, he insists you know nothing about Thai food and will not actually allow you to order what you want.  He tells you what you want. The menu is a farce to make you think has a selection of food, when in reality he has a few select things that he forces you to eat. He puts on a show, pretending like he will make something special for you, and then brings whatever he has on hand is trying to get rid of.  Everybody who walks in gets the same three dishes of his choosing, like it or not.  As a result your Thai dinner for two that would be no more than $30 turns into a $60 bait and switch scam. The location is very cramped, no AC and no bathroom.  Overall a very uncomfortable and truley unpleasant experience.  While this might be described as \"unique\" by those who consider \"eating out\" to be going to McDonald's or Golden Corral, avoid Opals at all cost if you appreciate a nice dining experince and your dignity.  You will leave Opals with neither.",

He does love to shake hands and did fist bump our girls.  He did take our menus away, but we loved everything they brought out to us.  He took into account that I like spicy and our girls do not.  He brought out two larb dishes, one spicy and one not.  Everything he brought us, we loved.  Between 4 of us, we had the two appetizers(Larb), crispy garlic chicken, a dish with wide noodles like pad-see-ew, but not the same, a pineapple curry, sauteed green beans, another dish that he would not say what it was, but it looked like some tofu cakes with bean sprouts (it tasted awsome) and one thai iced coffee.  All this food still only came to $81.  I don't feel we got taken or that he was trying to \"run up the bill\" as other poster have suggested.  All the food was great, some of the best we had and the experience of someone choosing food for you was a welcomed change.  This gave us the opportunity to eat differently than what we would have ordered ourselves.  All this being said, if you are not adventurous at all and only want the \"typical\" american Thai fare, you probably won't like it.  However, if you want a fun experience and great food, you should try it.  We found out they do take reservations, so that would be a good idea.  We did not have reservations and had to wait about an hour.  They took my cell number so we walked around the town and other shops until they called which was perfect.  The owner and all the staff were excellent.  Food and service was 5 star.",

My wife and I were so thankful we stumbled upon this place on google maps.",

        "caption": "Best Thai food I have ever had. And the service is amazing! BYOB and they will give you a bucket of ice to keep your drinks cold throughout the meal. It takes a while to get a table and order, but that is because the owner comes to every single table to get to know you and set up a menu for you. He asked us if we could name 6 Thai dishes (we got 3) and then asked us about seasonings and meats that we liked. He asked about food allergies and heat preference as well. After that the food came out quickly in 5 courses that we all shared. Every single dish was amazingly flavorful. It is cash only but there is an ATM in the same building. Cannot wait to go back!",
