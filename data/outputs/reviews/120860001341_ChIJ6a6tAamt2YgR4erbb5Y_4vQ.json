The good was great, the service was impeccable, and the drinks were strong. We had such an incredible meal.  We began with the choose 3 platter. We chose the hummus, tatziki, and red pepper hummus. I have a gluten allergy so they included some cucumber. We had the scallop carpaccio and it was incredible! We had the sea bass for our main course with the roasted beets and potatoes. We also had the octopus. Delish! I\u2019d go here again!",

The first time I dined here, I made a reservation ahead of time, and while they couldn't accommodate me for a table outside, the bar was very inviting. We fully enjoyed all of our dishes. My girlfriend and I ordered the trio of spreads, little gem salad, zucchini chips, sea bass, and orzo side. The fish stood out to me with the light char of the wood grilled oven, and the very moist and flavorful firm flesh. Service was excellent! The second time I dined there was without a reservation, for a date night with my man, on a busy Saturday night. The bar area was spaced out, and very comfortable, about two seats between parties. I felt very comfortable without a mask on while eating at the bar, as the windows are open and the space feels airy. The service at the bar was wonderful, and very upbeat. They were very attentive, and friendly. Overall, two consistently very wonderful visits to this gem in Aventura. Make sure to book ahead, and request indoors or outdoors in your reservation. It's a wonderful spot!",

My wife ordered the steak and I ordered the lemon chicken. I am iron intolerant so I was a bit surprised when the one in front of me, when I bit into it, was the steak and hers was the chicken. their staff need to take food deliveries a bit more seriously especially when dietary constraints are to be considered. you can only have a happy hour at the bar and of course there is limited seating because of current conditions. The happy hour is only 2 hours from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.. The gyro that we got was $12 and the price did not change if it was steak or chicken period in my opinion the steak is a good value but some of it was a little bit fatty and chewy and not thinly sliced. You can see the size of the gyro in the picture of this review.",

If you are looking for Greek food , forget about that , they have the name but the food is far from Greek food.
