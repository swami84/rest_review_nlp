Every time they go to their mouths, they always keep their homes cheap and full of weight. In fact, they are very tricky! Do business or honestly, don't be smart! I am sure that they left the food left by the guests without dumping them, cooking them again to other guests, judging by the color and taste of the food (I worked in the restaurant for 20 years)...
