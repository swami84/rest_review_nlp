Ilma (our server) graciously obliged our request to serve us to her recommendations. She suggested small portion courses for my fiancee and I to share. This gave us the luxury of tasting the best they had to offer. The best is what it was! Far exceeding our expectations. A lesson in gastronomy nirvana.  Every course was perfectly paired with individual wines.  Salumi & cheese, olives, homemade focaccia with olive oil,  midollo (roasted marrow bone oxtail) was life changing! 4 Homemade pasta dishes that made my socks roll up and down! Ilma's service was impeccable to say the least! If you are looking for authenticity in cuisine that will teleport you to Italy,  this is the place! I will sing the praises of piccolo as being hands down, the best dining experience I have ever had the good fortune of experiencing! Thank you Ilma! Hats off to the chef! The divinity of your culinary creations is the best you will ever find in Portland! Carlos & Vlasta",

Changed the time to 7:30 pm due to work issues . My husband and I  stopped off at another restaurant for a drink and an appetizer before we arrived at Piccolo because we were famished. When we arrived, they sat us right down to a small table next to the entrance door . The waitress was very pleasant and handed us our menu for that night .We were informed of a 6 course tasting for that evening.  I was not informed at either times when I made reservations that there was a 6 course tasting menu for that night ONLY.  My first extinct was to get up and go to another restaurant . Well we stayed and the Tasting was ok, but not WORTH $75 per person . We left Piccolos still hungry . Very upset that I was not informed of the tasting , especially at $75 person . My husband and I spent $195 for 2 tastings and a bottle of wine . We could have gone to Fore Street , Street Company or another great Restaurant in the Old Port and have eaten like a King . Not impressed .",
