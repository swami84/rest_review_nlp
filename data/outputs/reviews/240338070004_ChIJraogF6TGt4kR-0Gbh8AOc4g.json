We reached out to them at the start of the pandemic about purchasing games from them. They were very responsive and we arranged a pickup. At the pickup they also lent us another game for free that our kids could play. It was an amazing and thoughtful gesture that my family has not forgotten.",

I am only giving three stars because they only had one red wine as an option and no open bar, I was really hoping to get an espresso martini.

It's not hard to find, as it's facing the road (but parking is pretty much exclusively paid in a garage attached to the rear of the building, just FYI).  The place has a modern, thoughtful layout. There are large windows up front for those that want daylight, and a dimmer area in the back if you're not feeling the sunshine. The many shelves are lined with games for every type of tabletop experience. There are different seating options, tables with chairs or couches and armchairs. The bathrooms have chalkboard walls to write on, which is so unique!  There are so, so many board games to try. The price for unlimited play is fair but varies based on the time of day. You don't have to pay the fee if you bring your own game though, which is cool! You can also buy board games, art on the walls, and trading card boosters. My husband and I played MtG Commander that we'd brought along, and didn't feel like we were scrutinized for the choice to play our own game.  Food and drink-wise, everything is pretty standardly priced for a specialized cafe. In the drink department, they sell select sodas, teas, coffee drinks, and alcoholic beverages. As far as food, they've got restaurant-fare entrees, smaller plates, appetizers, and snacks. We loved their Oreo milkshake and orange float, as well as their pretzel bites(those dips were killer!).  During our experience, the atmosphere was fun, friendly, and relaxed. Our server Sam was so welcoming and attentive. One of the owners stopped by our table to chat and definitely seems to love his business as much as he loves his customers.  Overall, this was a great experience. We hope to come back within a few months as we're from out of town, but boy do we wish we could go every day!",

Beyond that there are issues. The food ranges from fine to gross and is often over priced for what you get. My friends and I have solved that by just eating before hand whenever we go. Their \"game gurus\" are another issue for me. Usually very annoying and socially inept. I dont like getting bombarded whenever I'm seen reading the rules for a game, only to have the guru spend the same amount of time reading the rules to try and explain it to me. I understand having the guru as a resource available, but right now they are intrusive and annoying. One, the guy with a mohawk and a beard, actually made fun of me for seeing me have the rulebook open for reference while we played. Did not appreciate that.

We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday night and were able to get a table no problem. We paid $5 per person (under 10 free) to play games till 1am. They have every game you can think of and more. It's an organized and efficient system. We're took a break from playing games to eat some burgers, which were good. The Old Bay fries and pretzel bites were our favorite. The service was good and no one rushed us. Recommend giving it a try if you enjoy playing games.",

I would be more willing to make this a regular hang out spot for my friends and I if they improved these things and/or maybe allowed people to bring their own games.

Before we went on Tuesday, I double checked this on the website and it verified that on Tuesday gaming would be free if we spent $12 or more on food or drinks.  (Image of their website is attached to review).  But the waitress on Tuesday told us they changed this recently and they would not honor it.  I said, \"even if it's still on your website\"?  She said, \"no, we don't do it anymore, we just haven't updated the site yet\".  She didn't go ask the manager if they'd honor it since they're still advertising it or anything.  It didn't ruin our night.  We still played games, and had food and drinks.  But it's super misleading and dishonest to not honor an advertisement that brought us in.  Again, the waitress on Monday said it was for both days.  The waitress on Tuesday said the first waitress and the website we're wrong and charged us for games.  I'm attempting to upload an image of the website showing the Monday/Tuesday deal, but it doesn't seem to want to accept the file.  If Board and Brew would like to contact me about this experience, i'd be happy to send them the image, if it doesn't post here.",

Come in with friends, pay a $5 cover and choose one of their hundreds of awesome and unique board games to play, with no limit on which games or play time. And while you play you can eat lunch/dinner or drink gourmet specialized coffee/tea or some other hand made drink.  Unfortunately the execution of this idea was bad enough to make the overall experience unpleasant. I will not come back here on my own. If someone else hosts an event here, I'll reluctantly come, but I won't bring my friends here.  The coffee I ordered came out barely above lukewarm. The food orders for our table came out so haphazardly that it was awkward to try and play the games, and it was also awkward to eat, being one of only a few people that had food. I ordered way after my event's host and I ordered at the same time as my wife (who ordered a salad). My food came out before almost everyone else's. My host didn't get his food until almost an hour after I got mine. My wife's salad came out waay after my fries and sandwich, both of which required more preparation than her salad. I ended up not actually eating my sandwich out of politeness to those who hadn't gotten their food yet. And the appetizers? Those came out AFTER everyone's actual dinner. I also ordered a fountain root beer soda, and I'm fairly certain they had to go find the roots at a local farm and squeeze them into a cup in order to get it to me because it took an exorbitantly long amount of time to get it. You have to make a special request for straws here. I'm also pretty sure they had to import the plastic, cut and roll it and then wrap it in the paper before it could get to me. Took so long to get a straw I almost made the waitress take the drink off the bill.  When you combine this experience with how difficult the place is to get into and out of due to limited parking and heavy traffic in the area, it makes the trip (a 40 minute drive from my house) not well worth it.  My wife also noted that because of the $5 cover charge, the business made more than $45 from our table just for simple privilege of playing a few rounds of Apples to Apples.",

The fries were cold. The chicken pesto was soggy and stale, which is a weird combo to eat. The croutons in the salad were stale. The service was very good! The atmosphere was VERY loud.  I feel like, if they don't get more kitchen staff and continue with the long waits for food then the board games should be free to play.  Honestly, if not for the wait I would have given a 4 star.",

EDIT: To expand on specifics, our table ordered two plates of pickle chips, some pretzel bites, mac and cheese and a cold soup.  The pickle chips were unusual in that they were corn breaded, but were quite good. The Cold Soup was interesting, a good adventure that was extremely not standard faire. The pretzel bites were not bad, but not necessarily cuisine. Sorta what you might expect. The Mac and cheese was mediocre, and while we did have fun playing pandemic, we were suggested a 2nd game by our game guru who gave us a game where 2 out of 4 of us were dead in the game by turn 3. Additionally, we rarely saw our waitress, not to try to pile it on.  Do I think it was all Board and Brews fault? Of course not, but an overall not fantastic experience was made worse by the pricing, that's all. A good place to try a beer and do a board game, but maybe skip dinner is my advice. That, or maybe avoid the appetizers menu? Unsure of the solution here, I just know our experience could've been better.",

        "caption": "Three stars is a compromise here.  There are reasons that it should be higher and reasons that it should be lower.  I'm not sure if it's because UMCP is out for the summer or what, but the hours posted on the website and on the Google maps entry are wrong.  My wife and a friend came in to eat, drink, and play a game.  It was only a little after 10:00 when we went in and the website said that Board and Brew was open until 1:00 AM so we thought we had plenty of time.  We ordered a round of drinks and some foods (sliders, old bay fries, and pickle chips) that came out in a reasonable amount of time and were all tasty and appropriately priced!  The selection of games is quite large and the $5 charge per person to play seemed affordable.  We picked a game that we haven't played before but is closely related to one that we have at home and ordered another round.  We were going through the rules and the owner came over when he saw we were checking through the rulebook to give us some examples to clarify the ways that this game differed from the one we were used to.  We started playing the game and picked it up quickly and were having a good time.  Our waitress took a 20-30 minute or so break after 11:00 to eat, which we didn't have a problem with, but at 11:45 one of the wait staff came and asked if we wanted another round of drinks.  He informed us that they were closing in 15 minutes, which was a surprise but we took this to mean that this was last call for placing an order.  Five minutes later our waitress came up to ask if we needed anything else and to let us know that they were closing in 9 minutes but that \"we could keep playing until then!\"  It was frustrating after having her attention for half an hour or so less than an hour before close!  Really her going on break to eat had indicated that they were going to be open for a while longer!  So not only are the hours posted on the website and on Google maps wrong, but the closing time isn't just a cutoff for being served.  You have to literally stop playing and leave at closing time.  We had to quit about 10-15 minutes before finishing.  If we had understood this beforehand we probably wouldn't have paid the $15!  I'm new in the area, but I can't say that I've seen a bar that didn't just stop serving at closing time, but actually asked patrons to leave.  I would be more understanding if we were in the middle of Hogwarts Battle or Arkham Horror or something else that takes hours to play.  We appreciated the owner clarifying some rules, but he made no mention of the closing time to warn us that we might not finish!  All in all, this could have been a five star review if 1. the hours on the internet reflected reality - this should be an easy thing to adjust! 2. the rule that closing time = patrons have to leave was advertised anywhere. 3. we had any warning that we might not be able to finish the game that we effectively paid $15 to play. 4. we hadn't been without service for 25 minutes or so before being told twice within 5 minutes that we would have to leave in 15/10 minutes.",

The entire menu is mostly oriented towards a small meal or light snack so don't expect to fill up on just 1 portion. Lots of tables for eating/snacking, studying with power outlets, and couches for playing board games.They even offer unlimited board games for a small fee which allows you to indulge in their massive selection with hundreds of individual sets to play with your friends. While the ambiance is perfect, food was tasty as long as the expectation that it's not a massive meal is in place, service could be better. We ordered some food which was not sent to the kitchen so it was over an hour before we received what we ordered. Water cups sat empty for long stretches at a time. Thankfully the owner is extremely competent and apologetic and comped our food costs due to the delay which wasn't necessary but extremely impressed.

At first it felt like, \"what am I doing here\", but it got better after sitting down and getting to the games. The selection of games is AMAZING, though some games really look like they've been through it all. I wonder I'd they have a classic deck of cards. The music choice is different from what you hear of the radio these days, but it feels like a nice blast to the early 2000's, when alternative rock was the thing.  So it's $5 just to play the games, which is alright if you have time to spend hours playing games and get the most out of your money. I do not suggest this place if you just want to play a quick round. The food prices are pretty outrageous if you ask me. My suggestion: eat before you  come here. I had a problem with my order. My friend order the 3 sliders, which came with ketchup and we're in normal slider buns. I ordered the same thing a couple minutes later, but mine was a normal hamburger sliced into 3 pieces. Mine had tomatoes, but no ketchup. It tasted extremely dry and after two, I had to call and ask for ketchup, which surprisingly was still in stock. I wonder what happened with my order. The service was really nice though.",
