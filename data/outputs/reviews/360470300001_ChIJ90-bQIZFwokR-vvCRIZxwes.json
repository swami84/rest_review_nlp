I wish there were more veggies besides cucumbers and daikon but overall not bad. There was a lot of meat and it was dark meat so even better! The spring rolls were ok. Not the worst, not the best.

Decided on the Bun Bo Hue (small) and I was a bit disappointed upon taste.  Although it looked really good, I found the soup under seasoned and lacked heat a Bun Bo Hue should have.  The pigs feet was very tender, but also lacked seasoning.  Overall, had hoped for a flavorful bowl of Bun Bo Hue, but ended up with a bland taste in the mouth. On the plus side, the waiter was friendly and professional.",

That is why I was really excited when I heard that a new Vietnamese place opened up that served Bun Bo Hue as their specialty!  I was not disappointed! The noodles were fantastic! I have tried Bun Bo Hue Noodles at other Vietnamese restaurants, but this restaurant had its own delicious take on it. Not to mention it is very inexpensive!  The broth was delicious~ I ended up finishing almost all of the soup. I also really liked the noodles. But the best part of the bowl of soup was the pig blood! Not a lot of Vietnamese restaurants serve pig blood with their noodle soups. That made me really happy. The beef and beef bones served with the noodles were really good.  My friend got the vermicelli pork bowl and she said it was great.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was light and pretty. They have free candy at the front.  The food was also really inexpensive which was nice. I will come again.",

Their menu consists of a few... dishes (around 6?) Their signature noodle dish was interesting... spicy noodle with pig blood, pig feet and .... other stuff. Wasnt bad, but interesting. (A little pricey too tbh)..\ud83d\ude36 I got their beef noodle soup since they said it is the same as the usual special beef pho at other Viet places. It was ok, the broth was quite flavorful, but some of the beef was a little overcooked. Their chicken pho was pretty good on the other hand. The broth was very clear and the chicken taste was good. \ud83d\udc4c Spring rolls was... ok. (I prefer the ones I had at other restaurnts...) Overall, the place was ok, hopefully they can maybe increase their menu a little...\ud83d\ude05",

The main dish Bun Thit Nurong also contains meat. She said they could make it without meat, which they did and it was very good. We also had their Signature drink which was very tasty. It reminded me of bubble tea, but it contained jelled fruit and chia seeds. When I am in that neighborhood again, I will definitely go back to that restaurant.",
