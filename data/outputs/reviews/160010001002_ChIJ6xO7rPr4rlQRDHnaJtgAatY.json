Our server was absolutely darling & fantastic.  However,  the food was disappointing to me. My chicken in my soup was rubber.  My salad was great but my entree just needed some enchilada sauce.  I ordered gfree sweet potato enchilada. Great idea, needs enchilada sauce.  The quinoi salad is a great idea.  Not sure too many  people would enjoy but good thought.  My husband ordered Kimchi fries. I guess they were so dry he would not even take them home to my kids.   We will come back but please pay attention to the main ingredients in your food & make sure they are cooked correctly.   We rarely get to have lunch together so a little sad that it wasn't fantastic.  Please visit this restaurant, I am confident all the non gluten free is amazing!!!",

Between my two friends and me we had blueberry mojito, thai basil martini, a jalepeno/cucumber beverage and craft beers. I had street tacos and chips with guacamole and salsa, again ALL made from scratch while they had chowder and a BLT with hand cut fries (yum!). Would recommend this place and can't wait to return and try other fresh entrees.",

I honestly had to hold myself back from ordering a second one!  The drink mixes were unique and very flavorful, and the atmosphere is what really sold the place.  Live music performed by a very talented musician had me singing along happily with what they were playing while I ate in a soft window.  So worth the visit!",

The mac and cheese was bland and also seemed to be pricey for what was served.  Cocktails were very good and beer selection is ample as well.

Our server and the hostess were both told that there was a birthday. My husband ordered a signature cocktail off the menu, which was a take on an Irish coffee. The drink came with just a cinnamon tequila and coffee... he took the drink to the bar to get it corrected, where the bartender argued with him about what was in the drink. He then had to look at the menu to make the drink correctly. The server then also argued about what was in the drink and left the table to check the menu! He came back and said it was a new menu and so he wasn\u2019t familiar. No apologies, nothing. We were then charged an 18% automatic gratuity for only 7 people. To top it off, the food was all very mediocre. We will not be returning.",

This is the 124th Yelp review for Solid Grill and Bar, downtown Boise, next to Liquid (fitting), the Knitting Factory, and much more! This is my 426th review on Yelp.  I've been here three times and each time I had a 5-star experience.  This particular visit was led by fate as was who I was with. The quote above is, in essence, my motto for YELP and sets the tone for this review.  After a yelp event, My Yelp friend turned real-life friend Chanda and her friend went looking for a place to eat.  Someone saw us walking by and suggested that we eat at Solid. I am so glad we did!  We walked in and were seated on the patio. There we saw my Yelpie Dani (again, good things happen when you meet strangers, right), and her dining companion. The music was so beautiful and I quickly realized that it was a person singing LIVE! What a treat!  The food was super good as well. I got the Portabello burger (mushroom in place of meat) with onion rings. My dining companions got risotto bites and a hummus platter. A full bar with a bartender that knows how to mix a drink, reasonable prices (especially for the location) and a superb atmosphere!  Then our Yelp ambassador here in Boise, Amie, walked in, with her beautiful smile! All these friendly strangers eating at the same place seems like a touch of fate to me, or perhaps a few shots of coincidence and technology, but I choose fate. What do you chose?",

We all enjoyed our food and the wait for the food was average. The server could have been more attentive- he never refilled our drinks or checked in, but I understand that it was a busy Friday night.
