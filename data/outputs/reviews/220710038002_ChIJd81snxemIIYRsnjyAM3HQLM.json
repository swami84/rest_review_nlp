I would have added salt myself, but both salt and pepper grinders at our table were empty and I assume were for display only.  The restaurant is very cozy.  It was difficult for my wife and I to converse during our meal without constantly asking the other to repeat themself.  Our server was very attentive, professional, polite, and personable.

I understand that restaurants are busy on New Year's Eve, however the point of a reservation is to make sure your customers aren't standing outside 55 min past their set time. It is kind of contradicting that they take your card so they can bill you if you are late but they did not even have the courtesy to call you to let us know they were running behind. Once inside the manager promised to make it up to us but never even came to check on our table. We also called in advance to let them know we had a vegetarian guest coming with us and they said they would accommodate to her. She received a plate full of raw vegetables in replace of the normal options (filet steak or grouper). Not to mention the lack of any type of seasoning (not even salt or pepper) on the vegetables. I had ordered the filet for my main course. They ask how you would like it cooked and I said medium. They proceeded to give me 2 raw filets and then I asked for them to just put the 2nd filet back on for a second and then it was brought out burnt. ( I would have eaten it well done but it was to a crisp). At this point we were done and wanted to leave and the check still came out to almost $800. (So nothing was taken \"care of\" like the manger had promised). All in all food was good when they put effort in. At some point management needs to do their job and accommodate. This is probably a Great restaurant when it is not busy and they have another manager on duty. We had all worked in the service industry before so we know lack of effort when we see it.",

Unfortunately not many top rated restaurants offer outdoor dining options. But so glad The Italian Barrel did. Their house salad and dressing were a wonderful starter and a very welcome change from the heavy, oily and carb-laden food we have been presented with these past few days. We had the lasagna and chicken parmigiana with saut\u00e9ed Brussels sprout & pancetta on the side, with a little espresso and Tartufo al limoncello as dessert. Our very excellent server Kendall was professional, courteous, and attentive. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the romantic table-setting with small table heater and had a wonderful meal. The warm bread with olive oil and vinegar were a lovely start to the meal, and I wished I didn\u2019t eat so much of it because the portions that followed were generous. Definitely need to return to try the veal meatball spaghetti and tiramisu as the restaurant ran out from serving New Year\u2019s Eve patrons the night before. Thanks for a lovely evening.",

I love musssels and always get them when available; these were very bland and unimpressive for $20. We decided not to order anything else.

It's not that there are not great Italian spots in NOLA,  but I've found none that match the delicate layering of flavors like Italian Barrel. Wine list can satisfy even the most discriminating sommelier.  And if you like desert, you will be back, time and again, to indulge in old favorites, and creative adaptations of classic italian treats.

        "caption": "I will start off by saying my standards are very high when it comes to Italian food, perhaps more so than the average person. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars so I settled on 3 because of the service.  First off, we had reservations, we were seated promptly for being about 15 minutes early. The noise level does get a bit loud when this place gets busy, and many tables are closer to each other than I would prefer prior to the virus recommendations. The table setting was nice but we never had our lantern lit when it got dark and this would have been nice.  We had the veal meatball for an appetizer, it is quite small for the price, and not sure how more than 2 people could share it. For me it tasted old, or frozen, it wasn't full of flavor from spices, but the sauce was great. The bread was not very good, no matter how much olive oil and balsamic you put on it. It was odd to see this kind of sliced bread at an Italian restaurant, tasted very much like ordinary bread from the grocery store baked in an oven to give the impression it was freshly made.  My daughter had the lasagna, she said it was good, but it was ordinary in look and flavor to me. Again to me it tasted fairly old and was being covered up with sauce to make it seem fresh.  For me I had the chicken parmigiana and it was very old dry chicken, that had a slice of mozzarella added to the top that didn't help hide the dryness and age of the chicken.  Personally I felt most of the meal was frozen recooked food, and the quality didn't come close to matching their menu prices. Was it better than Olive Garden, you bet, but not by much. Cheers!",

However, our experience yesterday was incredibly disappointing, which has never happened here. The service, as always, was friendly, but the staff seemed inexperienced or ill-equipped to deal with problems. Two out of three dishes arrived cold, but the veal was the coldest. When we told our server, he took the plate, only to bring it back moments later, microwaved with the garnish still on top. Even microwaved, the veal was still fridge cold in the middle and my mom couldn\u2019t eat it. The server came by, asked how her meal was, and she politely told him it was still too cold. He didn\u2019t do anything about it or rectify it on the bill.  The chicken parmesan our other table member ate was way too dry, tough, and cold, which again, hasn\u2019t happened before so he was very disappointed. The waiter poured our second bottle of wine without offering a tasting of it first, which shouldn\u2019t be done at this quality of restaurant. The waiter just seemed to have an \u201cOh, sorry\u201d attitude about the food, but never offered to do anything else about the cold plates. I think microwaving a plate that\u2019s already been cut into is gross as it is, and I don\u2019t know if our food was cold because it wasn\u2019t freshly made.  Again, we love this restaurant and are disappointed in this experience. Hoping that by writing a review, changes can be made. It\u2019ll take some convincing next time to bring my family again because of how this dinner was. It was definitely uncharacteristic for this restaurant.",

It was very costly and when you are spending that sort of money you expect good service. It was so bad we had to get a pitcher of water ourself to pour our own water. As I said , if it were reasonably priced I may have overlooked.  The waiter was also extremely rude and dismissive while spilling the bottle of wine as he poured. The aperol spritz was awful!  So bad that I had to send it back which is something I\u2019ve maybe only once before.  The gratuity was automatically added  as we had a party of 5, which probably explains the atrocious service.

We then waited until 10:25 pm, when a couple (that sat at the table 30 mins after us) sitting opposite us got their food before us, we asked the waiter where our food was, she said it was coming, we waited for another 15 mins and decided that after an hour and a half of wait and considering the time (10:30 pm) we weren\u2019t going to wait any longer as we weren\u2019t hungry anymore and quite frankly annoyed at the service. We then asked for the bill to which they laughed and said that we are rude. The manager couldn\u2019t handle the situation and kept ignoring us. I have never experienced anything like that. We ended up leaving without eating our mains. This is the service you will get if you ever step into that restaurant. Highly recommend not to make the same mistake as us.",

Our server and her peers exuded genuine enthusiasm about the food, were docent quality informed about the menu, and made us feel like honored guests. She completely embodies the atmosphere of an upscale intimate setting.  The food is of a unique aesthetic, and may not be the right fit for some who have been feasting on the heavily salted and seasoned fare of other NOLA restaurants. The flavors are nuanced and subtle. The ingredients are clearly high quality and the chef has a very distinct style though.  I ordered the special fettuccine with an osso buco red sauce. It was delicious, but the meat sauce to pasta ratio was off and I could have used about 50% more sauce. My partner had the lasagna and I\u2019m assuming the ground meat used was very lean as the texture was not as rich as I would expect. The best dish at the table was the veal chop, cooked perfectly to really bring out the natural flavor of the veal.  For dessert I will always get a tiramisu. It was not overly sweet, which I expected and honestly was refreshing, but it was soggier than I\u2019d like. Our friends had the limoncello dessert and it tasted freezer-burned.  That said, chef Samantha\u2019s intent comes across clearly and if you\u2019re open to letting down your food guard and embracing an artist\u2019s vision, give this place a try.",

We made a reservation only about thirty minutes before, and when we arrived a little early, they were still able to seat us right away. Had the Italia salad, which featured fresh imported Bufula Mozzarella! Yum! Wife had the Pene Alla vodka, which was delightful, and had plenty of fresh crab. I thoroughly enjoyed the Pene Alla ariabiatta, which had a great balance of spice and sweetness! Wine suggestions from our waitress were perfect, and unfortunately, we were too stuffed for dessert. Also loved the fact that we were so close to Frenchmen Street, so were able to walk down the street to see awesome music.",

My bridesmaid & friend (who is a white woman) & I (a black woman) went to \"The Italian Barrel\" for dinner and right away we were treated with such disrespect. We were greeted by a waitress who before seating us gave us a LONG look up & down from our heads to our toes & then asked if we had a reservation. Once we said we didn't, another person, we assume the manager, says \"oh, I have a place for them, put them at table 16\". Mind you, when we get there, there is only 2 tables that are busy, as well as the bar. The had 10 other empty tables. We were taken to the back corner of the restaurant behind a wall. We had to squeeze between the other 2 tables just to get to our table.  Once we did decide to just leave because we were done being treated like trash, they held the door open for us & looked at us as if we were disgusting them with our presence. This weekend is my bachelorette weekend. All we wanted was Italian food but instead we were treated disgustingly. We were not sure if it was because of my skin color, our clothing or the lack of reservation. No matter what it was we are paying customers and should have been treated with nothing but respect.  We ended up walking down the street to this much more affordable restaurant called \"Mona Lisa\" and we were both treated with nothing but respect. Don't waste your time or money at a rude & disrespectful place like the \"The Italian Barrel\".",

After calling on a week night, we needed a reservation for 3. One of those 3 was my infant child at the time. The host shot me a time around 9:30 because they were \"booked out.\" we decided to show up about 2 hours after we called just to see if the wait was the same and so conveniently there was no wait. We were then seated in the back of the restaurant closest to the server station. Deffinatly tucked away especially since there were no other guests around us. We decided to let it go for the sake of trying the food. The mussels were bland. The pasta dish was basic with no depth of flavor. The dessert that was supposed to blow me away, didn't. All in all, I do not have a problem with dropping that kind of money on dinner. I do have a problem with poor guest service, bland food and being treated like a child because I have one. We will not be back and I wouldn't waste your money.",

After a disappointing meal that cost us $240 - being locals I can tell you the food was most certainly not worth the price - we accidentally left our creditcard behind after paying the bill. When we called the next day to ask if the restaurant had found the card, we were told they had not. However, the Italian Barrel then proceeded to charge the card another $290 that same day we called to inquire... the card was then used at various bars and shops around the French Quarter before we were able to block it. When we called the restaurant to inform them that this had occurred, they were initially apologetic and claimed they would investigate and get back to us, but they never did call us back. I have left my creditcard at a number of establishments in New Orleans - usually from accidentally leaving a bar tab open - and have NEVER had an issue getting it back. I'm absolutely appalled at the behavior of Italian Barrel. Clearly they don't care about their customers or their reputation, so do yourself a favor and go spend your money elsewhere!",

I visited this location with a large party, which was easily handled by a professionally attired and very efficient staff.  We sat outside enjoying the sights and sounds of the French Quarter on one side, and the waterfront behind us.  On the inside was a cozy interior with plenty of patrons, a very neat and tidy presentation within the atmosphere of a deep southern home.  There was not a single meal or glass of wine that did not meet my party's expectations, and costs were on par with similar restaurants in the French Quarter.  If you desire to break into a true Italian experience, this would be an excellent choice.",

Short backstory: I'm here with my bridal party for my bachelorette party and we just wanted a nice Italian dinner for our last night in town considering I'm only in town a short time due to being in the military. The owner of the house we're staying at recommended this place so we decided to give it a try. BIG MISTAKE...just go elsewhere.  When we arrived we were told that we can't do separate checks; okay, that's fine. I think our waitresses name was LeAnne? Not exactly sure. When we asked about payment options, we were told to do cash or use a few different cards...but no actual help. The way we were spoken to just took us aback. Throughout the night we dealt with very passive aggressive attitude, forced smile, not getting all the food we ordered, and empty drink/water glasses...we were treated like trash. One of my girls decided to just pick up the tab; but being from out of town her bank blocked her card until she verified the transaction, so I ended up paying...okay, whatever. But while we were sorting things out and I was getting my card ready to pay, the waitress came over very aggressively and was rushing us. Having been a waitress for many years, I always tip but With that kind of service, I gave a little less than what I would've given if she had treated us like human beings. (And no, we weren't loud, obnoxious, drunk, etc). Then came the icing on the cake...as we were walking out I guess one of my girls didn't close the door well and a guy in a bow tie (host maybe) came and slammed the door closed. A few seconds later, our waitress came out and yelled in from of the restaurant, customers and pretty much all of Decatur St. \"$XX.00?!? REALLY!?!\" and then proceeded to slam the door again!  Never in my life have I been treated this way...as a customer or as a military service member. And the way those people acted in public and towards patrons just validates the amount of tip she received.I will never recommend this place no matter how good the food is. Thank you for making such an important time to me a rude and very upsetting experience.",

I made a reservation on 09/05/16 15:00 hrs. The presentation was great. However, the menu was much pricier then that of what they advertise on line. I had a party of four with two children one was 3 the other was 6. I asked the server for something in red sauce for the children, she suggested the \"penne alla arrabbiata\".  the \"only\" server stated it was fine for children and that the Italian sausage wasn't spicy (on the contrary it was so spicy, that I had to give them my seafood linguini). In addition, the penne pasta was hard and cold as if it was laying out for a long time before serving. my mother ordered the filet mignon, which wasn't, she ended up getting two pieces of veal with a half potato. Both the seafood linguini's had small seafood portions including tiny shrimp (half the size of Walmart's popcorn shrimp). Furthermore, all five dishes were very small in portion and had an average cost of $39.00. The server was not polite, when asking for refills on drinks, she kept bringing small flasks that would only fill up the cup half way. The server left our table unattended for long periods of time with out refills. There also was a very loud fruit cake of a man making loud noises and inappropriate comments in the bar area (talking to the server). When taking my son to the bathroom the stall was on a high concrete slab hard to use and was plugged up so we waited to use the bathroom else where. I hate to throw a business under the bus, but this place had nothing going for it except for it presentation. I hope the owner actually read this. the service and food was horrible, the waiter must have thought her service was so exceptional that she also charged me for a 20 percent tip over $35.00. Overall for a party of four with two children at a cost of $200 plus was not worth it. I will never return.",

The Italian Barrel was started by a native Italian whom journeyed to the United States to support her mother back home. I remember meeting her and believed if there I'd never met a person more down to earth. She's left back home now and sold her place to a new establishment but her spirit and the restaurant's culinary excellence has not left. What was once a small corner restaurant with three tables has now become an extended, refurnished and redone medium-sized restaurant. The French Quarter is represented in the architecture and the spacing is just comfortable enough to fit a good sized party. What makes this restaurant divine is its chef and its food. Each plate is made with love and care. The selections are prime Italian food the way Mother used to make it.  Seafood and pasta. Those are this lovely place's specialty. The dessert mind you has yet to be rivaled by any other location in NOLA apart from the Beignets down the street, even those seem unworthy. I can only hope that when I return, this place does not lose its charm, its eagerness to impress, nor its appeal to those who wish to experience a good serving of Italian food reminiscent of Sicily itself.  Suggestions from the menu: Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Chicken Parmesan (a must-try; two big chicken servings with a healthy dose of fettucine alfredo--it is by far, the only place I will ever eat this dish again), and the Tiramisu",

In anycase, at the last minute, we found this spot close to Frenchmen and decided to eat here. We got seats at about 8pm on Wed night but I highly recommend getting a reservation. Place was small, very cosy and I loved the atmosphere. We tried the special that night which was the Chilean seabass. I swear it was 4 inches thick and just cooked perfectly. Saved room for the chocolate mousse. Everything we had was fantastic and I can only imagine the other items on the menu had we gone back again. Servers and host were very friendly and great.

The Prosciutto was chilled and didn't allow the fat to melt, but that is my only complaint.  It is a very small place and don't try to get up to use the restroom, but who would want to leave the table?  Food was simply fabulous.",
