If we wanted to use 3-4 employees to go get it, we wouldn't have paid for delivery. The employees couldn't locate the car, so they came back up, only to find out the driver called to leave a message saying if we didn't pick it up ASAP he was leaving, since he \"had other deliveries to make.\"  Hmmm.. you were 15 minutes late to ours, so it doesn't seem like time is too important! So we called the store to complain, turns out this rude driver is the OWNER of this location. If this is how he treats customers, then he will never get our business again.
