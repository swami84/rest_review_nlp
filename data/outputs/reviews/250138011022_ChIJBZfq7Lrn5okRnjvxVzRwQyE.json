The veggie burger is great for vegetarians; it's flame-grilled, thick, and satisfying. The veggie burger comes with a special sauce that adds a nice touch. With diced grilled onions inside and that flamed taste, it had me dreaming of cookouts back home.  I'd like to come back to try the desserts. My only complaint is that it's in MGM, so the casino vibe is a bit  overwhelming. The decor feels local-ish, with Massachusetts and even local (Bay State) memorabilia on the walls. But the corporate restaurant feel is present as well, especially since it's inside MGM. Minus one star for not truly being local.",

        "caption": "Very disappointing. My wife and I had tickets to go see Steve Martin and Martin Short at Symphony Hall Thursday night. We decided to go Red Rose as we had a gift card and dont go into Springfield often for dinner. Red Rose was wall to wall people and we knew we wouldn't be able to get the show on time so instead decided to go try one of the restaurants at MGM. This would be our first time at MGM since they opened. We decided on The Tap. We liked the look of it and the atmosphere. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Not bad. Once we sat down we it took a little bit of time for our waitress to get to us as it was busy but not crowded. There were still open seats that we could see around the restaurant. Once she came over, we quickly gave her our order, knowing it might take a while to get to us. I had a swiss cheeseburger, which I ordered medium well when asked by the waitress, and my wife ordered the salmon entree. While we waited we talked and watched some baseball on the numerous TVs they have. It took our order 25 minutes to get to us. My wife checked her salmon and immediately saw that it hadn't be cooked throughly and was raw on the majority of the inside. It looked like it was thrown on the grill for 2 minutes so that only the outside gave the appearance of being cooked. We brought it to the attention of staff and one of the managers came over to return it and get her another entree of salmon. We shared the fries that came with my burger and I waited for her replacement entree to brought out before eating my burger. The maitre d brought out the replacement entree and asked her to check it. Again, the salmon was completely raw on the inside. I bite into my burger and noticed it was cooked well done, not medium well. There was no pink anywhere on the inside of that burger. I told the maitre d I would eat the burger but my wife asked for a bowl of soup instead knowing we needed to leave soon to get to the show. We asked the waitress for the bill and she had to redo it to take the salmon off it, however, we were still charged for her soup, which I found to be surprising and greedy. After not getting an entree not once but twice to be uncooked because theres a \"chef\" that cant cook fish is and then to be charged for the soup to replace the entree because we were out of time was a big slap in the face. This \"chef\" couldn't even cook a burger right. I could've done better on my grill and saved myself the $30 the bill came to for a burger, 2 bowls of soup and 1 soft drink. Needless to say we are very disappointed and will not be returning and will not recommend this restaurant to people. The other thing that I found disappointing and very rude and disrespectful was that this restaurant is located inside MGM which is a major sponsor for the Boston Red Sox and not one tv had the game on for that night. Instead, most of the TVs were showing the New York Yankees. The New York Yankees!!!!! Why not just dump a beverage over my head too just to show how disrespectful this place can be to an area that is primarily Red Sox country. The management of this restaurant are NOT doing their jobs to see that it operates efficiently and respectively to their patrons.",

If you catch this just avoid this place seeing as how they rather hide this places poor food and service then actually try and be better from the over all responses.  Went after the 4th July fireworks in Springfield to get some food with friends and ended up getting sick after ordering thier Reuben. It was the only real meal I ate that day and was sick the rest of the night afterwards. So that how I unfortunately know that's the meal that got me sick. I would say save your money and go elsewhere, there is so many good food/drink options in Springfield.",

I decide to order the 300 dollar bottle of Patron. It takes an hour to arrive to the table with no shot glasses, its 10:30 PM by now. 30 minutes later our server shows up with only six shot glasses, we asked for 12. It takes 15 minutes to being the rest of the shot glasses, its 11:15 PM by now. Our server starts pouring into our shot glasses (because we are not allowed to) and after the 6th shot was poured the 300 dollar bottle of Patron some how slips out of her hands and now is all over the floor. She says sorry and reports to her manager what had happened. This takes about another 30 minutes untill she gets back to us, its 11:45 PM at this point and I ordered the 300 dollar Patron bottle service at 9:30 PM. Since there was about half of the Patron bottle left, the manager said to only give us another bottle of Patron that was half empty. There was no discount or compensation for the ill service we received. Probably would have saved alot of time and money if I just bought shots from the bar.",
