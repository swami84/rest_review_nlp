People seem to ignore the fact that this restaurant is opening in the middle of a pandemic where they have to limit capacity and deal with intermittent complete shutdowns.

To my surprise this man then was standing in the hostess station, so I ask one of the servers if the manager was available and he told me that the owner was there and he pointed to this man, the server told me if I wish to speak to him but I didn't see the point. It's incredible that in covid times people can be so nasty specially the owner. I posted this review on Yelp but it got taken down. Avoid this place.",

The arrogance of this man is terrible. But this doesn't surprise me since my wife's last name isn't Johnson or white sounding she didn't deserve an apology.  He just erased his response to my wife again no apology.  First and last visit to this place, the staff was awesome and the food was ok (minus the egg shells on my burrito). The one star was earn by the owner that after the hostess called our name and take us to out table, he stopped us and said we couldn't seat there because we had a stroller there was no space for it, so we had to wait for a different table. 4 minutes passed and the hostess comes out for us and says table for 6 follow me and shows us were can we park our stroller , so 4 more minutes wasn't so bad. But when we are about to order, he comes to our table and says to my friend  (that's was actually celebrating her birthday) in a very rude manner that she answered to the wrong name and that this wasn't our table and just walked off (they never called her name just came for us and said table for 6). So he didn't need for us to move or anything else, he just wanted to let us know that we did wrong in his eyes. Then this man proceeds to walk around us multiple times very close to our chairs but ignoring us at the same time. In a petty move he goes out of his way to talk and attend the 4 tables around us just the 4 tables around us. We ignored him best we could mainly because we were trying to have a good time, celebrate my friend and because the rest of the staff was super nice, and they were very apologetic because of what he did, so this let's me know that probably they have to deal with his lack of manners too. It's sad that while we try to support local business, specially in this time, the owner is the one that made sure we couldn't have a good time.",

I can't believe it was his staff that apologized, he was throwing bad looks at us the rest of our time there. We are NEVER going back there again. The rest of the staff were nice and apologetic and it looks like this hasn't been the first time it happened. It was a horrible experience and can't recommend this place.",

I almost walked out but it was my friends birthday and the rest of the staff was really nice.  So owner responds my review, with no apology for bad experience. Just to let me know that most of his staff is Hispanic, no surprise there since like I said before rest of the staff was really nice. Your horrible attitude is palpable even true text, the owner in that shift wasn\u2019t Hispanic, but even if he was that doesn\u2019t excuse him from not treating all his customers the same.",

They have creative egg options and skillets and phenomenal French toast and pancakes. Oh and to quote my boyfriend who got the biscuits and gravy, \"these are like the best biscuits I've ever had\" (and he's lived in Louisiana). The atmosphere is great too. Both patio and indoor seating, with  large windows that open up for a nice breeze. If you're looking for a great brunch spot, look no further. We will definitely be back soon!!!",

Ordered the tuna melt another time and it was served completely cold - it wasn't toasted or grilled, the cheese wasn't melted, just a cold sandwich.
