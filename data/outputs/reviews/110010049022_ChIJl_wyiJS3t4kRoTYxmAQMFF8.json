Our waiter answered our questions, offered good recommendations, and was very attentive.  The tasting menu was very filling and worth the price point. Our courses were the cold chili soup, tuna tartare, soft-shelled\u200b crab, pork loin and squash, lamb and spinach, and dessert (chocolate\u200b cake and pistachio bread pudding). All of the dishes were delicious, but the highlights were the pork, lamb, and pistachio bread pudding.  The restaurant\u200b was very nice; we were seated on the second floor and it was nice, quiet, and relatively\u200b private.  Another thing to note is that our reservation was for 7:30 (seated on time) and we left the restaurant slightly after 10, so plan for the tasting menu to take between 2.5 and 3 hours.",

The courses are some sort of derivatives from the actual menu, but in a petite portion. The presentation of each dish is fancy and appetizing. I don't wanna describe too much detailed to ruin the surprises, but complimentary photos are shown with this review for you to get an idea. A little tip: there is an additional bar menu upstairs if you would like a more casual dining experience. They have a three-course tasting menu as well, which is my another recommendation, phenomenal value. You can choose from the bar menu how you want to make up your own three courses.",

The restaurant is very nice and quiet with low lighting, it has a modern look to it. The lady who greeted us was super nice and gave us our Verizon up menus. Then came the server. When she saw we had Verizon up menus she looked not so happy. She never introduced herself. She took our order. I ordered green salad that was great. Then Flat iron steak with mushrooms for main course ( she never asked what sides I wanted when the plate can it had potatoes and green beans on it). I did not want to make a scene but anyway the food was excellent. Kudos to the Chef. Then came dessert it was Pistachio bread pudding, which was delicious. Other then the server being standoffish and  not coming to check on us the restaurant was beautiful and the food was great.",

Appetizers were out quickly but nearly an hour passed before entrees made it out, and it was quite staggered even amongst our own table. Furthermore, we had ordered off a set menu at the start of the meal, but when dessert was being served, we were informed that they were out of one option that several people had ordered. Seems odd to include something on a limited set menu (work event) when you dont have enough in stock.  Finally, on a sweltering day in DC, the AC wasn't working well and the dining area was an oven for the duration of the meal.",

Another patron needed to inquire and have a vegetarian meal made special. I had the lobster carpaccio starter and sea bass main course. The prices are quite expensive and while the food is decent I do not believe it justifies the price. The atmosphere is a bit stuffy given the quality of the food. Waiters constantly removing things (like the bread (?!), glasses and plates). Anyways, I was disappointed after having heard positive things. There are much better options in the area. For 7 people and no alcohol the bill was well over $500 with tip. The restaurant is trying for a fine dining experience but just misses the mark IMHO. It seems they market themselves as a place to be used for impressing a date: expensive, small plates, and 'atmosphere.' Lastly, for beer afficianados, they have a grand total of 6 beers, none of which are of any consequence. Extensive wine list, however. One bottle was listed at $1400.",

Cocktails were very good, the preset menu had a nice selection of choices to choose from. The \"blintz\" was more like a springroll but was tasty. The elk/antelope was cooked as I ordered, medium rare, and the sides were complementary to the meat as a flavor combination. Desserts were good and wine list quality was very good, including by the glass. Usually by the glass selections are poor quality but not so here. Will return for sure.",

Service was a bit slow to begin; not sure why, since there were only a few tables seated, but we weren't in a hurry and didn't mind. If anything it reminded us of eating in Europe a bit.  The drinks were good--nothing particularly amazing, but nothing disappointing, either. I think Del Campo has better cocktails, for instance, but I enjoyed my drinks well enough. I had a Blood Orange 75 (tasty) and a St. Croix Mule (good).  For our dinners we decided to try the Chef's Tasting Menu for $70 each. This turned out to be a little ambitious--you get quite a bit of food, particularly if you start off with the bread and better. (My recommendation would be to skip the bread, if you plan on doing the tasting menu.)  Working from my memory, our dinners consisted of 1) red snapper bisque 2) a tuna tartare with arugula 3) scallops and grits 4) Amish chicken 5) Wagyu beef with spinach and potatoes 6) Flourless chocolate cake / apple tart, both topped with some kind of ice cream  There were interesting flavors, and we really wanted to love our meals, but unfortunately many of the courses were too salty. The bisque was too salty, as was the tuna tartare, as was the scallops. The chicken and the beef were fine, though I wonder if it had to do with our palates shifting by that point. The wagyu beef was simply a nice steak--it was not marbeled beef as I had expected wagyu to be. Tender but not buttery, and as someone who used to live in Japan and had eaten plenty of wagyu, I felt like there was some kind of mislabeling going on.  The ice cream and the cake were good; I wasn't as big a fan of the apple tart.  We had a good time, and we really enjoyed the service, the atmosphere, etc. It's just unfortunate that for the price we paid, we had difficulty enjoying the food.",

This is by far one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in DC, where other restaurants use tasteless GM-ed foods, Corduroy uses locally sourced food. Service was excellent, and it was not noisy at all, with the floor carpeted. Loved the experience!",

It took the waiter 40 minutes to split the check for our table (when we told him at the beginning of our meal service that we were going to be paying separately, so that delay could have been avoided). It turns out that the restaurant still calculates split checks by hand...AND it was done incorrectly in spite of us writing down what each person ordered and to which card it should be charged.  We also found that the restaurant overcharged several of our cards after the fact by about 10%. This was not a service charge issue. For a high end restaurant, this is unacceptable service. If I could, I would take back the tip that we did leave for the hassle that our party has had to endure post-dinner. We will not be returning here. What should have been a 2.5 hour meal for us turned into a 4 hour ordeal.",

        "caption": "Corduroy deserves 3.5 stars in my book.  I truly enjoyed my dinner here, but I believe it was moreso due to the great company that I had.  Service: B-  I arrived on time for our reservation.  The hostess was on the phone and did not bother to acknolwedge my presence.  Finally, she gets off the phone, apologizes and tells me the table was not ready.  I was asked to go to the bar to wait.  10 minutes later, I was escorted to my table.  I found the dining room upstairs to be intimate and cozy.  Our server was nice but seems a bit rusty.  He forgot to give us the cocktail menu, and didn't pay attention to the specific articulated request on how my friend wanted her martini made.  At the end of the meal, he also forgot to bring out coffee for my friend who ordered it.  Appetizer:  -soft shell crab - A I really enjoyed the soft shell crab.  It was delicious! Apparently it was in season so the crab was really fresh.  -lobster carpaccio - B- Our entire table didn't really enjoy the lobster carpaccio.  It was slimy and lacking in flavors.  We all agreed that we couldn't really taste the flavor of the lobster.  Entree:  -Prime Rib - B+ I'm really surprised by my own rating.  I'm usually a meat kind of person and would chose beef over seafood any day.  However, while the prime rib, medium rare, was cooked well, it was a bit tough.  It was enjoyable, but nothing special.  -Rare Big Eye Tuna - A- The tuna was seared perfectly.  It was pink in the middle and super fresh.  -Sea Scallops - A+ The best item of the night was the sea scallops.  It melted in my mouth and paired perfectly with the Sauvignon Blanc that we orderd.  By far, this was the table's favorite for the night.  Desserts:  -Fruit Sorbets - A I don't typically order sorbets but agreed to share some with the table.  The flavors were super refreshing.  -Chocolate Sabayon - B+ I was expecting this to be a warm lava type cake but apparently Sabayon's are more on the dry side.  My disappointment was due to my own incorrect expectations so no fault to the restaurant.  The cake was enjoyable but nothing to write home about.  Overall: I would recommend coming to corduroy if you are looking for some great food and ambiance.  The service is rusty but that's never stopped me from returning to a place.  Dinner took much longer than it should have, so if you have time constraints, remember to remind the server to speed it up a bit.",

While the food was very good, it was overpriced and under-sized in my opinion.  This is the type of place that reinforces the stereotype that \"normal\" people with \"normal\" budgets have of upscale restaurants: little servings of stuff you've never heard of before with price tags high enough to feed a family elsewhere, and a host who almost seems like his job is purely to stroke your ego and convince you this this stuff is actually good (like a used car salesman pitching \"pre-owned\" as though it adds value, or a realtor who describes a cramped apartment as \"cozy\").  Example, a couple of my friends had the scallop tartare: I think there was the \"normal\" meat of one scallop on the plate (the adductor), along with an organ that normally gets thrown out in the US (the roe).  If that organ is garbage a Red Lobster for $10, I doubt it has any more value when you pay $35 to have it served to you raw.  But the foodie reviewers will never admit that.  While my dish (what there was of it) was very good, I could have done just as well myself on the grill at home.  I've just got too much midwestern common sense to get wrapped up in the hype of places like this.  But if somebody else is willing to pay the tab, by all means check it out.",

Sashimi tuna appetizer was incredible as were the seared scallops. Maybe I'm being picky, but the server was distant & mechanical throughout the meal. It wouldn't stop me from going back, but I know that a more engaged server would have inspired me to extend my meal & most likely increase my check.",

Drew was our server for the night and he lacks what you would expect from a place like this, he never came back to check if we were satisfied with our food (which we weren't), nor did anyone care to clean up our table or see if we wanted anything else. After we had to ASK for him to come to the table, he finally asked how it was (once we were already done, too late to ask). He sent the manager to check on us, but obviously there wasn't anything to be done at that point. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience and will never come back to this place. Too bad the staff doesn't really care about their patrons.",

Now for the food. I'm a vegetarian and Corduroy seems to love having meat in everything in a heavy dose. While this aspect is not bad, the vegetarian items that the chef put together were unimaginative and somewhat boring vegetable plate. The chef also offered pasta with mushrooms which every restaurant seems to offer. I would have expected something a bit more substantive. The bread putting was a little dry though the caramel ice cream that came with it was delicious. While the meats may be good, I would not recommend it if you don't want lots of exotic meats.",
