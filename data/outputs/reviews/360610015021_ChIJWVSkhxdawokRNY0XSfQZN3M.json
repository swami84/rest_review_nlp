They only have chinese broccoli for Asian veggies, but steamed with a tasty sauce, though I ask for less of said sauce. Pad see ew noodles maintained their structural integrity (ie not soggy, which seems to happen at some restaurants), chicken soup salty but good, massaman curry came in a huge quart container. For the desserts, chewy and lightly sweet coconut pudding (khanom thuai), and fresh mango sticky rice.  Fan for the quick and kind service, nice portions and flavors, and cheap prices.",

You are seated, and attended to in a timely manner. Welcome to 22 Thai Cuisine. You will enjoy the dining experience here. Menu prices are very competitive for the area, and if your pocket is tight this place should be high on your list. The Tom Yum Chicken Soup is a mildly spicy with chunks of mushroom and a clear broth you'll want to drink to the end. Their See Ew and Pad Thai are excellent options, especially with shrimp. The See Ew has wide, flat noodles with pieces of broccoli and a very present cilantro flavor. The Pad Thai is somewhat sweet and comes with a little less than a tablespoon full of peanut pieces atop the noodles. Their Panang Curry comes with a nice helping of white rice and is between mildly and moderately spicy. It goes well with shrimp as well. In fact, almost all of their dishes match well with their tail-on shrimp, which are large, plump, and flavor-packed. Their seafood section offers sea bass which is flaky and of good texture, but mostly takes on the flavor of the dish you order. You will find that there are many duck options on the menu. I have mixed thoughts about their tofu--the outside is firmer than the inside, which kind of makes it squish in your mouth at first bite. The flavor is typical of tofu and again takes on the flavor of the dish. Portions are sizable. Many of their dishes come with a decorative orange spiral, which turns out to be carrot. It matches the dishes well too. Should you use the restrooms, you will find them fairly small, but clean. Ambiance is very pleasant, somewhat quiet, and almost romantic and classical jazz piano music is often present. If you're looking for nice dining and good food at a low price, definitely visit 22 Thai Cuisine.",

WTH is that????? I'm not much of a complainer but when you serve me batter and chicken skin and try to call it \"friend chicken\" I'm going to get upset. IDC what you say but there was no chicken in my plate. I literally left my whole plate of food after paying for it, I was not offered to try another dish nor did they even apologize. They just basically disagreed with me and said that those are chicken strips. Yeah never again. Definitely lost my business ..... They could of least changed my plate but it was just a waste of money and time. So disappointed",

The lounge area itself was all booked up but for twenty dollars, we were able to secure a seat at the bar. If you plan on sitting in the lounge, make sure you get reservations in advance. Our seats at the bar were quite good to take in the scenery and the music. The bartenders were very nice and quick with service. Food is available, but to be sure, you probably didn't come for the food; if taste is your thing, you'd be better served to try some of the great food available  elsewhere in the village. Not to say that it wasnt good, just adequate. The real reason we were all there, however, was for some really fantastic music. And that's exactly what we got. The sounds were tremendous and even sitting in the bar area, we felt as though we were within inches of the stage. Once the music started, people were either quiet, or were ordering their drinks in a whisper- a true sign of respect for the awesome sounds coming from the stage. The acts change frequently I gather, so I won't comment on the particulars of the various musicians, but I will say that this is first rate talent. About the best music you'll be able to hear in this close and comfortable club. I'll revisit this great place again, to be sure. I'll also call early to get reservations in the main lounge area.",
