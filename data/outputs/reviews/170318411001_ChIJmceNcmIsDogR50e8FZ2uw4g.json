To me, that tells me that this is probably pretty authentic.  Snack planet has a diverse menu with just about anything you could think of that would be stir fried. I've had several dishes here but my most favorite is the stir fried spicy octopus. The dish is spicy and flavorful but not overpowering. The ingredients are simple. Octopus, celery, jalape\u00f1o. It comes with a side of rice. Just simply good food!  They also have a spicy fried crawfish dish that looks heavenly!  Come visit.",
