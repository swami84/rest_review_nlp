Not only is the food exceedingly better then you could imagine but the service and professionalism of the owner and workers are beyond what you could hope for when eating at this truck. I would recommend eating at red roc, booking events, and following this truck. Thank you for your delicious food Chef Hector!",

I ordered the taco salad which they said would be ready in 15 minutes. 40 minutes later I paid $12 for the most disappointing taco salad I have ever had. There was NO lettuce but it was LOADED with cilantro. Had rice in it which was not even listed to be a part of it. What little meat was in it was WAY overdone. It was quite small which didn't really matter since it wasn't edible anyway.",

Be sure to order the shrimp tacos and the chicken tacos- they are absolutely wonderful! Thanks again for everything to Chef Hector and the Red Roc Crew! 5 Stars in my book!  :)",

Several days before our event, while trying to confirm, they did not return calls or emails. Eventually about 4 hours before our event, we reached someone who said he hadn't heard from the employee who was supposed to do our event and he would keep trying to reach him and call us back. Needless to say, no return call, no email, no explanation and no show with 100 hungry people! Even after the fact, no apology, no explanation. That's just poor business despite how good their food may be. Just wanted to share this experience so that others don't make the same mistake.",
