Pizzeria Ora is by far, hands down, THE BEST! We were just walking down the street near our hotel and saw the lunch special sign in the window. $7.95 for a 6\u201d deep dish with soup or salad. We figured, why not? So glad we did! The owner, Walid, is the most genuinely nice person. You can tell he really takes pride in what he has created with Pizzeria Ora. As he should. Our server, Paco, was awesome. Attentive, friendly, and generous. I would recommend this place over any of the big chains any day of the week. We ordered two deep dish 6\u201d pizzas and a 9\u201d thin crust. All were amazing.",

The deep dish now let me tell you something its meat in every bite the marinara sauce on it thick to the taste but dissolves almost immediately. I just wish it was somewhere to really park so I could sit in without paying parking fees that cost almost as much as the pizza...but I literally love this place. Dnt believe me try it for yourself!!

It was the fullest it was ever during my time here and there was only one waitress for the whole place. Her name is Kim and I watched as she bounced from table to table to telephone to keypad and back again. What astonished me is she kept her smile and she remained so pleasant and never complained. This is what customer service is. The mark of a successful business is it being busy. But when it happens, it's the employees that have to deal with the hard part of that. But even in that, there are still the same expectations. Kim showed that. It was obvious that she, like any human would be, was exhausted but you wouldn't know unless you watched the moments she stopped to take a breath before getting back into the cycle. Kim was amazing and I made sure she knew that! Thank you Kim!",

We walked from our hotel about 8 blocks to go to Gino's East side to enjoy a true Chicago Deep Dish pie...but they were closed. So my daughter looked up pizza places near us and we found Pizzeria Ora just 2 blocks away, and decided to give them a try as they had 4.2 stars out of 5 on reviews! Well the minute we walked in we were greeted by our waitres Kim, who was AWESOME, friendly, great service, and funny to boot! We asked what was good for appetizer and she suggested their nachos while we waited and we ordered a large pepperoni and sausage with onions and green peppers and mushroom deep dish pizza! Oh my Lord, it was the BEST deep dish ever and even beat Gino's East side in my opinion! We give Pizzeria Ora a perfect 10! As well as our waitress Kim a perfect 10 as she made it a perfect experience! Thanks Kim and Pizzeria Ora!!! We will be back! I highly recommend everyone to give the deep dish a try! You won't be sorry!! Sincerely, Robert Rosengren",

Definitely recommend it. If you're vegan they do not have vegan cheese but you can ask for your pizza without cheese which is awesome too!

Many available tables, very few guests. Personally I liked it, as we both were kind of tired after a day swimming at Indiana Dunes. Anyways, we ordered our food and drinks: 30 bucks for a medium pizza, a bottle of goose island IPA and a root beer. The food was simply delicious, and the service impeccable. The only thing I can think of that was not A+ was the crust of the pizza, which needed a little more salt/taste. But when you visit, you can probably ask them to salt it up a little. Also, we loved the root beer so much we had to ask our waitress where we could buy it (we're Norwegian tourists visiting Chicago (and the US) for the first time, so we like to ask, not look for ourselves :p) and she told us basically at any grocery store (what a bombshell). Then, just as we were leaving, the waitress came up to us with two bottles of root beer, telling us it's on the house. Made our day! Recommended. Food 9/10 (because of the missing salt), Service 10/10",
