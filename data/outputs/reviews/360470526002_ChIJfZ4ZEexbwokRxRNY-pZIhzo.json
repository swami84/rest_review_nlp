We were super excited about this place that we traveled a hour just to go here. The carriages were an eye catcher and we managed to get a carriage seat. The food took a very long time to come. Once the food came, it looked delicious and we were exited to dig in. Instead,  we were extremely disappointed. This has been one of the worst restaurant experience. Every single  lamb dish that we ordered had an extremely strong smell which made it unbearable to eat, the pasta has so much salt that it ruined the taste buds. Worst of all 2/4 pastas has hair inside them. We made a complaint against this and it was taken out of the bill. In addition to this they charged us extra for something we never ordered. Overall this place was a dissapointment and I hope the manager takes this feedback into consideration.",

I took my grandchildren to eat at the grounds which they ordered burgers, I wanted an omelet which is served by milk and honey.long story short I wasn't allowed to eat in the carriages where my grandchildren were eating because I wanted an omelet, I was willing to order more food from the grounds just so I could sit with my grandchildren but the manager told me that I couldn't.  So I had to call the children's mother to come and sit with them while I sat across from them.This was the first and last time I will let my family eat at the  Grounds.",

        "caption": "The setup of this restaurant is very nicely done and is Halal. They have a cute little heated Cinderella carriage outside the restaurant that\u2019s def an eye catcher. However, I have to say I was extremely disappointed in everything they had to offer. The owner named either Matt or Max seemed very annoyed and had no clue on what was going on and apparently it\u2019s the same owner as Milk & Honey. First off, we called and asked for reservations but the waitress named Stephanie said that there are no reservations due to covid. We get to the restaurant, requesting to be seated in the nice Cinderella carriage and she tells us that we need reservations. Then, we proceeded to be seated in a shed where \u201cthere was heat\u201d. The room was ice cold and definitely could\u2019ve used more heating because their \u201cstrongest\u201d heater wasn\u2019t bussin\u2019. As the day went on, they brought out one dish of lamb chops that was ice cold @6:45pm. We didn\u2019t get the other four dishes til @7:27pm. At this point we request to be seated inside due to the room freezing off which they did accommodate but were very upset doing it. It\u2019s okay the servers had little to zero experience as Stephanie expressed she works on the cafe side so I started to expect the most inadequate customer service received. Taylor was the only one that was super friendly and efficient. Now, that we were seated inside and waiting on the rest of the food, there are no plates given or proper utensils. The rib-eye steak was a bit burnt that it tasted like charcoal. The spicy chicken jalape\u00f1o pizza wasn\u2019t spicy and was burnt. The Gnocchi with pesto and Mac and Cheese were good but mediocre. The food was awfully cold for the most part. I will cut them some slack because they do look like they just opened. Proper staffing is ideal especially if you\u2019re advertising halal Italian food. I do not recommend it with the current customer service they have. I will be back in 6 months to do another review.",

The place was not very busy and we got a table right away. The waiter forgot to order our drinks with the bar, it took them 30 minutes to bring our coffee. Had to ask four different people to bring me some lemon. Some of them I asked twice. After a while our eggs arrived, but they were cold. And I don't mean lukewarm, I mean cold. It probably would have tasted good if it was warm. My eggs were served on a wooden board, which is not ideal for sunny side up :)",

We ordered the italian nachos and a margarita pizza as appetizers. Then we ordered potato gnocchi and duck as our entrees. Everything was freshly prepared. The pasta is even made in house in their open kitchen. So you can see everything that\u2019s happening behind the scenes. This is definitely a restaurant that the neighborhood should support.",
