The Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and corn bread were decent but nothing special. I\u2019m usually able to finish food I don\u2019t like but I only ate 2 of the ribs before my stomach begged me to stop. The meal normally is 15 but I paid 10 dollars and even then it\u2019s way too overpriced. I would\u2019ve rather spent my money at chipotle and I don\u2019t even like chipotle. To make it worse, for that price it doesn\u2019t come with a drink either to wash the taste away. I\u2019ve never been offended by food before I had to right a review for the first time ever because I felt I had to warn people. Never coming here again.",

Dining here was like coming home to eat your favorite comfort foods with family.  Everything was delicious. I particularly loved the sweet potato casserole and the roast chicken. Their Meatloaf was great too, as was their ribs. A comforting favorite for me, though, was chicken pot pie and cornbread. Sadly, this Boston Market closed a few months ago. I dined once at the one in Gaithersburg, Maryland but it is too far away from me and it didn't feel as homey as the one on Randolph Road.",

When you ask for fresh ones they make up some extraordinary timeframe you will have to wait.  The last time I got prime rib it was grey and tasted so bland and the time before that I got brisket and received a bunch of scraps of meat that looked like they have been shredded and it had a lot of fat in it.  Yesterday I went there and the sides looked so bad we just walked out and went somewhere else.  I am not sure why the quality has gone so far down at this location but I will not be going there anymore.  It is unfortunate because I used to visit on a weekly basis but now I will find a new regular spot.  Update 5/22/19. I am a glutton for punishment.  I visited again and purchased 2 prime rib dinners.  Both were 50% fat and the little meat on it was bland and tasteless.  I would steer clear of this place.",

Employees were eating in the dining room with customers, when one of the workers, while still eating and chewing, walks back in behind the food counter, behind the side dishes, and clocks in while STILL chewing and holding whatever she was eating while clocking back in on the register, in front of customers, then went RIGHT back to food prep without washing her hands! I was so disgusted,  I threw the rest of my meal down, complained to the useless manager, then went home. Please note: while there, I noticed a guy that did absolutely NOTHING while there, that's actually why I noticed him (named Reggie) because all he did was lean on the pole next to the registers. I called the store to get GMs phone #, he answered, i asked for #, and his reply was \"who is this and why do you need it?!\" I'm a customer and it's none of your business! It was then he hung up on me! I called back and he hung up again! I called the 3rd time and the manager answered and finally gave me the #. The GM I spoke to was a great guy, extremely apologetic,  told me that's not the way he runs his stores, and I could tell he cared (at least I thought) I then called HIS boss, who didn't really seem to care and just took down the experience. Well, here I am weeks later, and neither manager has called me back, no one has tried to right this wrong, and my point of them not even caring for their customers is proven.  Main point is, if they don't endorse hand washing after eating, you think they really uphold that rule after employees wipe their butts? I think not. Absolutely disgusting, and even more disappointing that there has been no follow up.",

I  provided the employee with my online order number, she printed out the receipt, handed me a cup to go get my drink and then handed me a piece of cake in a container that looked like it had been there a week. Again another wait until my order was ready. Now it is 30 minutes past the time it should have been ready at curbside. I checked my order and it was wrong. Wrong vegetable, no gravy.

While sitting there, I forgot to mention that I wanted to have gravy put on both the turkey and potatoes so I went up there to mention this.  As I was saying my request to the worker behind the cash register, I noticed the manager taking someones nearly finished plate and pushing their uneaten sides back into the bins.  I was in absolute shock and since they mentioned it would take 20 minutes to get more turkey out, I asked if I could get my money back.  They were very willing to do so and I left. I will NEVER eat at another Boston Market and this is definitely something I wish I posted about earlier.  I'm still in shock at what I saw.",

There is a chubby Latina lady who is absolutely wonderful there, always seems to be finding something to attend to, & a younger american gent who we always overhear doing drive through who always gets a few folk to chuckle. The dining area is always getting messed up by kids & some lazy adults, but they do a wonderful job of trying to keep up. We forgot our receipt & missed something on our order, but the older lady on register remembered us & swapped our side order for the one we wanted without throwing out the whole tray, just scooped out the casserole into the trash with a plastic fork, & in went the mashed taters with extra gravy. Their tea machine was dirty once in the 20+ trips we've been there, & one of the young american ladies behind the counter IMMEDIATELY unplugged it & brought it to the back. Very efficient, very professional, but also very friendly. It's difficult to find fast food with a down-home attitude, but I'll travel 14 miles to come here, to this location, every single time.",
