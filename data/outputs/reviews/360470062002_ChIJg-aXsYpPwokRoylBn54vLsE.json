Lots of dishes were actually similar to Greek but made in a different way, I assume to justify the high price. For example, the rizogalo (rice pudding) on the menu was the least Greek thing and was only rizogalo in name and was way over priced. I enjoyed the meal but I really wouldn't go back as I've eaten at better Greek places that were more authentic and a lot cheaper.",

Some of my favorite dishes are the lamb chops, the lamb ravioli and the lamb shank (which falls off the bone and melts in your mouth). Their fish is out of this world and the chef adds his own personal flare to every dish.

There are no words to describe how yummy this was. I can't wait to return to try it again.  Next we moved on to the branzino deboned of course. I never want to work that hard to eat my food. If I had any complaints it would be that the fish didn't have enough meat. It must have been on a diet before it was caught. But despite the lightness or was still well prepared and tasty. I'm willing to call this one and off night for branzino. I added a side of Swiss chard. I like veggies so you almost can't mess then up for me.  The best part was the rice pudding dessert. It was just the right balance of sweetness.  The surroundings were very nice. I like the brick walls painted white giving you the feel of the white buildings you'd see in Greece.  I'm definitely adding this place to my list of preferred eating places and will return. Hope to see you there!",

I'm not, but the food was simply bad. It was all under seasoned and \"head scratchingly\" expensive. The photos looked amazing on the iPad menus so our party of 5 had a difficult time deciding on dishes but when the entrees were placed in front of us, we had to ask the waiter if there was some mistake? For example, one of the things we ordered was a beautifully depicted whole fish (from the iPad menu). What was served however was only part of the midsection of a fish just below the head and substantially above the tail. The response from the waiter was, \"That's all we have\", and then he walked off. We all tried a piece.... verdict? A cat would have trouble eating that. We also tried the Greek inspired paella... once again, looked amazing in the photo, but underwhelming and under seasoned. And again, the ravioli?... c'mon guys. What's going on? Are you being sabotaged by the staff? Do they want you to close down? Seriously, don't waste your money. You will regret it if you have an experience like we had. Instead, we wished we were at Mezze over on 13th Ave. Now that's amazing authentic Greek food done the right way. No misleading photos or subpar food served there. Its unpretentious comfort food and half the price to boot. Sorry Elia... we were excited to try what you could do with the Greek cuisine - especially when we saw that you \"apparently\" earned a \"Michelin Star\", which is a hallmark of fine dining quality and restaurants around the world. Holy cow, was someone paid off? Incredibly disappointing. Seriously, if it continues like that, you will need Gordon Ramsay there to scream at the chefs and staff if you want to save your business. Good luck.",

Food was excellent - Greek salad, flaming cheese, spreads, bread and even their olive oil! Lamb shank was enormous, enough to take some home for one lucky dog! Whole fish was was prepared simply and totally hit the spot. Elia continues to be a delightful destination. Highly recommended",
