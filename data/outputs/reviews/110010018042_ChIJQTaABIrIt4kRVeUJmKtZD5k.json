I called back at 9:51pm before hanging up after being on hold for 24 minutes and 22 seconds. This is UNEXCEPTABLE!!!!!!  If I could give 0 stars that is what I would have given for this review. This is not the first time that I've experienced bad customer service at this location, but it has never been this bad. This franchise definitely need to reconsider the individuals they hire or retain the incompetent staff that is currently there. I will definitely call back tomorrow for my refund, but I will also call the headquarters. I will NEVER spend another $$$ here again.",

The pizza didn't taste bad but the crust was overly charred.  Delivery time was excellent.  The pizza was delivered in 18 minutes from enter to delivery.",
