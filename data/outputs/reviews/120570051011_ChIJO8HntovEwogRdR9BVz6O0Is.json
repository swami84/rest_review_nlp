I like it cause you know exactly what you'll get. The sandwiches always taste homemade, with very fresh ingredients. Prices are beyond fair for downtown. I was going to deduct a star because the protein choices for the salads are quite limited and not the healthiest, but the service is too friendly, so I just couldn't. I also asked myself, \"if they're not a 5-star place, why do you go so often?\"... So there ya go.",

Basically you walk in and either pick up a to go container or plate with a tray and start picking out what you want. They have romaine lettuce freshly cut and separated into light and dark greens. You can then get some pasta salad, potatoes salad or chopped tuna or chicken. If you arrive after 11:30 the sushi California rolls will be ready and you can grab some of those. There are a tons of veggies at the veggie portion and the are pretty consistent with daily stock. They also have sliced ham or turkey to add. You have a choice between six different salad dressings and you can finish with nuts & raisins. At the very end by the registered there is some tasty Korean noodles (must try, trust me) and daily soup. Everything is weighed so if you load a lot of heavy food you will pay more than if you keep it light. They also have a variety of refreshments you can grab. Keep in mind this is more of a grab and go place not a fine dining experience. It's great for all those people who only have a 30 min lunch and need something fast and fresh!",
