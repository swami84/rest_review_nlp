Ordered the Taste 222 Burger and Sourdough Grilled Cheese online for pick-up for lunch today.  Both sandwiches were ordered with side salads.  All of the food was fresh and delicious!  Ketchup and salad dressings were packaged in their own separate containers to keep food from getting soggy.  Paid online and pickup was a breeze... friendly staff member, clean and inviting table where packaged orders were presented safely, and items placed in appropriately sized containers.  ONLY issue I have is that you cannot add tip when you order and pay online, so left a cash tip when I picked up the order.  Will definitely be back for carry-out until indoor dining is allowed again.  Thanks Taste 222!",

Food and drink was another thing. My friend and I both ordered the burger during happy hour and they weren\u2019t good at all. They tasted plant based and not like real beef. Assembly of burger was sloppy as well and we didn\u2019t eat but a few bites and left the rest. Drinks were just ok too. They need to carry top shelf liquors. One thing that was really bad was after we were done eating and the waiter brought the bill, then immediately he kept coming back to cash out. He even came and looked in the folder to take and cash out. This is very perturbing when you are trying to relax after a hard day. We did tell him we might get another drink but after trying to rush us out, we just paid and left. We are only talking about a bill that was for a total of 2 drinks folks between the 2 of us!!! It was not busy no one was waiting and it was only 8pm on a week night no less, so why rush us? Worst experience! I almost felt like throwing the bill and my credit card at him so he would leave us alone! Need to re-train the wait staff to be courteous and learn timing. People will pay their bill when they are ready so don\u2019t rush us!!! We aren\u2019t leaving town on a 2 drink bill and bar food! Really!!!",

I don't really like to send food back and didn't have the time to wait on a second preparation. Instead, I informed my waiter that the meat temperature was not what I ordered.  He informed the manager and had him come over. I spoke with him and he noted my comment and said it would be taken care of. When the bill arrived, he took $3 off of a $115 bill. He noted he gave us a 15% discount on the lamb.  In general, I felt that response to be quite insulting. I don't have a large following on this social media, but I will give all of my friends and colleagues my honest review of this place. Food is 3/5. Wait staff is attentive and good. Management I experienced left a lot more to be desired.",

This is a tapas(small  plates) type of place! They offer dessert but they didnt have the Carmel cake that night they ran out! That's the reason for 4 stars!

It's also a nice place to stop in after work and have a drink with colleagues or an intimate dinner with your loved one.  Taste 222 consists of a Large room with a high ceiling, there are 4 tables with seating for four people. There are 8 single seats in front of the kitchen, as well as seating at the long bar.  For people looking  for just a drink or an appetizer there is also couch seating in the corner.  We started off with a charcuterie which is smoked salmon, prosciutto, finocchiona, and a chef's selection of cheeses . It was a great start to a wonderful dinner. We tried the seared lamb chops, which were very tasteful, and I wanted more.   The Creole shrimp is more of a meal with seared Cajun shrimp, jalapeno goat cheese cornbread and a delicious Opelousas sauce.  By far the best dish I had was the dessert, the three layers chocolate caramel cake from Brown Sugar Bakery was huge, delicious,  and enough for 4 people to share.  Although the decor is upscale the waitress was very casually dressed, which I did not understand, maybe because it was a weeknight  With a menu that characterizes their dinners as small plates, just be aware that they are just that, small plates. Portions are small but be adventurous and order several to share.",
