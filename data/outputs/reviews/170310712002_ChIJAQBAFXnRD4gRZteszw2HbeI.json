You guys, i can\u2019t say enough- from the presentation to the taste - myself, my husband and children love love love her food (and her). My 6 year old asked me if i could call Chef Taryn and ask her to \u201cmake 500 lemon desserts\u201d so she would always have one to eat \ud83d\ude00. Kismet is awesome, the staff is fantastic, the storefront has really great items (i left with 3 candles) and I cant wait to host a party at Kismet. It\u2019s beautiful.",

The chocolate cake with peppermint and chantilly cream is next on my list.   When I pick up my order from Kismet, it is so beautifully wrapped and I feel like it is a gift to me.  I highly recommend Kismet Table-  be sure to order in advance, they do sell out!",

Her dishes are delicious twists on classic recipes made with the freshest ingredients. Every detail is impeccable and carefully considered, she puts her heart and soul into every bite. I\u2019m so grateful that she finally opened The Kismet Kitchen so that all of Chicago can finally get the chance to experience her incredible culinary talents.",

There was not a word uttered between my husband and I as we dove into this sumptuous meal. It was truly lovely. Order...right now...you will not be disappointed! It's a wonderful little indulgence that you will absolutely enjoy. Thank you, Taryn, we will be back.",

        "caption": "All I can say is W-O-W!! From start to finish, Chef Taryn and her team think through every little detail. First of all, listen to this menu for a sit down dinner for ten (all of which was suggested by Chef Taryn herself): toasted brioche with whipped chicken liver mousse & blackberry jam, caramelized onion tartlets, citrus poached shrimp with tarragon aioli on endive spear, burrata with heirloom tomato, fresh corn & pancetta, roasted salmon & pistachio pesto, and apple crisp with salted caramel and vanilla bean gelato!!  The food was melt-in-your-mouth-to-die-for, and the service was impeccable. What sets The Kismet Table apart, aside from food that you'll be thinking about for a long time to come, is that they really produce every aspect of your event- from the moment your guests walk in, to the moment they leave. They are available to help with decor, floral arrangements, wine pairings, and any/all rentals needed. Chef Taryn even brought the most divine lavender culinary salts as a gift for all guests at the end - a surprise that we didn't even request. The level of thoughtfulness is unparalleled. If you're looking to wow your guests with the best food, service and team in Chicago - hire The Kismet Table. You won't regret it.",

One couple said they are lucky to have traveled the world and dined at the best restaurants, and this dinner was truly exceptional.   I couldn\u2019t agree more.  Start to finish, it was a wonderful experience, and I hope we get to do many more such dinners - and other occasions (Mark your calendar for February 14, 2020!)",
