We picked up a menu to see what they had, then we were approached by a male server who asked if we needed a table. We told him yes, so he took the menus from us and sat us. Nice area, very pretty, there\u2019s an option to sit outside as well. We were given water and a few minutes to figure out what we wanted. After a little bit, he came back and took our order. About 10-15 mins later our food was brought out by different server. We ate, it was pretty good. Then we sat for about 10-15 minutes after finishing out food until we could track the new server down for our check. Overall not a good experience, service was bad. We were never greeted, or simply told hello. The first server was rude and disappeared and we never saw him again. The second server was again rude, not personable at all. She never asked us how our meal was or anything. Food was good but wouldn\u2019t go back. For such a nice hotel, I would expect better service.",

First, the restaurant had no booster seats, only a high chair--which was not really what my 3-year-old needed.  It worked out OK, but you rarely see a restaurant nowadays that doesn't offer both high chairs and booster seats.  Another black mark in the kid-friendly department was the mini-hamburgers on the children's menu:  the buns were miniature, but the patties were simply one full-sized patty cut into halves, which didn't really fit the buns.  Our server forgot to take drink orders for my son and me (the other adults were drinking wine already by that point); the hostess came by and got milk for my son, but when I asked about a drink for me, she told me the server would take my drink order, and when I noted he hadn't actually done so, and asked her to ask him about it, she ignored me.  For the impression I got, she might as well have said, \"It's not my job.\"  The server did finally take my order 15 minutes or so later, but after that, he didn't offer to refill either my son's milk or my soft drink until the meal was nearly over.  And all of this while the restaurant was nearly deserted--so it's not like the staff was overwhelmed.  As we were about to leave, I needed to change my son's diaper, and discovered no changing station in the first (small, unisex) restroom I found.  I asked the hotel concierge where I could change him, and he gave me directions to the men's room...and as I was trying to process those, he added \"You're welcome,\" seemingly indicating that I should have said \"Thank you\" already.  In any case, thanks would have been undeserved, because the restroom lacked anywhere to change a diaper.  Indeed, my wife then discovered that the women's room lacked a changing stand as well, though at least there was a couch she could use.",

        "caption": "For upscale dining they need training. The duck confit was a thigh and leg finished in oven? This is just wrong, should have been breast and not re heated and might as well been chicken it was so mild. The filet was completely under seasoned. These are basics and unforgivable.  Our waitress didn't say a word that we could hear and then stood ten feet away the whole meal and stared at us. Prices were fine if the food was up to par. I imagine from other reviews that breakfast was the way to go but wouldn't risk another bad experience.",
