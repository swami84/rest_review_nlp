Getting a reservation was challenging, which was the first good sign. Luckily walk in seeting at the sushi bar is available. Immediately on entering the restaurant you'll notice that place is trendy and upscale. The decor is well picked and arranged. The staff here are also polite and the service is prompt. They have a decent selection of beverages with cocktails, beer and wine available. Everything we saw being prepared was colorful and beautifully arranged. We ordered the Philadelphia Roll, garlic edamame, croquettes, and leahi roll. Everything was excellent. I'm not a vegan, and not a fan of vegan cream cheese but in the rolls it works well. The only change I would have made would be to add Jalape\u00f1os to the Philadelphia roll. Everything was excellent, fun, and delicious. I highly recommend this to everyone regardless of diety choices.",

So if you are in the same boat, I absolutely still recommend this restaurant.  The bean curd nigiri was smoky, umami packed...the tomato nigiri was infused to be just the right amount of fishy in all the good ways.  The rolls were innovative, but I actually preferred the simpler, cleaner nigiri options.  The tenpura and agedashi tofu was winners as well.  Finished the dinner satisfied and full.

I had such a lovely time watching them craft each dish, & after I tasted each one, I did a happy dance as my heart bursted with joy! The staff is so friendly, along with the owner, who was crafting the sushi himself, alongside another angel who also creates magical desserts daily! A+++! What a beautiful blessing!

They even have a roll called the Barber's that is a fun game to play with friends. One out of 6 rolls has a hidden ghost pepper (?) in it. Like sushi roulette, whoever unknowingly eats it will burn their mouths off and get to ake the shot in the middle. Ambiance is nice and dimly lit. The food is incredibly creative -- you won't even miss the fish when you come here. And the dessert they  offer is always changing. Service is on point and very professional.

The dishes were so good that we ate most of it before thinking to take pictures!  The wedge roll was probably the table favorite.   There is on street parking but there's also a parking lot just past the front door on the left side of the road.   We circled the block a few times before confirming that we could use the parking lot. If you're looking for a great vegan restaurant in Waikiki don't miss Tane!  Call ahead for reservations or you'll have to wait for a seat at the bar.",

Should we expect the same level of service, food quality and flavour from ethical establishments? The time limit is the deal breaker here and results in less stars. Otherwise the meal would have been 5 stars. It\u2019s an awful experience to be rushed or to feel there is a time limit on your dining experience and for me that ruined the meal. We sat at the bar, with uncomfortable seating and very little space.  We had the Tofuna rolls, Sandy speciality roll, Mushrooms appetizer and Spicy Ramen. The Sandy was the best.  Come enjoy the Vegan sushi but for the owners please change this practice.",

We dressed up because when they first open they had a dress code . We got there to realized we were overdressed . There is absolutely no dress code .  While we had an okay waiter , we weren't the happiest because lets face it who wants to celebrate an intimate moment such as their anniversary sitting at the end of a sushi bar (where u cant even see the chef) watching waiters ring up orders all night....maybe some people but not us. We made a reservation and told them it was a special occasion, our 2 year anniversary, on the reservation, arrived 15 minutes early as well. We expressed to the hostess we didnt want to sit at the bar she explained to us that we had to reserve a table . I explained we did have a reservation  but she broke it down to me that we had to call to reserve a table . NO WHERE IS THAT LISTED ON THEIR WEBSITE !! ALL it says is reserve a table THATS IT. Ontop of that there were 4 empty tables when she decided to sit us at the bar .  Needless to say we werent big fans of our experience . AT ALL . MY wife and I are huge foodies we love to go out to eat and try alot on the menu. Normally, we stay at a restaurant at least hour ordering and trying things including desserts, we never just order 1 thing on the menu. We try it all normally spending over $100+. We only ordered 1 thing each and something to share(WHICH WE NEVER DO) and left . She does reviews of restaurants on ig and this experience wasnt worth giving any praise about due to lack of communication . My wife does not want to come back.  however 1 thing i did like about the restaurant was the lady sitting next to us . and she was a customer . The customer told us happy anniversary but none of the workers did . and we put it on our reservation !!!!  the food was okay . we left hungry . we still tipped our waiter because its not his fault.  i do not recommend this restaurant .",

Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable, my server gave me incredible recommendations. I am devastated to go home tomorrow and not have access to this place!  The sushi is pure art; actually replicating fresh fish sushi rather than the heavy tempura and spicy mayo alternatives I'm used to (which are also delicious but much easier to find and less refined).

We unfortunately don\u2019t have any vegan sushi places in Sydney and so I was very excited to try Tane Vegan Izakaya on my small kauai trip while travelling through Hawaii. It was my top dining experience out of every place that I went to during my holiday. We got a seat at the bar, which I was initially concerned about as you do loose some intimacy but being right in front of the chefs was so much fun! They were so welcoming, friendly and had such a great energy, which kept us smiling throughout the night. We loved seeing them make the food and they offered us great suggestions! We ordered the Pacifica, sunset, baker, point Reyes as our rolls and the shizen shiitake and croquettes as our entrees. I can\u2019t pick a favourite!",
