Very welcoming they know my order by heart!  Just today I forgot my chopsticks that are connected for easy eating and instead of getting me a fork they made me one with a rubber band and paper filling in between because they know that\u2019s what I use.  I love this place and the people who work here.  Good sushi and ramen! Also the sesame chicken is another great dish!",

When you walk in, the dark interiors and dim lighting make the place very inviting and open. I really enjoyed the food - we ordered wild mushroom soup which was delicious, vegetarian potstickers which were good too, and the four sushi we ordered were wonderful too. We ordered - zen sushi (not pictured), Rock n' roll, Spice Girl, Sexy Mexican. I honestly would give the this place a 4/5 but the service was not a pleasant experience. Our server was for some reason not welcoming and not attentive. We had ordered another sushi roll and waited for close to 20 mins for the order to come which never did despite her saying that it's ready. We had sent the Miso soup back because it was beyond salty and she was visibly not pleased. She was very pleasant with another set of table and didn't extend the same courtesy to us. It's a shame that the service was subpar because Nui B  has potential and I would love to visit again but will not be returning anytime soon.",

The atmosphere is lovely, and you can even watch the chefs cook food. 2 of my favorite things to order would be the Crunchy Roll and Sexy Mexican sushi platters. Give them a try if you decide to dine, but check the ingredients in case you have certain food limits.",

We ordered our drinks, appetizers, and meals. We got the soup along with our dinners, buutttttt... no appetizers! We finished our meals before she came over cleared the plates not once checking on how the meal was and STILL forgetting our apps. I mention it to her and she tried to say we e didn't order apps when I said yes ma'am we did and repeated our order, I think it clicked! She then says oh, yes coming right up! We get them (at this point was over the apps)  it my daughter had been dying for a sushi date. When we get the apps there could and the 11 year old wouldn't even eat them.

There are 2 other sushi places in the neighborhood preferable over this one, so unfortunately Niu takes the bronze. The rock shrimp sounded so good.. and was SO bad. It looked neon, almost like it was coated in flaming hot cheetos. It actually turned us off on ordering any other shrimp on the menu. However.. the rose was good and it sparkled so that made me happy.",

        "caption": "Tonight.  The patron  seated close  to me was over served by the staff and started commenting on the ethnicity of the staff and other patrons using very racist and misogynistic terms.  I alerted the manager (possibly owner and or partner) of this patron's behavior and was told he was regular.  I was very upset and alarmed in this climate with his behavior.   The manager's response was extremely dismissive and indifferent.  If this is the type of atmosphere you enjoy this is your place. The location is interesting but  it might be more appropriate located in Trump Tower.",
