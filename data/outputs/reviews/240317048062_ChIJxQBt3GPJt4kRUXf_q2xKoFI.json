Third, most of the very expensive main dishes had only 4-5 pieces of meat or fish and were mostly overcooked. It was as if we were given leftovers?

I'm not sure where to even begin -- probably  the moment when our team stepped off our charter bus to get the most amazIng whiff of grilled Lebanese delicacies that fill the sidewalk.  Truth is the aroma only got better once we went inside and found tabouleh, falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush waiting for us.  Our team of 25 high school upperclassmen devoured the appetizers only to be floored by the bountiful spread of Kafka, and grilled chicken set upon a bed of aromatic rice with grilled onions and tomatoes.  Spectacular!  As if that was not enough, the lightest limoncello custard was graciously served to round out our \"meal of the Gods!\"  Mixed with the stunning ambience all around you, this restaurant is a MUST TRY if you are ever in Bethesda! Zaid is the most gracious manager and purveyor of incredible food that we have ever had on our team's travels....It has been an honor getting to know him for 5+ years.  His staff is equally accommodating and whether it's a casual Thursday evening, like tonight, or a memorable family occasion that you are celebrating, you've got to try Bacchus of Lebanon!  Like us from Pittsburgh, you will be a fan for life....",

I liked the zataar and olive oil dip for the pita bread, as well as the mint and cucumber yogurt sauce. The romain lettuce for the tabouleh was very fresh. No raw kibbee here, and the grape leaves and cabbage rolls had \"meat\" in them. I thought $42 for a mediocre bottle of Reisling was pricey. I would return next time I am in the area.",

Maybe the best Lebanese restaurant in the area. Fish kabob was really good. I love tiger salad. Not to many items on the menu (which I like) , but good quality. Lunch special is great. One waiter takes care of customers alone, but surprisingly he is fast and does everything great. Thumbs up.  Edit: I visited today again, and shawarma was really really good. I give 4.5 stars.",

Try ordering a few different appetizers so you can get a wider variety of food to sample from. We have had the kibbeh (comes with tahini) tabuleh, hummus,  foul (fava beans), and stuffed leaves. It is enough food for 2 people with a normal appetite. The tabuleh, although good, is not made to be the best. Traditionally, it should have all the herbs cut very very small and without stems. This restaurant could use more care in preparing the tabuleh. Also, the shawarmas are served open faced -- not traditional.  Aside from these little things, the cuisine is truly delicious and so delicate. Highly recommend eating here.  Please check their schedule since they close at 2pm and then reopen at 5 or 5.30pm for dinner.",

Shortly after, the lone waiter came to us quickly took our orders and started taking care of another large group. He was amazing! He took care of another 6-7 tables while he was attentive to our group and the large group. Food came out fast and friendly and right on time and we didn't want for anything. Oh and btw, the food was delicious!!  The whole operation was one guy waiting the tables and one or two guys in the kitchen!! It was amazing!!!

I realized very quickly, we were in front of the restaurant saying goodbye to our friends. My husband immediately knocked on the door, it was closed. Not wanting to disturb anyone he called the next morning. No scarf in sight, hard to believe ... but hey ... we were advised to call back a week later to see if she had not left with the dirty laundry at the laundry. We recall and there we are told that if it was in the laundry it was automatically destroyed ... so this one had never been made to me before. We were also told, when we had not expressed this thought at all, being rather naively confident in the honesty of people on principle, that there was no thief in the staff .... If you go to this fairly expensive restaurant for good but not exceptional food and you care about your things, be very careful not to forget them. We, great lovers of Middle Eastern cuisine, will not be back.  (Original) Je suis venue diner avec mon mari et des amis la semaine derni\u00e8re chez Bacchus Bethesda. En partant, nous etions les derniers clients, j'ai oublie mon \u00e9tole sur ma chaise. Je m'en  suis tres vite aper\u00e7u, nous etions en face du restaurant entrain de dire au revoir \u00e0 nos amis. Mon mari est all\u00e9 frapper tout de suite \u00e0 la porte, c'etait ferm\u00e9. Ne voulant deranger personne il a appele le lendemain matin. Pas d'echarpe en vue, difficile \u00e0 croire...mais bon...on nous a conseille de rappeler une semaine plus tard pour voir si elle n'etait pas partie avec le linge sale au pressing. Nous rappelons et l\u00e0 on nous dit que si elle etait au pressing elle a ete automatiquement detruite....alors celle-la on ne me l'avait encore jamais faite. On nous a dit aussi, alors que nous n'avions pas du tout emis cette pensee, etant plutot naivement confiant dans l'honnetet\u00e9 des gens par principe, qu'il n'y avait pas de voleur dans le personnel.... Si vous allez dans ce restaurant assez cher pour une cuisine bonne mais pas exceptionnelle et que vous tenez \u00e0 vos affaires, faites tres attention de ne pas les y oublier. Nous , grands amateurs de cuisine moyen orientale, nous reviendrons pas.",

They sat us near the kitchen/bathroom away from everyone and that same waitress looked appalled that I used their restroom. Our waiter seemed nice enough but you could tell they sent the one waiter who would tolerate us. When it was time to leave the hostess said something and my husband said to her we know you do not want us here. It was raining outside so my husband wanted me to stand near the door while he pulled the car up. The hostess did not like that and almost told me I could not stand there or to leave but she caught herself and just stood there uncomfortable. The funny thing is there is lots of Lebanese in my country, which is an African country so I thought they would be cool. I give one star because the food was good.",

They are happy to share stories and talk about from where the food or wine comes. We have brought several friends and all of them have raved about the experience.

Service is a bit of a sore point here with this being a very family run restaurant, roles often get overlapped and that ends up with lower service levels than a bigger chain.  But the food makes up for the poor service. They have an extensive menu that takes some time going thru and the decision making is that much harder given the excellent choices in the menu!  The Hummus and Labneh were good appetizer choices that everyone liked.  We ordered the following for the main course and here is my review of the dishes that I tasted/ had as my main course: Combination (Extraordinaire Bacchus) - The lamb in the Shish Kebab was tender, and succulent and seasoned well  Warak Inab Mehchi - the minced meat was flavorful and cooked well in the grape leaf that had a nice tang to it.  The portions are huge, especially if you order appetizers and we had enough left for a decent meal portion the next day!  They do have a decent selection of wines to go with the food :)",
