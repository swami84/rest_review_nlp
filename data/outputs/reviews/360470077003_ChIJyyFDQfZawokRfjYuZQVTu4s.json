The food was good, the coffee was bitter in my opinion, and my friend thought the Mango Mimosa was too sugary. The waiter/waitress was ok. The service was ok, didn't receive certain things when asked initially so we had to ask again. In our opinion it was just ok, not a place we would go back again.",

She generally were upset about something and so every interaction expect for when she asked \u201cis everything okay\u201d went sour. E.g. when my brother tried to help her with glasses ( he worked as a waiter and always compassionate towards people in customer care) she said \u201cno,no,no\u201d as if he was insulting her. Another example, when we were giving our order she interrupted us and said \u201cwait a minute, I\u2019m writing it down\u201d. Not to be picky but I\u2019m was taken aback by that. Especially given we all were super friendly, said \u201cthank you so much\u201d for every little thing she did. As for the head waiter/manager when I asked to remove cinnamon from the cappuccino he said \u201cfor the future ask for no cinnamon because cappuccinos always come with cinnamon\u201d which is absolutely not the case. I literally had cappuccino yesterday in Bushwick and it didn\u2019t have cinnamon on top. Plus, for first time visitors we had no idea. Needless to say we left unhappy.

        "caption": "So, I do like this place. It's small, only accepts cash and takes no reservations! You have been warned. Moving along, the interior is beautifully decorated-it have birds and nests and white Christmas lights and candles, etc! Nothing is over the top or in your way. It's a regular restaurant that just feels cozy and appealing. I'm not sure what time breakfast/brunch ends but the restaurant closes the kitchen and dining area from 4-5 and reopens at 5pm for dinner.  Dinner was my first experience. I ordered the NY strip. It came with roasted potatoes instead of mashed potatoes and well done instead of medium. My party ordered Pork Chops, and 2-3 course meals. The three course meal is for $40 and offers appetizer, entrees, dessert and a glass of wine. Nice offer and great choices. One person got the Chicken and the other then Sirloin. Their dessert choices were apple crumble/apple strudel and creme brulee. I got the lemon tart and another person the carrot cake. To drink we had all three Belgium Beers, white wine and red wine selection. The beers were awesome and so was the red wine(I think it was a Cab). The food was very tasty and so were the desserts. A guest and owner knew each other so he offered us a creme brulee to go and I graciously accepted.  From start to finish everything was lovely and our service wasn't lacking or over the top (and we were 2/3 tables until the end of our entrees). My desserts were the lemon squares and creme brulee which were mouth watering to say the least. I tasted the carrot cake which was delicious as well. Everything was so great I had to go back for round two-this time, breakfast!  There are no unlimited drinks here so I cannot call it Brunch as NYers know it. My guest ordered the steak and eggs which came out well done with a [teriyaki] glaze, scrambled eggs, dry white toast and potatoes. I ordered the steak and cheese enchiladas with sour cream. When my plate was presented it looked like a hurricane threw up. Buried under a mountain of lettuce was a blanket of cheese and a peek-a-boo of overcooked steak. After I remove all that lettuce I cut into the enchiladas to find onions and peppers. I don't know about you but I like when I read then menu and get what the menu says-Absolutely No garnishes or suprises. If something is in that dish and not listed on the menu then it's up to the server to be good at their job and alert the patron.  So, after fighting with the ton of lettuce and finally cutting into my meal to be shocked I called over the server again and told him I did not want it. He went through the motion of asking what was wrong again and it got to the point where I had to show him what the menu said. His reply was a casual \"well that's what it comes with\" and I said \"that's alright, but if someone doesn't work here you should let them know\". And, to top it off the kitchen claimed the enchiladas were premade and could not take out the added stuff. At that point I lost my appetite but my guest who Loved this restaurant insisted I order something. I opted for what they had. The server comes back and tells me I have to wait another 30-40 min because my food would be at the end of the line. BAD customer service.  I told him to reuse the steak that was on my plate(which they probably would have done anyway) and scramble the eggs because that shouldn't take long. My plate returned 10min later with potatoes with onions and peppers. I know what you are thinking... I didn't send it back this time. As we sat next to the nasty busser dish tub I slowly threw the onions and peppers in it one by one. The potatoes were severely undercooked, steak still overdone, eggs absent, toast dry, no smile on my face or patience in my heart I ate what I could before we left to enjoy the rest of our day.  Will I return? Hell no. Do I recommend this place? If you're in the neighborhood, grab a desert and leave.",

I took my cousin there from out of town to impress and was disappointed. Not to mention in 2019 this rest doesn't except debit or any credit cards. Cash only which isn't indicated until your ready to pay your bill. Should be at least noted on the door as you enter. Most don't carry cash when out and about. Sadly this fabulous place will lose customers strictly due to poor service and non-acceptance of debit!",

The staff and owner are very accommodating.  It's really quite lovely & yet reasonable. If you are doing a special event I advise skipping the  house wines &  paying extra for one of their better choices.    On the event food menu we recommend the grilled shrimp.  Also ask for menu adjustments & see what they can do.  If on the other hand this is just dinner for two or four - well that  depends what you're looking for. If it's privacy in a beautiful space then it's a great choice as long as you get seated in the rear garden.  But for fine dining - it can't compete with the many choices we have in NYC for excellent cuisine.  Those places will be more expensive of course. On the dinner menu we recommend the grilled calamari & the hanger steak. Cash only for routine dining.",

Spectacular visually, private dining & events are also held here. Not to mention the food was just delicious. Three were 4 of us dining. 3 opted to order off of the pre-fix menu. One ordered calamari, stuffed chicken & a Apple pie for dessert. Two of us had the cod with perfect spinach & avacado salad, for dessert 1 cheesecake to go & another apple pie w/a cappuccino\ud83d\ude0b. Last but not least the fried chicken w/veggies & fries.

The decor is a bit confusing: on one side you have pink and white paper lanterns, another area has a 5 foot statue of the Virgin Mary, on a wall you see a statue of Budai and a Hindi statue not too far from it all while some low key house/ trance music quietly plays in the background. Nothing about this place is French.  The service is non existent. Get two coffees because you wont be asked if you want a second cup of anything. My girlfriend's Bellini came 30 minutes after she ordered it because that's how long it took for us to flag down the waiter that took the order, his response, \"yea, sorry. I'm just busy.\" The managers or owners are too busy trying to direct their untrained servers to bussing tables then actually doing anything themselves. They are a bit understaffed for the amount of volume coming in through the door. It's a shame because they do have a great opportunity to capitalize on Buttermilk Channel's long wait times.  Steak and Eggs - steak was overcooked, eggs over cooked, home fries undercooked.  Waited 40 minutes for our food to arrive (we were a two top that ordered a dish each).  Do yourself a favor and wait for your table at Buttermilk channel. By the time Le Petit Cafe gets your drink order right you'll be sat at the place you wanted to go to in the first place.",

So I searched on G.maps again and noticed this was just up the block. I have to say they had me at hello.  The views from the display cases in the front to the beautifully appointed rustic patio in the back of the house made the experience a lot more than just about the food.  Our server Jerry was Johnny-on-the-spot, or in his case Jerry-on-the-spot, and never skipped a beat on any of the tables he served.  The food was served hot, fresh and to order. My Amaretto French Toast was delicious, to say the least, and when I asked for maple syrup it was delivered warm and in a small single serve carafe.  There was a steady stream of patrons, from all walks of life, that gave the place a wonderfully diverse & energetic buzz. This is on the list for top places for breakfast & brunch, and I will return to try their lunch & dinner offerings. #LetsGuide #Reco100 #RecoveringKnowItAll",

The food was great, I had amaretto french toast and they blew me away. Really can't complain about the food. It does disappoints me that they are cash only. I tend to stay away from restaurants who can't accept credit cards. I came back twice since and each time was worse than the previous time. In fact yesterday we walked out, as the server took other tables (who sat down after us) orders and just ignored our table. We waited patiently for 20 minutes. And no they were really not busy. So if you ever do go here, just know the food is great but the service and management sucks.",

The waiter had an attitude and told me I needed to wait before he ordered my lemons and proceeded to take the orders of other individuals who walked into the restaurant after us. I will never return again. Never have I ever experienced such a rude waiter. When we walked out he didn't even question or apologize for the terrible service.

Not only were all the prices $2-3 dollars higher than the menu they provided us last month, but the food that was delivered was a soggy mess. I had a simple Burger and Fries, the fries were a soggy pile of under-cooked potato. The burger was bland at best and the bun was so soggy, I had to go across the street to the store to buy a roll to replace it with. These guys are on my S-list, won't be ordering again.",

The decor is just stunning, in particular in the \"outdoor\" seating in the back area. the prices are reasonable and the food is absolutely worth it. the atmosphere is great, and it was not even an issue that we dimmed the lighting a bit ourselves in the evening. The service is a bit slow, but if your are not in a rush and you don't mind this \"European\" style of taking and enjoying your time, it is just a perfect stop to go out for dinner or brunch.",
