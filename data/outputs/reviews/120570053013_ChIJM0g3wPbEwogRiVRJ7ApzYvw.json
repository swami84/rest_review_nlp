However, I recently visited in the daytime and it was quite lovely. They allow outdoor full service seating if you bring your puppy. Directly across the street is a small park to walk your dog too. So while I have enjoyed this venue at night, my daytime visit has been that much more enjoyable. The atmosphere is decent. Not mind blowing or overly nice, pretty simple in nature (ie the floors are concrete,the tables are not matching, and the ambiance is a little confusing). But all things considered, it's a solid \"4-star\" boba cafe.  I appreciate their vegan/vegetarian options and the array they serve of foods and teas. There is a little something here for everyone. The staff has always been helpful and nice.~ even if it doesn't become your #1 spot, it's worth a visit.",

(BBQ pork bahn mi, grilled chicken bahn mi, iced Vietnamese coffee, ice Thai Tea with boba, Taiwan Black Tea with boba, mango dragon fruit with jelly) 10 minutes pass and server walks up to us to tell us they don't have any more Thai Tea. We request for iced matcha tea latte.  10 more minutes pass (other customers arrive. Party of 5) and server brings us 2/4 drinks (Taiwan Black Tea and Iced Matcha tea latte). 1/5 stars for both of the drinks. The Taiwan Black Tea tasted watered down and the Iced Matcha tea latte tasted like fish sauce. I asked my girlfriend if she wanted a different drink but she insisted she didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for a drink.  5 minutes later our food came out with our 3rd drink. ( 25 minutes and 3/4 drinks have arrived.) Upon looking at our food, it was visually appealing. That was about the only thing appealing about the two bahn mi. The meat was precooked and cool to the touch. Grilled chicken looked/tasted as if it was precooked and frozen. And the grilled pork tasted like beef jerky. The only saving thing for the bahn mi was that the bread was toasted and tasted good.  15 minutes later (so 40 minutes all together) my iced Vietnamese coffee arrives after finishing our food. The coffee was okay. Not good. Not bad.  Servers were very monotone and unenthusiastic.  Will not be returning to this restaurant. You can say that we were \"bamboozled\".",

The pho was not good at all.  The wife had shrimp which was very overcooked and rubbery.  The beef in mine was also very dry and overcooked.  I cannot be sure because I was not in the kitchen but it seems as if they cook the meat before they let the pho cook it.  The broth was also made with waaaaay too much cilantro (or other green leafy herb).  Every bite would have a leaf.  I am only giving a second star because of the atmosphere and their friendly attitude to dogs.  There are many good Vietnamese options in downtown Tampa, I would reccomend going to one of them instead of this place.",

I have been coming here for 3 years and the first year I loved it and slowly the employees and their attention to detail have changed and it's clear they don't always properly follow the recipe.  My biggest complaint is with the drinks. Employees don't follow the same recipe making the boba smooties. Sometimes the drinks are perfect and other times they are too sweet. So I asked then to make it less sweet and then it wasn't sweet at all. The boba is often under boiled and hard in the middle, however the last time it was way too soft and dissolved in the drink and was barely chewy.  It has been a month since my last visit. I do plan to come back but haven't had a good experience my last 5 visits. I hope this business will become more consistent because I do love their concept.",

The chicken bahn mi and strawberry pineapple smoothie got highest marks \u2014 probably 4 stars. The strawberry smoothie and taro bubble tea were just okay. The BBQ pork was very good but the spring roll was larger than I'm used to, wasn't well wrapped, and the lettuce had a number of brown pieces. The beef and pork on the noodle salads were similarly very good, as was the fresh mango, but the proportions seemed off and the pickled ginger wasn't a great surprise. The peanut sauce also seemed a little off. Service was okay \u2014 not overly friendly or motivated but okay. Everything came out at different times, so our meal together was a little awkward. But it's a nice and interesting atmosphere (dog friendly!) and we'd probably try it again.",

This charming tea eatery in the Channelside locale is hard to beat. There were numerous tea flavors hot or iced. Several specialty drink choices added flare, as well . And the wonderfully fresh and edgy Asian fare was appealing to all. There were even yummy dessert options . Beautiful presentation and delicious  choices for everyone's tastes.  The atmosphere was charming and relaxing and just perfect for a get together or a luncheon party. The efficient service, helpfulness and etiquette of the manager and staff were beyond expectations. My guests and \"mommy to be\" (who became a mommy now) were thrilled with our day at Bamboozle and would highly recommend this charming cafe. Thank you so much again to all at Bamboozle Tea Lounge !",

It also had ingredients on it that I requested not be on it so I ended up not eating it. Better inventory management is nice as well because things seem to always be out when we are there. We enjoy coming here for lunch on the weekend but this makes us hesitant about coming back.  Outside of that we usually enjoy coming here.",
