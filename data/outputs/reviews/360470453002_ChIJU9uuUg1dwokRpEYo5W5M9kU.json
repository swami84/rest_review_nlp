The BEC is perfection. All of the meats are homemade/cured, and you can taste the difference. The omelette is light and fluffy, and the tomato jam? GENIUS. All on a homemade ciabatta bun. FOR $6!!!! There isn't another vegan cafe in the city that offers such a quality sandwich for an attainable price. For comparison, a certain vegan bakery in Williamsburg  sells their BEC for $16.  The croissants are flaky, light, buttery, everything you want from a croissant. Blissful.  The cinnamon roll comes decked out in glitter and dried edible flowers, which makes eating this treat a CELEBRATION! Wonderful depth of flavor, and not cloyingly sweet.  My friend got the toast of the week, and she LOVED it! Beautifully presented, amazing pickled onions, and all for $5?!  The cold brew is strong and refreshing, exactly what you'd find at a specialty coffee shop.  The staff is so welcoming and friendly, you can tell that everyone LOVES what they do. Not to mention the FIRE music playing inside!  The only downside was the small line on a Sunday morning, but that's what happens when you have an amazing business that follows covid protocols by only allowing 2 people in at a time. Seitan Rising is worth the  wait!",
