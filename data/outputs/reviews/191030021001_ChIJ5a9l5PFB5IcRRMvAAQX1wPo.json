So everybody grab your vodkas and dance the night away to the musical stylings of Pitbull, Jason Derulo, Ne-Yo and many other similar artists. It has an upstairs that I was abruptly denied access to because apparently there was a private party or something. I asked to go upstairs just to look at it for a second and was still denied. You are a great bouncer. You deserve your job. The security here is very strict, tight and enforced or in other words they are not playin'. If you've read this whole review obviously this is a joke but everything is real. It's not a bad place though.",

They may say that they socially distance and enforce masks while customers aren\u2019t eating or drinking, but we\u2019ve seen the videos showing otherwise.

We would of left then but we were meeting friends there. Got served a Miller lite bottle with puke on it. For real....it was puke. Took it back and they apologized and they admitted someone puked all over a bunch of beer. How the bartender didn't notice that before serving says something about their staff. Their bathrooms were the worst I'd ever seen. Who ever had to clean them later ( if they even did) would of had to wear a rubber body suit. They should of just called hazmat to do the job. It was nasty from noon till midnight (unfortunately we had to go back later to see friends before we left town). They did mop their main floor at one time during the early evening time but over looked the bathrooms. I do blame the nasty people who have no respect for public property but that's what happens at bars with young college students, but as bar owners you know this.....I shouldn't have to leave your establishment to pee elsewhere. And people paid $5 to go here?? Save your money and go elsewhere!",

I said before that the fries were over seasoned, I still believe this, on some days, others they are pretty good. I also said that it is stupid that they charge $1 for a box. I still feel that way. However that is most-likely the owner's choice and shouldn't reflect upon the staff. Which brings me to my last point, the staff I said before was mostly good and friendly. I believe I may have been referring to newer wait staff as the ones who brought down my opinion, however that is unfair, as any newer person wouldn't be as good as the experienced ones. The wait staff is very good, especially those that are able to take multiple orders with only their memory and get it all right. And they all are very friendly.  So I would like to apologize to the staff, as because I was having a bad day, I ended up taking it out in a review. And I thank the gentleman host at summit for bringing it to my attention as an unfair review is unjust.",
