And the chashu is better than most places I've been.  We walk by the shop all the time, and it's always a question of \"should we get some?\".

I uploaded the picture next to a gift card for comparison of how small that slice was. Be ashamed of advertising something like this, because it was incredibly disrepectful to see something so small when your presentation in pictures is significantly misleading. I have screenshots from UberEats also to prove how misleading this is.  If you can't afford to provide decent portions, take it off the menu, or decrease the price.

We discovered SSR right before the pandemic and we are so glad we are able to have delicious and authentic ramen without going too far now.  This place rivals (and in our opinion, better) than Ippudo, Toto, and some of the trendy ramen places without the line.  Their plain chicken broth kodomo ramen is perfect for kids (and cheaper).  The summer/cold noodles are excellent.  Shoyu ramen is my favorite.  Highly recommend.",

Had the miso ramen with char sui and loved it. Flavor was spot on, pork was tender, everything was delicious. The sweet and spicy chicken wings were also yummy, and not too spicy either. Husband loved his ramen as well. Baby loved the decor haha. Wish they were in our hood, we would be regulars!",
