It\u2019s a family style restaurant and although it\u2019s a bit loud with kids all around, you can eat there and avoid the usual hectic ambience of food courts at shopping centers. It is a very convenient place to go after a long day of shopping, the service is very efficient, the food met our expectations and the decoration is plain.",
