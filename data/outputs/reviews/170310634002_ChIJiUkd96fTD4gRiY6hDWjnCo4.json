The one El Nuevo is serving is almost like 3 pigs in a blanket ( three little burritos). Nothing special. Chips are amazingly fresh and they serve it in a nice little sealed pouch. Did not try the margaritas since I'm not a big fan of it. Washed down my burrito with a Bohemia instead. Thank you.",

It strikes the perfect balance of cozy atmosphere, friendly and attentive service, and good food. Margs are good too!  I would recommend this place as a great go-to weeknight option or casual Friday night dinner if you forgot to make reservations. It\u2019s become my \u201cold reliable\u201d in the Lakeview neighborhood. I can come without a reservation, get a table quickly, and know I will enjoy good food.  I would give it 5 stars if the food was phenomenal, but to be fair, I am yet to find a 5 star Mexican food restaurant in Chicago, including all Rick Bayless restaurants!",

The not so good; server, queso fundido (was greasy and tasteless) asked server to take back, im not spending my hard earned money on something that's not great tasting.  He said he would not be able to take it off of bill and suggested we order something else. Ordered guacamole with carrots.  Guac lacked everything except avocado.  No onion, cilantro,  tomatoes.  Carrots came out much later; after dinner arrived. The fajitas came out without the extras, had to wait,  and they were bland, tortillas stuck together and also bland, food was  lukewarn. Service was less than attentive; had to ask for water refill and carrot appetizer(which the server informed me is $3 extra on top of the $10 tasteless guacamole. Skinny margaritas was $13 and flavorless and only two vegetarian options. Owner need not respond with apparent canned reply since previous poor reviews were not heeded.",

I made a reservation for four for a Saturday night. An hour later I called to change it to five. Less than an hour after that, they called me back to confirm. Then an hour before our dinner, they called me AGAIN to confirm. Once we arrived, we waited 35 minutes past our reservation for a table. What is the point in making a reservation, much less reconfirming twice, if you make people wait that long?  After seated, our server was rushing us along for our order, presumably to catch up with the schedule. Why were they not pressuring the prior table to move it along instead?  I will never go back. There are too many other basic Tex-Mex places with less hassle than here.",

I've tried just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed with my choice. The restaurant is very quaint and welcoming and in the summer the outdoor patio is just adorable. Now for the service, I rate the service 10 Stars. Everyone is welcoming and friendly along with being great servers. I'm local and close to the restaurant, but keep in mind it's Street parking only. Enough said, go try this place- I'm sure you'll have a great experience.",

For the prices, I would expect great food but it was terrible. I ordered the steak burritos and the plate consisted of three burritos that were about three inches, a spoonful of beans, a spoonful of rice, and a spoonful of salad. The price was $19 by the way. A friend ordered the shrimp and their idea of a garnish was alternated bell peppers and bits of parsley around the plate. It looked like a terrible chef was trying to create an elegant plate but failed miserably. Also, the salsa tasted like marinara sauce. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is not authentic at all. They don't even offer any Mexican drinks such as horchata or jamaica. I suggest going to a place in Pilsen such as Los Comales that has good food and even better prices. The owner should be ashamed of themselves.",

The guacamole is delicious. A perfect size appetizer for two people. I had the Carnitas De Puerco and my husband had the Combinacion Fiesta. Both entrees were great. I had a skinny margarita which was just okay. My husband had the house margarita. His was great. (I shouldn't have worried about the calories) Our waiter was friendly and efficient.

The 24 hour joints are way more generous and way less expensive.  Even the guac was off and a small amount for the price.  Chips were good,  but could have bought some at Jewel and heated them up.

For instance, I was initially going to get the Enchilada de Pollo en Mole Verde,  but after my date ordered it, I was scrambling for another choice. Our server made an excellent suggestion that was similar, yet different. So I ordered Enchiladas Crema De Chipotle. We also had guacomole. THE FOOD: The guacamole was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed blender smooth, and didn't have a lot of flavor. The Enchilladas de pollo en mole Verde was excellent. Really tasty, savory and well made. My Enchilladas crema de Chipotle was also very good. Rich flavor with a touch of heat. I really enjoyed it. Overall, an excellent meal in a nice, cozy place with nice people.",

        "caption": "Terrific Mexican restaurant in east Lakeview neighborhood. Wait staff is friendly and they don\u2019t rush you.  My wife had the plantains with a flavorful mole sauce. I had the chicken enchiladas with a delicious homemade cream chipotle sauce with a nice kick. The salsa is also homemade and is well done. All portions are very generous. The outdoor patio in back is fabulous. The mariachi band serenading the diners is excellent especially a young vocalist with a spectacular voice. Margaritas are also great. The pitchers are small though - it is served in a water carafe rather than a pitcher - My only complaint and reason for downgrade to 4 stars. Overall, a great place and will be back",

The reason more than simple is in the deep of the: what means \"Mexican Food\" so very big variety of traditional dishes on a great beatiful play of colors and too much tomato sauce! And that's why I'm giving the first star., The second one is on the real cornerstone of this place... The service, not only a \"great service\"\"great people\"\"I'll come back\" to explain the dimensions of hard work of this guys, waiters, bus boys, host etc. Tjey would against the clock to full your glass of water and ask for anything you need, that's no doubt that they work is amazing, that's your \ud83c\udf1f. Now the heart of this is the food, I understand that white people is predominant on this area, and some of this people are not familiar with the originality of the Mexican Food, the \"Mexican Food\" here has no flavor, and I really want to remark here, NO FLAVOR!! Sauce? Soup made it of tomato can? Mole from a glass can? C'mon!! Tortillas? Seriously? That thing is a tortilla? Do you guys knows the taste of a tortilla? You guys don't fool me hiding the taste of tomato \ud83c\udf45 can with a soup full of avocado, ingredients is what this restaurant needs in order to offer a real taste of Mexican Food. Being here was a shame, sorry but have to say, your food is bad, I try 5 of your dishes and the only thing I like was the entry \"queso fundido con chorizo\" not even the horrible cold tortillas. This is not to die on the line, is easy to change small yhings who eventually will bring a sea of difference on the food because everything is nice, the place is cozy, people is hardworking, and all those ornamentals looks awesome all around, the food is bad, and that's a fact.",

Some of us have allergies and others didn't like spice but the waiter was patient with us and made notes when we asked him to. We got the pitcher of margs - non flavored and they taste really good. I got thr enchiladas of carne asada and they were extremely well made. The portions are huge as well  They have a large patio in the back which they open up in the summer. The tables are made of chicken wire type metal so some things slip through / get stuck in it, ask for a platter in the middle for cutlery.  Overall everything was delicious, including dessert- I didn't think the tres leches cake was very authentic but it was tasty. Total was about 40 each for 4 people.",

A great place for a first date, especially after visiting lincoln park zoo as it is well within walking distance.  For the environment service and cuisine its affordability was impressive.  We were checked on regularly as far as service, and they deserved every bit of the tip me and my date gave them.  Five Stars!",

We got our entree fish BEFORE we got free chips and salsa- those came last, and before we got our appetizer and drinks. Never going back.",
