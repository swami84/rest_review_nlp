The Banh Mis are delicious (pork and lemon grass chicken). We\u2019ve also had the spring rolls and the summer rolls. Everything has been perfect. And the cleanliness during this pandemic is what has impressed us the most. Very clean, lots of hand washing, the owners wear masks and sanitize, and payment is contactless. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve found our \u201cgo to\u201d place for Vietnamese food. Highly recommend dining in car while everything\u2019s hot and fresh. Oh, we had the amazing beef salad but were gassy all night. Probably should consume this one while fresh, not after a car ride home.",

Last time I went I was in high school, and now I've been out of college for some time now. It was just as great as I remember. This place just offers some good, homemade pho. Is it family run? Not sure, but the people who work here are sweet. If the line is too long at Sweet Home, I don't recommend leaving! Hop over to this side of the lot and enjoy some bomb pho and thai tea. And spring rolls. And summer rolls? Honestly, everything. I want to come back to try a few other things that I've never seen or tried before, but we'll see when the world will pull me back here. It's just one of those spots, you know? Kind of a hole in the wall, not fancy at all or anything, but a darn good meal.",

I dont believe hes stupid enough to think hair follicles reach down to tendons therefore obviously looking for an excuse to save $4 of costs on a new bowl.

Papaya salad is not amazing but still good. Tofu summer rolls were a surprise hit. They also make a delicious tapioca dessert with either taro or banana in it.  The only thing not ideal about this place is the parking situation. They share the same parking as Sweet Home Cafe and some other restaurants so the parking is always full. However, there is usually some street parking on King Street if you're not there when it's tow away zone, which is 3:30-6:30pm.",

It's this tiny little hole in the wall across Sweet Home Cafe off of King St. I never noticed that it was even in that shopping center. I think that there are maybe 10-15 seats in the restaurant. We came right before the rush and there were a lot of seats available. We ordered the deep fried shrimp spring rolls & steak salad to start. Both were amazing! The rolls were hot, so let them cool first. The wrapper was perfectly crunchy and there was the whole shrimp inside the roll. The salad had rare steak, peanuts, basil, fried onions, & fish sauce. I'd come back here just for this salad! I had the tripe & rare steak pho. The broth was very nicely balanced with all the usual Vietnamese flavors. And the pieces of tripe were nice and big, no small little pieces I had to hunt for in my bowl. The also had their own chili sauce with lemon grass in the table, this was yummy too. Service was fast and friendly. Decor is a little cafeteria looking, but the food definitely is the star in this place. I'll be back!",
