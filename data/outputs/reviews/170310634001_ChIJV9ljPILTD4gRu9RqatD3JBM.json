I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tempura Udon and the K2 Roll for delivery. The Udon was nicely packaged so none of the tempura was soggy and definitely lived up to the \u201cspicy\u201d of its name! So yummy. K2 Roll had three different colors of Roe which was mostly just fun for me as a lover of roe. The fish was great quality and the portion was pretty good for the price. Both items were incredibly delicious. I\u2019m so glad to have found my new favorite sushi place in Lakeview!",

Nick greeted us with such warmth that immediately made you feel at home, he explained a couple of things to us and seeing how knowledgeable he was we decided to let him guide our night. He knew exactly what to bring us from the gyoza to the sashimi to the sake we drank and the mochi and green tea ice cream that finished us off. The cuts of fish were so fresh. The salmon felt like butter in my mouth and the tuna was soft as well. Honestly can't ask for more of a sushi place than this. If you decide to stop by give their hot and spicy chicken wings a chance too, they are fire. I was so full and couldn't think of eating more but when I smelled the wing I definitely knew I had to make room to taste it. Overall a great experience will definitely be coming back soon!",
