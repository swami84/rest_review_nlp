It's an open-air sitch and on a hot, humid day it didn't make for a good experience. They had giant fans noisily and uselessly blowing air. And in that environment I can't imagine how awful it must be in the kitchen. My guess is miserable. The food tasted like it was made by a person that was not enjoying themselves. All that and it was pricey as hell too. It was a terrible feeling using their ATM to get cash for an experience that I really ended up regretting. And the amount of cash I had to get out really stung.",

I ordered the sauteed squid, but a fried calamari appetizer was served instead. The squid ink pasta with seafood was acceptable. Not great quality seafood and several pieces of octopus were chewy and fatty. Even if it had been cooked perfectly, some aspects of service overshadowed the meal  There were several issues with service. The server brought out a bottle of opened wine, instead of opening it at the table - after mentioning it as one of the wines which they offer by the glass. The appetizer and entree arrived at the same time, and the service was generally inattentive.  I would not return for another meal. A disappointment.",

Despite the payment limitations, I still give 5-stars for the above reasons!",

Tonight, we were in the mood for Italian food, so I decided to give them another try, just in case they had a bad night back then.  I will say that the decor and atmosphere are very nice. Also, the staff seemed nice and eager to help. However, those are the only 2 good things I can say about the place.  Our table wasn't stable. The waiter noticed this and was very kind and gave us beer coasters to level it, but it'd be nice if they just fix their tables.  The bread wasn't great, the caprese  salad was ok.  We ordered 2 dishes of pasta. At first, only 1 came out- the Pappardelle Bolognese. The pasta was definitely under cooked- it was too hard and some of the pieces were sticking together. The sauce was bland and scarce. The portion was generous. Still, I'd expect more from an $18 pasta.  The second pasta dish (Spaghetti Puttanesca) only came out when I finished the Bolognese. The Puttanesca was too oily and didn't taste that great either.  The place only accepts American express. Otherwise, it's cash only.",

It was her first day- sweet but obviously not very experienced in the restaurant business. The hostess or manager kept coming over and talking to us. We ordered a nice bottle wine and three simple pasta dishes.  Two were just ok and the other had little taste The waitress returned asking again for the bottle we ordered, we told her again at some point it was brought to us - very good one. The pastor arrived at about 10:45 PM. 10 minutes later not quite halfway through our meal we were told we have to leave in five minutes because they closed at 11. The hostess came and proceeded to talk to us for three minutes so I we just assumed we need to be too much in a rush to leave exactly at 11. Wow! Were we wrong! We were told at 10:57 we need to leave they were closing at 11 we had to leave by 11 we haven't finished reading wish I had a half a bottle of wine but we were told we had to leave. This is not McDonald's. This is a high priced restaurant. We all asked if they were joking. They said no they lock the door and we had to get out. And then we got the lecture on why they closed at 11 and why we had to leave. Very bad rude people.",

Our terrible meal started with wine that had turned and ended with pasta so inedible it took me 5 minutes to swallow one bite. In an effort to not waste food, I tried giving my shrimp loving dog the shrimp and he flat out refused it also.  After seeing the wine and food was untouched, I was offered a doggy bag and the full bill. All of this I had simply chalked up to a terrible night out, but it all got so much worse once I posted a review explaining my experience on Facebook.  I woke up two mornings later to this exact response from the acqua santa, written at midnight the night before:  \"Sorry you feel this way but the server asked you if everything was and your reply was affirmative. Now you make these unfortunate comments which lead me to believe that you and your dog are spoiled by can food, maybe you should stick to that.\"  When I shared this disgraceful with my friends and my husband also left a review, the restaurant disabled us from leaving comments on their page and threatened to sue my husband.  Needless to say, this restaurant is one to avoid at all costs, your stomach, wallet and dignity will thank you.",

Service was great (French and Italian servers made for an authentic Brooklyn/European experience). Food was very decent. Pasta, Pizza, Fish, Salads. Straight forward menu, desserts looked great. A little on the pricey side, but if you're seated in the back very worth it!",
