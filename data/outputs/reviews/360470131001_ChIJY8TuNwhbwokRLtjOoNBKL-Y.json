When we got there, we were told to wait at the bar while staff prepared our table. We waited around 10 minutes before we were seated but never got our drinks - Even though we ordered drinks at the bar while waiting, the drinks weren\u2019t delivered to us until we sat down at the table and asked three times where our drinks were. We understood that the staff is working out their \u201cnew restaurant kinks\u201d and were patient. Regardless, the food was amazing: I ordered the grilled octopus and absolutely loved it. Perfectly seasoned and fresh, not to mention a big portion! Additionally, the red pepper and feta dip with pita bread was a delicious appetizer. I will absolutely be coming back, knowing the food is great and the staff will soon have have more experience under their belts!",
