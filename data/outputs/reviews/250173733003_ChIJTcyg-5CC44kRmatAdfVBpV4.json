We ordered chicken fingers, which had raw batter on the inside. We also ordered noodles in a \"garlic and wine sauce\". There was no sauce. When I tried to take the noodles out, it was one box shaped clump. Okay, it's New Years Eve. They are very busy. Things happen. So I called the restaurant and explained my issues. They said they would call me back. When they did, the woman tried to convince me that there is not supposed to be any sauce on the noodles. We did not get any further because instead of offering to fix the order, they tried to make excuses. That is why they are getting this bad review. Also, the food that was made correctly was very bland.",

Our go-to dish is the vegetable udon noodles with soft tofu, but if you want to he healthy, add some chili sauce & a bit of soy sauce to the steamed veggies with tofu.  The recently added sushi is simple but refreshing. Lots of fruit options and sometimes they'll make us an extra sushi salad!  We love to sit at the bar as a couple, but at a table when we come with the kids. The staff are very friendly. Service is amazingly quick.  The restaurant does huge amounts of take-out. Clearly a very popular spot. It's our regular neighborhood destination for Chinese food... we won't bother with any other place unless we're headed into Boston.  Parking is on street, metered. Close to commuter rail.",

We couldn\u2019t believe the food had come from the same restaurant. The Crispy Sesame Chicken wasn\u2019t crispy, with a gummy coating and meat so tough you needed a steak knife to cut it. The Pork Fried Rice was overcooked and greasy. There was no pork with Black Bean Sauce. Instead there was a very chewy beef with Red and Green Peppers and it was too late to go back to exchange it. This was a most unhappy dining experience. Too bad too for we like Chinese food very much and doubt if we'll try the restaurant again.",
