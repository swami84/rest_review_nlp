But when my favorite shop is closed on Sundays and I go to this one, I have found that 3 out of the last 4 times I have gone, something goes wrong with my order. Twice, there has been some disconnect between when I paid and the barista - so my drink wasn't being made and eventually I would have to ask about my order - the staff would be confused and have to ask me what I wanted and get started then. The last time I came in, my drink was not made correctly. The staff is friendly, but I rarely see these issues at any other Starbucks. I will start making coffee at home on Sundays.",

Arthur had a cool greeting for everyone who walked into the door...for me he said: \"welcome to YOUR Starbucks.\"  Debra was quick and very nice at the cash register. My food was made speedily and delivered directly to me since she remembered it was mine and not anyone else's order she placed.  It was a nice personal touch.  Arthur was very fun by letting the guests know what he was making next and said it in such a way that excitement for it was created. I did the most annoying thing (or one of them) of switch my hot latte to an iced one (before it was made though!) and he reassured me that he can make that happen for me and it was not a problem. Drinks were handed off with his cheerfulness and let the guest know that they were appreciated.  He pampered me with my iced pumpkin spiced latte being stirred with extra love. It tasted extra good since the ingredients were mixed really well. I left knowing that my day is going to the best now because of how it began. I work 3 jobs so I know how difficult it can be to be working around the holidays when everyone is having extra time off so I understand that it's easy to go through the motions of getting a job well done but they went above and beyond to create an atmosphere of what professional, kindness and  friendliness is all about.  If I had to describe what holiday cheer is, I would send them to Debra and Arthur.",

No greeting- that was o.k. - but asked a question, was ignored,  she finally responded and was not helpful. I then asked to talk to a manager and the manager completely answered my questions and was very helpful. The server then checked me out, asked her something else- she again ignored me. I stated that I never been treated so rudely. She said 'I guess you'll have to go to another Starbucks.' WHAT ???? This is totally UNACCEPTABLE.

I'm guessing this is why the line is always so short despite it's convenient location  Also watched about 3 cups of the nitro cold brew go down the drain today as someone turned on the tap to fill a cup and left it unattended for about 5 mins after the cup was full, so it just kept spilling out",
