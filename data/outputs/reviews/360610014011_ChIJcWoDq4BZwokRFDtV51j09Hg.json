To ship them at $72 for 2 dz is a disgrace. I would want to return them for a refund. I was offered $15 against some other purchase in the future instead of returning these but when I said to just credit it against this purchase, they refused!

However, when the food finally arrived it was not complete. I ordered three bacon, egg, and cheese platters with different bagels. The platters included home fries. None of my orders had home fries instead they all had three slices of tomato\u2019s. I called in as soon as I opened my order. The gentleman that answered the phone stated they had called me to inform me they were out of home fries. I took a look at my phone log and they had not reached out to me at all. Therefore, they had just lied to me, which is even more disappointing. I informed them I shouldn\u2019t have to pay full price for a platters, which weren\u2019t  complete. I also informed them I was missing a platter since it did not arrive with the correct bagel. I ordered a platter with an everything bagel. I received a platter with a plain bagel. The gentleman apologized and asked \u201cWhat would I like and he would send it?\u201d. I told him my correct platter, and a challah bread loaf for the inconvenience. He states it was not an issue, and he would be sending it out now. However, it never arrived, and worst he never called to inform me he would not be sending the order. Additionally, on seamless my total was $96. 76 with an applied $5.00 promo. Although, the paper receipt the total was 100.67. They did not honor the applied $5.00 promo on seamless for spending more than $60.00 dollars.   Yes, the actual taste of the meals we did receive was great; however, would of been nicer to have received my complete orders. I did report the issue to seamless, and at least they will refund me since this place did not.",

It also is the only place you can get freshly baked bukas and onion rings.  I remember getting this before they remolded the same store  back in the 90's .When I worked the area from 2200hrs to 0700hrs. You could get freshly baked bialy at 5AM. Sad to say after the modernization. It's just not same store anymore. Gone are the small onion rings,  gone are the big and small bulkas with onions on top. The smell and aromas are gone. Every thing is enclosed. The Bialy's have gotten smaller. I wasn't even tempted to eat one while leaving the store. .",

The two countermen from my prior visit were not there; instead the regular guys I am used to were behind the counter.  They filled my order and when it came time to pay, the young cashier, who was witness to my distress last time I was there, apologized to me and offered me my sandwich free of charge.  It was a very gracious and thoughtful gesture on her part.  Bottom line: I have been patronizing Kossar\u2019s for many years and they have the best bagels, bialys and lox to be found anywhere.   My upsetting experience notwithstanding, they are a great place to go to for authentic LES cuisine. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  I am a long time resident of the Lower East Side and have been coming to Kossar\u2019s pretty much all my life.  The food is wonderful; you name it: bagels, bialys, lox, all consistently delicious.  And the staff has been terrific, cordial and pleasant.  That is, until today.  My wife and I stopped in for breakfast and I ordered two bagels, one with scallion cream cheese and lox and the other with vegetable cream cheese and lox.  We got our order, and left with our bag of bagels and coffee and embarked on the 10 minute walk home.  When we got home and I sat down to enjoy my bagel with cream cheese and lox, I discovered to my chagrin that the guy who filled my order has given me cream cheese but no lox.  My wife\u2019s sandwich was similarly sans lox.  We both have busy schedules and simply didn\u2019t have time to make the trek back to Kossar\u2019s to exchange the sandwiches.   So we both ate our bagels with cream cheese.  Btw, I did find my receipt and it was clearly marked: \u201cNova lox: $19.50\u201d.  So we clearly had paid for lox but didn\u2019t get any.  I went back to Kossar\u2019s about an hour later on my way to the subway and explained to the young lady behind the counter.  She has always been very pleasant and was pleasant this time as well.  While she was looking up my order, however, one of the two guys filling orders (not the one who had taken my order) asked me, dismissively and in a very belligerent tone, \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you come back and return it right away?\u201d.  He then proceeded to make other comments and we argued back and forth.  Then the guy who actually filled my order started chining in and continued the argument.  I was heated myself and argued back, stunned that they simply didn\u2019t offer an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d; that\u2019s all they had to say and I would have been fine.  Meanwhile the lady at the cash register couldn\u2019t find my order (in my haste I had forgotten to come back with my receipt).  I got so fed up that I said the hell with it and just left without receiving a refund.  The irony is that I am moving away from the area and so wouldn't be coming to Kossar\u2019s much anymore anyway, but now I\u2019m absolutely never going back.  Again, it\u2019s very sad to cut ties with a lace that I have loved coming to all of my life.  But the totally disgusting lack of any respect is something I cannot tolerate",

Despite reminding them twice we still had a 3rd order. Two bagels were cut horribly (I'm talking 90% of the bagel on the bottom, 10% on top). The ingredients were all over the place and cut terribly. My sandwich only had salmon on one side of it, my \"shaved\" celery was 1\" cubes, and my tomato and onion slices were all random sizes, totally inconsistent. And, the bagel was chewy, tasted like it was from yesterday. Totally lame. Oh, and they were all out of the first 2 things I tried to order, but still uncharged me for the substitute.",

Maybe because I was a newbie then, but I still compare bagels to the ones I had in Kossar's over 30 years ago.  My son now attends university in NY and I told him about this place I went to for bagels. I didn't remember the name but remember the location. Thank you Google Maps for helping find it.
