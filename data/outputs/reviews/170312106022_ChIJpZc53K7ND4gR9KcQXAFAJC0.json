There was karaoke being performed that was so bad but ear splittingly LOUD I thought surely these people are joking and any minute someone is going to come over to me and point out where the secret production crew are trying to capture my reactions. Most people in the restaurant were looking around to see if this hellish performance was a hidden curse only they were experiencing. In what world could this be normal? Who thinks it's a good idea to project sad Spanish melodies in crude synthesized music at a level most concert venues would say is probably too loud? I'm not convinced I wasn't dreaming a dark reality. I will never forget it. That being said my quesadilla was delicious and I enjoyed my torta immensely, all beers are 6.35 regardless of brand (which is weird), and you need to turn down the freaking music.",

Well after going back and forth on what orange juice was we got know where. He said that he would would not refund me the money for the food and delivery. After more interesting dialogue he said he would come get the order and if it was not eaten would refund the 9$ but would not refund any thing else.

Upon entering the gloomy taqueria, you notice the flashing lights on six slot machines, a manager carelessly scrolling faceboom and some daytime drinkers strewn anout the bar. When you read the menu, your attention is called to the prices, which seem to have a decimal in the wrong place, when in fact the only thing in the wrong place is you. Burnt, cold and flavorless chips accompany their watery salsa as you glance at the door. Deciding against better wishes, you stay, and order a $4 horchata. Luckily its the same \"Klass\" brand you bought from walmart, so there's no new experiences to worry about. After ordering your food,  you try to put on some music to distract yourself from the quesadilla on its way, but someone didn't pay the juke box bill.  When the food arrives, you notice the cutlery is dirty, just like the tables and chairs. When you pick up your disappointment of a quesadilla it drips with oil, but not the pure olive kind, more like the secretions of a lawnmower engine. It's dirty guacamole side is old, like a nice cheddar, only guac doesn't age well. You go to the men's room, only to notice a decrepit ceiling, falling dryer and stained mirror before quickly deciding to just hold it in. When you finally finish what could be your last supper, the bill is a whopping $50 for the three drinks, three tacos, one quesadilla and a burrito. (Your three friends had accompanied you, but now you're blocked on Snapchat.)  If you don't believe me, fine. I invite you to go and see, then pay the price for your doubt.",

I have only survived on water and packets of relish that I found in a van in the Pinebarrens. I feel that there is a Russian out there watching me.  UPDATE3: I can barely type this. I haven't eaten anything but grubs in two months. I had to wash it down with puddle water instead of a nice Jarritos. This isn't how I am supposed to live. I am still hoping that one day this food will arrive.  UPDATE4: SOMEHOW I am still able to type. It's been over 3 years. I've given up. I mean look at me. I'm all bones. I need last rites. I would ask this place to send a Priest, but I know they won't show up. I bequeath my Vespa to my cat. So long cruel world.",

I finally decide to get something to eat from here because I\u2019m a mixologist and freelance writer. But I am also a big foodie. I ordered the ceasar chicken spinach wrap. And I ask for no onions it is like they put extra onions and gave me a regular tortilla. Also had no ceasar salad dressing on the wrap. Also was supposed to include a bowtie pasta and they gave me fries as a substitute without my knowledge or consent. I ordered the triple dummond cake which was supposed to be made as a three layer mousse cake (for those who have never had it). It turned out to be a stale (to be specific) slice of triple layered slice of regular cake. I also ordered a milshake and it was watery. Took them two hours to come and when they did arrive he wouldn\u2019t even come to my residence. Made me come out and walk to almost before he gave me the food. it was $17.04 he gave me the food. Then had the audacity to just walk off with my $20.10 making me tip him after a two hour air. And rudely and unprofessionally without even asking or attempting to return my change!  Joycena M.

She rolled her eyes and walked away, later returning with a pitcher of water. She came back a few minutes later to take our order. My husband and I ordered a chicken quesadilla to share, while our cousin ordered fish and chips and another basket of tortilla chips (which were an additional 25 cents). About 15-20 minutes later my husband and I\u2019s quesadilla arrived, with nothing else. We waited to eat because we figured the fish and chips would be arriving soon.. still no tortilla chips either (easiest thing to prepare on the menu, just grab and go). About 10 minutes after OUR food came, our waitress came over to ask how everything was, when my husband said we were expecting another meal, she asked what we ordered... we told her my cousin ordered fish and chips and it\u2019s been awhile, she said ok and to give it 10 minutes and it\u2019ll be out. We started eating and even finished before she came over 20 minutes later again. She asked if everything was ok, we just kind of blankly looked at her. She walked away anyway, without making sure we had our other meal, which we didn\u2019t. At this point, my husband was annoyed. It was 11pm and we were tired. He went up to the bar to talk to the waitress. She had never even put the order for fish and chips in, she just went to put the order in when he came up to talk. He told them to cancel it and he would like to pay the bill. Worst service ever. The chips were almost burnt and the quesadilla had a large amount of cheese. I won\u2019t say it was the worst food as well, but I would never eat there or recommend anyone to. Enter at your own risk!",

Food was late, ordered around 12:30AM and got it around 2AM ( 12 Wings, pop, and onion rings)  but that wasnt the worst part. The food was inedible..  wings had broken bones in them (Choking hazard).. and the Onion rings was a pile of grease. The only thing I could actually consume was the pop.. other than that everything else went into the trash where it belongs.  So sense it was so late (2AM) I was going to file a complaint the next day and ask for a refund. The Manager Octavio/ Victor was the rudest and most unprofessional person I ever spoke to. Not only did he not give me a refund he basically called me an idiot over the phone. Octavio didn't even apologize about the quality of my food.. The people that I talked to over their have ZERO customer skills and obviously don't want customers that are unsatisfied with there food, to ever comeback. . It was actually kind of funny because when I first asked to speak with a manger (Octavio/ Victor) to complain they just assumed the food wasn't delivered, So that means non-delivery and poor service happens often.. I will never order or ever suggest someone to order from this restaurant.  Repeat stay away from here and go to another restaurant on Milwaukee.",

The guacamole was ok but sure not worth the $8. They only gave us 2 baby containers of sauce and 1 fork. Our total was $37.59. I sure won't make the mistake of ordering from here again.

Just ordered a three taco dinner and a torta dinner from here, something even the most basic taqueria can get done with out failing but not this place.  First our order arrived 2 hours after placing it through grubhub, and ive gotten faster service from places farther away.  The food was obviously cold as a brick when it got here and then the meal that we paid extra for wasn't even there. Just the torta and the tacos, no rice, no beans.  this wouldnt even have been that bad had the meal price not been 3 dollars more than just the items we got.  So basically eat in if you're going to eat at all here that way you can complain in person.  Right now they're telling me they don't have a manager in and it's 6:00 pm on a Saturday.  What restaurant doesn't have a manager on duty during dinner on the weekend???",
