Working with the staff to schedule the dinner, decide whether to order off the menu or specify a menu and, generally, making the arrangements was easy with excellent communications by their staff.  We had never been there before and were surprised to see how small the restaurant is but extremely pleased that about half of the restaurant had been set aside for our party of 15 on a busy Saturday night.  The service we received was excellent and the food was very good. Everyone enjoyed the appetizers and the main courses which ranged from Italian food to steak. My son's father-in-law noted that he had one of the best rib-eye steaks he'd ever had.  We decided to provide some bottles of wine for the table and the server's suggestions for both red and white were also very good. It seems they have a very good wine list.  All in all, it was a perfect and comfortable evening at Bar Tano and served as a fantastic beginning to our wedding festivities.",

I came during dinner for a table for two before the big dinner time rush and was told to wait by the bar until my friend arrived. I thought this was weird because I had a party of two, not a group and the place was half empty. Several people came in while I waited the 5 mins it took for my friend to arrive.  When I told the hostess we were all present, she pointed to the tiny ledge behind the bar, which she acknowledged would be uncomfortable and told us we could sit there because there weren\u2019t any tables for two people available or sit outside where it was raining. Meanwhile there were two tables for four free. This is just unfair and it\u2019s not a good way to do business when you start to see customers as seats to fill and not as people.  Understand the desire to maximize the space but you shouldn\u2019t do it at the cost of tangible customers who are actually there and waiting before everyone else, especially ghost tables of four who don\u2019t even exist yet.",

First off, the location is good, the food and drinks seem good in theory, and the huge zinc bar top is amazing. It's one of the few zinc bars still around, and it has to be one of the longest zinc bar tops out there.  My wife and I visited once long ago, and had a decent experience. But then, we tried on two separate occasions to visit, and they were for some reason closed, even though their posted hours said they were open. The final straw was a recent visit with my buddy.  We were in on an afternoon, close to when they opened, and the bar was basically empty. I don't need to go through all the details, but the service was shockingly bad. The girl working was very very nice, and tried her best, but she obviously had had zero training. She really had no idea what she was doing, to the point of not even knowing what the shot of fernet and a peroni happy hour special meant. I mean, it's on the menu as a special! How does a bartender not know what this is? It was super disappointing, and I felt bad for her, but we won't be back.",

Then the management changed......and now the food, drinks, and ESPECIALLY the service have gone downhill. We will now walk out of our way to south slope for good Italian food. Disappointing. The last straw was when we sat at the bar for 15 mins without even being acknowledged (like just a \"Hello, I'll be right with you\") from the bartender. Unacceptable.",

What I got was scalding hot burnt-tasting cheese sauce over stodgy pasta. Absolutely nothing like a real carbonara. I couldn't taste anything other than cheese. Very disappointing.",

The service was attentive, the food delicious, and the decor wonderful. It looks like a little Italian bar out of the 1920's, with ornate plaster walls and ceilings, dark painted wood, and lots of glass and mirrors. I really enjoyed the rigatoni with sun-dried tomatoes, gorgonzola and capers. The prices are moderate, and the sun streaming in through the windows this afternoon made it the perfect place to sip an Irish coffee and linger over a book. If only it were closer to upper Manhattan, I'd come here often.",
