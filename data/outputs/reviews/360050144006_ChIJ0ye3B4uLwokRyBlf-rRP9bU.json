She shouldn\u2019t be serving your tables.  My overall experienced there is rushed! From the moment you walk in - they drop the menus, seconds later want to place your order! Once you eat the same! Being rushed! No time to actually enjoy your food!  The worse part! Is being asked for an additional tip! After you sign off your tab! The same waitress will argue with you as to why - you didn\u2019t tip her more!  Watch out for when you service charges added on your bill. At the lower bottom gratitude is also requested.  I\u2019ve witness many cases of her demanding customers for additional gratitude!  It\u2019s crazy in my opinion!  Her services should be reprimanded in many ways. Her behavior it\u2019s unethical!",

Next thing after we ate getting ready to leave the server came over and counted my money and basically demanded a higher tip after our service was sooo bad !!

The Martinis are great and the stuff was so nice.",

One warning is that even in the dinner area, the more of Hibachi shows can be a bit loud, even though they have glass separating the two areas.",

Well it started as soon as i got my salad with a tomato that had mold on it.  I didn't want to make a scene because by boyfriend was really trying to have a date night with me so I simply took it out and placed it on the side..I proceeded to eat the salad and it was so wilted and watery it was not edible, so i simply once again just pushed it to the side.  I had the watery soup with two mushrooms in it because at this point i was starving.  We then come to the appetizer shrimp tempura,  we get two shrimp about 6 inches long - i guess they roll them to be long - and one piece of broccoli one piece of zucchini and two thick pieces of potato - it was GROSS !! - I  then got salmon and shrimp - and to make this short and sweet i still have the slime of the shrimp on my tongue the next day - Hate to bash a beautiful restaurant in our neighborhood but after spending $115.00 and came home and ate coco pebbles for dinner.. I just had to share my experience.   NEVER AGAIN",

The chicken teriaki was so disappointing so bland chicken was not grilled no sauce and the veggies tasted like pure water. Seem as if they boiled the veggies and just tossed the chicken over them. Decor is nice but I was not there to eat pink and purple lights,stautes or any of decrorative items I wanted a decent tasting meal. it would be better if the food were good. Maybe the hibachi might better but the regular menu is trash we also had a picachu sushi,no sauce over it nothing no topping so dry and bland .68bucks to waste I was so upset!",

The wait staff was super friendly and very attentive.  The dining area overlooked the hibachi section.  Luckily we didn't go there because my review may have been different.  While hibachi is about entertainment, I don't believe there are enough chefs to pull off the amount needed to cover the tables.  The area was packed with people waiting over an hour+ to have food orders taken.  So if you are going there, pack some snacks and be prepared to wait.  The food is worth it though, so there's that.  Oh especially liked that they accommodated my grandma's special no slat diet restrictions and the food still tasted yummy.",

But the food was not that great very bland and plain, he never seasoned one thing with salt or pepper. I asked for pepper for my food and he looked at me like he's never heard of that before and replied with pepper??? He didn't have it on his cart with all the stuff he had to ask one of the waiters to get it and they brought back not the right thing, they gave me garlic.??? The portions on all the food were not good at all for the price you're paying for Hibachi and also why is Fried Rice extra for amount the food is and also no ice cream is included in your meal as well, ridiculous. That I did not like at all. It was just unbelievable to me that none of the food was seasoned with salt or pepper and the portions were terrible for the price you're paying.",

The food was pretty good just disappointing that you have to pay for rice separately which I\u2019ve never experienced in any hibachi place. Everything was cooked well but one of my issue was the wait time for service just to get our order placed. There was another set of family that were waiting for other members so we couldn\u2019t order even though my family was ready. Then once we were all seated we find that there were only two chefs and the place was full. I saw two sets of family leave because they didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. Then the family next to us get there and were just to busy getting up and out of there seats to make phone calls so when our waiter came to the table he has to come back again until the other person remain seated to take everyone\u2019s order. Now, My wife and I (female) we are a lesbian couple with two boys...My next issue was even though it was all for entertainment the cook jokes with a gentleman about his girlfriend and the man stated he was gay joking back. That is where the cook looks over to my 12 year old son and Refers him to kiss a child to prove he was gay. which I found absolutely disgusting and was I completely on guard to defend my child and felt that was inappropriate of him to say that. Joke with the adults and make all the gay comments you want I don\u2019t care but when it comes to children let\u2019s not involve them. Also, I\u2019m not one to have any allergic reaction to any food. However after ordering what I normally order at every hibachi place 10 minutes after I left the restaurant I ended up at the urgent care with a serious allergic reaction to whatever seasoning was used. Having to have a oxygen tank just to breathe and two shots for all the tracks on my body. NEVER GOING BACK!",
