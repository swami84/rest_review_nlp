My favorite restaurant Alfredo's showed me what they were supposed to be, but an abuelita selling them in front of Circle K every Wednesday made me an addict (don't ask what's in them - just bring an appetite & cash - abuelita don't take plastic!) Tamal is a very small shop & it's primarily kitchen. The daily offerings are printed on a board out front. Step in (smell the goodness), order, find a seat or take them to go & hope they don't run out before closing time! I've tried to eat here several times & did not make the cutoff - when the tamales are gone, they're done! And they're that Good! They stuff them with a variety of goodies that change daily - usually two meat offerings & a veggie. Today, we tried the chicken mole & a pork pozole. Mine was fantastic & I enjoyed watching my friend Suz'n bite into hers & see her eyes light up. How could this wonderful little concoction pack so much flavor that you just didn't want it to end - yum!",
