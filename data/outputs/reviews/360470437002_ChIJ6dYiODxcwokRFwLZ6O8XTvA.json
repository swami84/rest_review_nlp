Word of advice come hungry cause trust me you\u2019ll want to keep on eating - oh & make sure you save room dessert because their churros, and nutella cheesecake are to die for!!  I met the owner Solangi, she\u2019s super friendly and has the nicest welcoming staff! The restaurant is super clean and follows COVID  protocol and regulations.

The tables were way too close to each other, they even placed tables on the stage area next to the DJ. People smoking hookah were blowing the smoke on my face while I was trying to enjoy my delicious $2 taco and sip on my $2 margarita (Let's just say it's what you can expect from a $2 drink\ud83d\ude11 but it's not terrible). By the way the tacos were really good! They were a mix of cabbage some green sauce and very tasty meat - I was impressed and wondered how the rest of their food must taste?? They look really good in their pictures. We also had the chips with guacamole and they did not disappoint. The chips were freshly made and the guacamole was delicious (a tiny bit spicy). The waitresses were very accommodating and nice, although getting their attention was a little bit of a struggle at times. The only problem I had with this place is that it is way too loud. Happy hour is a time to mingle while ur having drinks and appetizers, I couldn't hear a word anyone was saying, including the waitress. I was screaming half of my time there. There was a live DJ with really good music, but honestly I was getting agitated from how loud it was. It felt like like I was at club, but no one was dancing. There was some small amount of dancing later on, in the evening, but that only lasted for like 20 mins. Overall I woud like to come again, but I am hesitant to come on a Tuesday. Overall this may not be a place to have a conversation unless you know sign language.",

Ordered the seafood paella, tool a chunk of meat out of the lobster tail and the smell of ammonia made me gawk. It wasn't slight, this lobster smelled like it was dipped in ammonia. That's how strong it was, everyone knows why, or WHEN, I should say, seafood starts to smell like ammonia. How old was that lobster tail I just ate? I had plans to bring friends back to this restaurant to try other stuff, not anymore, one can only wonder what goes on in the kitchen. Honestly, if I get sick tonight, if I feel the slightest disturbance in my stomach, I'm going to the E.R and a lawsuit will follow because stuff like this can kill someone. I mean I honestly pulled the meat out this lobster tail and now the whole cab of my truck smells like ammonia. I might even call the health department and submit a report.",

We went to this place for an event to see Aljadaqui... since we arrived at 10pm we were early for the event which was set to start at 11pm and decided to eat first. The service is horrible we had to wait too long to place drink and food orders and the wait staff is not knowledgeable about the food or drinks. When we finally received the drink orders we had to send one back three times because it was incorrect... how the hell do you mess up a margarita?!.  I will say the food is good. The drinks were not. After eating we decided to stand by the bar where all the chairs had been removed. While standing at the bar at one point I truly thought that we were in an episode of bar rescue before the bar had been rescued. It was mayhem everything was so disorderly...it looked like the staff was not properly trained to handle this event or any event. They had one bartender making drinks and she would just give the drinks away and not charge. We paid our bill in full because we are honest people but if we wanted we could've left without paying a dime. In fact when we asked for the bill the bartender only charged us for three drinks at the bar and we told her we also ate. On the flyer it said the band was to play at 11pm but they didn't start their set until 1230am and it's not because the band arrived late since we saw when the band arrived which was at the same time as us there was no reason for the late start. I can safely say that I, for one will not be returning to this place or recommending this place to anyone I know and they should consider hiring more employees and putting a call into the producers at Bar rescue for some advice. Good luck",

Looks like you & your whole team could use some Customer Services Training.  Lets start by saying It's my right to give my review of MY EXPIRENCE to any restaurant I been too Included yours whether you like what i say or not. That why there is a review option. whether i spoke to the manager or not should be muted. I was a paying customer with receipt to prove it.  Second,  Do you really think that u are going to catch on camera ur waiter giving me altitude from a camera that is located 10 feet high in the the ceiling. Lets get real. your basically giving me the round around. Do you have camera on eye level in every table with audio? if u don't I highly don't it.  Third, why don't you focus on things that u could prove like the gradituty  on my bill. I'm sure ya still have the receipt. I'm so over this place. rest assure  I will be telling every one I know  the service I receive & still receiving.  OlderPost: I came out this place livid. Worst experience ever, Since we got there the waiter was rude. We ask a simple question; what drink she recommended, her reply \"the menu is there, look at it\". N it just continue to get worst from there. Every time we ask for something we was cut short or ignored. Our drinks took over 30 minutes to be made & when we ask for napkin to place our forks it never arrived. Our bill came up too around $400. When I check the bill they had added gratuity. It clearly said in the menu that gratuity will only be add in group of 6 or more. We were only 5. We ask the waiter why was it on the bill. Her response was ask the manager and walked away. didn't bother calling the manager or anything.  The service was not worth the  18% gratuity I was charge.",

        "caption": "We were so excited to see Barchaa open as there are still few nicer restaurants within walking distance.  Overall friendly yet seemingly inexperienced staff and average food.  As they're in their second month they still have some kinks to work out and I'm sure will continue to refine the menu.  We'll give it another shot for brunch sometime soon as I'm really pulling for this place.  Ambiance - overall an attractive space decked out in exposed brick and reclaimed wood like many a place in Bushwick.  We came in on a Sunday at 8PM and the music was blaring so loud we had to sit on the same side of a 4 top to hear each other.  This was a bad way to start things off.  The music was also being played from an unmanned turntable so songs would end and someone would have to hop back to get another one going.  kind of weird.  Food - we ordered just apps & a salad so it's possible we didn't try the best on the menu.  The meal started with some little friend breadstrips and a spicy mayo sauce as complimentary.  Really tasty and a nice touch though the sauce came in a to-go plastic cup feeling a bit cheap.  We then had the grilled lettuce salad (basically BLT), wings and the ceveche with shrimp and scallops.  All the protien s we fresh and well cooked.  Where they fell down was on sauces.  There was a ton of BBQ sauce glommed on the wings that was really sugary.  Way too much dressing on the salad and the ceveche was way more sugary than we personally enjoy.  Drinks - I got one drink called the Hermenia that was a mango base.  It was delicious!  Service - lots of little things showed inexperience: - 30 seconds after we arrived a server brought us someone else's drink order - our server appologized that our waters too so long (they didn't) saying they were very busy earlier as an excuse. - we were seated in the back and half way through our meal they asked if we wanted to move to the front of the restaurant.  Felt strange and we were left wondering if they wanted to look more full - my water was cleared when the plates were cleared at the end. - no pen in the check book  The only other thing I'd add is the silver wear is about as cheap as it gets.  I hope they reinvest in a different set once the place is established.  I'd love to check this place out on a Friday or Saturday night as I'm sure it's a super fun Latin vibe.  As you can see from the above a lot to work out but good potential as well to become a neighborhood favorite.",

Very nice salad and presentation. She\u2019s picky, and didn\u2019t even want to go in, but now she said she\u2019ll be back, and I definitely will be back. Nice atmosphere and the food is very high quality. A couple of fancy cocktails, (non-alcoholic I guess they\u2019re waiting on the liquor license as of mid-August). I don\u2019t drink so it was all good, very nice. Coconut flan for dessert topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherry. We knew we were in for something good when they brought these delicate bread stick appetizers with an amazing dipping sauce. Great spot.",
