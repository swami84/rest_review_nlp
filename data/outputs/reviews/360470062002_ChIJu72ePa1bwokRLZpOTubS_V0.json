We were informed by the waiter, all the steaks are cooked medium.  and he specified NOT Med Rare....Medium.  I found  this very strange, not wanting to be picky, I said ok  The steaks  were not seared on either  side, they looked very weird...like a beige color with two little grill marks  there.  One of my friends couldn't even eat hers, she felt it was not fresh...we come to find out they were  probably precooked when shipped   that's probably why they could only be cooked  Medium.  The guest of honor was served short ribs. She ordered Prime Rib! Service was close to a zero. Once the water took our food order, he never come back to our table. We had to  keep asking the Bus boys when we can catch them for the essentials such as Steak Knives, salt and pepper. water, Later on, we were told he was handling a big party in a private room..ahhh i see, so the hell with us. They did take the one steak dinner off the bill. they didn't even offer to adjust the bill for the inconveniences. I brought the check to Maryann paid cash munis a tip. i explained  why no tip and she wasn't surprised at all....I then handed her $20.00, this is for the bus boys  who took care of us. My friend's Birthday was ruined. but we took the Birthday Cake we brought there and havd desert and coffee at my place .  The food was not what we expected from this place  at all. The service was horrific. THE ONE STAR IS FOR THE BUS BOY'S  TOOT A LOO PEARL ROOM",

The fried Calamari was terrible and the sauce was inedible. Lobster cocktail, coconut shrimp and the oysters were good, but very cheap on the portion size. Striped Bass was absolutely inedible. It was so bad I had to spit it out. It wasn\u2019t bad fish, it was just way overcooked with a horrible taste.  The Chilean Sea Bass on the other hand was delicious. The vegetable risotto was tasty, but not cooked correctly. Was more like veggies and rice. Overall very bad experience. To top it off my bill was $158 and some change. I gave $200 and the change given back was $40. I understand it\u2019s a dollar and change, but who does that? That two dollars was deducted from the already poor service tip. Place is not the same.",

He comes back and says ok what would you like? My husband and I said we already ordered he said can you tell me again? We said no we been here for an hour and haven\u2019t gotten anything . As we got up and walking out the same waitress \u201cmanager\u201d says please don\u2019t leave. We explained how long we have been sitting waiting for our food. And she says because we make everything fresh. My husband then tells her it doesn\u2019t take that long to bring out appetizers. She says oh you ordered appetizers? She goes oh no I forgot.

When she takes it out, it was metal, little parts of metal were IN her food. What type incompetence level do you need to have to get metal scrap inside your customers food. And then the waiter had the AUDACITY TO SAY \"I'LL GIVE YOU $20 OFF\" Absolutely not. Insult to injury?

The service was awesome everyone enjoyed there meals, Most of us had Stake, best I\u2019ve ever had so fresh and tender. I also got to taste some of the other dishes the chicken parmigiana, on point, crispy and so far from dry it was perfect, The Penne Al vodka with shrimp was flavorful. It was a new experience for my group and we definitely enjoy ourselves. No one bothered my friend who was just up and about dancing alone while we waited for our food, lmao. There was a DJ there mixing some old school joints we all sang along too. Ended the night with dessert & coffee which was just what we needed to boost our energy  for the after party. Shout out to the manager Iggy had some confusion with my bill, she was so patient and explained everything to me in detail. The staff at The Pearl Room is definitely doing its thing keep up the hard work. Highly recommended. The Puerto Rican\u2019s will be coming back.",

Our food took a while to come out but it was well worth the wait. I dont understand how there are bad reviews about the pearl room because mothers day is the busiest day of the year. To me a busy place is a good place to be. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the beef wellington which melted in my mouth. my husband ordered the bacon chicken which was to die for   I actually ended up eating some from his dish lol. We then ordered chocolate truffles for dessert which we always get because there truffles are amazing. The owner came at our table towards the end of our meal to make sure that  we were completely satisfied. I give this restaurant 5 stars for being able to serve the most delicious food on the busiest day of the year!!",

We were seated then asked to move to make room for a large party.   Service was slow and inattentive.

We did not get our first dance because the music set up was horrible nor did we get to even cut our cake because the main course was not serviced till after 10pm in which guests were already leaving. I had to tell them to take the cake and just cut it. The ONLY good thing I can say about this place is that the room available to rent is beautiful. That's it. I will NOT recommend this place if you are an organized individual who wants to have a nice wedding reception dinner (food was just okay). They were NOT ready/prepared for a larger group. I look back on this day with so much regret and disappointment It makes me want to cry. One advise I can give anyone who is thinking of having their wedding dinner here is to RUN!",

Despite being a classy nicely decorated restaurant, management is going to have to fix their heating system or I won't be back.  The food is not that good to sit in the cold.

Giving them the benefit of the night I had a red wine. The bottle was not refrigerated and my $9 glass tasted sour and warm. There was about 7 patrons and 7 staff. The bartender hounded my friend to get another beer but we were not staying. By 1am the DJ told her he was packing it up. The DJ music was loud with to much annoying electric sounding howling of his name. The person who recommended the place is bad. Should have read the poor reviews here.",

If not, then run, and look for a better place in  Bay Ridge, There are so  many other resteurants to choose from. Our mistake was that we didn't take the reviews seriously.  It cost us over $100 but it was a lesson learned.  BTW-one of the appetizers listed Maryland Style Crab Cakes. (plural)  When the dish came out, there was one lonesome crabcake the size of a half dollar.  When asked why only one, when the menu alluded to more,  the reply was that's  the way it is.
