A bit more than I expected. 2nd visit was quite different and a bit disappointing. No buffet at all, limited deserts, order filled incorrectly. Sandwich was remade, quite well and overstuffed to make up for any inconvenience. Still have a problem with prices. I refused a slice of apple pie that they wanted 3.5 for. Happy day after the 4th.",

The restaurant is quintessentially American in composition. The buffet features an astounding melting pot of choices from all over the world. My spelling is atrocious and I am going to refrain from using inadequate descriptions such as \"spicy pickled cabbage\" to describe one of the items I know I can't spell (yet I did...oops).  Made to order sandwiches are also available here, but I have yet to try them because the colorful and flavorful buffet reigns supreme for me! The reason that I am an \"off and on\" customer is that this delicious food is sold by weight and I don't believe in wasting a single morsel of food. I would create huge plates daily and have to buy new clothes if I were a regular.  The best thing about Kings Garden is that they do not offer an \"all you can eat\" option. Doing so would make some customers focus on quantity consumed rather than the quality of what they get. And an example of adjusting to suit the customer was in evidence on my last visit. I noticed the fresh pineapple slices were cut smaller. I'm sure this was a product of conscious evolution. Please try this success story in progress!",

A table with a huge selection of cold food and salads and another with hot dishes including meat, chicken dishes mainly, but pork, spare ribs and salmon also on offer). Various cold/hot pasta dishes on offer.  A sandwich bar offers freshly made (to order) & coffee/Sushi/soup stations offer plenty choices, this includes the cold Chinese teas.  They have some 14 tables to eat in, so don't be afraid to grab a tray. The park outside can offer a refreshing place to eat your food in summer months. If I remember right the add some tables outside, otherwise go upstairs and enjoy a more relaxed seating (available) with exit to the upper walkway to the buildings.  Today is my second visit. I decided to try a taste of all the meat dishes on offer. Not disappointed, specially when staff from the restaurant went outside with some food to offer free to a \"person in need\" and also to his dog. Well done!",

Although many choose to take their food outside and eat at one of the small tables provided by the city at Center Plaza- just outside of Kings' entrance. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Food is priced by weight and I usually get out for an under $6 lunch , but it's possible to stack up the cost if you're hungry. The food is standard Americana with a Korean flair.",
