The restaurant is run by a husband and wife team, who do an excellent job preparing and serving dishes while engaging with patrons.  Sushi You is only omakase (chef's choice) style, so there is no menu. You simply sit down and enjoy a series of dishes that are brought to your table. (Our dinner included sashimi, sushi, chawan mushi, salad, miso soup, and several other plates.) We were told that the fish is flown in from Japan, and the quality is excellent. The fatty tuna was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Just a caveat: like other omakase places, dishes are served at a leisurely pace. So don't eat here if you're in a rush, as a meal can take 1 1/2 to 2 hours from start to finish.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol, so it's strictly BYOB. (And Times is right next door if you forgot to bring your favorite adult beverage.) Also, water and tea are self-serve.  Parking is plentiful in the Times lot. The restaurant is on the smaller side, so reservations are recommended, especially for special occasions.",

They only do omakase Sushi but for $80 the amount and quality of food your receive it\u2019s well worth it (not to mention it\u2019s byob). Sushi You is run by an elderly husband and wife couple to who make and serve everything themselves so water and glasses are self serve. Would recommend making recommendations if you want a seat... especially one at the bar!",
