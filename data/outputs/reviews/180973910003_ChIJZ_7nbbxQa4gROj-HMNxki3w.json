Very awesome valet and gave me a nice refreshing bottled water. Valet was under $20 that time I arrived. Nice foyer as your walking towards the next set of doors. I was greeted by a very sweet host, Katelyn(my apologies if I misspelled). I was allowed to choose the bar, high tables or traditional seating level. Decided the high tables for lunch. Ordered the following: ribeye done in medium paired with a glass of pinot grigo(I appreciate your recommendations, Katelyn). Finished up with Caramelized crusted cheesecake. Had the onion soup with Havarti(or was it Gouda) on top, to go. Overall, 4.9 \ud83c\udf1f stars out of 5. The truffle French fries, I was hoping to have some tiny pieces of truffle, however, I think it was simply cooked with truffle oil. Every piece of food or drink was greater than par with an exception to the truffle fries(bogey +). Katelyn, I think you are an excellent host! \ud83d\udc4c I should of ask if they had Chicago style steak seasoning. Couple minutes prior to doneness and seasoning will be perfect after a nice rest. To the Capital Grille, much appreciation for a delightful time and atmosphere for lunch. I strongly want to experience their breakfast setting. To my Ku'uiPo ViVi, i apologized I snuck away from you to experience some alone time for this one.  -marlon sends",

I also tried the mashed potatoes, they were flavorful but not too rich. The desert platter was amazing, it came with a flourless chocolate cake that had a slight fudge consistency and coffee taste. It also had strawberries in a creme sauce which wasn't too sweet and a marvelous creme brulee. My favorite thing on the menu was the creme brulee, it was spectacular!",

A nicely done sauce but the shrimp and the bread were both over cooked and difficult to cut even with a butter knife.  The lobster bisque was average at best and lacked flavor.  The medium rare steak was more rare than medium. The lobster lacked flavor.  The cream spinach was so overly salted we sent it back.  We were told that the chef agreed that it was over salted and asked if we wanted something else.   We were puzzled that the chef didn\u2019t taste it before it left the kitchen.  They did have a nice stirring stick that was covered with sugar crystals that was very creative.  The cream and strawberries were ok.  At the expense we probably will look elsewhere on our next trip as we were disappointed with the cuisine.  Once again, the service was fantastic but the culinary experience was lacking.",

The atmosphere is so pleasant and the service is so friendly. Dave was very prompt about greeting us when we arrived to be seated and quickly got us water and drinks. I typically refuse to sit near the kitchen, but we were seated there last evening and it wasn\u2019t so bad at Capital Grille. The kitchen wasn\u2019t overly loud and the staff weren\u2019t so boisterous as I\u2019ve encountered in the past elsewhere. Our server was John. He was knowledgeable and informative about the menu options and specials. We started with the pan fried calamari. Oh, my! There was just so much of it! It was cooked to perfection and the pieces were of good size. Each piece was buttery delicious. My husband ordered rack of lamb and ordered salmon prepared Oscar style. We also ordered asparagus and lobster mac n\u2019 cheese. The main course was just so fantastic! The lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare, as ordered, and the flavor was just delicious. My salmon was even more enjoyable than I anticipated. The sides were delightful, too. Now if you\u2019ve never had lobster mac n\u2019 cheese, you need to absolutely taste Capital Grille\u2019s take on it. So heavenly! We were celebrating my husbands birthday and John was most accommodating helping me do something special. The plate John brought out had Happy Birthday stenciled on it in chocolate and contained a small round serving of flourless espresso cake and another small round serving of cheesecake, with some slices of fruit. All were fantastic! The photos of the food don\u2019t do it justice. If you\u2019ve never been, know that the all-around experience is certainly worth the expense. The food will knock your socks off!!",

He was very patient & helped guide us through the menu. He had several recommendations & knew the answers to all of our questions without hesitation. The whole staff at the restaurant was so nice & we were wished \"Happy Anniversary\" by the people at the front, other servers walking by & Tyler multiple times. They had a single long stem rose, a hand written card wishing us Happy Anniversary & all servers signed their name to it & heart confetti on the table. Me & my husband both ordered steaks which were cooked perfectly & great! We also shared the lobster Mac & cheese, which is to die for! Seriously the best lobster Mac & cheese we have ever had!! It is a \"must order\" side dish!!  After our delicious dinner, Tyler brought us a complimentary anniversary dessert with 2 glasses of Champagne to top off the experience. Our food was delicious but the experience there was even better. We seriously felt like celebrities, even though we are far from it lol! We will definitely be back to The Capital Grille! Thanks for making our night simply amazing!",

I don't even have room to type out all the wonderful food and drink we had. I will say this, the cocktails are STRONG. That might not be to everyone's taste, but for a special night out with friends, it was perfect.",

All three were undercooked by at least a magnitude of two. Which, ok, you can always send your steak back to be cooked more but at this level/price of restaurant, I expected them to know how to cook a steak. In addition, two of the steaks appeared to be sized correctly, the third steak was  much smaller and looked  more like a 6 oz, which was frustrating. My biggest concern was one of sanitation.  We had three different assistant servers stop by to fill our water glasses, only one did it properly by picking up the glass at the base. The other two put their hands around the rim of the glass. This may not be an issue to others but I am a slight germaphobe and it was very disconcerting to me. Since this happened with 2 out of the 3 assistants, it's clearly a systemic issue and makes me question their other sanitary practices.",

The lobster mac was the best side dish we've ever had. The mashed potatoes were great. My son wanted orange juice and I didn't expect it to be fresh squeezed, now that's fine dining. Our server did a great job. We highly recommend this restaurant. And the cheesecake was divine. It was worth spending over $200 here. The only little issue we had was finding a parking spot. Valet parking was the best way to go with.",
