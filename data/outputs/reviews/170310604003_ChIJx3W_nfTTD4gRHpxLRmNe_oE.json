The price is reasonable, but it can get expensive. The server is really nice and friendly. However, the owner/cook is very UNPROFESSIONAL. Here's the reason: We went there at 2:55pm and we realized they opened at 3pm (they changed from 12 to 3 for open on Sun). We were standing outside in the cold until it opened. Although we were surprised they didn't let us in, we were fine. A few minutes later, a woman comes and tells us she's a server here. She tells me only the owner has the keys and we can't get in. She says she comes in 30 minutes before the restaurant opens and waits for a while. She explains he's ALWAYS LATE and he doesn't listen to her. She texts him we're here, but the owner/cook did not show up for 30 minutes. He came to open 25 MINUTES AFTER THE RESTAURANT SAYS IT OPENS. When he showed up, he was smiling like this was a joke. And he kept making excuses. You'd think they'd at least give you a discount or something, but they didn't, which is fine bc we probably won't go back. If the friendly server wasn't there to talk to us while we waited, and be so nice throughout, we definitely would have left. Who shows up HALF AN HOUR after the OPEN TIME to their own restaurant EVERYTIME?? If that's the case, they should change the hours.",
