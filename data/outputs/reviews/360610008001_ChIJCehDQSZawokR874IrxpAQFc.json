If you fail to do that, apologize and say that it no longer is. There is no need for an attitude. I didn't purposefully go looking for things so you'll actually have to get up from your perch 10 feet away, come over and let me know that something is not sold. Or just don't sell it if it's gonna cause a serious problem......  I also don't believe its a good idea to yell at people when they didn't tip your suggested amount especially causing a scene in the middle of a street. This is just poor form. If you don't like it and if I were to happen to return (I wouldn't have anyway) then reduce the service. That said scenes were started, mistakes, were made and here we are with this review announcing the waitstaff here have severe attitude problems.  Pro Tip? There's a perfectly good Shanghainese restaurant right next door. The red cooked pork is fire and the xiao long bao are not half bad. No attitude, no questions asked, they get my full middle of the road 20% tip.",

You have to make your presence known to the servers  Other than that, it's definitely a 4/5",

I love the screaming in Cantonese in the kitchen because that is what makes it old Chinatown, not catering to the tourists and American Chinese generations like me. No organic, just fresh made to order meals. NO frills but truly HK...the decor might frighten some. Now the food, I like their congee, fish ball curry and rice noodles minus PB though.

One IMPORTANT tidbit that you should have before you go: You must flag down your waitress to take your order, if you do not do this, you will not be served. I don't know why, this wasn't something I ran into anywhere else in NYC but right before I got mad and walked out an Asian lady sitting beside us told me this and as soon as I tried it, the service and food was very fast! My husband and I both got the ham omelets with fries, toast and a drink and our total was only $10.15! The food was great and a great value! If you are riding a bus into Chinatown this could be the perfect place for you to stop for food before going into town!",

Honestly one of the only traditional HK style breakfast places left in Chinatown with lots of seatings and gives you the HK vibe of a restaurant. The places is filled with photos of HK stars who have came here to eat so you know this place is legit. This place has what I believe is the best beef fun noodles, and iced coffee.",

        "caption": "Pros: 1. Small and cozy place. It's got a small family feel to it. Typically I go once or twice a month at most and have had long stretches of not going. But the staff there remember me and be quite hospitable. 2. Great food. It's essentially a Hong Kong version of, not fast food, but quick service, highly comforting food. There's an array of breakfast items, steamed rice rolls, noodles, drinks, rice dishes, etc. The portions are reflective of most Chinese dining establishments. 3. Reasonable pricing. In all the time I've been their customer, about 7 years, I dont think their prices have risen. The breakfast deals are definitely a must try for the value of it as well as the \"homey\" feel.  Cons: 1. This is half a con - there is usually a 15 minute wait during peak hours. That makes sense since the place is so good! Just be cautious that if you're starving, dont expect a table right away during peak hours.  Personal input: I absolutely love their French toast. Note that it is NOTHING like the American version. This is light and fluffy on the inside and deep fried, then topped with a slab of softened butter and maple syrup.",

Seven minutes later, another table came. I looked at the phone and ordered fried rice at the first table, and fried noodles came out. I turned my face to look at the stage station. The food on the first table came later than me. The waitress reminded the chef inside that there was a Yangzhou fried rice that had been waiting for a long time. I waited until the second table was almost finished. I had been waiting for almost 24 minutes, get up At the front desk, I urged it and said that it was because I didn't see my order, and I forgot it. This is how bad my memory is, and how could I forget it when I was not busy ordering. The fried rice that was fried in this way also disappointed me. The fried rice was horrible.

Everything's pretty good and reasonably priced. Some of my favorites include HK steamed rice rolls, congee, macaroni in soup, and pork chop over rice with curry sauce. Make sure to get the half coffee / half tea iced drink. It's done correctly.",

When my party ordered, the waitress didn't write one thing down! After taking our orders, I was very worried that she would mess something up, and watching her go to another table to take another order made me worry even more.  When the food came to my table, everything we ordered and added extra was made to perfection and executed like a hit man.  Damn this waitress had good memory, I only wished my memory was as good as her.  Ordered from the breakfast special (morning -11am) combo A toast and spam omelet.  You can get a cup of coffee with the combo, or add $1 for ice coffee/milk tea, and ordered a side dish of HK style steams rice noodles (soy and peanut sauce). Friends ordered Combo D- Ramen and toast, and french toast.  Even if the place is packed, the food came quick.  Food tasted really great.  It definitely tasted like authentic Hong Kong style brunch and high tea time meals.  Decor of the place reminded me of some authentic spots in Hong Kong.  Called M Star cafe, they were trying to copy an actual restaurant in Hong Kong owned by movie stars.  Not sure if this has any connection, but their decor is painted with popular HK pop and movie stars.  I can see that they started their wall of celebrities who have came to visit.  I can only hope more movie stars come to visit this solid spot.",

Order that plate and look at the portion, look at the sauce being poured, this is HK Fusion in New York.  Though they don't have every possible item you can order from Hong Kong, it certainly is more than sufficient. The interior design is also very special and lively with some of the most famous actors and singers as comic drawings.",

Something is definitely still missing though.  Probably the hustle and bustle outside.  Or.. the PEANUT BUTTER in my french toast. -_- haha I guess here you have to specifically order it with the peanut butter?  It was still really filling though.  The milk tea is definitely not the best.. like some other yelpers say.  The best milk tea is definitely STILL in hong kong itself.  NO ONE CAN COMPARE!  The place is not that huge and they didn't have the a/c on while I was there on a hot summer day.",

They have green plastic chairs that are surprisingly comfortable and the service was decent. This place doesn't get too busy, so you get your order generally pretty quick. I really like their accent wall where it depicts a bunch of HK celebrities in caricatures and it's fun trying to identify everyone. The food was pretty good and tasty. I would definitely go back to check out some of their other dishes because I didn't get everything I want from the menu.",

        "caption": "Walk toward Division St. in Chinatown and you will find this blue-tiled restaurant, very unique since it stands out from the rest of the other restaurants that are there. M Star Caf\u00e9 is a Hong Kong based caf\u00e9 that serves some of the common western breakfasts, like ham and macaroni, but with a slight Asian twist. Why \u201cM Star\u201d you may ask\u2026well, because when you walk in, you will see caricatures of Hong Kong movie stars and artists (musicians) on their wall. The life-like characters (at least the head part) are not only recognizable by many Chinese people, but these characters are drawn with elongated bodies that make them look oddly weird, but entertaining. I usually frequent this place for breakfast, but they also serve lunch and dinner. My recommendation would be the Portuguese baked chicken over rice dish, since I feel like this dish has a better representation of east meets west fusion. Prices are reasonable since it\u2019s under $10. They make some of the finest milk teas, especially when tea is not watered down, so the milk tea is pretty caffeinated to get your day going. Service, however, lacks a little since the waiters are always on the rush, so they tend to forget a lot. They can completely forget your order, or misplaced your order, but in general, they still serve some good tasting meals.",
