The guy who was taking orders literally didn\u2019t speak English almost at all, so the language barrier was too difficult to overcome. Besides that, more than \u2153 of the food advertised on the menu wasn\u2019t being served or was simply \u201cout\u201d. It was very frustrating to ask for the food I wanted 4x or 5x and STILL not have the man understand what I was ordering. On top of that, the man taking the order was very impolite and it seemed like we were bothering him by trying to place our order. Maybe he was as frustrated with the language barrier as we were. I didn\u2019t know. We wound up walking out, simply because I wasn\u2019t able to place an order. Added photo as proof that I was actually here, and to authenticate this review.",

I ordered a pound of PAKORA FISH and the guy charged me $16 instead of $12 coz he put some extra fish in the container. When I got home and opened it, there were 4 huge pieces of LEMON inside. He weighed fish and lemon together for the price of fish. They over charge and the taste is also bad. STAY AWAY.",

I went in around 8pm and the worker at the counter was hanging out with his friends rather than coming to take my order. This is not a family place anymore. They have random guys going into the kitchen and talking very loud about their own personal business. The food is still the same and taste good. I hope the owner teaches his workers to be professional and dont allow random guys to walk behind the counters and kitchen. I'm sure the good reviews are from friends of the owner but please be real and say it how it is.",
