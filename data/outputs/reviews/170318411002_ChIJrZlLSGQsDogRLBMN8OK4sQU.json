Staff is extremely friendly and allowed me to take more photos of the restaurant, including the upstairs area with more seating. It really is pretty there. They attend often and refills water the moment they see it low. It's a nice experience.  Menu definitely felt looked like it could use more options, but it has enough non-spicy options in the first place. It's Sze Chuan food so you should expect to eat spicy.  Food had a good enough portion for the average person. I don't usually eat spicy food or at all. However, this place has small enough portions to not overwhelm you with spicy food.  I felt like the Mapo Tofu should be served in a circular dish/bowl with the rice. The square dishes make it a bit difficult to scoop up the food. The Spicy Garlic Pork with Rice was a tasty dish that isn't too spicy for people who can't eat spicy foods.  Definitely recommend the Spicy Garlic Pork with Rice. Wednesday Lunch was a low volume of people if you want to eat with less people around. Staff extremely friendly and welcoming. Definitely going to come more often",

I thought that the other car I went to before stopped parking and bought the parking ticket. I just managed to go in, just like everyone said, most The key is that the service is extremely poor. We ordered a piece of meat. It was actually cool, and the middle was still ice. It was obviously the hot end of the microwave oven in the finished dish. The meat \u54ce~ should be steamed. Taking the heat, my wife called the waiter twice, but my wife got angry and went straight in to find someone. The waiter was full of mouthfuls, and even eating and talking was unfavorable. I panicked and ran out. We just said The dish was cold. She said to go to the kitchen. Later, we waited for a long time to finish eating. They came up halfway, and we were anxious. It is reasonable to say that it should be replaced, isn't it? (Because we didn't touch the one that I had pinched before, I left it on another empty plate.) This time we called the boss and the manager directly. It is apologizing and sorry, but there is no point, then we have to say that We don't want to, let's go, this should be reasonable! Later, they said that you should not change it for you. If you are honest, you will be full of gas. You will not have any mood to eat. Later, the order will be more mad, and you will be charged 18% of the service fee directly on the list. Where is the face?) My wife called the boss directly, saying that you should give me a tip directly, we will give it, but you have just served this service, and it is that we are in a bad mood, and we will not give it. To give you so much, the boss asked the waiter to erase the tip, (we still think about giving less, we never have to give tips, we have 10%-20%), but this time we directly told her that we I don\u2019t give it, listen to me (because it makes us angry again, when we haven\u2019t said not to say less, the waiter starts to collect the tableware and give it to my wife, saying: You can\u2019t give Tips, but I want to tell you that we have no salary to take a tip, it has been repeated many times, but also a particularly stinky face and tableware jingle, she is mean that there is no credit and hard work, this time my wife Heart softly ask her that you Why do you directly give us an 18% tip?

We had a little water spill on our table and what I am about to say is no exaggeration and I had NEVER experience this anywhere, the whole time we where there that water was not cleaned, waitress came over and she saw the spill and literally had no idea what to do, she just brought a couple of thin napkins and tried to cleaned it with that and that\u2019s it, there was still water on our table but she didn\u2019t come back with a rag (which would have been logical in the first place).  Actually after our food came they never came back, we had to get up and hand them the credit card after we were done. They forgot our drinks too. They really need to step up and get better servers. I hope they realized the bad service really affects their tip and that certain people wouldn\u2019t be back because of service. I\u2019ll be back... for the food.",

Usually, my policy is to leave and never return if a closing time is announced to me as I enter an establishment. However, her tone was much better than a gaggle of waitresses in a greasy spoon in Indiana screaming the closing time at anyone who attempts to eat dinner any later than three hours prior to dinnertime. We gave the place a chance despite this ill warning. The service was hellish. Our food arrived quickly but there was no rice. We struggled to catch our server's eye as she would hurry past, averting her gaze. We finally flagged someone down, who informed us the rice was included and gave us rice still on her tray after serving another table (where I think she had taken five or six bowls left off by the same server). We consumed our food and spent half an hour trying to flag down our server to get our check and request boxes. We were grudgingly given containers, short one lid. The cold noodles and spring roll were ok. The mapo tofu was ok, as was the Chinese greens and mushroom dish. We would have ordered more drinks and dessert had we been acknowledged, but maybe they aren't in this to sell . . . food.  establishment needs to ask if bad service should continue to be it's hallmark given the number of establishments with stellar food and service within a block or two. Choose wisely, and let me know if you want to spoon up the spilled leftovers from my floorboard.",

We ordered appetizers first. Some arrived, some did not. Our server disappeared. We had to ask 3 times for the last 3 appetizers. They finally arrived and we then ordered main entrees. Our hot sour soup appeared to be a combination of 2 different soups and was served without bowls & spoons, otherwise the appetizers were all very good. The server appeared with the check after 20 minutes. We told her we had not received our entrees and she seemed confused. Our entrees arrived one by one. The food was very good. The service was very poor. We had really enjoyed this place before but now probably will not go back.",

One of Chinatown's little joys for me is that many places serve tea before a meal. We decided to share everything we ordered which honestly was such a fantastic idea and seems to be the way most Chinese people eat their meals. My friend had been there before so she suggested the Green Beans. These are so flavorful and seasoned well they don't taste like any green beans I have ever tasted. They were clearly roasted or grilled somehow which allowed them to be crunchy yet well cooked. My Bf who does not eat veggies even went to town on these and swore he would be back for more. We had the popcorn chicken that was crunchy yet peppery but not spicy with some green and red peppers with onion. Everything again was well seasoned and really addictive. The house fried rice was meh- wasnt bad wasnt good. They put too much egg in. The house fried noodles with beef was amazing and really had this savory yet kinda salty flavor i have been hankering for. The noodles were slightly chewy for a excellent mouth feel. We had the pork pot stickers- super juicy on the inside yet nice and plump  dumpling on the outside.  We will be back for more food and next time we will be bringing more people with us.  Pro's-Food is amazing, ambience and decor was spot on and all the food was delivered quickly.  Cons-Our waiter was unknowingly ignoring our part of the restaurant- he seemed either too busy or just in a daze. Either way this didnt ruin the experience and I would still come back just for the food. Parking is almost nonexistent but we found a spot.",

Our table of 3 ordered a lamb, a chicken, and a pork plate to share family style and we ended up with to-go containers for half of it. Every single dish we had was completely unique from the others and each was flawlessly delicious. I found myself picking favorites by the occasion rather than the food itself. Each was so good but so unique that I couldn't pick an outright favorite. Instead, I started inventing scenarios for each to get top billing. Can't wait to go back to try more.  Added bonus for the mounds of Chilis that came with the Chongqing Popcorn Chicken: took them home and started throwing them in everything we cooked. I'm obsessed with them now.",

They were delicious, even though two of them were spicy (ribs and mapo tofu) they were not too hot. The ribs were crispy and crunchy, with lots of flavors that makes you wonder.  Many layers of flavors that create a wonderful experience. highly recommendes if you like spicy food. the service was okay, they can improve being a little bit more welcoming.",

I asked him if it's written anywhere on the menu or have a sign that mentions this rule and the host just shrugged and looked at us blindly waiting for us to just leave him alone.

It had a sprinkling of lettuce and it was 95 cents more for a tiny dollap of Guacamole.  The Chips were burnt tasting....can you pleeeeze change the oil?  Burnt oil is toxic and bad to fry things in, I think it is best used for Bio-diesel. Doubt i will go back...to many other places to try!",

There's an upstairs too so this place must be huge, but on the main floor, the tables and chairs are so close to each other, you would have think this place was cramped. Guests were having difficulty leaving because chairs were in the way. And most importantly, the service here is absolutely horrible.  When we walked in, the hostess was talking to a table of guests like they were her friends. She saw us, lead us to our table, dropped the menu and walked back to her friends - without a single word to us. We waited for someone to come by to see how we were doing, or to offer us water, but no one came. Servers came to clean the tables around us, but they left us waiting even though we kept looking at them. Finally, we got up and left, which is a shame too because I would have loved to try a bunch of things on their menu. Unless they change their staff, I don't see this place sticking around for long and I might never get to try the food.",
