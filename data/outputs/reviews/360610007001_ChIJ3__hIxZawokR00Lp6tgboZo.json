As for the customer service, there is nothing to say, as it is non-existent, except for the one cashier lady, who is always extremely pleasant and courteous.

Iv been charged several different prices for the same sand-which, been imposed a credit card minimum one day and not the several next, to then walked up one day imposed again which led to a brief exchange of questioning with the register personnel so infuriating that I left my food there and just walked. Iv even had the owner come to me and say something while on line when I asked regarding it and basically got yelled at for asking why the pricing kept changing day after day. Told at the deli that they will give me what I asked for at the counter to then be told they can\u2019t make it or don\u2019t have the ingredients after waiting and most of the sand which is made. They never have what you are actually looking for and the food is sub par. I honestly have never despised  a place so much and look forward to never bringing my service there again because the service is so horrific and quite frankly tell all my coworkers to not visit this place because it\u2019s so shady and terrible. They need to seriously question their business practices and methods.",

The clip contained almost $1000 in cash, credit cards , my license and my medical ID. I returned to my son's apartment in the neighborhood and about an hour and a half later realized my money clip was not in my pocket. That empty, awful feeling set in as I retraced my steps and made a mental list of the calls I would have to make to cancel cards, etc.; not to mention kissing $1000 in cash goodbye. I knew the last place I had my clip out was Cafe Water and walked back there and approached the front counter. I explained that I may have dropped my clip in front of the store and asked if anyone had found it. The ladies at the counter asked my name and called for the manager. Within a few moments my heart rate returned to normal after they compared my license photo to the real thing and returned my money clip....fully intact! Thank you...Thank you..Thank you. It is very reassuring and rewarding to find those very honest and special people when the situation could have been nightmarish. You have made a friend and a customer forever. Thanks again and God Bless You. MT",

Additionally, I'm not sure why the sandwich guys feel the need to rudely rush you as if the place is on fire (even when there's no line).  On today's trip (my last), it was all too obvious that they could not have cared less about my food as they slopped the room temp, pre-made chicken parm (that had been sitting out for who knows how long) onto a sad, untoasted roll, pausing only to apply a cold slice of moz that would never melt.  What a disappointment.",

I really did not know how much selection they had. My vegetarian omelette was made perfectly. The bagel wasn't over-toasted. My god the cream cheese was so smooth and rich... I would go back just for that to be honest.  I returned at lunch time as they have a large salad bar stationed in the middle of the shop. Again, I was impressed by the selection! So much to choose from! They even have a sushi counter near the end of the store!  I have found my favorite new place to eat while in NYC :)",
