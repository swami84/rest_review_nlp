I noticed the lady in front gets agitated when she's on the phone or whenever the place gets busy especially for lunch.  My first order here was Hunan chicken which was ok, the chicken was tender & veggies were eh ok. I also tried their vegetable lo mein which was good (there's no way to mess that up & that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars). My friend got fried wings which she said it was alright wasn't crunchy at all. She also got calamari recently & as you can see by the picture it doesn't look pleasant plus it looks totally different from the menu picture, it's definitely frozen that they just put in oil & fry it. My other friend got shrimp curry and she said it was too sweet (too much sugar) and there were only 3 shrimps and a lot of onions & zucchini w/ white rice. I personally wouldn't come back here again.  PS. If your buying w/ your debit/credit card the minimum purchase is $10+ if your purchase is below cash only.",

They have a few tables to eat in but with no air-conditioning why anyone would want to on a hot summer day is beyond me.  The cooks wear street clothing and open toe shoes while cooking just covering with a apron and baseball caps on their heads. Very unprofessional and very unappealing.  I placed an order and even being the only one in the place it still to 15-20 minutes for my order to be ready. They said they \"broke\" the egg-roll and needed to redo. Maybe a can of soda to make up for the long wait? Nope.  The Chicken dish I ordered was ok with plenty of chicken but the vegetables were under cooked.  What was once a nice go to place for quick takeout has now fallen to the bottom of the list.  Updated: their delivery drivers use e-bikes on the sidewalks and run red lights in the neighborhood,  they are now down to one star until they educate their drivers on how to properly ride..",

My husband called in an order this evening, a simple one:  One order of steamed dumplings Sweet and sour chicken combo plate Szechuan beef combo plate One two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola  Simple, no? It would have been if the woman taking the order spoke simple English. The language skills would have also helped when she took the credit card information. How does one not understand English enough to take credit card info? Thinking that it was his British accent confusing things, he put me on the phone, but she didn't understand me either; I had to repeat it three times. She called back half an hour later, telling my husband in broken English that the card was expired. (It's several years away from expiry.) He asked for the manager, but was told that the manager wasn't in. He then offered to pay cash, but she didn't understand that either. He finally told her to cancel the order.  And that's when the delivery man showed up. He didn't understand English, either. So my husband had to deal with him AND the non-English-speaker at the restaurant. She finally processed the card correctly, and the delivery man was dealt with.  The kicker? They didn't send a completely correct order. The Szechuan beef showed up as chicken with peanuts. How the heck do you mix those up?  Order at your own peril, but make sure you speak fluent Chinese. As far as I'm concerned, they can jump off the Great Wall.",
