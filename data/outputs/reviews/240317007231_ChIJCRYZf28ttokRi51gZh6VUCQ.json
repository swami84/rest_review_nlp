The irony is that I order the SAME smoothie EVERY time. I use to visit few times a week. I don't know if it is training issue or understanding issue. I visit other locations sometimes and they get myvorder correct every time. Unfortunate that they are most conveniently located here in Gaithersburg, but they can't get my smoothie order correct. I just visited last week and today they got it wrong again. Thankful for COVID-19 pandemic it has allowed me to make my own fresh fruits and vegetables smoothies the way I like it. Now since everything is reopening I reluctantly visited but no more after this morning. Visit another location for better, more accurate orders.",

They are very friendly and helpful from the cashiers to cooks and cleaning staff. You can tell they genuinely care for their customers and their restaurant. This is the cleanest tropical smoothie I have been to. Some of the restaurants I have been to have a little bit of an odor from the supplement powders. This location didn\u2019t even smell compared to the other locations I\u2019ve been to. I got food and a smoothie, everything was on point and amazing!! Best Bahama mama I have ever had! I seriously wish other locations were as great as this one! They definitely have my business and I\u2019ve already encouraged several people to check them out!",

London greeted me tonight and his customer service is out of this world! Positive and kind and really takes the time to connect. I can\u2019t say enough good things! We will be faithful customers!

An outstanding leader , he was so on top of the game with customers and his team , like you would know that he\u2019s the leader (not the manager or the boss) the LEADER!!! The restaurant was spotless, music on point , atmosphere was so comfortable, great flow with customers, no bottle necks at all, everything was so smooth. Food was absolutely delicious and the smoothies the most refreshing healthy one I\u2019ve had. After coming from my sons soccer game , one of the coaches said let\u2019s go to eat at Tropical Smoothie Cafe and I was like \u201cBoy I want real food\u201d and surprisingly your food didn\u2019t just met my expectations on flavor but on calories since I always track what I eat and you were actually on my app menu \u201cin love\u201d I know this is a big review, I\u2019m happy you guys exist , this is what I call eating amazing food at an amazing place with amazing people !!!!
