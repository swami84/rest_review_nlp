The white dressing on the greens wasn't my style, but I don't like dressing in general. The place is cozy but bright and welcoming. I can't say the same for one member of the staff, unfortunately. We all have bad days, so hopefully it was a one-off. Regardless, I'll be back before leaving town and hope for a more welcoming cashier. In contrast, the staff member that brought my food out was very friendly and full of smiles. I was happy to see both locals and travelers in the cafe. If you don't want to eat inside, there's a nice park next door with benches and ample shade from trees.",

It arrived as a sandwich and I asked them to please change it because it wasn\u2019t what I had ordered and they made me pay  $1.5 to change it for a wrap (and I did even though I wasn\u2019t told before). It arrived again, this time as a wrap but without tofu. When I asked for the tofu she told me they changed the tofu for the tempeh. It was SO SALTY that I couldn\u2019t  finish it, They gave me a cake because of all the problems, and I\u2019ve never tried something worse. While trying the cake I started feeling so bad of my stomach and had to go straight home. I\u2019m now in bed after vomiting. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I would\u2019ve given 0 stars if I could.",

However, our order was messed up so many times that even the greatest food is not worth the frustration.  One time I got a tempeh dish instead of my delicious tempeh sandwich.   Not a big deal, I can live with that, the dish was still pretty good.   Another time we we were hoping for a quick lunch during work break.   The quick lunch turned into a half an hour wait for food.   When I finally inquired about the delay, they realized they forgot our order and gave us our food to go.   While in the car we found out that the order was messed up.   Also, their to go dishes seem to be smaller than the dishes served in the restaurant.  Another time we pre-ordered our food to avoid the wait.   We intended to eat in the restaurant, but we were given food packed to go, which completely ruined our dining experience.   Oh, did I mentioned that the to go portions were smaller than the normal dishes?  Our last visit was worst of them all.  We came to the restaurant with three hungry kids.  We were starving after a long hike.   Can you imagine waiting for food with hungry kids?   Let me tell, it wasn't pleasant.   The restaurant was not too busy, and our family of five took up the entire table right in the front of the cash register girl who took our order.   Not even once during our 45 min wait for our  food did she wonder what were we doing there.   I guess it is normal for a family of five to just sit in Peace Cafe taking up the entire huge table with just water on the front of them.  During the 45 min that we were waiting for our food, at least three Bite Squad delivery drivers came to pick up their food orders.   I realized that if we ordered our food through Bite Squad we would have gotten it.   So sad.  Two stars because the food normally is great.  This time we didn't get to eat at all.  We will not be risking coming back here again.",

Once I saw a customer with a bowl of Miso soup, filled with veggies, which I thought could be something light to enjoy if you're not too hungry. I ordered it at another visit.  To my disappointment, mine was just plain o' Miso soup!! First time I had the Yogini plate, I was so happy! Portions and taste was great. Ordered it on my next two visits, was totally disappointed. Never was the same. Very salty Black eye peas, the Kale tasted like it was the very last drop scrape together, strong coconut seasoned taste. The first Yogini plate I had everything was fresh!! Which had brought me back for more. Tried it twice after, never the same, portion and all. Then we joined the Vegetarian Society for 2017, Thanksgiving dinner there. Menu stated, Gluten free choice was Tempeh, but was served something else. Would have been professional if we were told Tempeh ran out. But looked like Tempeh wasn't on the menu. It was chaos with the Thanksgiving dinner. Sorry am not returning for any occasion again.",

They sussed out a place that makes the absolute best bread, and get it fresh every morning.

Parking is not the greatest, but there is always tons of street parking in the area. The interior is small but cozy! Dont expect to bring large parties here. The service is excellent! I asked them for their favorite dishes and ended up trying the Heart and Seoul, a vegan take on a Korean favorite, bibimbap. It was amazing. I got a mix of the tofu and TVP. The yuzu flavored carrots were amazing. The miso dressing on the greens was amazing. I also tried their Black  Sesame Kinako Latte. Highly recommend.",

Try and come a little early or a little late to beat the lunch rush. We arrived around 10:30 a.m. and easily found street parking in front of the restaurant. The pay meters are $0.25 for 20 minutes. At that time, the restaurant was nearly empty. We chose a quiet table in the back close to the restaurants mini Library.  Shortly after sitting down we were greeted by a friendly waitress who brought our menus and explain many things. I told her it was my first is it to her restaurant and only my second visit to a vegan restaurant so I needed some help in choosing things. She recommended the Popeye sandwich and the bibimbap for some variety. We also had their house made lemonade and iced tea and those two drinks were really amazing. You might need a little Agave to sweeten your Ice-T though.  To complete our meal we finished with a matcha Brownie and the hot coffee. The tab was about $35 plus tip. It's very good for the freshness and health that you are choosing. Definitely recommended.",

I was so happy to find an all vegan restaurant in Oahu. I ended up getting the poke bowl, which was made with tofu. OMG it was delicious! So much flavor! My daughter got the tofu terriyaki sandwich, which can also be made with tempeh. It was flavorful and my 6-year-old loved it! After we were stuffed from eating we still decided to order the homemade vanilla and chocolate ice cream. It was quite expensive for such a tiny scoop. Don't expect giant ice cream scoops. It was good but for the price but I probably wouldn't get it again. Overall, I can't wait to go back to this place and try other items in their menu.",
