Get a toaster oven. 2) If a customer chooses a baked good for inside dining, offer it to them on a plate... not a bag. 3) If you're not willing to add sweetener or milk to a coffee, leave room for it when the guests asks. 4) Don't give guests a number to be seated for coffee and then yell out \"iced coffee\" at the counter and expect the customer to fetch it. 5) Get WiFi.",

It's a convenient location being in the same building as all of my professor's offices. The staff was neither friendly nor unfriendly towards me, but they did seem very unhappy to be there. They were certainly ready to go home when I ordered my smoothy at 4pm.  I wonder if that is due to the quantity and volume of the country music that was playing. Typically most cafes have easy listening music playing at a reasonable volume, not this establishment. During the 30 minutes I was here the lineup consisted exclusively of country music being blasted at a level that would make a bar in southern Georgia proud. (Loud enough to hear through my headphones.)  Hopefully if you visit this location you're planning on a quick in and out. Otherwise you'll probably be as ready to leave as the employees by the time your coffee cools enough to drink.",
