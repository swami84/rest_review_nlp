This is one of those places where the owners took a risk and poured all of their savings into the business in the hope that their food would speak for itself and let me just say... it does.  Within 3 visits the owners recognized me. They're very kind people who want to nurture their customers with their skill.

I took myself out on a quiet dinner after a very bad day at work and just wanted some carbs. I went in with low expectations and was totally blown away. It's very much a casual place and was exactly what I was looking for.  I had the pasta speck and it was great! The noodles are all handmade and cooked perfectly. It even heated up well the next day. The portion was pretty large and could definitely feed two people if you had an appetizer or salad beforehand. I also tried their strawberry lemonade (made with sparkling water) and it was pretty good.  The night I was there, they were also giving out free dessert samples. I got a sample of the panna cotta with mixed berries. It was DELICIOUS! When I come back, I would definitely order it for desert.",
