Don't let that little bowl fool you: it holds a LOT of shrimp! and it is very good. That being said, they have this sauce my son received with his chicken tenders that made them out of this world. Without that sauce they're just good. With the sauce: amazing. The queso dip was very good, but the chips tasted like they came from a grocery store bag. Not inedible by any means, but also not freshly made in-house. At least, they didn't have that freshly made taste. It was a little disappointing. Also a tad disappointing, while still very tasty, was the size of our cheddar bay biscuits. Perhaps Red Lobster has spoiled us, but the bites we were served had us wanting more. Otherwise, our service was great and sitting outside on the patio to eat was near perfect. Would eat here again.",

Our server Seth was really nice and very helpful/patient with ordering. He has superb hospitality skills. Plus they have happy hour from 3-6PM with half off drinks and oysters:)  An Edit: went again today and the sandwiches were not very good. This is a seafood place so maybe stick to that because it\u2019s pretty fresh here. I had the ground meat sandwich but it was basically room temperature... The mulled wine however was awesome and the service yet again was excellent. I think our server was named Ian and he was really sweet and helpful.  Reminded again once we sat down how cute this place is... the bar would be an awesome place for a date!",

The only thing that I knew about the place was that it was owned by the same folks as the Pullman Diner. (Should have been enough)  Upon entry it was bright and some really neat old U of I and Iowa City pictures. Our server was knowledgeable and bubbly. The menu was varied yet not overwhelming. One of the first things we noticed was the teamwork between the entire staff. From the managing partner, to the hostess , servers and bartender. We were there for lunch so I went for the jugular and decided to judge the St. Burch Tavern by its burger, believe it or not one of the toughest things to do well. The Burch burger which consists  Iowa corn-fed angus beef, bacon, raclette & white cheddar cheese, grilled onion, black truffle aioli put this burger in my current top two burgers anywhere.  My wife had the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was also very good. One of the biggest surprises at St. Burch was that they serve Intelligentsia coffee.  I know it was a dreary rainy day when we were there but I think they may have just as well been called the french press cafe as french press after french press was brought to many of the tables around us. We can\u2019t wait to return to the St. Burch Tavern.",

The fish-fry inspired food and offerings of oysters/shrimp are all fantastic but I particularly love how they try to marry that east coasty seafood with midwestern-style american pub fare. Their takes on burgers, lobster rolls, mac and cheese are all top notch. Big recommend.  (Their other restaraunt, Pullmans, is still my all time fave, however!)",

It is a stone basement with a retro 70 vibe including old 70s beer lights/clocks and different sized punch bowl drinks.  They have local microbrewed beer to drink.  I had the tavern.  The meat was good, but there was too much bead for the amount of meat.  The bread was dry which kind of ruins the sandwich.  If the bread was steamed (perhaps just by putting the sandwich in tin foil) the sandwich would have tasted great.  The chips and onion dip was good as was the kale and bean soup.",

We sat at the bar in the basement, which was  probably a mistake on our part. It was a Saturday and the place was packed. A man walked up to us not 30 seconds after being seated telling us to be quiet because of an event in the other room. We hadn\u2019t even said anything, but I sort of shrugged it off and we stayed quiet.  I ordered a seafood tower that was met immediately by fruit flies. Not to mention the seafood tower was hardly a tower. Wasn't nearly enough to share with three people. That being said, the seafood was good.  I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere was great and the basement was cool. I will give it another try on a day not as hectic, but the fruit flies coupled with the food being underwhelming ruined the experience.",

Although I must say St. Burch Tavern doesn't need to be compared because it holds its own.  I came here for lunch with some family who was visiting from out of town and everyone enjoyed their own option of the $10 dollar lunch special which was 1/2 a sandwich and salad. I opted for the mushroom melt sandwich with roasted mushrooms and goat cheese which had great flavor. For my salad I went with the Caesar salad which had lemon zest which added some great fresh flavor. Also don't forget to order the curds (they are the best I've ever had) and checkout the bar downstairs for a drink and some bumper pool.",

The fish was fresh, the service was amazing, the atmosphere was new and fresh, definitely a step up from the previous restaurant at this location, and the drinks were out of this world fantastically made. It is honestly a rarity in Iowa City to find a bartender capable of making a proper cocktail and it was refreshing just to be able to experience one for once. However, on a sour note, the food was great but for the price and the portion sizes I thought it was nearing the point of not wanting to come back. Do not get me wrong I loved the food and our drinks, but after paying over 100$ for two people for 2 entrees and a pair of drinks each it was definitely on the pricy side given the amount of food you received. However please don't let this be the reason not to try it, I will be coming back, maybe not once a month but at least a few times a year",
