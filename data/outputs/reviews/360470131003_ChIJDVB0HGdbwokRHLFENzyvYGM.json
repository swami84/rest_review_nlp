My friend enjoyed her lion head meatball bowl which is not on the menu for some reason, but they had it. Also had the dumplings and soup but my friend said the soup had no flavor.

We got the pork soup dumpling and it was very flavorful and a good size dumpling and soup inside. Then there's the pan fried pork dumpling that had a unique seasoning sprinkled over on top that added this extra flavor negating needing the dipping sauce. We went back a 2nd time to try the crab/pork soup dumplings along with their shrimp/pork dumplings and they were also fabulous!  The rice bowls are much larger than we had expected and is more than enough to fill you up. The pork belly was soft and juicy, while the meat was slightly over cooked, but still chock full of flavor. Since they had just open I assume the beef will be better as they work out the kinks.  Popcorn chicken had a twinge of spice to give that little extra tasty tickle on your tongue. It could have used a sauce, but not necessary. Of all things, the unique looking black bao actually was the least of the favorite options. Felt like there was too much breading compared to the goods inside. All in all, this place is great and I'll definitely be going back to try more things!",
