Next time I will build my own salad which had a base price of 8.59 but with the chicken and a couple extra toppings, in will probably come out to around 13-15 with tax. Not s bad place.

DETAILS:  The staff was helpful, sweet, and attentive - the best any establishment could have. Their service alone is deserving of 5 stars.  The environment was light & airy, but definitely needs some soft music to make the space feel less empty.  The food wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t great (places like Sweetgreen are definitely better). With an abundance of choices, you can create a bowl to your liking. However, the portions for the protein options aren\u2019t worth the extra charge.  RESPONSE:  Thank you for your reply! I think there was some confusion regarding my comment on the portions. I was noting how the bowls are mostly comprised of greens due to how small the topping portions are (which isn\u2019t exaggerated by the larger bowl since there are no other toppings past what is visible in the photo).  I made the comparison to another establishment that charges slightly more ($11.59 at Time 4 Salad, $12.25-$13.95 at the other place) and provides larger topping portions to note how I\u2019d be happier to pay more to get more (not additional toppings, but larger portions of the toppings that are already included).",

The spirit of the staff and the place will make you feel like home.  Some may argue that the place is a bit expensive; trust me, you\u2019ll get exactly what you paid for. The plates that they use for serving are huge. Which means that you\u2019ll be getting lots of greens that can ultimately keep you full for an entire day.  I personally believe that their salads, unlike other places, are immensely nutritious. They use vegetables, fruits, cheese, meat, myriad seeds, and unbelievably tasty and unique dressing.

I\u2019ve been so disappointed in the salad options around here for so long that Time for Salad has been a God-sent! Fresh, tasty greens, plenty of topping options, friendly and accommodating staff-I can\u2019t wait to go back and try their warm bowls and pressed juices!  My only other feedback is I would recommend investing in some bowls for tossing-it would elevate the place to another level of greatness to have the option for customers to have their salads already tossed.  I will definitely be returning (regularly at that)!",

My appetite is such that I usually can't make a full meal out of a salad, but these are an exception. Nice to have a place close to my gym where I can grab some dinner afterwards that won't undo the work I just did. This place is just what the area needs and a welcome addition. Will go again for sure.",
