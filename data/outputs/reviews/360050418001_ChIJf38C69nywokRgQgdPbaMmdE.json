It took over an hour to deliver two items when I lived right down the street. The driver (Justin) drove in front of my house and called me when he was outside then when I'm at the door he said it was \"curbside\" having me walk to him to get my own pizza. I didn't know that there were three options to choose from whether it was carryout, DELIVERY, or like Justin says \"curbside\". His service was such a joke. Luckily for him people were sleeping in my house so I had to be quiet but if there wasn't  I would've made him do his actual job and deliver my pizza. Lazy is an understatement, the pizza was burnt and tasted horrible. I'm glad to see that literally everyone else that orders from them has similar experiences as me. I didn't mind Dominos before but now thanks to your delivery driver Justin I will no longer order from any Dominos location. I'd rather starve then give them a cent more of my money. I'm being very generous with giving one star, trust me if google let me put negatives stars I would.",

I ordered my pizza and waited almost an hour for it to arrive after it was out for delivery (mind you, I can walk there in like 7 minutes from my house) So after the hour wait from the time it left the store to the time it got to me, he calls me and  rudely tells me he's not getting out and I need to come get my pizza from him. I was looking out the window when he had called and didn't see anyone pull up...so He expects me to go outside at 8:30/8:40pm to go looking for him in the dark wherever he parked? He probably didn't even have my address correct. And since when did the drivers expect you to come to find them where they parked? Usually they deliver to you...so since I didn't pay up-front I told them to cancel my order...I'm ordering from them again (different location though) only because I have a free pizza...all my pictures of pizzas finally added up to a free pizza and I'm not gonna waste that, haha. I called corporate and they said they are supposed to deliver to my door, I'm not supposed to have to go find them. I've seen plenty of complaints about Christopher...It must be the same guy who worked at a location on Webster, because I saw a review about him honking and telling this woman to go to her. Haha Both of us cancelled our orders. I'm not about to get myself killed or hurt because I'm out looking for a delivery guy in the dark who parks in weird locations and refuses to leave his car. (there is plenty of parking there for him to park right in front of my house, soooo I have no idea where he went. Probably somewhere around the corner. Some people can't use GPS...or read addresses.",

I waited almost two hours for the pizza to no avail. I checked the tracker to see where the pizza was and it said (lady's name omitted) was double-checking your pizza. I attempted to call the store and was on hold for 10 minutes so I hung up the phone. I tried again, same thing. Tried a third time...same thing, except I stayed on the phone fearing I would never get in touch with these people. Finally, a lady gets on the phone and when I inquired about my food, she said the food would be delivered in a half hour. Half hour for crying out loud! We live less than 5 miles! If it wasn't for visiting NYC, I would've driven to the store and picked up my food. My advice for families who want to feed their families--those who deserve better--play it safe and order somewhere else, or you will endure the craziness I endured attempting to feed my daughter. This is my honest--unbaised review--simply based on customer prioritization and business practice experienced with this store.",

Well I ordered at 10am , and selected the order timing for 4:30pm and I receiced a courtesy call at 4pm from the pizzeria, and the lady arrived on time, very polite. She walked to the business and informed me she was going to bring more. I gave her a good tip, and the pizzas were amazing, we ordered 12 boxes but not one tasted bad. I realized that the reviews on google are reviews of only the customers that have had bad experiences. Also, for a few months already I've notived that Domino's has improved their pizza's and Papa John's which was my favorite, is so disgusting now.",

I called and the guy said it hasnt left the store as yet. I called several times and was given several DIFFERENT Excuses. Then I was told the delivery driver did not want to take my item now it is going on 3 hours. I am able to track my order online where it says LUIS Checked it at 10:29 a whole hour and a hlf later still nothing.I am calling and no answer, i call from another phone they answered so it is obvious is was on purpose.i asked to speak to an manager and got put on hold noone ever came to the line. Finally i got to speak to someone and explained it was unfair i waited 5 ours, my daughters now have went to bed waiting on the pizza which is unfair and i would like a refund. They stated ok then returned a call saying my delivery was outside.. which means it didnt take long to bring the food and they took forever for whatever reason. Now i am eating pizza that was ready since 10:29 which was stated on tracker and my kids went to bed without what they asked for!

My son and nieces ordered pizza online tonight. After more than an hour wait for the food, the driver calls or texts (I'm not even sure since they are communicating with my niece) that he is 3 minutes away. He pulls up and my niece is at the front door waiting for him. He says he is not coming up the steps. I stopped my niece from going to sidewalk. She had no coat on nor did she have on shoes. I went to the door (Note that this is a private house not an apartment bldg) and told the driver I'm not putting on a coat to come down the steps in order to spend my money with his company. The driver said it is company policy to not leave the car so he is not coming upstairs.  Mind you, this is not my first stint with dominoes and they have always delivered to my door. I could not help wondering if this had been a less Black neighborhood would I be encountering this right now? I stuck to my guns and the driver drove off WITH my order. I will NEVER order another dominoes anything and as long as I have social media I will speak out loud. This 'policy' is discriminatory. My dollars won't be on your balance sheet anymore, DOMINOES, and I'm working on my son, my nieces and their friends to understand why there is a need to boycott you.",
