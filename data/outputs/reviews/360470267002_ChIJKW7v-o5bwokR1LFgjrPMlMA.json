Staff is always incredibly nice, music is always the best, coffees are great, gourmet sandwiches and foods sublime. At first visit it might seem pricier than many other places but all you gotta do is stay put for 5 min take a look around, ask the folks there about what they have and you'll get it! They truly go the extra mile and really have a wonderful feel for their produce, their goods and last but least the neighborhood and it's customers. I love coming here and in this rare case willing to sacrifice a little extra I don't even have, just to have more of this in my Brooklyn life!",

On entry I was met by an awesome friendly staff as well as a smorgasbord of local snacks, stumptown coffee and menu of house-made sandwiches and salads. On the recommendation of one of the staff, I ordered a pork sandwich (al pastor with pickled pineapples and slaw on baguette) and goddamnit if that wasn't the best sandwich I've had all month.  Most excitingly, I noticed several coolers full of locally-sourced produce, meat and seasonal veggies from farms around the area. There were seasonal selections (ramps, fiddleheads, black radishes) along with onions, potatoes and local bread. It also appears that soon there will be another cooler containing seafood and fish. I'm currently planning a meal made from ingredients I'm going buy from there within the next couple days.  Excellent addition to the neighborhood. Friendly people, excellent selection and great food. I'm excited to say I'll be going back again.",
