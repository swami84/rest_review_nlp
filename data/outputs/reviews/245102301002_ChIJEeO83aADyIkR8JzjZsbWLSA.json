Our order came out to be 31 bucks for two regular orders of wings (Japanese BBQ and Lemon pepper) and one order of fries. They stated the wait would be twenty minutes, which is understandable due to the to go orders and regular patrons. We receive our food and headed home. The wings looked amazing but unfortunately tasted like nothing. The boxes were not labeled with which flavor the wings were and you would think by tasting you could determine which was which...no. Neither order had but a pinch of sauce so they both tasted like regular wings. There was only one cup of ranch for two orders of wings and the fries werent even hot. Most of the wings were fatty and very displeasing. Needless to say we should have spent an extra ten bucks and gone across the street to Mothers.  Eat here at your own risk. Definitely better places to order wings from in the FedHill area.",

The chicken was still crispy, and they gave us the sauces on the side so that it would stay crispy (we had our meal delivered). My boyfriends favorite part of the meal was his sandwich (the angry bird). The Buffalo sauce was really nice and vinegar-y and you could still taste the flavor of the sauce through the spice because it wasn\u2019t very spicy at all. I also really liked the katsu sandwich, but the shining star of the meal for me was the sauce. That sauce was tangy, sweet, and hit DIFFERENT. I also liked the Japanese pickles on the sandwich - they reminded me of the cucumber dish that is so popular at Din Tai Fung. We also got fries, which I think were a victim of delivery. I think if they were super fresh out of the fryer, they would\u2019ve been fantastic. The seasoning was great - we were trying to guess what the seasoning was but I have no idea (seasoned salt? Paprika? I don\u2019t know). We got the sweet Thai chili wings as well, which were tasty but I think did not live up to their full potential. The sauce on the wings was so great, but it didn\u2019t feel like the flavor went all the way to the bone. All in all, this place was really amazing and I\u2019m excited to try the rest of the menu!",
