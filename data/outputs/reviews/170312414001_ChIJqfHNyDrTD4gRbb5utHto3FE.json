I ordered with several extras like pepp, sausage, pineapple and extra cheese. Crust is super crunchy. If you like crunchy crusts this is crunchy. Would have liked a bit more tomato sauce.",

The cheese belongs on a charcuterie plate and not a pie.  It basically tastes like bread and toothpaste.  This place is a hard pass.",
