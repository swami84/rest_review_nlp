I ordered a few things but i have to say the flavors were a bit plain and not really tasteful. Plus the front desk guy is kinda rude in his approach and sarcasm. My honest advice for anyone craving vietnamese food. If you have time and alittle extra dollars. Go to flushing you will not be disappointed. If you just happen to crave viet food and your in Brooklyn, i guess you can come here.",

Their food is decent and their service isn't bad. Pricing-wise is reasonable too. I usually get the first pho on their menu... the special beef noodle soup(?). It comes with all the beef as well as the small pieces of tendon as well, which some other viet places don't include in their pho anymore... Their other noodles are good too. The regular vermicelli noodles with either grilled pork chop, spring roll or chicken all are pretty good as well. Overall, a good place to go to for some fast food. \ud83d\udc4d",

I ordered from here a couple of times before and first off the menu is not the same prices as you\u2019re charged for. They need to fix that because it confuses customers on what they want to buy. Second off their vegetables was not fresh. I ordered pho for take out and they put the vegetables in a plastic bag but they weren\u2019t fresh it was wiggly for example the bean sprouts were wiggly and not firm. And you can taste vegetables when something is not fresh I think they need to get fresher vegetables and don\u2019t mix all the vegetables in one bag and the sauces containers were in one bag too with the vegetables.",

I\u2019ve ordered from this place for a long time, usually once a week or so. Their food is pretty solid and they have always been great with their portions. Today I ordered 2 items. The food came super quick! I noticed 1 of the orders was incorrect. I called and pretty much they told me they couldn\u2019t exchange it even though they made a mistake. 5 minutes later they call back saying if I didn\u2019t mix the broth with the meat that they can exchange it. (They wanted meat we already had unpacked during COVID) They came in 5 minutes and as the guy hands me the chicken for the soup, he says \u201c $1.50 more\u201d. I thought he was kidding, he wasn\u2019t. They never stated on the phone i\u2019d have to pay extra for a mistake they made, otherwise I would\u2019ve told them to not come back.He kept arguing with me about it. I didn\u2019t have cash. He ended up taking the $1.50 worth of chicken back. In all my years I\u2019ve never experienced that before. I\u2019ve seen restaurants make mistakes, even replace whole orders, but they weren\u2019t willing to fix a mistake they made. $1.50 gained, customer lost.",

I love Pho but I decided to try their other dishes instead of my regular (#1 from menu).  I was not disappointed at all. I love their Beef cubes and Calamari is just spot on. The fried rice and bbq beef was just toooo good. Seasoned really well. Was definitely worth the money. If you want something light on the side, try their Calamari. Will continue to post more pics when I try their other dishes :)",

Both of the owners started in the Mamhattan Chinatown on Baxter St. They worked at some of the most famous Vietnamese restaurants there. I would eat there almost all the time with my Vietnamese friends who introduced me to the cuisine in my late teens. With that history and my taste for quality food, I can safely recommend this restaurant to you. The fare is traditional Viet, not the new fusion styles that are popping up, but everything they make is spot on. The meats are not cheap, fatty cuts, so I love that. I don't believe they over indulge in Make Something Great (MSG), rich is great. Who likes to feel dehydrated and sleepy after their meal? The owners came from an environment of providing food, not service, so be warned not to expect a super friendly experience, but on the plus side, you'll be able to focus on your meal. They don't do online ordering, but you can call and pay with your credit card. That's a bit inconvenient to me, but it also saves money. And yes, they do deliver. All in all, definitely worth going to to get your Viet fix in south Bensonhurst.",
