It was a HUGE scoop of chicken salad on top of a HUGE salad that didn't skimp on the raspberries, blueberries and pecans.  The chicken salad had a good flavor without it tasting like celery and mayonnaise. Mom had a cup of chili that she said had just the right bite of flavor without being too spicy while my husband enjoyed his buffalo chicken wrap with cole slaw. We got in just in time because the place really filled up by 1:00.  It's a nice place to stop in for a bite that's not too heavy while strolling around town.",

Lately both locations have been slipping in our book. 3 of us visited the Main St location on a beautiful sunny Saturday for lunch as our 25 year old son had never been there and we had told him that it was better than their Halcyon location. My wife ordered quiche and a salad, but the young lady at the register said they were out of her beloved creamy basil dressing... so she switched her order to a grouper fingers special featuring a basil tarter sauce only to find out when served that they were out of the tarter sauce too! My son's NET Jumble brunch came with a large but absolutely stone cold biscuit with potatoes in the dish that were not cooked through. My 1/2 roast beef sandwich with a cup of clam chowder was fine, the only saving grace of our orders. Why and how does a usually well run restaurant run out of house-made dressings and tarter sauce before lunch service is even over? And to serve cold biscuits and partially uncooked breakfast potatoes is completely out of order. I believe we will give them a few months to themselves before we return for a retry so hopefully these issues will be well ironed out!",

It cost 54 dollars. Nothing was bad, but nothing was exceptionally good either. The Corned Beef Reuben and Pastrami were basic sandwiches, nothing special. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes didn't taste at all like garlic - just simple mashed potatoes seasoned with salt. The mac and cheese was pasta shells in a watery, vaguely-creamy sauce with what tasted like crumbled Ritz crackers on top. Some of the Brussels sprouts were burnt. The restaurant itself was nice; it was clean and spacious but felt cozy. The service was good, and the employees were friendly. Again, nothing was necessarily bad. Everything was mediocre, the kind of food you could get at deli, pub, or sandwich shops, but extraordinarily expensive. A return is unlikely.",

The first time I went here for around a month or so ago. I ordered the shrimp po boy they had on special. When I ordered the sandwich the waitress asked me what kind of bread would I like on the sandwich. I was puzzled because traditionally on a French roll. They don't offer this. They have a barrage of breads but not that one. I got it on ciabatta. I thought to myself blasphemous, but I was hungry so what the hell. The flavor of the po boy was good in spite of the ciabatta. I got the pesto pasta salad as my side. It was ok but don't understand why they put these huge rectangular blocks of cheese in it. I think it is a little too much for the salad. All in all, it was an ok experience and thought maybe I should give it another try. I went again today and got a margarita to drink. Do not get the margarita. I repeat. Do not get the margarita. Ironically,  the po boy was on special again. I decided to get the roast beef au jus which in layman's terms is a French dip. I ordered it and the same decision with the bread came up. This annoyed me because if you are going to serve traditional sandwiches that many have had the same way consistently let's keep it traditional. The atmosphere is nice and the people are friendly. I think this place would be good if they got this aspects of their menu fixed.",

Second of all,  the vegetable plate did not include all of the vegetables listed in the description and some vegetables that were included were old and over cooked. Thirdly, the dish looked like slop to me. It was about four vegetables (two of them potatoes) all cooked together on a flat top (from what I could discern). The potatoes were burnt, greasy, and the rest of the mixture was just a dry lump of overcooked / old veggies. I could not eat it..Why don't they just offer a normal vegetable plate with a variety of vegetables individually cooked and take this concoction /slop off of the menu (looks like scraps from plates that need to be thrown out). Who knows..maybe that is what I was served (i.e. scraps).  I visited this restaurant several years back at their Mcginnis Ferry location. At the time, I had only a salad. At the time the salad was not bad...but then again it would take a complete idiot to mess up a salad...maybe I should have just gotten a salad....but what I was served look like scraps.
