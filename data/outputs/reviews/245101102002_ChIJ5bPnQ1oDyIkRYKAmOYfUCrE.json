I was expecting the sticky wings to have more flavor aside from the cilantro and green onions. It was still good. The apple bread pudding wasn't the best. It taste the best with apples, but the piece I had only seemed to have one apple. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because they gave me a certain time frame to pick up my food.

They put kids songs on the TV when my family walked in, we played board games while they made our food and the food was excellent.  Everything seemed handmade and fresh, my 5 year old said it was better than McDonlds, which is the standard of all good food (for him, clearly). I had their famous sticky wings, which were crispy and sweet, made with  some kind of savory honey sauce with a little spice. I cant recommend this place highly enough!",

I'm willing to give them another shot at a later visit. I did take them to go as I finished my burger and didnt have room for the rest. The atmosphere is welcoming. Cool spot for a quick lunch. I will say, their Red Velvet cake looked wonderful. I was being the good husband and didnt partake, but WHEN you do please enjoy it for me.",

The place is a local family owned restaurant, the bathroom is filled with amenities like free pads and tampons and lotion, hand sanitizer, air freshener. The staff were so friendly, the owners themselves approached us how we're doing. Patrons here were also friendly!  Now for the food. The food was as great as the place itself! My sister and I got Awesome Fries and the sticky wings! Omg it was soooo good! Awesome fries is a pretty big portion.  The sticky finger is sprinkled with cilantro and scallion, the flavor is just right. My sister is a big fan of wings and later told me she's still thinking about those wings!  Overall a great restaurant, food, atmosphere, staff, owners, patrons!",

JABRIL was a great help after I discovered my debit card was left at the parking garage; offered to treat me to some wings. I don't even eat sticky wings and from the time I bit into them, OMG finger licking delicious. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visting and living in the Baltimore area.",

I was in town for business and walked in here on a whim,and it was a good idea. I tried the \"Stickywings,\" they were hot, seasoned well,fresh,and DELICIOUS. My only regret about the wings,was that I didn't have more. The catfish and Macaroni were also good. To top it off,my server was delightful,and the Chef came to ask me how I wanted my food,and asked me again if we were still friends later after I ate it,lol,and after those wings,we were friends for life!! It is a quaint little spot,you should go,and you should eat there without a doubt!!!! If i'm in Baltimore again,I wil go back,until I do,go and eat there for me,it's worth it!!!!",

        "caption": "Went in on a Saturday night with two friends that were in town from Milwaukee. Since it was just the 3 of us we sat at the bar, this was a great idea and I'll come back to that. The food was amazing, just to be blunt. Two burgers were ordered, some sticky wings (get them) and oxtails. My one friend said \"i haven't had oxtail this good since my friends grandma back home made it for me\" My burger was....lets put it this way when I get great food, i stop talking. I went silent for like 15 minutes so I could enjoy the best burger I've had in 7 years. I ordered it medium well and it was juicy,  flavorful, just perfect. The best part was the owners were there and they are a family. It felt like they welcomed us into their home to dine with them.  To recap: Food \"better than your grandma makes\" level 5 stars Owners are nice and friendly and I'm so glad they chose Pigtown to open this place in.",

Ive been to this place twice and tried to give it a second chance since it had only opened, but i was disappointed again. The Turkey burger has no seasoning and was served luke warm, and the turkey kale soup was pretty luke warm as well. It tasted like milk and kale. No flavor at all! I also think the shredded lettuce served on the burger makes it look sloppy and not worth the$10/$11 I paid for when I could go to Abbey's for an amazing burger at the same price. I had the awesome fries which werent so awesome. The fries were soggy, the bbq pulled beef non existent and dry, and then cheese was poured over everything into one giant mess that really just made it all one glob. Lastly, the cupcakes are HORRENDOUS. If you like your hand to be covered in grease/butter, then I guess this is right up your alley but I was disappointed how heavy and greasy the cupcakes were despite how much the owner raved about it. Its weird they have so many \"healthy\" options but its all flavorless, and if I'm getting a Turkey Burger with a side salad, I would expect more than just a handful of mesculin greens without any cucumbers or tomatoes or onions for example.  The establishment has potential but they really need to taste their food, season it more, and make sure its HOT. The only consistent thing about this place is that the food is bad. Maybe their salvation is the wings, but I never tried it. I doubt Ill ever go back; at least not anytime soon. They definitely need to work out the kinks.",
