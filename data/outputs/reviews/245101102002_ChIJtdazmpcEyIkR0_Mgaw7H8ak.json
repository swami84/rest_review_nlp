On a Thursday night we were pretty surprised that there was nobody there but we sat down and ordered nonetheless. As lovers of Thai food we were very impressed. The service was very quick, food was clearly made to order as it was scaldingly hot when we received it. A couple weeks later, we visited again with family and though the restaurant was more crowded, the service was just as quick. Nice atmosphere as well, but you might miss it walking by, as it is wedged between two other restaurants. Absolutely worth a try!",

With room for only about a half dozen very close tables and an aisle, they spill out with a few sidewalk tables. The full seats and seemingly never ending carryout line attest to the great food. As vegetarians, we were pleased with the variety of entree options, and omnivores have an expansive range. Very reasonable prices. Don't drink too much, as if you need a restroom you will be directed to the restaurant next door. The slow though pleasant service (the second waitstaff had called out, we were told) and loud atmosphere brought the rating down from a 5 to a 4. I still recommend it!",

        "caption": "I really wanted to like this place, but I have never dealt with such unapologetically rude and unprofessional customer service. It's such a shame because the food is actually good.  A friend from out-of-town was visiting me on 2/14/19 and wanted to order an early dinner from Khun Nine Thai. Realizing that it might be crowded on Valentine's Day, I called the restaurant at 5:55pm, but it went straight to voicemail. Instead, we decided to place an order for pickup through Grub Hub. The app immediately confirmed my order at 6:08pm and claimed that the restaurant began preparing my food at 6:10pm and that the pickup ETA was between 6:30-6:40pm. After placing my order, I received a call from the restaurant at 6:11pm to let us know that our order would actually take 45-60 minutes. I agreed because I didn't know how to cancel my order on the app and was also willing to wait longer. I called to check on our order at 6:50pm, 7:06pm, and 7:07pm - the employee kept diverting questions about the food preparation.  Finally, he said that our food would be ready in 20 to 30 more minutes. Although we did not receive any additional notifications, we decided to go to the restaurant to see if our food was ready. When we arrived at 7:20pm, we inquired about the status of our order. The waiter told us that it would take 10 more minutes. At this point, we asked to speak with the manager. However, the waiter repeatedly denied our requests, saying that the manager was \"crazy\" and that he wouldn't want to speak with us. He also told us that he couldn't give us a more specific time for our pickup since he wasn't in charge of cooking. When we asked for restaurant credit to make up for wasting our time, he said that this wasn't possible. After repeatedly asking, he finally offered us a soda. Throughout our conversation, the waiter told us multiple times that we could also try to cancel our order on GrubHub. However, we explained to him that we couldn't find the cancel option on GrubHub and that we were willing to wait just a few more minutes since the food was supposedly being prepared. This conversation probably lasted 5 minutes and the waiter was unclear about a final pickup time, so we finally told him that we expected our food to be ready in 8-10 more minutes.  After a few minutes of waiting outside, we saw the waiter come outside with a package. When we made eye contact with him, he curtly said, \"Not for you!\" with an attitude. After looking around on the sidewalk, he started to walk back to the restaurant. We tried to get his attention again, but he claimed that our food wasn't ready and that we could cancel our order. We asked him if he could check on our order with the manager or cooking staff. As he walked back into the restaurant, he looked at us and said, \"I don't know how to talk to them. HMPH.\" I kid you not, he literally spitefully \"hmph!\"-ed at us!!  Based on the reactions of some people passing by, it was clear that his reaction and treatment toward us had been unprofessional, rude, and uncalled for. We felt so disrespected and humiliated by his treatment toward us that we decided to leave without our order. After 20 minutes, the restaurant called and hung up on me several times without saying anything.  After describing the situation to another friend, it occurred to us that the waiter might have been so unclear about our pickup time and so adamant about us cancelling our order because the restaurant had probably never started preparing our order in the first place. While I understand that it was Valentine's Day and that the place might have been busy and/or understaffed, if there was an issue, they should never have accepted my order in the first place. At the very least, they could have cancelled it from their end.  This was such an inconvenient and awful experience. For those who have had good experiences here, I am glad that you were able to enjoy your meals. However, I feel responsible for sharing my experience because I hope that no one else has to deal with this restaurant's ungracious customer service.",

Today I placed an order for pick up and was told it would be an hour and a half wait. When I arrived to pick up my food the server told me I had to pay in cash. While he was telling me this he was literally swiping a credit card for the guy in front of me in line. It was completely mind blowing. I didn't have cash, so I walked to my atm (with groceries in tow) and back. The guy still had an attitude about giving me my to-go order and was not apologetic at all about allowing some customers to pay with a card and not others. They can't keep up with the crowd and the food and service have seriously declined. There are tons of other mediocre Thai options in the city with wayyyy better service.",

I ordered the chicken but that was chewy and inedible and I ended up leaving it all to throw away. It probably got chewy while in transit because it was fried and the delivery took a while. I also ordered the massamun curry beef and wanted to add chicken so paid the extra $3. They said they can\u2019t add chicken because the beef was already mixed in. Whatever, but didn\u2019t refund me. When it arrived, there was one chunk of beef. \ud83d\ude44 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ordering from here again.",

He did not offer me a check. He did not put down a check. There were two tables beside me and the restaurant went silent. He did not exercise proper restaurant etiquette and quite frankly embarrassed me. As I went up to pay I told him that he was wrong and that I felt embarrassed and I had been there before and was not treated that way. He told me it was ,\u201dIn my head.\u201d And that I \u201cmade it up\u201d. The two tables were still there and I asked them if I did anything wrong. The people still eating said he was completely rude. It was embarrassing and made them feel uncomfortable. I asked the server/manager for his name he told me that he would not give me his name and to never come back.  **UPDATE** I checked my bank account and was charged $58 dollars for the soup. Again.

Portions are perfect. You wouldnt think you were getting enough but actually as you eat you tend to realize that any more than what you got would have been too much. The only con is the size of the restaurant.  Way too small. You literally walk in and if you took about 7 steps then you are in the kitchen. Thats probably why there's only one waiter. If you had 2 they would be running into each other. No bathroom either. So hopefully you dont have to go. I recommend trying it on a non busy day/hour. We went on a Tuesday around 130p.

The spicy eggplant had overcooked tofu and undercooked eggplant resulting in rubbery tofu and hard and crunchy eggplant. The pad kee mao was almost inedible. There was no flavor to it other than just spicy sauce, and we love spicy food. It was almost as if they forgot half the seasoning and just put in spicy sauce instead.

Every single time I needed to ask for something or order anything, I had to flag them down, when we were one of two parties in the restaurant. When our server arrived with our entrees, she but didn't have the training/sense to clear away our appetizer plates, so we had to lift up our own plates and sit them aside. We ordered Jasmine rice (+$2) and it didn't show up with our meals. After eating for 10 minutes and then wondering where our rice was, I asked about her it and she brought only one out of the two (forgetting one). When she brought the second one, I said \"I'm sorry but this isn't Jasmine,\" she said \"Yes, it is,\" but I'm sure it wasn't. The portions were small and the vegetables were all over cooked. Another waiter came by and asked \"Is everything okay?\" And I said \"Well, everything's okay, but...\" and he just walked away -- I was mid-sentence. Clearly he wasn't even listening. At the end of the meal, I felt a strong need to tell him (I assume he was the manager) about my experience. When I told him about the jasmine rice matter and how it was NOT jasmine rice, he said \"Oh, she doesn't speak English,\" as if that was a perfectly valid and acceptable thing. When I finished telling him everything, including the fact that he himself was rude, he just looked at me with an expressionless face, like he was a child being scolded-- and I was sooooo nice. His response was, \"I'm sorry.\" No coupon. No free dessert. Nothing.  The only good of this place is that it's cheap. The food is very, very average.",
