It was a true pleasure to dine during lunch hour with the entire restaurant to myself due to NYS Covid restrictions. There was no sacrifice in service as Raymundo performed with elite hospitality describing the menu & discussing the neighborhood. The plating is fantastic, portions are ample & the presentation was clean. The only downfall is the lack of liquor options but that's due to NYS halt to liquor licensing however they are pending review.",

Called the owner for a party of 30 for my annual gathering of friends.  I went in with an open mind and man did they make an impression. Kind hospitality, vintage ambiance as it was. A refreshed life in what was potentially gone, revived with the same menu and the food as if the original owners took off a few months to mentor their mentee, the new owners.  The food was \ud83d\udca3 dot com. Delicious. Fresh. And as Spanish as we can get it here in Brooklyn.  A great date spot. A great group dinner spot. A great experience for anyone who enjoys the vintage touch.  Thank you for a wonderful evening. #eatKomeeda",

Although I had not been here in over a decade, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was still serving great authentic food from Spain.  The half carafe of red sangria was quite generous in size and alcohol content. You could tell it was freshly made to order and came with perfectly sized sangria glasses. Appetizers were the Manchego cheese and Spanish ham platter, followed by the shrimp ajillo. Both were perfect temperature and a great start to the main course. The main course, Paella Valencia was delicious and packed with just the correct amount of chorizo, seafood, poultry and veggies.  Dinner was great in a lively and civil space. The waiters were quite busy however they maintained their composure and smiles. The only thing I would have like was that the bread brought to the table was quite cold. Other than that, all was as I remembered.  Looking forward to returning.",

A nice comfortable yet classy wooden look inside. You just walk in, look around, and enjoy what's around. Bar up front, seats back in. The kitchen is separated by glass, so everything they do is transparent. It's also fun to watch your food in the works.  Food is amazing. My favorite was the crispy . Super soft, well-braised, with a mix of clean and pickled side dishes that complement]. Their chicken is also amazing - and fresh. I believe it's straight from the farm. Comes with a mix of sauces that really enhances the flavor of the chicken. Grilled whole fish was amazing as well. Basically, with each of their meats, there's a mix of sauces and side dishes that really work well together. Last but not least, their tartar. Amazing and really nice presentation (it's their profile pic).  Service is great - super friendly. Went with people with our nonprofit, and they made sure we felt welcome. The owner even stopped by to introduce himself and share some info about the dishes.  Friends were a big fan of the basil and old fashion.  The bathroom is clean, so you can bet the kitchen is clean! Plus, you basically see the kitchen from where you eat so you know they're all about transparency.  I'll be back!",

We started with the potato croquettes and shrimp ajillo, which we quickly finished. For entrees, we split the chicken villeroy, crab and chicken ajillo which came with rice and fresh potato \"chips\". The chicken villeroy is outstanding but the chicken ajillo is really only yummy because of the delicious garlic and oil it's served with, the chicken is just a vehicle to eat the sauce. Desserts are a split between Spanish (like flan) and Italian (like tartufo) but the tartufo was yummy. The staff is attentive, almost TOO attentive, quickly filling your sangria glasses as soon as they are somewhat empty, but friendly. Overall, this place definitely is a good value restaurant with top-notch flavoring.",

Portions are smaller, and although the food is tasty, the current prices aren't warranted. With tables readily available when I visited, I was awkwardly still asked if I had a reservation. Afterwards, the waiter directed me and an associate to the back of the restaurant. I was left in a desolate corner. I requested one of the many available tables beside it, and I was told those tables were being saved for larger parties. Keep in mind these are the tables which I assume were for guests without reservations. The tables were the same size as mine, and no guests ever filled the tables. However, other guests without reservations were given preferred treatment. Never have I felt a sense of inequality at an establishment in this neighborhood. There's better service at two star restaraunts. After years of recommending this place to my family and friends, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",
