After reading about the the hype of Oyster Oyster, I'm glad I ventured out!  While the full-course meal is expensive at $38 for 1 and $65 for 2, the meaty and hearty dishes with a whimsical presentation and interesting texture is worth every penny! The dishes were bursting with flavor and playing mind games with my tastebuds trying to guess the eclectic blend of ingredients.  The stuffed squash with mushrooms and lentils was the most fun dish! I enjoyed opening up the squash and removing the lid to find layers of mushrooms intricately placed at the opening with lentils and grains tucked inside. While the dish was like a bland savory stew, it was quite healthy and the marvelous presentation was impressive!  The crispy green fritters with chopped nuts were divine and my favorite dish! I gobbled up the 3 bite size fritters.  The celery root with black garlic and buckwheat tasted like dense polenta.  i wasn't a big fan of the turnips with tangy spicy smoked eggplant.  The service is great and the food is freshly prepared for your order. When I arrived 2 hours ahead of my slot, the chef was still working on the stuffed squash! When I returned 1/2 hour later, my order was ready in a colorful personalized brown bag!  I thoroughly enjoyed the full course meal. While all the dishes weren't a homerun, it was a delightful experience! If you're looking for a foodie adventure, the world is your Oyster!",

After a long time in the works, Chef Rubba knocked it out of the park.  Vegetarian at its finest, with the neccesary flavors to back it up.  It is absolutely worth it! Currently offering take-away options, we opted for a sweet chilled red that paired very well with our meal.  Every course of our meal was incredible.  Update: 04 October 20 The addition of pizzas, bagels, and more. Oyster Oyster continues to hit the spot while serving up tasty wine/beer that I never would have come across on my own.",

My wife is a vegetarian, and it is exciting for her to have a whole menu that she can enjoy. I am definitely a carnivore, who believes everything is better with pork, but I can safely say that the meals were delicious and filling. They were such a great value. It's hard to find a place for take out where you can get a 4 course meal for roughly $30 a person. Everything on the menus were innovative and enjoyable, especially the ways he makes eggplant. I used to only enjoy eggplant breaded and fried, but every way Chef Rubba makes it seems to knock it out of the park. I loved everything about this place, and I am very excited to see how the menu continues to change and evolve as the seasons go on.",

Yesterday, six of us ordered the four course meal. Personally I think the food would\u2019ve been better in the restaurant. I wasn\u2019t sure what was supposed to be hot and what was supposed to be cold. The first course which was summer squash was quite interesting. I am newly into smokey dishes and I thought it was pretty good. However I think that the squash would\u2019ve been better hot. The next dish was some sort of heirloom tomato dish. I thought it was excellent and the gooseberries were a nice touch. The third course was \u201cpizza.\u201d The crust was excellent. I also adore chantrelle (Sp?) mushrooms and it was a great pizza topping. I only wish that the toppings were more spread out and that there was less plain crust. Lastly was the mushroom course. I am not a huge mushroom person but I\u2019ll eat them if they\u2019re in some thing else. For this course I knew I would not want to eat it, so I let my brother eat the whole thing. The rest of our friends ate the mushroom and they said it was disgusting. However the beans on the side were tasty, but they were cold and I felt like they should\u2019ve been hot and they would\u2019ve been better hot but the flavor was there.All in all, I thought the food was pretty good but it could\u2019ve been better and the temperatures could\u2019ve been better but I understand that this is affected by takeout in our current pandemic situation. My brother did not want to try this place again but everyone else was impressed for the most part besides the mushrooms. I\u2019m excited by the idea that the menu switches up every week, I think that\u2019s a good idea. Therefore I am willing to try this restaurant again in the future. Perhaps my ratings will increase based on future experiences.",
