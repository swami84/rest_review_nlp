Half an hour in after we sat down, I had to alert the waitress at the entrance that no server had come to our table to even provide us tap water or at the very least, say hello. Michael, who didn\u2019t even apologized, served us with a horrible attitude, extremely unorganized and uninterested in serving us and make sure we had a pleasant time. Is not the first time I\u2019ve been to Ainslie but it was my first time seating inside, the place is beautiful and the vibes are cozy which I love, but the service needs to be improved significantly. Otherwise is not worth the visit, there are plenty of other restaurants that main focus is to provide a better service and a server that is fully dedicated to provide the best hospitality",

Tender falloff the bone country style ribs, subtly seasoned Italian style.  Melt in your mouth meatballs in tomato sauce.  Can\u2019t emphasize how they have mastered that important balance between meat and bread crumbs that creates something so soft and delicious.   Perfect broccoli rabe, just a touch of bitterness but not too much.  Roasted potatoes, crispy.  Love the Italian riff on BBQ,  could eat this all day long without that greasy nasty over full feeling you get sometimes from American bbq.  Here\u2019s the wing in Gorgonzola. Plus, all of this traveled from Williamsburg to boerum hill (20+ minutes) really well.  Didn\u2019t skip a beat.  Bravo!",

Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t the most positive time in the beginning and the manager knows why BUT Jackie made it a wonderful experience overall and everyone in our party loved her service. thanks so much Jackie, this business is fortunate to have you!",

We were told several  times that 10 guests could be accommodated and because  of this information I booked  my bday dinner at this restaurant. It seemed  perfect  but we were brought  to a table that only sat 6 people  and the host and management continued to throw up every  bad covid excuse on why they couldn't  seat us. They kept insisting that we all sit down  because we were not distancing ourselves from the other guests at a different table . I kept explaining their wasnt anywhere for us to sit and were they expecting us to try to fit 8 people  at a table set for 6. They kept telling  us that they could add seats to the ends of the table but Clearly there was a break down in communication because  no one added a seat. I offered up suggestions  to split the table and was was told no ultimately 2 friends  walked out after being made to feel so unwelcome. Management switch  us to a table  for 10 and we sat and ate with empty seats where our friends could have been.",

The ambiance is so pretty. You can come here for a drink with the girls/guys but you can also come here for a date night. Food is amazing! We had the wings and burata for apps. Both wonderful! I had the burger- (the prosciutto is not cooked) it was so yummy and cooked perfectly. My husband had one of the pizzas- also great.  For drinks he had the ocean ave and I had a non-alcoholic cider!  Everything was perfect. Can't wait to return for brunch!",

This place offers a unique dining experience with mostly communal type seating which is great for large groups. Now who ever manned the door last Wednesday night needs never to do so ever again( two middle aged men).  My group of 8 stood outside for a good 5 min and no one offered assistance or acknowledged our presence. If you\u2019re thinking of dining here I recommend going family style and sharing. We ordered many different items from the menu and overall the food was ok. Most items which are labeled wood fired like the beets and wings do not evoke any Smokey or wood fired flavors. The Hanger steak was cooked well and rested but was ice cold when served to me. I\u2019m not a big Neapolitan pizza type of guy but I know a good pie when I taste one and the prosciutto/sage pie was disappointing and uneventful. The margarita pie was decent. Now they do have what seems to be a traditional Stefano Ferrara oven Which is a plus but the pies we had that night did not excite. No complaints on service at the table. Our server was attentive and energetic and the busboys were courteous and efficient.",

As we arrived the manager didn\u2019t even greet us and for some reason made us seat at a table that was not of our desire ( to close to other people). According to him that\u2019s was the only table available, mind you the restaurant was empty. As other guest arrived they were able to pick their table of choice, ok fine that was ODD. We order our food and drinks, to be fair their drinks were pretty good but the food was not at all. My steak was dry and chewy and my wife\u2019s pork was uncooked. To keep this short I will never go back to Ainslie, I regret picking this spot, the greeter or manager should be change, horrible way to make a first impression.",

Now coming to food , we ordered Meatballs , Burrata , and Margherita pizza. Everything was so good. Following the appetizers, we decided on Hanger Steak and Fusilli Bolognese. Both dishes came out on a timely manner. Steak was cooked to perfection. We decided to make the Fusilli to go , as we got so full. Portions are huge and definitely worth the price. There was still room for dessert, we went with Tiramisu. It was too good literally was gone in 4 spoonfuls.

Reservation at 9:30pm for 11 persons, our waiter with a gigantic smile says that he\u2019s going to take care of everything, confirms that everybody can have separate receipts and takes our drinks orders. The food was a fixed menu, pre-ordered days ago so it should go smoothly... Well, that it did not. All the food took sooooo long to come. We had to beg 4 times to have a refill for water; and our waiter was very annoyed when we asked for water again and where our food was because it took 30 minutes between salad and meal... But, because the tip is already included for large parties, no need to provide good service right? 11:45pm, still no entrees. 11:55pm, finally they arrived. Great midnight countdown with a chicken breast in my mouth. 12:05pm, free bubbly for countdown  arrives, yep, well after the countdown. I understand that on NYE, it\u2019s going to be busy - but all other tables had been served and finished their meals. The menu was pre-ordered and very simple; meaning there was no reason it shouldn\u2019t  have gone smoothly. Regarding the food, it was basic. The only positive aspect is the place itself that is very nice. And of course, we only had one receipt for the whole table. Thank you Ainslie, you\u2019ll never see me again and I hope that anyone reading this review will go somewhere else. Bye!",

Their prices are a bit high given you\u2019re supposed to order multiple dishes and share amongst your group but they\u2019re all fire. Specially,  their Margherita pizza is abnormally delicious for such a plain pizza. Service can sometimes be spotty but honestly, you\u2019ll get your food and forget all about it. Also, VIBES?! This place is gorgeous. Inside or outside - it\u2019s stunning.",

The staff is friendly.  The service is fast, but almost too fast!!!  When I go to a restaurant I want to enjoy the experience not just the food. My only other complaint happened at the end of our meal. Our waitperson handed me the bill and immediately took out the credit card reader. He hovered over me while I entered the tip and signed the check. They offer automatic tip selections, the first one listed is 25%. The last option is 20%.  I am all for tipping restaurant staff well, but when I have someone staring down at me I feel uncomfortable.  I also don't like feeling that I am being cheap for not tipping 25%.  And now the boring stuff: The front of the space is dedicated to a restaurant and bar serving simple Italian fare. The menu offers a small, very affordable, selection of pastas, pizzas and mains. There is an impressive appetizer list which is great if you are having a drink at the bar. The alcohol menu is large and very affordable. There is a beer garden in the back and a private event space upstairs.  Order recommendations: calamari, burata, Greek salad, margherita pizza, branzini, tiramisu, marscapone.",

Highlight is the backyard and the lounge area that I haven't get a chance to see yet. Also the beer selection.  Let's start with happy hour 5 to 7 and with some pretty good selection of pizza and $1 meat ball. Most importantly is their pizza and pasta. I think their pizza is among the best. With just enough sauce and cheese, we have no problem finish them one after another. Beer is a bit \"small\". I wish they get a bigger glass as I can easily finish 2 glasses.  Service is wonderful. The waiter can be a bit busy time to time but always check back after a few minutes. We missed our last happy hour call cause he didn't come back for a long time thou. If you want to take advantage, order or call the waiter down. I have a feeling you can order with any waiter but you get a \"main\" waiter for you table.  Ambiance is better on the picture. The place is spacious but with all the people and stuff running around, it turns out not as spacious as on the yelp photo. Tell the host that you want a table in the back and yet have I gone to the upstairs yet. I need to go back !! Bye.",

Staff was extremely friendly, especially the gentleman that served us food and drink (guy with a beard that flew out on Sunday) the food is really well prepared. Pizza and wings are the way to go. The decor very chill and I got nothing but good vibes. I will definitely be visiting again.",

The only issue I had was they ran out of every beer I asked for and instead of telling me what they have, I was left to guess what beer they did have on tap. Overall lots of potential and excited to see where they go.",

Try the salt and pepper ribs, wings, pizzas and orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe or the papardelle with pork ragu.  The space itself is gorgeous. The back patio is amazing. Wine selection is solid.   Great place.",
