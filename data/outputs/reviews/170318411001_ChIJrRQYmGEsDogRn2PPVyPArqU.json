Mr and my wife have been loyal patrons/customer since 2012 when their location was still on archer ave. We\u2019ve celebrated many occasions with Saint Alp with family and friends. We loved their food and especially their almond milk tea. After working all week for 10 or 16 hours at the dialysis clinic we thought we\u2019d visit saint alps for dinner. I told my wife let\u2019s go eat out and reward ourselves a little. But unfortunately this experience would be our last visit, when we got there it was like any other day, we ordered our food and drink assuming it\u2019ll be the same as always. But when they served the food we saw that the plates were dusty, it was so obvious that me and my wife were appalled by it. We were asking ourselves if did they really serve us this food with black dust in it? Are they serious? What is this? While we try to figure out if what to do we saw them like they don\u2019t care, that they\u2019re not paying attention, they\u2019re just on there phones and definitely does not want to check if they\u2019re being attentive to what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re standing on their station looking down on their phones.  We thought about telling them to replace the plates but were very discourage by their behavior. We were unsure if we tell them will they replace the food that had contact with this dark/black dust on the plates or will they just scrape it off to a new plate. The almond milk tea and regular milk tea didn\u2019t taste the same. It taste bland/watered down. We decided to just eat the top part of our food and left. We are not going back to Saint Alps. Our friends and family couldn\u2019t believe what we experienced that they decided not to go there anymore as well. I hope they fix this for future patrons/customers. Unfortunately for us we don\u2019t want to deal with that situation again.",

Even though this is in the heart of Chinatown let me reassure you that if nothing else the drink quality in this establishment is 2nd place to Joe yee  The legendary establishment for smoothie lovers, do not take that as an insult however that is one of the best compliments you can receive given the fact that this location is less then a 2 minute walk away from there.  Unlike most Chinese food restaurants which want to give you a more premium version of the traditional synthetic corporate food. They have decided to go with the more authentic take with ingredients and also items listed , It's almost a guarantee you will not find on the menu whatever is in a traditional take out Chinese location but instead you will find actual dishes that have an origin not in the humdrum attempt at trying to create a similar dish from a homeland which is What initially birth the rise in American South Chinese food but instead you will find Asian cuisine here.  Going here is like going to an authentic South American restaurant after eating Taco Bell your whole life.  You can in fact order something as cliche as shrimp fried rice however given their unique appetizers and regular menu and the meat selection being more than chicken cow and shrimp, I can honestly you would be doing yourself a disservice to not put some effort into expanding your palette.  But that's not the best thing about this place, Obviously given the name Tea House seems like almost a let down,  This place should be called KING OF TEA'S house in my opinion.  They have over 40 varieties of exotic drinks in almost every color under the rainbow not just brown and shades of yellow. Half of the ingredients and fruits which are not native to America so to describe the taste would almost be like trying to explain color to the blind.  And that is in no way shape or form me speaking hyperbolically,  Some of the drinks are even one color but transition to a different 1/2 way through the glass. And a serving amount is well over or just about 2 cups per drink. I don't know the health level or sugar levels if not some other form of sweetener they use but I feel like I'm glad they don't have alcohol in them because there'd be a lot more drunk people addicted to these drinks.  Super sweet drinks, tangy drinks,  Drinks that literally look like something you see at the other end of a telescope at night,  and Taro at the bottom of anything you can think of.  You will come for the exotic menu you will come back for the drinks over and over and over.",

The inside is cozy and clean and it seems like they have an upstairs area with more space. Staff are friendly and seems family owned.  They have a large menu with various types if dishes. We got the Hainan chicken rice and the eggplant and minced pork stonepot. The hainan rice was flavorful. The chicken was mediocre. It wasn't flavored and had bones unlike at some places we've had before.  The claypot was bomb though! We love eggplant and have had our fair share of this dish at various restaurants. The stonepot came piping hot and it did a great job of creating a perfect crunchy layer of rice at the bottom. This dish can often get too oily, but this was not the case here! SO happy we discovered this and will definitely be coming back for this again in the future!!!  They also validate parking. $2 for 3 hours. Win win!",

The teahouse has a minimalist decor style which comes off as a clean-cut - modern style in the restaurant. I started the meal off with the Chili Salt Seafood (Spicy) which comes with shrimp, imitation crab and squid in tempura as it had a deep fried shell around the seafood. A lemon mayo also accompanies the dish. They state the dish is spicy - however, I did not find it spicy on any level. From a 0 to 10 it is a two in my personal opinion. I have also gotten the vegetable dumplings which are served with a red vinegar sauce. The dumplings are delicious; however, I wish the dish was served with a different sauce. For my entree dish, I decided to choose the Beef Noodle in Spicy Soup - for my choice of noodle I went with U-don. It is my absolute favorite dish - it is slightly spicy but it is more of a broth, and the beef is always tender.  The tea rose that they offer is on another level honestly. It is sweet however it is not overpowering sweetness that you feel like five packets of sugar were added to the pot. (pssttt it also smells lovely).  The only reason I took one star away is that the service can sometimes be a little bit slow, but each time I have gone it has gotten better.  The reasonable prices, late-night hours, and a great menu selection make it easy to say that St. Alps Teahouse is my favorite place to visit while in Chinatown.",

It hurts me so dearly to have to take off a star, but the blatant racism is obvious here. Every time I have come here be it friends or family, we have always been served last. They hand us our menus and disappear for a while and the server contact is very minimal at best. Yet, other tables whom speak fluently in their language get full service right away and they get to order before us even if we sat down first. The first two times this happened we did not think much of it but now that it has been over ten times I can say it really is disappointing, but it won't stop me from coming here.",
