The pasta is superb, as is the seafood - others rave about the veal they've had - and the desserts to finish them off (get the chocolate mousse) are appropriately decadent. It's all bookended by a charming ambiance, complete with tile frescoes, Italian city-state flags, and photos of luminaries from politics (multiple presidents), film, and sports who've graced the place - not to mention a chef who never fails to come out to greet diners and ask how the meal has gone. This place doesn't get nearly enough love - it's absolutely worth a trip, or even takeout.",

To top it all off, the manager was yelling on the phone for the whole dining room to hear, pointing his cane while demanding servers and bussers to do various things, also did NOT have a mask on the entire time.

The chickens are tenderized through mallet-pounding so the chickens are very small amounts for the outrageously expensive price. Adding chicken to a meal is $9 (tiny 3 slices of chicken breast, it seemed small). No cocktails on the menu. My friend and I got sick 45 minutes after this place. My friend had the Chicken Alfredo and vomited, I only took one bite of my friend's meal, (it's possible it was the butter with the bread) and got only a little bit sick with trips to the bathroom but no vomiting. As for the positives: I liked the Italian decor and liked the Chicken Francesca sauce. I asked the restaurant to throw away whatever cream they used, but instead they were so kind and nice that they asked me to come back the next morning and try the cream again like a guinea pig. They said they would save me the Alfredo sauce cream to try again because of how confident they are that it is clean.  They stand by their product!",

Food was very good, especially the lighter veal dishes.  Gnocchi was excellent, but might have been improved with the substitution of a veal ragu vs. the bolognese which was offered.  Marinara was very subtle and finely done.  Tiramisu was heavenly - could easily have had a second piece!  A refined, and maybe preferred if you're feeling that way, alternative to Filomena's in the Georgetown area - we'll definitely be back!",

The sauces were made from scratch. The taste was good, but nothing spectacular. Service was a bit slow and the server kept trying to pressure me into getting additional food items I didn\u2019t want. What really made my first experience memorable was that the owner/chef personally came out to see how I liked my meal and insisted I try one of his favorite pastas on the house.",

After wandering around Georgetown and finding long waits at the higher rated Italian restaurants there, we literally stumbled across this restaurant just on the other side of the Creek. We were do glad we did. The host was so gracious about getting us a table. The place reminded us a wonderful neighborhood Italian restaurant... full of families, couples, and it based upon the staff interactions, filled with regulars. A great sign. Our server was a real treat...polite, smiling, helpful and always on top of making sure we had water & bread. As an appetizer, had the Mozerella Di Bufala Caprese for two... a huge piece of cheese on top of a crisp tomato slice...and they brought the oil and vinegar separately so we can drizzle to perection. For the entree, we had the Veal Marsala and Penne Con Vodka. I truly believe the Veal Marsala was the best I've ever had. The Penne Con Vodka sauce had roasted red pepper in it, which added a beautiful taste to a traditional version. The serving portion was perfect... we ate it all, and were perfectly satisfied. We loved this place...and will be back on future visits to DC for sure.",

My husband got the pesto pasta and I got the scallopini chicken limone which came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce on it. Now my husband is a picky eater and he lovedddd his dish and I am stilllllll wishing I had ordered a second played of mine just to bring it back to the hotel lol. My food was absolutely incredible and the marinara sauce was sooooo good that it was probably the best I\u2019ve had thus far!!  For dessert I had the chocolate gelato and omggggg so amazing. Incredibly rich in flavor and not heavy feeling. My husband got his favorite, the cannoli and he lovedddd it too and long with a cappuccino. Not one things we both had was not AMAZING!  This is an upscale restaurant and it\u2019s nice to see how people come appropriately dressed upon arrival. Reminds me of when I was a kid and my grandparents used to take my family or to dinner and we always got dressed up and everyone else there was dressed well too. Definitely not a t-shirt and jeans kind of place. So lovely!!  Not only that, the owner/chef came to shake our hands and great us. Most places don\u2019t do that anymore and should take notes. It\u2019s an incredibly nice thing to do as well as being proper and polite.  I wish this restaurant was near me at home in NY. Can\u2019t wait to visit DC again and to come back here for their wonderful food and ambiance!  Great food, great service, great everything!!!  Thank you again for a wonderful experience!",

Though it sits in an unassuming building just across from several embassies, one could easily walk right by with no concept that one of the best meals you will ever have in your entire life is behind the simple glass door of this establishment.  Genuinely amazing food, everything we ordered filled every sense we had with enjoyment and pleasure, the smell, the taste...astonishing.  I had a Chicken Parisian that simply melted in the mouth and had absolutely no flavor of anything that wasn't natural goodness.  In all of my years I can honestly say that the meal I had at Ristorante La Perla was one of the best meals of my life and one that I will no doubt repeat the next time I visit Washington DC.",

My wife had a seafood special that was fresh and delicious, I had the VITELLO MARSALA CON FUNGHI. The veal was fork tender with the marsala wine sauce and mushroom done to perfection.  This was not an inexpensive dinner, but it was worth every penny. We truly enjoyed our dining experience and will return soon.",

I am not sure if the gentleman is not familiar with U.S. Tipping etiquette or if he left what he felt the service merited. Our waiter followed us a block and a half to our car to tell us that the Manager was insisting for a 15% Tip. I had to translate for the gentleman who reached into his pocket and handed the waiter another bill. I don't know if it was the Manager or the waiter but I felt like we were being accosted. I have never had this experience and almost wonder what would have happened if the gentleman had not given the waiter another bill. Was he going to attack us? P.S. The food was less than average - Fish was dry and the pasta not very tasty. 8/11/16  I received a VM from the restaurant last week saying they had addressed the problem.  Then I read the owner's online response.   That is not what happened.   We did not ask for a Tax Exempt meal and that is not what the waiter said when he followed us to the car.  He specifically said his Manager was asking for a 15% tip.  So Sad!  8/15/16",

The restaurant itself is very classy and the location is amazing.  When you enter, you see certificates/awards and pictures of celebrities/ politicians that have eaten here.  The d\u00e9cor and atmosphere are both pretty nice.  The food is ok.  I have never walked out loving my meal.  First, the menu is HUGE!  It is a bit overwhelming.  I have tried a number of their pasta dishes.  Their pastas do not taste like they are made in house and never taste authentic.  Very ordinary.  Pasta dishes lack flavor and depth.  I don't have a better way to describe the food.  The service is strange. The staff always smile and greet you politely.  BUT they are very awkward most of the time.  First, You have to repeat what you say often for them to understand you.  Whether it be a question or you placing your order, you just have to repeat.  Maybe, it is my luck, but there is often a language barrier OR perhaps they are just not interested in what you have to say.  This could very well be the case, as there have been occasions where I have had to remind them of what I had asked for.  Multiple times.  Secondly, you feel like you are being stared at the whole time.  It is not a place where you feel comfortable sitting for hours.  I understand perhaps if they wanted to tend to their guests in a timely manner, and fulfill their requests without delay, but this is simple not the case here.  They are not attentive, and at the same time they stare.  You find yourself feeling like you are being looked at during the entire course of your meal.  It is just uncomfortable.  La Perla gives an image of Italian food at it's finest.  In my opinion, it is simply not.  Both food and service need attention.  I would also suggest specializing and eliminating items off the menu.  I would only recommend going here if you are in the area and want a nice place to sit and have your meal.  That is usually how I have ended up here.  They are local, so I wish them well and hope they pay serious attention to both their food and service.",

We were immediately greeted with a smile and escorted by the host to our table.  We were 15 minutes early but that didn't seem to matter!  Our server was Shahrokh and he was fantastic.  He explained the menu and answered all of our questions with ease. Chef Vittorio Testa himself came out and  talked to every table in the place, including ours ... such a friendly and warm gentleman.  The atmosphere is so peaceful and romantic here.  You can actually have a normal conversation without screaming across the table.  The food ... wow!  Everything we consumed had the perfect amount of flavor and presentation.  If you want to enjoy a quiet meal in a lovely atmosphere where the food is prepared with love,  make a reservation and plan to be pampered.",
