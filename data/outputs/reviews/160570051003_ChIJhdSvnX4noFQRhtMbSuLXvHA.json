Once our food arrived there was very little talking and a whole lot of enjoyment eating. The homemade ginger soda was delicious as was the double humble burger and fries. I loved the texture and crunchy edges of the burger along with the fresh hand crafted bun and all the incredibly flavorful ingredients..beautifully \u2705 done.

I can\u2019t even tell you what they\u2019re doing in that kitchen. I bought a jar of their sauce just so I can experience the flavor whenever I want.  Let\u2019s break it down: This is not everyone\u2019s favorite burger. The patty is thin and crispy. Not very juicy. But it brings a nice contrast to the soft bun. The pickles are crisp and sweet. Again, they bring a contrast to the savory beef and sauce. The sauce itself is also a little sweet. It has some smokiness, some acidic notes and also the creaminess you expect from a burger sauce. Don\u2019t forget to add cheese, because the original humble burger comes without.  I\u2019m wishing Humble Burger long term success. 5/5 stars.",

The rest of the evaluation is mostly a critique of the burger itself. The environment is very stylish and nice and the staff/ownership are very friendly and kind. Like I said, I want them to be great. Sadly, the food is just lacking.  1. The burgers are a decent portion and the meat is fresh but unfortunately the meat is also flavorless. They depend entirely on the toppings for flavoring the sandwich.  2. There's too much bread. The buns are too dense and it makes it all very dry. It's hard to enjoy the sandwich.  3. The prices are too high. To get fries, burger and drink you are looking at $10+. That's a bit steep for not getting a truly fantastic burger. Especially one that has lousy American cheese rather than a nice slice of medium cheddar.  4. The fries are fine but not spectacular. They are usually a bit overdone.  5. The frustrating thing is that the burgers were better when they started out at the farmer's market.  They have a nice little location but the food is just no longer worth the price.  Are you going to be mad if you eat here? Probably not. But will you feel like you could have spent that $10 on something better elsewhere? I would say so.",

The flattened burger was burned on the outer brim (WAY more than usual, and you could just smell the burning smell before I even opened the bag.  The bun they use now seems like it came from WINCO.

The ranch dressing was really good as was the fry sauce. The burger was good too. The lemonade was strong but good. The only problem was that the drink was to small.",

I try to eat beef only once a week and this is what I end up choosing for that weekly beef meal 9 times out of 10. They make the burgers in front of you right after you order them (smash patty style) and their sauce is something I've literally had dreams about. They know it's good and have recently started selling their sauce by the jar. I can always count on friendly conversation with the employees anytime I go in there and good music. Also, if you frequent the establishment they make an effort to remember you although that doesn't change the service because it can't get any better than it is. For the people my age who will understand this, it's the closet you will ever come in life to eating a Krabby Patty. If you've never eaten here before you need to change that!",

I could see how some fancy people would enjoy it, but I didn't as much. Next time I will get their house made soda instead. The place is on the expensive side with two combo meals, one with a shake, totaling $27.43. The environment is busy, and the place is small, add to the hustle and bustle.

Upon parking, discovered we were right in front of the actual restaurant! Went in, placed our order and retreated to the outside tables. We were second in a line of two....but within a few minutes, the place was jammed out the far door. It was one of the best burgers we have enjoyed in quite awhile, big...juicy...caramelized on both sides but still moist in the middle.  Just like you would fix one at home in the cast iron skillet.

The fries are nice and thin which makes them crunchy. You can get any burger without the bun if you don't want the carbs or gluten.  The people are very nice and helpful. They were very accommodating for some of our special requests, and were about to help with some of the special requests.  The place is not large, but the place is nice for a burger.",

I am sure the food is still delicious and the customer service was always great, but I can't support such hateful ideology.
