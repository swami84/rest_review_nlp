We were offered a coupon for a free pizza that we don't even plan to redeem. Tonight it took well over an hour to deliver an order that was supposed to be done in 29-39 minutes. I understand maybe the online system estimates incorrectly, but they need to either fix it or apologize without equivocating when they are late. We are done with this place.  Update: Winter 2019, I will upgrade them to three stars. We ordered from them recently out of necessity and had a good experience. We have gotten delivery maybe twice since then with only a couple minor issues (being late once and forgetting the sauce once).  Much better than before.",

It's gotten better, but the attitude and result of Papa Johns hasn't changed much. When I called last night the second time of the new rogue driver who sped down my quiet street for the SECOND time at over 40 miles per hour, the manager did not have his supervisor call me as I asked him to, and told me to call the police if I wanted to. The police will be looking into the matter, and also told me to put the word out to call the police if a Papa Johns car is going .25 mph over the limit, is not paying attention to the road or doing anything unsafe. I don't know why they get a minimum of one star.  Quality, taste, customer service, seem like they're the buzz words they are worried about.  I guess they'll start stressing safety when they run over somebody.",
