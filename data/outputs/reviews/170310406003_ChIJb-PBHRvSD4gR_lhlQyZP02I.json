The special at this German restaurant was Taco Tuesday & margaritas. This should've been my first clue to leave. Ww ordered drinks which neither of us liked and sent back. The menu had no rhyme or reason. The appetizers were scattered throughout the menu. The menu can't determine if this is a German, Italian or wanna be mexican restaurant. We ordered the wiener schnitzel. Which was ok. The spaetzle was crunchy which I've never had like that before. The sauerkraut and or red cabbage are served on the plate not in a bowl to contain the juices so if u dont like ur food touching don't order it. Mom ordered the chicken marsala which was so dry it had the texture of liver. All in all it was a major disappointment. I'm a lobg time client of the Chicago Brauhaus and before that the Heidelberg Fass, two truly excellent authentic Geeman restaurants. I have traveled all over Germany and Austria and know a good German meal when I see and taste it This fell extremely short sorry to say.",

My only complaints are that the fried calamari legs were chewy and the beer selection was terrible. For a German restaurant to not have an array of German beer is baffling! How can they not have hefeweizen?! Witbier? With an upgrade in beer I'd give it 5 stars.",

I then asked if the pizza had been sitting there for an hour and a half. They were happy to take my credit card. It would be nice to get dinner...still waiting...",

However, based upon my first (and last) visit I can only recommend this establishment for its cozy environment and nothing more.  It's a restaurant in search of a cuisine that's on the pricey side too!  Which are you Himmel, German or Italian?  The Owner's need to decide what they're trying to present.  I didn't have any Italian food but the German offerings were slim and lacked some major traditional items.  The Sauerbraten was mediocre at best.  Pass this one up. There are plenty of other good German restaurants in Chicago with authentic fare including the big dining room downtown!",

Grilled vegetable antipasto is phenomenal - with very delicate balsamic vinegar reduction. I have not sampled their German dishes. The inside of restaurant and the decor is OK. It does get very noisy on Saturdays (very busy). You see lots of locals and families with kids here. Overall, I like the place because the food I've tasted here is good.",
