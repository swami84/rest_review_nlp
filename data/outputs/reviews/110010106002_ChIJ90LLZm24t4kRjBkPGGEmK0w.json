They said the driver was just arriving and was about to ring us, followed by promptly hanging up the phone. We waited another 20 minutes before attempting to ring up again. This time we couldn\u2019t get through to anyone. After a lovely 2 and a half hours we finally get a phone call saying they are outside. We head down and speak to the driver but before paying we checked the temperature of the pizza. Probably wasn\u2019t necessary as when we opened the box it looked how the pizza looks the morning after it\u2019s been sat in the fridge. Safe to say when we did touch it it was cold. We said we weren\u2019t accepting the pizza, sent it back and ordered food from somewhere else. Weirdly, the driver asked us to phone the store and say it was busy, not sure what he was referring to but probably something shady going on.

FOUR employees were standing near the registers/counter having a personal conversation. three appeared to be delivery persons, but the fourth had on a regular uniform. not one of them greeted or acknowledged me. even if they couldn't ring orders they could've given me my order. furthermore, if they weren't working the front of the store, or at all, they shouldn't have been where they were. i've been to this location 3 times in the last 5 months and every time it's been a horrible customer service experience. once, we waited 20 minutes for an order that was supposed to take 10-15 minutes, checked on it and were told it was almost ready. waited another 10 minutes only to learn that it hadn't even been started... the store wasn't busy,  you just had horrible staff including the manager on duty who took no ownership of the error. your employees need training on proper customer service, as well as A to Z front of the house training. do better.",

Right after delivery, upon tasting the pizza, I immediately called the driver, who casually instructed me to call the store.  He even acknowledged giving me the wrong order.  I wondered, \u201cwhy not call me as soon as he found the issue?  Did he think I would just \u201cbe ok\u201d with the wrong stuff?  Maybe I wouldn\u2019t notice?\u201d  Per his instruction, i called the store to let them know about the error.  The store told me to keep the wrong order and they would still send out the correct order.  After waiting patiently for a replacement the driver finally called to announce his pending arrival.  He seemed to not want to get out of the car (am I supposed to walk out to you?) then VERY SURLY REQUESTED TO GET THE PIZZA BACK that was delivered in error.  According to him, why should I be able to keep both pizzas?  Totally unprofessional and a bait and switch from the information I received from the store.  I called the restaurant AGAIN (mainly because I wanted the original credit card tip taken off the receipt). They offered a measly $10 credit off my next order-a lame move that protects this man\u2019s undeserved cash.  NOW IM FORCED TO TIP THE GUY WHO TREATED ME LIKE SH*t, even referring to me as a \u201cbig man\u201d, which I loathe even if it is meant in jest-because it\u2019s never really \u201cin jest\u201d. Not to mention, the \u201ccorrect\u201d pizza tasted much worse then the original one delivered.  Like they took THEIR mistake out on MY pizza\u2019s quality.  If my actual order had tasted as good as the \u201cmistake\u201d, I could have AT LEAST given another star.   Domino\u2019s, what the hell happened here?!?!  UPDATE:  I contacted Dominos at the email address they gave below and guess what, no response...are u surprised?  I\u2019m not!!!",

I had to do a double take, it was made and presented so well I questioned where I was. They didn\u2019t skimp on ingredients (ham, pepperoni, and pineapple). Not too much cheese, and also not too much nor too little sauce.  Taste: It was surprisingly well above average. Is it on par with We the Pizza? No. Then again this large only cost $8 vs $22+. For the price it is excellent.  I\u2019ve had freshly made pies at other places and somehow the pizza was just warm. Not this one ... so hot I had to wait a few minutes.

I was told to bring back the order and would receive a new one. I walked back to the store and showed the manager the hair on both pizzas. He laughed, walked away and joked about it with the guy making the food. I asked for his name and to talk to him but he would not come back and address the issue. The guy making the food got upset that I wanted a replacement order and started arguing with me. Staff was disrespectful, incompetent, combative, and never issued an apology. Terrible experience and will not be returning to this location.",

Yesterday, we had a meeting at my place of employment and decided to order pizza from Domino's as we've done in the past. When the driver arrived at the business he called my cell phone but because I was at work assisting customers was unable to answer at that time. When I called him back his response was \"Ma'am I am on my way back to the store and you will have to have someone else make your delivery because I get off at 5pm\" When I asked him why didn't he come inside to make the delivery his response was \"Ma'am I'm NOT leaving my car to come inside to drop these pizzas off\" This was shocking to me how rude and unprofessional this employee was especially since he was delivering to a business of professionals who have ordered from this Domino's before. In the past when we placed orders to be delivered the driver always came Inside to drop the pizzas off with no problem. I will NEVER and repeat NEVER order from this location again and maybe even never from Domino's. I work in customer service for a living and would never speak to a customer especially one who is supporting your business in the matter. When I spoke with management at this location she did not assist with resolving this matter which is why I will not patron here again and have also communicated this situation with my company so that Domino's will not be a choice to order from in the future.",

I get off work at 5 pm and we decide that rather than cooking, it would be nice to order something.  Around 6 pm, we place our order with the same Domino's we always order from, which has always given us reliable service and is very fast. We order a single medium pizza and two salads. The wait time was 50-60 minutes.  6:45 pm, we check and the pizza has been out of the oven for about 15 minutes, but hasn't been delivered.  7:15 pm, we call the store to see what's up with our order. They tell us it just left the store. We're not super happy because that means it's been sitting for 45 minutes getting cold before even leaving the store.  8 pm, still no pizza. We call the store again. The woman can't find our order. Luckily, as I'm on the phone with her, the delivery driver calls. Our building doesn't let delivery drivers up to apartments, so my fianc\u00e9 goes down to get the order and express our disappointment that it is 2 hours late. The delivery driver hands him a pizza. No salads. Receipt clearly says we ordered salads. She says she's so sorry, that she'll go back and get them.  8:30 pm, here we are, still no salads, with a cold pizza. I'm convinced she is not coming back.  Thanks Domino's, for turning what should have been a relaxed evening into us eating late and being angry.  Also, I've seen the replies from who I'm assuming is the owner offering $10 off coupons or free pizzas and desserts or something. Save it. We'll never be ordering from here again. This is ridiculous. The only reason you even got two stars is because we've gotten great service over the past year when we were ordering a lot due to being in law school and studying for the bar exam. So honestly I really liked this store, and was a very consistent customer. Byeeeee.",

I request that the delivery be cancelled and my money refunded. Store worker obliges and apologizes profusely.  Receive a call from the deliver driver. Driver says they're taking the pizza back because they called 25 minutes ago and didn't reach anyone. Uh, no. Phone in hand and no call. Driver is irate so I let them finish and the call ends.  It's now 5:25pm and I'm disappointed, mad, and without a pizza. Thank you Dominoes. You won.  In short, the negative reviews of this store (individual franchise) are accurate.

I called at 8 pm and the guy said there would be a two and a half hour wait for delivery and I sad that's fine because I am at work. The guy said rudely \"do you understand what that means?\" I said yes it means that it'll take you two and a half hours to get here. So after almost 3 hours I called to check the status and was informed that there no order placed for me despite giving my card number and etc. The guy said  when the app is down they can't take credit card payment but the employees don't know this so they take your order and card number and just have you waiting for nothing says the manager. So I placed the order a second time as they said the wait was next to nothing at this point. An hour later I called to check and they answered the phone \"\" dominos! We''e closed\" i told him that already ordered and gave my information anf he said \"oh we are about to send a driver to you now.\" 30 minutes later I got a text saying the driver was on the way. An hour after someone called saying they were outside. So over 4 hours later they deliver burnt chicken without sauce and the wrong drink and the guy says they're short on drivers. I'm honestly surprised they came. I used them a time before and they cancelled the order without calling and closed up. I had to speak with someone the next day. So based on that rapport. I ordered from NY Pizza who came in 30 minutes or less. Save yourself the headache and the time. Service and food quality is poor. They burned my chicken in and it looks like they scrapped the grill and put that in the box too. Smh",

I don't care if you're backlogged--that's your problem, not mine.  Hey, Dominos: HIRE MORE DRIVERS.  I paid for dinner, not a midnight snack.  If you have a delivery delay, then TELL ME WHEN I ORDER.  Though I understand why you wouldn't disclose this--you already have my credit card info and can charge me, so why do you care?  Seems like fraud to me.  Maybe the Better Business Bureau should get involved.  It would have been faster to just walk over and pick the pizza up.  Or, even better, to ORDER FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.  Also, teach your employees how to be even *basically* empathetic to customers.  Not that difficult.  Anyone who want pizza: do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else.",

Online tracker said driver left at 12:08 a.m. Driver did not arrive until 12:55 a.m. I called local number and got an immediate answer at 12:40 a.m., claiming the online tracker was incorrect and that the driver had left only 10 minutes prior.  Unlike other reviews, I did get my food and the driver did call (although just said \"this is Dominoes\", I had to ask if he was outside and/or wanted me to come down).  The food was moderately warm and still tasty.  For at least answering the phone and calling when they arrived, this Domino's earns 3 stars.  However, customers should BEWARE THE LONG WAIT.  Next time I'll order online from a local place and try to order earlier in the night.",

Thanks and by the way it was absolutely delicious as I have come to expect from you!**  Both Dominos the chain and this particular branch have got a lot better recently. This branch seem to have had challenges keeping a strong staff in place but may finally have gotten their stuff together on the day shift at least.  I have experienced in the past the awful service people describe below so now I try to avoid ordering at peak times; before noon or after 2pm my lunch order usually takes about 30mins to get to me in Capitol Hill. I always order online.  I have ordered their Gluten Free pizza repeatedly for lunch - kudos to Dominos for getting in on the GF scene - and find it quite delicious and just the right size for one. I am \"docking\" them one star because on one occasion the GF pizza was a little overcooked which basically turns the base to tasteless, brittle cardboard.",

Ralph parked out front and demanded a DeafBlind man to come to his car to get our pizza and sign my receipt. But it's my credit card under my name, so you guys needed my signature. I understand if Ralph wants to avoid the rain, but we are the paying customers. Not only that, our order left the store location at 6:49 pm and now it is 7:45 pm. The pizzas are both a little cold. I have been pretty good being faithful at tipping 4 or 5 dollars for 20 to 25 dollar orders, but I am not paying tip this time because of the driver's lack of compassion, lateness and making the experience tonight totally unnecessary.",

It looks like they just threw the ingredients on the pizza then tossed it in the oven. I ordered a pepperoni lovers,which from any other Domino's the pepperoni is so close together you can't even see the cheese underneath. From here their version was about 10-12 pep pieces OVER THE ENTIRE PIZZA, burnt, so upset. I'm not one to complain IMMEDIATELY but this is what I get everytime I order.",

        "caption": "I'm usually a big fan of Dominos because it's fairly decent pizza at usually great prices and fast delivery. I'd say my roommates and I order pizza once a week from Dominos. We just moved to our current address in DC about 4 months ago. Our first Dominos delivery experience with this location was decent - we placed an order online, realized after the fact that we needed a 2 liter soda, called in to order it, and the driver gave it to us for free. The parmesan breadbites were extra buttery, and the pizza was hot and fresh. However, all subsequent 10+ Dominos experiences have been horrible. Every single pizza, breadstick, etc. has been overcooked/burned. My pizzas take over an hour to reach me even if the quoted delivery time is 25-30 minutes, and often times, the tracker says \"Delivered\" 25-30 minutes before it even reaches me. Half of the time, the drivers tell me they're outside, only to discover they went to the wrong address (and then take an additional 15 minutes to get to me). One driver didn't want to leave his car in the rain, so he called in advance, said he would be at my place in exactly 7 minutes, and told me to stand outside on the curb in 7 minutes in the rain to get the pizza from him when he drove it. Of course he showed up 15 minutes later and was upset to see me in my doorway and not on the curb. Another driver was very creepy and would not stop hitting on me. I put up with the burned pizza and super slow service for a while because it seemed like such a great deal. However, I found out today when I tried to call in an order that it's no longer $11.10 for two medium two toppings but rather $16.99 now. Now that it's not longer a great deal, I will be sticking to local pizza joints.",
