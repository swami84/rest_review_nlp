I came all the way to Brooklyn from Eastern Connecticut to try them and they didn't disappoint. Everyone was friendly and extremely helpful. I would return simply based off of the hospitality even if the food was just ok, but the food delicious!!! I tried all 3 flavors of their turkey wings and their chicken and shrimp and everything was seasoned perfectly. This is the best soul food I've had since leaving the south! I will definitely be making that trip again! Well worth it!",

The staff gives a warm welcome and greets you when you first come in. They go over the food they have with you and ask if you need a minute to decide. I originally found taste of heaven by searching for caterer for my baby shower. The 1st time I walked into the restaurant I was greeted by the smell of food that made my mouth water. The food was so good I decided that day we will be using them for our shower after all. Fast forward a few weeks later I came to pick up the food for the shower and everything was nicely packed, they helped me load my vehicle with the food as well. When I arrived they were just finishing my order which was great to know the food was cooked fresh. Everyone at the shower enjoyed the food and ate so much I only was able to get 1 plate sadly lol but I had a idea that would happen. I will definitely be back to taste of heaven in the future and will try to make monthly trips not only because of the food but the staff. They give you a warm welcome and y\u2019all to you as if you\u2019re family. If that\u2019s not soulful then I don\u2019t know what is. Thanks again!!!",

I didn\u2019t expect the portions to be so large and I didn\u2019t leave room for the dessert; that\u2019s made on location.  I ended up ordering some turkey wings, sides and dessert to go.
