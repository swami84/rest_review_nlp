Hon Kee is one of the few truly authentic places I\u2019ve found outside Chinatown that has the roast pork, duck, and chicken I grew up eating. The quality is great, the prices are fair, and the people are nice. I personally miss the old location, as I\u2019m not a fancy person and it had a nice homey feel to me. This where I go when I miss home.  Favorites are the won ton noodle soup, fish congee, salt pepper smelt, roast and bbq pork, roast duck, chicken, ALL their rice plates, and while I don\u2019t see it on the menu anymore\u2014the Chinese sausage fried rice!  ::NOTE TO ALL::  Just found out last night they\u2019re on Grubhub and ubereats, BUT also looked up how much ubereats and grubhub charges restaurants, and it\u2019s 15-30% for each order + part of the delivery fee and tip. PLEASE, support indie and family restaurants and eateries and order direct from them instead of using a third party app. Andpaying with cash is the best, as card companies charge too. Running a restaurant is not cheap, and I personally want to support these people working so hard to provide such good food.  I\u2019m not affiliated with this restaurant at all, but I\u2019ve noticed prices everywhere going up when it comes to food. Doing a google search on how much third party apps charges restaurants horrified me at how much they take from the restaurants using them.  PLEASE SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS AND PAY IN CASH IF POSSIBLE! Thanks all!",

Inside is bright, spacious, tables for 4 are a good size to ordering lots of food to share, and there a small free parking lot adjacent (I wish I knew ahead of time). We came for a late weekend lunch, so service was prompt and food came out quick. The half order of duck was okay. Definitely not as freshly cooked as I'd hoped but still good. The salt and pepper fish filet was disappointing in portion for $12.99 and very \"bready\". I've been on a losing streak with this dish ordering at various establishments, hopefully someone can restore faith in me. The beef chow fun was good but did have a very distinct smokiness flavor to it. Hard to say if that's intended or not, but still enjoyable. Lastly an order of snow pea tips to balance it all out with a generous bowl of white rice. Good sized portion and no complaints.  Overall I'd say just okay. Would I make another visit? Maybe. Not a bad option for Argyle Street (which still sketches me out day or night) or if you're trying to change it up from the usual Chinatown rotations.  That's all I got on this one. 'Til next time!",

Saturday, July 21, 2018:  Be careful if you walk in alone, look lost or fairly new to the area, the owner will serve old duck and will double charge you for it.  The price is listed on the board and they will tell you otherwise.  First, they will tell you half a duck is $13 then tell you it's $16 but it's actually $8.  After the old cashier lady at the register nudge the owner with her elbow.. was when it became $16.  Then when I point to the price written on the board above and on their menu, she continue to cover up her lies  \"you know.. the duck leg is the most expensive part of the duck\"  I just shrugged it off.  Opening the small 3X3 white  Styrofoam box again, seeing one leg and the rest were dried up 1/4 size duck, w/ price written on top for $13.   I immediately demand fresh duck.  NOT pulled from the fridge, w/ mostly bones and barely any meat.  Looks previous microwaved.  We often commute to Argyle to buy duck, intestines and poultry etcs.   We used own Asian Markets and bought from the area 3-5/week for 20 years.  They tried to swindle and scam the wrong person.  Service here has changed... They were slow & bossy. The old couple in front of me had to wait 15 mins just to get service.  As I was next,  I was informed to stand here and to stand there to order.  Then telling me to move to this register and that register.  I was one of two customers in the whole restaurant. All that hassle and SWINDLING but the second duck & chicken the chef cut up was good.  Rude & Dishonest practices will only last so long. Love tender flavorful chicken...  I'm still debating if it's worth going back for.",

We ordered a noodle dish and it was burnt,the fried rice had egg shells in it. The whole experience was terrible.My family and I will not be going back.

And NOW it is in a high class luxury environment, you gotta visit to see the 9 gorgeous chandeliers, the art work and the beautiful bathrooms. The entrance is not on Argyle at this time.

Some people might think that it seems kind of dingy and I would agree that the interior might need a bit of a touch up but I believe they are about to move to a location just around the corner so this shouldn't be a problem. I'm not going to take away any stars for that because it's not the kind of place is trying to impress people by it's interior design; instead they impress with a large variety of dishes that make you drool as they come out. Alot of good places on argyle but this is one of the best!",

The hot and sour soup sets the bar for all the other restaurants.  The soup is hot as it is sour, just as it should be!  The fried rice isn't oily and it has that grilled taste to it.  As for the beef chow mein, I'm loving the crunchy noodles and large pieces of beef!  I also enjoy their roasted lechon.  True, this restaurant lacks ambiance, but who cares?
