I got beef with rice noodles, peapod leafs, chili chicken and curried chicken casserole.  Cooked to perfection!  It brings back so much memories and great comfort on a rainy cold day.

When asked to speak with a manager she responded she was the manager. All of a sudden the phone drops and a gentlemen is speaking....  To sum up my first experience, it lacked customer service. It was rich with interrupted tones, and not listening to the customer's concerns.  Not wanting the corrected dish for free, which was thrown up in my face, but wanted a win win situation....  Never will support this place again.  Customer Service is known in Hyde Park as always outstanding.  Jade Court appears not to be a good fit for our community.",
