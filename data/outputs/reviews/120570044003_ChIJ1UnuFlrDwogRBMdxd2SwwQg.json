I made it back and I am very disappointed. Portions are very small,  wait time is over 40 minutes, food is not seasoned enough, and my order was incorrect. After our food was ready we realized there was no utensils in our to go bag and it took another 5 to 10 minutes just to get utensils. I ordered a chicken and shrimp pasta and when I got back to the hotel I realized the pasta only had chicken. We also ordered the seafood fries and the portion was very small to begin with and very little seafood. The pasta and fries came out to a little over $30 with tax. Definitely not worth it and will not be returning.",

As a native of Tampa I hung out on Main Street hitting all the clubs in the area. Bar b que king was spot back in the day, just like you are now. I remember when this spot was a pool hall. Enough down memory lane for me.What I didn\u2019t enjoy was the loud explicit rap lyrics from the video channel. Everyone is not in to rap, but there is a better why it can be played without disturbing customers. I will return again so please don\u2019t take this review as a negative. That\u2019s the only reason I couldn\u2019t rate you 5 stars.  Keep up the GREAT JOB !!!!",

My fourth time visiting and I've had to endure longer than usual waits, menu items that have ran out, cold food because of the long wait time and food portion inconsistent. My last visit I waited over 30 minutes which is a bit overkill. I understand they want to make a great reputation of \"made to order\" but this is a bit much. It was jam packed in a small space. I had my newborn and 3year old with me in which we waited in the car, they both took a 30 minute nap and woke up and food still not ready. Everytime I try to support it's either they are out of food, the truck didn't come that day, or they have shrimp but no salad (which was my favorite thing on the menu), sweet potato fries but no fire/ice, wings fried too hard, seafood fries yet the fries were cold and soggy, and lobster Mac n cheese with hardly any lobster. Not too mention overcooked Mac and under seasoned food. With all the hassle and price paid, I don't think I will be coming back. They never have 2 things that match.",
