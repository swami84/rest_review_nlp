It features Mediterranean fare originating from Syria, Lebanon, and Morocco and other countries from that region.  The menu has a lot of vegetarian (veggie kabob, falafel, couscous) options as well as animal-based (chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp, salmon, labneh) options.  I ordered the Custom Plate that let me choose five different salads from a selection of 12.  This and the other dishes we ordered were served with a round doughy bread that was fresh and delicious.  The babaghanoj, hummus, foul, tabouleh, and fatoosh salads that I selected for my dish were very tasty and beautifully presented with olive oil in a long white serving plate.  My son ordered the Falafel Platter.  Considering that he has a very discriminating palate, he gave his dish a stellar review.  I sampled a piece of his falafel and it was quite good.  I ordered a drink called Karkadea. It's made from the hibiscus flower and its minimal sweetness was a perfect complement to my meal.  It had a very fruity and refreshing flavor.  The one negative of this place is that it is housed in a small side-street location that can comfortably seat only six diners inside and four on a sidewalk extension.  I can picture a waiting line form during dinner and lunch hours especially after word-of-mouth of this newly-opened restaurant spreads like wildfire.",
