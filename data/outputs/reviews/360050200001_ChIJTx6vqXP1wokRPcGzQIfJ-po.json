My wife and I ordered the following items on the menu. Fried fish platter, pulled Turkey, fried shrimp, collard greens, spicy cabbage, yams, corn on the cob, Mac & cheese & cornbread. Fish seasoned perfectly, candied yams sweet and solid not soupy or mushy, the collard greens reminded me of my wife\u2019s grandmas greens (HMMMMM). The pulled turkey moist and delish. The fried shrimp were AWESOME. I am a big fan of cabbage and the spicy cabbage hit home with the perfect kick. Mashed potatoes were good. If you order the cob corn do yourself a favor and get the large one perfectly grilled they sprinkle it with seasoning, if I didn\u2019t value my life I would of took my wife\u2019s corn. Deliciousness can not begin to express my satisfaction with the food. This small cozy well decorated cafe has a staff that was awesome. When I got home I noticed that the cob corn was missing from my order so I called Ralph the owner picked up listened, apologized and rushed me my cob corn. Ralph thank you for bringing your cafe to my neighborhood. I will be returning and I can\u2019t wait to we can enjoy your food right in your well decorated cafe. I am certain this soul food cafe will help kick start these small independent restaurants that provide exceptional service and great food to the BX.",
