The karaage was delicious. The uni udon was perfectly creamy. Meat skewers and alcohol selection fantastic! Can't wait to go again.",

Had the momo, negima, ume tsukune, and buta bara.  Additionally had the Takoyaki and hamachi kama.  Definitely will be checking it out again when able.",

Everything here is excellent.  Their kushiyaki (deliciousness on a skewer grilled over the hottest charcoal known to humanity) is life-changing. Their noodle dishes are soul-warming. Their sushi and sashimi are inspired and extremely fresh. There's also an assortment of menu items here that are near-impossible to find outside of a pub in Japan.  I could go on, but you owe it to yourself to come here and try it for yourself.  Simply put, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  (Pictures to come soon!)",
