Our server seemed to take time to warm up. Not sure if it was just a long day. Then to the food and drinks. We ordered a Ceasar salad which was delicious but when I asked for dressing as it wasn't properly dressed they charged me for the extra dressing. Ok weird, I eat out everyday and never been charged for dressing. Then to the wings, average taste and fried well, not a fan of the quality of the wings. Sauce was amazing. Garlic parmasean to be exact. Buffalo was Ok. The ribs, they are worth it in size and cost. Could use a baby back instead of a full rib rack. Had a martini and it contained way to much vermouth. But my girlfriend was no longer hungry when we left so good job.",

No issues with service, and the prices were pretty good too! My only issue was that the mashed potatoes tasted like those pur\u00e9ed boxed powder mashed potatoes. They did not seem fresh and were way over salted. They should have been thick, creamy, buttery and well seasoned without the excess salt. I also did not enjoy the tiny onion rings on top of the mashed potatoes, definitely left a weird after taste. Try the chicken and waffles or chicken and veggies, but not the mash. All in all, I would come back.",

Just thinking about it makes me salivate. The cheese, the bun, oh my. The deliver eggs were also delicious. We also had fries which were nice and the perfect crispiness. We had wine too.

Case in point, the pesto mac & cheese.  Unexpectedly delectable.  The fried chicken was sublime as advertised - great breading in particular.  I usually don't put sauces on good fried chicken, but because this dish comes with a gravy, a hot sauce and a blueberry honey, I gave them a shot.  All 3 were tasty, but the blueberry honey is killer.  Finally, the burger is tasty and well balanced (though I wish it came with fries). The wait staff was notably friendly and attentive.  Nice and inventive cocktail selection, too. I'm looking forward to visiting The Ryerson in the coming years, and watching how it evolves.",
