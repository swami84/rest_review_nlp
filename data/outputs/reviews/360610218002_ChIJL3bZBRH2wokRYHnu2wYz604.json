It didn't just have bad texture but also left a bad taste in my mouth. I also got a (home-made) tiramisu and it was sour... Which is short to say they served me expired dessert.

Unfortunately, in this new world we live in, pretending to wear masks by hanging them under your chin or under your nose doesn't cut it, especially when you're handling the food, the box it comes in, and when we have to go into the same room with the staff to pay for it and pick it up. Before covid, it would be a 5 star, but I'm disappointed enough in the restaurant to have to post this and hope either some change will come out of it or I can just inform others that this is how your food will be prepared and waiting for you.  I picked up a pizza a few weeks ago and asked the staff to put their masks fully on. They smiled and kept working without them. I walked by today to see them still working the same way.  I see someone else posted 2 months before me about the place not adhering to covid best practices, so this can be an update to all reading that they are still maintaining the status quo even though managements response to the other post was that they will improve. Talk is cheap.",

Seriously i am a sauce freak and the cauliflower pizza with the bacon and caramelized onion were insanely good. Best pizza without red sauce I've ever had...

The pizza is delicious and the ingredients are very similar to the ones they use in Italy. The 3rd order was a disaster. The order was almost an hour and a half late. When I called them after an hour, they said they were just making the pizza now. She said it would take an hour, I told her it was already an hour. When we received the 3 pizzas, it was obvious that they were dropped and all 3 were a disaster, stuck to the top of the lid and the boxes were wet from the rain. The delivery man handed them to us wet without an insulated cover to keep them hot and dry. Needless to say I asked for my money back.",

The frosting is light, yet flavorful; the cake is fluffy and moist.  The Brooklyn Blackout Cake is to die for. The perfect cupcake for chocolate lovers, it's several layers of chocolate cake with chocolate pudding inside, topped with chocolate frosting. I thought the chocolate would overwhelm me (although I'm a chocolate lover), but the different types of chocolate within this one cupcake kept the cupcake interesting and desirable.  The yellow cake with chocolate frosting was also a delicious take on a \"classic\" style cupcake; it reminds you of what your grandma would have made for you when you were little (if your grandma was the type to bake cupcakes). Again, both the frosting and cake parts were worthwhile - both separately and together.  The New York cheesecake is also one of my favorite cheesecakes (the only place that has better is Zanze's in San Francisco). It's light, smooth, moist, and not overly sweet with a delicious crust that doesn't overpower the flavor of the cheesecake itself.  The lines here can be quite long - service is very friendly but slow. It's sweet that they chat it up with each customer, but it can be a bit frustrating when the line is out the door. Still, the cupcakes and cheesecake are all worth the wait.",

I got the Margherita pie to-go for about $12 dollars and there were 6 slices. They have a spanking new brick oven and they serve made-to-order pies. The place is small with full-service seating area that fits about 10-12 people.  The pizza is like a personal pan pizza, as it's very thin and small. I like the crust - it's chewy, fresh, soft inside and crunchy outside. The toppings are a joke, because they're too skimpy on the cheese and basil when I visited. It's pretty sad cause there's not even a single leaf on each slice. I've had at least 2-3 basil leaves on one slice from other places. Look at my picture and tell me if I'm wrong. Despite my love for pizza, I'll definitely not coming back for more.",
