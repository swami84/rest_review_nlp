Our server was fine,  although admittedly don\u2019t think he did a great job explaining some of the dishes and not equipped to answer questions we asked. I ordered the half chicken and side salad and my friend ordered a shrimp salad. All in all chicken was fine -  it was well cooked but taste and flavor were just average. I am not sure i would go back... would rather stick w my go to places.",

It only comes with a half slab so for the price it\u2019s not really worth it if you have a big appetite. My date had a steak which was cooked very well. Everything was cooked good but they missed on the flavor and seasoning. Also the Mac and Cheese was underwhelming (if you\u2019re a true soul food eater) If you\u2019re coming here on a date you may enjoy it but don\u2019t have high expectations.",

Attentive, professional service by eloquent staff.  Well...not this time! My wife and I stopped by for dinner a few nights ago. We were seated right away, greeted by the waiter and promptly ordered a bottle of sparkling wine, a glass of Santory, and the crab dip appetizer.  It took the waiter a solid 15 minutes to return with the drink order. The appetizer finally arrived with an amount of bread which underwhelmed the dip, so we waited for him to return...until the dip was cold, solid cheese.  I received my steak in a reasonable amount of time, but alas, the waiting game to receive the knife.  Ordering additional glasses of wine and hoping/praying for additional toast to finish our dip was grueling. Our server/aka \"the invisible man\" appeared sporadically, as if evading the CIA, only to return at the very end rushing us to \"finish up\"! He had not even cleared the dishes, let alone, accomplished any other important aspects of serving! Appalling! This place is out of the rotation. And unless you care to eat cold food without proper utensils, order a bottle of wine and pour it yourself AND be rushed by a magician during your meal...allllllllll while having 20% gratuity added, visit the onslaught of other establishments at the wharf. $240 down the tubes... Suffice it to say, as we exited the establishment, we attempted to make mention of this unusual fiasco to \"Justin\" the manager who was unbelievably dismissive. I understand wanting to close down the restaurant, but my mouth was open. It was unreal.",

We had the lamb skewers, the crab dip and deviled eggs for an appetizer. The skewers were impeccable as well as the deviled eggs we did not like the crab dip too much of a cheesy taste and not enough crab. For an entree we had the beef short rib. I had the double baked mashed potato (excellent) my husband had the sweet potato ( another excellent choice) the short rib was served with the bordelaise sauce. The prime rib was so tender you could cut into it with a spoon. For dessert we had the chocolate cake absolutely Devine. I would recommend this place to anyone.",

I was throughly unimpressed. 80$ for two salads and a appetizer dish of mussels. The water given to us smelled funny and tasted like it was from the sink, the salad.. a simple Cesar salad was butchered with the overwhelming taste of anchovies and lemon .. way too much lemon. The mussels were mediocre at best, they didn\u2019t taste fresh.  I don\u2019t eat beef or pork, so my options were limited  I will mention that all this was addressed with the waiter. He apologized for the quality of the food and brought out a single scoop of ice cream as compensation.  All in all, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be going back.",

Gorgeous atmosphere, and our host Allam made me feel all the more welcome, going above and beyond to ensure my time there was delightful.  The food (I ordered the express steak and fries) was quite flavorful, with a special sauce that paired nicely with each bite without being overbearing. The Herbed fries were just simply amazing! They have a nice texture to them ( not to crsipy, not to soft) and is easily some of the best fries I've ever had.  Next, the hibiscus sorbet. (I must say beforehand, that I'm not big on dessert) BUT, it was good.  Really potent, a bit tart, but just REALLY sweet.  In conclusion: make a reservation asap so that The Grill can bless your soul!",

Ordered Halibut with risotto, and with (*moderate) expectations at nearly $40 per plate, the risotto tasted like chewy chlorinated rice-a-roni, except worse. Burger was good, but not as advertised, menu says sun dried tomatoes on the burger. When it came out, regular tomatoes. Not a deal breaker per say, but when asked for more detail as for the reason (ran out, changed menu, any offering of peace, etc.), we received a confused apology and not seeing our server again until the check. It's unfortunate to see, but most people have certain expectations of what 40+ dollar/plate should be (no nonsense, as advertised, and generally good) and The Grill was not it.",

Mind you we made reservations, there was no bar due to COVID, and it was chilly outside so we really had no choice but to sit inside. I felt so disrespected and disappointed they ruined his 30th MILESTONE bday dinner killed the vibe we wound up calling it a night. Manager was very rude before kicking us out. Waitress said they didn't have tastings for champagnes by the bottles only by the glass. I asked her if they had any champagnes by the bottle also by the glass and she said no. Then proceeded to turn to the champagne by the glass page which had some that were also by the bottle and didn't apologize or acknowledge her error. Very dismissive mandatory 20% gratuity.

The hostess showed a bad attitude and was not helpful, at all, with at least trying to allow me and my party of five to enjoy outside seating. I am planning to tell of my friends and colleges to not support this restaurant.",

Forgot all about my soda. Then the manager or w.e he was, was very rude, pulled me aside, said if i head to the bathroom you must have your mask on , or he will be fined, well than maybe put some signs up around the restaurant about wearing a mask, instead of just outside, cuz it makes it look like you only have to wear a mask when your being waited to seat. Then when I said , I saw other people walking to the restroom without a mask on, he said so does that mean your gonna follow them. Like seriously, totally rude. Might be good idea to have signs up around the restaurant, wear mask when not sitting at the table. Totally rude, he could of approach me alot better than being rudeee.",

I asked the foodrunner for my cutlery, he immediately answered my call, no complaint from Asia !! I started to enjoy my salmon as if nothing happened !! Something clear those who accompanied me clearly could use their hands and fingers were fries and hamburger !!!! But I ate well and my drink ended up with the bite in my throat wauuu omg what happened at the table they sat down after my family and I had what was necessary to enjoy their food but I did not pray that someone would bring me another drink!!

The sun is bright so shades are a must unless you get a table in the shade. No worries once the sun starts to set the atmosphere is perfect. The food was delicious from the beginning to the end. The crab dip was uniquely loose and had a citrus flavor but plenty of lump crab meat to go around. The Ribeye was seasoned to perfection. However, the amount of marble could be deemed overwhelming if the ribeye isn't your favorite cut of steak. Add a crabcake for a surf and turf experience. The crabcake was light and tasty. The creamy spinach and twice baked potatoes matched perfectly. The serving size is shareable so come with a big appetite. A perfect spot for a special occasion, date with your spouse or girl's night out. Ps. Be prepared to wait due to limited seating capacity because of COVID19 but the food is worth the wait #fallynsfoodieexcursions #fallynsfoodieexcursionscovid19edition #thegrilldc #dcwharf #dateday",

This place serves as the epitome of customer service; I want to spend my money HERE!! Thank you all for Michelle- w/ out her my return would\u2019ve been avoided. The eye contact, warmth in connection, and professionalism is what lit the spark to make us want to return in order to indulge in whatever keepsake she penetrated through her eyes. I am forever grateful for that ounce of customer service! Sergio... I can\u2019t say enough; a raise will do him well! As a culprit of the service industry- I can honestly say... he deserves EVERYTHING that the universe blesses him with. Had I won the last lottery- I would\u2019ve offered him a package that would\u2019ve had him set for life... all just to stand in my hallway as the model he is and shine! Thank you for the beautiful staff. Everyone was enduring throughout our experience. The lovely lady with the beaded necklace who seated us- down to the natural haired lady w/ the low cut- made this the ultimate encounter. Last BUT surely not least- I want to pay special attention to JoJo. Many people are NOT meant to perfect the managerial position of Manager/GM in the DMV F&B market- especially African American men. JoJo excels above both! Neither race or gender has defined his professionalism in searing this brand to the expertise in which one demands while prowling the service industry. The simple gesture of coming over and asking for feedback and introducing himself was enough. Most people like to stand behind the scenes, twiddle their thumbs and hope for the best- but JoJo was frontline- demanding customer interaction. I want to give a special thanks to JOJO for leading a team of beautiful, intelligent, experienced and well-groomed associates. His stature is a direct reflection of the ambiance that is curtailed in the space provided to enjoy the luxurious delicacies. Thank you- Thank you & THANK YOU!!",

Our server welcomed us to their \u201cfancy slice of Miami vice;\u201d and the restaurant was a wood, blue, and gold version of Art Deco Miami.  and We both had a \u201cRum Me Over\u201d drinks and the onion dip to start...both were light and smooth. The server then recommended the grilled cauliflower (garnished with superb mushrooms and radish, and large enough to share) and the cream of spinach (garnished with crispy fried onions and served in a small cast iron pot). Both were delicious! We then finished with the apple galette. It was all wonderful, and the servers and hosts checked several times to make sure everything went well,",

I had a small problem with the food and I\u2019m not a big proponent of making a fuss of things so I kept eating and didn\u2019t say anything. After dinner the manager came and asked if everything was ok with the food and since he asked I told him what happened. He was very apologetic and went and actually got us a piece of chocolate cake for our table to share. It was very pleasant and never had to wait on a waiter.",
