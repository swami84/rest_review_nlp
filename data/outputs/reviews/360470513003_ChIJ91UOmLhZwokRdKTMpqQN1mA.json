We had to wait over an hour for our food with no updates at all, I had to wave down at least 3 of the waiters to ask them about the status of our food. The manager could've gave us complimentary drinks for the wait but that didn't happen.  When the food arrived it was good, everything was fresh and hot. (7/10) Another thing, my family ordered 3 margarita pitchers for our table & you can only taste a DAB of alcohol in each pitcher SMH definitely not worth $35 dollars. Hookah 8/10.",

Decorative and ambiance in fine and service was good in general but food was a disappointment. We order queso fundido, something from northern Mexico that is melted and comes, usually,  with wheat tortillas (I asked the server and she said that was the way they serve it), what we get was more like a reddish cheese soup with corn tortillas, taste was bland, look was terrible, nothing attractive; coffee has a very strange cinnamon flavor, which they don\u2019t disclose on the menu so we have the asked for regular coffee because that  one was not pleasant. I asked for a breakfast burrito, which was ok but the flavor was probably intended for suburban costumer not used to Mexican food, something more for Chilly than for a place that present itself as Mexican, my companion asked for huevo rancheros, nice look for again, just not the Mexican taste that you would expect if you have been in Mexico or in the south border states. In general, I would say the place targets the costumer looking for a margarita and a \u201cMexican inspired\u201d food but not for those who are familiar to the real Mexican food.",

Do not judge a book by its cover, because of pandemic now some places look kind of wack in the outside. Besides that, Chuys Cantina did a pretty decent job in the backyard organization and decorations. The food had a nice presentation and the taste was unexpectedly amazing! Vibes were on point with the latin music and the hookah with the classy look of a clase azul bottle. Service was as expected on a busy Friday, they just made a little mistake with my order, but as any good restaurant would do, ( yes you guessed it) they fixed it with a free drink!",

Works great for either a date night or family dinner/Brunch. I went here to celebrate my mother's birthday. The service we received was beyond my expectation. The server was very patient and kind when we asked to substitute one of the dishes she got it done for us (My moms request). The drinks are amazing and excellent price. The food was delicious, seasoned perfectly and the presentation was exquisite. The server discreetly brang the b-day girl churros and her face lit up. They also brang us a bottle of champagne to celebrate her birthday. Thank you for truly making my moms 60th birthday feel special during this pandemic. We will DEFINITELY be back for other occasions. Also for anyone that likes Hookah, they have that also",

        "caption": "This was the worst dining experience I\u2019ve had in years. I\u2019m convinced the other reviews are not real. I went for a dinner with friends Friday night, it was awful. Service was atrocious, our waiter ignored us throughout our meal and seemed totally apathetic to our issues (we had to ask to order at least 3 times, being told not now twice, super slow and literally laughed when asked if the kitchen could cook a burger medium - this was the strongest response we got at all, with our waiter saying he strongly doubted they\u2019d care). When the food did come, over an hour after we sat down, it was cold and gross. The queso fundido was congealed and gross looking (it also came with our entrees despite several requests for it to come out first - as appetizers are supposed to), the nachos were cold to touch with unmelted cheese (like it had come straight from the fridge), the fajitas were cold, not sizzling or even steaming - and weren\u2019t fajitas, just chicken and peppers and onions with a side of cold tortillas, the burger was overdone and the fries were cold. The burrito was hot but pretty funky. The margaritas (tamarind and jalape\u00f1o) were weak and way too sweet. When we complained, our waiter dismissed us and didn\u2019t address anything or care. Overall, it\u2019s confusing why this place is opened, the food sucks and the service is even worse. There are so many great restaurants in this neighborhood, don\u2019t waste your time or money.",
