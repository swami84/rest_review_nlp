Not fair to the staff that did care, but Hyde Park has an ambiance of it's own. Dark, cozy,  and if you are with your Boo \"perfect\" for a romantic candle lit Evening. Pork Chop has always had a stage for entertainment so that is a  HUGE PLUS, this location has a WELL STOCKED BAR!!!! My Son wanted to  take me out for Valentine's and given cheaper options he still chose Pork Chop, we normally hit them once or twice a year-- so ok. Had never known them to up charge for \"premium sides\" but I enjoyed my BBQ 2 COMBO and He loves their Cajun Fettuccine, so all was fine Bread Pudding was dessert(he was not a fan of the Red Beans). He didn't like the bill total,  so Mom helped and we were on our way.... Thanks",

Oh and ask him a question and won't make you feel like your question is not obvious or silly when it wasn't obvious or silly. When ordering please find our menu in the midst of the menu for red fish bleu fish. Wait is this a seafood restaurant or BBQ joint. Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the service, location or food.

We sampled each other\u2019s varied dishes such as the catfish, fried chicken, appetizers, seafood dishes and a variety of meats, each dish was consistently bland, dry and offensive to the palate.  The price points charged are not commensurate with the quality of the dishes.  In other words, the prices are way too high and the quality of the food is way too low.  Of note, the gumbo was average, not offensive.  This establishment is struggling and unless something changes quickly, stick a fork in this place.",

Porkchop is always being recommended to me so I knew this was my chance to see what the hype was about. I was disappointed. The Porkchop in Hyde park is a combination of two restaurants, Porkchop and bleu fish. This is strange from the get go, but I rolled with it. The issue though is that the menu is overloaded with items so it took us a solid fifteen minutes to get through the menu and figure out what we were going to order. Porkchop is a bbq restaurant and bleu fish is a fish and steak restaurant. So going through the menu you have to decide what you really want to eat but everything is together. Additionally, so many items are market price that you are confronted with decision fatigue by the time you are ordering.  The service itself was okay. There was only one other table of people so...we got attention though usually at inopportune times.  As for the food, it was...okay. My husband and I shared a full slab of ribs, lobster Mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts. It tasted good, but by no means the \"best\". The Brussel sprouts were not good and I don't recommend them.  My friends enjoyed their food: bacon wrapped dates, cheese fries, cornbread.  The plus side is that there are plenty of options but the downside is that there may be too many options so they don't do one thing well.",

The employees were not aware of the menu listed on the website. We were served part of our order and we paid full price. They requested we pay before we were served. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone. We were there over an hour before the food was served. The salad was brought out after the main course was served. The manager didn\u2019t what dressing was on the salad.",

I understand times have gotten hard and you had to combine two places into one but the service, quality of food, and atmosphere should not have been compromised.  I have a feeling that the people working their may be family and friends helping out because there doesnt seem to ne much life in them. This place has definitely  dropped. If things dont get better i feel like porK and the fish will get the chop. I  used to could recommend this place to people.  The only good thing from this moment is that id didnt have to face it alone and the fried pickles for the  moment were good.",

I ordered a nacho platter that the server  highly recommended to hold us over until our food arrived. When the nachos arrived it look like vomit all the nachos it was thrown together and looked horrible so that was a wasted 13 bucks. My brother ordered the hippie burger he stated it was good but he will eat anything so that was questionable. I had half of chicken, mash potatoes and cream spinach the taste of the chicken was weird mash was ok but the spinach tasted like they went straight to the garden pulled the spinach tossed in a pan for 30 seconds to warm it up and plated it. It tasted HORRIBLE like dirt!!!! My kids ordered burgers my daughter food came late because he did not put the order in. He took off 5 bucks, I didn\u2019t bother to even say anything because I would never frequent this business again. I\u2019m shocked it\u2019s even in the Harper court, maybe last night was a rough night but a horrible impression to where I would tell everyone to RUN FROM PORKCHOPS in Hyde park. I never leave reviews but this establishment needed one.",

When asked where the other order was, she said it was on it's way, but then came back 7 minutes later, to ask what was the order so she can put it in! Then said that she was only manager there for 3 weeks and they asked for her, she didn't ask for the job. THAT has nothing to do with the good customer service. She then said if we knew what was going on in the kitchen, we'd be surprised...WHAT?! This is a brief summation of a horrible experience. That lasted until 4:17 PM. After almost 2 hours, wrong orders of the food what we did receive,  missing order of food we did order and poor customer service.  I would never go back and certainly would not recommend it to anyone.",

It another 30 minutes before our food came out.  The food was to neither of our liking.   We asked to see the manager.  She did come over and we told that the food wasn't good.  The rice was like the boil in the bag.  We did eat the Shrimp because we both were very hungry.  She asked if we wanted anything else my friend said no and I said I would try the brisket.   They came out with a sample to see if I liked it.  It was horrible.  My friend and I just ate the bread and I finished off my coleslaw.   Then the waitress came over to tell us that they were going to take half off of our entrees and that was it.  My friend and I just said  it's ok because we wouldn't be back.  We both thought that the manager should have come over to explain the bill.  Poor management skills. And now we see why the place was empty and all the other restaurants in the area was crowded.    Will not ever go back there again!!!!",

The food overall was good in flavor but the portions of the servings were far from satisfying my appetite at the time.  Which I take partial blame for, the server was pleasant enough but failed to recomend a more hearty choice for my appetite. I decided to try the chocolate lava cake which was also a bad idea,  it was dry and wasn't fresh at all. I was not satisfied with my meal given what I paid and the portions that were served. I could've gotten bigger portions at a much lower price point, sorry Porkchop, but as I told my server, I won't be returning to your establishment. I'll give you two stars, one for the server and one for the fish.",

No menues were given,  we had to borrow them groom a neighbors table that had left.  After 20 minutes of sitting written 1 glass of water i looked around the restaurant to try and make contact with any server and there were NONE!
