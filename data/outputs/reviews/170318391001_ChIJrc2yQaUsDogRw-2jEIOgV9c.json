The chicken chili soup was incredible, and the garlic bread was just about the best I've had in my entire life. I of course wanted to have the chicken pot pie, since it was the first dish ever served there (more than 110 years ago) and it was excellent! My daughter had the mandarin salad, and was very pleased. Lattes and cappucinos to drink - both delicious. Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, excellent service - five stars from beginning to end!",

The tree is cool,  but the hostesses are unprofessional and pretty rude. We had a table for 2 that was on the main thoroughfare of everyone being seated that barely had enough room for people to get through so literally everyone who walks by feels awkward and ends up inadvertently touching the table. That table wouldn\u2019t be there at all in any other restaurant. The food is decent. The waitstaff is nice. The red lighting feels like a horror movie and then the fairy godmothers top off the trippy bizarro atmosphere. It\u2019s really a shame that the vents on the second level haven\u2019t been cleaned- they make the room feel dirty and that\u2019s an easy fix. The upper levels of the room really need some TLC to bring it up to par for the historic value that it has.  I can\u2019t believe how popular dining here is. It must just be nostalgia, but the facility is certainly not maintaining the whole space as it should be. It honestly felt like a scene from The Shining. The red lights are just awful. It\u2019s so creepy.  It was still worth it. It was certainly an experience we won\u2019t forget and was highly amusing. Such a historic landmark deserves a better overall staff that appreciates the history and can behave professionally.",

Got in fairly easily with a group of 12, with 5 kids. The buffet was good for the kids. Adults all had entrees. Most had salads, which looked pretty good. I had the meatloaf which was pretty tasty and about a perfect portion, just enough. The Walnut Old Fashioned cocktail was too sweet for my tastes, but it had a fantastic walnut flavor. The Fairy Princess shtick was entertaining for the little girls we had with us 2, 6, 7, 8, and 10. And of course the enormous Christmas Tree in the main room was a hit with the adults. Good holiday family dinner for a special night out with the kids.",

This year, the menu was drastically reduced and did not include my favorite: the field's special nor did it include my favorite cinnamon holiday drink, which was the start of my troubles today. I ordered something else, the eggnog brandy drink, but promptly returned it. My waitress informed me that I no longer qualified for my mug \ud83d\ude21. I asked to speak to a manager because that was the last straw for me. After about 15 min my waitress came back and told me that THE MANAGER DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO COME AND SPEAK TO ME!! She did give me a holiday mug, and I don't fault her for lack of service, but I am disgusted at the fact that this institution would disrespect their patrons that way. ALWAYS make time for a customer who asks to see a manager, you never know what they may have to say, who they are, OR WHO THEY KNOW.",

So I tried calling the number on their website which takes you to a recording and then a full mailbox so you can't leave a msg. 9/10 times opentable is wrong, if you call directly you can get a reservation. Perfect example is Cafe Babareeba. Every time I try opentable it says booked, when I call the restaurant I get a reservation no problem. This has happened easily 2 or 3 times a year for like 8 yrs now. What a let down. Better luck next year I guess?  Also on the Macy's site if you try to access the walnut room page it leads you to a network solutions page, meaning they haven't paid their web host bill or didn't update their links. Seems like a poorly run operation.  I'll update this review once they fix their issues...",

In the hallways near and surrounding, there are plenty of photos and artifacts to enjoy while you wait. I enjoyed brunch this past Sunday. The room is currently managed by Gino and you won't find a more genial host who cares more about maintaining the grand reputation he inherited with his job. Well done, Gino and your team!

For Chicago, the prices are also reasonable. However, service was terrible. Another table was seated after me and they received their food, ate, and paid before my main food came.   We also did not receive our drinks in a timely manner.  The staff seemed to have checked out mentally. They were very depressed and did not appear to want to be there.  If you go to the Walnut Room, go for the food, but give yourself lots of extra time, because the service is terrible.  Also, since the top floor has been sold, you can no longer see the Christmas tree. You can only see it if you eat at the restaurant.  This is a big disappointment, and will affect my visits to Macy's and the Walnut Room in the future. With the poor service and the inability to see the tree and other stunning displays in the restaurant, there is no reason to visit.",

The hostess sat us and gave us only 2 menus. We were sat in the center of the room around the art projects, which had led color shifting lights. We found the lights too bright and distracting.  The server was nice. We got ice water, diet coke and iced tea. We were never offered refills at any time from any of the waitstaff. Our orders were simple but took almost 45 minutes. One of the items was wrong. Our guest received the skirt steak salad instead of the sandwich. No compensation was made to the bill.  Another guest asked for ketchup. An easy ask that wasn't filled until we waylaid another staff member to get it 15 minutes later.  All in all, the Walnut Room has gone downhill from previous years and we will pass on eating there again. Very disappointed!",

The clock at State and Washington.  Window shopping at Marshall Fields. The chill in the air. Snowflakes whirling in the wind. Coming inside. Up to the seventh floor. The wait never mattered.  A lovely formal space with that resplendent Christmas tree. Not just paneled with wood. Rich intricately grained English Circassian Walnut. Austrian Crystal fixtures. A refined place that commands proper comportment yet the visiting fairies, the fairy dust and festive decorations make the occasion a delight. In the past I enjoyed \u00e0 la carte Lobster Bisque. The Original Mrs Hering Chicken Pot Pie. Frango Mint Ice Cream Pie. I did not care for the change to buffet, nor the odd lighting - which took away from the elegant simplicity of the Tree being the highlight. Also found the attitude of the help not up to the previous standard of service. Before - no reservations. Sure it got crowded, the wait could be long, the room noisy at times. No matter. Each year I came was special - because of who I was with. What we were doing. The time of year. Fields had a style, a strategy, a tradition of excellence it upheld. Felt differently after Fields closed.  Now so clearly a Macy's restaurant.  Previously so ingrained as a part of my personal rituals that I thought nothing can change that special feeling. That impeccable grace and gentility. Here. At the Walnut Room. At Christmas.",

A lot of great holiday cocktails as well! Ask to get a seat near the tree, but during the holidays, the wait can be upwards of 2 hours. Reservations for the holidays open around early November and book up pretty quickly so be on the lookout! It does run after Christmas as well which tends to be less crowded.",

The past few years we have experienced cold food served , pieces of plastic bags in the mashed potatoes, undercooked meat and vegetables, cocktails ordered at the beginning of the meal coming out well after the entrees were served, service that repeatedly said \"saLmon\" (hard L), incorrect drinks/food and just overall terrible food and service. It was a top grade restaurant back when Marshall Fields owned it, now its an over priced TGI Fridays. Complaints are usually met with surprise and apologies and maybe some comped drinks, but for the price we shouldn't be complaining about the same things for several years in a row. Their beautiful tree can be viewed from the floor above, no need to waste your money eating in front of it when there are hundreds of restaurants in the area with much better food, drinks and service. We have unfortunately put an end to a 30+ year tradition after this year.",

There were 4 entrees to choose from or 26.00 for a buffet. Pot pie, breaded chicken, salmon, or meat loaf. I had soup and salad but the salad was a wedge of lettuce with two uncut slices spread over the top on a bed of marble rye bread buttered and two slices of cheese on the bread.  Thin slice of tomato, boiled egg and one black olive on a skewer.  Weirdest dashboard I've ever had.  Chicken was good but served with boxed mashed and 4 green beans.  Nice tree but good was not worth it.....",

It may have been easier to notice because the holiday throngs weren't present to hide the need for a coat of paint on the walls or the deep cleaning needed in the bathroom. The staff seemed young and inexperienced, immature to what Macy's and the tree used to be. Just stopped in for a drink and ended up getting some hummus as well; pretty average-nothing special about it. Definitely not worth what they charged for it. The tree was beautiful though and definitely worth seeing but it seems as though Macy's has stopped putting effort into the holidays. Windows were mediocre-seemed to be a similar theme to the last few years. Maybe they should take the next year and reevaluate themselves, maybe don't put the decorations up at Halloween..",

I will say that our waitress was great. She was polite, prompt, and courteous.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for most of the rest of the staff we encountered. Additionally, the cleanliness was subpar on this visit.  Many of the staff were pushing their way past the customers shouting \"coming through\" or \"at your back\", rather than a more polite caution.  I actually observed that when someone did not move as quickly as they liked, they would actually nudge them with whatever tray or cart they were trying to get past with.  In particular, one waitress pushed her way past me, and my 11 year old son, and then proceeded to keep the tray she was carrying (full of food and drink) pressed against my wife's head while shouting \"coming through\". There was nowhere for us to go because there was a line of people in front of us as we were trying to leave. It actually hurt my wife's head where the tray was being pressed in.  This is unacceptable behavior and the first time I have observed this level of rudeness there.  When we were first brought to the table (after a 5 hour wait) the hostess wasn't sure which table was supposed to be ours.  She ended us getting seated but there were spilled sauce cups and used napkins around the table.  They did end up cleaning those up once we pointed this out.  I noticed similar cleanliness issues throughout the restaurant as they hurriedly tried to rush people through the dinner service.  Finally, and I acknowledge this was our decision to stay, the idea of a buffet style dinner is not to my liking. I feel that the traditional menu service would make for a more pleasing experience.  Instead, you are left to wait in long lines while also getting pushed past by staff shouting \"behind you\" while carrying hot containers of food.  This may have been the end of this tradition for my family and I.",

The waiter believed it to be eggnog. The food was \"meh\" at best. We had our dinners on the table about 4 minutes after ordering, meaning the food is premade and sitting in a warming drawer. The crusted chicken was soggy and tastes like something from a microwave dinner, as did the heat n' serve imitation mashed potatoes that came with it. The chicken pot pie is a bowl of creamy chicken noodle soup with a cold flaky circle shaped crossaint on top to give the illusion that you're getting a real pot pie. The $7.00 slice of pie was good. -- Then for the grande finale, we ended up sick in the bathroom before even leaving the building. I had 2 more trips to the bathroom at the train station as well as up through the night with stomach pains, nausea, headache which is probably from dehydration. We had dinner 14 hours ago and I'm still sick. We won't be back and that breaks mye heart.",

I love how there were women dressed as princesses (I forgot what they were calling themselves) that were going around granting wishes-- it added to the magical experience for my little ones, as well as myself. Our waitress... I cannot say enough about her. She was absolutely incredible! Then to top of our experience, we received a cute little mug with the year on it. LOVED it, we'll be back!",

We waited about 30 minutes and during that time we were only giving water. No one introduced themselves as a waiter or took an an order that entire time.  Truly, I wouldnt waste my time here. Instead we walked down the street to Remington's and had a lovely prime rib where they actually gave us an extra 10 oz because it was the last of that cut. Excellent and attentive service there. Great food and a much better experience.  I hope the odds are ever in your favor to actually get service at the Walnut room.",

When I did finally get their attention the host explained to me that there was an hour long wait. It didn't make sense to me that the wait was that long with only 3 tables in the restaurant. The chefs apparently even had enough time to conversate at the host stand. Whatever, I gave them my name and number and they told me they would call me when a table is ready. Before leaving I asked the manager for the restroom, she gave me directions for a restroom that was located away from the restaurant. She did not allow me to use the restroom inside. Upon reaching this bathroom I was greeted with urine soaked walls and feces smeared in the stalls, absolutely disgusting.  And to top it all off, they never called me for my table. This restaurant clearly doesn't want anyone to come in, youre better off taking your business somewhere else. Head a block down onto Michigan avenue where restaurants actually care about service.",
