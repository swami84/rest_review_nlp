Starters, entrees, sides, desert, all stunning. We started at the bar with an array of cocktails then had dinner and a show, which might seem odd but not at all. It was quite seamless and amazing. We had a table in front of the stage but really any seat is good and I\u2019d probably recommend a booth. In a sea of sameness Monarque is an unique and individual experience. Plus, the Elk Room is right there and you can stroll the harbor within a block before or after dinner. We\u2019ve tried most of the Atlas Group restaurants and highly recommend any of them.",

I was not satisfied with my experience at all. I decided to come here to celebrate my birthday, and was genuinely disappointed. The customer service needs some work. I was seated at the bar after the hostess informed me that she did not have any tables available. The bartender asked me if I would be dining and I said yes, he gave a menu and walked away allowing time for me to decide what I wanted to order. Not once did he come back over, and ask if I was ready to order. The entire time I had to ask for everything. NOT ONCE was I asked if I needed anything, or how was my order. The steak was ok, I\u2019ve had better. The cocktails was ok, I\u2019ve had better. The burlesque show was just ok. This is not the type of restaurant you go to,to celebrate a birthday. Everything was just ok, not worthy of $100 plus bill. I also felt I may have been pre-judged based off of the way I look. This will be my first, and last time coming here. I could have gone to Ruth\u2019s Chris, The Prime Rib, or Capital Grille  and would have received better service.",

We waited a little while and were allowed to replace another party leaving the bar.  I think this was because we did not have dinner there.  We saw other people latter filling-up the place, but all were having dinner.  Good cocktails but fairly pricy.  Not more than you would pay at any other premium bar in Harbor East though.  Absinthe was very good and strong, great for the French atmosphere.  That atmosphere was excellent, definitely recommend going just for that.  We also had a chocolate mousse that was outstanding.  The show was more entertainment than show, good for Baltimore, but don't expect Vegas.",

We went for a romantic steak dinner, but the loud music made it hard to converse and we didn't have a great view of the sporadic entertainment. This place primarily serves steaks, and the prices are a la cart (so you pay for the sides seperately). Based on the atmosphere, this is more a place to get drinks, maybe appetizers instead of a full course meal. The duck confit was delicious, but I would not go there for steaks. We got filet mignon and it was oversalted and overpriced.",

Our waiter, Juquon, was the best ever. He was extremely knowledgeable on all aspects of the menu and provided excellent drink and food recommendations. The truffle bread, turbot, and rivers were extremely flavorful and delicious. And the entertainment was the icing on the cake! My birthday dinner was amazing and I can't wait to return.",

The beautiful restaurant is perfect for that special occasion or simply a get away to Paris vibe. With the holidays coming up it will be the top notch spot for a Christmas/holiday dinner. The atmosphere, food, cocktails, and wine were amazing and the staff from the chefs, bartenders and servers are meticulous in details and provided a 10 star experience. The entrance has a beautiful display of the steaks and seafood, and the wine room was breathtaking. For cocktails I recommend the La Vie en Rose which was beautifully crafted and the Bison Chaton was tasty as well. All of the appetizers were beyond satisfying, it was hard to choose a favorite. For my main meal, I got the Rib Cap with the potatoes au gratin. The Rib Cap was tender, melted like butter, made exactly to order and the au gratin was a cheesy potato lovers dream. As far as covid concerns ( I noticed someone else's comment above and wanted to set the record straight from personal experience), they were extremely safe and followed all safety procedures, tables spaced out and staff wore masks, gloves and sanitized.  We felt totally safe and comfortable and would highly recommend anyone to go and enjoy this exquisite restaurant. Well done, Monarque for exceeding our experience beyond what we could imagine, we look forward to our next night out soon!",
