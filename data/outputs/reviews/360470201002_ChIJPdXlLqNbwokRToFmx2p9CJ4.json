However this is the worst Nigerian Restaurant I have been to or food I ever ate, the Akara is tasteless & Nonsense, the soup is gabbage. I bought 4 plates of food, pounded yam and Edikaiko soup, puff puff, Akara, 1 star, 1 Orijin beer and liquor, and I paid $110.00. Me and my family got back to our Hotel room and my children refused to eat the food based on it was tasteless, my wife refused to eat her food too. Make matters worst one of the receiptionist a guy, claimed that it is the law that I have to pay a gratuity of 18% which they charged me almost $19.00 and if I didnt pay that he can call the cops on me, I told him to go ahead. Finally when he saw that I was not joking he then said I was joking ooooo, dont play like that with your customers. From the get go I already made up my mind I will tip the lady because she was nice to me and my family, I ended up giving her $15. I will never go back there again If I am ever in New York.  B & B restaurant in East Orange New Jersey is better.",

Given drink tickets by Promoter, ordered Remy with pineapple, handed the ticket only to be told my ticket wouldn't cover the cost and handed a Go Slow drink completely DISGUSTING. Wasn't even given the opportunity to pay the cost difference. Just assume I want white BOTTOM shelf rum and thick guava juice?? Then he complained ther Promoter didn't tell that he was giving complimentary drinks. How is that the patron's issue?? Rather waste the liquor than give it to me for free?

I saw a band set up by the door.  The restaurant is pretty large, there is a yellow mini van in the middle of the restaurant,  probably symbolic of something, but I am not sure what.  Let me first say I am no expert in African food and this was my first experience.  The Joloff (rice) was good, Very SPICY, all the food was very spicy and by spicy I mean HOT.  I had snapper and pounded yam (I did not like the pounded yam, I am pretty sure my disappointment was my own doing, I think I envisioned something else taste and presentation), however the snapper was quite yummy......just be prepared for the fire in your mouth, and your nose to run!! All and all definitely worth it.....I will stress again how spicy the food is, if you can get through it, you may be delighted.",

Decoration was good, but thats not what an African came there to do. Over seasoned or poorly seasoned, the soup tasted so so sooo wrong on many levels. I did not finish my partner's beef that she normally gives to me, yes, read that again, I DIDN NOT FINISH THE BEEF AFTER TASTING IT, on top of that, I didn't crunch the bones of my fish, that's how painful the taste was. I felt like eating salad after eating here as an African man. Serving a cold or lukewarm fufu type meal is a strong no-no. The pounded yam & amala looked like it was prepared earlier in the day, then warmed for us on defrost, we can understand doing that with the stew, but the god damn fufu, haba!! We know the difference between poundi that was just recently prepared with hot water and one that was just warmed, I am not oyinbo. You then provide a huge bowl of unwanted soup with a toddler portion of amala and poundo, so we can request for more. The danfo lookalike van was a good touch to bring you back home and give you that nostalgia feeling. Put effort in your cooking guys, people aren't stupid certainly not those who have years of experience devouring the great Nigerian cuisine. You can't bring someone who you want to convince that Nigerian cuisine is the world's best secret to this place. They will hate it, I didn't think you could hate our cuisine until I came here.",

We were greeted by the bartender who happens to be our server and manager. She seemed like she didn't want to be there, very unfriendly and not welcoming. We ordered 4 different Appetizers, only one of them came before the meal. Three of the menu items we ordered were unavailable and it took the kitchen and the waitress 20minutes to communicate that. Everyone who met us there was served before us. The food temperature was way off and the portion size was disproportionate. Our waitress never came back to check in with us...we ran out of water and it was never refilled. We were forgotten though we sat in the middle \ud83d\ude15. The food wasn't horrible but after such an experience my appetite was back in Delaware. Hence, my satisfaction came from the fried yam and the Danfo.",

The pictures shared were taken before the server cleared our plates, we barely ate anything.  The third person in our party ordered efo riro with snapper and received a snapper and pieces of tilapia!  The moi moi was watery and bland.  The AC never works.  If you want to waste your time and money dine here, but only order white rice with buka sauce. White rice seems to be their specialty.  Our server actually encouraged us to write a review because the owner usually yells at her when she shares feedback from customers.  My last time dining here.",

Bad part was that I was given the wrong order and was asked if I could still keep it. I wanted the thing I ordered but they ran out... so why give me something I didn't order? Tasted and didn't like .. wanted refund and couldn't.. just got a \"discount\". Not sure if I'd recommend, I'd have to go again to see my experience the second time.",

We waited over an hour before we finally received our food. Yes I know you're thinking, but why girl why? I was looking forward to some fried rice with suya. My food was okay but my dates food was a whole different story. Won't get into details, but he opted to proceed with the eating eat than waiting another hour for a replacement plate.

Both were great. Also got the beef stew with egusi sauce, which I  loved!  I am docking one star because, as others have mentioned, the service is insanely slow here (took about 10 minutes to receive our drinks, then there was about 20 minutes in between each course after that). The kitchen also doesn't have much capacity (for example, we were told at the beginning of our meal that the akara we'd ordered was going to take a little longer than expected, which we agreed to...but it didn't show up until after we were finished our entire meal!).  All in all, this place is budget-friendly and a unique experience, but don't go if you're in a hurry!",

This restaurant needs a total makeover and transformation.  Pros: - convenient location -variety of Nigerian meals  Cons - inconsistency in cooking meal fully - inconsistency in cleanliness of restaurant -inconsistency in professionalism  Solution: Maybe if they had competition in the area they would ensure they are preparing the best meal for every customer whatever time of the day or night.",

It is my first time eating Nigerian food and there food was terrible it needed more seasoning and the fufu was bland as hell. The only thing that was good was the jollof rice. The waitress was rude and she gave me a dirty fork and knife and my friends was asking her for a second set and the waiter ignore her. The food took so long to come out too. I ordered jollof rice, fufu, and chicken. My food was hot but it take like thirty minutes to come out. The place was freezing around that time and the waiter said they skip my order the hell. My friend in front of me order a drink and didn\u2019t want it and the waiter the girl who is a thin girl said she couldn\u2019t replace it. Then at the end she charged her for it still. I would of turned up if that was me but the place is mediocore and my stomach hurt when I came home. I am begging people not to visit this restaurant if it is the last place on earth the food is nasty and take too long to serve and if you see this place turn back.  P.S. Don\u2019t visit this restaurant nasty bland food and rude woman waiter.",

The waitress came to our table three times ( order, food, and check). The drinks came with the food and as we asked questions about the menu, she said \" please hurry, you are not the only customers I have\"...FYI there were two occupied tables, the restaurant was practically empty.
