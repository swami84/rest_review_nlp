When the delivery arrived I received a call from the delivery guy to come downstairs. His manager does not allow him to go upstairs. He was very very rude and informed I need to speak to the manager. I called several Times to the store was placed on hold only to be hung up on.  This restaurant is horrible.

I've on multiple occasions received expired salads that were that great. Pizza is usually pretty decent and wings are good but they are pretty stingy with the sauce. Jalapeno cheesey bread is honestly though one of the best things I've ever had.  Update: staff member yelled at me for showing up late even though the app didn't say my pizza was ready. Only after I picked up the pizza did the app update to show it was ready. If delivery wasn't $5 or I lived further than 2 blocks away I would order delivery instead of pick up.",

They\u2019ll take our money but won\u2019t help if we need assistance?  They could have cancelled the order right there and this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. They transfer me to local store nobody picks up. I try THREE times. I have to send an email to which they reply sorry if the account gets hacked it\u2019s my fault. They claim to restore my points that\u2019s the hacker used for free pizza, of course it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Dominos doesn\u2019t care about making things right. Beware!",

I had learned my lesson of not checking my pizza before the delivery guys left. The manager than called me a liar and hung up. I told the driver I needed my money back and he said he couldn't do that. Proceeded to call the store back cursing in English but speaking in Chinese. Then said no and drove away.

Every time I try to order a pizza, it gets messed up. For some reason, the website says I am outside of their delivery zone, even though I'm not (I have gotten pizzas from them before via phone order) so I can't order online.  Once, I tried to call and order. I gave my credit card info and everything. The line went silent after I said 'How long should I be expecting to wait?' I waited for ten minutes on the phone and heard nothing. I assumed it was on it's way. An hour later, no pizza. I called the store and the manager told me 'I never sent your order'. WHY? I have no idea. She didn't even try and call me back. I said 'Well, obviously you have a very unsatisfied customer, who is also very hungry, what can you do to help make this situation right?' After arguing with me for ages about how she couldn't do anything, she agreed to send me free cinnamon sticks with my next order. (What she really needed to do, in my opinion, was send my order out free of charge).  Another time, there was a 50% off deal if you ordered online. I called the store once again to let them know that for some reason, it said I am outside of their delivery zone and it wouldn't let me order online, but I still wanted the 50% off deal (obviously). The manager goes \"well do you want 50% off a pizza, or a full price pizza?\" I said \"50% off, obviously\". she said \"well I can't help you\". UM ARE YOU JOKING?  Ordering a pizza should NOT be this complicated. Just so you know, I have never written a bad review in my life, and I LOVE domino's pizza. The online form for submitting complaints sucks, so at the end of the day, domino's looses my business time and time again, and I am sad and pizza-less.",
