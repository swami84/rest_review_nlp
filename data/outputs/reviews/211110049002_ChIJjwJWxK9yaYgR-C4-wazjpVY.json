After reading so many great reviews about the igloos that make it sound like a winter wonderland experience, I've got to say that I am shocked there is one at all after what my group went through tonight. It got to the point that we honestly believed Ashton Kutcher was about to come out and tell us we were being punked, the entire thing would have made more sense if it has been an episode of the show. The Igloos say they seat 8, but we only had 6 chairs for our party of 8. And the heater was cute but did not do a single thing, and I was seated right next to it. The igloo had holes in it and the zipper was ripped open with a failed attempt at repairing it with scotch tape. It took a while before our server (who really was very nice) showed up for the first time, which he said nobody told him we were out there so I accepted that no problem. But it took forever to see him or receive any of our drinks to start. It was not busy at all either. Then the limited menu consists of pizza, or you can get food they say feeds 6 but certainly does not (also, one of the serves 6 items is just a whole fried pig head). We received drinks we did not order at random times and then just didn't receive the ones we asked for, or they would just come much later. They brought out the tomahawk steak with just a bunch of knives and no forks, then 30 mins later they brought out forks. At the end, I asked for a box to take my pizza home in and I was given a box with gnawed on pizza crusts and old food inside of it. The entire experience was truly a wild ride. And not worth the money at all.",

We got things all at the wrong times, got drinks we didn't ask for but got the drinks we asked for way late. Got the tomahawk steak as a shareable, it definitely can not feed 6 people as advertised unless you each want 1 piece of steak and like 3 dry potatoes per person. It was a fun night but incredibly overpriced. The igloo itself had holes in it, zipper was broken, scotch tape all up the sides of the entrance, and water was getting inside since it was raining. The igloo said it could fit 8 people, but ours only had 6 seats, so we had couples sharing a chair. It was the red Vegas themed one. 100% not worth the money, unless you have money to burn.  Edit because I forgot: we asked for pizza boxes for food to go and there was somebody else's leftovers in one of them.",

We got there and were greeted by a cheaply put together \"Las Vegas\" themed globe with Dollar Tree dice and some large playing cards. Ok... We came last year and the themes were on point and looked like actual effort was put into it. Not only was the theme this year bad, our tent was apparently the only tent that didn't have a HEATER. We were literally on a rooftop in December in 30 degree weather with no heater about to pay a minimum of $400 on food and drinks. Wow. When we thought we would be able to warm up with the food we ordered, that was not the case. The $10 french fries came out cold for our entire group. We sent all 3 back. They came back cold AGAIN. One of us got the truffle fries which was $18 and it was cold as well and had no truffle on it. It looked like they grated some portabella mushrooms on top of it. Drinks we ordered never showed up, food we didn't order showed up randomly. An absolute mess of an experience and all around terrible. I'll NEVER be back here again. Take your money elsewhere, this place can shut down for all I care.",

        "caption": "Made a 5:00 pm reservation, outdoor seating, party of four. Planned for 90 minutes of drinks and appetizers before having dinner at The Brown Hotel. I called after making the reservation and inquired about being seated by a heater. I was told to request this upon arrival, that it shouldn't be a problem given our early reservation (they open at 5:00 pm).  Arrived at 5:06 pm, hostess was on the phone. We stood there for 10+ minutes along with another man waiting to be served, while multiple staff and management stood around with no one acknowledging our existence. It wasn't that they were busy, there were only two other customers in the entire place, already seated at the outside bar.  When the Hostess got off the phone, she gave no acknowledgement of our waiting. I provided my name and asked for seats by the heaters. The outside deck has two large fire pits, which each seat 14 people and I believe another smaller seating area near a fire pit.  They were all empty.  The Hostess then walked us out and attempted to seat us at a table nowhere near a fire pit AND in chairs that each had a pool of water in them from rain the previous day. We pointed out the water in the chairs and I again requested to be seated by the fire pits, clarifying that we have my 85 year-old mother-in-law with us.  The Hostess indicated she would have to check with the Manager. Again, the entire place was almost completely empty!  The Hostess went back inside and as she was talking to a Manager, I walked up and again asked to be seated by the heaters. I again explained that I had an elderly woman with us, and that we now were only going to be there for drinks and appetizers, that the space would be freed up in less than an hour.  The Manager said it would be no problem.  The Hostess walked us back outside and took us to the far fire pit, only for us to find that again, the chairs mostly had pools of water in them.  She literally just stood there watching as my son went around the table, trying to cobble together four dry chairs (he found one) for us to sit in.  Then the music came on and it was apparent she was trying to seat us immediately adjacent to the speakers, which were very loud, especially given the fact that there were only three customers in the entire place.  We would not have been able to hear each other.  The Hostess was clueless during this entire time, she made no attempt to dump the the standing water out of the chairs or to take any steps dry them after we dumped them.  Literally every other seating option available to her would have been more appropriate than what she offered us and she just stood there, mouth agape, when she encountered problems.  And what kind of restaurant opens without doing a basic walk-around to ensure the premises are ready for customers. It had rained the day before but the day of our reservation was sunny and dry, albeit cool, all day. There is no excuse for trying to seat customers in an inch of standing water, not once, but twice. And never an apology, any decent staff would have been horrified.  We left. After patronizing 8-Up many times in the past, we will not be returning.",

This review is not that review.  I\u2019d wanted to eat here for some time, so I made reservations weeks ago for our anniversary dinner. It\u2019s our first anniversary and Covid made for a weird year and I felt like having a nice dinner with my husband. It was anything but.  Despite having a reservation that was confirmed through Open Table, we were treated like they\u2019d never heard of us. I had written in the notes area that it was for our anniversary, but I\u2019m certain that was never seen. Then, they sat us at a high top table with weird wooden bar stool type chairs that were awkward and uncomfortable. It was 35 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. We spent the last 10 minutes of that deciding on a different place to eat.  The drinks we ordered didn\u2019t look anything like they were supposed to, but they were strong AF so that\u2019s nice. Our waiter informed us that they didn\u2019t have a bartender, clearly to apologize for the terrible service we received thus far. We finally got our check after asking three different staff members to let our server know, and we left. The manager told us to have a nice night, not seeming to realize that we left before we ever possibly have had an entire meal. The whole experience took just under an hour.  The views are rad, but it really seems like they have approximately four people running an entire restaurant. One of them is only there to wear a suit and stare into the distance. One is there to decorate the igloos. One is there to stand behind the bar and take the orders of everyone but us. So that leaves 1 dude running the show, making his own drinks and I guess cooking the food for his tables? That is so unfair and likely unpleasant for all of them- clearly this is grossly mismanaged. Perhaps the nice suit manager dude could be utilized to do conceivably anything else and this might have gone more smoothly for them.",

For as much as you pay, there shouldn't be a 30 minute wait for a drink. I explained this, and instead of trying to rectify the situation, he simply said sorry and walked away.",

We waited 35 minutes until I went up to the bar and got us drinks. I then spoke to one of the managers and told him what was going on and he said someone will be right over, we waited 20 more minutes and nobody came over to help us. I then found a different manager and told her that we had been there for about an hour at that point and had yet to be served or assigned a waiter. She sent over a waiter within 10 minutes to serve us. They were out of the pizza and crabcakes that we had wanted. We eventually settled on meatballs, a couple salads and the spinach artichoke dip. The dip was very bland, it could've been from a jar. The salads were decent in taste but a bit small. The meatballs were not good and my mother was sick night. Overall the experience completely turned me off from this restaurant. I'm not one to expect anything when I have poor service but I thought maybe a round of drinks would be comped, but we were not given anything. On our way out the host said his name was Nick and to please let him know next time we visit so they can comp us a round of drinks. Unfortunately our first visit was so horrible I will never be returning.",

I ran back after I paid to get the itemized check since we were a large group and I needed to figure out how to split the bill only to find out when I got home that tip had already been included in the total. I feel like it was either a big mistake or she may have been trying to do this to get more in tips by not giving me the right receipt (essentially giving her over a 40% tip on a 6 person check). I called the restaurant to see what could be done and left a message given there was no answer and have not heard anything back in 2 weeks...be careful if you're going in a group!",

        "caption": "Honestly, one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  The only bright spot was the waitress.  We booked one of the igloos for a friends birthday which has a $500 minimum.  We were led to believe that the igloo would be an appropriate option for eating a full meal.  It is most certainly not for anyone thinking of doing that.  Do not book an igloo unless you only plan on doing drinks and appetizers unless you want to eat your $40 steak out of your lap like a family picnic at the park.  The main heater in our igloo was supposedly broken and when we asked to speak with a manager about our situation he informed us that the heater had been broken for a couple of weeks.  Well, if you're a restaurant that charges a $500 minimum for an \"experience\" like this there is no excuse not to march someone down to Walmart or Lowes and buy a new heater for that tent the second that the heater breaks.  It also turns out that the heater wasn't broken, it was merely unplugged.  We were also told that there would be blankets in our igloo to which we were informed they are only available on request.  Call me crazy but when the temperature is under 30 degrees maybe you should have those blankets already in the igloo waiting for your customers.  When we called for a manager he was incredibly defensive during our entire conversation.  He never said, \"I'm sorry this isn't what you thought it would be.  How can we make it right?\".  Instead, all he could say was that it wasn't an ideal situation for a full meal, but they thought it was best not to limit the menu options even though there was literally only a small coffee table in the igloo to set food on for 8 people.  He told us that their original idea for the concept was cocktails and apps, but he could show us hundreds of receipts where people had eaten full meals in the igloos.  Well, if that manager reads this I really don't care about the hundreds of people that have eaten out there.  Those people that chose to eat a full course meal out of their laps have nothing to do with our situation.  Your jobs as a restaurant manager, or a manager in in business for that matter, is to find a solution for a problem without creating more conflict.  It's not to tell the customer in front of you that you've never had that problem (which you clearly have if you read your Google reviews), and that it's basically our fault that we were misled by your staff when booking the igloo.  To top it off after our initial conversation you could tell he was frustrated with us and when he left the tent he aggressively zipped the tent down about half way leaving it half open so that the 30 degree weather could get into the tent.  We did end up going inside to eat so that we didn't have to eat out of our laps.  We were a party of 8 and half of our food came out and then it took another 20 minutes before the other 4 people's food came out.  The first 4 were almost finished eating before the second 4 got their food.  when we asked why it took so long their explanation was that their food was \"made to order\" so it can take extra time to get the food out for one party.  Isn't all restaurant food made to order?  The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because our waitress was very good and accommodating.  I'd strongly recommend you take your dining dollars elsewhere.",

He answered all of our questions and made sure that everything was good for us. Only some of the food was good. The crab Mac and cheese was good, but you could barely taste the crab, the rabbit was great, the hot brown is not made like the traditional hot brown, and the chicken was great while the rice was subpar. If you go here for the first time, and don\u2019t have an expensive/ experienced palate, I would suggest to just stuck to what you know and get a salad or burger and fries.",

The manager didn\u2019t deescalate well when we voiced our concerns. We asked the manager about the blankets that were supposed to be in the igloo and he said that the blankets are only given upon request. He said \u201cideal\u201d 9 times when there was noting \u201cideal\u201d about our current situation. Then we requested to be moved indoors for dinner and we weren\u2019t given a refund on the igloo. During dinner half our table didn\u2019t get their food until the other half had already eaten. Worst restaurant experience we have had in a very long time. It is a cute concept but managed poorly. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because our server was sweet and on top of things.",

On the Thursday prior to my requested reservation date, McKenna called and said there was no availability until February. I made a reservation for the 9th. Less than a week later, McKenna called and said the time slot I requested was overbooked and asked me to switch times. I said no thank you.

The price tag may seem expensive.. but it\u2019s the best bang for your buck. You get all different kinds of mixers, OJ/Soda/Cranberry/RedBull etc. split between a group-it breaks down cheaper than getting a couple drinks anyways. We got a couple pizzas the kale dip\u2014and pork rinds which are an awesome combination. OH! I have to give a shout out to or server Matthew.

I do recommend waiting until the weather is cold to get the full effects of the snow globe and make sure you request one with a table. Our snow globe did not have a table and it was difficult to eat dinner. Although our server did a good job, we were rushed out by I assume the owner or acting manager at 7:00 sharp even though it took a long time to order and get our bill. We literally received the bill seconds before he tried to rush us out. That's the reason for three stars",

The service was awful, so bad that our waitress showed up every 30 minutes with at least 3 excuses. Our \u201cupdated\u201d reservation was at 8:15, so we were only given the bar menu because the kitchen \u201cclosed \u201c at 9, and we were  required to spend $400 on the bar food menu??!!!  The drinks were VERY SLOW to arrive. One drink was beyond gross, it was smoked and tasted like chimney water. Other menu items weren\u2019t available.  Do not let the pictures fool you. There was no snow because no one wanted to run the machine, as we were told by our waitress. We were also told the one desert item and all IPA beers were sold out. One of the worst restaurant experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Poorly managed is an understatement!!!",

Our server was new, but she was SO on top of it! The igloo was nice, but just be aware that even though it has a heater, the server will have to open it to come in and out many times. So it didn't stay truly warm inside. They do have some blankets, but you may want to bring your own if everyone wants one. While the website says they're intended for 8-10 people, we had 8 and it would've been a little too tight with an additional 2 people. There was not much table space. It's more like a coffee table with some end tables. Unfortunately we were there on a rainy night, so we were not able to enjoy the outside fires and stuff. We only stayed in our igloo. That was still enjoyable all on its own, but I think having those extra perks on the rooftop would've added to the experience.",

The portion sizes are generous and every single dish was perfectly made. My husband raved about the short rib which I also found to be delicious. I had the turkey and sorry grandma it was the best turkey I have ever had! Moist and flavorful.  Priced extremely reasonable given the quality and quantity of food.  Thank you 8up and thank you chef for an unforgettable Thanksgiving. Top notch service, Savannah was a delight",

There is a large indoor restaurant and then a fantastic outdoors roof terrace with a bar as its focal point and lots of seating available, both lounge style and bar stool/elevated table style.  The staff are friendly, service is swift and the cocktails on offer are excellent. Food on offer is good. We opted for some bar-food. The chicken wings were delicious. A great place to finish up a night on the town.",

Racist staff, substandard drinks served by unfriendly and boorish bartenders who seem to have a problem hearing and responding promptly, a bar manager who believes solving problems with customer complaints (e.g. that a drink tastes bad and was poorly made) is to offer free drinks and a general manager who thinks it's OK and without consequence to call the police and spew lies about patrons in order to justify having them removed from the premises. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Their conduct is rather unfortunate but will most definitely be addressed. Just skip this place if you are a minority expecting to be treated properly at a venue even if while you are patronizing the establishment there are matters that need to be course corrected. Otherwise sip your drink and don't say a word.",

My new your strip was supposed to be medium rare,  but came out very rare. I ate the ends of it that was a little fatty and the waiter never checked back with us until everyone else was done. He asked me if I wanted to put it back on the grill and I said no, he then grabbed it from the table and said he would take it off my bill. I was planning on taking it home. Even after taking it off my bill, It was still over $100 for my wife's appetizer, entree and 3 glasses of wine. Way overpriced. Service was not up to par and there's a lot of other places with better service, food and atmosphere.",

There is an indoor dining area with bar as well as an outdoor bar with ample seating. The drinks were made with overflowing shots and the bartenders were fast and efficient even with the large crowd. But what makes this 5 star is the view of the surrounding Louisville area. You can see in 360 degrees, replete with 'copters landing on nearby rooftops, dropping off their guests. A glass wall surrounds the outdoor area providing protection from the high winds on the 8th floor. It gets it's name from the fact it's on the 8th floor rooftop of the building. There are also gas firepits that added the perfect amount of ambiance. Not much dancing except by me. :)",

However, my wife and I sat for quite a while at the bar before getting any attention, then when I ordered my cocktail, the bartender made it and poured an ounce or two from the mixing cup in a glass and handed it to a couple girls he was chatting with, I'm guessing to impress them, and chatted a bit more before finally serving my drink. He continued this behavior of socializing while postponing service until we got fed up and left while waiting to order more... Unless you showed up in a suit and tie, then he gave them IMMEDIATE attention... I'll even look past the 4oz wine pour he gave my wife as if we we're classy enough to recognize a proper pour.",

They were switching their drink menu, so were out of two of the drinks I would have rather had (Color Pop & something with pear). I'm glad I ended up with what I did though. The flavors were perfect together-sweet with a little bit of bite. Once our reservation time came, we moved over into the dining area. Nice views and excellent service. Don't let the unclothed tables fool you, this meal felt very upscale. The decor was beautiful without being over the top. Chain curtains let the light through, but still showed thought in the ambiance created. We shared several share plates and small plates (hush puppies, monkey bread, brussel sprouts, beer cheese pierogi, ravioli, wood fired octopus). I didn't have the octopus, but was told it was great. Of all of these, the pierogi and brussel sprouts were my favorites. The crispness of the outer layers of bussel sprouts was to die for. Maybe because it was my first time having smoked honey, but tasting it on the monkey bread was a wonderful symphony of flavors. We also shared a lovely bottle of a sparkling wine - rose from Austria, but I don't recall the name of it. I wish I could remember, bc it may be my new favorite. All-in-all, I am so happy with everything here. Although the rooftop was under construction (they were working on it on a Saturday evening, so I'm sure they are dedicated to getting it open as quickly as possible), I don't feel like I had anything short of a fantastic experience here. Can't wait to go back again!",
