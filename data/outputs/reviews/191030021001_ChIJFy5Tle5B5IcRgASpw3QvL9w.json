The food isn't too expensive but there are a few items that are expensive. There are very expensive drinks as well which I was surprised with by the bill. I think a waiter should tell somebody the price before they actually pour the drink if it seems like they don't know what they're talking about. It's just professionalism. There is a big screen to watch games or whatever's on but overall it's a 5 star restaurant venue that has expensive liqours and professionally cooked food. If you have a taste for expensive liquor than this is a good place.",

With the attached parking garage you don't even need to get out in the rain or snow. There are lots of chef-quality dishes on the menu, some being complete surprises. A case in point is the deceptively simple bruschetta appetizer, which is normally a boring dish with diced tomatoes. The Vue's version is the best I have ever had. They use sliced artisan baguette with melted mozzarella, sliced and roasted tomatoes with balsamic drizzle, all on a bed of baby greens. Delicious. One server said that dish is the reason she wanted to work at the restaurant in the first place. I think the one menu hiccup is the bread you can order. Surprisingly it's not artisan bread, so I believe it's below the standard of quality on the rest of the menu. I suggest having a generous portion of really good French or Italian bread with some great butter. This is what other fine restaurants do. Fortunately most all the other menu items are outstanding. All in all, it's one of the best Iowa City restaurants. I think you'll like it.",

A small disappointment I had is, I reserved a table 3 weeks early, requesting to have a table near the window for a nice view for this occasion, but was unable to get one despite the early reservation. I understand the table arrangement/reservation might be a little tricky with the social-distancing in place, but well, it is still a little disappointing. However, later in the night as more customers are leaving, we requested to be moved to the patio area, and they DID move us, so at least we get to enjoy our dessert with a nice view!  As for the food, I ordered a medium-rare Filet Mignon and that is definitely the BEST Filet Mignon I've had before. 200% recommend it.",

I have been there time and time again since their opening, and I am pleased every time (my one critique is that the crostini is almost always too hard, unpleasant to chew). Aside from that, though, the atmosphere is stunning. Our service is always spectacular. Though Friday and Saturday nights often have longer wait times for food, that is to be expected of ANY restaurant on those days, and the servers always make sure to check in on us in the meantime, both refilling waters and asking if we need more drinks, so they handle the situations very well!

However, I was just there last weekend and ordered something from their menu, and when I finally got it, turns out what I ordered is not what I received because of a typo. It wouldn't have been a big issue if I had been told it was a typo when I placed my order.  So FYI, if you think about ordering their BEEF salad, it's actually a BEET salad. And if you like beets, I recommend that salad; it was tasty.",

I tried to order light and ordered the walleye with quinoa and it came drenched in a bed of cream. I couldn't eat it because I don't typically eat such rich foods and almost immediately felt sick from the richness. The server and manager noticed that I wasn't really eating and kindly comped me a $5 side salad that was honestly amazing and way, way better than either of the $25-30 entrees. I give the food a 2 and the service and the management a 5 of 5. Atmosphere is weird and is a 2- lots of high school kids there for a dance, lots of much older people and a few couples, large tvs like a sports bar instead of a rooftop fine dining restaurant. The server and management made the experience okay because they were so great, but I'm disappointed in my choice of restaurant for our 5th anniversary. We would not go back.",

I ordered \u201cThe Vue Burger\u201d and changed a few things.. provolone instead of cheddar, no big deal right (they didn\u2019t have it.) They let my sister order a flatbread and didn\u2019t have any (Who\u2019s running the kitchen?...) so she opted for Mac and Cheese.  The staff were poorly trained, seemed most were in their first week. Fumbling around with menus and dropping cups as well as other things. It was often I saw most the staff in the kitchen which baffles me as to why they don\u2019t know what they have in stock. I\u2019m no Gordon Ramsey... but sheesh this place needs to be an appetizer and drink place only, to go with the Great view of downtown Iowa City.",

The seating and decor is terrifically appointed and I have a lot of respect that they showed restraint for putting giant tv's everywhere. The place LOOKs, posh, stylish, high end. But a dining experience is a whole lot more than a joint that looks like they hired a solid interior decorator. That's why Leaf Kitchen is one of the best dining experiences in the area hands down.  The food is a little bit basic for the venue. It kind of looks like they just made some adjustments to the Black Stone or Stella's menu. Maybe it's the same people that own it? I like those establishments a LOT for upscale neighborhood restaurants. I rate those places as 4-5 star any day because what they are is what they propose themselves to be. Whereas the Vue could be so much more. The area has a lot of upscale eateries but very few that have executive chefs that stake their restaurant on an inspiring concept, or an inventive style like the top flight places like you see in NYC or Chicago. That is an gap to fill and Vue has the opportunity and venue to do it!  Last and perhaps most importantly, their waiters are real green horn novices. I mean we encountered 3-4 servers in our short visit there and none of them knew a significant amount about the menu, or the food, or their drink menu. Really disappointing. I also think uniformed waiters with name badges is an incredibly tacky way to staff a venue like this. Get at least a couple of great people with experience, give them some dress guidelines and let them make serving an experience with their own style, their own charm, and customers will appreciate the expertise and authenticity.  I hope the owner of this joint will read this and take my input to heart as a constructive critique. And I hope anyone who reads this will go and try for yourself. Maybe I'm being over critical, but I wanted this place to be more. I'll be back again a few times I'm sure. I'd love to revise my review.",

Flatbread was just a giant chunk of melted fresh mozzarella and crust, pasta was kinda bland, and apps weren't too impressive either. I didn't even take my leftovers home. View and service were good though. I've seen gimmicky places like this pop up in big cities where you pay for location. Didn't think I'd see one show up in IC for a while, but here we are. I'll go back and give it another shot, but wasn't impressed overall with my first visit.",
