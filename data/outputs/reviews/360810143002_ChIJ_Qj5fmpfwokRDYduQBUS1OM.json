He even waits on you (tells you the specials, brings drinks/food) - he is definitely a man of many talents. On top of that, he\u2019s really sweet and he really cares that you enjoy the food and experience. Think like a mom & pop kind of shop - something really rare to get in NYC. The only thing you have to do is wait a bit for meals to come out cause he really cares that they\u2019re fresh.  I recommend getting some appetizers while you wait for the main dishes to come out. We ordered Sahara Mix, Mombar (Appetizers) lamb tagine, and dejaj fel-foron (Mains). We wiped our plates clean. Unique taste. Really fresh. Can\u2019t recommend this place enough!",

We peeked our heads in and saw a cozy, ecclectically designed restaurant that made us feel like we were no longer a handful of blocks from home, but traveling to a distant land where all the troubles of life no longer matter. It was a slow night for the restaurant, which made our visit that much more special. The owner was very friendly and welcoming and recommended the perfect dishes for us to try. My fiance got the lamb shank while I opted for the sea bass. Our meals were fantastic - perfect blends of spices, tender meats falling off the bones, variety of carefully seasoned vegetables served with heaps of rice and couscous. For two people who weren't even planning on getting dinner, we finished every last bite on our plates and then relaxed with a hot cup of mint tea while discussing everything from family lineage to the state of the world with our gracious host. This is not a typical NYC restaurant. It's warm and unpretentious, the owner welcomes you like family, and the food tastes like grandma has been up since daybreak preparing it. Unbeknownst to me, Mombar has been there for 18 years and I can't believe it was my first visit. It definitely won't be my last.",

The food all tastes like it is made with love. On my most recent trip I had the Egyptian lamb chops and the warm artichoke salad. Both were spectacular in flavor and preparation.   Tip: don't go here if you are in a hurry as the service is run at a very relaxed pace. Also this place is BYOB so bring a bottle of wine with you if you like!",

We went with the chef's special where the chef cooks you whatever he likes - giving you a heads up of whats to come when you place your order.  Started off with the usual mezze of babaganoush (eggplant), fool (fava beans) and hummus (chickpeas) with pita bread.  Next, we were served with four courses ranging from fish tajeen with couscous to lamb cheeks in a sauce to liver.  Definitely worth a try if you are an adventurous meat eater.",
