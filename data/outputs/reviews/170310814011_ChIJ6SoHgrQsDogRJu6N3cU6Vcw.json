I went this Monday December the 9th and he pulled two names, comics who I've seen just about every Monday I've been there, out of what was supposed to be a \"random\" drawing. By 2 names I mean 2 names out of one egg holding names of \"guests\" who signed up for a chance to be called up to perform. Why not call it what it is and say \"After we called up the comics with reserved spots, we'll pull one or 2 names at random for real. If we have time\".Every other comic called up that night were also comics I've seen any other time I went on open mic night. I've been there a couple of times because I thought it would be fun to get on stage and tell a few jokes. The joke was that I actually thought open mic meant I had a chance of being picked to perform. It wouldn't be as bad if they at least made sure the comics didn't have the same material they used for the entire month. Aside from that, they usually have pretty good comics and the pizza's not bad. Also, most nights the service is pretty good. It would be nice if they didn't use false advertising, but you get what you pay for I guess. Monday's are only 10 bucks a head usually, just don't expect a chance to get on stage unless you know the guy running the show.",

I was actually thinking of going to see a comedian (Ali Wong) at the Chicago Theatre, but ultimately decided to come here instead. I am SO glad I did because the comedians were so funny! We even went to the free stand up on the first floor afterwards & it made the night even better.  Me and my fianc\u00e9 both ordered salads, and they were so good! I know most people would come here because of the deep dish pizza from Gino's East but I am so glad I got their caprese pasta salad. It was so good :)  If I lived in Chicago, I would definitely come back here often. If you're a tourist, I'd highly recommend coming here for a fun night out!",

The waitress was taking our order, a question was asked about how was one of the food items was prepared the waitress said that she did not know and she was going to find out when she walked away she began waiting on other tables and she did not finish taking our order. The manager came over and took our order and he paid for our appetizer and drinks. We ordered a pizza it was brought to us when the show was almost over so we were being rushed to leave because there was another show. But the waitress would not come to our table so we had to ask another waiter to bring a to go box. By the way she brought the bill. The comedians was funny; The waitress made the experience less than desirable I would not recommend this business because of the waitress behavior it really dampened the mood. I gave her tip to the waiter that helped us. The waitress never told us her name. I don't think that I will ever go back, There are other comedy clubs in Chicago.",

I do not proclaim to be an expert, but my wife and I do attend stand up comedy frequently whether it be in Vegas, Chicago, New York, or a few clubs in our local area.  When purchasing tickets you have the opportunity to purchase a general admission ticket or a VIP ticket that states \"Attendance to the show including priority reserved seating in the first two rows of tables, closest to the stage.\"  We decided to pay the extra $10 each to sit closer.  The staff made a mocking comment in good humor when we arrived that we are VIP's, which I can appreciate as it is a comedy club and you are looking to establish a rapport and start a good experience for the guest.  Unfortunately, that is where the humor stopped.  We were brought into the club and sat in the fourth row at a table, one of the back areas just shy of the bar.  There were 3 open tables right in front of the stage in which my wife asked me to inquire why we weren't seated there.  When I got up and asked the staff, I received the reply \"we had a lot of VIP's book tonight.\"  When I pointed out the three tables that were open I was told \"those are reserved.\"  I do not expect to be treated like royalty, I am a normal guy in the middle class, but it is apparent that there is priority seating if there is further incentive either monetarily or by knowing someone in this club, as these tables were filled just before the show with people of a much higher clientele.  As I stated, they probably did pay more for their seating arrangement, but it is disappointing when you spend extra money to be seated closer and then get pushed to the back.  As for the comedy, I felt the comedians did great on the night of 6.8.19 but the crowd was terribly uptight and unresponsive which made the show feel awkward.  Again, great job by the comedians, everything else unfortunately resulted in a lackluster experience.  We will be looking elsewhere for our future stand up comedy.",

One member of our party ran up finally to see if we could get our drinks and one of the bartenders shrugged him off. We FINALLY got our first round of two drinks five minutes before the show started. The waitress came quickly to get our drinks and we didn\u2019t even have a moment to place an order for more. By that time the WHOLE SHOW was about over anyway. So, kind of ridiculous.

I really felt sorry for them. Our poor waitress had a hard time as well. We ordered together and only had 1 drink delivered to us. We waited a very long time for the second drink.

The waitress was no help at all in the beer selection process and at one point in time I ended up with a wrong beer. We ordered calamari to snack on during the show. We figured it was safe to order calamari and we were wrong. It showed up very fast, lukewarm, and it was serve with cold marinara sauce (I think it was marinara) All we got was a plate of calamari, no napkins, no small plates and no utensils. The comics we saw that night were funny and overall got us laughing. We will be back for the comedy but we will eat and drink somewher So to sum it up; - funny group of comics. - clueless waitress. - terrible food. - mediocre beer selection.",

They had various topics they had to tell jokes about for time periods and audience applause determined winner. One guy on one team was funny, other 3 people were not. Had a few laughs over 20 minutes. Next up until close was an hour or 1.5 of amateurs doing 2-3 minute bits, with about 3-4 regular comics at that club (professional? Semi?) In between. About 2 of maybe 10 amateurs were genuinely funny, some just got crickets. One guy we couldn't even understand. Professionals were a bit better. Almost all the bits from everyone that night were very very crude , about sex, and tons of cursing  One drunk guy at the bar behind the audience starting talking to someone real loudly the last half hour which was really distracting, and none of the employees did anything about it. Finally, I had 2 mixed drinks (gin and tonic) that were $12 each and I've never tasted such terrible gin my whole life. Might have been floor cleaner and not gin! Overall, if you are visiting Chicago and only have limited opportunities to do things while you are there, pay the money to go see a professional comic.",

However on the night I went which was a Saturday, the pickings for comedians were pretty slim. It felt more like an open mic night than polished comedians. So I found that rather disappointing.

I\u2019m not going to get into everything other then that our server forgot to put in our pizza that we had ordered. 30 mins later, after 3 tables in front of us got their deep dish pizzas, I had asked where our pizza was? (Thin cheese pizza) she replied with \u201cpizza?\u201d So I said \u201cyes the pizza we ordered 30 minutes ago\u201d and she said she\u2019ll check. 4 minutes later comes back and says \u201cI forgot to put in your pizza, what was on it?\u201d I looked at her dumbfounded, turned to my family and said she forgot to put it in, do we still want it. They said no so i relaid the answer and got a \u201coh, ok\u201d in response before she walked away. No I\u2019m sorry I forgot or anything. Just \u201coh,ok\u201d. Worst service ever! Not because she forgot, I\u2019m a bartender and I would never leave a table like that, especially after I was the one whom messed up! And on top of that, after she walked away, my 85 year old grandmother asked why the pizza wasn\u2019t coming and while we were telling her, management came over and told us to stop talking during the show... I\u2019m sure not knowing what had just happened due to their server, we had explained and wasn\u2019t given an apology either. At the end of the night, a man was waiting for us in the hallway to talk to us, not that I gave him much of a chance to speek, but I told him I don\u2019t blame the establishment but the server. Which is true. But they weren\u2019t busy, had maybe 20 tables total. Not my best experience out!!!....  ****New update... I received a reply for this review and was asked to email the establishment to get this rectified, so I email just that. I was asked what happened, I replied with \u201cjust what I said in the review you replied to\u201d and I repeated the review. Never received another email, what was that about? Just wanted to look good on google?",
