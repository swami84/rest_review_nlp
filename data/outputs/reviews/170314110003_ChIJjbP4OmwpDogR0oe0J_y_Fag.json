I even LOVE the fact that you can purchase a meal for someone else. Like I'll pay for my meal and pay for another meal for whomever comes in hungry or come short on their order. I think that's super dope. Lastly they have a wall you can write on with chalk and leave a remark.

Firstly, my food took 20 minutes for a steak bowl. I get all the way home to see that I had no meat in my bowl. Horrible. I called the restaurant to let them know, but no one answered the phone. I called several times within 30 minutes. I chalked that up as a loss. Yesterday I had out of town guests that are vegetarian so I took them to Lighthouse because it's a close healthy option that serves vegan and veggie options. Why not give them a second chance? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f This time I ordered a steak quesadilla. Can't possibly mess that up right?! Not only did my guest and I wait 20 minutes for our food but my quesadilla had absolutely no CHEESE OR MEAT! I kindly go up to explain that this happened to me last time and ask for them to make it again. The cook which was the standing manager was very rude and acted like I was a bother. I waited 30 minutes for another quesadilla. My guests were done eating. I went up to the counter to see what was the probl and they said that my food was coming up. I waited 5 more minutes. Asked for my money back but they had brought the food as soon as I was asking for my money. I asked if I could get the food since I was leaving and the \"manager\"said that they don't do that. I kindly took my money and left. Poor customer service. I will never go to this restaurant again!",

For starters, although we were the only ones in line, we had to wait awhile without any acknowledgement of staff before placing our order. Upon placing our order for the Mango Salmon bowl, we were told that the price is $12.99 and 55 cents extra for brown rice. However, the menu on the two overhead flat screens it is listed at $10.99 with your choice of rice or pasta. In addition, we were told that the new price is affixed to a small sign on the counter glass and the new price hasn\u2019t been updated on the flat screens.  At this point we decided to have lunch somewhere else. First off, as a new restaurant that\u2019s Black Owned, the customer service should\u2019ve been considerably better instead of constantly addressing your cute little kid that\u2019s behind the counter. Secondly, please update your menu prices on all publications instead of having your customers look at a small sign that has a line going through the old price and has the new price written with a Sharpie... Really!?!? Finally, why raise the price of the Mango Salmon by $2 and charge extra for rice? After all the salmon (wo mango) & rice is $10.99. I hear the food is tasty. However, I won\u2019t be in a hurry to visit anytime soon...We\u2019ve got to do better!",

The rude cashier said it would be 5 mins, 15 mins later I asked for an accurate ETA of my food. He immediately got agitated and said 5 mins. I said you said that 15 mins ago. He said ok well we just had a rush so we will get to you when we do. Never apologized for the delay. I'll take my money over to Ain't She Sweet Cafe (similar menu nearby)",

What was really messed up was that he pretended to take my order, and then tell me he didn't because he was taking multiple orders at the same time. I still went ahead despite my reservations and my food was nowhere near being made. I drove 20 mins to get there because my friend wanted their food. By the time I got back home an we started eating, the tofu was bad and undercooked so that my friend couldn't eat it. Now everything else was good, but I wanted a refund for that. I left a message and still no one has ever called or apologized for this. Needless to say we'll never be back. What a shame.",

The All-American wrap with All-American sauce was really good - a good price for a good amount of food. Food took a while to make, but it's because the meat is made to order. We were the only ones in line so we didn't wait long. I can see how if there was a long line or if they had a lot of call in orders, it could take a while for the food to come up. But it's really solid food for a good price - worth the wait. And the locally made cookies - Cookies with Curves - were amazing. I definitely recommend this place. Good non-meat options for folks.

The employee only gave me a few chips and it looked like she was picking through them (I thought she was picking the non broken ones), so I asked for more and she gave me an excuse about how the container wouldn't close, but their were literally about 10 chips. Again, I asked for more and she obliged. I get home and half the chips are stale and greasy. This place was way better on 53rd. The employees cared and were nice and the overall quality was great.",

However, what bothered me more was how he sarcastically rushed me off the phone due to having a \u201cline\u201d in the store, putting on a fake \u201cquality assurance customer service\u201d voice as he said, \u201cplease order from us again.\u201d  He didn\u2019t ask to put me on hold to get someone else to check on the possible ingredient, he didn\u2019t know if I or someone it was ordered for was allergic, or if there could have been a mix up with the quesadilla (since he assumed I was a Carlos who had ordered the same thing from the same online service).  Again, I love Lighthouse, but this experience rubbed me the wrong way. Can we get the young man who worked Saturday night at 8PM on Dec. 22 2018 to learn what\u2019s in Veggie Crumble please.

        "caption": "Let me just say there is a lot of good that litehouse does to feed those in need....and the owner I've met before seems to be a really a great guy! Unfortunately, the staff really needs a bit more customer service training. Today, I ran over to Litehouse Grill before they closed on A Friday night to get the mango grilled salmon bowl. Two orders to be exact. I also ordered a lemonade and 2 orders of sweet potato fries. (approximately $37.00). I get home and there is NO salmon in one of the orders. One order of fries is hot and the other is not. I noticed that as the person was putting together my food, she was half paying attention, and of course the customer service was mediocre (just as I remembered when they were on 53rd street). The rice in the bowls-- hard and cold. This is the second time I visited since they moved to 55th street. Then it all came back today, the reason I stopped going in the first place. The mistakes that have always been made with my food and the mediocre customer service. I've gone to other food establishments for years, and have gotten a wrong order far less than I have at Litehouse. I have eaten there so many times and have continued to support the business, but the staff just can't seem to get it right. I get it....this is just another review, and life goes on, and they will keep making money, but I keep trying and I keep getting disappointed. I supported because of the good they do for others. The food has always been great when they get it right! It's such a great place when the staff gets it right. Of course, they are closed now.....(oh and they never gave me a receipt, just assumed I didn't want it want it and immediately processed the next person's order....at that point couldn't go back to retrieve MY receipt). I even asked an employee about the dessert (vegan cheesecake) and she couldn't even tell me the flavors. She could have looked at it and just read the label. But, didn't even bother to do that. Dang, I could have eaten at so many other places in Hyde Park tonight. Disappointed again and out of $37. Welp, At least the lemonade was good. I believe in what they do so much to feed others that are less fortunate so much, that I would probably still be willing to go back, if my order was even just a little better tonight. After tonight I won't be back at all!! #DisappointedAgain",

Aside from the their late open times (their listings note  11am start times but they sometimes open later than 11), when calling the listed number for delivery per their website, the call disconnects as if the number is a bad number. Furthermore, they are listed on \"UberEats\" as a functional eatery, yet my attempts to successfully order from them have been futile with them having \"cancelled\" or \"not accepted\" my order no less than 3 times today without cause or reason. Amazing food does not excuse sub par professionalism in service",

My only issue with the place is that ran out of like 3 of the signature menu items right as i got up to the counter. I had to go with me 2nd choice bc the first was no longer available.

I usually get the Southwestern but replace the meat with soy, and if I'm especially hungry, I'll throw in some waffle fries, too (BEST waffle fries of my recent memory!)  Once I got stuck in traffic and showed up 15 minutes later than I expected to when picking up an order - staff noticed, and made me a fresh batch of waffle fries for free, since mine got cold. What??

Their menu reminds me of something a little kid would come up with because it is the most disorganized menu I have ever seen. From the way this place is ran, unorganized, not consistent ( got waffle fries burnt to a crisp (the employee was laughing when he gave it to me) , and unprofessional, I have come to the conclusion it is ran by some frat boy who thinks he is the best and just wants your money.",

I came here on a Saturday and it says your open from 630am to 12am and when I arrived at 7pm, you guys didn't have anything and told us to wait another 30mins. Smh. When it was time to order, the nightmare begins. They can not talk high volume orders so the customers needs to make there mines quick decisions about the one meal you want or else you will be pushed to side. The place is set up like chipotle but not ran like it. Food wasn't all that and I wouldve been better off making my tacos at home. Black owner takes an L for this one and I usual support black own businesses",

Turn around and look at the big ass board with all the ingredients listed.  Got home, took a bite. The chips were stale and the ground turkey dry. Sad.",

The font for menu on the display was a little bit too small and narrow to see, but they had a ton of laminated menus to review before placing an order.  I loved that there was vegan replacement options!  The line staff was very nice! The food was VERY flavorful and tasty! The portions was big enough to make a second meal out of it. I would just say, that the food was a little bit too heavy on the salt. That could be cut back a bit.  But overall, it was great! I love their message and their mission to use their gifts to make a positive impact on the community and the world! Keep it up!",
