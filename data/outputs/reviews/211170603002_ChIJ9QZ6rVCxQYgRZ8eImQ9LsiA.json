We decided on Cedars because it had a great view of some construction going on across the road where they are building what looks like apartments or condos. I'm a construction guy and they were using a crane to load some very large loads of lumber up to the fourth floor. I thought it would be fun to watch and have some lunch. I ordered the Cedar Burger and my wife had the shrimp tacos, which I believe was a special for Lent as I did not see it on their menu. Everything was served hot and delicious. My wife couldn't stop raving about the tacos and the Cedar Burger was cooked to perfection and very tasty. The service was good and the Covid protocols were all handled nicely. I would recommend stopping by Cedars anytime.",

The staff was super friendly and went above & beyond! We did have a large party of 15 so we waited 2 hours for a table. They do not have reservations option which is a bust because I hear they are always busy. But they kept in constant contact, served us drinks outside & were absolutely wonderful the entire time! We all got roses and the owner/manager (?) gave us complimentary champagne. The food was absolutely delicious & beautiful presentation. I should've taken pics of everyone's, not just mine. I cannot wait to return to try more items!",

Friends also got cocktails, which they enjoyed. The only negative comment may have been that the Bloody Mary was \"too spicy\" for my friend that ordered same.

Our food took over 30 mins to come out and my husbands crab Benedict was stone cold and waffles to my chicken and waffles were underdone and also cold. One of the servers that kept passing our table always seemed to have her mask pulled down. I work in the industry and know it can be hard at times.

Wide selection of drinks and food along with a full bar. I tried the Hawaiian Mimosa which was alright. Something about it being half full was off putting, but the flavors worked well. Not a memorable drink by any means. For breakfast I decided on the Hangover which is potatoes, eggs, chorizo, avocado, and some kind of great sauce. One of my eggs was over cooked so it didn't have the runny factor which would have really solidified this dish. It was great, but something I could also whip up at home pretty easy. This is a great spot for brunch with friends, but not somewhere I would hit up every brunch. The vibe is very Instagram-able though! Haha",
