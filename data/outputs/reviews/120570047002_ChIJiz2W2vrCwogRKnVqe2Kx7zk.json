The cook had to make more noodles to accommodate the couple who cut me off and me. I got a 2 entree dinner with noodles. The noodles tasted like straight up sesame oil and had no veg in it like its supposed to. The couple who cut me off got the very last bourben chicken and when I asked if they could make more she said \"no, no it takes to long to make\" and forced me to get the spicy chicken instead. The orange chicken didn't taste anything like I'm used too either. The cook threw in a couple egg rolls to make it better but when I bit into it, it was cold in the middle. It was all terrible. Hopefully I don't get food poisoning from the nasty spicy chicken and egg rolls that had been sitting in the heated pan for who knows how long. I am a fan of Chinese Gourmets food, especially for it being mall food, but this was severely disappointing. What a waste of a drive and $9.",
