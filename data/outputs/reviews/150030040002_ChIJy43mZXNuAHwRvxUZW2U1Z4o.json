The staff was all class. The Maitre D', Adam, was warm and welcoming; and our server Brycen took amazing care of us as we made our way through our culinary journey. It was a quiet evening, due to the pandemic im sure, but it left us feeling a bit like royalty. The food was imaginative and delicious, and Chef even came out to describe the courses! There was no opportunity for customer service missed. Justine, who runs the front of house, also came by to make sure everything was phenomenal. From start to finish, this was a top tier experience. We will definitely be back. 10/10 would recommend!",

Aesthetics very clean, modern and borderline industrial. We were seated at the bar side and the place holders were locally sourced so that in itself is a plus. We were offered the restaurant week menu as well as the house menu. We opted for restaurant week and glad for it. The RW menu included two options for each course, a 3-course menu (see picture). The pictures say it all and likely does not do it justice. Each dish was well thought out, paired well with wine options and delectable but very filling.  My favorite was the NZ green-lipped mussel as well as the chocolate brownie. Well done, Pai Honolulu! We will need to come again to try your regular menu!",

I made a last minute reservation for a birthday dinner and the staff called me the day before the reservation to ask about details and if I had any special requests.  When we arrived for our reservation a customized menu with our names and \"Happy Birthday\" was inscribed.  The staff cared about the little details that made the dinner so much more special.  The food was delicious and an abundance of flavors.  We had the seasonal chefs choice menu and the matching drink set. It was worth every penny.  Every dish was filled with unique flavors and surpassed our expectations and was presented personally by Chef Lee.  Our favorites were the lobster, the luau leaf ramen, and the matching wine/rose.  We look forward to going back for another 7+ course meal.",

I stopped by for the Chef's Seasonal Tasting Menu, which was more of an experience than the mere consumption of quality sustenance.  Course after course of thoughtful and varied fare that wasn't overly complicated. A standout for me was the Agedashi Tofu, which had a little bit of smoked fish on top and was remarkable. The cocktails are a good choice, and I'd suggest you try kind of a omakase with their bartender. I had some drinks which were on par with the excellent food, capped off by this inventive tea cocktail which I enjoyed greatly.  The whole place is clean, impressively so. The staff are professional and highly attentive, while remaining unobtrusive. The tasting menu was a good choice, because there's so much good food that you could become paralyzed with indecision.

It had to be creative, innovative, in a relaxed, non-pretentious atmosphere and yet afforadable. I literally scoured the internet and checked out menus and websites (oh-and it had to be a non-Waikiki location) and this one met all of my specs. Let me tell you that Pai's is a rare gem! It not only met my expectations, but exceeded it. From well trained and dedicated staff that were courteous and professional to a menu that cannot be found anywhere else. Each dish is thoughtfully executed-visually pleasing and well balanced. You can taste every single component that goes into each dish. If you are a steak, salad and potatoes kind of person and has to have oversized portions, then this is not the place for you! The menu will change with the seasons, so there will always be a reason to come back. I will add too, that the wine and spirits offereings are very exstensive for such a small establishment! And again, there are drinks on this menu that you will not find anywhere else as the bartender/mixologist created these drink recipes to serve here. This will become a regular stop for me each time I find myslef on Oahu (I live on Molokai).",

First off, there menu for food has two options, the small prix fixie menu or the large one, nothing else!  Both menus are expensive, but the large one at $145 a person plus $70 for the wine pairing is obsurd. When asking if we could take items from each menu we were told no because it \"ruins the integrity of the meal\". Whatever, we got the cheaper menu plus wine pairing. First course was a salad and I thought that tyre wine pairing was good. The salad had to much cheese, this was our favorite meal. Next was this clam curry that didn't taste like curry at all, and was in a broth more than the curry paste you would expect. The wine was chardonnay and didn't match well. Third course was a squid and pork pasta. I couldn't find any squid, but the real failure with this one was the heavy prosecco that they poured. They said this was to cleanse your palate after every bite. Seriously, I don't need a palate cleanser in the middle of my entree. Last was a raspberry sorbet with a coffee liquor. There was not enough raspberry, and I would have paired it with a nice port wine, not the cheap coffee liquor that was served. Overall pretty disappointing. They really need to change their Buisness model if they expect to survive.",

Our separate experiences had one thing in common... SALT.  Heavy on salt in most of the dishes we had. The dishes are beautiful, but the taste was so salty.  I wished our server asked us once how the food was. She never did. We would definitely have told her.  Pai being a new restaurant at the Harbour Court, you want it to succeed. Not many restaurants do in this location. But unfortunately, the tiny portions, deconstruct this, deconstruct that & the saltiness won't be inviting us back anytime soon.  The atmosphere is pretty, however, the servers do make you feel you should be at your best behavior since they're constantly changing your dinner & silverware -- even ones that weren't used.  I hope Pai's food improves... Good Luck!",

We had a counter seating which allowed us to watch over the food preparation and talk to the staff (which resulted in getting 2 extra deserts for free).  We ordered the chefs tasting menu. My husband had the caviar as an add-on.  Honestly I would not recommend getting the caviar - we assumed that that would mean he'd get an extra dish with caviar but instead he got it just added on top of 3 dishes, which honestly was a bit overpowering and detracted from those dishes.  Everything else was great.  All in all,if definitely recommend it for a big celebration!",
