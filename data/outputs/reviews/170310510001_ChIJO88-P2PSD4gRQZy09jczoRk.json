I called because the menu didn't allow me to add any instructions or additional items even if I was willing to pay for it. So I called. And the guy that answered tonight around 143am sounded irritated. I think I may have called too late? I dunno. Just tell me. I don't mind. Maybe I ordered too late? I asked if he had sauces I can add. Garlic perhaps? \"No.\" Okay. Do you have ranch by chance then?  \"Yes. Click***\" Ummmm is that a yes and I'll charge you $1 for it? Or a sure. No problem? I have no idea, maybe $5 and a surprise to my food? I was afraid to call back and ask because he might do something to my food.....(that's how little I trust this place) because he was already irritated, not because of it happening once. This is my third time trying with them. Sorry! I tried to order as soon we possible! If not, please let me know so I don't have worry about my food or next time ordering sooner per *store hours * that I will have to go through this.....just really, tell me the kitchen is closing and you can't take orders instead of just hanging up on me and providing service that makes me feel bad for ordering this late. Next time, I'll order Sarpinos since they never seem to have a problem this late at night. Thanks, but not thanks Stevo. Better to close at 8pm then later. I support our community and local businesses as much as I can and this is not the first time service has proven me that you're not apart of this. Letting it slide once should be enough, I was nice to let it slide yet again. Understanding it's late night. But now....again? Don't be open this late then if your service is going to be upset I order in ample enough of time. Or just tell me no. Kitchen is closed. Don't give service this way. Or close at 8pm or whatever.  However, your Uber driver, that is totally not affiliated with you....gave me much better service and respect than your \"Restaurant\" did.",

And it came with eight hard, cold, burnt, slices of Gyro on top of a mountain of soggy salad. I called to see if this could be fixed, as I didn't mind waiting for another one to come. I would have given them the original salad back with no hesitation or issue... But the guy who picked up, Mike, had an extremely rude attitude with me and told me there was nothing that they could do. Based on the fact that this is probably the simplest thing you could make, I'm going to confidently say that everything there must be absolute garbage. Don't go there, don't order your food from there, it's not worth your money. There are a ton of awesome places in Chicago that you could go to, with better food AND service. To be completely honest the thing that I'm most upset about is the level of disrespect. If you are going to charge for extra meat, it should at least be more than what would be stuffed into a children's gyro.",
