The dishes on the main board don't have any description, but they have a printed menu that does once you find it at the order station.  It might help a bit if they redid their menu board with pictures and then have a larger color plastic menu at the order station to make it a little easier to figure out what to order especially if you are unfamiliar with the dishes or don't know the differences between them.  I ordered the Kao Poon, a Laotian dish that was over the top with great flavors.  It was like a combination of Thai soups and curries in a dish that mixed them all.  I got it with shrimp and they to my surprise, didn't cook it in advance which left the shrimp delicate and juicy and not hard and over cooked when places use precooked shrimp.  It was not to thin yet not to then with the broth and with the noodles and cabbage, left you feeling satisfied.  You can tell this was a family business by the motherly types in the kitchen making sure the younger ones running the orders where in check.  They are all very friendly and made sure I was satisfied with my meal.  I do plan to go back again and check out some of their other dishes. I was very happy to see this place stay authentic and not watered down for Westerners' which drives me crazy with a lot of Asian places. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!",
