The staff is fantastic and knows every single thing on the shelves, and while there is a small selection it is kind of everything that you need. The wine choices are on point, and they are happy to help you pick out a bottle to go with the food that they make in their ovens, which I highly recommend! They work with a lot of local purveyors, so I get my local coffee, my local milk, and even pick up my hyperlocal CSA produce right there. They are amazingly welcoming to my dog and my daughter, and so it is a pleasure to go in there every time.",

They are a boutique store and they don't do everything, but everything they do, they do well. Best pizza in town. Amazing bread, meats, and baking supplies (e.g., fresh milled flour). Don't come here looking for a broad selection, but know that what they have is carefully selected and high quality. They also have an awesome beer and wine selection, and the wine is at a very attractive price point. If my wife and I ever move, being closer to Old City would be a selling point for the house!",

That's what I say is over and above great service.  Side note food was great! This is a must visit!",

As I was looking around ( selection on the shelves is limited but excellent, there is a good variety of homemade food though) I realized Mary genuinely treated each customer in the same manner. I ordered two pizzas and as a native New Yorker I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pies, the tomato, mozzarella and chorizo was excellent, the second pie pesto, ricotta and spinach was very good as well. Looking forward to many more visits and trying other dishes . Highly recommended",
