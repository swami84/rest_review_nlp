Had lunch there for a co workers birthday a couple days ago, service was mehh, but understandable considering COVID, the staff is 1 counter person do it all besides the kitchen staff....the seafood broils are good, don't like their crawfish, assuming its frozen for months, shrimp, mussels & calamari was good, Catfish Po boy was very delicious! Seafood fried rice as well. I would definitely recommend trying their food!",

We had a little leftover after splitting between 2 of us, if you\u2019re splitting between more, I\u2019d recommend adding rice or a side to soak up the extra sauce. Mild level of spice is very mild, so level up if you\u2019re a spice fan.  5 stars all around, will definitely be ordering again!",

Prices were very fair given the generous portion sizes. They're very fast -- food was ready to pick up 15 min after ordering. I was also happy to see the premises looked very clean, and that they had a large shield to protect the staff behind the register. Really happy they joined the neighborhood!",
