Mango chicken is supposed to be like orange chicken, just with a mango twist. This dish literally consisted of about 2.5oz of boiled chicken and the rest is about a pound of mango chunks, bell peppers, and pineapple in a watery sauce. I took one bite of the mango and it tasted like warm mango boiled in chicken juice. Absolutely disgusting. The panang curry didn\u2019t have any vegetables the chicken was rubbery and over cooked and the curry sauce was watery and bland. I want to return the mango dish because it\u2019s so disgusting. I can\u2019t believe people are allowed to serve food like this. We are never eating here again.",

Two of our appetizers, the chive dumplings and the fried bananas, were inedible. The chive dumplings were burnt on the outside and completely raw on the inside, indicative of grease that is way too hot. The fried bananas came in an open container (our brown bag was sealed so it had to have been left opened at the restaurant). They were also very greasy, hard, and chewy.

I ordered the chicken with mango and rice entree, pork fried rice, and fried banana rice paper rolls. The chicken was presented nicely, inside the scooped out mango skin. But the taste of the chicken was so bland. It was literally boiled chicken. The mango and sauce were so cloyingly sweet, the dish was syrupy. I was not prepared for the amount of sweetness. I expected a combination of sweet and savory, not liquid sugar. The worst offender however was the fried rice. The stench!!! It reeked so badly of dead fish/corpse/idk what. My toddler started gagging and ran out of the room. I decided to try it anyway. Nope. Tastes as bad as it smells. Seriously insulting. The only thing that was edible were the fried plantain rolls. I guess one star for those and another for on time delivery. Seriously, pass on this place.",

It's sad because they used to serve silkworms as a exotic appetizer which they do not do back 10 years ago. Most Westerners would find eating that gross, disgusting or repulsive but I came to try it out of curiosity and apprehension. Silkworms taste almost like shrimp with popcorn crunch. Wish you could bring this dish back on the menu.",

Parking wasn't easy - if you are coming from the south, the only way to park is U-turn. Don't try to get into side streets - it is a maze that would take you over 10 min to get out. We went here because of good reviews and the price wise it was said to be a great deal for the money. That is what set wrong expectations. I ate Thai in California and Maryland - the places were modern but this place feels old and unpopular. I guess it is the wrong area to look for modern happy restaurant.",

No, I'm not just an ignorant American who doesn't eat ethnic food--I've eaten at a lot of thai places--there was just something weird with the smell and it made me feel a bit grossed out.  I think if I order again I'll get take-out.  There food was really excellent, and I can tell you that it's the best Northern Thai that I've had in a long time.  I got the Pad See Ew, and it was cooked to perfection.  I'm going to order again soon because I really want to give them four stars.  Just that smell in the restaurant was a bit overwhelming.",

The flavor was pungent and had flavors that blended well together.  I had the Kow Soy which is a Northern Thai dish which is made of a spicy curry and egg noodles.  It is very difficult to make this dish as I have yet to find somewhere that makes it like they do in Northern Thailand.  It was not the right taste, but it was okay.  Also, don't get the thai tea. The flavor is watered down, and it's too sweet.",

Actually, I don't know why I've never even been there before after being from Chicago and having been to so many Thai places in the city.  The service was good and it wasn't even crazy crowded on this Friday night.  I guess since it's kind of outside the downtown area and Lincoln Park and those types of neighborhoods it was fine.  It wasn't dead either - it was just right.  One thing I'd say could have been better was that the entrees were served almost immediately after the appetizers; there needed to be more of a gap.  Everyone was still having the soup when the main entrees arrived.  So we had a BUNCH of food here; much more than was necessary.  So the veggie dumplings were great.  They were small little things, when compared to the normal sized gyoza that I've had at other places.  Very crispy too, because they were deep fried instead of lightly fried.  Definitely yummy though.  Then we had some Tom Kha soup.  Again, it was good.  Then the best thing I had was the Pad Ke Mow.  Really amazing.  One of the best I've had.  I think I'd get it more spicy, the next time I order it.  Then, the red curry was good.  Usually this is my test of how much I like a new Thai place.  In that sense, the red curry was good.  Not that I can pin down what made it less than great.  It was good.  Lastly, we felt a bit too brave and had decided to push our luck and we ended up ordering some Pad something eggplant item.  This was just kind of... meh...  The only disappointing part of the SR.  Oh yeah, I also had a Thai Iced Coffee, which was good.  I look forward to visiting Sticky Rice again.  Add one more good Thai place to my list!",

With every dish you order, they will ask you the level of spicyness you want.  Be careful if you ask for spicy because they will follow your order and make it SPICY, not kidding.  I love that all of their fried rice dishes come with a fried egg...just the way I like it.  They also don't skimp out on the meat.  I order the duck fried rice and I was not able to finish all the meat because there was just way too much.  The panang curry is also very good.  It's just the right consistency, not too think or liquidy. You'd be surprised how many places don't make their curries correctly.  PS. There is plenty of side street parking available.",

It was FANTASTIC. It was served inside a hollowed out pineapple and had an amazing mix of just enough spice and sweetness. Overall, highly recommended. Oh, and it's BYOB.
