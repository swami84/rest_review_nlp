There were a multitude of questions that came with each order. I had to keep asking her what she said many times and I could tell she was getting annoyed so not to upset her I just guessed and nodded my head. The food I got wasn't what I ordered. My polish dog I ordered looked more like chorizo with tomatoes, dill pickel, peppers, and relish that looked like it was dyed in neon paint. I didn't bother trying to communicate again and threw the hot dog in the trash and ate somewhere else. The fries were good.",

First, it's not fully vegan,you have to ask for no mayo and cheese.Second, their ( homemade?) patty is one of the worst things I've ever tasted,: it was pure mush, tasteless and had chopped peas and carrots randomly mixed in,served on a wheat bun (vegans eat regular eggless buns guys!) and regular burger toppings.Ended up throwing almost the whole things away since it tasted like nothing and the mush texture.Also, one of the female employees kept taking her making off to blow bubbles by the counter,clearly ignoring COVID-19 per cautions.Hopefully they completely change the vegan burger and make it fully vegan (cheese and all) and start to respect the restrictions.",

He helped us through the menu and gave us some history on the local food traditions. I probably would\u2019ve liked the place regardless of the food, solely because of Danny\u2019s hospitality, but LET ME TELL YOU...I have never seen my boyfriend devour his meal so fast. He said it was the BEST sandwich he\u2019s EVER eaten. We\u2019re Cuban from Miami and he said he will never enjoy a Cuban again unless it\u2019s dipped like this. \ud83d\ude02 Danny, AMAZING job!

It looked like it was made fresh which is good but I was disappointed when I took a bite. You are probably better off ordering a vegan burger at another place. They do offer more vegan options though which I haven't try but I would still give them a second chance. The french fries were pretty good and the pricing is not too bad. My aunt had the ribs which she thought was good.",
