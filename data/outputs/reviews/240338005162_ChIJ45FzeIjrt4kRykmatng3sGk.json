Tried the online ordering through the app and they lost the order. Then today we used the \u201cGet in Line\u201d function on the app at 10:00am. It told us when to arrive to the restaurant - 11:05am. We arrive and the hostess tells us that the wait will be another 45 minutes. When we expressed our frustration we were told that it\u2019s out of her control and nothing we can do. Then after her poor explanation asked if what she was saying \u201cmade sense\u201d? I told her it did not and then the cashier jumped in as well to say it was out of their control. My whole thing: FIX IT! Poor experiences all around from dealing with their ridiculous application to their patronizing hostess and cashier.",

When I went to pay, a message stating \u201cthe restaurant is at capacity and would no longer be accepting orders\u201d pops up. First Watch cancelled my order and said a refund would be sent out in 7-10 business days. The \u201clive\u201d feature on Google said the restaurant wasn\u2019t busy, so I was confused.  I tried Door Dash to make sure it wasn\u2019t just their site, but I got the same results. So, I decided to call the restaurant, and the employee that answered said they weren\u2019t taking orders over the phone... try the website. I explained what was happening, but I already knew there was nothing she could do about it. I guess this location is short staffed or something to shut down ALL online ordering and all I ordered was two sides and a muffin.

My recent problem is that they advertise that you can get delivery through Doordash but it will show their restaurant as closed on the app at random times throughout the week, so I can't order even right as they open in the morning. I've tried calling the restaurant and they say they turn it off or on depending on how busy they are--which seems weird because they're a business, don't they want to make money?  Anyways, I still recommend them for the good variety of breakfast/lunch foods, but hope they can figure out the delivery issue.",

I've been a repeat customer here and today will definitely be my last.  The manager with the forehead and the glasses (I believe Ken is the name) is usually the one managing the Sunday's I come in and it has been consistently terrible each time. From unreasonable wait times (1 hour+ when told 25-30 minutes) to incomplete or messy packaging (throwing the food on top of the condiment cups causing them to bust open all over the food), there seems to be no competence at this store. I say the store because every employee I've interacted with has been nonchalant and disengaged.  I attempted several times to address this with Ken but neither he or anyone else responded.  I've found Milk and Honey Cafe and Keith & Son's as better alternatives. More options, can manage a weekend rush, and has higher quality meat options.",

        "caption": "The food is good, but not worth the over-extended and inconsiderate wait times; especially if you're on borrowed time. We've frequented this spot many times since moving to Upper Marlboro, MD five plus years ago. It's very popular. However, we've also watched the wait times increase drastically at this location over the years.  The last straw for us occurred right before the holidays. We called ahead to get on the list (they use an app). We were traveling from an early morning appointment in Laurel. Easily a 40-45 min trip.  By the time we arrived, we were still at least 12th in line.  So we waited another 30+ minutes to be seated. After we were seated, we waited for the waiter (another 10-15 min). Placed our drink orders and also ordered appetizers and our main courses (hoping to speed things up). We received our drinks 5-10 min later, and politely asked the waiter if we could eat within the hour, because we had an important appointment at noon (current time, 10:45).  Now granted she respectfully said she wasn't sure we could eat that quickly, we did offer the option of taking it to go if we weren't eating by 11:15. Then we waited.  At 11:15, no food or waiter.  At 11:25, we asked another waiter to call our waiter. Then we asked if the food was ready and relayed that we needed it to go.  She responded that it was almost ready and would prepare to go bags (current time, 11:35). We then explained our concern given how long we'd been waiting (almost an hour just for food...including our appetizers). Her response was that it's not the kitchen or the wait staff, it's the fact that customers don't leave after they eat, instead they continue to occupy a table until they want to leave.  And further, that this is an ongoing issue that management has been trying to figure out how to deal with. As soon as she said this...my wife and I looked at each other.  I knew we were thinking the same thing...this still doesn't explain why it took so long to get our food (or at least appetizers), especially if the restaurant is already aware of the fact that wait times to be seated are extremely long.  This is why we feel the wait time was inconsiderate and therefore have decided to find other options, even if we have to travel further...because after a total wait time of 2.5hrs (from Laurel to being seated and receiving our food in Bowie), there's no doubt we'll actually be able receive our food faster, anywhere else.",

Besides the wait, the food at this location is easily five stars. It is worth the wait. The last time that I visited this place, my breakfast tacos were hard.

They didn't text us (or texted the wrong number) when our table was ready. However, they quickly seated us when we came in to check 15 min later. Beautiful place! Service was initially slow but our server was amazing! She was very kind and checked on us often. The food was delicious and I love the selection. I also appreciate the effort to provide healthy options-- most, if not all, of their pancakes/waffles are multigrain. This is the second First Watch I've been to and I'm still impressed.

Food we ordered contained  wax paper from cheese and large piece of onion skin, and rubbery skin of roast beef, possible chew all in the same sandwich.  I must say incredible, isn't it? Then waiter tred to defend it by saying just a paper from the cheese. Don't I know that? I strongly feel he needs customer service education.   Many establishment here in town need to have terrible customer service.  Still there are some places still maintain high customer service. The rest are  terrible.  For example Applebees, I love the place, but I won't go one in Bowie, because terrible customer service. that applied almost all chain restaurants.   If I want to go, I will drive further north. It is very unfortunate. I am changing to 1 star.. When I was eating the second set that they made for me . it STILL contain outer yellow onion skin. Again it was very nice place. Terrible. I did leave a message to their corporate office. Hopefully I get a call back.",

        "caption": "Dined in around 8:30 on a Sunday morning. No wait to be seated. Noticeable delay in initial contact with server. Server was pleasant and efficient, recalled multiple item order w/o taking notes. Beverages arrived within 5 minutes of order (coffee - good; turmeric/beet/ginger drink - delicious but found dried food stuck inside cup; water - it's water, but the temperature was perfect). Food arrived within 20 minutes of ordering. If you're in a hurry, that may be a problem but I intended this to be a leisurely breakfast so all good. Food itself: floridian brioche french toast - decent crunch and flavor on toast, some of the fruit was past its prime and one had a short curly hair on it, heated cheap, corn syrup syrup - no thanks, also noticed fruit flies (in winter) hovering around the decanter by the time I discovered it placed behind the coffee pot; fruit compote was all that was needed as dressing and it was good; cheese grits - forgettable. There were many people waiting by the time I left around 10:00. Verdict - slightly more varied \"healthy\" menu than IHOP with better ambiance but also more pricey. Concerned about cleanliness. No plans to return.",

I waited 15 minutes to be seated when there was no wait for tables and almost an hour for my order which came out different from the menu description - the Elevated Egg Sandwhich is supposed to have an over easy egg and smashed avocado and mine had neither. I was able to get smashed avocado on the side from an apologetic waitress who was not at fault at all! Basically for how busy this place was, the service was way too slow. And for how busy it can get, they need to increase their staff significantly. I give 2 stars because the food was edible and I had a slightly better experience my last visit. But seriously, not a quick lunch and not worth the wait with the number of other restaurants in walking distance!",

After being told there was a 25min to an hour wait, we decided to stay. A friend had invited me and I wanted to check it out. Close to 2 hours later, I was perplexed why some people seemed to be literally forgotten about. After checking with the woman at the check-in desk a couple of times inquiring when we would be seated, I learned you can request advance seating via the First Watch app.  When finally called to sit, we were seated at a corner booth next to the kitchen.  There were little insects all over the walls and decor above the booth.  We immediately asked to be seated elsewhere.  An employee said the booth had been closed off before due to the same issue. After being reseated, we waited another 15 mins for waitstaff to come to the table.  At this point, we were ready to go.  Kelly asked why we were leaving, we explained how disappointed we had been so far.  Kelly apologized and asked us to stay.  She promised to make sure the kitchen expedited our food quickly. The problem seems to be there is no formula to work in walk-ins so you end up sitting for ridiculous periods of time while the folks using the app get first preference.  This is totally unfair if you 1) have never been to First Watch before or 2) don\u2019t know about the app.  We arrived at 11:15am and weren\u2019t seated until after 1pm.  I realize we didn\u2019t have to wait but others may want to know it isn\u2019t worth going on weekends unless you use the app before going.  The food was overshadowed by the horrendous experience.",

I used the First Watch app to secure a wait time of 12:35 today, showed up at the appropriate time, and waited another 10 minutes to be seated. However, as my party was being seated, the other host seated another customer at our table, although our host apologized for the mistake he forgot about us.  We waited another 10 minutes, after which I had to remind the host station that I was still waiting for another table. After being seated, we ordered drinks, which were delivered rather quickly. After receiving our drinks, we ordered breakfast for the table and waited 50 minutes for the food or an explanation from any staff member to explain the delay in our food, but received nothing. After 50 minutes, I asked our server about our meal and she mentioned that it was about to be delivered to the table. Due to the long wait I asked for the meals to be packaged to go as we had another engagement at 3pm. Unfortunately, we waited another 10 minutes for the to-go packages. Opening our to-go bag on the road, we realized that only one meal was in our bag. Instead of the Huevos Rancheros that we ordered, we received a small box of lettuce instead. The overall experience was rather poor and embarrassing as I tried to impress the service and quality of food on my guest. While I will still patron First Watch restaurants, I will not be returning to this one.",

Let me start by saying do not order the tostada, especially if you're expecting avocados. The old piece of avocado I received on each of my \"tostada\" was not even 1/4 or 1/10 of an avocado. I ordered extra avocado and it was smaller than the others ones! To make matters worse the food was cold, and by cold I mean C.O.L.D.! There was a customer waiting to pay and after receiving his food to go...you got that part right-He received his to-go food....NO ONE checked him out....he waited for 30 min then left. You want to know what EVERY STAFF member was doing? They were in the back being obnoxiously loud and disruptive as if they were are a party. I had to go to the kitchen ask for a to go cup and Lord knows it was as if I had ask the waiter to go to the factory and make it. At no point did the manager on duty come to my table or said anything. One staff member - THAT WAS NOT EVEN MY WAITRESS- apologized and gave me a complimentary meal coupon. This was my favorite spot when they first opened...never again!",

Ordered a omelette and the avocado within was rotten (photos provided). When I brought this to the waiter's attention, he responded by saying: \"the avocado is fine, I saw them cut it, it's just \"'air'-'ration.'\" I believe he meant oxidation but the avocado was obviously rotten. I asked for a reasonable discount and I had to wait over fifteen minutes for the bill as he ignored me while he was entertaining other customers. He nonchalantly dropped the receipt on my table and walked off.  When I went to pay, I mentioned the situation to the cashier (who acted as if she were his manager) and explained to her that serving expired food presents health problems to the consumer. In response, I was basically told to be grateful that I received a two-dollar discount because a plate of vegetables costs $1.60. No apologies, no concern from staff - better service, better quality at IHOP...don't waste money and more importantly your time.",
