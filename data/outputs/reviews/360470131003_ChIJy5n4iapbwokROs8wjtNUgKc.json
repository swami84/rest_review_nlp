        "caption": "Well let me first say that my order did come on time. However my issue was with the food. It felt like I wasted my money.  I ordered the Thai Basil Fried Rice. As other reviewers have stated, it is bland and doesn't have much flavor. Furthermore, it had waaayyy too much rice in proportion to the amount of chicken they put in the dish. So essentially I paid $10 for a big bowl of tasteless rice with some pieces of chicken. I feel like a dummy paying all that money for bland, tasteless rice with questionable \"white meat\" chicken.  The chicken in the Thai Basil Fried Rice has that familiar weird texture that is popular among those questionable Chinese restaurants throughout NYC. It looks  like it could be white meat, but it can't be real chicken breast because real chicken breast ain't that soft  Overall, I hated the dish I got. I would not order it again, and I would not want to try anything else they have. I wasted $20 that I will never get back on two Thai Basil Fried Rice dishes :-(  The food basically seemed like it had no passion, or love in it. They just threw food in a bowl, closed the lid, and sent it off with the delivery guy. These are the kind of restaurants that need to be closed down, because they don't add any culinary value to our neighborhoods.",
