I\u2019d recommend getting one of the dark chicken entrees instead.",

The lunch special is wonderful- you can try a couple different dishes and even add on some small appetizers, sides a la carte (to the lunch special- it's great!). The lunch box special is like a half order of your choice of 2 different items and is amazing!  I most recently ordered the chicken saag and lamb curry lunch box and added on one of each lamb samosa and vege samosa. I would want to come here for lunch every day if I lived closer.  I haven't had any complaints from food here and I have a delicate stomach. It is a little pricier than other Indian food in the city, but for wicker park- it's similar to most restaurants in the area. This is one of those restaurants that I always meant to try and slept on, but now I will go out of the way to pick up takeout from. Highly recommend.",

He even advised the catering staff about the proper way to serve them when they got there a little later.  Wonderful experience overall!!",

I usually prefer hotter dishes but enjoyed the flavors of this dish. The wait staff didn\u2019t ask about heat preference.

The momos are underwhelming watery dumplings that come with a bright orange dipping sauce that tastes like disappointment with an aftertaste of turmeric. The keema matar had some good flavor but a la carte for a small bowl of the curry at $17 pretty much guarantees I won't order it again. The walls, menus, and tablecloth had multiple stains and food remnants which made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the place. The sambhar soup had an interesting flavor reminiscent of burnt vegetables that didn't altogether work against it. We had tried the buffet originally when it opened and were so underwhelmed that it took us years to go back but after this experience I likely won't go again.",

We had to frequently remind her to remove glasses and plates from our table as well. The rest of our meal took another half hour after that. The food was good but overpriced for what it was. You shouldn't have to pay separately for plain white rice... We weren't the only upset table that night, we overheard numerous other tables complaining about how long the food was taking and how poor the service was.

        "caption": "Meals much like life, truly are in this particular circumstance about the destination and not the journey.  On a night like any other, I along with my girlfriend, entered Cumin. We browsed the menu and decided to give it a try. The place was quaint and cute. There weren\u2019t many people inside so we figured it would be a fairly standard meal.  We were wrong.  What was to come was more of an emotional roller coaster than watching Game of Thrones for the first time. We were completely unaware of the ups and downs that soon would behold us in the next hours of our life. Much like Batman, we had dark and light times ahead. For Gotham, is a city that perpetually is enshrouded in darkness but will always hold a slight spark of hope.  We noticed the tables next to us impatiently trying to hail down services, which we brushed off. It should have been foreshadowing for us. We saw to-go orders piling up by the door in trows, but the people inside the spot were searching for whom to place orders and  with whom to check out.  We were given some crackers and we placed our orders once our server came around.  He left and disappeared into the kitchen.  The other tables who had been there before us seemed to keep receiving more crackers and no food.  We\u2019d begun to wonder if we entered an Indian food spot covering for an undercover cracker operation.  To save time and minutia, about 30 minutes passed and we had not received food. We did have hope due to some people who were sat before us receiving clean plates. But still no food.  More minutes passed.  Every minute that passed lead to twitches and anxiety due to premonitions of therapy sessions covering neglect in our futures. We both looked at each other and awaited to see if anyone else received food or service.  Minutes of frustration led to seconds of madness. And in those seconds, a quote from the Joker came into mind.  \u201cMadness, as you know, is like gravity, all it takes is a little push.\u201d  We found ourselves debating if we should leave. We turmoiled over all the possible outcomes of leaving versus staying in order to ease our screaming hunger from the depths of our stomachs.  I was reminded of a quote from Alfred Pennyworth, \u201cEndure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman, he can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make, the right choice.\u201d  I pondered the right choice. What does that look like? And in my hazy confusion and aguish the clouds seemed to part as a couple minutes passed.  On the brink of insanity, we both on the edges of our seat in a phantom state were awoken by clean white plates presented in front of us.  We knew it was our time.  We had gone through the struggles and risen from the pit like Bruce Wayne and saw the light of day again.  The moments proceeding this were pure bliss. Pure bliss as heaps of rice, Lamb Saag, Garlic Naan and Chicken Tiki Marsala landed in our laps like newborn babies onto a virgins lap.  We were in another world as we ravenously consumed every shred of food in front of us.  Taste buds exploded into pure fountains of joy in our mouths. Tears streaming down our faces in what seemed to be a beautiful mix of euphoria and terror. Every bit of anger and frustration we had from the forty-five minutes prior those moments of food decimation were sweet out through tracks of joy along our foreheads and cheeks.  We were beyond bliss.  We were 11/10 happy. We were Chocolate Boy from Hey Arnold! With a huge sack of chocolate, happy.  Through tears, we blinked and nodded as we both knew. We both knew we were in food heaven.  I sit here days, months, possibly even years after this experience. I only say this due to not understanding space or time since. I don\u2019t know who I am or my purpose. I just know I must return to Cumin. Through the neglect and rejection, the food calls me back. Like the Matrix beckons to Neo. I am being called back. The food knows me. For I am the chosen one for it. I will return. It knows I will return. It is only a matter of time.",

Started with some momos which were fantastic, then had the goat curry (gorkhali khasi), which was extremely tasty and very flavorful. Got the regular naan and then the lamb naan, which is now my favorite naan as of this writing.  If you get the momos, they tell you that it'll take around 10 minutes to make because they make it fresh. Yea it really did take 10 or more minutes, so if you're in such a hurry, I'd skip that BUT if you're not, I throughly enjoyed it and recommend it. The plain basmati rice was also fantastic. It was really soft and aromatic compared to other basmati rice.  Also we ordered from the menu. We didn't eat the buffet.",
