I've done the 4 course takeaway meal twice and literally almost cried both times. It is the most beautiful food I've had in a long time. Every bite is swirling with expansive flavor, hitting notes like a well-mastered album on audiophile headphones. And the customer service is lovely, accommodating my allergy with caring grace.

Both were amazing, which was especially notable since often restaurants struggle to make delicious vegan meals. The dessert was a deconstructed apple crisp with peach sorbet. Yummm...

The service here was excellent, waiters were very kind, water was refilled quickly, and food came out fast and well-paced as we ate.  The food was mostly good, but one or two dishes weren\u2019t as well-made as the rest. The ham was heavily over cooked, and so was very dry and chewy. On the flip side, the steak was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  I would also suggest that you order with restraint. We were a party of about 9, so we had a smaller preset menu (that we chose what to preset, and were able to customize a title, which was cute) that we ordered from. The waiter suggested two of each app for the table to try, and everyone\u2019s own mains. The table comes with bread, and the cheese board is HUGE and has more bread. We felt like we ate a whole meal before we even ordered our mains. So, unless you\u2019re feeling super hungry, definitely start slow and order more as you get through the meal.",

While the restaurant has four parking spaces - they were occupied by the staff, grump, so parking is a serious problem for non-residents.Our dinner was for four seasoned eaters celebrating a new venture. You will not go home hungry. The owner visited our table, lovely, the waitstaff was attentive, the chef was more than capable and the ambiance was quiet and comfortable. Forage was as advertised - steak but without the sizzle which is fine but a little sizzle will go a long way toward establishing Forage's identity.",

I'm always a little suspicious of an over--emphasis on local foods (and the implicit assumption, sometimes false, that they have less embodied energy) but Forage pulled off a great series of dishes without any of that annoying pretension. We especially liked the Cured Char appetizer with the char, sea cabbage, and hemlock tips--delicious! The lamb and the maltagliate were also excellent. The wait staff was attentive without being invasive.",
