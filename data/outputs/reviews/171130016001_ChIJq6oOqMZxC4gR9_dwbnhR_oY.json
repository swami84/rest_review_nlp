        "caption": "Leaving this review on my second google account because my complaint was never responded to on my original  \"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Edit: Okay so first of all whoever it was that responded to my original review didn\u2019t even spell my name right when they addressed me, it\u2019s not that hard just read, it\u2019s literally spelled out for you at the beginning of the review. Second of all here is my edit. 2-3 months ago I was at your place of business. I had a 100% completely terrible experience, the worst of my life actually. I was at your bar having a beer with my friend after we had seen a live show up the street at jazz up front (which I would highly recommend over this place to anyone interested) I had one beer while I was there, it started getting late and closing time came around. The bouncer started ushering people out the door, but at that point in time I was waiting for one of my friends to come out of the bathroom, so I stayed inside. The bouncer walked up to me once everyone was gone and started getting very agitated with me that I wasn\u2019t leaving. I started trying to explain to him that I was waiting for someone to come out of the bathroom and I was finishing my drink while I waited. Before he even let me get more than two words out he started yelling at me to leave. I again tried explaining to him that I was waiting for my friend to come out of the bathroom, and that I was gonna wait inside for him because it was extremely cold outside that night. While I was trying to tell him this the bouncer grabbed my drink out of my hand and crushed it and spilled it all over the floor, which really kinda ****** me off because it was a 7 dollar can of beer and I had barely had any of it. He set it on a table behind him after crushing it in his hands and I went to reach for it because, in my mind since I paid for it that is my property and him nor any of your employees had any right to take it from me. I then went to reach for the can because I wanted it back, and when I did that your employee literally grabbed me by the shoulder and threw me across the entire room towards the door. I wasn\u2019t being uncooperative, vulgar, physical, or anything of the sorts with him. I was literally just trying to explain that I was waiting for someone to come out of the bathroom. He practically assaulted me, AND he made first contact after I had not provoked him at all. If you think this is the way you\u2019re supposed to run a business, then I just have to say you\u2019re seriously a huge moron. I have literally never received worse customer service anywhere in my life, and never before has an employee of an establishment laid their hands on me and thrown me across the room. What kind of a ******* business model is that? Do you implore you\u2019re employees to be rude and aggressive with all your customers?? Because it really seems that way to me. Nightshop went from being one of my favorite venues in all of Bloomington to a place that I will literally never step foot in again in one single night. You need to get your $*** together, like seriously what happened is not f****** okay at all and I almost called the police and reported your business for it. This employee deserves to be fired immediately, and you will never have my respect as a consumer again until that happens. I don\u2019t know what his name is, but whoever that fat f****** bouncer with the nasty beard is, thats who needs to go. I highly doubt anyone will read this review, but I hope they do just so you lose all of the business you don\u2019t deserve to be getting because of the way you\u2019re allowing your establishment to be run....honestly I would love to speak to Chris about this, because I know that he\u2019s the owner , and I know that because he\u2019s childhood best friends with MY best friends mom and ive met him before and he seems like a great guy. I can\u2019t honestly believe that he\u2019s letting his business be run this way, it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous and I honestly feel like I deserve a sincere apology from him for this incident\"",

NOT SO MUCH.  After an hour of waiting for our waiting to come back, noticing other tables that came after us had gotten their food, and sitting with empty beers, another waitress came and asked if we needed anything. We said we had placed our food order an hour ago and still had not received it. Her response was \u201clet me go check\u201d. After that, she never came back to let us know what happened, never apologized, nothing. 15 more minutes went by and my friend then went and asked what was going on because he spotted our waiter at the bar. He said that they forgot to make the food but that they were taking care of it now and that our bill would be taken care of. Five minutes later we received our order for three people and all three meals were wrong.  1. I ordered 2 breakfast sliders that came with egg, cheese, and bacon, and if 2 were ordered it was supposed to come with chips for free. My sliders had no bacon and I received no chips...basically an over cooked egg slapped on a bun w/ some cheese. 2. My one friend\u2019s meal was a hoagie and the bacon on the hoagie was not cooked and there was a HAIR in his fries, probably from the chef he watched come out to deliver other food while wearing rubber gloves and touched his hair with the gloves he brought the food out with. 3. My other friends meal got nachos that were supposed to come with beer cheese and other various toppings, but she instead received a pile of dry chips with no beer cheese and very scarce other toppings, no sour cream, etc.  We then STILL never heard from our waiter. My friend went up to ask if we could pay the bill for the food that was wrong, had hair in it, and so we could go eat elsewhere, to which the waiter responded that we could leave and they\u2019d eat the bill.  We decided to go here because my friend had had good experiences in the past, but now after reading reviews of others with similar experiences, will DEFINITELY not be returning. There\u2019s a difference between being a trendy hipster place and just being plain ignorant.",

Well, you never know what you're going to get when you leave the safety of the everyday world and walk into the bastion of rubber stamp originality and aper artistry that is Nightshop!  Is the bartender going to say anything to you, or will you just draw a blank stare until you spit out your drink order and they walk away without saying a word, get drinks for others for the next 15 minutes, leaving you to wonder if you'll ever get to try that latest craft beer that you're kinda stoked to try? You just don't know!  Will your server even walk up to your table of two within the first 15 minutes of your arrival and even acknowledge your existence in this world, or will you have to watch a daytime drama unfold as a person buckles under the pressure of having three tables to serve at the same time. Three. At. The. Same. Time! You simply can't call these things, but maybe Nightshop can charge extra for the privilege of viewing the fake, dramatic gestures of the waiters!  Is your food going to be cold when it gets to your table after sitting on the shelf for 40 minutes? Ha Ha!  Who knows, man! It happened to the people a couple of tables down, but you actually have to get to the ordering stage first!  Is the food even going to be good? That's for Nightshop to know and for you to find out! And you're not finding out tonight, suckaaaaaa!  Will you make new friends with the guests at the table next to you while you both question what crimes against the universe you've committed to warrant this purgatory? For sure! There's always a silver lining! Too bad there are no drinks at either table to raise and cheer!  Are you going to get fed up with this pretentious, unnecessarily painful, dramatic unfolding of what should be an enjoyable meal and just walk out the door and go to any of the other places in town that serve good food? Of course!  Seriously, Nightshop? The food isn't so great and the atmosphere isn't so awesome that inconsistencies in quality and awful service can be attributed to part of the \"vibe\" or shrugged off as part of the experience. \"The kitchen is short staffed, so your food will take an hour\" still doesn't explain getting snubbed for nearly 20 minutes after arrival. And it doesn't justify your server clutching his pearls and giving you an exasperated response when asking him for some, you know...service.  But you get 2 stars because your dude at the door was super cool, actually spoke words to people, and apologized for the rest of the staff being completely inept. The best parts of the entire visit were walking in and walking out.  People with bad hygiene, homemade hack job haircuts/dye jobs, bad tattoos, caked lipstick, and jack squat to do aren't the only people who like to hang out, have a few drinks, and eat a decent meal. Actually getting to order *a* drink and some food should be a no-brainer. Get it together, Nightshop. I really want to like this place, but the past couple of visits have been straight up terrible.",

They have the best outdoor patio in downtown and have live music daily. They recently raised some of their prices which is a bummer but it was a definitely a steal of a deal before. Some of my favorite items are the cauli nugs, jackfruit nachos and elotes salad. Pictured is the tofu scramble and biscuits and gravy.",

It\u2019s just so incredibly slow and not attentive. It seems there is a lack of server flow and organization. It looks like they are just running around everywhere rather then having designated sections/tables to focus on. My food has also been made wrong every time I go. I now know to always double check and make sure the food I ordered was in fact made gluten free and dairy free when I receive it. I have no problem advocating for my health and speaking up about my food, but hope that others don\u2019t just blindly trust that their meals are made correctly. With all of that being said, it\u2019s still a new favorite date spot! We hope they have major success and can stick around for a long time!",

The patio space was well laid out and  a good size for our event. It was even covered in case it rained, there was an outside bar and a space for live entertainment. The food was beyond what was expected and beautifully presented. The staff was very helpful and flexible with our requests. I appreciate all their hard work and making the day that much more awesome!  Overall I was sincerely impressed and in future visits will make sure to stop in at the Nightshop.",

They are delicious and served in a good quantity. Also, if you like dark beers, the number 14 in the list is one you must try.  The bar has internal and external area and many darts machines so you can have fun playing it. They also have a karaoke day, so fun.  If you are in Bloomington, IL looking for someplace to drink beers and eat something, this is a very good option.",

Both quality of food and quality in staff is suffering. I believe it appears to be due to high turnover or inconsistent staffing. I am hoping the best for these guys to turn it around and get back to good quality like when they first opened.  Please!!  Original Review: This incredible gem is oddly eclectic in all of the right ways. It's contemporary vibe mixes a bar with dart boards and live music with incredibly polite staff and BLOOMINGTON's Best Vegan menu! You can't go wrong so throw a dart at the menu and order away. My wife and I will be frequent visitors. Fresh fruit, healthy avacado toast, vegan French toast, it's simply all amazing! Calling all vegans and vegetarians, please come and support!!",

The vegan remoulade was surprisingly good. I would tweak a couple of things. I had a spinach and feta hand pie, but it didn't have any feta. It was lacking salt (probably because of the missing feta). The fried Brussels sprouts leaves were pretty tasty but very greasy, and could have used a little more flavor. The cauliflower nuggets could have used more aleppo pepper - the texture was good but they were a bit bland. Service was slower than I anticipated. I will come here again. Everything I had to eat had the potential to be amazing; i'm looking forward to seeing them fine tune their foods.",

This place has great food, full stop -- not just \"great vegan-friendly food.\"  I visited for the first time Friday evening around 5, so too early to experience nightshop as a music venue (there was a metal show scheduled around 8). Started with the fried green beans and a side of housemade ranch sauce for dipping; they were crunchy without being over-breaded and the ranch tasted fresh rather than excessively sweet/heavy like what you get from store-bought. My husband describes them as, \"The most [he's] ever been excited about green beans.\" He got the lamb burger, which was a definite winner, paired with some fries.  I got the seared tuna sandwich, and while the fish itself was good, there was way too much thick bread -- it seemed more meant to accompany a \"wet\" sandwich, like the kind covered in au jus. In this case it just overwhelmed the fish and light vegetables, the bottom half disintegrating after a few bites so I could no longer hold it. I ended up just eating the insides with a fork and leaving the breading behind. The side of fried Brussels sprouts leaves was truly remarkable, with all the can't-have-just-one snackability of a potato chip while also getting my husband to enthusiastically eat a leafy green vegetable. Will reorder those next time with a different entree!  The draft beer list is extensive, and I enjoyed the digital displays showing how close kegs are to blowing and what beers are up next! It feels a bit like a game that way.  We ended up enjoying two beers each and are already planning what we'd like to try off the rest of the food menu when we return! I'm so pleased to have discovered this delightful spot in downtown Bloomington; definitely recommend!",
