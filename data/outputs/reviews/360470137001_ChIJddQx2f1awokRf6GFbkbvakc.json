Just get regular dumplings if you can't eat it at the restaurant! Since we couldn't go to my parents for a Chinese New Year Eveve meal, I took the family to Authentic Szechuan last night for dinner. Since we were eating there, we got to order the soup dumplings (Pork Juicy Pork Bun on the menu) and they were pretty good (not the most soup but still tasty). We ordered a whole bunch of dishes to share.  The stir fried string beans are always a favorite for our kids.  Hands down, the Szechuan food here is the best in the neighborhood (and probably the surrounding neighborhoods). A couple spicy dishes that I recommend are Lamb Hot Sauce Style and the Chong Qing Spicy Chicken. You don't come here for the sushi. Full disclosure, I have never tried the sushi here. We usually get delivery from this place and the food is always solid.",

The food is good but the delivery person is a complete jerk. Why would we pay 15% tip to have him come to the building front desk and then tell us to come down and get it? He lied - he told the front desk he talked to us and that we would come down and get the food. When we said we were not coming down to get it he walked out the door with our food (that we had waited an hour for). Grub Hub was great - they refunded the entire amount.  The only job a delivery person has is to deliver food. I'm happy to pay a 15% tip but all that is required is to press a button, ride an elevator and drop the food off. The time he spent arguing with the front desk - he could have brought the food up. I called the restaurant and let them know.  Don't bother ordering unless you don't plan on tipping. And usually if you don't tip - they will do something to your food. Too bad - I hope the owner takes the time to read this and realize that reviews do impact your business",

Moreover the tasting in the filling was unappetizing with one too many textures of the tough meat in there.  The order also did not include the brown rice that was a specific option we chose under seamless to include with our moo shu veggies.  Also, the sesame noodles did not have any peanut or peanut sauce which is usually a staple when we ordered in the past from other places so we were dissapointed in that.

The food is good, prices are good, and the atmosphere is wonderful. The inside of the restaurant looks great and the seating is very comfortable.  I've tried a fair portion of their huge menu and never been disappointed with the food. The sushi is always half-off so you can easily get 4 or 5 standard rolls for $15 - can't complain about that. Occasionally they will do a $3 special for house red or white wine - deal. I prefer to eat at the restaurant but when I've gotten delivery it has been prompt and friendly.
