Service is fantastic and there's almost zero wait time for calling a server to your table.  Food is excellent and the prices are really low compared to every other sushi place I've been to. Rolls are a solid 9/10 and there's a larger than average menu. Their mochi is delicious, too. I recommend the strawberry and green tea.  They offer deals up to $50 off (though our group bill was below that) after a certain spend. They give you a card to keep track of your visits.",
