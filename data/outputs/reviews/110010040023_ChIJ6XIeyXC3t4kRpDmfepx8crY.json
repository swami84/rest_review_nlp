        "caption": "I ordered the Meat the Press Pizza for $19!!! WOW! What a price for a pizza for one. Now, I will say that it was good, but way overpriced. I have never paid that much for one personal pizza. It was a decent size and the flavor was great. The crust was soft and cooked to a perfect crisp. I went to this restaurant for a work luncheon and was immediately taken by the high class look of the place. The server was very friendly and professional. The menu was easy to read and so were the prices. I do understand that the restaurant is inside the Hilton and in the middle of D.C. but I still can't get over the price. My co-workers had a club sandwich and two burgers and they said that the food was good but the fries are what really stood out. The average was $20 per dish. So, would I go here again for lunch... No, not if I'm buying. I think my pizza should be at least $15, as for everyone else's dish they need to be a lot cheaper. Even though the food tasted good the price needs a lot cheaper, specifically for lunch.",
