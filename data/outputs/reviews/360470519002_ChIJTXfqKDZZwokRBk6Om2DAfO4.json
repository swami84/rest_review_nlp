They also give you a lot of curry so I ended up using the leftover with rice the next day! The papaya salad was pretty good too. I think it was even spicier than the khao soi, but refreshing!

When I arrived to pick up they were finalizing the order - Which I appreciated as this meant the order was not sitting around. I ordered the fried tofu appetizer with peanut sauce, Pad See Ew noodles with chicken and Kra-Pow with shrimp.  The fried tofu and pad see ew noodles were both very bland in flavor. I would not recommend either. The Kra-Pow was decent but not memorable. It was not very spicy and while significantly better than the other two dishes, did not compare favorably to the same dish I have had at other Thai restaurants.  Given the exceptional overall rating on Google (4.9 stars) I expected much better.",
