The owners Tara and Tony, and their daughter Itxaso, were very welcoming, warm, and friendly and made sure everything was perfect.  We had pinchos, the croquetas, the paella, and the green peppers, and everything was delicious! They also have a great selection of wines by the glass that went extremely well with the food. They also have wine bottles at great prices, which you can either buy to go or drink them on site after you pay a reasonable corkage fee, which we did.  Overall, this was a fantastic experience and can\u2019t wait to visit again!",

Appetizers we had the Olive dip, the cheese dip and then this really good bacon sweet paradise dip that they made especially for that day, I think it contained goat cheese. Oh my goodness with the baguette it was wonderful.  For the main course. Braised pork loin you can see the picture it was topped with a great balsamic vinegar and it was delicious.
