Owner/Mgr Francisco was rude AF to my wife when at leaving and paying the bill she mentioned that our app came out cold...we didn't even send it back cause felt bad for businesses during these lockdowns. We've either dinned in or ordered out from here 20 or so times, but will never do so again. The hostess/bartender/waitress wearing multiple hats was the only redeeming quality about the joint. ............. Update dropping from 5 to 3: I have been for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it, however I did a take order for dinner recently and it left a lot to be desired. We ordered the burger and chicken sandwich and both were just Okay - mediocre at best. Both Items seem like they come prepackaged and are just heated up. The chicken is pre-breaded and then fried and the burger patty comes already made and then just put it on the grill like a fast food place. The fries, both potato and sweet potato, were good, but I won't be ordering either of these items again. The pasta is good from experience - so go there for that, but SkyTown, across the street has Far Better sandwiches.",

Often times though, I find that those are the places that make the best dining experiences. This is no exception, with its ample menu full of American-style to Italian-style cuisine and everything in between, you too will have fun trying to pair the best meal with the best extravagant cocktail. The spot also boasted live music pre-Covid era and as she, the owner, explained to me upon exiting, if you like music with reggae ska vibes then check out #eyespynowifi a local Brooklyn band that performed there regularly. Now for me, there's nothing better than having a soundtrack with your eats!",

It\u2019s amazing how fast their able to cook great food at such a fast pace. My son and husband ordered burgers and I ordered the chicken sandwich. My sandwich was full of flavor. Topped with a slaw, onions, tomatoes, and honey mustard. My side order of French fries were  amazing. (I consider myself a French Fry connoisseur.) Portions are a nice size. I paired my sandwich with a their Etna bianco. Great food and service!!!",

I hope to return and find the same service. Thank you very much for the birthday note and the gift bag !!  (Original) El lugar es muy bonito, el ambiente bueno , es la segunda vez que estoy aqu\u00ed, la primera no ,nos fue tambi\u00e9n con el servicio , pero esta fue de primera, Tome las hamburguesitas vegana y papas fritas , yogurt con fresas y granola, todo muy sabroso y calentito,  ( que es lo que pido de mis alimentos ,que se sientan que los acaban de hacer y que no son calentados en microondas , para eso como en casa), los precios, $$ arriba , pero el lugar , la comida y las porciones lo valen . Espero regresar y encontrarme con el mismo servicio. Muchas gracias por la nota de cumplea\u00f1os y la bolsa de regalos!!.",

The food and service can either be great, or it can be hit or miss, or it can just be closed.  I\u2019ve come here a few times where they were closed by 8pm because they sold out of food.  I\u2019ve come here before for a delicious pasta and sandwich and cocktail.  I\u2019ve also come here when the waitress forgot our drink order completely, then served us kinda cold burgers, then got the side orders wrong, and that was a $70 bill.  So, it\u2019s ambitious for Brooklyn- to bring well priced, well designed elegant dining to the neighborhood.  4 stars for effort. Just wish it could be run more consistent, and less Brooklyn lackadaisical!",
