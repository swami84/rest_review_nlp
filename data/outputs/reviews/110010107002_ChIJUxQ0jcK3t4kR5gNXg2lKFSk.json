Inside is the main bar and center of it all- where the magic happens. Downstairs takes you into a cool, speak-easy vibe. You get a feel for everything at Residents. The aesthetic, atmosphere, energy and above all\u2014 the employees are fantastic. I feel at home every time I walk in. Must see, must try!",

Hype brings more people, and servers become overwhelmed as service and your experience quality decreases accordingly. 2. They remove dishes from their menu based on season, including the hyped up signature dishes that have excited people. So that in my mind could be a setback.  I recommend this place for a lovely brunch and a cocktail. They seem very attentive, service is not slow per reduced capacity. The food is meticulously prepared and looks appetizing. I enjoyed their Mediterranean dishes which are prepared with nice spices and are delicious.",

The ambiance is calming and welcoming. I\u2019ve been struggling to find a place where I could dine outside AND have a nice, cozy environment. Oh, and especially one that\u2019s warm-ish in this frigid winter!! Look no more. Residents has the most beautiful set up and for a split second, I felt like I was on a European vacation with friends.  Next up, the drinks. Oh, boy the drinks. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t intend on drinking but they are too delicious to pass up. I had a nonalcoholic espresso martini which was everything I needed in this world. Wish I could have one of these every morning. The Quince was the star of the show. My friends each got one, and we were not disappointed. It was a delicious blend of a whiskey sour and a hot toddy as one described it. We also had the matcha tea, glass of champagne, cranberry seasonal cocktail, and ginger seasonal cocktail - all so tasty.  Now the food... oh my goodness the food!! We got the smashed avocado toast, market plate, and carbonara - added meat to all of them. I was so happy with my avocado smash but needed to have a bit from everyone\u2019s dish. The food is sourced locally so everything tastes incredibly fresh and filled with bold tastes. My goodness, I did not expect that I\u2019d eat so much. We even ordered the toasted pumpkin bread for dessert. For the record, I hate pumpkin everything but bc I trusted what this place was doing, I had to try it when Debbie (best server ever) brought it out. Let\u2019s just say no crumbs were left behind.  And finally, my experience would have been great but it was elevated by both Debbie and Moody. Two genuine people who truly enjoy their job. Both so personable, filled with wittiness and kindness. If you get them as your servers, please take care of them - I promise they\u2019ll go above and beyond for you!",

We made reservations for 8PM and arrived a few minutes early. We notified the host upon arrival and watched 3 or 4 groups get seated before we were finally seated at around 8:20. Maybe they had reservations as well, IDK but there seemed to be some tables open during our wait.  We ordered everything at once, apps, drinks and entrees and was delighted the apps came out within 10 minutes, so far so good... another 30 minutes go by, our server Moody who was awesome, suggest more drinks we oblige but still not entrees. Another 30 minutes go by still no entrees, more drink suggestions we declined. I literally walk to Shack Shack down the street to get food after waiting around 1:15 minutes between our apps and entrees. To clarify one of those entrees was a salad!!! I honestly was starving which is why I left and came back to find out entrees, which by the way are tiny portions and over priced. Our server credited a couple drinks and really tried his best to make it make sense. Ultimately we made reservations for 8PM for seated at 8:20, apps within 10 minutes and entrees came out close to 10PM. If it wasn\u2019t for our server we all would\u2019ve grabbed the check and left.  Maybe this is an isolated incident and honestly the food was flavorful. Regardless between the wait, the portions size and prices I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be stopping in again.",

The delicious cocktails certainly played into that vibe. I had a passion fruit mojito even though it was not listed on the menu. It was excellent and had the perfect amount of lime. For brunch, I had the Turkish Eggs as my main dish. The garlic labneh was a great touch and the spices were perfect. One of the best new brunch dishes I have had in a long time and very original. For dessert, we shared 2 banana breads with the table. I really underestimated how good they would end up being. It was warm and crispy on the outside and has somewhat of a bread pudding/french toast texture to it. My wife had the breakfast sandwich which she raved about and her mother had the feta watermelon salad which she said was super refreshing. Can't wait to go back to try more. I was also sad to hear they were out of the basque cheesecake and I am looking forward to trying that next time because anything with passion fruit is up my alley.",

When the sun came out, a waiter (without a mask) brought several table parasols to the patio for customers who were exposed directly to the strong sunlight. There was one parasol near us, though, covering a vacant table saved intentionally for social distancing. The light was shining into our eyes. We made several attempts to bring the heavy parasol towards us. A waiter who stood 6 feet away from us set up and adjusted another parasol to the benefit of certain other customers, but did not offer to help to us.  Towards noon, the sunlight moved away from our area and towards another area of the patio. Another waiter asked the guests of a table nearby for permission to move their parasol to that area but they said that they preferred to keep it. Then he simply took our parasol away, without asking. (We would have given permission anyway, had he asked.)  The food and cocktails were good, but we don\u2019t know why the waiters were so conspicuously dismissive of and passive-aggressive towards us in particular. The service should be improved.",

The patio gives strong Mediterranean vibes with the palms and furnishings.  My favorite part about Residents is the music, its the x factor that pushes the experience to next level, it more or less transports me to another place for the time that I am there.  The mid tempo house tunes give me feelings of being at a posh resort. The food and cocktail menu are backed with amazing service from an eager staff that are just as courteous as they are attentive.  Reservations are recommended because patio space is limited and I have highlighted some of my favorite dishes in pictures: watermelon salad, schnitzel and tagliatelle.  If you are not dining, stop by for one of their signature espresso martinis, made with espresso that its brewed to order, they don't disappoint.",

I was having a rather stressful morning, walked in, spent 10 minutes at this place and walked out completely calm and refreshed. The place has an intimate atmosphere, with about 8 bar stools and 4 small tables with plushy seats. More pillows and blanket are waiting on the shelf to be grabbed, if you want to literally curl up wrapped in a blanket. Quiet and pleasant soundtrack playing in the background. Clean, neat. Friendly, charming barista Natasha lights up the place with her smile. This place feels to comfortable, like you've been invited into someone's home - someone who knows you need a moment of peace and quiet. That being said, the cappuccino for 3.75 was perfect. Not bitter, not sour. Just right. Excellent foam. And, without being asked, Natasha gave me a glass of water for the cappuccino, which is a really classy gesture for a barista. Really common for Europe and so common for the US. I'm definitely coming back to this charming place.",

In the evening, it becomes a cocktail bar with food.  To start, the space is beautiful. It's simply decorated and it works. There's patio seating in the front. If you sit at the bar, you'll enjoy the views no matter where you turn. It's a cute space.  The service is impeccable. The bartender was friendly and quickly made us quality drinks and food. My spritz was excellent, refreshing, and large.  The fries were perfectly cooked as well as the avocado chiccette. I'd go back for sure!",
