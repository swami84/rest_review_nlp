I get that it\u2019s covid times and taking food to go isn\u2019t the same as eating in the restaurant, but I have to post about our take out from tonight. The whole seafood boil was over cooked. The potatoes were mush and the corn was disgusting. The head on shrimp survived but was still over cooked. The snow crab legs were basically inedible. They were extremely over cooked. The shell was so bendy you could bend them in half and they wouldn\u2019t break. The sauce was basically just oil. If you want to take home a seafood boil go to Low Country or Asian Cajun. We\u2019ve had take out from both of those multiple times during covid and it\u2019s just like eating in the restaurant!",

The seafood was cooked great, the flavors were spot on, the drinks were just as great, if not better.. i think I'd drive back to The Crab Pad just for their tea with chia seeds! The ice cream and the flavors were so hard to choose from but make sure you leave space in your belly for an ice cream with unlimited toppings!

A few days ago I drove 45 minutes to get two seafood bags and made it all the way back home only to be very disappointed with my order. My food was bland. One bag was drenched in butter and the other bag barely had any liquid in it at all. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know that I was not satisfied with the food I spent almost $100 on and drove 45 minutes for. The host was the only person I was in communication with and she let me know the kitchen said it wasn\u2019t their fault my food was bland and I shouldn\u2019t have made modifications to my order. Also, the manager told her to offer me a jar of sauce for my inconvenience. A $10 jar of sauce. The next day the host (still not communication with the manager) offered me a discount on my next order so I guess I\u2019m expected to spend MORE money and hope they get the next order correct. That sucks because I literally love this place and I was trying to support the restaurants I love during this pandemic while we\u2019re watching so many businesses close their doors.

The staff went WAYY above and beyond, they worked with us to make everything perfect, and it was freaking phenomenal. We got more compliments than we could count for hosting there, and it was 10000% because of the the staff.  (Fun fact: this event was my wedding.) Obviously go for the crab (partial to snow and blue myself), but don't ever sleep on the garlic noodles. Pro tip: toss some of the seafood seasoning in with the noodles if you want some spice.  SO GOOD. This place is unreal, and I would give it unlimited stars if I could. All of my love.",

It was great to share a table with my old friends and make new ones.  We started off with a choice of limeade juice boxes of several flavors from the Crab Pad, which were then made into adults only juice boxes by adding a shot of rum or vodka.  The restaurant is BYOB, this was special just for us.  We had our own long table, and when they started to pile food on the table, no one knew just what to expect next.  The rice, corn, potatoes, sausage and green beans were plentiful and more than enough for everyone.  We each received a bag full of shrimp, crawfish and crab legs, with your choice of mild, medium or spicy seasonings.  You will be able to choose your own combination from the menu.  At the end of the evening, we were treated to ice cream bars from Milk & Wood.  You pick a flavorful bar, drizzle it with syrup and top it off with your choice of 9 different toppings.  There were some very unusual flavors, but, I had the mint oreo bar.  This was a wonderful dessert, and will be a great treat on a warm weather day.  Theresa the owner was a wonderful hostess and made sure everyone had enough food and drinks flowing throughout the evening.  I highly recommend the Crab Pad, the food is delicious, prices are reasonable, the owner is awesome and the service can't be beat.  Yes, we got crabs in Chicago at the Crab Pad and they were delicious, and we also got shrimp and crawfish too!",

I also would like to mention. I did not get a receipt with my order, meaning WHAT was my order about. The guy politely handed me the bag with 2 plastic bags. I thought each is going to be different. Instead, they put my 2lb shrimps with the snow crab legs. Mussels were together with the crawfish. He did not even mention about what my order was about, not to mention the quantity. I even tend to think that it was WAY less than I ordered. The food in general was ok, but way too HOT (and I love spicy and hot food), but even for me that was a little too much. With that being said, I will not go back nor I will recommend this place. Thanks",

It has so many things going for it - arcade machine while you wait, byob with a fantastic beer shop a few doors down that delivers to your table, great service, quirky wall art. However, from a food perspective, expect to pay a lot to still be hungry. I got a pound of snow crab legs, which tasted absolutely fantastic, but I don't understand where they found crabs with so little meat. They had about half the meat you'd expect in each piece, so most of the weight ended up being shell. Fortunately they had a wing special when I was there so I was able to have a full meal, but it wasn't what I would consider value when you're paying $28 for a pound of crab legs.",

We order two bags and they put the wrong items in the wrong bag/sauce.  For 5 adults, eating out of a plastic bag, we spent $200.

NO way around that, but it is so worth it and I believe that's part of what makes it so great. So don't go there on a first date, it won't end well. That being said, the food is out of this world. It may be a little pricey, but it's sea food in Chicago, and for what you get, it's well worth it. The whole shrimp was my favorite, but everything was outstanding. Solid desert as well! The staff was very kind and helpful, and you can't beat BYOB. I can not wait to return to this place.",

As for the seafood, the shrimp seemed like a better value as the clam shells account for most of the weight when ordering by the pound. The staff was friendly and the BYOB was a plus.",

My son added the spaghetti to the order, I was so pleased with the end result.  It can be very messy, the hand sink in the dining room is a smart amenity.  I'm not sure about the prices, I'm not familiar with the scale.  The Popsicle dessert option was cool too.  I was there during the day when there were only four tables, and it was open for about one week.  My server was MIA for a bit, she was on her phone within eyesight so I knew she was close by despite being into her social media.  That was minor.  I fully expect I will be back, with a seafood loving crowd.",
