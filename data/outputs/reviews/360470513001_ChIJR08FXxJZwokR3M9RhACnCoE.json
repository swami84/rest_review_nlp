One waiter even lost his patience when I asked about the status of the udons and the other appetizer they had forgotten about, and we only asked once. Later he apologized to me, probably realizing his misstep. I\u2019m giving it one more star only because I can tell they\u2019re really understaffed and this is a difficult time for restaurants in general.  We arrived around 7:20 and put in our order around 7:30. The first appetizer, tamago, arrived promptly. Flavor was good and the presentation was lovely. We now put in another appetizer order, tempura, and they apparently didn\u2019t put it in. We waited until 8:20 and noticed that the waiters had not come to patio with food or even come at all for a while, so we presumed they were tied up.  At 8:30 I went in and asked about the status, a waiter told me that there were still two orders before us and it usually took around an hour for udon to be ready around dinner time.  An hour to fulfill an udon order is normal - is that what you mean? And if you told us that when we ordered, do you think we would have stayed for dinner?  I\u2019d think udon broth is mostly precooked. What step in udon preparing would take an hour to complete? I can only presume they handle takeout and dine-in order altogether, which is bad management and I don\u2019t think they deserve the benefit of doubt.  I then asked about the other appetizer order we put in. He didn\u2019t answer directly and it was not on the order ticket he showed me. He went in and checked with the waitress we put in the order with.  So I waited for him to come back, while waiting for the bathroom. Another waiter checked in with me. I told him I was waiting about the status of our order. He snapped and said he \u201calready\u201d told my friends that it was a full house tonight.  Hello? I was not at the table when you updated the status with my friends, was I?  A minute later he circled back with me and apologized, saying again it\u2019s a full house.  At 8:40, we got our other appetizer, the tempura. Flavor was good, but nothing worth waiting an hour for. And apparently it took less than 10 minutes to prepare since they added the order. Around 8:45, we finally got our udons. Right after, all the people that came in after 8 got their orders too.  Udons were overcooked. We got Kitsune Udon, Tori & Kinok Udon, and Niku Udon. Maybe it\u2019s different preference, but growing up in Taiwan and been to Japan a few times, I prefer udons to have some kind of al dente texture. The only thing I was delighted about my kitsune udon was the sharpness from the thin peels of yuzu.  I really wanted to like Hanon. They have such a cute backyard and you can tell the owners put a lot of thoughts into the restaurant. They dining ware was very sophisticated and they kept the tables far apart. Still, very disappointed. Not sure if I\u2019ll ever come back. My friends said udon at Raku is way better.",

I had seen on Yelp the cold udon, so I wanted that. We both ended up getting the cold dipping noodle with duck, and our orders came out quite quickly. The noodles are delicious, perfectly chewy and awesome. The soup was mediocre as it just tasted like diluted soy sauce, and the duck was quite terrible. There was some weird coating outside the duck that made it taste really bad, and there wasn't much flavor to it. I could tell the duck was probably sitting out for a while, and it was really bad. I would not recommend the duck at all. If not for the duck, I would've given this spot 5 stars, but the duck was bad enough to ruin my meal that I do not want to come back (and it's also what made my meal so expensive). A normal dipping sauce is $10 pre-tax pre-tip, the duck dipping soup was $18 pre-tax pre-tip. Paying $8 (and then some for tax and tip) for 4 pieces of really bad duck was not good. The amount of food was good, but I just really did not enjoy the duck. Service was also quite pleasant, as the waiters were friendly, approachable, and prompt in refilling our waters and clearing our plates.",

They didn't even mention it until we asked where a layer of our cake was. In my opinion, if you mess up this bad, you should offer something as a courtesy. Maybe don't charge us $50 for cutting a cake and then throwing away 25% of it. They offered us more dessert which we clearly didn't need.  Go for the dipping udon, skip the rice dishes.

The Octopus and Avocado salad was good with decent amount of octopus and good size chunks of avocado; the dressing was just right.  The service could not have been better and the space is simple and comfortable. They have patio, but I think it's only for warmer weather.  Overall, I will not repeat. We went to Raku Soho the week before, which we liked a lot more in terms of quality, quantity, and price if food, but their staff can use a lot of cleaning up. Merge the Hanon staff with Raku menu and I think you have a very good restaurant.  Hanon takes reservations, but plan a day or two in advance.",

The udon with beef-curry broth was awesome, I recommend extra noodles every time.  I don\u2019t believe they except reservations ahead so expect a little bit of a wait. If you need to, Montesacro and Barcade right next door are perfect to kill time. Only thing that would make this place better is a liquor license. TBD I hope",

I really enjoyed the chewy bite of the udon. Honestly, I can't tell the difference in taste (newb palette) but it's interesting to say the least.  The place is certainly worth another visit. I will get the soup next time.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the tendon. The whole point tempura is the crispy tempura batter. The tendon tempura was unfortunately dipped or spent too much time in sauce, making the batter soggy. Would be significantly better if the sauce was put on top of the bed of rice first then have the tempura drizzled with sauce instead. Maybe this is a regional thing?",

Unfortunately, the tempura in the tendon was completely soggy which negates the very point of tempura! Also no less than 5 different waiters waited on us at different points throughout the meal which was weird. All in all, this place has potential but I was disappointed to give away $19 for soggy tempura on rice.",

I love noodles, and this udon place definitely has caught my attention. Has great atmosphere/abivence. I had ordered one of their chilled udon sets and it was certainly a different dining experience. Most times, I perfer hot udon in broth. But today I wanted something cooler to counter the NY spring heat. Perfect choice. You get a plate of freshly made noodles (chilled) and you soak your noodles in the broth/sauce they give you and eat. Not to be mistaken as a broth, the sauce was flavorful and impactful without being too saturated with odd flavors. I do admit, I was a bit sad that the tempura wasn't alot bigger, cause I loveee tempura but! The tempura was light and fluffy as it should be and it was just enough to fill me. 5/5 will go again.",

Some baby bok choi with the kakiage udon for a touch of grassy bitterness; or a bit of lemon zest in the kitsune udon. Lemon zest in the broth of the kitsune udon! It\u2019s transcendental.",
