The pizza is a bit different than what you would typically expect, but it was absolutely delicious.  It reminded me of french bread pizza, but replace the french bread with an airy rosemary focaccia and you have an idea of what to expect.  We also tried the calamari, which despite not always being a dish that travels well (via takeout or delivery), was delicious and had a perfect light breading on it.  Dessert was great too, though we can't wait to try the gelato once they're making it again.  Customer service was great as well.  Highly recommend trying out this hidden neighborhood spot!",

Even though we are regulars, whenever we bring friends or a group, the staff treats them all just as well as us, and the service is always great.

Sauces' integrity are kept intact and compliment just about every dish on the menu.  The wine list is superb yet straightforward.  It amazes me how Sorriso keeps their prices so affordable.  If this is your first time and you are an epicure looking for your  Italian food paradise, look no further. If you are a repeat customer, the menu allows you enough tantalizingly delicious choices for yout to explore time and time over again.  Here is a secret: ask for the Nutella pizza for dessert.  It will change your life and leave your speechless.  The owner and staff are very down to earth, unpretentious, and will create a personalized experience for you.  If you are looking for a cookie-cutter Italian experience, please move on because you will not appreciate this jewel and this place is not for you.",

After so many great experiences in restaurants, in many countries around the world during our trip around the world, our last dinner was at Sorriso Restaurant. It was terrible. The food was mediocre and the portions were very small, the pizza was dry. After we told the manager about this his reaction was really rude. He told us he never had any complaints before, but after we checked on the internet, we easily found a lot of negative reviews.Our advice: DONT GO HERE!!.",

She led us upstairs and to the back next to a window. It would seem that all the table are secluded, even though the restaurant is quite open. I had the pizza Diavola with house red wine and my friend ordered chicken cacciatore-- an off menu item the waitress was happy to comply with-- and a Riesling. The food was excellent and even the house wine was enjoyable. Our waitress was attentive without being overly so. We will definitely go back and urge anyone who has not gone yet to go.",
