        "caption": "First and foremost, if I could rate the services received, or lack thereof rather, I would! I ordered food from this establishment via Eat24 at 7:21pm! The ETA was about 45-50min. Understandable! I called the at 8:30  explaining that it's been over an hour and I hadn't received my food. He explained that the food had been picked up a while ago and should be on it's way within another 5min. 8:45 comes and still no food. At this point the delivery guy calls and explains he's lost and can't find me. I explained to him exactly where I was located and also gave him landmarks to help him out. He said ok I'm around the corner and I'll be there in 10min. 10min comes and goes and still no food! Now I'm speaking to a woman who's explaining to me that the delivery guy is lost and needs my exact location. I explained to her that I went through that with the delivery guy already.....TWICE mind you, each time with him sounding agitated, and each time he hung up while I was in mid conversation. The woman explains that he doesn't speak English. I say to her \"well ma'am I don't mean yo come off rude, but that's not my problem nor is it my fault for him being well over an hour late!\" She agrees with what I'm saying and says she'll call him and call me back (after I've now given her the address and landmarks to where I'm located). She calls back and explains that he's around the corner and will be there momentarily. At this point it's been beyond 2hrs and I have yet to receive my food. I call and ask to speak with the manager because I want my order canceled! She laughs and says ok then hangs up the phone. I then call back and demand to speak to the manager again. She says \"you want to talk to the manager, call the delivery guy and ask for his information!\" I then say to her \"the same delivery guy who doesn't speak English\" She says yes and hangs up again! At this point I am beyond agitated! I call back for a third and final time and explain to her that I am very displeased and want my money transferred back into my account! She gives me the run around (after yelling of course in her native tongue) and hangs up! I then contact the restaurant directly and explain to them that I'm displeased with the services that I have received and want my money back! I also asked for his name in which he says \"No\" I say \"Ok so your name is No? may you please spell that!\" In which he days \"Sure, N-O\" It was only after I explained to \"No\" that I am in fact a Special Police Officer and I will be expecting to receive my funds returned to my account that he finally took me seriously! Only then did I receive respect and answers and call-backs assuring that things will be handled. It should not have gotten that far for this organization to be remorseful. I will NOT recommend this organization to anyone else! Thankfully the representatives at Eat24 felt compassionate enough to refund my money (so they say). We will see how that turns out when I actually receive it! In closing, this was my personal experience, in which we are all entitled to express. I pray the next person's experience is a lot better than mine!",

I ordered spicy crunchy salmon rolls as well and was very displeased when they showed up as spicy salmon avocado rolls. When I called to alert them of the error they told me that they put avocado in there for me and that they were crunchy. After eating two and proving to myself that I was not crazy and they were in fact not crunchy, I called again. The replacement rolls (free) arrived 30 minutes later. They were bad as well. Avocado (which I did not ask for) was brown and they were the same as before, not crunchy, with tempura flakes sitting on top of the rolls. Overall, I was not pleased. I must say that although the pork fired rice was good I will not be ordering from here again. Bad service, bad food quality.",
