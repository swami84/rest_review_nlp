At that point, I knew my meal would not be disappointing. I ordered the Torta de Milanesa. A breaded chicken sandwich. The first bite did it.

I did not ask but it looks like the tortillas were handmade. Carnitas were excellent, perfect cooking and flavor. The taco al pastor did not dissapoint either. Guacamole was also very good. They could bring a little bit more salsa, but I know I eat more salsa than regular people  lol The curros were not like regular churros, these were fluffy and soft. I really loved them! Even though they were already cold :(  They can improve service speed. It was slow, very slow :( maybe because it was Sunday evening? I saw my churros ready to be delivered to my table for 10 minutes. But definetly I will come back and maybe I will sit at the bar instead",

The whole atmosphere when you walk in is light and beautiful, really adding to the experience.  Highlights for me: pescado taco, elote, chips and guacamole.  All of the food was good, but to elevate just a bit more, I\u2019d change a few small things. The pozole was good, but a bit too spicy to eat. It would be very nice complemented with a tortilla or type of bread, still staying true to Mexican cuisine. Also, the two meat tacos - I would\u2019ve preferred just a bit less meat and more condiments to compliment the tastes.  Excellent service, which is always appreciated. The server we had clearly loved the restaurant and was able to genuinely give recommendations and information about the menu. Always a plus.  Pricing: to me, pretty reasonable, especially for NYC. You can get plenty of food for $10-15 if that\u2019s what you want to shoot for. 3 tacos is $12.  Will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to others!

Octopus is delicious and the tacos -- while pricier than what you would get at some local storefront taquerias -- are supertasty.  Overall good prices and even better food.  Service is nice too.",

Totally worth ordering! And if you want a nice drink that remimds you of the autumn or winter, taste the Spiced Sangria. It's topped with apple chucks and a dash of cinnamon. I loved the food and drink...perfect combination. The adventure of flavors doesn't stop there, make room for dessert! The CHURROS are the perfect balance of crunchy sugary outside and soft inside. The cinnamon caramel dip is AMAZING!  The lunch staff is friendly with attention to detail. WHY 3 STARS \ud83c\udf1f: The reason for 3 stars instead of a higher rating is due to the inconsistency of the overall experience which didn't carry over when I visited during evening shift. The Spices Sangria taste 1,000 times better during lunch time and please note the The Bowl is only served at lunch. See picts!",

The salsa was too spicey though. And i like spicey.  The skate ceviche i found a bit bland. Served with plantains (carribbean style vs pacific style) but beautifully presented.  Full of green chilis. Interesting how some chefs want to kill you.  I ordered the fish tacos (fried), the mole (on chicken) and the barbacoa.  All bland.  Sorry!  The mile is a sauce poured over shredded chicken.  When the meat is cooked separately from the sauce then u don't get that amazing combination of juices (animal fat) mixing together.  The fish taco - you usually taste just the fried.  I didn't taste either. The barbacoa was my favorite and usually it is my least. But all beautifully presented. Womp womp. I will say this:  some of the best tortillas in nyc.  They do tortillas right!",

I think I just ordered the wrong thing this time; my son's tacos looked (and were) delicious.  Note to chef:  Tinker with the empanadas a bit, and please NOTE ON THE MENU WHAT KINDS OF FLOUR ARE USED...SOME PEOPLE ARE WHEAT INTOLERANT AND/OR DIABETIC -- corn flour kinder to the body than wheat flour.

Served in a taco made with one of the best homemade tortillas I've had and it's a phenomenal dish I'm still dreaming about 36 hours later. The barbacoa taco is very remarkable too; barbacoa being one of my family's mainstays, I've got a wide frame of reference. Oso's is successfully succulent, savory, and soft to the palate -- one inhales it and quickly orders seconds. To round out my taco order: lengua -- a delicate option only attempted by a bold Mexican restaurant -- and Oso's interpretation does not disappoint. A wonderful marriage of flavors both sweet and savory are driven home with a unique tenderness that almost melts in your mouth. As an appetizer I had the pozole verde and it was quite tasty, refreshing, and satisfying. To round out my meal, the intricate Coup de Khan cocktail provided a smoky, sweet, and sour refresher. Others in my brunch group ordered the enchiladas, chilaquiles rojos, and quesadillas and were all very, very content. One person even managed to have room for dessert and had a very enviable order of churros I hope to get next visit. You know a meal is amazing when no one says anything because they're busy eating. Thank you for a great meal, Oso.",

Everyone who knows me, knows how I feel about open air kitchen concept. Once you walk in, you have the choice to sit at the regular tables or the high table with stools. I came during lunch time so I tried the tacos (3 for $12). I had the shrimp, beef and pork. Amazingly delicious and most importantly authentic Mexican cuisine! We shared the Elote and ended up having to get seconds because the corn was sooo good with the chipotle aioli and cotija cheese. So I want to say, if you're in need of a well made margarita come here. If you're feeling extra spontaneous order the guava margarita. My experience all in all was great. It's very rare to find a place that makes excellent food as well as cocktails. I am a stickler for well made cocktails and they definitely have my approval. I will be coming here whenever I'm in the area. This neighborhood was in dire need of something like this. Thank you.",

I am not a fan of chocolate sauce, but the one that was served with the churros was excellent.  My 8yo commented on the open kitchen concept.   He felt it was like watching an episode of \"Chopped\" on the Food Network.  What makes this restaurant stand out was the pacing of our meal.  We were not rushed by wait staff.

The Fish of the Day (Pescado del Dia) Taco left much to be desired; although it was dressed up nicely, it was lacking flavor. The Barbacoa Taco was decent once I squeezed a little lime on it. The guacamole was served with fresh tortilla chips; the guacamole by itself was very fresh but very basic however by adding the combination of the chips, it tasted much better.

For now, it's a well-kept secret, a gem in the heart of an already fantastic neighborhood, and the kind of place that exudes warmth and friendliness--whether you sidle up to the bar for late night cocktails, or grab a group for a celebratory meal! Mark my words, though...it won't be a secret for long.  Pro-tip: come hungry and do the menu up right. Start with some house-made guacamole and tortilla chips while you deliberate, begin with a salad and a couple tacos as appetizers (they're perfect to whet your appetite for what's next), and dig into the real stars of the menu--the entre\u00e9 section! The guava glazed ribs with pickled veggies go perfectly with a side of the Elote (street corn), or grab a whole fish of the day! (Ask your server to deep-fry the spine when you're finished. You'll get major foodie points for being in the know...) The evening would not be complete without having a Crema Mezcal and the Mexican Brownie with Horchata ice cream for dessert.  Also--the cocktail program here is SICK. If you want a fantastic spin on a classic cocktail, the menu will not disappoint. If you want to be the coolest person in your friend group...start building your knowledge of Tequila and Mezcal. You can take a top-shelf or basic flight in either, and the prices are really reasonable.  All in all: the music and ambience in this place are awesome, the food tastes as close to the streets of Mexico City as you'll find around NYC, everything in this spot is made from scratch, and when you're hanging at Oso--it's always a good time.",
