I was asked by the bartender if I was ordering food and I responded no. He then asked me again and I responded that I was with the group having the event. He gave me a glass of water and I returned to my friends.  A few minutes later, he approaches my friends and asks them if I am with them. They reply yes and he asks them again. Other people at the event respond that I am with the group. I'm not sure why the bartender singled me out among the entire party, but the encounter left me feeling uncomfortable as the only person of color in my party.  The food was okay, but I would recommend that the restaurant work on their personnel and provide more interpersonal communication/diversity training. I've never experienced such behavior from restaurant staff in the entire DC area.",

Granted, it was early in the evening, 5ish, but we sat right down, ordered and our food was out in minutes. Wife and kid always get the Pad See Ew and they loved it. I'm the kind that chooses something different, this time I got the Pineapple Fried Rice with pork and it was delicious. So much food, couldn't fit in dessert.
