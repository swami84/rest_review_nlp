Within 30 minutes, he not only arrived with the fries, but he also gave me, for free, three of those heavenly cookies\u2014a really kind gesture to help make things right. (He already had me at the personal delivery, of course. But I admit, the cookies were a really nice and much-appreciated touch.)  Well, if there\u2019s one thing I love, it\u2019s great service, so American Vegan can count me as their newest fan.  Give this restaurant your business: they deserve it.

Guy poured a bunch of agave syrup in the smoothie to make it sweeter even though it wasn't in the ingredients and I didn't ask for it. The consistency was more like a juice.

The food is amazing and worth the wait (everything is made to order). I haven't had their smoothies, salads, or desserts yet, but the buffalo \"chicken\" sandwich and the Beyond Meat and red quinoa burgers are beyond satisfying, as are their waffle fries!  The staff is all very kind and friendly, too. This has become my new go-to spot, especially when I get home late from a long day at work. Soooo glad they are here!!!! Please support them so they can stay on Vanderbilt forever!!!",

I went there with my family as a special night out, we decided to go to American Vegan since we have had it and it has been pretty good before. Anyway we waited 50 minutes for our food. 50 minutes! For whatever reason my order was wrong and on top of that their \"Crispy Chicken Sandwich\" Was legit MorningStar Veggie pattys. The fries were seemingly old and re cooked. They tasted burnt. When its good its great! Its really good if you are Vegetarian/Vegan, this is a good spot when the service is better. They really need to improve their service. The other times I have been there I have ordered the Veggie Burger and it is really good. I would give it a 2/5 out of 5 but I'm pretty sure you can't do that on Google Maps.",

The gf bun didn\u2019t crumble to bits when I took a bite of that giant burger. The SP fries were cooked in maple syrup and cinnamon, from what I could tell. It made for a phenomenal pairing with ketchup. The smoothie was a bit watery at first, but delicious. The man offered to remake it. I hadn\u2019t said anything but he could tell somehow. Prices are pretty standard. I hope to get back to try other items.  Only downsides are: No signage outside made it hard to find & might be why it\u2019s not super busy (though it was a Wednesday evening), bathroom lock doesn\u2019t really work so well, but there is a bathroom!",

They always ask if a smoothie juice or food is okay and will make it over if you\u2019re not satisfied . It gets kind of busy in there which is understandable because it\u2019s really good so it\u2019s worth the wait if you do have to wait. The staff is really respectful they always have base options such as Coconut milk , Almond milk , Soy milk , etc. Food is never cold and it\u2019s child friendly. Their smoothies are really really good especially the Purple Amazon. So far I had the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich, beyond burger , waffle fries , sweet potato waffle fries , a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl , bratwurst sausage and I\u2019m ready to try more . They never disappoint I recommend this place to anyone vegan or going vegan very clean and did I mention the staff is friendly engaged in conversation with them, great people.",

First off, you can\u2019t call a restaurant vegan if you are serving cheddar cheese on your burgers. Secondly, the service here sucks. I ordered a veggie burger, while I waited I noticed the servers forgetting people\u2019s orders and telling them what they ran out of. My husband brought a smoothie and the only options they had was grapefruit or almond milk as the base. Now if this was a true vegan restaurant they would know that there are way more options as a base for a smoothie. When the smoothie came it was bitter and tasted like they put grapefruit only. A waiter came towards us with a bag then she said oh sorry this is not your order. She went to the back and told the chef that we were waiting for our food and the chef told her that she never gave him the order so he never started to cook our food. While waiting, I watched one of the workers go to the store because they ran out of kale. She came back with BAGGED KALE. This is a big no no for me because bagged kale is unhealthy and any true vegan would know that. She brought it, put it in a bowl and began to make a smoothie with it without washing it. When I finally got my burger, I took a bite and it was cold. This restaurant not only has poor customer service, they also need to educate themselves on the true meaning of vegan and the care and thought it takes to have an authentic vegan restaurant. I\u2019m not sure if this place is new but I hope they get it together soon because people will give them a chance once but will never come back.",
