It depends on the staff how strict they want to ensure the safety of themselves and others.  I didn\u2019t get temp checked while others got tested.  The tables were not effectively cleaned after the other guests.  The few squirts of disinfectant spray went over to the one table but 2 other tables weren\u2019t throughly cleaned.  And it took few seconds for the server to clean the table.  We would feel much better watching if it was cleaned better. (It shows how our table was cleaned..)  I would give better star rating but I am hoping to get the attention so they would pay more attention to how important to protect everyone including their own staff.  Food was great otherwise.",

They thermometer check you and sanitize your hands upon entry (more than our hotel did!) before escorting you to your table where once seated you can remove your masks. We had a 730pm reservation which is pushing it with a 1.5 year old and a 5 year old who have been at the beach all day , however as soon as they saw that we had kids, they were quick to take our orders and get the kids food out which i appreciate sooo much! Everything we ordered was divine and the portions were really good size. Wait staff was on it and the atmosphere reminds me of europe or like a cute stylish cafe in Bali which we don't have a lot of here in Hawaii. 100 percent will be back!",

Their miso soup is made with actual kombu and bonito which you can taste. I also love ordering their sushi rolls and am looking forward to trying some of their beef dishes. Their hours aren't currently reflected in Google, they are open much earlier than is shown. Please support this local restaurant if you can and tip them generously as they are staying open for us while many restaurants had to close. Thank you Zigu!",

It was the usual cost expected of a Waikiki eatery - even though we had a coupon from the \"Best of Oahu\" book.  We were 2 adults and 2 kids, and with the coupon it was $85 (but we were still hungry).  We were seated near the door where people smoked so that also contributed to making the meal less enjoyable.

It's getting pretty good and the amount of food is just right.Good for recommendation  Food is okay but too expensive for small plates. I'll never come back. Aloha table affiliate. A little high image, one dish is very small, it feels like a tavern snack, and may be good for those who want to drink. The macadamia nuts were delicious. The shop is always dark and not visible. A store where celebrities sometimes go. I wonder if it will come again.  Nov 2019, I didn't know there was a parking lot in the building opposite Starbucks. Free for 2 hours for $ 30 or more.

When I went with the kids, I didn't drink much, so I asked if I could move to the garden, and they said no. Looking at the menu, the happy hour menu applies only to the bar area:) After visiting and looking at the reviews, the snacks were delicious, but we only ate french fries.

The bonito sashimi was awesome, the pork-belly udon was under-whelming, the rest were very good. It was a good experience and I'd recommend it.",

Service was alittle uneven because different staff dropped by but I did not really have anyone taking care of me.  I had the pork dish which was good as was the price reasonable, but it did not fall in the fine dining category.  The dish was infused with honey but the overall taste was not very nuanced - it tasted like a barbecue rib with some added sugar.

Interesting and delicious food. We had a table of three and ordered 6 or 7 items to share. Service was top notch and the food was some of the best I've had anywhere. The tuna cheek was absolutely incredible, I can't stop thinking about it. Such a great dish. I have never seen it on a menu anywhere else and all three of us were blown away by how delicious it was. I am so glad we stopped in and please give my kuddos to the chef, just awesome food. This place is damn good, and if you don't enjoy a meal here while visiting the area, you are missing out on a very memorable experience. Also ask about the restaurant upstairs called Paris Hawaii--I went there the next day and was equally impressed. Whoever runs this place knows what they are doing. Great job!",

It's a refreshing dish after eating several days of heavier meals. Chirashi is good for it's presentation, but nothing too out of ordinary from my experience.",

The Chirashi was very good and had a ton of different items besides fish to add to the texture and flavor. There were mushrooms, sweet potato, kale, and shredded carrots. Added to the overall experience without being too much. The sukiyaki beef had really good flavor, but the beef we had a bit stringy and tough. It came with a raw egg to dip the meat in and that was fantastic. The kale udon was really good as well. Noodles were bright green and chewy. The tsuyu dipping sauce was savory but the wasabi that came with it did not really have any kick to it. Pork miso soup that came with all the set lunches was amazing. One of the best miso soups I've had. It was chock full of pork and fried tofu bits.  They validate parking at the Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach for 2 hours.",

Overall, a little salty seasoned. It's nice to have a cup of rice instead of refilling it. You can choose from white rice and ten grain rice. The outdoor space was a pleasant feeling in the relaxing environment, but there were a lot of Kobae, I thought about making it indoors next time. It was a good impression that the staff tried to drive away saying sorry. However, the fruit fly without sweating Happy hour is beer $ 3 ~ and good price range in Waikiki.

        "caption": "Zigu is located at Seaside Avenue right next to Tapas Restaurant and Lanai Bar. It's a restaurant that I have driven by many times and never noticed a restaurant was located there. The interior has an all wood motif almost like an old sake distillery. My girlfriend and I were situated across from the kitchen, against the wall. We were granted a quick service by David--in and out within 50 minutes.  The parking is at Hyatt Centric Hotel, located at 349 Seaside Ave, Honolulu, HI 96815. It is situated half a block from Zigu--at a corner of Seaside Avenue and Kuhio Avenue. I highly suggest using a gps or Google Maps to the parking structure instead of to the restaurant because Waikiki is infested with one way streets. Zigu validate Hyatt's parking ticket if your restaurant bill is $30 or more.  Zigu's menu is not the most user friendly. It looks like a photo album without actual photos. I had to rely on social media pictures of their offerings to make informed choices. The restaurant provides free WiFi with its password discretely printed into the interior back cover of the menu. After looking at the menu, I can tell that it was well thought out, as well as each dish's components. Each item I ordered was interesting enough to merit a description. The following items were what we ordered:  Potato Salad Poke Sushi Fried Shrimp Rib Eye Ten Rice  The Apple Wood Smoked Local Egg Potato Salad with crispy potato sticks was a simple looking dish with a memorable flavor. The eggs were those 1 minute soft boiled / smoked egg with its yoke runny. The potato with its sauce was creamy and it helped dampen the saltines (smoky) taste from the egg. The potato chips was just another texture to the dish. I appreciate the portioning of the egg otherwise the dish would have been too salty and overbearing.  The Local Tuna & Kona Amberjack Poke Sushi with sea asparagus, seaweed, yuzu pepper should have been the very first item that was served instead of the smokey potato salad. The sea asparagus and seaweed were too small of garnishes to impact each slider's taste. The yuzu pepper was absent from the dish--that is after zooming into the picture I took of the dish. It was an almost amuse bouche since we were not amused.  The Deep Fried Kauai Shrimp with wasabi-basil aioli sauce was something out of Panda Express' menu--honey walnut shrimp. The difference is that there were 4 lightly battered jumbo (U10 size) shrimp and the creamy sauce had small green tobiko mixed into it instead of walnuts. Overall, the sauce tasted of wasabi. It did not taste of basil, especially while chewing on the basil garnishes. I appreciated that the head was fried crispy.  The Ten Grain Rice was chewy and had a neutral flavor. I used it as a palate cleanser between dishes. I just wish the rice was steaming when it reached my table.  The Diced Rib Eye Steak with grated local white radish & ponzu sauce came as a sizzling platter that errupted oily teriyaki smoke throughout the room and onto my clothes. The steak, surprisingly, was soft--its texture can rival the rib eye from Ruth's Chris. However, there was no actual seasoning, I tasted, on the steak as it was cooked. The sauce was not thick enough and there was not enough ponzu juice. The sauce was forgettable. I did not care for the radish as its texture was not crunchy because it was grated too finely and its taste was off putting. I could not exactly described why, but I did not find any contributing use by the radish.  Although each dish had slight short comings, I will be back and hungry for more.",

First, it did not mentioned in the menue there was a bacon in the potato with egg and apple sticks and we got another plate instead. The other 2 ordered did not come to our table which could be a mistake.  Our server left and we got switched to another one and he was nice. Not his fault that the order did not come in.  When we asked about our 2 left orders, he did not know also not his fault. He waived the $7 for 1 order because we had to go and did not want to wait any longer. Our issue is that the manager did not come and apologies for the inconvenience and the wait for nothing which he knew.  We got there at 10:05 and we left around 10:40pm.  Will not recommend the service!",
