For $10.75, you get a miso soup, green salad with ginger dressing, a spring roll, a California roll, white or brown rice and one of the entree options. I had the sesame chicken. Sauce was pretty sweet, but the chicken is white meat, the breading was not excessive like it sometimes can be. Overall, really good food and nice atmosphere. Will return if I'm in this area again.",
