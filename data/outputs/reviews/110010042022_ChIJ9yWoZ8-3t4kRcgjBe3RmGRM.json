If you want to order a full pizza you'll be fine, but if you want individual slices, it might be worth calling ahead to see what they actually have so you aren't disapointed when you get there.  The seating area is on the small size but is well utilized.  If they aren't busy, you can fit a decent size group but when they are busy it can get tight.",

They were trying to get rid of customers so kept telling them that they would have to wait 45 minutes for the food.

I ordered buffalo wings with 3 sauces- blue ch & ranch. We got none! Wings were soggy, pizza was cold & way overcooked. Hard as leather, very hard to chew, all edges were rock hard. Barely edible. VERY little cheese. I called repeatedly to try and get this order straight/redone, at least get our sauces. No one answered the phone. Rings 25 times and no answer. I can't imagine this place being THAT busy! I mean, why would they be? The food was subpar at best, cold & soggy. I wanted true NY style pizza. This cut up the inside of my mouth eating it as it was so damn hard. I wish I had just ordered from Pizza Hut or something. This is the problem being somewhere that u don't know the local places & u take a chance. Skip this place if you want good food!! Cuz this is NOT it!! Terrible. And not cheap!! 18.50 for a lg. pepperoni. And the pepperoni are tiny and sparse. It's not a good pizza. The wings are breaded. Yuck. Buffalo wings are not breaded. I'm sure it sat in a car for a long time before we got it. Terrible.",

Lots of choices in DC, but found this place on yelp and decided to give them a try.  Pizza arrived after a reasonable amount of time, but one pizza was missing.  I had already paid over $60 for this order.  The driver called the shop, and the gentleman tried to tell me I didn't order an additional pizza.  I said I did, and had the charge on card to prove it.  He said, he'd refund the whole amount and apologized for the confusion.  I thought this was too generous on their part, but he insisted.  After a month, no refund had been authorized.  I contacted them multiple times over several weeks, and was assured that they were working on it.  I uploaded a picture of my receipt showing the charge.  It's been 2.5 months now, and nobody has ever contacted me.  This is my first negative review, and I feel like I've given them every opportunity to make it right.  You might dine in with them, but I'd never order a pizza delivered unless you like to be charged double and still have to leave the hotel to feed one of your kids.",
