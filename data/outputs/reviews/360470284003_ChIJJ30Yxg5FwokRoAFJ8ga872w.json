I had to google the information.  This place is listed aa GoGo Chicken on Ubereats.  Food was not that great, i dont know if its because of delivery but some of it came soggy. Bbq skewers had no charcoal taste, they just cover the damn thing on cumin and their blend of spices.",

I ghink they're a bit much on that and need to relax more if you don't  want  people to take them don't  put them out like that where they're  accessible. Will I come back here? Probably not.

I would like a No. 1 set. Just eat the freshly fried chicken nuggets like this. Those who like to eat salty will taste it. If it is dipped in sweet and sour plum sauce, you may feel that it has a different flavor, sweet and salty, and salty and sour; French fries are sweet fries , Not potatoes from other stores; fried octopus is not particularly prominent, and the taste is okay; green tea burnt grass is okay. I visited again for the second time and ordered a special set meal and a glass of ice tea. The fried chicken tastes salty and fragrant. It has the flavor and taste of Chinese fried chicken. The preparation method is similar. The French fries are shredded potatoes. When they are first oiled, they are cooked with Chinese five-spice salt and the like. The taste is salty and dipped in tomato sauce, which has a Western flavor. The taste of iced black tea is icy and fragrant. I don't like this taste, but it doesn't mean it is bad.

It comes in a paper bag that you can poke with skewers. Tastewise, I think it is better than vivi's. Pricewise, it is more worth to get the combo than individual orders, since you get to try more variety.  Did I mention that this place delivers?!! Wait time after ordering is ~5-10 minutes so I recommend calling ahead to order then pick up. Otherwise they have seating in the store like a regular restaurant. Food comes piping hot out of the kitchen so it is fresh and crispy.  I highly recommend this place for the food. The drink menu is a little lacking, but this place's focus isn't on the drinks but the food.",
