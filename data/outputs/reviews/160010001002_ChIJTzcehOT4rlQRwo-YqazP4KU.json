There are so many points I could bring up about how it was lacking, but let's just say it took nearly 3 hours from start to finish. I could have walked out without paying without anyone noticing, but finally decided to walk up to the bar and ask for service myself. For the price, one would expect the service to be passable at least. Will not be returning.",

The flavors of the food isjis off. A lot of the food I've tried was sour or just weird flavor combinations that don't work. Portions are small for the price. When I ordered the vegan drunken noodles it came out with what looked like eggs. I told the server that it was supposed to be vegan. He assured me it was so I had him ask the kitchen staff who owned up to the mistake. When I asked what verisoy was he said that my dish would come with more vegetables, I later learned it's their mock meat. After spending hundreds of dollars here hoping to find something I enjoyed I think I'm done coming here. I'm not new to eating Thai food.

I ordered the vegetarian ramen and the vegetarian bao. I can\u2019t even stress enough, I may as well have been eating cardboard. Neither item had any flavor whatsoever. It was the most bizarre thing I\u2019ve ever experienced from restaurant food. I tried adding sriacha to the ramen, now I could taste heat, but nothing else. So I added a packet of soy sauce. Still nothing. So I added some hoisin (should have just ordered pho elsewhere apparently) and seriously nothing. And no, I don\u2019t have COVID, haha. Keep in mind this is $13 ramen! Definitely just buy the stuff for 59\u00a2 from the grocery store. The dumplings only flavor was a slight bitterness from whatever was mushed inside. I dipped those in leftover orange sauce from another restaurant which helped, but only because it then tasted like orange sauce. I\u2019d skip Mai Thai and go with a place that serves food with flavor. Sorry Mai Thai, but very very bad. I swear, I think the cook forgot to use whatever spices and seasonings they were supposed to and served me pure flour and water.",

The major issue is the wait times, as food is regularly late for one reason or another. Recently, I had to wait for almost 35 minutes past the ETA listed on my online ticket and received no explanation from the staff. Keep in mind that I had submitted the online order nearly an hour prior to the stated pick-up time that they estimated.  I understand that there can be delays as I also work as a food delivery driver and usually I side with the businesses in cases like these, but when this issue repeats itself on multiple occasions, there\u2019s obviously a problem. There\u2019s also issue for delivery drivers too, as on multiple occasions, the food hasn\u2019t been ready when I arrived at the restaurant at or after the delivery time stated. I\u2019ve talked to other delivery drivers on occasion while waiting and they seem to have the same problem.  There also seems to sometimes be an issue with quality control, as sometimes the food is great and other times it\u2019s not so good. In my most recent (and most likely final) order, the spring rolls were quite dry and \u201cold-tasting\u201d, while the curry was perfectly fine. This isn\u2019t their primary issue, but it\u2019s worth being stated nonetheless.  TL:DR - Mai Thai has decently good food, as long as you\u2019re willing to take the chance on having to wait an excessively long time for it. I personally won\u2019t be accepting delivery orders or making a personal one from them again.",

My daughters also have great memories here. I took them to Les Miserabl\u00e9s a few years ago, and we hit this place before the show. Love it!

However, I have had several occasions where the fish was outright spoiled on busy nights. My most recent trip being bad enough to prompt this review. I came with my wife on Friday and we ordered 3 drinks, an appetizer and 3 sushi rolls. The drinks and app were great, but the sushi rolls were beyond bad. The fish was spoiled and inedible. We alerted our waiter to this fact and assured him that while our drinks and app were great and we wanted to pay full price, our fish was too rotten to eat. We only had a total of 4 pieces between us two. He said, no worries, and checked in with management. He came back and said, he could only give us a \"50% discount because we did eat the majority of our meal.\".....we definitely didn't, but this felt like a fair compromise as we knew it wasn't his fault...then we read the bill. It wasn't 50%, but rather 15% off. Couldn't believe it. We paid the requested price and didn't argue, as it wasn't our waiter's fault, but my goodness. How embarrassing out of management. They lost our business for good, no question. I would caution others against this place on weekends, as our experience has been quiet poor. Even on a good night, you're paying for atmosphere and location with the food prices, but when they serve mealy, ruined fish on weekends...hard no, I'll go elsewhere.",

I had two and I'm pretty sure there was maybe a half shot of alcohol in both. I say that because both drinks were about 3-4 ounces each and I didn't taste any alcohol.. And I'm a huge lightweight. For the price of the drink, I felt kinda ripped off. But other than that I do absolutely love the food here. And please.. Try the smoothies!  UPDATE: I didn't mention before, but my husband and I have been going to Mai Thai every year for our anniversary because it holds sentimental value to us. We were just there again last week for our anniversary. And it I was dissapointed. The sushi rolls didn't seem fresh (and I'm not just talking about the sea food part) and sounds weird.. but the rolls weren't even rolled very tight so they were a little difficult to eat. The rice we ordered was rather salty as well. Maybe for a Sunday they just weren't on their \"A\" game? And maybe the rice was known for being salty? Note: We usually order the same thing every time and look forward to it every year. Been going for 5 years now. But this year our visit was just wasn't very good. I was honest with both wait staff that asked us how it was. They kindly tried to offer free dessert. We just weren't interested in the dessert offered and kindly declined. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt because past visits were fantastic. But I feel like for the price, location, etc.. there really shouldn't be any \"bad days\" with food service. The fact they did let us leave not happy and dissatisfied with the food overall made me sad. I feel like next year we may pick another place to celebrate our anniversary.",

The Mango Sticky Rice has an interesting twist, it's actually really excessive and a complete deviation from the traditional dessert, but it's very good. The prices are great. If you've never had Jackfruit and would like a taste, this restaurant serves a Jackfruit \"sushi\" roll and it's really good. Service is unusually quick as well. My experiences have been wonderful.",

Seemed like a simple fix to just serve us drinks where we were already seated.  Then the 10+ flies that circled our table landing on our food all through the meal was less than appetizing.

Instead, there was a bunch of huge tomato chunks. I hate tomatoes, which is why I make sure to order a dish without them.

Both were very good, but loaded with ice so the actual beverage amount was small. For dinner I ordered a Hot Mamma sushi roll, and Evil Jungle Prince, a vegetable curry with Duck.  Spice level of the entre was perfect for me, with a nice burn that wasn't overpowering. But the portion was small and had maybe 3 ounces of duck meat. Overall, not a very good value for the price. The Hot Mamma roll was small too.  I give this place 4 stars for quality, but only 2 stars for value, average of 3",

My massaman Curry had beef cheeks which I now know of which I am not a fan. Other dishes had proteins such as sturgeon and pork belly. In all fairness you can substitute any protein on their menu. So kudos for using premium ingredients at not much higher prices. The sauces of the curries that we had were exceptional and the presentation gorgeous. The appetizers during happy hour we're great as well. My sushi roll was excellent. The spring rolls, kind of bland. It's a beautiful space and a great dining experience if you love Thai.

There's a reason Mai Thai has won lots of foodie awards - their menu and offerings are superb.  However, that being said, I had an experience there during a recent happy hour that really ruined it for me. A gentleman -- who I assume was a manager based on how he was dressed -- brought out the food I'd ordered for happy hour. I immediately realized there was a mix up, brought it to his attention, and instead of a typical \"Hey no problem, we'll take care of it\" kind of response, he berated me in front of the people at my table for the mistake and told me \"the food during happy hour is already cheap\" so I shouldn't make extra requests. He fought me for an uncomfortably long time in front of a busy restaurant. On top of that, he publicly scolded our wonderful waitress. It was one of the most unprofessional things I've seen in a restaurant and really ruined the experience. I'm bummed that Mai Thai would risk their reputation by keeping someone around who treats their customers and staff that way.",

However, our server didn't tell us that they only offer if at the bar. We think it is ridiculous since it is not a big place and the bar is only few steps away. They should have said something since it is our first time. Pad Thai and Fried rice was great. Chicken Thai Basil was good but the portion was really small for the price. They served less than a cup of rice. For dessert the Mango Sticky Rice was good but their donuts are more like bigger churros. They are not soft. We will probably be back for the Pad Thai. I'll stick with Barbacoa for Happy Hour.",

I've been wanting to try this place for some time and tonight I finally did! Yay! I'm a SUPER fan and will visit again soon, tomorrow perhaps?!?  Walking in, I was nervous because I didn't have reservations and I looked at other reviews on Yelp using the keyword \"Happy hour\" and it was very clear that I needed reservations. I walked in about 5 pm and I was the only person there, which allowed me to look around and take some photos. Beautiful-- period. Shortly thereafter the people rolled in, and rolled in, which was an ah ha moment! Get there early! The crowd was all over the place, which as a sociologist I loved. People are beautiful and amaze me! This is a smaller establishment and they do their best with space. Look up at the fans--- never seen that before (look at my video).  Being a single dad of 4 I've recently learned that Happy Hour is a way to get what you want, and pay half the price and Mai Thai didn't disappoint. The waiter was very nice, knowledgeable, and receptive.  Happy Hour is 1/2 price apps and BOGO drinks! You must sit in the bar area for Happy Hour, but there are over 10 tables, one booth and ample seating at the actual bar. You just can't sit in the dining room.  This is what we ordered:  Portobello Tempura Mushrooms ($6 happy hour $12 regular) A++ Huge chunks of Mushroom tempura covered and fried. Served with Sweet Soy sauce. Epic!  California Roll--  ($5 HH $10 reg) These rolls were wrapped very tightly and big chunks with quality ingredients-- another A+ Ordered two of them! Classic Kani and avocado roll with sesame and cucumber.  Thai Chicken Satay's with a peanut sauce ($6 HH $12 reg.) 3/5-- not my favorite, but good nevertheless. _________________________________________________________ ********* DRINKS************ Full bar-- bartenders are true mixologists! Their menu has lots of signature drinks and lots of different expirimental drinks. Again, BOGO. I ordered:  First was Spiced & Iced-- Markers Mark, Averna, Amarula, Thai Chili Honey, Mint, Thai Iced Coffee and vanilla whip. This was really good, but has a little spice to it, which is good-- just beware.  Should I get another? Of course, I should because it's free! BOGO ... I couldn't decide between the house Mai Thai or the or the smoke show. I asked the waiter and he was 100% invested in the smoke show, which is: Bulleit, rye, Benedictine, Peychaud, burnt pineapple, with baked pinecone smoke. When it was brought over you could smell the smokiness... mmmm it was good n strong.  Well, thanks for reading. I hope you get to enjoy Mai Thai and have the most amazing day ever! Thanks for reading!",
