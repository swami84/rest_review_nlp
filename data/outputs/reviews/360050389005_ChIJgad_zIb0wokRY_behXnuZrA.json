We ordered the chef special pasta, baked ziti, a house salad and garlic knots.  The chef special pasta, two manicotti, two ravioli, two stuffed shells in pasta sauce covered with mozzarella. The manicotti I liked, the stuffed shells I liked, the ravioli tasted strange, possibly because they were burned. The sauce was sweet which doesn t affect the review, and it was chunky, which I enjoyed very much, another reason for the 2 stars. The baked ziti was my roommate's, she states the pasta was undercooked, which is strange for a pasta dish that is cooked twice. The salad also my roommate's.  She enjoyed the salad, another reason for the two stars. The garlic knots, completely inedible. They were not very brown, they were completely burned.  And the cherry on top is that the containers the food was in arrived crushed and the food had shifted alot during the ride, almost as if there had been an abrupt stop and it had fallen, so all of the cheese that topped my pasta was stuck to the lid and the presentation was very sloppy.  I'm really hoping that today just happened to have been a bad day for the restaurant because I'm quite disappointed. The good reviews are what led us to order from them.",

I guess I'll just bite the bullet and order from John & Joe's near Lydig and pray they'll deliver. One more thing to note, I live down the street and my pizza was cold. How is that even possible? It's a four minute walk to my door and the pizza was already barely warm. My zeppolis also had some sauce (maybe vodka sauce but I didn't order pasta so why that's even anywhere near my food is upsetting) and a piece of pasta on the container. Too many red flags and I left a tip before I discovered all this so wasted money galore.",

I was disappointed and decided I would give this place a chance after seeing it a few times on grubhub, but paying it little to no mind. I wasn't expecting much, pizza arrived shortly after the order and it was it fresh and hot.  I took the first bite and I was in heaven. I immediately shut off the movie I was watching, because this was better. The sauce, I don't know what they do to the sauce, but I don't think i've ever had sauce that good. The cheese was perfectly distributed and melted so properly that it was barely visible. I'm almost tempted to order another one for breakfast.  Best pizza I've had in this area by far. Hell, I'm almost tempted to call it the best I've had in the last few years, but I'll have to order it a few more times.  That place that couldn't complete my order is completely out the question. I'll be ordering from from here from now on.  If you're reading this though, lower your expectations. The pizza was great because it was great, but also because I had NO expectations. Reviews can set the bar so high you don't enjoy something. I don't even write reviews, but they deserve it. My initial thought was to call the store up and salute the guy that made it.  5 Stars. Would give more if a could.",

The exposed brick and textured ceilings give the place a nice touch. As with most pizzerias, you can see the entire kitchen and everything looks spotless! Now for the food! I had the Luconi Slice, which was phenomenal. It's a super unique carbonara slice, which tastes as creamy and decadent as it looks. The crust is perfection and the the sauce is...well...you've got to try it for yourself! I also had a classic plain slice that would make any New Yorker proud! Perfect crust and the sauce, again, was amazing! Finally, the staff is great. I met the owner who was super down to earth and welcoming. For a new spot on the block, I have high hopes for this pizzeria!",
