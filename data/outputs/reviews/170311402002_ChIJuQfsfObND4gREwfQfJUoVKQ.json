Then he placed in a box all brown and black uncut with a chunk missing and I finally had the courage to say I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t want burned pizza he litterally slammed it into the garbage and I said can you make another one he said he can\u2019t ... then said there is no more . He was allready rude but I went on to pay . When paying he says it\u2019s not burned and if I don\u2019t like it whatever that all pepperoni pizza burns . I asked him to take it out of garbage so I can show him he refused he knows it was burned the store even smelled burned .... he then walked away from me  I spoke to his manager she didn\u2019t seem to really be affected just said I\u2019m sorry but he still stood there and gave attitude to me saying he is not rude and if I don\u2019t like it whatever , that he\u2019s not forcing me to pay it .

I ordered a foot long Ham Sandwich on a Italian Herbs and Cheese bread, everything was going well, he asked me if there\u2019s anything else I would like to which I replied, after a few seconds, yes. I told him that I would like the same sandwich but in a 6 in bread, he then told me that if I get 2 foot longs it will be cheaper, but I know I couldn\u2019t bring myself to finish 2 foot Longs, I can only finish a foot long and 6inch, with that in mind I kindly declined him, BUT he insisted I get another foot long, and I kindly declined him again, one last time he asked me and I once again declined him. After that he took out a 6inch and slammed it on the table and put on an upset face, I didn\u2019t put much attention to it cause I thought he was just tired or something since it is a 24hour open restaurant. My foot long was ready to be taken out of the oven, so during that time it was going fine and what not, he put on the veggies I requested and then did the same with the 6inch, after that it was time to pay, so i got 2 beverages which were the Raspberry flavor X2 which costs $2.50 each, the 12inch was $4.99 and the 6inch was $3.75 I believe. So I paid and the total was $16.88 after taxes, so I sat down and ate my footlong, as I was getting to my 6inch I glanced at my receipt and saw $1.50 which confused me, I looked at it again and saw 5 items on my receipt. I double checked it, to make sure I wasn\u2019t just imagining it. The prices in order were $3.75, $1.50, $5.00, $4.99, I was trying to read what the $1.50 was for and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was cause there was barely ink on the damn thing, you can clearly see the prices and a little bit of the number of items, I knew there were 5 items because under the items column it read 1,1,2,1. So I sat there confused still trying to figure out why he charged me $1.50, so after I finished my 6inch sub I decided to confront him, I asked him \u201chey, can you tell me what the $1.50 was for?\u201d  I handed him the receipt and he looked at it after looking at it, his hand was shaking a bit, he looked around and offered me a cookie, I was confused and asked him the same question, he then offered me chips, after that I knew he was guilty, so then I asked him \u201cwhy did you charge me $1.50 more ??\u201d He stood there for a minute and then opened the register to take out my money, he handed me back my $1.50, after I got it, I was still In shock that he did that to me, I was so kind to him. I believe he did this to me because I wouldn\u2019t take another footlong, like seriously?  I asked for my receipt back so I can have proof of what had happened and put down a review of that restaurant with a picture of my receipt on Google Maps, but he kept denying me, the manager was there NEXT to him and she didn\u2019t do anything, she looked at me like I was the bad guy which I clearly wasn\u2019t.",
