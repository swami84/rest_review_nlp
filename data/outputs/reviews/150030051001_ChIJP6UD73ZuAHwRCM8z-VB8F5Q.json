This is a small place that serves simple Cantonese comfort food at very very affordable price. They are opened for dine in but could only seat around 12 people. This family run business deserves more 5-star reviews!",

Not a big fan of their fat-noodle dishes, but definitely try their rice plates, such as their black pepper pork chop w/ rice. For the price, you get really decent food! There's free 30-min validated parking in the back (entrance @ Kukui st) where the Chinese School is.",
