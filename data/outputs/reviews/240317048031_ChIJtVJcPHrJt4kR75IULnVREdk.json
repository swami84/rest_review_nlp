There are much better locations (Like fairfax) out there. I can\u2019t speak on the food because after being in the restaurant for over 30 mins (which probably counted towards the \u201c90 min limit\u201d) no one even offered me a glass of water. After being neglected, I told the bartender about my experience and how I usually go to fairfax, her response was \u201cyou should go to fairfax then\u201d or something along those lines. I was famished so it didn\u2019t resonate until after I walked away. The way the store is run, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised it the food comes out cold and servers had attitude problems like the bartender did. But I can\u2019t say for a fact because they never cared enough to greet me or attend to me.  P.s. I ended up coming to fairfax and it\u2019s a night and day difference. All smiles and radiating positivity. I hope upper management takes notice.",

Service was good and the server was attentive to us  and our party.  My only disappointment was my drink,  I tried the skinny Margarita and It just wasn't to my liking but they were great about it and offered me to substitute and decided on the Common Bond.

I wanted his attention to ask for Stevia for my cinnamon vanilla latte, he looked over at me, we made eye contact and next thing I know a little glass jar was sat on the table with packets of sweet confection.  Not only is the atmosphere comfortable, but this waiter can apparently read your mind.  The food???  Awesome (singing)!  This time I had the Inside Out Quinoa Burger and a half Mediterranean Salad.  The only conflict I had was to eat it fast and be disappointed that it was gone too soon, or it eat slow and savor the flavors.  Well I was starving, so I inhaled it. ...and now I can hardly wait til I dine here again.  I've got plenty to try here as there is no shortage of fare for anyone.  One friend got the Unbeetable Burger which was DIVINE, and another got the Grass Fed Burger which I did not taste.  ...but my meat eater friend said they'd be back to get another.

        "caption": "I would like to preface this review by saying that I have only written one other Yelp review before. It was for a tailor who was able to alter a military uniform for me in a pinch and I was very appreciative, so I wanted to let others know of the great service. I do not typically feel moved to write reviews about negative experiences, but what happened to me at the Bethesda True Food Kitchen this past weekend was so unacceptable that it needs to be shared. A good friend of mine was visiting from out of town, so I decided to take her to True Food for dinner after having several delicious meals there in the past. I made a reservation for 7:15. We arrived to the restaurant at 7:22, upon which we had to wait in line to get checked in. We were checked in at 7:24 and told by the hostess that our table wasn't ready yet, so we would have to wait at the bar. This was not a problem, but I did nicely ask what time she anticipated our table being ready. She responded very rudely that the restaurant had a lot of reservations that night and she had \"no idea\" when the table would be ready. I was taken aback by this but did not wish to press the issue, so we went to the bar and ordered a drink. At 7:45, we still hadn't been seated, so I went back over to the hostess stand to check on the status of our table. The hostess once again responded with hostility that the restaurant had a lot of reservations that evening and there was nothing she could do about the wait. She then proceeded to swipe through all of the reservations that night on her iPad to prove her point. At this point, I asked her if I could speak to the manager. The manager came over and I introduced myself and began to explain the situation. The manager barely even let me get a word out before she told me that since I came in at 7:24 for my 7:15 reservation, my table had been given away. She then asked me, \"At what point did you think it was acceptable to call my hostess an a**hole?\" WHAT?!?! I was sooo totally shocked by this accusation that I didn't even know what to say. I told the manager that I would never call someone that and that I was extremely offended that she would point-blank accuse me of this. I explained that I had very nicely asked the hostess for an update on the table, she responded the way that she did, and I had asked her to see the manager. After I was done, the manage told me that she had \"let me go on for long enough\" and that a table would be ready soon. I was so upset that I was shaking and I told her that I had no intention of staying for dinner or ever returning to this restaurant again. She responded, \"I am sorry you feel that way\", and that was that. We placed our unfinished drinks on the bar and left. I have never been so poorly treated in my life by someone (supposedly) in the hospitality industry or otherwise. It is a wonder to me that this woman was even able to get a job at a chain restaurant in Bethesda for the way she feels it is acceptable to treat customers. I hope that at the very least, this manager will be required to undergo training so that she can learn how to not only be a better employee, but a better human being. We were fortunately able to salvage the evening by enjoying a lovely meal at Terrain down the street. I won't be back to True Food Bethesda, and I suggest others stay away.",

Didn't receive our coffees which were ordered at the same time as the water until later. One didn't even come with the food until another reminder was uttered. A to go food item was ordered and upon delivery I gave a card to the person who dropped it off for that item which I told her. The entire order was charged to the card and not the to go item. I told the server about the mix up and shortly after the manager came over. She did apologize for the poor service but also blamed me for not coming to her sooner. I told her I didn't appreciate that and that I was done with the conversation. She did adjust the bill, which I appreciated, but at that point it was too little too late for me. I will never go to that restaurant again.",

I never even mentioned it was my birthday, so it had nothing to do with that. The chef, Chantal, came to our table to discuss the contents of various dishes and sauces, and we discussed alternatives.

Our host came back & said ( aww yeah you can set on any table you like) ...i asked her about this type of treatment everytime we got when enter the restaurant ... she told me ( When wanted you to set in corner table because there is NOT Enough workers in the main time to serve different tables) even though there was a total of 6  free serveres gathering near the bar area having a good chattering...i told our host ( this is the 5th time we encounter this type of hospitality of treatment from other hosts) & finally she said ( i cannot speak on behalf of other hosts) ...i called for one of the managers to explain to her the  repatitve situation  & is the True food kitchen  owned by the host  staff ???

Pictured is the spaghetti squash bake with a side of tofu, but the side was unnecessary and I wound up with a box. My other half reports that the turkey burger is tasty and the fish tacos are good but not great. The restaurant itself is attractive and well-designed. Dinner for two with an appetizer and non-alcoholic beverages runs $50-60 plus tip.",

Perhaps you enjoy being treated like dirt by the local teenage princess slumming as hostess and perhaps you like having your waitress disappear after taking your drink order, never to appear again.  Curious?  A detailed explanation is in order.  On our reservation we had requested a quiet table; instead, we were seated adjacent to a table with a baby.  The baby was seated in the isle between our tables, so close that the back of its highchair was touching our table.  I reminded the hostess that we'd requested a quiet table and asked her to relocate us. Instead, the local teenage princess had the gall to argue with me! and refuse to reseat us, saying there weren't any other tables available.  When I pointed out two empty tables near us she eventually capitulated but bypassed the adjacent tables and seated us at the other end of the space in what seemed to be the loudest part of the restaurant.  Retribution for daring to ask the local teenage princess to be reseated?  It sure seemed like it.  When, again, I asked why we couldn't be seated at one of the other open tables in quieter locations (from our vantage point we could see four open tables) we got a series of lame and conflicting excuses handed out to us in an imperious and patronizing tone as though she was doing us a favor to deign to speak to us.  In hindsight we should have walked out then.  We gave up, our middle aged will thwarted by the obvious superiority of the local teenage princess.  When our waitress arrived we were still fuming but had hopes that a nice glass of wine would cure our ills.  Order placed, we sat back and waited, and waited, and waited.  Nada.  10 minutes, 15 minutes, who knows?  Finally the manager arrived to inform us that our waitress had left because her shift was over and he would take our order!  Needless to say we recounted to him our experience with the local teenage princess and our desire for a quieter table so he immediately relocated us to a fifth empty table that we hadn't seen before.  (Dear reader, this means that there were at least five empty tables that the local teenage princess had refused to relocate us to.)  After all this, did the quality of the food make up for the indignities we suffered?  No, unequivocally no!  You cannot make up for outrageously terrible service with decent food.  In closing, it is worth noting that the manager offered us nothing in compensation for the terrible service.  Reader be warned, True Food should be renamed Truely Awful.",

We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately which was great. To start our waiter took our drink order and literally took 30 mins to come back. Then our meal order was taken. The food was ok, nothing spectacular. Our waiter literally didn't come back after our food order, turns out it was his birthday and he left without checking on us. Two of is sent back drinks, I don't know how you mess up Sangria but it was awful. Won't be going back and neither will any of my friends.",

I like the focus on healthy ingredients at True Food, but my real appreciation has been more recent. I had to give up dairy for my infant daughter. The menu tells me which items are vegan, and the staff are knowledgeable (or they find out), which other items don\u2019t have dairy. I can eat a delicious meal and not worry about accidentally eating dairy, AND they have yummy dessert options for me, too!",

I asked my waitress her recommendation between the spaghetti squash ($14) and the lasagna bolognese ($15).  She recommended the spaghetti squash mixed with the bolognese (sausage).  This sounded great until 1) I got the actual meal, and 2) the check.  The meal was very small compared to my colleagues', and I had a hard time even tasting the sausage.  Combining the two (basically adding a meat sauce to the spaghetti squash) also resulted in a $3 upcharge.  Yikes... Something the waitress definitely should have mentioned beforehand.  Basically, I felt ripped off.  The atmosphere was nice (if somewhat loud), as was the wait staff, but they need to let their patrons know about these upcharges ahead of time.  Overall, I was disappointed.",

It leans toward health food. But it's not good. It's kinda awful. Our server was friendly and charming but not at all good at his job. I could understand if the place were slammed, but it was a Thursday night with rows of empty tables. We ordered multiple items to try. We didn't get half of them. We asked and asked about our missing orders on various visits from our server to the point where it became a joke that included the staff. Everything is loaded with seeds. I had a kale side salad that was chopped kale - lots of fun chasing that around my plate - that had lemon juice and maybe nooch?  And that was it? When we get a chance to go out - no kids, no dogs - it's a bummer to try a place that serves items - badly - that I can make in my own kitchen with 3 ingredients and 5 minutes. Kale guacamole is every bit as bad as it sounds. Won't be back.",

There are far too many fabulous restaurants in Bethesda that hit the mark in terms of both food AND service, so there is no need to keep returning to an establishment that has two greeters that neither greet or can seat people at a table in a timely fashion. Most other venues have one person taking names and the number of your party, while the other person seats guests. Now that the secret is out or that I informed the general manager you would think that things turned around for us, but he just put the nail in the coffin. If you are in a good mood and looking to celebrate an event.....stay clear of this place. Check out Silver instead.",
