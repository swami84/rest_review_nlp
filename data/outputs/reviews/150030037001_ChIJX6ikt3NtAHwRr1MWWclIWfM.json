Chef is talented and so much fun to watch and talk story with. There are only 6 seats so be sure to make a reservation EARLY as he is often booked 2+ weeks out. Two seatings: 1130AM & 130PM.  There are some pretty adventurous items so be sure to ask before you embark on your journey. We will be back!",

        "caption": "Located in the Ohana Marketplace. There is a couple of sushi places inside but this one is the closest to the stage.  The chef is from Naru so it\u2019s still quality and taste great. The fish he picks up from the fish auction in the morning. He made the comment that it\u2019s just like Japan where he rides his moped to see what\u2019s available.  Omakase was $80  or you can pick from the menu. One item which isn\u2019t for all is the MF Spicy Tuna. It really is MF ..... burn going in and burn coming out. I know TMI but it\u2019s a warning  :)  I would suggest to make reservations as there is a 6 seater at the bar and a table on the side for 6. It\u2019s BYOB which is great for sushi spots these days.  If you lucky the lady across makes really Lechon.",

He asked me which handroll I wanted and I replied whichever he thought was best. I guess I was the first customer because he started to open up this beautiful avocado to prepare for me a definitely oishii California roll. A lot of detail goes into his preparation of the sushi. I also ordered two pieces of IKURA nigiri, and watched how he careful took the bowl of ikura out of the fridge, carefully opening it up and using a spoon to put a small of it on the back of his hand to taste it before continuing to assemble my sushi.",
