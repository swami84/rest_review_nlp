I guess we got lucky, there\u2019s a review here that said the adobo pizza was luke warm, ours was pretty hot. My friend loved it. I haven\u2019t tried that yet. I like how it\u2019s big, open air with cover and tables are far apart. Great way to social distance.",

I think they might be short staffed, or at least it seemed like it tonight. When we arrived there were no other customers so we were a little surprised by a 20 minute wait for the food. While we were waiting for our food it began to get busy. I ordered the adobo pizza just to try something different and it was luke warm. My first bite had a piece of chicken with bone which was an unfortunate surprise. It's definitely a creative take on adobo. The taste was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. My husband had the plantation breakfast with the ube pancakes and we had halo halo for dessert. The winners of this experience were the ube pancakes and the halo halo. Maybe other menu items are better and maybe we came on the wrong day, but I'm not sure if we will return.",
