The problem is simple. If people are expected to be eating outside and trying to help subsidize our restaurants the staff should be far more attentive to what is going on. There is no excuse when you are dealing with so many fewer customers. We will do our part of the restaurants go the extra mile. Those that don't won't survive this pandemic. It is all about the service. Then the food. We can forgive food being not it's best. But there will never be an excuse for poor service. Both were improved this time.",

The loss of a star is due to the waiter not enquiring as to whether I wished fresh ground pepper or not and their not investing in clips to hold down the linen tablecloths which we fought with all throughout the meal. The water man should be promoted to head waiter for his consideration and diligence. Nunzio, the proprietor, should take notes.  An additional note. We went back today with a larger group and dined in the outdoor patio in the rear with a fountain. This experience is far nicer than dining on the street. Also, the service was far better with the same wait staff. A pepper mill was brought and the waiter was far more attentive. Same waiter as before.",

One Sunday afternoon we took a drive from Connecticut to the Arthur Avenue section, the\" Little Italy\" of the Bronx, After taking in the sights and smells of the shops, markets and bakeries, We stopped to discuss our dinner plans. Suddenly a woman ran out from a restaurant with a strange look on her face. I thought she was going to tell us not to hang out in front of the restaurant with our dog. But she quickly dropped to her knees to shower affection on our bulldog. She introduced herself as Pat - the owner of the restaurant. she told us she absolutely adores bulldogs. She told us they had a beautiful garden in back - but of course, Board of Health rules made it impossible for us to dine there with our canine buddy. And it was too warm to leave our Bulldog, Cooper, in the car (never a good idea at ANY temperature. So we decided to do take out. Pat went over virtually every item on the menu. Most dishes were made with homemade pasta - a totally different taste and texture than the dried stuff. My aunt used to make her own pasta and it was amazing.  So we ordered two dishes to go: Rigatoni with Sicilian meat balls (reminiscent of brajole, with pine nuts and spices), and we ordered fettuccine Bolognese topped with ricotta cheese (or as they say in Naples \"riggot)\".For dessert we chose Italian cheesecake - a very sweet treat. If you're expecting Cheesecake Factory fare, fuggeddaboudit. This is the real thing that maybe isn't for everyone, but it sure was for me. So we took our meals and made the trek back to Connecticut - about a 45 minute drive. When we got home we dove in - each of us sampling the other's. I grew up in a family of exceptional Italian  cooks, and my wife is a true afficionado. We were blown way. Every bite was beyond delicious. It brought me back to my childhood. Oh - I forgot something important. The meals came with fresh Arthur Avenue bread, in my opinion the best Italian bread anywhere, with its slightly chewy crust and flavorful inside, it's perfect for mopping up the last exquisite bit of sauce. And we did.",

Wandering in to Emilia's we saw they had a backyard patio and decided to take advantage of the dying embers of a lovely summer afternoon. We shared a few appetizers and a delicious bowl of Penne with Pancetta and Peas - simply wonderful! However, the true star of the meal was the bread they served beforehand. The humble Italian loaf can sometimes make a whole meal itself making ordering before eating a dangerous game of portions. The bread they served was warm and just crusty enough to pick up the oil and butter  The outdoor backyard patio is a wonderful place to enjoy your meal, as it is fully enclosed and as the weather gets chilly, giant heaters are at the ready to warm things back up. Service can be a bit slow, which would be understandable if the restaurant was packed, but nearly incomprehensible at 3PM on a Friday with only 3 other tables seated.",

Emila's was recommended by a friend so we decide to give it a try. It wasn't as crowded and the wait wasn't as long as some of the others. Besides, we were starving!  The food was as expected with Italian American fare...spaghetti with meatballs,  gnocchi, ravioli, parmigiana etc. They were out of the stuffed artichokes so decided to try the Arancini which I loved in Rome. In America the Arancini has grown up to become supersized tennis balls. It was good, similar to what I remembered but didn't take me back to Via Appia. I tried homemade pappardelle with wild boar. The pasta was al dente and flavorful. The meat was tender and did not overwhelm the dish. The other dish ordered was salmon and vegetable as you would expect and not much to write about.  Overall, it feels like a restaurant in Little Italy in the city for me except it is in the Bronx and no tourists mobbing the streets. While this is a good alternative I need to try the others around to really compare. So I'll be back.",

Besides the Manhattan prices, the portions were small and the taste was bland. 3 people in my group. I had \"homemade\" manicotti. I have had better at a mom/pop pizza place for HALF the price! Swordfish was about a $4-5 piece from market for $22. Pasta side was filled HALF way with water! I suppose they do T have a strainer in the kitchen. Stingy with bread and olive oil. And the cheese...even Olive Garden shreds fresh cheese @the table. Emilia's served preshredded cheese in the EXACT same jar as a local pizza shop. NEVER EVER AGAIN.  Service was blah as well. If you're seeking delicious authentic Italian, look else where.",
