We chose this spot because it says on the Google Map it closes at 4am, but only to get there and found out it doesn't. I was fortunate to meet someone who works at the restaurant that explained to me that the time I see on Google map is pre-covid, and that most hospitality and restaurant businesses close at midnight in New York because of covid-19. So if you plan going to this spot just have it at the back of your mind it doesn't stay open till 4am as stated on the map. This bar is pretty close to the road and can be easily noticed from a vehicle in normal traffic. There's also wheelchair accessible entrance  here. #Bar #NewYork #Manhattan #WheelchairAccessible #NYC",

Their drinks were sooo good but their food was terrible , ordered shrimp and you can just smell how old the shrimp was , sounded like the guy put the shrimp in the microwave to defrost it. Everything on my plate was terrible the only decent thing was the mash potatoes. My boyfriend and I were disappointed because we had the restaurant to ourselves for maybe 30-40 mins until another couple came but the disappointment came because we were so hungry and barely even touched our food but got a little tipsy with the drink and was still hungry of course. The waiter was cool and by himself so I\u2019m guessing he was under pressure but it was my first time there and it will be my last .",
