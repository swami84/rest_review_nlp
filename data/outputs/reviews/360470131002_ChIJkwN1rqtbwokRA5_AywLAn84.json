The included toast had no butter but at least the home fries were tasty and well cooked if a bit mushy.  The city has so many great spots for brunch. Find one of those and skip Wild Park Slope.",

Cheese was nothing special. The prosciutto pizza had tabasco thrown all over it- very lazy. The basil on the pizza was diced so small- it was sad and tasteless. The salads had HAIR IN THEM. Several strands of short black hair. Pieces of lettuce were wilted, cherry tomatoes were obviously pre- cut- not cut to order. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The salad had hardly any dressing on it. And - the corn that was meant to be in the salad, which was on menu was dnot in the salad. When we asked why our salad  came with no corn, we were told \u201coh, its not available, we ran out and dont offer the corn anymore but haven\u2019t changed the menu\u201d.

I've had the oysters, also very nice. Everything has been submitted fine, but the service. Not that the service was rude, it is just very \"new\" very inexperienced, and slow. I will update this review as time goes on and they get better. I really wish them well. Give them a visit.",

Our server fd up our order, and brought us 3 pizzas instead of two (remember, me and my wife). Then confronted us aggressively about how we were at fault. We then ask for the manager/owner. She was equally useless and rude and basically said the whole ordeal was our fault. Said she was going to see what she could do, but didn't do anything. Just sat in the back and was on her phone the whole time. At least they didn't charge us for the server's mistake. Nice to have a gluten free place close to our apartment since my wife has celiac, but never ever coming back to this place.  It was prophetic when someone passed in front of the place and shouted \"worst service ever!\", then 20 mins later another lady walked by and said to her friend \"happy hour here is not so happy\".  Most restaurants in NYC fail even if run well, this one has its days counted.",

My husband and I had ordered a large pizza which the server said is actually two, at first we said fine then he had to go ask about a beer before he could finish our order, then he came back and I ask to change the food order. I said so since a large is 2 pizzas I think we are just going to get one and order a different pizza instead. We both felt we were clear, and he says okay, doesn't check to see if we are ordering three. (also we are just two people) Our food comes out and there are three pizzas. We sent one back, because we didn't order three.  The server comes back and confronts us, said he asked if two was okay and we said fine. He was rude and unapologetic. I have never had that happen before. I said yes then you came back and we asked to change our order. He proceeded to insist he was right,  making us very uncomfortable. I asked to speak to a manager, mainly because I have never been confronted by a server for a misunderstanding.  She said the server is responsible for mistakes and he had every right to confront us. At least now I know why he behaved so badly. What a terrible idea, so if a mistake happens you want servers to start fights with costumers? It ruined the meal at that point.  Won't come back.",

I ordered shrimp scampi highly recommend pasta tasted like pasta I make at home only better you cant even tell the difference we also ordered the nachos as soon as it hit out table we devoured it in a matter of seconds!! I love to eat especially when the food is outrageously DELICIOUS but it makes it even more enjoyable that I could bring my sister along and not have to fear her ending up sick.

When the server finally came over, she told us that they did not have pizza.  Well that really limits the menu since about half of the menu is pizza.  So, we left since the others in our party were going to order pizza.  How can you have a pizza place with no PIZZA?  Maybe try one of the other locations, but I would not waste your time traveling to this one.",

It was undercooked, and they put prosciutto in clumps on the pizza after it was cooked, making it gray and not good. The pizza also tasted heavily of capers.  Service is slow because they have one busboy and one server for brunch. I didn't finish a whole drink before they brought the food like the other reviewer, but it was a little close.  I'm assuming the owner is skimping on ingredients and the kitchen is trying their best with the minimal ingredients they have. Even just including more hearty bread with the shakshuka is a good start.",
