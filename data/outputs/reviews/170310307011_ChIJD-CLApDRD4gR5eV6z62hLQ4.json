They only had 2 people working the floor, so no big deal. But the service after that was pretty awkward. We got a lot of stares from workers and locals which made me slightly uncomfortable but I didn\u2019t make a big deal about it. The quesadillas were great. But we should\u2019ve just stuck with the Mexican options. My boyfriend ordered hot wings and we got the wrong order so we had to wait another 30 minutes for soggy, cold wings. I\u2019ll consider giving it another try when I have a taste for authentic Mexican. Hopefully our experience is less awks. Lol",

The carne asada tacos were dry and tasteless. The guacamole which we had before was half the portion as before and also tasteless. Perhaps because of the location they are not serving the dishes as before with less spices. The only reasonable tasty item was the red salsa. With that said the place cannot survive on just salsa! Thumbs down very dark atmosphere only three tables occupied indoors and two tables outdoors and two people at the bar. BTW I just finished speaking with the owner Daniel regarding eating on Dollar Taco Tuesday and Daniel said in two years he never had such a promotion and It\u2019s an insult to think he would ever do so.

So I explained to him the difference and he gets a attitude and tells me so what in a very disrespectful tone. So he takes the drink and gives to his friend. And pours me a shot with coke and now charge me $10 plus a $.50 for coke. What a joke and rip off when I was just here Monday got the same order for $7.50 which is what I normally pay. Never again and I can't wait to discuss this on my radio show. BEWARE OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY WITH THE OWNER RUBEN!!!",

I enjoyed their Sunday buffet as you get to enjoy different dishes for a set price and that includes some desserts and a coffee or juice. You can\u2019t really beat that! The staff is super friendly, although they seem a bit disorganized and nervous, which probably comes from being a new restaurant, so, be patient and kind. I gave them 3 stars because no restaurant, as Tex-Mex as it may be, should get away with serving basically Tostitos salsa! And I get it, some Americans aren\u2019t into hot or spicy, but if you\u2019re offering tacos al pastor or any kind for that matter, you better have a good salsa! At least options! Other than that, I recommend this restaurant and I\u2019m very happy it\u2019s part of our neighborhood.",
