I have never had fried chicken so juicy,flavorful, and fried to perfection. I also had the greens,sweet potatoes, and macaroni and they were absolutely delicious.  My husband had the chicken sandwich and it was humongous and packed with flavor.  My little one's had chicken strips that were humongous as well.  They are picky eaters and they gave their stamp of approval and even said they can't wait to come back\ud83e\udd70.  The fries were perfect (I mean PERFECT).  I also got a slice of hummingbird cake and it was UNBELIEVABLE \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d.  The lady at the counter was super, super friendly and made us feel right at home.  She was picking greens and it just made me think of my childhood \ud83e\udd70.  This place is family friendly and truly a treasure.  I can't wait until next time.  Thanks again Crazy Bird,your food and service was Crazy Good\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

Ask him sometime when you see him in the restaurant to tell you where he\u2019s cooked over the years and he might tell you some fun stories. I met Larry when he had N&N Smokehouse in Irving Park in Lakeview. BBQ fans will remember NN as one of the best Chicago has had and thankfully Larry reprises some of his BBQ at Crazy Bird as specials. Lately Larry has focused on fried chicken for which he has a special gift. I\u2019m from the South and to my taste there is none in Chicago that match his version. The crust is light but crunchy, perfectly seasoned; and the chicken itself is tender and juicy. Don\u2019t miss the sides- red beans and rice, greens and the like. And his wife makes some great desserts. I\u2019m friends with Larry as you might be able to tell, but I became a pal, a loyal customer and hired him to cater several times only after falling in love with his food.",

Staff was super attentive and the owner came out and chatted us up. Super friendly and made great recommendations. Food came out pretty quickly, the owner hooked us up with some free fries which was a nice gesture to welcome us in. Food itself was really, really great. Ate literally everything put in front of us. Def excited to go back and try more. Highly recommend!",

The meat was comprised of a single piece of chicken breast, flattened, breaded and fried to perfection. The buffalo style sandwich is topped with buffalo sauce, blue cheese, pickles and lettuce. The meat also seemed like it was in excess of 7 ounces, as the chicken breast had an overhang of one inch all around the sandwich. If you like the chicken sandwiches served at Chick-fil-A or Popeyes, give this place a try. I can guarantee that the sandwiches served at those fast food joints pale in comparison to the sandwiches served at this family run establishment.",
