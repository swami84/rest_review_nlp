It was like to garlic-y. I thought it was a fluke. The third time again to garlic-y I was again disappointed. Now I am not excited to bring people there. Also the second time a waiter messed up our orders pretty bad. Other two times waiters were good. The best part of the experience for me is the french fires. The bbq seasoning on them is really good. The fries taste great. I don't know if I will come back again. Also this review only for the fedwhich philly. Haven't tried anything else.",

I had the chicken club sandwich and my wife had the cheesesteak. Hers was excellent, great flavors and juicy. Mine was very good as well, but I felt the cherry pepper spread was odd (just added an unfamiliar flavor). But the chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and crispy, with thick cuts of bacon. The fries here are also very good. I'd highly recommend.",

A great place to get for takeout for a picnic! Will definitely be back.",

The fries portion was generous but the fries themselves were a let down. They were soggy, lukewarm, and I honestly didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d be seasoned. Packaging the fries separately in a ventilated box might allow for a chance they\u2019d arrive still crispy.  Update: I ordered again (now mid-July 2020). \u2013 KBC sandwich once again hot and excellent \u2013 fries portion generous, the seasoning has gotten better, and they arrived CRISPY and hot.  Nailed it, Fedwich. Now a 5 star rating.",

They just put sugar on some creme caramel and didn\u2019t torch it or anything (see pic). The best part of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is the top crust of caramelized sugar! Can we also talk about the weird unincorporated liquid pooling at the bottom of the dish? Support a different local business for now, these guys are just going to rip you off.",

(hydrate, people!)  pickup was quick and seamless, and the woman at the door was friendly.  overall, great meal and i'm pleased. will probably try out a couple more sandwiches later on this week.",
