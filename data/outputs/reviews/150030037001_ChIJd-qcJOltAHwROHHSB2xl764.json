If there is a sign that says pizza comes out at a certain time make sure to be there waiting in line before that. Customers have been know to buy two whole pies at a time and being a small operation they can only make so many at a time so don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. But this definitely speaks to just how good the pizza is.  [FOOD] At only $4 to $4.75 a slice it\u2019s a great deal, plus you can ask for them to cut it up in 4s which it makes it so easy to eat. Though I\u2019ve only tried the SPINACH, GARLIC & MUSHROOM I\u2019m definitely a fan of it. The pizza itself is not at all oily or greasy like other places named PH or PJ. Here\u2019s you can definitely taste the ingredients, and dang does it taste good. I found the sauce to be just right amount but that is just my opinion.
