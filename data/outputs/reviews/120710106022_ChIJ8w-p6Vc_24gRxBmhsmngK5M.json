Despite the unassuming location, the interior atmosphere and decor is tasteful, exotic, and romantic.  The service is flawless. Every member of the serving staff that I have interacted with over the years has been friendly and attentive. I've never run out of water and my food always comes out fast and fresh, even when they're extremely busy. I have never had a single complaint and every person I've ever brought here has loved their meal.  If you are a spicy food lover you need to try Thai! Siam Hut offers the option to customize your desired heat level. I order my food one level below the spiciness I want (usually hot) and ask for a side of chili oil so I can increase the intensity incrementally. It's a solid method that I recommend to everyone after once making the mistake of ordering a dish \"Thai hot.\" It was one of only two dishes that has EVER been too spicy for me (and still I ate it, I just cried the whole time). If you have a more typical spice tolerance I would advise using this same strategy, but maybe ordering mild or medium to start and adjusting to taste from there.  Highly recommend trying the appetizer sampler & the red curry!",

Unfortunately  the food was the worst ever. The dumplings were old and reheated, the Masaman Curry looked like it was thickened with some sort of thickening ingredient. I asked the waiter if the food had cornstarch and he asked another waiter, he came back and said no. We told him I have a severe reaction to corn. He walked away. 15 minutes after leaving the restaurant I had a corn reaction. Believe me I know what corn does to me. Have been sick all morning. My advice to this restaurant? Pay attention folks! You have lost me and my family as customers. I would have ordered another dish had I known you used cornstarch....which is usually never used in authentic Thai curries. The food was not good. Find a better chef, and be mindful of allergies and food sensitivities. This could have been a disaster if someone was allergic to peanuts and you did not disclose the ingredients after they asked. I am sure this was a very nice restaurant at one time.",

Service is quick, so eat fast so they don't clear your plate before you're finished. We were done in 30 minutes.  The Thai menu has a heavy Chinese influence, though, with the amalgamation of vegetables in each dish, and the portions, given how little chicken or shrimp are included, are a little small by American standards. Basically, this is Chinese food with curry paste, coconut milk and fish sauce instead of chicken stock, msg and cornstarch. Nice presentation, and a good break from American fare, though.  Every place has its surprises but this one's is a little macabre; The \"Kermit\" is the frogs legs special.",

I witnessed her give attitude and rude comment to two men one day yelling \"Don't you see I only have two hands!\" and the man only asked if he could have a water glass like his friend. Also, this girl constantly tells me there is no delivery man and huffs and puffs on the phone to deliver to me (I live 5 blocks away and work from home) & can't always leave to pick up. Not to mention she charged me $5 to deliver last time (bayview eglinton to bayview moore 1.5km).... This restaurant has good food but the staff keeps changing and this Indian girl is the worst  to have run your business in a professional,  friendly and calm manner.  The food is great and fresh and always better welcoming if staff isn't tense and rude to people eating there or having food delivered!  I am writing this because it is the 5th time incidents with me and that I have witnessed have happened when this Indian girl works there. Never issues when others have worked there at all.  The owner better be there more often and have more stable workers and focus her business in creating an actual team or else no matter how good the food is, people that work there will either make or brake your business eventually.  Good luck",

Had no problem placing the order and the food was ready when they said it would be. Curry was ordered to be Thai hot and had just the right level of heat without interfering with the flavor. Will definitely go back for more!",

Her mother was from Thailand, and was trained there as a chef.   Everytime this friend of mine is in town we go to Siam Hut.    He knows Thai food well.   Well enough to converse with the owner about food that isnt on thier menu, she'll make for him a Thai specality called Lob (pronounced Lop) a salad of sorts with cilantro and lime juice, traditionally made with pork, however they make it for him with chicken, and it's fantastic!",
