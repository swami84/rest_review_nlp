My mom, husband and I usually eat Mexican food on Friday nights whenever my husband and I are in town. We normally go to Phil's but didn't feel like driving. Downtown is right around the corner from where my mom lives so this location was convenient. The Friday afternoon we went was perfect. The weather was great and it was a good day to eat Mexican. The inside is very spacious. The seating was 6 ft apart if not more. We felt comfortable eating out right after COVID. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. I also love tapas style restaurants so this was a plus. I love being able to try multiple dishes at once.  My mom, husband and I all ordered a bunch of tapas and shared. We didn't share the single items like tacos but everything else was shareable.  My husband and I started off by ordering margaritas. I had a Watermelon Margarita and he had the Top Shelf, both were good! I was pleased with the balance of sweetness to alcohol my drink had. It wasn't overly sweet but the alcohol was balanced and not overpowering.  Now onto the food....  TOTOPOS W/ 2 SALSAS - YUMMM! Corn chips with roasted tomato serrano salsa and tomatillo salsa. These were probably the best chips we've had in a long time. They were seasoned with the perfect amount of salt and fried perfectly! The crunch with the salsas was so good! The salsas were also flavorful and tasted homemade.  ARTICHOKE CHORIZO DIP - GOOD! Homemade chorizo, artichokes, cream salsa. Side of totopos. This dip was very good and flavorful. I really enjoyed this dip.  ENCHILADAS DE CANASTA - DECENT! Potato hash, guajillo salsa, cabbage, sour cream and queso fresco. This was decent. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't anything special.  POLLO AL PASTOR TACO - GOOD! Grilled chicken marinated in roasted pineapple and achiote. Chipotle salsa, cilantro and onions. This taco was small and only comes with one. It was very flavorful and I love the play on a traditional Al Pastor taco (pork and pineapple). The chicken was tender and yummy! The pineapple adds that sweet kick!  CHORIZO TACO - GOOD! Homemade pork sausage, cilantro, onions, roasted tomato salsa. This taco also only comes with one. It was pretty good! I enjoyed the flavor. It wasn't the best chorizo taco I've had but it was decent.  FISH EMPANADAS - DECENT!  Lightly fried turnover, white fish, sweet peppers, pico de gallo. This was ok to me. I didn't feel it was anything special. Not bad but nothing to talk about.  FRIJOLES FRITOS - YUM! Peruvian refried beans, queso fresco crumble. Side of totopos. This dip is simple yet flavorful. I enjoyed this dip a lot!  Overall, La Esquina was pretty good. I would come back whenever I'm in downtown Huntsville and want Mexican.",

I have many friends and family in the service industry and It is extremely hard to run a restaurant right now.  The drinks are amazing. The Paloma in particular is a very good version of a drink which is hard to improve upon.  We have tried quite a few of the tapas and charcuterie.  Some of the reviews mentioned a lack of flavor.  That is definitely not our experience. The dishes are not salt and cheese bombs but the flavor is a very creative and unique take on Mexican/Central American home cooking I have had the joy to experience. The pricing is good as well.  Last time we ate here, my wife and I had a cocktail each, several taps, and left full and happy after a good tip for less than $60.  Can\u2019t ask for much better!!!",

        "caption": "Offers something different for Huntsville and Mexican food. The menu has a range of options and I feel like we tried most of them due to the small-plate tapas format. The salsas were good but our chips (totopos) while tasted good, were so greasy. The guacamole was very tasty, but the artichoke chipotle dip needed some more kick. It was a little bland. The sopes were good, but also seemed to lack a punch of flavor. The stuffed pepper was delicious, as were the empanadas. I think this is a great place to go to have some cocktails and an appetizer or two, but having dinner seemed a little awkward with all of these little plates sitting around everywhere and trying to figure out how to share them. The margaritas were good, but don\u2019t expect a margarita glass. They are served in small short cocktail glasses. For a real dinner, I personally like to have my own plate of food consisting of an entree and some sides. For anyone on a budget, keep in mind that your bill can easily sneak up on you. It\u2019s easy for a couple eating and having a couple of cocktails to run up over a $125+ tab in no time. The space itself is new and cool, but the acoustics are extremely bad. There is music playing, but you can\u2019t hear it. You do feel like you are hearing at least 50 conversations going on at the same time when it\u2019s busy. There is nothing to absorb the sound so it just bounces around everywhere. I think this could be a great addition to downtown with a little learning curve on how to best utilize what they offer.",

This is first and foremost a tapas restaurant. That said, many tapas restaurants expect you to share bites with the table, each person ordering something different. Apparently everything on the menu (except the designated \u201cshareables\u201d-a half chicken, a 16-Oz steak or short rib enchiladas, none of which I consider easily shareable unless you aren\u2019t very hungry, especially served with just tortillas) was Ala Carte. Despite the menu listing a plural item, you get one-see the Gorditas entry on the menu. But even though there were two ordering and we each ordered a different taco, they brought both small tacos (3\u201d tortillas) on one plate (at least should have provided a second plate or two smaller plates-we had to ask for a second plate). We also ordered Gorditas. They did bring these on individual plates. One Gordita per serving. Small Gordita. Very tough masa cake for my Gordita, which I had to cut with a knife, and much of the bottom of the masa cake was too tough too chew. On the positive side, service was decent, food came out fairly quickly, though I would rather the food all be brought at the same time. The flavors WERE very good! And the Paloma that Brent made was one of the best I\u2019ve had (but for $13 it should be). Value for $? I had a small taco, a small Gordita and a good drink for $26 before tip. I left hungry. One last word: several menu items are marked as Vegan on the menu but 4 of the 7 of those contain dairy, either cheese or cream, so if you are a strict vegan, read the menu carefully. They are new. Maybe they will make adjustments that improve the experience. I will try again and hopefully can give a better review.",

The concrete floors and open ceiling are what seem to be in vogue at the moment but make for a noisy experience. They have a full bar, several beers on tap and two TVs.  The menu is heavily oriented toward tapas with some enticing twists. We ordered three tacos and a side of beans and rice (I miss Chiefs' table). With one coffee and water, the bill came to just over $35.  A bit on the pricey side, but for that price we expected great things.  What we got was just okay. My wife felt the chips were stale, the tacos were barely warm and the beans and rice cold. We were both taken aback by tiny portions of rice and beans at over $5 each.  Our waitress was very nice, but rarely seen. She never refilled my wife's water and I had to ask twice for a refill on coffee and twice for the check, with extended wait times between each request.  We'll probably try them again after they have had some time to work out these issues.",

Our server was knowledgeable with the food menu and offered some of his favorites. Food (10/10): We choose to try the Tamala oaxaque\u00f1o, artichoke and chorizo dip,  empanadas de carne, and tacos: Pollo el pastor, baja style mahi, and the shortrib (can't remember the name). Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavors were complicated but worked incredibly well and seemed to develop more after each bite. Drink (10/10): For adult libations we had Brent, one of the areas best bartenders that we've frequently had incredible cocktails from, make us a seasonal Gin cocktail.  I'm not 100% sure what was in it besides Bombay Sapphire, Grapefruit, either a rubarb syrup or aperol, and it garnished with orange peel essence and a slightly smoked rosemary twig for aromatics. Overall (10/10): We thoroughly enjoyed our first visit, we will be back within a week to try out the rest of the menu. This restaurant is something that everyone should try as it easily has some of the most developed flavors in the downtown area.",

The Tuna alone was worth the trip!  I'd personally comment on the Tacos, but since my wife wouldn't share, I just have to assume they were excellent.   Great place to socialize with a wonderful atmosphere,  super friendly staff and phenomenal food.  Thank you Lauren for the invite.  We will be back!",

        "caption": "In downtown Huntsville, a mashup of Mexican, Tex/Mex in an open and airy casual industrial eatery. La Esquina Cocina means \"the corner kitchen\" and true to its name offers everything from scratch chicken soup to aged NY Strip Steak.  A creative menu with plenty of options with veg based plates, several chicken plates, a few fish and of course several pork and beef choices.  One of their sharable selections (chicken and the short ribs are our favorite ) with a couple single plates make for a great meal.  A couple notes - we're not drinkers but the bar set up looked outstanding - and they support several local farms providing cheese, vegs and meats. While open just a little later than most - check the hours daily - I'll still add this as a great addition to Huntsville's short supply of food choices for those of us who prefer a later sitting.",
