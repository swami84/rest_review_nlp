Our server was OK, not sure if he was just having a bad day or not but it seems like all servers were just run around trying to get people served and out of there, kind of a buffet style in a Chinese restaurant.

What I will say for those who don\u2019t know anything about Nobu, it is a luxurious experience in dining with dishes meant to be shared so I wouldn\u2019t go to this kind of restaurant if you are hungry looking for a hearty meal.

Stopped by recently with family and we had the seared salmon, Alaskan black cod, mushroom toban yaki with truffle, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Whitefish Dry Miso, King Crab Taco, Organic greens with seared tuna and salmon sashimi, and the beef tenderloin. The cod here is amazing just like I've had in the past. The fish and skin were cooked perfectly. The beef tenderloin was so tender and buttery. The mushrooms with truffle were surprisingly amazing. Overall, food here is great just can't justify the price. Fish quality wise its the same as other top sushi spots in the area. Don't believe the hype when you break the bank here expect to still leave hungry.",

I went for happy hour, which offers a less expensive menu of shareable plates and some drink specials, three cocktails and a few beer and wine selections. While the drinks were good, they were not particularly strong, and thus didn't provide a great happy hour value. I liked the sidecar made with Japanese whiskey and the cucumber martini. In addition to the meh drink specials, the food was just not that great. They have \"tacos,\" which seem very reasonably priced at first glance. But then when you get them they are about an inch and a half long. The sushi, at $12 for 2 rolls, was very ordinary and just not what would be expected from a high-end restaurant. The only thing that was good was that the service was friendly, patient, and helpful. But then, the server was also overworked and so drinks would often take quite a while to come out. So overall, a disappointment.",

Although the restaurant opens at 5:00PM, the host won't allow you sit at the sushi bar or other parts of the restaurant until 6:00PM, so you have to wait by the bar area if you want to be seated on the restaurant side. Instead of waiting for an hour, I decided to just sit by the bar side and ordered the Chef's Omakase.  The good: The food looked was displayed beautifully and it made the dish look delicious! I enjoyed the nigiris, salmon with caviar, and the desserts. The sweet ebi had a good sweetness to it, and the head was crunchy. The nigiri pieces were soft and tasty, and didn't have a lot of rice. The salmon with caviar was delicious. The Panna Cotta dessert was delicious! I would definitely return to order the Panna Cotta.  The bad: Most of the food was salty. Even though it looked delicious, it failed to meet my standard of taste. For the price of Omakase, I was expecting it to exceed expectations considering it's a well known chain. I wouldn't recommend ordering the Omakase. Service was really slow, since we asked multiple waiters for tea, and it took 10 - 15 minutes for it to arrive.  Overall, the presentation is beautiful, but the taste is subpar. Even if the Omakase wasn't pricey, it is not worth ordering. The highlight was the Panna Cotta!",

In addition, we got the wagyu foie gras dumplings which are to die for. - Last but not least, parking was a breeze because of valet service. A great plus.

My advice is to NOT attempt to decode the menu... let your wait person bring you what they suggest and trust them.

We had a mix of Nobu classics and DC specific items. It's a little bit out of the way but not far from Georgetown and right in the West End. Definitely worth the trip. The atmosphere and music is right on point. We chose the custom menu, with a few requests and mostly full trust in our server. The food hits the spot with a mix of Peruvian and Japanese dining. My only complaint was that the first 5 items were all some sort of carpaccio. While I love this dish, it seemed a little over used, to have the same presentation style. Overall, would recommend to anyone. Will be back and feeling very grateful for the awesome experience and adventure.  My favorite dish was the Chilean sea bass. It was cooked to absolute perfection. Smoky, creamy and delicious.",

Just amazing! All the food we had was great, one odd thing was, in the middle of our course tasting(not the beginning) we got a salad. Dont get me wrong, the salad was great but me and hubby thought it was odd. The reason I gave 4 stars is not the food, it's the service. Our server was callous in explaining the menu to us and it was our first time here. We asked him to recommend vegetarian options and he pointed us to the last page and said that's all we have and left. We went over the menu and saw there were many options to choose from along with the pre-fix. We also did not like how the server got the credit card charger to us, asks for a tip first before swiping the card standing right in front of us (give us some space to go over what we had and how we were served). This is not what we expected from a restaurant like Nobu. We expected top notch service here as it's such a well renowned restaurant with great chef and reputation. I hope they improve the service. Other than that, the food is just phenomenal.",

Our service started out well, but halfway into the meal our servers forgot us and it took maybe 15-20 minutes between bringing our courses. We were seated at a table with bright evening sun shining into my eyes... I asked if there was a window shade... there was none. Instead of offering a different table the hostess suggested I switch seats with someone else in our party! The menu selections are quite limited, and most are priced by the \"piece\". Dinners are all served \"family style\" with the food placed in the middle of the table and shared by all. We had an $900 bill for 7 people, and I still left hungry.  Never Nobu again for me!!",

We were so glad we did. The food was really excellent and we were so focused on it, the service was not much on our radar. That said, we thought the service was fine and not overbearing, but we were not ignored. Definitely good for a date or dinner with friends! We did the chef's tasting menu, which always proves to be an adventure. We had some combinations we never thought we'd see that were sublime. And the tuna sashimi was so good I closed my eyes while I ate it and tried to savor it for as long as humanly possible. The waitress and bartender were helpful in pairing sake with our meal. The restaurant is nice looking and rather large, though the ceilings seem low. It is definitely bustling. A fun place and more importantly, a decadent, delicious foodie destination.",

It seems like it is in a residential neighborhood, fairly close to Historic Georgetown.  That said, there was no valet and we ended up walking from several blocks away, which given the weather was an annoyance.  Ambience inside reminded me of an asia food court.  We came in and rather then wait for a table we ended up sitting at the bar to dine.  This is what made our night.  I have been at Nobus all across the world, London, Munich, Milan, etc and regulary dine at Michelin starred restaurants and have never had better service then with your bartender Michael.  He reminded me of a movie bartender, fit, handsome and was seemed very intelligent and well read.  Our discussion varied about different spirits, then about the difference between wagyu and washu, and listened to him speak with the couple next to us about how King Phillip was the only reason Alexander ever had the opportunity to be great.  Very fun night and quite an education with him, he made our night.   As for the food, it was less then what I expected when I come to Nobu and the Wagyu dumpling were much to greasy for me.  Food came out in the right order, but seemed to take longer between some courses.   Overall experience was excellent, due to service.",

Both locations were great and so we were happy when the DC location opened. Made reservations to go there for early dinner on a Friday evening, but on the day of, I received a call from the restaurant confirming the reservations, but also reminding us that we have to be done by a certain time because of their second seating!   This was a first for me; I can honestly say that I have never had any place do that.  To me, that is the opposite of hospitality: do you ask your guests when they are leaving before they arrive??? The girl on the phone was unable to answer that question!  As far as I\u2019m concerned, no restaurant is worth it; certainly not Nobu. This kind of (non) service, even before one arrives, can only mean one thing, worse service once you get there. So, I canceled our reservations and we\u2019re happy to take our appetites and money somewhere where they\u2019ll be appreciated!",

After a debacle with our bill and an incompetent waiter who overcharged us by \u201ccreating a family style dining experience\u201d, (one of us charged $350 while two others $120 and $200 for the same size portion/entree I ordered for myself so 1 order split for 3 people) we complained to the manager and were given a $200 credit for another shot at dining there.  Well, same results: food was good and service not so much.   Food came out inconsistently and while one of us got a plate, everyone else sat there waiting for long periods of time with nothing.  Entrees came out for others while a few hadn\u2019t even received their starters.  Bottom line, they said that\u2019s how the kitchens works.  What?  Not acceptable.  I\u2019ve been to other Nobu locations and by far, the staff seemed not to standard of price point of Nobu and the inconsistency and confusion over our orders left us frustrated.  I won\u2019t return to the DC location.  Will be interested to see if this Nobu makes it in this government town.",

I've dined at Nobu Miami and Nobu Las Vegas and to say the least Nobu D.C. just doesn't compare. To start there is no valet available. After circling the block several times we found a space a block away. When we entered the building how surprised/disappointed was I to find that that restaurant doesn't have the Asian theme that the other locations have. Therefore, ambience just isn't the same.  We had reservations so we were seated very quickly. We had a table for two but the tables were so close that I had to excuse myself to slide between our table and the neighbors not to bump it. We could have just been seated together at a 4 top table. Once seated the first thing I noticed was the disposable wooden chopsticks that needed to be pulled from the paper and snapped apart in order to be used. I have had better chopsticks from a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant at gallery place/China town. Also, the wait staff at this location is dressed more casual than what I remember at the other locations. Although they wear black shirts and pants they didn't have the jackets or ties that the other locations wear. After asking if we had dined at Nobu before the waiter offered us the Nobu traditional ordering style which we agreed to. It's a process where they ask you a few questions to familiarize themselves with your flavor palette and food preferences and they come up with a dining menu for your table. Everything was just fine until he asked the final question... \"my final question is, what is your price point for this meal?\" \"Excuse me??\" I asked. He went on to explain that some items are market priced and he didn't want to exceed our budget. Needless to say, I was appalled.  I reassured him that we were prepared to pay for all items that are served and then reiterated that this was NOT our first time dining at Nobu.  We ordered Edamame; King Crab Tempura; Miso Chilean Sea bass; 4oz of Wagu beef, and a side of Miso Wild Mushrooms. The food took a while to come out but it was good. Again not the best I've had from Nobu and by the time we got to the food I was so disappointed that I just wanted to eat quickly and move on with our evening to my next birthday festivity. I will not be coming back. I would rather fly 2hrs  to Miami have dinner and come back the same day than to dine there again.",

The whole dining experience from the moment we walked through the door to the time we departed, it was a wonderful evening. The staff were courteous and very attentive to our every need. The timing of the food was impeccable, as our plate was finished and cleared away, a new one would arrive with a wonderful explanation of the new dish. I would like to praise the Bar Manager Thuy Hong who helped us in our selection of dishes, from a very nice menu. Everything chosen was perfectly presented and tasted wonderful of the seven plates we chose, it was to difficult to pick a winner. Will definitely be going back.",

Japanese Peruvian cuisine sounds odd, but Nobu is a genius melding of spice and sushi. All of the sashimi is amazing! And the edamame appetizer, again with the spice, was inventive and tasty. But the crispy rice was a little chewy/gummy, and the lobster tacos didn't have much flavor. I also discovered that I don't like raw scallops, but that's not Nobu's fault. Their signature cocktail, the \"25th & M\",  is delicious - tequila, dill, habanero... who would think of this combo?! So good! I will definitely be going back there for special occasions. I don't understand the reviews that are critical of the neighborhood and the building. It's located on the edge of Georgetown, which I appreciate - less pedestrian traffic and not a nightmare to drive there.  It's in the ground floor of a typical DC office building, nothing warehouse-y about it. The interior is spacious, not too noisy, and the tables are not butted up against each other, which I also appreciate. Shout out to our server, Matthew! Terrific energy, and expert guidance on our menu choices. Thank you!",

        "caption": "No Noboo, no. A 5* name with a rather less than spectacular establishment- a chain that's a status symbol. Nobu who is now about 70 years old probably has nothing to do with the restaurants themselves.  Our server was a nice guy but overwhelming. He was pushy to the point it got really annoying and unpleasant. We tried several things and everytime we ordered one of each, he would say \"Are you sure you don't want 2? It's only 1 piece, are you sure?\". Um yeah dude, we're sure. He also didn't know the answers to a lot of my questions and had to run and ask the chef. They tried so hard here that it became intrusive and confusing. But hey, it's opening week- service can and most the time does improve so let's move past all this and onto what's important, the food!  Most wasabi in America is a mixture of ingredients that is designed to replicate the taste of real wasabi. Usually horseradish & food coloring. Tonight it was horseradish & wasabi powder. Awesome. No, really- it was \"awesome\".  Nigiri is one type of sushi that should be eaten with your hands and not your chopsticks. You should never dip the rice portion into soy sauce so you don't overpower the seasoning of the rice. It's my favorite type. People focus on the quality of the fish in producing sushi- but it's the sushi rice that really matters the most. Sushi rice should be served body temperature, not room temperature or chilled. When you get substandard rice, you're not getting a quality sushi experience. Nobu's rice was a dissapointment. It was a little mushy and a bit sweet. So what did I do that I never do?! Dip it in soy sauce! Because sodium makes everything that doesn't taste good taste better. The mediocre quality of the fish didn't help either. I was sad, like a boy who was so excited to go to a candy store only to not get candy. Because sushi is not what I received.  All the other dishes were all subpar. The tempura had too much batter, the shitake mushroom salad tasted like something I get 3 times a week at Modern Market, lobster ceviche was good but there was 2 bites to it, the tacos- now these bad boys were literally the size of a nacho for $10 (but they were good, my favorite part of the night but surely not worth it), the shrimp tempura roll was great- I enjoyed it, the vegetable roll was utterly tasteless (Wholefoods does it better and that's sad), eggplant was eggplant with sweet sauce on top, and miso soup was salty. Most restaurant can't make a good miso soup anyhow so I didn't expect much.  But hey- go, do it, try it, so you can tell all your friends you went to Nobu. But keep your expectations low and your wallet loaded. For you shall spend what is known as \"hard earned money\" so you can leave saying no to NoBoo.",
