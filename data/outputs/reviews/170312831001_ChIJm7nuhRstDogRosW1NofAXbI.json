I do my best not to write bad reviews but, I don't want anyone to waste their money; there are better places to eat Mediterranean foods. I bought the chicken shawerma sandwich it was dripping in tahini sauce it did not taste good. The Faleel had an awful taste it was the worst I've ever had. The Hummus was not best but everything else I bought was not edible this was a waste of $31.78. I wouldn't eat there again, I've wondered why they don't have many customers - I got my answer today. While in this pandemic I've been trying to give restaurants business but,  I think Couscous gave me the business today.",
