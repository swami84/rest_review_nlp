The main issue was the fact that they were out of most beers on the menu we tried to order, along with lobster, and apparently we had ordered the last of the crab too. When you go out to pay for a meal, the experience should be pleasant and seamless. It was tolerable at best. Not a fan at all of the staff allowing friends/ patrons / other staff disturb the peace with loud phone calls, fighting, and noise inside the restaurant. Yikes! Please get it together........",

Upon arriving there were socially distant tables outside and it was gorgeous out so it was super enjoyable.  Had the Rum Punch and it was strong and tasty. I ordered the Rasta Pasta and it was sooo good, just enough kick and the sauce was top notch. Loved it so much, my friend had some of mine and decided to get one to go!  Haven't been back yet to try additional food but my friends had the chicken which was slamming too. Plus the service we received was great.  Enjoyed my stay if I am in Crown Heights again I will stop by!",

I informed him, I know for sure what I ate and confident it was from the fish. Also just because it may be the first time you had a customer get hives from your food does not mean it didn't happen.  Then he says he sorry it happen to me but its hard to know it was from their food since there is no proof, so he can't issue a refund and walks off.

The Mac n cheese was cold, they messed up my King\u2019s combo order because they do not read specifications when ordering from apps!!!!!!!  Also the bun to the salmon sliders was hard and stale .......  I had such high expectations and unfortunately I threw $116 down the toilet.....  Never again!!!!!",

The mussel dish that is $15 consisted of only 12 mussels on a plate. That is $1.25 per mussel, even more expensive than their $1 oysters. And considering that there was only one more table taken, it was mind blowing that the waitress forgot half of our order. Not to mention that no one came to refill our water throughout the whole 40 min wait for the 12 mussels. I was excited for a new seafood place in the neighborhood, but it turned out to be a disappointment.",
