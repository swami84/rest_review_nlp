Will definitely be returning to try more. Would be cool if they could serve the miso soup in something other than a Styrofoam bowl, and could maybe tone down the saltiness, I always pass on it.  Lately I've been getting the dinner size for the higher price because they give much more food, and you can choose just brown rice and salad on the side.  They don't usually respect requests over the phone to forego the pastic bag, napkin or utensils unfortunately, would be nice if they asked you if you want them each time.  I've tried, the scallion pancake starter (delicious), and for lunch specials: green tea cold noodle (tasty but could have had some more ingredients than a single grape tomato), Mai Fun Noodle w/ fish cake, Red Curry Seitan, Malaysian Curry stew (excellent), and Eggplant & String beans (surprisingly incredible sauce).",

Various plant based appetizers, entrees, soups, and even desserts to quench your vegan appetite! Every dish I've tried was delicious. I recommend the vegan chocolate cake with your order. It was perfectly moist. The cost is on the higher end of vegan asian cuisine, however it is likely you will be highly satisfied with the items of your choice. Also... customer service perhaps needs improvement, however again, it may be all worth it - in your experience. It's located in a great, trendy neighborhood - though parking is quite limited. There are plenty of public transportation options nearby. They also accept 'call ahead' to place orders for pickup or delivery nearby. Overall, highly recommended.",

Today (03/03/19) My wife placed an order with DAO to have the food delivered. After 1.5 hours the food was not delivered. When I called for an update I was told that this is not their issue, that's an issue with uber and not them. I spoke to the teenage daughter of the owners, who refused to come on the line to assist with this issue. The level of customer service that I received was unacceptable and disappointing - as a long time customer they refuse to assist me with my issue/order. I ask the Teen if I can please speak to her mom regarding this issue, first she stated that her mom is not in.Two mins later I heard her in the background speaking in their native language. I ask can I please speak to someone in charge, I spend over $40 for this order and she refused.  I said is this the way you treat your long time customers? We place an order with you and it was not delivered, rather than try to help solve the issue and get this resolved, she was told to end the call because there is nothing she can do about this. I don't usually do reviews but this one was one that needed to be addressed, I lost all respect for such establishment, there are many other alternatives available to treat a loyal and long time customer like this.",

So why not combine these three and bring your love interest to this hidden vegetarian Thai heaven on Flatbush?  Here's your three-step seduction plan:  [Step 1] Order the Tom Yum Soup. This bold and beautiful classic at Dao Palate is the best I've ever had of its kind. Oh boy, the moment this passionate potion hits your tongue, the tartness of the lemongrass and the warmth of the chili will instantly melt you into a doe-eyed kitten.Speaking of first impression, guys!  [Step 2] Order something creamy and gentle (read: coconut) to balance off the soup. I made the mistake of getting green papaya salad as a chaser. The salad tasted rather bland after the soup. So take note!  [Step 3] Order Mango Sorbet to top it off. We agreed on this at the beginning of this review.  All my empty plates are cleared within 10 seconds. Water is also instantly refilled, which is super important in summer.  The entire menu is vegan so I can't wait to bring all my friends here.  Now I know where to go when I forget again that Guido is closed on Mondays.",
