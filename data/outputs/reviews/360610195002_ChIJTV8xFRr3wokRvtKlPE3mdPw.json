They've adapted very well to the pandemic, and, as of November 2020, there are multiple tables for indoor dining (divided by plexiglass barriers), and the perimeter is heated for the tables outside. The cocktail menu is short, and absolutely delicious. The pizza is -very- good. Thin crust, perfectly cooked crust, and well portioned. Highly recommend the vodka pizza (yes, vodka sauce). The pasta dishes are classic recipes this restaurant does very well. AND THEY DELIVER. In my experience, actual delivery times are much better than advertised",

We were EXCEPTIONALLY pleased with the care and attention the owner Piero of FUMO gave to our event.  The room was ready on time and set up perfectly. The appetizers came out on time hot and delicious, spicy calamari, a choice of pizza\u2019s, and rice balls.  They generously kept the drinks flowing as the staff was very attentive.  Our first course included two salad and pasta. The main course Salmon and Chicken Marsala.  The owner made the great suggestion that everything be served family style so no one had to choose and could eat everything. It was the RIGHT DECISION.  THERE WAS SO MUCH FOOD \u2013 and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  We received SO many compliments on the food.  The team worked very well together and handled several special requests (for vegans and vegetarians). The space is PERFECT for a private event up to 60 people (they have a side room).  Bright and airy \u2013 and brand new it leant towards a good feeling for all. Our guests left smiling and we felt we got REAL VALUE.  I would highly recommend for a private event.",

I love personal pizzas with fresh ingredients made live before my eyes. I try the happy hr once and it was pretty good deal of beer and wine. I spent only $30 for 5 drinks and they were quality drinks.  For dinner i had a pizza it was a no brainer for me on my first time. Ill try the pastas next. I ve seen guests i m chatting with at the bar indulge on the pasta like there was no tomorrow lol so i assume its good.  The decor and ambience is very cozy. I like the dimmed candle lights and glass walls that makes it opened and a lots of plants give it that greenhouse atrium like feel. I get the old italian brasserie like mix with fresh breezy airy warm tropical and romantic Mediterranean feel. Really. Perfect for dates, meeting with parents and hang out with friends for a nice meal and drinks at the table.  Looking forward to trying your menu and special in the future.  Xo",

I love the menu, it is simple offering a nice verity of freshly prepared authentic Italian food. The appetizers-rice balls, spicy calamari, eggplant parm, are so delicious. The sauce tastes homemade, the bread is authentic Italian with perfect crust. Salads are great I personally love the baby kale Cesar salad. Main courses are all good, We love the steak and how it is prepared, chicken Marsala is the best we ever had because the mushrooms are fresh and have such a wonderful aroma. On weekend, brunch is a must, the chicken and waffles are so so good we actually talk about it at home, I also enjoy the avocado toast, but man ohhhhh man, chicken and waffles are da bomb! Pasta is always fresh and al dente, bolognese tastes so so good. All desserts are on point. I love Fumo, my family loves Fumo, we dine here every week and I hope we will for many years to come.",

Fumo had a lovely atmosphere that made me feel like I was in a real restaurant. But people in the restaurant were not loud, neither was the music. The service was lovely. It really stood out because the waiter that I had was cheerful and friendly, and he really explained the dishes in a good way that really stood out to me. Now on to the food. The food was really good. I had the meatballs and some pizza, and both were delicious. The meatballs tasted like meatballs that I would get from a really good Italian restaurant. The sauce around them was also really good. There were I believe 4 or 5 meatballs in the bowl. The pizza tasted really good. It was warm, and had an equal amount of cheese and tomato sauce. It was a Neapolitan pizza pie, and it was really good. The Shirley Temple tasted like the Shirley Temple at Cafe Du Soleil. Sweet. Really sweet. The tables were not good. They were very slippery. Someone should fix the tables there. The price was pretty good for the quality of the food. The price of one dish goes from $12-25$. That is pretty good.",
