        "caption": "Meat is an extremely high end restaurant and definitely lives up to that reputation. We ordered lamb tongue, and veal sweet breads as appetizers and both were absolutely out of this world. The thing that annoyed me though was there main course. They have a very small selection of meat, and all of them (except for one hanger steak) are their dry-aged steaks which cost an absolute fortune. My wife wanted to order a lamb shoulder for herself and I was gonna order a steak but the smallest steak they had available was a 37 Oz Dry Aged steak which at $4.50 an ounce came out to $166! Which in my opinion is absolutely insane. And again, this was literally the cheapest option, except for their hanger steak. Now the 37-oz steak is quite large, but included in the 37 oz is an absolute massive bone, and another huge marrow bone so in reality the beef is much less than that... So we ended up splitting the steak which ended up being sufficient for both of us but not by a lot. In total, we ordered two appetizers, one main, and one drink, and our bill was over $300. To me that's a little crazy. However I must say, the dry aged steak was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. It was unbelievable. Their steak is literally incomparable to a regular steak. Totally different stratosphere... I also think they can brush up on their dessert menu. It came across as trying to be a little too sophisticated, but just resulting in a lame and dull selection. My cocktail was very solid too. The food decor and plating is stunning and the ambiance is beautiful, comfy, and romantic. The service is quite good as well. Ryan was especially nice and helpful. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience, and if you have a really special occasion, I would say, take out a mortgage, come on over, and give it a shot, but for me personally, I can't see myself coming back here too quickly, simply because of the astronomical cost. At the very least they should have more options such as a regular rib eye which doesn't cost $166 for the smallest steak.",

The ambiance is spot on. The service was excellent, very attentive staff but not too intrusive. The menu is limited, but I felt the choices were varied for what they were offering. After ordering a bunch of appetizers to share, we were all full but ordered mains which they smartly took awhile to send to allow our stomachs to settle. Everything was superb and very flavorful. I liked the bathroom and the mural on the wall. I judge a restaurant on their bathroom, and this one was comfortable, smelled nice and most importantly- clean. It is very relaxing here and even sitting close to the bar with people coming in and out we were able to have private conversations and feel cozy. The music was a bit loud but after we asked them to lower it they quickly accommodated us. I would recommend this restaurant for a nice evening out with friends or your spouse.",

The food is decent, but for the price you pay you can get much better food elsewhere in Brooklyn, and let alone Manhattan. The restaurant was empty, but since we didn't make a reservation the matradee required us to sit upfront near the entrance. He made it sound like he is doing us a huge favor by serving us food altogether, notwithstanding that the store was empty and overpriced.

But there are plenty of them in Midwood or in Manhattan that I consider to be a better bang for the buck, like Reserve Cut or Barnea.  We came here on a busy Thursday night with a group of about ten people. Meat is located in a tricky area and they needed a security guard in front. The waiter didn't speak much English and seemed busy. While all of the appetizers were excellent, my drink didn't show up for about an hour.  It seemed to me like the kitchen was doing its job, while the service was what was lacking. Plus, we were with a girl who said she was there twice last week and was treated like the Queen of England. So maybe we were just unlucky. When we complained they gave us some things on the house, so that was nice.  That all said, the steaks were excellent. This is despite the fact that the waiter only described them as \"27\" and \"35\", and despite the fact that we got them late and almost cold. No description on the cut of meat, no prices, and no question about how we liked it cooked. In general, there was definitely a lack of ability for the waiter to explain the complex food they were serving. Usually in an elegant steakhouse they will show you the cut of meat or describe it. At Meat, they did nothing but tell you the weight. Also, they were out of steaks below 27 ounces - good luck trying to get a fillet mignon. Also, our steaks were around $165 each.  The salads were excellent and the dips on the bread were very creative. The chocolate dessert was cool, although the tahini ice cream was a bit weird.  The drinks were lacking. Four cocktails to choose from is not nearly enough considering you have a full bar, and where's the Old Fashioned or Manhattan people are used to at a real steakhouse? Also, they had beers but beers were not listed on the menu - could really benefit from some good craft beer. All in all, not a place I would trek out to again, but maybe a place I could be convinced into giving another shot.",
