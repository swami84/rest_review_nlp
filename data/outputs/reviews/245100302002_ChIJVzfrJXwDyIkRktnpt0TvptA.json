We get there 10 mins prior to our reservation and was told we were checked in but still had to wait to be seated. It didn't become an issues until we were standing there waiting for at least 30 mins after our reservation time. As we were we standing there I noticed several other parties of two, three, and four also coming in for reservations at 9 as well. .... what is the point of a reservation if I can't be seated at the exact time?? When we were finally seated at a table, it took a while for anyone to come to the table. When he finally came, he took drink orders and brought the wrong drinks. We ordered our food so we wouldn't have to wait and we ended up waiting an additional 30 mins for our food. I ordered a steak with the lobster mac n cheese and the grilled asparagus. My asparagus was cold. The lobster mac n cheese needed more seasoning. I felt as if the food was cooked and rushed because the kitchen closed at 10. I was really looking forward to dining here, but the experience wasn't even worth the time and money. I will not be returning to this location.",

She walked us through the entire menu. Knew it by heart, including ingredients, cuts, where the meat came from. It's like you couldn't stump her in detail. Menu was pretty straight forward. One page, as most restaurants are doing in these Covid-19 times, trying to simplify. The food was delicious and cave out quick. Everything on the menu is \u00e0 la carte which add up quickly in price, but I feel it was worth it. Restaurants ambiance was perfect. Booth seating was plush and comfortable. Again, great experience and if I'm ever out there again I most definitely will go back.",

Andrew the manager mentioned this to me when he introduced himself which was a considerate gesture.  The food, the service, and the personal connection at this location has been second to none.  I travel for a living and have many trepidations about dining out. The Baltimore location comes with nice people and a very safe environment.  It seems like the staff there care about each other, the customers, and your business...which is a rare combo.  I work for the NFL and eat at the Indy location every year during our Scouting Combine.

I ordered the sea scallops I can't quite remember the price but it was priced between $37-42 on my plate were 5 scallops a lemon wedge and parsley garnish and the plate was lukewarm. But it did taste fairly well I will say that much. I also had the asparagus which was $13 for 7 spears. My wife ordered shrimp scampi at a similar price the plate was Mohave dessert dry the pasta looked like Ramen and the shrimp were over cooked scampi is supposed to saturated in garlic butter right? DRRRRRRYYYYYY!!. My uncle ordered the chefs crab cakes(we live in Baltimore) the dish was priced above $40 for 2 SLIGHTLY larger than golfball sized almost non seasoned crab cakes. I wish I knew Chef Gordon Ramsey personally, I would unleash him on this place in a glorious display of wrath and vengeance. The food could have been seasoned better with larger portions atleast. I didn't list everyone out of our party of 12 but needless to say we were all disappointed with our experience and had to go elsewhere to get our fill. The best part of the night was the $15 cocktail it was small but it was awesome so if I went back it would be for the drinks.",

Everything was full of flavor and so tender. I am a truck driver so I not able to spend much time with my fiance. The guy working at the front who seated us acknowledged that we were celebrating a late valentine's day so he went to the back and got a menu from valentine's day week that was wrapped up in a bow. That meant a lot to us. The service was excellent and i would recommend anyone to dine at this place.",

But man, for the prices they charge people should expect to be AMAZED.  And my experience tonight was far from that.  My wife ordered the \"diver\" scallops, and at $40 for 5 quarter-sized scallops by themselves on a plate they should have been just the best darn scallops we ever had. They were so ordinary it was painful. 6 sticks of grilled asparagus for $12?  They should be way better than what I'd expect from the Olive Garden, and they weren't. Our server just didn't have the time to tend to our table properly (multiple empty drinks in front of us, the wrong items being served to the wrong people, etc.)  I honestly don't think it was his fault, but from the customers point of view does it matter?  All in all, it was a very ordinary dinner with very ordinary service, in a fancy-decor restaurant with exorbitant prices.  If you have a corporate card burning a hole in your pocket and want to impress your clients by showing them how irresponsibly you can spend the company's money, then this is a great spot.  If you want to spend real money on a memorable dining experience, there are FAR better options in Baltimore.",

Next our food was delightful. The chef special, Chilean seabass with seared scallops and crabmeat on top was to die for. I love Chilean seabass and this one was well prepared and the flavor of the fish was complemented by the other seafood and not over powered as can happen with some flavors.  It was just a great seafood meal. It really should be on the regular menu. If it was, I would probably get it every time.  We shared a side of the Gouda mac and cheese. A perfect accompaniment for our meal  I look forward to visiting again.",

We were seated at a beautiful round table with great lighting. The quality and freshness of the food was top notch. We chose a mix of hot and cold appetizer which included cracked snow crab legs, tuna sashimi, crab cakes and shrimp cocktails. Which was all served by hand. I chose a filet topped with crab cakes. Sides are family style and we chose steamed spinach, risotto, mashed potatoes. For dessert we had baked Alaska and cookies. Can't say enough.",

But  on this outing for the what we paid we wish we had made ourselves like something on the Restaurant Week menu.  As we were waiting for our car out front two women also waiting for their vehicle were saying the same exact thing.  Then to make matters worse when the guy bought my truck around all we smelled was WEED...the dude smelled like weed and so did my truck all the way home we made to ride with the windows down to air it out.

It is important to me because I have been in fancy places where they put you like sardines and there is no privacy. As for food I think Oysters Rockefeller were outstanding. The main dishes (scallops) were delicious. I could not find a blemish even if I tried to so 5 stars for the great evening. Maybe prices might be lower but then again you pay for the food, service & ambiance. We will be back soon hopefully.",

Both seafood and steaks are great, the staff is really very friendly and - and this made me give it the extra star - nearby places like the Bygone and the Charleston are difficult to get into, impossible on short notice, while here I can walk in whenever I want. Again, the menu is standard seafood/steak house, but what they do they do very well. Last Thursday I had a dinner consisting of a jumbo shrimp cocktal, a wagyu filet and giant shrimp from Madagascar (!). Simple, but excellent! Fresh, tasty and perfectly prepared. Finally, the wine selection may not be huge, but they do have  Ch. de Beaucastel 1998 (where else do you find that?) and Gaja Barbaresco 2013 for extremely fair prices.",

Service was not good either with the waiter barely checking on us and missed one of our orders. Still paid for a very overpriced meal that we did not even finish. The raw bar was bland and the cooked dishes\u2019 tastes were making me nauseous. This is the second time that I have been here. I did not feel the restaurant was special in any way the first time and this time was just a huge disappointment.",

I was able to run into an old coworker (Townepark valet- Todd) who took my car for the evening when we pulled up to restaurant. We made reservations for 8 and still had to wait for about 5 min to be seated. We were handed both a regular menu and restaurant week menu.  We were given ample time to review the menu and we ordered for our starters, the friend calamari and my husband had the beet and kale salad. Both items were good, but I was caught off guard by the spice or (come to find out later the jalepeno) fried with the calamari as well as they masked a lemon slice by frying it and putting in with the calamari. It is was so dark that I didn't noticed the lemon fried in with the calamari instead of it being a garnished on the side. 2nd entree we ordered the Canadian Salmon and m husband had the paella. Food was warm not hot as the plates. My salmon was cooked perfectly and hot other than the risotto which was cold. Finally for our 3rd choice we both had the apple bread pudding. I asked is it serve hot  and was told it is served warm, which came out cold.  Other than that everything was good as farvad taste.  I am willing to come back but was shocked to find a glass of ginger ale was just about $5!\ud83e\udd28",

The lobster was burned by the grill. I could only taste the grill! Needless to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it at all. My sister asked for her steak to be medium rare. However she had to send the steak back because it was over cooked. She complained that it was hard to chew and hurt her teeth. The manager apologized for the steak. However she said there was nothing wrong with the lobster it was supposed to be burnt. My sister and I decided that it was an experience but we would not be returning! The food is mediocre at best! On the positive side I will say the decor and ambiance is nice! It is quite and the waitstaff is very professional. Also the bread is very tasty.",

This was our first time visiting and I was extemely excited.  I still gave this place 5 stars however the hostess was dry and unwelcoming.  I asked about valet and his lack of enthusiasm made me want to leave.  I'm glad I stayed because Howard made up for the hostess lack of personality.  The Calamari was the best ever.  The salads are a meal within itself.  Crab cakes were seasoned nicely..",

I'm only giving it 4 starts because my salmon came with rice that was so undercooked and crunchy that it almost looked as if they forget to cook it!
