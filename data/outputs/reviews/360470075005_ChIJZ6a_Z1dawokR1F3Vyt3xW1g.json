Funny story, he has a statue in the restaurant of a waiter and my son developed such a fear for it that we didn't go back for a while. A few years later I still get a kick out of it. I should come back more often. Overall good food good people.",

The pasta was incredibly delicious - like, yes, shockingly good - and the pizza was really amazing as well. the ravioli is truly to die for. we will be eating here again!!",

The pizza we ordered had a terrific hand tossed, and crispy crust.  It was well seasoned, and flavorful.  The tiramisu we had for dessert was light, airy, and sweet.  Everthing was simply delicious.  Edward our server was friendly, courteous, and attentive.  We enjoyed our experience so much we went back twice.  Highly Recommend!",

The crispy crust is slightly charred and adds to the flavours of basil and mozzarella. We finished with freshly filled ricotta cannolli.",

When I finally convinced them to do dinner here they were amazed at the food. Everything from the brick oven pizza, Penne vodka and eggplant is ridiculous. I always want to thank the amazing staff, they were patient with our family and gave them that little sass that these old school sicilians love. I give this place 5 stars, Great food, great ambiance and great staff.",
