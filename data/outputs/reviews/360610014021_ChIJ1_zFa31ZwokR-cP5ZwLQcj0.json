Loved the overall space of the market's new digs. In particular I enjoyed my interactions with the staff at Dominican Cravings, the young lady helping me was patient explaining what was what as I'm not Dominican (if you can't tell from the pic I'm just another middle aged white guy). I had not had any breakfast so I tried the mang\u00fa, which was mashed plantains with fried salami, fried cheese and eggs. As a transplant from the American South it fit my dietary preferences for fat fried and greasy, health nuts need not even bother. All the empanadas from here are great, I think I've tried all the flavors by now (my wife has picked them up and brought them home before.",

AND the last time I was here the staff seemed to be arguing with one another and a bunch of customers including myself were kept waiting while they sussed that all out. not super professional imo, but the food is so good so whatevz.  drops mic cuz i'm toasting' with these tostones",
