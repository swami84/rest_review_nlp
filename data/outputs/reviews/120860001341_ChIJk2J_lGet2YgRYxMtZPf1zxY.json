We arrive and we sit down and we look at the menu and I ask how much was a glass of wine and the waiter's favorite was tall $14 dollars and then we order food and I order a vchop which it was $44 dollars on the menu. The service was laussy and the waiter was very impolite.  But in the in  start to be friendly and I left him good tip. My wife order a pasta with sauce and she had intoxicated and she threw out. I pay the bill and was over charge. Next day a call the manager but he wasn't in so I left h a message with an employee and left my number to call me back and the manager never call me back. I think that's not the way to threat a customer. I am very disappointed because it is a four and a half star restaurant.",

When we kept sitting, the manger came to ask if we need coffee or anything else. I'm aware it is a busy Saturday night, but this is  a relative expensive restaurant and neither us nor our friends  enjoyed being rushed out and for this matter the whole dinning experience. oh yes , the food. The salad which 3 of us tasted was sent back, the  veal chop Milanese was excellent, the rest just mediocre. and one last remark. My friend asked for a glass of Cabernet. The  waiter offered 2 options and recommended one without specifying the price or referring her to the wine list. If anyone think that a bill of 25.00 a glass is reasonable,please go for it!",

I had a dinner with my family and friends from out of town.  The waiter was pitching us pasta with butter and white truffle and another meal with truffle but failed to mention it was almost $100.00 for each dish. Although it was a great dish, I was pretty disappointed when I received the bill. I did not say anything at the time  but decided to call today. Spoke to the manager and all he could say was that the policy is not to mention prices and that their price for truffle is below market. I believe at these price points you should give your customers the opportunity to decide if they want to pay $100.00 for a pasta dish like most other high end restaurants.",
