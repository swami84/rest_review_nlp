Looks pleasing delicious homemade oatmeal cookies. But it was quite the opposite....Easily crumble into little pieces was dried-up. These large oversize cookies were too greasy and tough at the edge led me to believe they were fried in oil not bake. So disappointed.... Make sure you buy water, you will certainly need it.",

The kisses are good they are made with meringue and are chocolate coated. Taste great with any coffee on their menu. A must stop if you're at or in the area of Dekalb Market  Couldn't post my video but some screenshots",

We randomly decided to give it a try when we visited Dekalb Market since the dessert display looked amazingly attractive.  We had Reese kisses (peanut butter flavored) and black & white cookie (a combination of original and chocolate chip). The kisses is a type of dessert from Europe which is made of creamy and dense meringue inside coated with a thin layer of chocolate. However, we didn\u2019t like the melted-in-mouth but greasy texture of meringue.  The black & white cookie was amazingly great. It was a smart idea to have 2 flavors and you won\u2019t have too much at one time. Their cookie was huge and perfect, we felt satisfied to share with 2 people.",
