Since I came during Chicago Restaurant week I ate from their prix fixe menu - It's nice that they included a drink! The margarita was good though the salt was on the side of the glass instead of on the rim. Everything else was just mediocre, the ceviche was more like a salad with dressing than a scoopable appetizer and I was unimpressed with the entr\u00e9e presentation. The service was okay too - we had no napkins, no utensils, and they ran out of straws. I understand that it was busy but that's the bare minimum that should be on a table. If you're into a more contemporary vibe and don't care for traditional Latin American food, this is the place for you.",

I believe the lack of attention to service was due to myself and my party being Black .I state this because of the attention to detail the staff gave the non Black patrons,which included the brunch special after being seated after us and the   manger taking extra good care and attention to a group of young girls whom he also took  shots with.

His intention became quite clear when he proceeded to say inappropriate things and trying to hit on us when it was clearly not wanted and we were visibly uncomfortable. He proceeded to then speak into my ear asking me to to bend over. His actions made my skin crawl and in no way was welcomed by my sister and I. I will never step foot in this establishment again.

The food was planned ahead of time and I am so happy that it was because it was nice not have to think about what to order. We had the trio of guacamole and I fell in love with the chips... they were pretty big which allowed for more guacamole to be eaten. We had so many tacos on our table... steak, pork belly and coconut shrimp - which was my favorite! And we also had their coconut rice which was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  When we first got there though, my coworker, that planned this dinner, and I had some aqua fresca (watermelon and the blood orange) and we ordered some octopus a la plancha. The octopus looked good on the plate when we received it but when we started eating it, it was surely overcooked because it was rubbery.  Also, the bartender wasn't that friendly... treated us like we weren't worth his time. I don't understand why he acted so cold to myself and my coworker. But whatever... we knew that we weren't going to be working with him once our tables were ready.  I might make the trip with some friends and the hubby to try it out again another time.",

We already had a reservation and since it was Friday night we couldn\u2019t find anywhere else to go, so we decided to stay. I showed her my open table reservation and she told me we would have to wait at least 30 minutes for a table even though there where maybe 4-5 tables available on top of having my reservation. I told her that can\u2019t be right because I see empty tables and we came 5 minutes before our reservation. She then proceeded to roll her eyes at me and grabbed our menus without saying anything and tossed them on the table next to her and told us to sit. I then saw her and the other hostess making faces while looking at our table. I have never experienced that kind of treatment before. If she wanted to talk about us she could\u2019ve gone to the back. After our dinner which was okay( the waiter was super respectful) I came up to her and asked her for her name. She looked me in the eyes and said \u201cumm no\u201d and walked away. Overall I will definitely not be coming back. Although the food and waiter were great, coming into an establishment and getting that kind of treatment from a person who\u2019s job it is to make you feel welcome made me never want to come back. There are so many places in the city that are much more professional and I would recommend going ANYWHERE else because receiving this kind of treatment from a place where you are paying for their service is unacceptable.",

He was very cold and didn\u2019t even crack a smile. When we were all seated, he told my group to move in a rude manner because our table was close to the table next to us, even though no one was sitting at the table next to us. We brought up the free birthday margarita that\u2019s advertised online and again, he rudely responds \u201cyou have to give your email and I have to see the link\u201d then left the table. We eventually figured it out without his help and received the free drink because now at this point it\u2019s just principle. The arepa benedict was very bland but on the bright side, the chilaquiles are decent. The place is super cute but unfortunately will never go back thanks to Chris.",

The shared octopus and carnitas plate were good as well but once you have the steak taco you'd have wish you just ordered more instead of the shared plates. FYI, all there tacos are not just plain meat but instead  come with more than your standard toppings which is great.  In short, order the steak tacos, ignore the shared plates.

Outstanding taste profiles and carefully selected ingredients make even the simplest \"Mexican street tacos\" a highly flavorful experience. Details in the menu, drinks and desserts. Enjoyed the Micheladas, make sure you ask for a few sprinkles of Tajin. Ordered a trio of chicken tacos and grilled chicken salad to go. Enough food for two with room to spare. Going to try the flan and ceviche next trip.",

While I was there, there were some extremely rude guests at the table next to us. Not to go into details, but I have to say that the staff handled everything extremely well. They were quick to take action, and were so professional with everything. I was extremely impressed with how they handled it. We also had amazing food and service. Alejandro was our waiter, and he provided us with amazing food recommendations. I would definitely go back here again. They have great food, great outdoor area, awesome atmosphere, AMAZING staff, and they work extremely hard at making sure you enjoy your experience. Also...margaritas...so good! I would suggest the pineapple verde marg!",

At least have it in a actual large glass or bowl). Other than that I always have a nice time. But an extremely over priced margarita in a plastic party cup is not cool.",

The good: Arguably some of the best tacos I\u2019ve had in awhile, and beats overhyped places like Big and Little\u2019s. The crispy fish and coconut shrimp, both on blue corn tortillas, were amazing in their own way. The fish had a tangy and unique sauce paired with it, and the shrimp was paired with a tasty dollops of a honey sauce. Additionally, the esquites were amazing! The corn was roasted well without being overcooked, and it was a great balance between the cheeses and sauces, so nothing was runny. And, I can\u2019t go without saying how great the margs were. Refreshing, strong, and delicious.  The not-so-good: While great, the tacos are a bit pricey. $9-12 (depending on which you get) for 2 tacos, which are on the small side, is a bit much. Also, we were sitting outside, and the train can be a bother (not that that\u2019s something they can change). And, the entire inside smelled like cleaning solution, and it crept outside at times as well.  Food/Drink: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10",

If you have a limited selection drink menu and open bar, maybe pre make the drinks so you can pour out of a carafe instead of making people wait for over 30 minutes at the bar. If it was a different event, I suppose it might have been an okay location. Also, the table area on the platform near the windows. OMG. That iron foot rest in front of the platform has got to go!

The tacos are okay but the menu has lots of rules which is odd, you should be able to have what you ask for if you\u2019re willing to pay. Margaritas were good but very expensive and alot of ice!",

We had a full day downtown in the heat and had just seen Hamilton and we weren\u2019t looking for anything too fancy. This place was perfect! I was able to get a reservation for 8 plus a high chair. When we got there we sat at a higher table with stools, but my niece  wasn\u2019t able to reach the top of the table in her high chair. I asked if they could move us to a shorter table and they did! I very much appreciated them accommodating us. I would have loved to give them 5 stars but I just wasn\u2019t much impressed with the portion sizes for shared plates. The octopus was perfect for our group size, but the ceviche trio (way overpriced for what you get), guac & Chips and rice did not stretch very far. All in all, it\u2019s a great place with great food and definitely worth checking out!",

I ordered the steak taco which was quite good. I liked the purple potato chip that was topped off. I probably would have purchased those chips just as an appetizer if there was the option to.  The restaurant was very modern and great for groups since they had large tables and were able to take multiple credit cards - though they weren't able to split checks which I always prefer.  Service was great, water was always refilled, and the taking of orders was prompt.  I'm only giving this 3 stars because while the food and service was good, I don't think I'd come back on my own. The pricing of the tacos, even during happy hour were $3 for a 2 bite taco. Not the most budget friendly establishment but I can see people coming here for good drinks and food if they don't mind the cost much.",

The chips were average. The French fries was a bit insulting as it was a portion of a potato and such a high price. The dessert was in a tiny shot glass that was flan with caramel.
