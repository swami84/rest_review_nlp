Though we were past the deadline for takeout orders (still COVID season) for that night, the hostess graciously fit us in and accommodated a meal for two. And, when we casually mentioned it was our anniversary at the pickup window, they threw in an extra gift!  We both thought our meal was superb. Service and food was so wonderful that we even discussed making Little Pearl our yearly tradition on our anniversary. Kudos to the team for winning a regular diner!",

The building is well lit, though the door is not easy to locate. The food was fantastic. We had a six course dinner which featured the classics. Everything was well cooked, the portions were well sized given the number of courses, and the cocktails were great. The wait staff was very, very helpful. They recommended great wine, offered information about the food, and were friendly, but didn't dominate. We paid for the two dinners when we made the reservation, so all we paid for were drinks and the tip when we left, which was also nice. I'd go back in a heartbeat!",

For dinner, the food and wine pairings are wonderful, but the space is relatively uncomfortable - almost like you're having an expensive, well-curated dining experience in a coffee shop. Some of the tables are of the metal patio variety and the chairs are comfortable for about 30 minutes before the squirming adjustments set in. The coffee is great, but don't expect to ever really be a regular here as the staff doesn't seem to remember anyone. Therefore, it doesn't feel like a neighborhood spot, but an anonymous special occasion place. With a slight \"vibe\" change, this place could truly be spectacular.",

The small plates for dinner are good and the burger is fun. The cocktails are good too. At less than $50 the tasting menu is a bargain. Very few good restaurants will have a tasting menu priced that low. Let alone a restaurant that is well reviewed in a major US city.  The Cafe (items pictured below) is on the expensive side especially with the up-charge for the nut milks, but the sweet potato donuts is fantastic and the chicken sandwich is up there with the best.  The cache some people expect with Little Pearl now wielding a Michelin star seems to be hurting the restaurants in these reviews. Not all starred restaurants are formal places (there are even street vendors with stars in other parts of the world) and relatively low cost for the quality means that the menu and the service are quite a bit less than its also star struck siblings.",

In fact, if butter is the only flavor, then it really should have earned a few more stars.  The hash brown that begins the meal tastes like a square cube version of a McDonald's hashbrown - it's butter oily flavor overpowers the hollandaise chive sauce that it is dolloped with on top.  The prawns that looked promising with its light batter, also were super oily without hints of any other flavor.  The toast with the honey brie was laden with butter as if the toast was pan fried in one stick of butter until crispness.  The butter in the toast is so overpowering you can hardly taste the delicate flavors of the brie and honey.  The toast of the same degree of butter feel is again repeated in a grilled cheese and tomato soup pairing.  The soup alone is a bit creamy enough to balance the tomato acidity, but nothing to wow over.  For what otherwise is a classic comfort food, it hardly gave that warm and fuzzy feeling.  Also to note: the spoon does not sit still in the small wooden soup bowl. So guests at the table experienced unexpected spillage which can be a bit of an annoyance if you want to take a rest between bites and are unaware of where else to lay your spoon. The pork is presented with a honey mustard sauce, again nothing you haven't tasted before or maybe even better at a barbeque joint.  The mussels came with...wait for it...yes the butter laden toast!  Usually, you look forward to dipping the bread in the mussels broth, however the toast had so much of its own butter it could barely absorb the mussel broth. Also the mussels were presented standing up and offered a great presentation perhaps, but were dry because the broth was beneath, in a sea of its own. The only exciting item which showcased creativity is the faux deviled eggs where the egg white is made of meringue. That was the only night's pause on butter flavor.",

        "caption": "So this is a slightly skewed review as we went for the Truffle dinner they just hosted. I was very underwhelmed. First off, they brought shared plates that were very small they looked like they were for one person but they were for 2. We ordered the vegetarian menu, our friends ordered the regular one.  1st course was sort of truffle croquette with garlic aioli. It was good but I wish it had more sauce.  2nd course was either a beef or beet tartare. It was delicious! But again, the portion size was incredibly small and my friend and I shared one plate. Good thing we were fair and let each person have half.  3rd course Carolina Golden Rice. This was good but something was missing. Great presentation though. I wish it was bigger. Thankfully this was the one dish they separated for each of us to have our own small cup. It was risotto-esque.  4th course was AWFUL! It was the main course too. Friends got duck confit and chicken thigh. They said it was dry and the waitress poured the sauce on just one part so it lost flavor. We were given these trumpet mushrooms with truffles. The mushrooms completely lacked the truffle flavor as it was completely covered in this overly powerful asian sauce of some kind. And for some reason that dish made me incredibly nauseous a few hours later. I just know it was that dish for some reason. I know they were trying to be original but why wouldn't they do a homemade pasta dish with truffles. It would have been so so much better.  5th course was great and very interesting but again, it was so small and I had to share it with my friend. We were good about sharing half with each other but it was tempting not to. It was some sort of chocolate tart and had truffle ice cream on the side. It worked well. Never would have imagined having truffle ice cream in my life.  I know truffles are expensive but for over $100 person I really thought we would have our own plates and slightly larger courses. Very disappointing.  I do think I will plan to go back sometime in the future to try a meal not on truffle night though.",

But they still have a tasting menu! The tasting menu is much simpler than Pineapple and Pearls, but still very creative and enjoyable. They also offer a simpler and less expensive wine pairing, which was enough wine for me. The night I was there, they featured organic wines from Greece that were quite good. The food itself was also very good, and the service was great as well. Some reviewers have complained that they were still hungry after the tasting menu, but I thought it was enough. I don't enjoy a tasting menu where I'm too full to enjoy the end of it. The crowd here is in their twenties, mostly. I think I was the oldest person in there. The ambience is nice, with the restaurant set well back from the street.",

I had called up twice before we went, once to book and once to push the booking back 30 minutes and everything seemed great.  Although about 3 hours before our reservation, I was called up and informed that, although I had booked 2 months early, I was just now being told that it was a special night and therefore it would be double the price - $85/head. I still thought that, as this was the case, it would be well worth it and much more special, so we still went. When we got there, we were placed in a room that was freezing - it was a February evening in DC and it was warmer outside. We then waited for about 20 minutes to get our first course. This tasted excellent (hence 2 stars).  Over the course of the evening, we received 7 more courses of food (read mouthfuls of food).  We went away extremely hungry after our $200 dinner.  I would have certainly expected a lot lot more for that price, I had assumed on the phone that it would include the wine pairing that they advertise, but no such luck.  I could have spent the night in my garden with a packet of chips and been just as full, and a lot warmer. Furthermore, not once during 8 courses were we ever asked how anything was.  Pretty disappointing evening, and I will certainly let people know should they ask.",

The service was poor - it was difficult to get the attention of our waitress, and the dishes were very poorly timed (~25 minutes between some small plates).

The two of us had to keep ordering more food (which brought us to $150+) just to feel moderately satiated.  We were disappointed by the $36 lobster, which is a minuscule portion even with the tiny dumplings that come with it. However, the people who ordered the burger looked happy. So choose wisely.  Nevertheless, I was impressed by the creativity of the menu, the friendly service and the beautiful setting. We had a great night here.",

But, let us turn our attention to the Little Pearl Burger. It's not the burger you need, but the burger you deserve. Served on a freshly baked brioche bun you will find two cuts of beef that are the carnivorous equivalent of sheer, mouthwatering decadence. The beef is so delicious that I can only imagine this cow lived a fanciful life, rife with joy and triumph, only meeting its demise when it was good and ready, all the while surrounded by those that knew it best. This benevolent bovine offered itself as a sacrifice for the survival of others, and I cannot have been more honored to become one with it. I could go so far as to share the joy of the Russian sauce that topped this quixotic quadruped, one so good that it made me question my own democratic processes, but I must encourage you to take the journey for yourself and bask in the glory of this dish.  tl;dr cute place, badass burger. 7/5 would visit again.",

Great coffee, chill vibe, fab pastries/food (shout out to the pineapple & pearl roll and the grilled cheese sandwich, neither of which made the transition to Little Pearl).  I was sad when they closed, but jazzed when I heard they'd be opening a bigger location.  Imagine, a place with the feel and quality of the Pineapple & Pearl Caf\u00e9, but where I could sit, relax, and enjoy time with friends!  What could go wrong?  Everything, evidently.  I visited this past weekend and couldn't have been more disappointed.  Sure, the coffee was still solid, but the pastries were trash--my friend's cinnamon bun was hard as a rock, as if it'd been left sitting out overnight, and my bread pudding was tough and flavorless.  Worse, however, was the atmosphere, which was the #1 thing I was looking for from Little Pearl.  The place was tourist and MOTH central.  Screaming children, parents who treated the entire seating area as their kid's playroom, tourists who spread out and shouted loudly at each other with no regard for the fact that all of us are squeezed together in a cramped, enclosed space.  Can Little Pearl control their clientele?  Perhaps not, but it appeared the place was actually designed to attract such a crowd.  Everything about Little Pearl, from the poorly laid out interior (how you order and pick up coffee is a joke) to the food and the atmosphere was unpleasant, frustrating, and pretty much the antithesis of what I was looking for in my local coffee shop.  I visited the old Pineapple & Pearl Caf\u00e9 at LEAST twice a week...it'll be a miracle if I ever step foot in Little Pearl again.  Starbucks has pretty bad coffee, but honestly the Starbucks down the street has a cooler vibe, better food, and a more relaxing interior (props particularly to the top floor).  Note: I have not been to Little Pearl's nighttime wine bar incarnation, so I cannot speak to that.  It could be a completely different world at night; this review is only for the caf\u00e9.  Two stars are earned by the still-solid Vietnamese coffee, the mini sitting room that is the only thing that saved my sanity (the full seating area was an unmitigated trainwreck), and my fond memories of the greatness that was the Pineapple & Pearl Caf\u00e9 (RIP).  Sadly, it seems the hype generated by the Pineapple and Pearl restaurant has poisoned what could have been a nice local coffee joint.  If you're not a self-important MOTH or a tourist who's going for the Insta, avoid this place like the plague.",

I was devastated when I heard that coffee and pastries would no longer be served at Pineapple & Pearls, as they did an amazing job with both (I LOVED the pistachio rose tea cakes!). However, Little Pearl opened up relatively soon after and became the stylish coffeehouse and wine bar we all craved and wanted.  By day, Little Pearl serves as the place for your caffeine needs. Coffee, espresso drinks, tea, hot chocolate, chai, iced banana latte, coconut nutmeg latte, London Fog, and even affogato.  They also get creative with sandwiches, and you can find a breakfast wrap of eggs, potatoes, and gruyere available until 11:30am or a smoked brisket, fried chicken, eggplant parm, and even a lobster roll here. If you're trying to keep your resolutions and build that summer bod, they have salads too (and I'm talking farro and winter greens with housemade yogurt, not a Caesar salad). Or if you've got a sweet tooth, they have plenty of pastries - sweet potato and turnip tart, cinnamon roll, potato donut, bread pudding, hot churros - and even gelato. I've tried the coconut nutmeg latte and the eggplant parm and they're both divine.  At night, Little Pearl dons its 21+ menu of cocktails and wine. There aren't a ton of selections, but you'll probably find something you like given their tastes.  You can make reservations online for the evenings, but they do keep half their dining room tables available for walk-ins. Otherwise during the day, it's first come, first serve. Great place for a cup of Joe, lunchtime plans with friends, or a fun date in the evening!",

        "caption": "Little Pearl isn't so tiny in heart. When Aaron Silverman of Rose's Luxury and Pineapple and Pearl fame announced he was opening a coffee shop on Capitol Hill, a few things were stacked up against him: 1) He was taking over the space of a beloved Hill restaurant, Bayou, 2) The space is a historic building coming with limitations on design and function, 3) It's off of Barracks Row on the property of a community center with low traffic, and 4) One can argue the DC coffee scene is saturated. Well, Aaron and his team are fighters and Little Pearl overcame every obstacle to create a world-class coffee shop/wine bar. Here's why it's THE place to visit near Barracks Row:  1) Quality coffee and food: For a coffee shop, they have a large and diverse menu from the coffee shop regulars like a latte and a mocha. Then they have a few stand out items like pretzel gelato or caffeinated cocktails. In addition, they have sandwiches that are a full menu and if you're in search for the BEST FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH IN THE DMV AREA, look no further. It's on its way to win awards!  2) The price: Little Pearl is classy. There's no questioning it. Because of that, you'd assume prices would be steep, but they are not. My decently sized latte was only $4 (a bit more with the preset 18% tip their checkout system added to it- you can change, but don't. They deserve a 50% tip). Maketto down the road on H Street NE charges much more than that for a latte and it's on par to this one (okay, Little Pearl's is better).  3) The atmosphere: It's in a historic cottage house with a Charleston design and charm. The brick flooring is something they couldn't change being a historic building, but it works with their brick white washed walls and marble bars. It's simple, yet regal. Even the two condiment areas are simple and classy. There's one side room with tables and one back glass enclosed patio area. When it's warm, they have plenty of outdoor seating.  4) The staff: With quality food and a name like Aaron Silverman behind it, Little Pearl has every right to own their success and be arrogant, but they are not. Each staff member is helpful, warm, and concerned for each customer. I met Casey, who I assume if the lead manager, and she is a great person.  5) The personality: When you least expect it, they mold a bit of humor into their brand. If you use the bathroom closest to the bar area, you'll see a Andy Warhol inspired painting of bananas on the wall. It works with the simple design inside the bathroom and it's not cheesy at all. It's subtly hilarious and it works.  When you step inside and experience Little Pearl for a minute, you can't help but give them a standing ovation for overcoming the obstacles, winning the hearts of Capitol Hill, and doing it with such grace and class. Little Pearl, you are a neighbor welcome to stay...forever. I raise my latte to that.",
