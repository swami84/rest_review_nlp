We had dined here the other night, as my wife had purchased a groupon for our up-coming anniversary, but then we learned that DC was making drastic changes to dining in, due to covid, so we rushed in.  The inside was warm and inviting - tables were set apart and wait staff stayed well away, while wearing masks and gloves the entire time. The focaccia was served in individually wrapped portions, and was tasty, full of texture and a perfect accompaniment to our meal!  We both had the scallops and mushroom appetizer, which I thought was delightful, especially as I had never before seen such a pairing. Coupled with just a few pieces of gnocchi to give it some substance, I thought it was perfect.  I had the rigatoni for my main dish and it was perfect - if I closed my eye, I could have been in Tuscany! My wife had the veal milanese (a more northern italian dish - akin to german weiner schnitzel) and really enjoyed it, complaining that they had given her too much food!  For dessert, I had the house specialty, cheesecake, which was crusted with nuts and very tasty, yet unlike any other cheesecake I've ever had. My wife had the semifreddo and raved about the wonderfully delicate layers of strawberry goodness the entire ride home.  I almost forgot to mention, our waiter has worked at THIS SAME restaurant for 14 years. Suffice it to say, he knew the menu and his recommendations were spot-on! ALSO, this was the best (maybe the only?) place that we have been and not treated like second class citizens for using a groupon!!  If you like great Italian food - this is your place! We'll certainly be back!!",

There was a line of people out the door waiting to give their name to the hostess. It was cold so we crammed in line, essentially creating a fire hazard situation as people trying to exit had no room to pass. The line was not moving. About 5 minutes after we got there, a hostess with a clipboard came by to take our name. She told us we should go to the bar as \"this is going to take a while.\" It would have been nice to be offered a complimentary drink at this point seeing that some overbooking mistake had been made. No such offer was forthcoming.  I got a basic gin and tonic at the bar. As my girlfriend and I were waiting, we noticed about 4 empty tables which remained empty over the next 30 minutes while we waited. Another strange observation was that not a single person seated had a plate of food in front of them. Just as I was about to call it quits and find another spot for dinner, the hostess came by to get us to our table. We went but not before I paid $17 for my drink. It's a fairly decent restaurant in DC so I expect to pay a lot for a cocktail, but when I got to my table and looked at the menu I noticed that all of their cocktails are $14. Not sure why I paid more for a gin and tonic...  Earlier in the night we saw someone carrying several coats, but we were never offered any coat service. Our table was crammed and my chair seemed to be jutting out too far into the walkway and in the way of the wait staff. Our waiter was nice but service was slow. We ordered the marinated colossal shrimp as one of our entrees. Let's just say that they should mention that this dish is composed of only 3 shrimp and 4 slices of grilled pepper and onion. For $36, this was a disappointingly paltry amount of food. The chicken we ordered by contrast was a solid (but dry) half chicken that we couldn't put a dent in. The highlights of dinner were the bread basket, the caprese salad, wild mushroom appetizer and home made spaghetti.  The night was unfortunately only memorable for its odd highlights.",

There was no personal introduction or explanation of the menu as there has been in the past, or as you would expect at a nicer restaurant. He also never came by to do the basic inquiry into how our food came out. The portions were a lot smaller than in the past and the side of potatoes that came with my swordfish tasted and looked like they were \u201cinstant\u201d mashed potatoes from a packet.

But even though the dishes were quite good, I Ricchi had a certain special Italian atmosphere in the 90s and early 2000s. And that was just what was missing: there was no Italian around. The girl who received us was African-American, and tried to make us sit at the bar when we had a reservation for dinner. We had arrived 5 minutes early, and the restaurant was almost empty \u2014 tables were off the hook. Then our maid was Filipino and the one who cleared was Hispano. Well, people are what they are, but they couldn't even pronounce the names of the dishes. Then she insisted on describing (if not reading) all the dishes on the list. We know very well how to read, and then we know Italian cuisine. I must also say that to see the Caprese salad with \"balsamic reduction\" on the menu, I immediately realized that the kitchen in this restaurant had become Americanized. And yet the Filipina insisted that everything was very authentic. It has become an extra Italian restaurant in Washington that tells me nothing more. Sin.  (Original) Ma cos\u2019\u00e8 successo? Che delusione. Certo che sono passati pi\u00f9 di quindici anni che non ci ho cenato.  Ma anche se  i piatti erano abbastanza buoni, I Ricchi aveva un certo ambiente speciale ed italiano negli anni 90 e nei primi anni 2000.  Ed era proprio quello che mancava: non  c\u2019era nessun italiano in giro. La ragazza che ci ha ricevuti era afro-americana, ed ha cercato di farci sedere al bar quando avevamo la prenotazione per cenare. Eravamo arrivati con 5 minuti di anticipo, ed il ristorante era quasi vuoto\u2014tavoli ce n\u2019eranon a voglia. Poi la nostra cameriera era filippina e quello che ha sparecchiato era hispano. Vabb\u00e8 la gente \u00e8 quella che \u00e8, ma non sapevano neanche pronunciare i nomi dei piatti. Poi lei ha insistito a descrivere (se non leggere) tutti i piatti sulla lista. Sappiamo benissimo leggere, e poi la cucina italiana la conosciamo. Devo anche dire che a vedere l\u2019insalata caprese con \u201cbalsamic reduction\u201d sul menu, ho capito subito che la cucina in questo ristorante si era americanizzata. Eppur la filippina ha insistito che era tutto molto autentico. \u00c8 diventato un ristorante italiano in pi\u00f9 a  Washington che non mi dice pi\u00f9 niente. Peccato.",

The scallops appetizer, squid ink pasta and the strawberry desert were all on point and very flavorful! Service was just as good and the table was cleared after each course. A bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. Food was so good I forgot to take pictures. Definitely a must place for a romantic dinner.",

The calamari was average, not bad, but the orange/red dipping sauce was flavorless and needed heat (peppers). The scallop/gnocchi was better but still not what I'd call delicious. Our pasta course was excellent: a house-made spiral pasta with salmon in a cream sauce that should be placed on the regular menu (it was a daily \"special\") and a mushroom risotto that was splendid. Finally, we ordered a T-bone steak and an 8 oz filet \"Gypsy style.\" I didn't taste the T-bone but my companion said it lacked flavor and was tough. I ate the filet although I could not taste the meat because of the riotous \"Gypsy\" ingredients, but the thing that utterly ruined it for me was a timbale with white truffle. Now, I don't know if it was real truffle shavings or truffle oil (which is a lab-made chemical flavoring, but it overwhelmed the entire dish with that noxious, obrtbearing, truffle-oil flavor. Very disappointing. I heard that some of the desserts were good, but we we're too full.",

To start us off, the server poured olive oil on our bread plates with a small dab of balsamic vinegar in the center, and then gave us a bread basket of strips of an Italian bread, some having a slice of tomato baked on top - delicious. I started with the bruchetta, which was a huge slice of Italian bread cut into thirds: one part topped with cannoli beans, one piled high with small cubes of perfectly ripened tomatoes doused in olive oil and fresh herbs (my favorite), and one topped with whipped ricotta (about twice  as much as could be eaten). The salmon entree turned out to be large chunks of cooked cold salmon atop a bed of greens with random accompanying items including half a hard boiled egg - the serving was not exciting or even spiced noticeably but provided a pleasant lunch. For my dessert, the tiramisu was a tastefully done 3-inch square. My friends enjoyed other dessert options: blueberry panna cota and gelato served with a huge sweet biscuit. We enjoyed the meal but it did not seem particularly Italian and did not inspire any desire to make another visit soon.",

        "caption": "Went for restaurant week with a party of 6 and we were all very excited about the $35 pre fixed meal. We also ordered two $30 bottles of wine to share with the table.  The quality of the food was that of Italian chain restaurants, such as Buca di Beppo or Olive Garden, but you could tell that the food wasn't microwaved as they usually do at these chains. I Ricchi brags at taking pride in authentic Tuscan fare, but as someone who has lived in the Tuscan region it was far from such and ultimately a huge let down. The dishes we ordered were also missing many of the elements the menu stated they would have. For example, my cauliflower farro salad only a 5 grains of farro sprinkled on the top and was completely missing the cauliflower all together. Essentially, food was mediocre, not mind blowing as expected, and I would be reluctant to return to the restaurant even for the bargain pre fixed meal.  On top of this mediocre quality, our server (Said) was incredibly rude, blunt, and pushy. He judged our initial wine choice and pushed us towards more expensive options. He also offered us limoncello shots at the end and we accepted. In typical Italian restaurants (in both the US and in Italy), limoncello, amaretto, or sambuca is often given as a complimentary gift at the end of a meal to thank customers for business.  Upon receiving the bill, we realized that our server GROSSLY overcharged us for these sips of limoncello, and had automatically added a gratuity of 22% onto the bill. We were absolutely stunned but as this was a celebratory dinner, we were reluctant to ruin the mood and paid our bills in silence.  Upon returning to the table with our receipts to sign, our server than said that two of our cards had been declined stating that he \"tried them multiple times but it looks like you're broke.\" We looked at him blankly and then he indicated that he had made a joke. This was incredibly distasteful, rude, and quite awkward.  I will never in my life be seen again in this hell hole of a restaurant and would suggest those who seek a pleasant dining experience to stay away. I would only recommend dining at i Ricchi to those who wish to be berated by their server and served mediocre food at exorbitant prices.",

My hubby's steak was so tender it hardly needed cutting and we were so full we couldn't even fit dessert, but took it back to the room with us for later. It was also awesome! I can't rave enough about I Ricchi!!",

We had the scallops (2, would have liked more but it was an appetizer) which were delicious and very good mussels; then the Milanese (a bit dry) and lamb chops. Very well cooked despite being thick, they were not the skinny kind with bones. We finished with a chocolate meringue dessert with mousse inside, highly recommended. So far they are on Groupon with a very good deal.",

Rude and disrespectful! That's the short version. Long version: I came here with a coupon and we felt that we got treated differently because of that. We got seated at the worst table in the restaurant. A tiny table right at the wall with not enough space to move. After asking they were so nice to give us a new table. So far so good. Then the waiter came. He was very rude and made us feel uncomfortable with the way he talked down to us. I had bought the groupon three course menu for two with wine. First, there are some limitations as to what you can order. Some entrees require an 8$ update and you can only choose between the red or White House wine, which is ok to me. I just would have liked to know that before going. The gypsy style filet was overcooked and nothing special.",

        "caption": "My wife and I had dinner here last week.  I am generally leery of Italian restaurants having grown up in an italian-american household with a large extended family of cooks.  Too often I leave an italian restaurant and know there was little care or life put into the meal that I just consumed.  Not this time.  From the moment we entered the space we were delighted -- welcomed at the door, welcomed at the reservation desk, promptly seated, and welcomed by the server (Jackie) and her apprentice.  And then we got to the pre-dinner cocktail, menu, and wine list.  Much to be pleased with here - a solid array of appetizers, first, and second courses.  There is no need to say much about our specific order except that I did order the meatballs appetizer.  I report this only because I am somewhat of a meatball snob.  The plate was sizeable and the taste was superb.  As was my wife's appetizer and the dinner courses.  Throughout, the service was very nice.  If you are not careful, though, you can blast through cocktails, appetizer, dinner, dessert, and coffee in seventy-five minutes.  That's good if you are heading to a show but not so good for relaxation. Still, there was no sense of being hurried, just attended to.  The restaurant has a lively \"happy hour\" so diners should avoid any of the bar seating unless you enjoy that type of atmosphere as a digestive aid.  All in all, we will return, we will host friends, and we will tell all that we had a splendid time at I Ricchi.",

The bartender, for the life of me I cannot recall his name, was very charming and held a very entertaining conversation with me while I was waiting for my table. He gave me his recommendations and they were on point and delicious. Tia was amazing as well. Her knowledge on the specials and dishes offered I Ricchi was mind blowing. Not even I could remember all of that. Her service was top notch. She is truly a gem. All in all, the staff was excellent, the food was magnificent and I felt welcomed.

One of the few places that offers a free valet service, which is almost harder to find then a downtown parking spot. That definitely takes away a lot of the stress of eating out -- the \"out\" part and the adventures in parking that go along with it lol. If you happen to get there during happy hour, treat yourself to a cocktail (or two) and conversation with the friendliest bartenders around. Also, be on the lookout for the tastiest complementary appetizers delivered by waitstaff or even Ms. Ricchi herself, who by the way is an amazing woman.  After being seated, you're promptly greeted by professional (extra emphasis on professional) waitstaff who are both  knowledgeable about everything on the menu as well as good pairings and display an unparamounted attentiveness and courtiousness to each customer.  Now to the main attraction: the food. It's always superb. I have never been to a more consistent restaurant at giving the highest quality of food and service. Everything is perfectly cooked and seasoned. And the homemade bread... my mouth waters just thinking of it. This last time I had the Bistecca Al'Arrabbiatta  (sp?) medium-rare, and it was the juiciest steak I'd had in a while. Served with grilled mixed vegetables and fried palenta. It was so good that I had to choose between devouring the whole meal and saving half so I could taste it again. Naturally, I saved some lol  (SCALE 1-5) SERVICE: 5 AMBIANCE: 5 PARKING/VALET: 5 FOOD: 5+ LIKELIHOOD TO RETURN: 5",

Indeed, eventually dining with him at the restaurant during the 1990s, what stood out was the hushed atmosphere, excellent food, but mostly the impeccible and unobtrusive wait staff. In fact, when we ate there with a friend two years ago, we were still very much pleased with the food, and with the waiter who was attentive but not hanging over us.  Last night, we decided to try the restaurant again for an early Mothers' Day celebration - just the two of us - for a quiet evening alone. Our waitress was so obtrusive I came away feeling as though an uninvited guest had joined us at the table. It was surprising enough that, when our meals arrived, she insisted on leaning over our plates, describing each item we had ordered (as if we didn't remember), but upon delivering our dessert menus, she insisted on standing there and reading the selections to us! Besides all this, she seemed to be training another waitress (on a Saturday evening?), and the woman, who shadowed her, looked scared.  My beet salad, Bronzino, and the semifreddo (a layered meringue dessert) were delicious. The fish was very hot, juicy, and flavorful. The green beans were cooked perfectly. We were told desserts are house-made, and it showed. My husband ordered the Caprese salad; had issues with the Mixed Grill (the prosciutto made the quail too salty, and the meat had not been cooked properly). He liked the cheesecake, but didn't rave about it. In general, it seemed a very basic menu, with no creative surprises.",

When we ordered food, they wouldn't allow us to make any alterations to the food to accommodate our dietary and health needs. Ended up leaving without any apology. HORRIBLE PLACE.

I had a date night here last night with a Groupon that costed $70 and got all the following for both me and my date each: 1 glass prosecco + 1 glass wine, 1 appetizer/starter, 1 entree and 1 dessert. Incredible deal from Groupon (was a $170 value) + $35 tip = barely over $100 out the door for a very nice three-course meal with wine for two people. The rating breakdown...  Atmosphere: 4/5 Very nice. Warm, calm, and clean with lots of foliage around the windows. Lighting and music were appropriate.  Service: 4/5 The hostess was a little cold/dry and the bartender (before being seated at our table) was very rigid and formal. I understand the atmosphere/caliber of the place but seeing as me and my date are young and vibrant compared to most of the clientele that was there at the time, you'd think the bartender would be a little more lively to us. The waitress we had, however, was very pleasant and thoroughly knowledgeable about what was on the menu. Constant attention when needed without being overbearing. A fantastic service experience...also, those bussers were very punctual and on point for the wait staff.  Food: 5/5 A fully Tuscan menu with a good range of options to choose from. Waitress was very knowledgeable and was able to provide answers to questions as well as her opinion on the dishes themselves.  Everything was delicious and wonderfully prepared. The presentation was solid, but the flavor just exploded in every dish. I got the special appetizer, the house-cured salmon with baby greens (GET THIS if they have it...some of the best salmon I've ever had), the entree Grigliata Mista della Casa (Mixed grill of marinated pork loin, rabbit sausage, lamb chop, and stuffed baby quail)...out of this world. She got the mixed mushrooms (very rich and savory) and the filet (incredibly tender and flavorful). The dessert was good too, the walnut encrusted mascarpone cheesecake...nutty and delicate, with a lighter texture than average cheesecake.  Price/value: 4/5 Without the Groupon, the total cost would have been double what it was...in which case it's quite expensive. The quality of food and service, however, I would say make up for it on it's own. WITH the Groupon, though? Truly worth every penny.  Overall: 5/5 Highly recommended! The food alone is stellar enough to merit a 5...",

Here is what I found:  the service was excellent - our waiter was well informed about the menu items and made helpful suggestions.  He was attentive without being pushy.  All (!) items on the menu were available to us, including the higher-priced items, so we ended up with a huge discount.  I found the quality of the food to be superb and the portion sizes huge, particularly the appetizers.  The desert was to die for, which was a great way top of a wonderful dining experience.  I would definitely come here again, though I must say that the prices are quite high, particularly for someone from the middle of the country.  If you can expense it, more power to you.",

The food was good, in general, however they did not cook my mother's steak as ordered. That can be forgiven. When the entr\u00e9e I ordered was not to my liking they replaced it. It was the service I'd come to expect from them. However, then an unfortunate event happened. Our waitress and the ma\u00ee\u00b7tre d'h\u00f4\u00b7tel had an altercation. Not a fight, but a tense moment in my view. I could hear the ma\u00ee\u00b7tre d'h\u00f4\u00b7tel discipline the waitress and telling her leave, to go home. The waitress seemed bothered, but kept her composure. She came over to tell us she was going to hand us over to another waiter, which was polite. We decided to tip her for her amazing service. Very angrily the ma\u00ee\u00b7tre d'h\u00f4\u00b7tel rushed over and asked the waitress why she was still there. The span of time between then altercation and there exchange was short and the waitress was only being polite so we would not be caught off guard when a new waiter showed up. The ma\u00ee\u00b7tre d'h\u00f4\u00b7tel's behavior was unprofessional in general for management, but completely unacceptable to display in the front of customers. We insisted that we would tip the waitress, it seemed the ma\u00ee\u00b7tre d'h\u00f4\u00b7tel was annoyed at that. After than exchange the evening went down hill. They replaced my mother's steak, but it was still not correct. They replaced mine, and it was delicious, but by then we just wanted to leave. We asked for the meal to be packed up and we left.",

I checked into my hotel (the St. Gregory) a bit late and was hungry for dinner. I didn't want to stray too far as I was monitoring my car in a metered spot. So, I ambled around the block and mentally turned down a few of the other cuisines and restaurants I passed on the way, deciding that I was really in the mood for Italian. As I mentioned, it was late, so I needed to pick something fairly quick and saw i Ricchi. The atmosphere looked nice and fairly understated, it was Tuscan Italian....Perfect for what I was looking for that night, but I wanted a top DC restaurant calibre meal as well since I was back in town! I COULD NOT believe the absolutely exorbitant and overblown prices. When I remembered \"Hey, I'm in DC, so it's more expensive and maybe they are reflecting the incredible meal I am about to eat\" I decided to stay and treat myself. WHAT A MISTAKE! The food was TERRIBLE! They had a \"master\" guest chef in from Tuscany and I think that she needs to go back to the drawing board and start with the basics again. The food was bland, skimpily portioned and boring. The noodles were completely overcooked and mushy (you are an ITALIAN restaurant--definitely need to get the noodles correct at a minimum). The fish was unseasoned and tasteless. I thought perhaps dessert would redeem itself, but even the Tiramisu was dry and had zero flavor. I was ASTOUNDED at my bill. I had one appertif, an appetizer, entree, glass of wine and dessert and it was over $100 just for me. I would never, ever eat here again and I do not recommend that any one else do either. YUCK! I want my money and the 45 minutes from my life back. (I was also completely rushed through my meal, though they didn't close for over an hour later)... How can a business like this stay competitive in that market where there are sooo many amazing dining establishments? Next time, I might even stick to the hotel dining options or get room service if venturing out meant this poor experience!",
