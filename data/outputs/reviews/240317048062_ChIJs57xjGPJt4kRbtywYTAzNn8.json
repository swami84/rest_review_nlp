Like, The Goyza (Japanese Dumpling) is on the menu as fried or Steamed and Morgan suggested Pan Seared and it was a Home Run. Also, check out the \"Fresh Wasabi\" (A Must).  We always get the Fried Rice as an entree, as the portion is large and quite good and supports all of our Sushi selections. Same goes for the Tator Tots. The starter is topped with Pork belly, Scallions, Spicy Mayo and Bonito Flakes. The dish was delicious and quite filling.  You may want to have some cash on-hand, as the all tips placed on your credit card goes to the house and the servers see a % far less than what you anticipated.  You will definitely enjoy your dining experience.  RichandJames Peterson",

The temperature flakes were  stale and looks like the leftovers  you got from frying shrimp tempura instead of making the batter and frying it solely to make tempura flakes. These were probably fried a few days ago or improperly stored to remove air/moisture from the product.  The baked Cali was overly fishy and a bit on the dry side considering the description has Kewpie mayo. Rice was a bit on the dry side. Just a bad experience. Will not be returning.",

When we received our drinks one glass had lipstick on it from the last guest. Well finally it's time to eat and while the selection was nice, the flavor was simply nonexistent. The sushi looked beautiful and creative but just simply had no flavor.

The event itself was fun, but since I had come so far out of my way I had wanted to order sushi or some sort of small plates before going home. I went to the hostess and explained I wanted to order food and asked if I could be seated, the hostess waved me away saying, \u201cyou can order at the bar.\u201d I proceeded to stand at the bar for about 20 minutes and though multiple people passed by me and looked at me, not one person acknowledged me,  even when I was attempting to flag someone down. I finally gave up and left because apparently no one wanted to accept my money.

Service was good though they were busy, the servers never stopped moving and grabbing orders and helping customers. The restaurant was very pretty and had good ambiance.  The table across from mine ordered several plates of sushi, and the waitress let them know she had charged it as a platter, since they ordered all of the same things that came on a platter. I thought it was very thoughtful of her to go out of her way to help a couple and their mothers on mother's day even though it was so busy. I was very impressed.

You have to ask them to bring it a bit stronger. I have not tried their other drinks. They have a separate poke menu that allows you to create your own poke Bowl which I highly recommend. I have tried almost every item on the menu and I have never been disappointed. the food is made very tasty  and authentic. I come here often and I have brought many different friends and everyone has loved it here. The food is fantastic and the service is Pleasant. I highly recommend this place if you are up for some tasty food.",

However, the quality of the fish was abysmal. Every piece was chewy, making trying to take just a bite impossible. Two rolls we ordered had spicy tuna, which was essentially tasteless. Much like the sashimi, the fish in the salmon rolls was chewy. The only good item in our meal was the pickled ginger. We ordered for four, but were only given two pairs of chopsticks. The rolls were small, coming with 6 pieces as opposed to the standard 8. When ordering online, we were not given all of the options for items listed in the menu itself. Here's to hoping we don't get food poisoning.",

The spicy tuna was no flavor and minimal spice, the seaweed was chewy, and the sushi fell apart while eating it. I\u2019m absolutely baffled as to how this restaurant has so many positive reviews.

We got a sushi boat that included nigiri, sashimi, and 3 rolls of our choice. I liked that we had some say in what kind of rolls we wanted as in other restaurants you usually just have to trust in the chef\u2019s choice! The boat was beautifully presented and the service was amazing and friendly, however I do feel that they put way too much rice in the nigiri. My fianc\u00e9 and I have traveled in japan for a total of 2 months and are avid sushi eaters so we may just be a bit picky but some of the fish did not taste super fresh (not atypical at all for the area though so I\u2019m not really holding it against them). My sister got the seafood udon which was the most decked out seafood udon I have ever seen. Very generous with the amount of seafood!",

I initially came here with some friends for one of their Mochi events that I saw a Facebook event for. Even though I'm allergic to this stuff (dairy), I still came. The mochi that was being distributed around looked sooo good. I wanted to try a piece but I would have had to go to the hospital lol. They were the perfect iced and smooth texture. I could see from my friend's faces that they were enjoying every single bite.  While I was there, I ordered one of their ramen. It came out super fast and was quite filling for me. It came with pork, seaweed, egg, and I think bamboo shoots (not really sure what they were ). Needless to say, it exceeded my expectations. Because it came out so fast, I thought they might have half-assed my meal. But nope, it was cooked and prepared just right. It was hot with a salty flavor and a somewhat thick texture to it. I love eggs in ramen and this was no different.  The restaurant is also very modern to the younger generation while being very inclusive to an older crowd. They play a combination of chill, energetic, and hip music in the background. Which makes me feel great eating there. The workers also seem to have a good time.  Splendid food, service, workers, and atmosphere. I will definitely be back.",

Prices are reasonable and staff was super friendly and accommodating.

My parents and I ordered items from the regular dinner menu as well as items off the Naka Zima Specials menu and Happy Hour food and drink specials. If you love raw fish and/or a spicy touch, you'd probably think Hanaro got one of the best happy hours in town.  For dinner, we ordered the following: Seaweed Salad, Lava Roll, Yellowtail and Scallion Roll, Spider Roll, California Roll, and a 18 piece sashimi.  The Lava Roll consisted of crabmeat maki topped with chopped sashimi (e.g., scallop, smoked salmon, white tuna, shrimp, and avocado) and baked in Japanese mayonnaise. It was served with crispy tempura fritters and two types of spicy sauce (e.g., spicy mayo, Sriracha). Despite asking for the spicy stuff on the side, it was much hotter than what I have ordered at New Tokyo.  The Yellowtail and Scallion Roll consisted of six yellowtail rolls topped with thinly chopped scallion.  The Spider Roll consisted of soft shell crab tempura, avocado, and cucumber rolls topped with masago and eel sauce.  By the time we finished the rolls, it was time for the complimentary sake tasting. We got to try 7 different kinds of sake. My favorites included Dassai that was served at 2016 States Dinner, Kikusui Funaguchi Honjozo, Ikezo Peach Sparkling Jelly Sake, and Yuzu Lilly Yuzu Tini (a blend of Yuzu (citrus flavored) liqueur and shoju).  After the sake tasting, we enjoyed our 18 piece sashimi which consisted of chef's selection of fresh raw fish including octopus, white fish, white tuna, salmon, red tuna, and yellowtail.  I plan on returning to Hanaro Restaurant in the near future!",
