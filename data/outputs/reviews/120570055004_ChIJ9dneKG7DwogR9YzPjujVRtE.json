You honestly can have better food at less than half the price at any other Caribbean restaurant. Because of the price, I had high hopes for the food. The Mac and cheese was not flavorful at all. I would not order that again but the Caribbean chicken platter was good. Very good quality chicken! The tables were very nice but man is it cold inside. Bring a jacket! There is also live music that can be a little loud and distracting sometimes. It's kind of cramped inside too. Overall it's a nice place that I will recommend. Just be prepared to spend some money cause it is expensive. I would go again but only if it was a special event.",

The service was way better than I expected even when you compare the service to well known chains.  However, as a note, if you\u2019ve never had Caribbean food before AND are not a fan of flavor (aka spices), this is not for you. The food had so much flavor and finally a place that can make really good jerk chicken.  Honestly hands down one of the most underrated places in the area.

The service received was even better than what we have received from a cruise ship. They bent over backwards to make sure we had everything we needed or wanted.  The food....THE FOOD!! So much flavor!!! WOW!!!! Not an exaggeration to say this was the best cornbread, salmon, chicken curry, brown stew, mac and cheese, pasta, and cornbread we have ever had!

My daughter had eaten before we arrived and promised to be good as Long as she got ice cream. So when the waiter came I ordered all of the food and a cup of ice cream for my daughter. I ordered the taste of the islands which was supposed to be a plate of curry goat, Some oxtail and jerk chicken. Before our food arrived we had to ask multiple people for the ice cream which eventually came after our drinks and appetizers. When the food arrived we realized that I had gotten the wrong dish. It was a sampler of different carribean meat dishes, but they were all chicken. either way the food tasted good and my daughter ended up getting the ice cream eventually. I was still charged for the more expensive meat dish but it was only about 4 dollars more expensive so I didn\u2019t complain. My aunts ordered the snapper which tasted amazing as well but they had to dig around all the bones, of which there were plenty. All in all great flavor but there was room for improvement.",

In fact, we were so pleased with everything that we said a little prayer that they stay in business for a long time and get the chance to expand!!! Now, we chose it from a selection of places for my girlfriend\u2019s bachelorette dinner especially after seeing the decor of the place! It\u2019s a beautiful black owned restaurant with amazing service! The owners who are husband and wife were so kind and made us feel welcomed and at home. The ambience was perfect for a nice classy dinner with friends or a romantic dinner for two. Secondly, the food - Oh MY Gash!!! The jerk chicken, ox tails and curry chicken were delicious and seasoned to perfection. Note; if you like spicy jerk, this is is the place to be. True to the word of the owner, the meat fell off the bones! The specially made shots were delicious and tropical! Though it may seem pricey at first, I promise that it is worth it!! I think for me, the service was the best part of this experience! They were efficient and timely and everyone  was so polite! Janise and Andre are superb! This place is a must whenever you\u2019re in Tampa!",

From the moment we walked in we were greeted by what has to be the single most professional and thorough server I have ever encountered. The man (Andre) shook my hand as I entered the door. Things like that are too often overlooked and forgotten in today's day and age. Everything, including the adult beverage I had, was stellar. The chef is a freaking rockstar. A true artist. Nothing left the kitchen that wasnt 5 stars worthy. Amazing experience. They even had dedicated tables for date nights and anniversaries. Keep up the great work!",

It was such a candlelit mood, but there is space for a bar to watch the game if you so please. Reservations could certainly help because shortly after I arrived as a party of one more patrons arrived and the small venue filled quickly. There was a bit of a wait, but their menu online and most importantly their host informed me that they were running behind and that they would be euth me shortly. They also cook their food fresh with organic ingredients. You could tell the difference immediately. Once my food arrived I wasnt concerned with the wait. The jerk chicken was so tender and juicy I could slice through it with a fork. The curry goat was savory and the oxtail was tasty. I enjoyed their selection of beverages that ranged from organic kombucha and water to hot tea or soda. I should have taken pictures. I would recommend. Just be aware of the initial wait time....abt 15 minutes depending on when you arrive and staffing.",

They even wear gloves to keep everything clean. The food was HEAVENLY!! Everything is very fresh. I had salmon with a sweet potato and side salad. For a starter we ordered roti and coconut bread. For dessert I had rum cake. The food portions were very satisfying. The restaurant itself is very clean looking with white table clothes, white booths. But it also has a cozy feeling with floral arrangements and affirmations written in wood on the tables. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant!!",

What a nice place to eat. Not often you find a Caribbean restaurant that is not a hole in the wall place but this is very nice. I sat at the bar and chatted with the owners who are great hosts. My jerk chicken was nice but it was hot. If you have sinus problems you will be cured. I will definitely be back.",

The bread pudding and rum raisin ice cream will blow you away. I simply cannot say enough about this gem of a restaurant. Our server was Alexis and she was superb. Very attentive and pleasant.

The jerk and stew chicken is great too, portions are generous. It\u2019s not a cheap place but it is in the heart of south Tampa so.... we all know how that goes.

There is one chef who prepares every plate in the house. Having spent years in the service industry I'd like to give \"big ups\" to the chef for pushing out such impressive volume and maintaining the quality of each and every plate and the staff for staying cool and calm during a push.  They treat you like family. We have tried the chicken platter, oxtails, jerk and curry chicken, and their stew chicken is really incredible. Great atmosphere, well decorated. They serve full natural coconuts too so that's awesome! Theres no liquor license here so dont expect drinks to kick your butt but they are delicious and fun recipies. They do need a better POS solution though as check processing can take a while due to lack of machines.",

We had to put in our order days in advance and my husband was not able to get the goat he had ordered cause they didnt have it ready in time. But we still paid for the goat. Confusion in our party with what was ordered. My son ordered a Ting and he said it was very watered down. The water tastes like they have no proper water filter. Prices online is not the prices in the restaurant. Be aware If you have a party of more than 6 even if the checks are separate they automatically charge 20%gratuity on each check. Stew chicken was also very greasy. By the way our family is Jamaican so I know what I am talking about. Service was bad also, our table was gonna get charged twice they had no clue who had what, 3 servers attending us and they could not keep track of everything, it was a mess.",

Upon entering, I was taken aback by the decor, it was new, super clean, modern, and had TV's playing all kinds of sports (Rugby, Cricket, Basketball, etc).  I immediately thought 'There is no way they have a high chair'... Well after we were immediately greeted and seated (by who I later found out were the owners) they brought out the best high chair I have seen at a restaurant!  It matched the decor, had adjustable straps, and a removable tray/top.  We ordered drinks (both great) and chips with mango salsa.  When the salsa arrived they also brought out apples and grapes in an Elmo cup for our son!  I watched them bring out something similar for another couple with a kid. The entree's we ordered were fantastic (I have never had fall off the bone tender chicken that was this good before!... and in three different flavors!), plenty of food, too much in fact that I didn't finish or leave room for dessert.  I can't recommend this place enough, sincere staff/owners, fantastic decor, super clean, great for couples, and family's with small children, and downright amazing food.",

Can\u2019t believe this place isn\u2019t packed on a Saturday night!  It\u2019s small and cozy, formal look with a casual feel. Very friendly staff really goes out of their way to make you feel appreciated. When another server noticed me low on a drink she stopped to ask. Very cool!  As for the food, unique and delicious!  My wife had the brown stewed chicken, to die for!  There were some potatoes spread sparingly throughout the stew and oh ma goodness!  Good stuff!  I had the oxtail/jerk chicken/curry goat entree and every bit of it was excellent. The curry sauce was thick and flavorful, the oxtail was a bit fatty but you could tell it\u2019d been cooked so slowly that it was almost becoming part of the sauce it was served in. No problems munching that stuff right along with the meat attached!  It\u2019s that good!  As for the jerk chicken...  yup, it hot.  Not irritatingly hot, just a good kick in the tongue. If you don\u2019t like heat, I would share this with someone else. As for me, loved it. Hard to explain it. Not juicy but not dry. It\u2019s just jerk chicken. Exactly the way it\u2019s supposed to be IMO.  One last thing to say about the place, it is well managed. Not sure if our server may have been part of the ownership or not, but he was very professional. There was a slight hiccup in our order, an appetizer simply failed to come out but he noticed the mistake, turned it right on its head and brought it out with dinner free of charge. This is just the restaurant guy in me coming out but I do have to applaud the commitment to customer experience. No empty apology, no excuse. Although we declined politely, (and we didn\u2019t mind a bit, really!) he insisted. Bravo folks!  A simple one on a million mistake turned into something that makes a happy customer brag on you!  That\u2019s it for anyone wanting a review, as for the end of my little thing here, I just wanted to say hats off to the Yah Mon staff. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening and talked about how much we loved it all the way home. You all deserve a quick mention, not from google but right from the Sloan family. We wish you continued success and will visit each and every tine we are in Tampa. We\u2019ll be relaying our experience to our family and friends!  Thank you for a wonderful meal!",

For the lovers of Caribbean cuisine, Yah Mon represents everything you wish could be found at most of other Jamaican restaurants...great food, nice decor, and chill atmosphere.  In terms of the food, I usually opt for the jerk wings (best damn wings ever), stew chicken, or stew snapper.  The rice and beans are cooked perfectly.  The salad is super fresh and crisp.  Everything I've tasted at the restaurant has been OMG good (yes, really that good LOL)  The prices are commensurate with the portion and quality of the food so don't get sticker shock because they are different than what you'd pay at the little local Jamaican restaurant (IMO which should be expected at a beautifully decorated dine-in restaurant with amazing food)  The restaurant is run by an awesome, hard working couple.  Definitely check it out!  I highly recommend it for a date or even just for a nice dining experience.  Please keep in mind they are only open for dinner and the hours are fairly limited.",

The ambiance of the place is so relaxed from the comfortable booths, to the nice Caribbean music playing softly in the background. The servers are really nice and they aim to please. The owner came over to our table and offered us a free glass of wine for no apparent reason.  The food matched the environment!!! Everything was hot and fresh and so delicious. The food taste like true authentic Jamaican food. The Taste of the Islands dish is my go to selection.  The only complaint I have is that they were out of Jamaican patties so I didn't get to taste one. Other than that, this place gets 5 stars from me and I will most certainly visit again, and again.... and again!",

The food is authentic since the owners and chef are from the Caribbean. Can't say anymore about this place. Definitely my spot for when I come back. I recommend everything but try the \"Taste of the island\" dish. You get everything in one. OMG. The owners were also very attentive and pleasant. Did I mention I can't say enough of this place?

The chef, is Andre's wife from the VI. He is from Jamaican decent as well. The decor is modern, classy and romantic. I love that they accommodate any special occasion by adding personal touches to ensure a magical experience.  Food is top notch. Try the curry or brown stew chicken. The ending to it all was a trip to the islands with a bite of their homemade coconut cake. Absolutely worth every penny.",

The menu had several apps and entrees for my veggie friends so I made the reservation. I really did not know what to expect of \"upscale Caribbean\" dining. When I think of Jamaica,  I think of tiki and beach ... you know casual mon. But Yah Mon is very nice inside: nice interior, decoration, white linen, candles and servers in semi-formal black. The host and co-owner Andre was one of those real people that you will wish every restaurant had as the host. He was friendly, courteous, helpful, and obviously passionate about what he is creating. (Hint: his wife is from USVI but he comes from a large US city ;) ) He was genuinely concerned that our family had an excellent evening and we did. We started with a few apps, the veggie turnover and jerk chicken wings. Both were very tasty. Andre told us the wings were spicy and he is not kidding. We then had an assortment of entrees: mac and cheese, curry chicken, brown stew chicken, veggie tofu plate.  All of them had great presentation, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and tasted great. A lot of \"yum\" sounds and no complaints. It is indeed upscale Caribbean dining. We enjoyed the entire evening. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a unique and interesting place to try, or for a couple who wants a romantic evening.  Go, try it once.",

The food is just hands down the BEST IN TOWN I've had in my 11 years in Tampa, Fl. The food is fresh and seasoned oh so well (yummy). I will most definitely be going back for more of this amazing food.. Thanks for giving us the Royal Treatment Guys...",

I got the chicken platter, just so I could try more than one thing. The star was the brown chicken stew. SO GOOD. And yes, the jerk chicken is spicy if you eat the skin. However, the skin easily came off in one piece and left nicely seasoned meat below.  Husband got the goat curry. He said it was good, just not great in comparison to my brown chicken stew.  The pineapple juice wasn't fresh, just fyi.",

The food presentation and environment were great and only surpassed by the taste of the dishes. The Jerk chicken was the best I've ever had as it was the only time the chicken was seasoned and moist. I had the Chicken Sampler which included the Jerk chicken and 2 stewed moist/tender offerings (1 curry, 1 dark roux). I also had coconut cake as my desert. Moist and more perfect than I could have anticipated.  The only advice I'd give is wear a jacket as it was a bit chilly sitting under the fan. I can't wait to get back and try their seafood",
