So I picked an egg salad sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. For such a simple sandwich, the flavors were mild but not bland, and the speed of the service was impressive, especially since we arrived during rush hour. I eyed my coworkers corned beef sandwiches throughout the meal. There were A LOT of meat in between those slices of bread! The presentation of the meal was good too. Definitely will come back when I'm in the area.",

I asked for mayo on my friend's tuna sandwich but somehow in the staff person's scurrying there was no mayo. Of course this was only discovered after my return to the office. I really felt bad for the staff to have to continue serving people with so little resources. I hold management responsible for not stocking  their shelves. adequately. 1:30 is still too early to run out of key ingredients. Warning... don't come after 1:00 pm.",

The turkey was fantastic, and is enough for me to have for two days if I can control myself. I also tried the roast beef, which was very tender. I was going to order ham, changed my mind when I saw how good the roast beef looked (because they carve it right in front of you) and forgot what I ordered. I was pleasantly surprised that I got roast beef, and glad that I tried it.  After some time has passed after my thanksgiving turkey, I will be back for more turkey!
