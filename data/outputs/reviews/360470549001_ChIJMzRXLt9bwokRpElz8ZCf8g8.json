This New American place has some nice choices on the menu but the most eye catching has to be the fried chicken simply because it sounds substantial. 7 pieces of chicken and each seasoned amazingly well that I nearly forgot to dip it in the honey or even put on the spicy sauce right next to it. While 7 may sound a lot, make no mistake this is not a plate you'd want to share.  Another honorable mention is the appetizer of a potato and basil ... Soup? Either way, the seasoning is wonderful and I'd like to ask for seconds for sure.  The campfire old fashioned was good but what do you do with the actual chocolate, Graham cracker and roasted marshmallow? Do I leave it for later? Do I have it immediately? Am I supposed to be immersing that into the drink as it was placed on a toothpick above the drink?  The staff was attentive for sure and the lighting was intimate. Really great job with that.  So why the missing star? Simply put, it's pretty pricey for the portions it provides. It's a cute restaurant but for some reason I just can't justify the price to portion ratio. Remember those dishes I mentioned earlier?  I shared them with my girlfriend and with the 2 drinks together it came out to over $80 and we were still hungry.  We ended up going to a second restaurant after that.",

While awaiting our reservation time, we stopped at this small cafe called Loosie's nearby at 6th Street under the Williamsburg Bridge.  This is a small, eclectic and hip place with interesting indoor and outdoor seating. We stopped for coffee drinks, finding them decent. Espresso was citrusy and rather bitter, better for milk coffee drinks than taken on its own. The Cortado, for more or less the same reason, tasted better.  Not really a place for great coffees, it must be said that Loosie's was a relaxing place to get off our feet and have a rest. Free wifi with a strong signal helped pass the time during our coffee break here.",

Everything was impeccably cooked from a technical perspective but most of it didn\u2019t have the flavor I\u2019d hope for.  The cornbread may be the worst offender. You can tell that care and thought went into its preparation. They even tossed it on the griddle to sear one side. But the bread had zero flavor to it. I wanted so much more.  Same for the biscuits and eggs. The chicken and waffles maybe hit it the best on the flavor with an interesting spicy and sweet fruit syrup and the chicken was perfectly cooked but it could have used more flavor.  Overall I wanted it to be great. And they\u2019re clearly putting a lot of love and effort into it but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be going back.",

Bright, colorful, and design-minded decor pairs wonderfully with delectable nutella beignets (with homemade whipped cream) and some of the best fried chicken and waffles I've ever tasted. The manager was also very thoughtful and apologetic as our order ticket was misplaced, yet we hadn't even felt like we had been waiting too long when she came over and apologized and comped some of our ticket.",
