        "caption": "I was sad to see Cafe Vienna go, but those feelings were quickly assuaged with the hospitality and quality that the new owners of this baked goods and breakfast stop demonstrated.  IMO the best place in Lincoln Park for a great, casual breakfast! I\u2019ve all the confidence that the hostess, Susan, and the Dolce team will continue Vienna\u2019s legacy of cafe excellence.  10/10, absolutely recommend",
