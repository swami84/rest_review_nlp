        "caption": "Based on the mixed reviews and my own intuition, I thought I should avoid this place, and I wish I'd listened to my gut. It looks like it should be good. It's a quaint cafe under a Dupont Circle rowhouse. It's got cool photos on the walls. The menu looks good. But it's not good, not at all.  I ordered a meatball sandwich and wine, and got three meatballs on a plate with a stale piece of garlic bread. I thought it was possible I mis-ordered so I just ate it, but thought it'd be weird to have just three meatballs on a plate as an entree, no pasta or anything. And they weren't even good--they were bland and mushy. Oh, and they cost $14.  There is plenty of other places to eat on this block, go somewhere else.",

Only $10 too, which is a great price compared to other food in the city, as well as for the taste it was perfect. My boyfriend got the meatball sub which he said was delicious and he ate the whole thing, I didn\u2019t even get a chance to try it! We were the only ones in there since it was around 8:30 pm and there was a storm coming, but it was so peaceful inside. The staff were very friendly and recommended the carrot cake for dessert (DELICIOUS!) Next time I come to D.C. I will definitely be stopping in here to try something new.",
