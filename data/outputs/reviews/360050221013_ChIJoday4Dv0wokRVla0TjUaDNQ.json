        "caption": "Unfortunately the high priced experience has not been positive a positive one. Besides waiting 10 minutes for the cook to arrive with clean pots to make the meal I ordered and the time of preparation, the meals were prepared extremely poorly. Upon payment the cashier charged me a total of $43 by card; $13+ over. My order was for $26.00. One meal being $18 (Camarofongo/ Shrimp Monfongo) and a cuban sandwich for $8. She stated $6 was for tax And an additional $1 per meal. Once I physically wrote what she explained she noticed she was still $10 over which then gave me a ten dollar bill.  I explained to her that she was still over charging me because tax is not over 10% of any purchase.  She looked at me puzzled as I wrote it out and explained it again.  She did nothing. I left with my food,  a $43 charge to my card and a $10 bill for change.  Upon arriving home I open my meal and it is missing the gravy, half of the plate is salad and there are 5 pieces of shrimp in total. Place is a complete rip off.  Sadly we are facing a pandemic where it is impacting us in a financial level yet patrons of the near neighborhoods are taking customers forgranted. Prior to this review I attempted to call the store and ask about my meal and see if there was a way to resolve the matter but the woman said that's how it's made.  I related that I'd be giving a detailed review/ complaint and she stated that the business doesn't have any page or uber rates or anything online of the sort so it wouldn't matter. Regrettably I must say that the professionalism is at a poor rate along with the service in general.",
