        "caption": "This is my 3rd visit and Tambour, with their new chef, does not disappoint! What I like best are the complex flavor profiles he develops. They don\u2019t cut corners on spices and herbs or ingredients! I started with Red Baby Beet Salad, which is elevated above the rest by the perfect balance of sweet and salty tempered with creamy, grade A, goat cheese (it really tastes like goat cheese!) finished off with a drizzle of honey! My first entr\u00e9e, was the vegetarian Siciliano Cauliflower Steak. It\u2019s a snow white cauliflower roasted and compressed into a dense \u201ccut with a knife\u201d texture with a smoky, nutty taste enhanced by the addition of roasted pine nuts (sublime on their own), basil gremolata and raisins atop a base of Quinoa. From the ingredients you can see how the chef builds flavors. Next, I chose the Lasagna Bolognese Pasta. I gave up on Lasagna long ago, wearied of getting questionable noodles, nondescript red sauce, no cream or ricotta and smothered in low quality (tasteless) mozzarella. But this sauce is made with ribeye and filet, which I love! It was hand cut from a huge pan of lasagna made by the chef! This is not just thrown together from separate pots and broiled when ordered. This is real Bolognese sauce simmered to perfection with handmade tender pasta like it should be to absorb the sauce. I cringe hearing \u201cal dente\u201d for raw in the middle,  undercooked pasta AND risotto!!?@#! Tambour\u2019s lasagna actually has creamy Bechamel sauce created by the chef and is topped with \u201cfresh\u201d mozzarella and slivers of fresh basil. To tie all the ingredients together and brighten their flavors is the faintest hint of lemon zest!! WOW! I used the last of the bread to clean my plate! But even more, they suggest pairing wines that don\u2019t make sense until you put them together with the cuisine-even a wine from Lebanon! They know their wine and are spot on with their pairings. Dining should be fun and this is fun! This is not pretentious food (no foam, yay!) or atmosphere but fine dining at its best in a charming, cozy new restaurant! I\u2019ve eaten meals from Morocco to Fiji and I highly recommend Tambour!",

The owners Amy and Nicolas are wonderful and invested in the neighborhood feel of the place. Looking forward to many more meals.  Edit: Dinner could not be better. My husband had the Cuban sandwich (an evenings special) and can't stop talking about it. Of course the burger is also perfection. I loved the soups, exactly what I wanted this time of year. Every time we leave we are full and happy, what more can you ask for?  Edit: Brunch was perfect! Husband got an amazing burger and I got incredible French toast. Would definitely recommend. - They have also added $11 unlimited mimosas for 100minutes.",

I had a special, - The Lasagna w/rib-eye steak was amazing.(replacing the pork or ground meat was a great idea), super tender. Wines were a great selection and they have pairings, healthy menu, and tasty! It seems brand new, a little stark visually, but I expect it will fill in, but super clean. Live Jazz, Blues on weekend I'm told. I will travel from Manhattan for this quality for these prices.",

Last time I was there I had the Smoked Ribeye with Bok Choy and it was excellent. The steak had a decent amount of fat on it, I think more places need to do this. The Bok Choy was perfectly cooked, and it is refreshing to have steak not served with fries. Apart from the excellent food, the wine list here is well thought out and all the wine is affordable. The wine person has done an amazing job of sourcing some very good wines that will not break the bank, and I'm talking below $50. Sit at the bar and tell him what you like and he will come up with something you will enjoy. Service is prompt and very friendly. Finally there is always live music to enjoy (as long as you like jazz). This is a great local place to eat and hangout.",
