My husband got a meatball sandwich and some chicken parmesan while I selected the beef cannelloni and we were going to share a foccacia bread appetizer.  The pros/good points of the order: Our food arrived in a reasonable timeframe from doordash and the beef cannelloni tasted ok though the bread in the foccacia bread appetizer tasted differently than I hoped, though there was enough spinach/spring lettuce parmesan tomatoes to save in the form of a salad for another day.  The beef cannelloni was ok enough to save for another day just far from something I would order a second time around even though I normally enjoy certain forms of pasta.  I am grateful to have paid for the meal though the jury is out on if I would convince my husband to order from Frankie\u2019s Italian Kitchen & Bar (it was my idea for us to try this place and my husband had kindly agreed to the idea).",

We ordered two pastas - mine came with raw (seriously pink) meatballs and I was sick for two days. DoorDash refused to refund me because the restaurant wasn\u2019t cooperating. I was able to finally pick up a replacement item for the same value today on 9/14 and I even purchased a Tiramisu to accompany my \u201chopefully\u201d delicious calzone.  I should mention I had to fight to get the calzone initially because they didn\u2019t want to honor that I paid more for their food through DD than what\u2019s on their menu in-house. When I first let them know about my issue - they didn\u2019t really care much. It was appalling.  Now...  My calzone felt apart into Mariana sauce guts and little meat or cheese and it tasted like salt and sauce. I felt no love put in it and the dessert I purchased was definitely cheaply made and disappointing.  Poor customer service, food quality and high prices for why they offer - the U st location was good to me for years. This location is a joke.  P.S - Young lady working with blonde highlights was very nice at pick up. I was pointing out that the manager (sounded like a young man) over the phone wasn\u2019t very pleasant.  0/10 Would not recommend.",

        "caption": "Update: 09/14/19  Second time in for pickup. The first time the girl was not friendly, and I just ignored it.  This time, she said about two words, I paid. She walked away. No further communication.  I told her I would appreciate it if she would communicate with me. For instance, I requested a receipt, but didn't get it. I told her she should tell the customer how long it would take for their food to be ready and what was going on with the receipt -- as she just assumed I knew every part of the process.  The whole time, she just kept talking with a million excuses, but still no answers to the questions I wanted answers to.  She walked over to me later and decided she wanted to have a conversation about how she was going to give me a receipt (blah, blah, blah). Why couldn't she have done that after I paid instead of letting me just stand there like, what next?  She kept wanting to argue and I said to her three times, I'm done. She kept talking until I said, did you hear what I said? I'm done. She finally walked away.  A more customer friendly young man brought my food out and asked questions (i.e., communicated with me). I appreciate him, and their food, but this review has gone from \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 stars to \u2b50 and I will not be ordering from them again. They don't get that there are hundreds of other restaurants in the area.  Tip: When you walk by a restaurant or go in and there is never anyone sitting in there, take that as a clue that something is wrong. In this case there is a serious customer service issue.  The Italian Kitchen needs to read and respond to their reviews. SMH \ud83d\ude44  --------------------------------------------------  I ordered from the Italian Kitchen and had it delivered and have also ordered and picked up.  Both times I ordered the Manicotti Quattro Formaggi and Garlic Bread Stick and both times it was more than delicious. \ud83d\ude0b  I also ordered the chocolate cake, which was just okay.  The only complaint is that the first time the Manicotti had some really hot pepper \ud83e\udd75 in it that burned my mouth. Fortunately, it wasn't throughout just in a portion of the Manicotti. The next time I ordered it, there was no hot pepper.  I highly recommend this place. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

It's so simple, so delicious, just the right amount of choices where you're not going to be reading through the menu for eternity.

We had an excellent spinach salad, manicotti and ravioli (meatless all around). The red sauce was delicious on the manicotti and the entrees were served hot. I want to go back and try other dishes including the pizza. They serve beer on tap and wine. There are three screens often showing sports which isn't our preferred atmosphere but the sound was kept low.",

I was working as a pizzaiolo and at the company Condumax, leave the company Condumax. and I was already going to work as a pizzaiolo ... until dawn. Now I'm only at Condumax, a company of wires and cables. For you can conquer material goods, it is very difficult, even with two jobs, you can only pay the bills ... and you still have money to pay. Here in Brazil it's all ridiculous. Already to enjoy, could send an average Tuscany, for me here in Brazil ... I remembered can leave it ... because until delivery here in Brazil and very complicated. .. then I will have to pay tax of 60% of the price of the merchandise. And the rates ... so it would be much cheaper, I go to eat and there would still be change. Brazil is a joke ... to other countries.I thank you for your attention ... and come back always.thank you.

Pra pode conquistar  os bens materiais ,\u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil , at\u00e9 com dois empregos ,s\u00f3 consegue pagar as contas...e ainda fica faltando dinheiro pra pagar.aqui no Brasil \u00e9 tudo rid\u00edculo.

E mais as taxas...ent\u00e3o ficaria bem mais barato ,eu ir at\u00e9 a\u00ed comer .e sobraria troco ainda.

Second- When I got my pizza I have never seen something so watery in my life, did they not care about customer service. The pizza was so runny...The sauce and cheese along with topping slide right off. I had to eat the soggy bread will trying to gather the cheese, sauce had already detererated into the box. D.I.S.G.U.S.T.I.N.G! Third- When I spoke to the cashier she had the nerve to tell me their was nothing they could do about it....And they couldn't send me new food because delivery was over. Well they should because now they have a bad review, from me and others who are the trifling food. I repeat if you want to wage your money go here....",
