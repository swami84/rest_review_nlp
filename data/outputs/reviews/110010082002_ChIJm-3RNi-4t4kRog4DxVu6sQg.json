The soft serve dessert was a  treat and the area was clean and friendly.  My niece was with me who is gluten and dairy free and we were able to find good for her that was filling and tasty.  I think what we like best was that the patrons were from all walks of life. ait was obvious that there were people who worked there eating and interns from the Capitol Building across the street mixed with a bunch of tourists.  This would be a good, inexpensive place for a family or group to get a good meal and be able to sit and eat before adventuring again.",
