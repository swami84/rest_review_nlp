We first tried to go in the spring and weren't deterred by being the only people in the restaurant. However, we were immediately interrupted by jack hammering (during dinner service at about 7pm on a Friday) and the very apologetic server told us that unfortunately the noise would continue throughout the evening. So we left before sitting.  Our second try was this summer, looking for a cool respite happy hour and the air conditioning was broken. So we left before sitting.  We tried again now that the weather is cooler, hoping for a nice local dinner on a Saturday night. The server was painfully under-educated about the menu - every question we had she had to ask the manager and even brought cava for us to taste when we asked about what champagnes they had by the glass. For a French restaurant to only have Spanish bubbles and a server who doesn't know the difference is a problem. While we were waiting to order the server brought over a basked of extremely stale bread - again, for a French restaurant, embarrassing to say the least - and we decided to call it quits.  We will not be returning to Le Mistral and, while the food may be good, I doubt it and we will never know. It's a great location and they've done great things with the decor but I doubt it will still be around if they keep on not trying. That said, if you want a last minute table in the Slope on a Friday or Saturday night, this is your place - it is empty.",

        "caption": "The food at Le Mistral is delicious. Last night my partner and I went for an early dinner. She had the steak and I had the lamb chops. The lamb chops were tender and melt-in-your-mouth buttery. The steak was seasoned perfectly. The wait staff was just the right amount of attentive. They were always there when we needed them, but never pushy. The table next to us was empty, and they even connected it with ours to give us more room. We'll definitely be back soon!",
