I recommend the oolong milk tea low sweetened and add cheese foam on top. the Taiwanese sausage was good but I'd say it's over priced for what you get.",

Not too sweet (I got 50% sweetness) just how I like it. The logo is super cute too! Didn't stick around inside the store for long due to COVID, but it looked clean and well kept. There's an order kiosk too which was convenient. So glad that a good bubble tea place opened up where Bingo used to be!  2/27/2021 update: truly wish I could give this place 10 stars LOOK AT THE CUTE DRINK HOLDER!!!",
