        "caption": "We love Il Mulino at this location, and due to a lack of outdoor seating went next door (same kitchen, can order from same menu) to sit outside at AQ.  Here are the details:  - Definitely sit outside - views overlooking the ocean are a perfect 10 on a breezy night. - The AQ is supposed to be a \"Chop House\" but really there are very few meat and fish options (1-2 steak options only).  The initial offering is a tasty selection of olives, cheese and bread, but does not compare remotely to the Il Mulino olive oil and parmesan which they were very firmly refusing to bring over from around 100 feet away. Understandable but a shame considering you can order off either menu from the shared kitchen,. - We had the caesar salad (shockingly very small, with a too-citrusy dressing and no anchovies if you seek a legit caesar), the stracciatella soup (served pretty cold), fried calamari (amazingly  tender and tasty with great red sauce, but also served luke cold), for apps. For the main course, had kids butter pasta (way overcooked, but not a big deal), veal parmigiana (superb and vaguely tasted like Uno's pizza - very salty and but also delicious), and past with broccoli rabe and sausage (meh sausage light on flavor, not very hot - maybe luke warm - delicious rich truffle broth, overcooked noodles - overall pretty good).  Our son left hungry... - not a bad meal, a bit less costly than Il Mulino and ambience was amazing. Server was quiet, unengaged, but sort of ok - they like to keep pouring pelligrino to people drinking tap and vice versa - again, not a huge deal but not what we usually enjoy. - get the Spice menu at Il Mulino... skip AQ.  If you want a chop house you picked the wrong place... 25 dollar valet is \"reduced\" to $20 if you eat there - again, a lot of not-big-deals that added up to a so-so experience.",
