I couldn't in good faith recommend this place to anyone. Food was 3 out of 5 service was 4 out of 5 but I think that's only because the girl was drunk and flirting with me. Cleanliness was 1 out of 5. I went to the restroom before leaving and it looked like they had not cleaned the bathrooms in weeks!! It was disgusting. Maybe I need to try it another time but it wont be any time soon. I also was going in there with a warning that the \"owner\" was a short tempered rude miserable person but they were no where in sight. I think this was in the beginning of October sometime.",

Service was horrible and our server was quite rude from start to finish, way to talk smack in front of us the lady with short hair all tatted up,  food was mediocre, sake was cold and we were being rushed..

This is not AYCE, so I was prepared to pay more than what I was used to.  With that being said, I think $12 for Sapporo on tap is too much.  I ordered without realizing the price, but that's my fault.  The presentation of the food was beautiful.  The appetizer (tartar pyramid - $13.75), my salad (seaweed salad $5.75), and my entree (sashimi app $12) were plated nicely.  The portion of the pyramid was a little small, but I thought the salad and sashimi app were appropriately sized for the price and quality.  The fish was very fresh.  No fishy smell in this restaurant.  If you ever walk into a restaurant that smells fishy - you probably don't want to order sushi.  The sashimi app is chef's choice and got 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and sea bass plated with daikon radish and shiso leaves.  I also want to mention that they serve white ginger, which I love.  The service was slow, but it's a new restaurant.  I'm sure the kinks are still being worked out and servers may still be new and/or training.  I will say that everyone is super nice here.  The hostess, our server, and the sushi chef were all very friendly.  Overall, I really enjoyed my food and the atmosphere.  I will be back and am excited to try other things on the menu.  They have a decent cocktail menu that I will certainly hit up next time I'm here.",

I had the pleasure of meeting both owners, as they both work there and share their passion. It shows to. The decor, the quality of the food, the freshness and the authenticity as well.  I don't frequent too many Sushi places because after living in Japan, where I was first introduced to Sushi, it's just not the same thing here in the States. Well Kubo nails it. So glad they chose Elgin for this location. Besides delicious sushi, their Teriyaki Steak was simply outstanding as well as the Miso soup. So looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. I highly recommend Kubo .",

We waited quite a while but the server made up for it , however most people wont be as understanding as us \ud83d\ude02 also the noodles in the ramen were a little too hard, thats something to work on, other than that no actual complaints.

I had a ramen and a Kubo bowl and let me say, it was one of the most flavorful, elegant filling meals I have ever had!! The ramen was delightful as well but the bowl definitely took my little heart.

Sister and brother team, Melodi and Kris real know what theyre doing from the front and back of house to the carefully and wonderfully prepared dishes that are served. So glad Elgin finally has upscale sushi without being pretentious!!!",

The displays are beautiful and pleasing to the eye that not only is it delicious looking it is artfully designed and created with passion. His techniques are fluid to watch, much like a dance. Getting a seat at the bar will not only serve great food but also a show.  They serve miso soup and a ginger salad before the sushi.  Mind you, I do not like either of these things but this was a delight! Flavorful and fresh which I never had attributed those words to miso soup or ginger salad (which is usually drowned in ginger dressing) but not this! The sushi that followed only magnified the talent, passion, and sheer perfection this little sushi and sake lounge brings to Downtown Elgin!",
