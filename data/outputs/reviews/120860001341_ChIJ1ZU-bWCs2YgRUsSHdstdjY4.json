My only gripe which has happened several times is that when ordering takeout they don't put the fries in their own container and they don't poke holes in the take out boxes. Thus the fries often come out very soggy for delivery. They often can be resurrected in the toaster oven at home however and taste fresh as new. Love this little Aventura gem",

The Hummus was okay. The Salad was pretty good. The Chicken Souvlaki was good, which it was not too dry. The service was good and friendly. However, the price is little too high. The Chicken Souvlaki was $18.00. It is a little pricey! We will not go back again.  We will give it a 4.5 out of 10.",

I had the Hummus as a starter and the Chicken Souvlaki Platter, along with a soda, for my meal. Requested some more tzatziki sauce for my souvlaki and was charged for it. Tip suggestions of 15, 20 and 25% on receipt are based on POST TAX amount. Service was a little slow, it took 10 minutes for the hummus. My meal was ready 5 minutes later but sat on the counter for about 5 minutes before it was served. The chicken was bordering on over cooked but edible. Plate too small for food, uncomfortable to eat from because it's too crowded. Total charge for 1 person including 20% tip: $34.42.  The owner had an exchange of words with one of the waiters, in public - not appropriate.  Final assessment: Walk, don't run, especially if you are looking for real authentic Greek Food. Can not accommodate large parties due to size of location.",
