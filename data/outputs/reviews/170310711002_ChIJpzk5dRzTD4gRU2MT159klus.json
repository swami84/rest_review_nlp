A worker named Marianna answered the phone and told me there was no supervisor there. There was a long pause (like that was all she said and she expected me to be like okay thanks bye) and I finally said okay well how do I complain about my incorrect order. She simply stated the manager would be there in a few hours? Again, okayyyyy like do you want to take my information or ask me what happened with my order? To someone on the other end of the phone of such blunt statements it seems very rude and that you don\u2019t care about customer service. I had to ASK for her to write my information down so the manager could call me back when she got there. About 4 hours later I still hadn\u2019t received a call so I called the restaurant again. I was told again that there was was no manager there. How does a business go without having a supervisor on staff? Are you that arrogant that you don\u2019t care about someone handling customer service? I expressed my dissatisfaction and was finally connected by phone to the supervisor, \u201cGigi\u201d. She told me she heard about my incorrect order and stated \u201cwhat else do you want me to do about it?\u201d She made excuses and literally didn\u2019t offer me an apology about my order being incorrect. I was initially upset about the food but now it\u2019s completely about the rudeness. A simple apology during both encounters would have not resulted in this post. I know people make mistakes but as a business if you don\u2019t acknowledge or apologize for your mistakes then you simply don\u2019t deserve to have a business. As for the food , I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good because I didn\u2019t taste it nor will I be tasting it in the future.",

Manager saw us and apologized but then she kept on going with her conversation, we actually finished the coffee and nobody came to our table there after. So we got up and left, I don\u2019t even think the manager noticed us leaving even though it was not busy at all. She just kept on talking with the other customers. Absolutely insane!

Of course, I could have used the generic ATM that is in the restaurant, but I wasn't interested in paying a transaction fee on top of an already high bill.

Ordered and also added the bottom-less coffee, unfortunately only ended up with one cup and no refill needed. The PB hash looked great and the taste was not too bad other than it was extremely greasy.  Overall the meal was decent and did not realize they only except CASH only in small print on the bill and nothing outside showing that.  The good thing that I can see if you get a small discount if you are a DePaul Student.",

There are a great many choices in the area and this place is one to consider for its modern variants on traditional food.",

Jam N' Honey had a nice atmosphere, and it's in a fun location right on the DePaul campus. There's a lot to do around the area, so if you want to continue your morning you can stop by a plethora of coffee shops nearby (my personal recommendation would be Floriole).  That said, the food was mostly just okay. I didn't hate it, but Chicago has too many outstanding brunch locations to settle for just okay. In fairness, I ordered a Pork Belly Hash, and my impression being there was that the waffles/pancakes/french toast was the main reason people go there. The coffee also wasn't great, but again wasn't awful either.  Overall, it was a run of the mill brunch experience. If somebody invited me to go back there I would, but I wouldn't likely suggest going there if it were up to me.",

My good experience was made sour by the fact that both my friend and I had to use the ATM which states 'Jam and Honey has a $3 charge on this ATM' - so what we thought was decently priced a $10 entree quickly became an overpriced $13 entree. Yes it is my fault for not always having $30 cash on me, but for the owners of this establishment to push this fee to their customers seems shady to me, take credit cards and hide the extra $1 fee in the price of each item, I'd be more cool with that. Also note, I did not see it advertised anywhere until we were told at the end of our bill, probably an overlook by me but when I'm president all places that dare to be CO will be forced to tattoo it on every employees forehead.  Nice little sidewalk patio, but the intersection it sits on is kind of busy and distracting.  South of the Border Burrito - Scrambled Eggs, Chorizo, Black Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Pepper Jack and Pico De Gallo Served with House Potatoes - $10 --- Good and hearty, the potatoes had added flavor of sauteed bell peppers but were very starchy and could have benefited by being a little crispier.  Honestly nothing blew me out of the water about this place, certainly is no Nookies, which consequently ditched the cash only thing long ago! I will probably give them another chance at some point but you can bet your booty that I will be packing some Benjamin's... probably more like an Andrew Jackson, but CASH ONLY!",

Plus, they topped it off with their own unique tomato jam which is delightfully sweet. It makes the overall bite pop with flavor.  I also had their special chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint. It had the same tomato jam and the chicken was cooked nicely. But the main star was the fries. It was freshly fried and seasoned perfectly. Crispy, crunch, full of flavor. I could not stop eating them.  Some quick tips - this place is cash only, there is usually a queue to be prepared for a 20-25 min wait and finally, sitting outside eating great food is awesome in summer.",
