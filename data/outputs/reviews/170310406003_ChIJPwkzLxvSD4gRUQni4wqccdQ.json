Keep in mind my total was only $30.  He gave himself nearly a $50 dollar tip (forgive me if my math is incorrect).  Also, I get it, I should not expect all diverlery drivers to walk around with that amount of change but considering that he worked for the restaurant he could have kept the food, got the change and come back...I would rather wait until he makes his other deliveries and have cold food than pay $77 for $30 worth of subpar orange chicken.  I followed up with the restaurant, they told me they would speak to the driver and follow up with me about my refund and guess what?....I never heard from them again.
