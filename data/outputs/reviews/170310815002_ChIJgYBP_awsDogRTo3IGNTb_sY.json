When I got there I was ignored for awhile sitting at the bar. I have to get the bartender\u2019s attention to tell him I\u2019m there to pick up the order. I have the receipt on my phone, and as he is quickly walking by, just says we don\u2019t have bean burritos anymore. Then he brings me the 1 page paper menu stating the menu changed, and I\u2019ll have to pay more for a different item. I prepaid already online and showed him a picture of what I ordered. It is the meal which has 2 bean and cheese burritos with a side of rice and beans. So, he says okay, we\u2019ll make you a bean burrito. I was expecting to get what I actually ordered, but what I got was just 1 bean burrito, no cheese, no rice & beans. So by the way, after I\u2019m sitting there for a while, the guy never mentioned they don\u2019t have the tamales that I paid $13 for. Like, I was just out of luck. I had to have an argument with the guy and say they have to give me something since I\u2019ve already been charged. So I tell him I\u2019ll take tacos instead. Never mind those were a lower priced item. They never offered me any compensation. I just want to leave and never return at this point so I\u2019m not going argue about it. If I had not kept on them, I\u2019m guessing they would have given me nothing. So, I also ordered queso dip and a guacamole. Like after I\u2019m sitting there a half hour (after the original order was supposed to be ready) the guy comes out and says they don\u2019t have any queso. At this point I\u2019m ready to cry. He offers me double guacamole. I said okay. He then says to me, \u201cThis is not our fault.\u201d Um, yes, this is the restaurant\u2019s fault. They need to either fix their menu online or withdraw themselves from online ordering services until they can correct it. Just to add insult to injury, they never asked me if I wanted a drink, not even water, while I waited for a half hour during this whole debacle. I can\u2019t even eat the food now. I\u2019m afraid of what they might have done to it. As I left, I was singing Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u2018Never Again\u2019 in my head.  I wished I would have just stayed home. This is officially my worst restaurant experience of all time.",

The free chips and salsa they give were both really good but that\u2019s were it ended.  I had the Ranchero Burrito, my husband had Steak Fajitas.  My husband said his fajitas were well made but bland no seasoning.  My burrito was not good at all.  It was also bland and rice not fully cooked through.  I\u2019m just not a fan of how they season their food...if they do because my chicken in the burrito tasted just like chicken no spices at all, which I was completely expecting.  There also was no cheese in my burrito so that was a huge disappointment.  Lastly, not sure how they make their guac but something about it was off...had a weird taste.  We often travel and have ate at several places.  This was hands down worst \u201cauthentic\u201d we\u2019ve had.  I won\u2019t be returning when back in town as we visit Chicago often.

I arrive very late in the Su Casa, and feel right at home: ambience up to the wall tiles looks very typical Mexican, very simple and yet furnished with great attention to detail. The typical Mexican music, and best of all: The staff is both cordial and pragmatic. When I asked if the kitchen was still cooking, Mama replied that they would be leaving work soon, but that there are still many things left. I ask for fajitas with chicken, and she quickly suggests a good meal that is built around my desire. The food is delicious, although the portion is a bit small. The Mojito is just as fresh and tasty. It follows a second. Here I ate very good Mexican for quite a few dollars. 1 star deduction because of the small portion.  (Original) Gerne wieder! Ich komme sehr sp\u00e4t noch ins Su Casa, und f\u00fchle mich auf Anhieb wohl: Ambiente bis hin zu den Wandfliesen wirkt sehr typisch mexikanisch, sehr einfach und doch mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet. Dazu spielt die typisch mexikanische Musik, und das beste: Das Personal ist sowohl herzlich als auch pragmatisch. Auf meine Frage, ob die K\u00fcche noch etwas koche, antwortet die Mama, dass man demn\u00e4chst Feierabend mache, aber dass es vieles noch gebe. Ich frage nach Fajitas mit H\u00e4hnchen, und schnell schl\u00e4gt sie ein gutes Gericht vor, dass um meinen Wunsch herumgebaut ist. Das Essen ist sehr lecker, wenn auch die Portion etwas klein ist. Der Mojito ist ebenso frisch und lecker. Es folgt ein zweiter. Hier habe ich f\u00fcr recht wenige Dollars sehr gut mexikanisch gegessen. 1 Stern Abzug wegen der etwas kleinen Portion.",

        "caption": "This place has gone through many changes through the years, but the latest changes have been the worst. They've reduce the size of the menu from five pages to two. They've changed suppliers and have whittled everything down to basic food, there used to be texture, flavor and choices here but my recent experience doesn't make me want to return even though my family have been going here for the better part of over 30 years.  When I was there earlier tonight the queso had a taste of sweat and was unenjoyable, previously they used different spices and flavors to make it something that was impossible not to eat. I followed that up with a fajita steak burrito, now I understand that sauces can be put on a burrito but when you drench it in sauce to the point where I cannot pick it up and eat it like it's meant to be eaten, I'm not happy. I had to use a fork and knife on a burrito that had rubbery steak, their previous owner would use steak that would be marinated at least and that did not feel like I was chewing a rubber band. I want this place to be better, I came here ever since I was a child but now I think those memories are where I'll visit this place in the future.  Today it's a one star restaurant, I gave it one extra for the memories and how it used to be. Save your money and go to Chipotle.  ----Update---- 10/18/19 Visiting here for another family function. It's terrible, not much has changed from what what stated above but when you pay $20 for a steak and half of it is pure fat mixed with real meat it makes you think they're serving meat glue steaks. It's obvious that they've decided to use the cheapest food suppliers rather than quality suppliers.  Don't come here unless you want to waste your money on trash.",

My husband and I stopped by this place a few months ago one Sunday afternoon.... during that time period after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd. We asked to be seated outside on the patio. The waitress came over saw us and immediately was rude and dismissive. We ordered 2 drinks. About 3 min later she came back over to took are food orders. We weren't quite ready but what ever, we where hungry so not a huge deal. I didnt realize something was off until she came back immediately after dropping off our order at kitchen with our check. What?!?  We hadn't even received our drinks yet and the waitress was already bring out our bill telling us that we can pay when we are ready. I with a hint of naivete responded by telling her that we had not yet received our order. The waitress then rolled her eyes, aggressively snatched the bill up off the table, and walked away. That was the last time we saw her until we flagged her down for our bill when we were done. No chips and salsa, no water refills, no 2nd round of drinks, no periodic check ups. We could not have felt more unwelcomed. The waitress either wanted to rush us through our meal & out the door because we were gay OR more likely, she was not so discreetly trying to suggest that we needed to pre-pay for our food...possibly because I am African American. Either way, the service was awful, our experience was awful, & I am never going back.",

The taco was just sad looking. Best part was the free chips lmaooooo... Definitely not authentic. Also drinks were not great either I had a margarita. Will not go back.

The margaritas were $18 each and were only 12 ounces of watered down crushed ice. So disappointing. The chips and salsa were great! But the tableside Guacamole was lame and flavorless! And speaking of flavorless, the fajitas were WAY overcooked and totally lacking in seasoning! The black beans were actually good but were not refined and the Mexican rice was white sticky rice with cilantro sprinkled in top! The chef said this is how they do it in Mexico...ummm....which Mexico are you talking about friend...just a bad experience. Not worth the effort! Finally, I felt that we should let them know,  they told us we just didnt KNOW flavors! WOW",

When we got there we had to wait for the three hostesses to figure our where to seat us, even when there we're plenty of seats available. I spotted a table by the window on the section to the side of the door (facing the stained glass). I noticed there were napkins on the other table in the section so didnt say much.  Our lovely waiter came by and we ordered two michelada to start. Both were disappointing and flavorless. We then ordered the shareable plater that has dried taquitos, quesadillas, and nachos. We decided to select chicken for all. When we received, believe me when I say, chicken was served. The quesadilla was stuffed with chicken. Only good thing about the platter were the taquitos. Again, disappointing.  To finish off, the hustle, and rumble on the 5 de Mayo day was annoying. The restaurant was empty and no need for so much panicking. What really killed the cool vibe the restaurant gives was the fact that they put the hostess and another waitress to wrap silverware on the table next to us. The chiming and constant noise they were making made me lose my appetite to order more. Not only were they wrapping them there but they were also gossiping about the workplace, how they were underpaid, overworked, and how it was hard to say no. Needless to say I was annoyed. I just asked for the check and walked out. Horrible experience.",

When one of our female guests left the restroom on the way out of the restaurant our waitress confronted her and said that we probably just didn't have enough money.  Classy.  We usually tip very well, you just didn't deserve it.   To top it off, food is mediocre compared to most Mexican restaurants we have been in.",

The chicken in mole sauce was delicious as well as the chicken enchiladas we had. Their soup of the day was a tortilla soup, which I thought was far off because it had tortilla chips and not actual tortillas. It had the consistency of a bean dip more than a soup. Regardless, it was savory. The service was ok, nothing more. I\u2019d go again, but with a bigger group since the layout of the restaurant seems to accommodate bigger groups rather than 2 people on a date. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and it truly feels like you\u2019re at home and the classic Mexican songs playing one after another makes the atmosphere that much enjoyable.",

I\u2019ve never at here and I never will (I will explain why, just bear with me it\u2019s gunna be a long story. SO WORTH READING EVERYTHING THOUGH) , PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE.  Like I said I\u2019ve never ate here. The reason I found out this place is so disgusting is bc I worked there! I desperately needed a job one summer (at the time I was 19) so I just walked in and politely asked if they were hiring. The manager, which is like a muscular Mexican guy (somewhere in his 40s) said he could definitely use me. He then told me to come back tmrw at 8am.  The day has come, it\u2019s a Monday and I show up. The first thing he has me do is listen to another guy around my age (his name is johnathan) because he was gunna show me how to open the restaurant. I was hired as a dishwasher/busser. The guy (johnathan) starts telling me we just have to pick the chairs up and sweep and mop the whole restaurant. Immediately as I take my first step on the floor I feel that it\u2019s EXTREMELY sticky. Mind you, I\u2019ve worked at other restaurants before so I thought it\u2019d be like any other. NO. No other restaurant I\u2019ve ever worked at has had a sticky floor from all the food that falls on the floor. I desperately needed a job so I tough it out. Then probably I swear to god 5 mins into me sweeping I sweep up 2 HUGE ROACHES from under the table. I never worked at a restaurant with roaches that are actually IN and ON the diner floor. Even the broom and mop they gave me to use felt so sticky greasy and was full of pieces of food ON THE HANDLE, not the broom or the mop itself BUT THE HANDLE. Then it probably took me about 20 mins to sweep. And I kid you not within those 20 mins I swept up AT LEAST 10 roaches!! YES, I SAID TEN ROACH, ONLY WHILE I SWEPT. After I was done by that every step  I took it with so much paranoia bc I was scared I would step on a roach(which I did twice).  Now I\u2019m supposed to mop I start mopping and I realize it doesn\u2019t matter if you kill one or two bc they will just multiply. While I mopped the whole restaurant I killed I\u2019d say about another 8 HUGE ROACHES. If I had to take a guess I would say every roach I found was at least anywhere from 1 whole in to maybe 1 inch and a half. I promise you guys I wanted to take my phone out and record so bad but the only reason I didn\u2019t was bc I was so disgusted to even grab my phone with the same hands I was grabbing the mop with.  After I was done with this I was probably an hour into the job.  Then johnathan takes me to the storage room to stock up for the morning. The storage room is in a whole other building. We go up the stairs and in the storage room the room is so dirty it honestly looks like it\u2019s never ever been cleaned. AND on top of that the room was as hot as outside! This was all around July of 2018. Very few of the items are kept in a fridge/freezer. The only things kept cool are stuff like dairy products. The tomatoes, onions, vegetables and eggs are just left out in a small room which is just as hot as outside. He tells me to take some tomatoe boxes to the kitchen. I\u2019m pickup tomatoe boxes that are stacked maybe a bit shorter than me (I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d). Once I get to probably the third to last box I can now see the floor. And on the floor corner which is I\u2019d say 2-3 feet from where the boxes where piled I see a DEAD RAT ON A RAT TRAP. YES!! I kid you not there was a dead rat laying around all the produce.  After I saw that I could not take it anymore. ABSOLUTELY NO money is enough to have me work under those conditions. I walked out without telling anyone anything probably less than two hours into my first ever shift. Never been there since.  The reason I wrote this review is to inform the public on what really goes on there. People literally eat where roaches live and rats die. For any type of food business that is UNACCEPTABLE. Please guys do not go here. I do not know how this place is still running! This place needs to be shut down and sanitized ASAP!",

We had been to a few mexican restaurants in the area that don't come close to the quality of Su Casa. From the chips and an outstanding salsa, the 1800 margarita's (made with fresh ingredients) . We ordered the steak/chicken fajitas...seasoned perfectly. The beans and rice were taste like homemade. The tortillas were a perfect compliment to the fajitas and some of the best we've ever had at a restaurant. The service was also wonderful and welcoming. We will certainly return. Our only request, that we voiced with the restaurant, is that we hope they start serving carnitas. Thank you Su Casa, see you again soon.",

I ordered queso fundido and the cheese was stringy and not dip-able at all. SO ordered the tacos which from report were good, but they looked like I could have made them at home. The beans looked dried out and the rice from a box. I guess the margaritas are good but we didn't have them.

That to me shows me great customer service and I obviously came back for the food. I definitely recommend this place.",

The staff were friendly enough so I would rate the service a 4 out of 10  Drinks: I ordered a classic margarita and it was delivered rather quickly. It came in a short glass but was two salty for my taste. I would rate the drinks a 2 out of 10  Food: I ordered the tacos racheros (steak) and the food was delivered rather quickly but it left nothing to be desired. I have had tacos that have had more flavor from a street corner. I also had my daughter and niece with me who order queso and quamole which they stated \"was nasty\". I would rate the food a 2 out of 10.  My opinion: skip this restaurant if you are looking to experience  excellent food choices or you will be disappointed unless you have a palette that does not require well seasoned food with pride and love in the recipe.",
