This is because there is no limit on the amount of boxes you can get. multiple people ordering 6-8 boxes means a longer wait. Had I'd known, I would have thought twice before going and I agree with a previous yelper that there should have been a limit to prevent running out of ingredients, and having a shorter wait. Note there are 3 people running the pop up as well.  But despite the long wait, the donuts were fluffy, fresh, bubbly, and for some reason it reminded me of a funnel cake. I got a dozen which included the taro sugar, blueberry and black sesame. I surprisingly loved the black sesame. It reminded me of a classic red bean mochi, it wasn't too sweet and really good. The blueberry didnt taste artificial at all and tasted like fresh blueberries. The one I didnt enjoy so much was the taro sugar only because it was mostly like sugar.  An update is that I just got to try them again. The donuts deflated and now I get why it its called modo. The donuts now have the exact consistency of mochi. Like before it was mostly more of a donut but now its flavored mochi. I wish I can get more, but the line though...",

We tried every flavor available that day and cookies and cream was a top favorite. The icing/frosting is very light in flavor. I would recommend this place for a doughnut or two.

They have a lovely chewy texture and are shaped like many balls connected so they are easy to eat and share. Oreo cookie is definitely my families favourite. I enjoyed the lilikoi one as well. I agree with others that the matcha was a disappointment wish it had more flavour. Black sesame was also good. But all doughnuts were addictive and yummy.  We brought a dozen home to Canada.",

Definitely one of the more trendy places on the island or as most Yelpers would deem a \"gem.\"  Nothing too impressive about the flavors.  The matcha was definitely lacking and could've used more matcha and less sugar.  I believe whatever they use in the icing had a mild nutty flavor which over powered the black sesame donut as the flavors settled on my palette.  Also, got the coffee or espresso whatever and a key lime donut.  Overall, wasn't too impressed with the flavors. Presentation, however, is awesome.  Love the colors and interesting shape.",

Each doughnut has a light texture and is nicely frosted with neither too thick or too thin sugar coating.  The display counter is visually appealing and when we ordered, the cashier selected doughnuts from a rack just behind a wall. Enjoy right there or can be packaged for take away.",

The flavors change occasionally, but at this time, lilikoi and black sesame are my favorites.  During my most recent visit, they had eleven flavors. Lilikoi, green tea, black sesame, espresso, Hawaiian honey, chocolate, strawberry, lime, white chocolate, cookies and cream, and Earl Grey. Prices range between flavors from $1.50 to $2.  I've so far stopped by five-ish times, each time experiencing excellent service. Especially since they just recently opened, the quality of the donuts and capability of the staff are superb.  Mention that you're kama'aina and you'll get 5% off your order. I'm not sure if MoDo stands for More Donuts or Mochi Donuts, but either way, works for me!",
