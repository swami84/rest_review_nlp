I think that perhaps the people cooking dont have a true love for the amazing flavors that you can get in veg cuisine. The burgers are good but really its all the sauces that help out. Yes, yes thats the point right..the sauce..? Sauce should enhance not save the meal. The vegan gravy on the poutine is also bland.
