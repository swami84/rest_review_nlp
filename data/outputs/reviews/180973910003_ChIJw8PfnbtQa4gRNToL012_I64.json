We were seated right away and a guy came by and said he'd be right with us. In the meantime a girl came by with water and took our drinks. The server came back and took our order. I went with the grilled cheese and my partner ordered the grilled chicken panini. Our food came out in an ok time and the order came out wrong. Mine was right but instead of the panini it was another grilled cheese. When he dropped off the food he told me he would return with a Pepsi for me. That never happened. We flagged down the server and told him that the order was wrong. He apologized and said he would get it right out. \"Right out\" meant anothrt 15 minute wait. During that wait we never saw him again...never got refills, nor has the table been cleared. In fact at the time of writing this the table still hasn't been cleared. To get a refill we flagged down someone who had another girl bring our drinks. When we asked for the manager, his food finally came out. She did come to the table but all she said was that she was sorry. This whole experience has been a let down...and I don't see returning again.",
