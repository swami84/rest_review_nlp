Service was typical for a mom and pop owned Asian restaurant.  As one would expect, COVID has caused them to put interesting measures in place to protect themselves and their customers. Rules are clearly written in English on the door entering the restaurant and at the table. This helped in setting our expectations prior to committing. They took a more stringent approach to protect everyone (as compared to other restaurants we dined) and we appreciated the effort.  Food was well priced for the proportions and tasted great!  It was apparent that the two people who were working were not well versed in English, but they tried their best. The lady took our order, repeated it back to ensure accuracy and we received what we ordered. From the time we sat down to the time we received our order was about 15 minutes.  We will definitely visit again!",

We typically get our pho from Pho Kim Long and we\u2019re picky on broth since we\u2019re Asian and can make it at home. Anyway, once we got there we were greeted by an older woman (maybe owner?). As other diners said, reception wasn\u2019t very warm. We (family of 4) were the only diners around 3:15 pm.  Ordered: 1 combo pho 1 well-done beef pho 1 order of spring rolls 1 combo fried rice  It took about 10 minutes to get our spring rolls. The kids loved it. I am obsessed with their spring roll sauce. Best we\u2019ve had so far in Vegas! It\u2019s got a slight spicy kick to it and it\u2019s not super thick. Would order this again for sure.  Hubby loved his combo pho. I LOVE their broth! Omg. It\u2019s got a sweeter kick to it and I love that! I didn\u2019t add any hoisin or sriracha. Meat was plentiful (I notice Pho Kim Long meat and noodle portions are VERY small for what they consider a large size - ugh). I\u2019m amazed at the pho broth quality here. I\u2019d eat here more regularly if it wasn\u2019t 30 minutes away!  Combo fried rice was delicious but not a lot of meat, which was surprising. Maybe 6 pieces of shrimp total but the other meats were minced. It was like a fried rice with small bits or chicken or beef (smaller than the size of a pea).  That was the only disappointment but the flavor was definitely there.  5/5 for the pho and spring rolls. Towards the end of our dining experience the older lady was warmer in personality. Would definitely come back in the future. Just wish we didn\u2019t live so far away. What a great hidden gem in Henderson!!",

Both were delicious. The calamari was salt and pepper style. And the spring rolls were very fresh tasting.  I had the tendon pho. The beef broth was just amazingly delicious. It had seven spice seasoning with just the right amount of star anise. The tendon was cooked until it was so tender. The wife had the shrimp with rice noodles. It came with this fish sauce which was slightly sweet and salty . When you poured it on top, it elevated the flavors. She loved it. And loved the fact that they had gluten free noodles. They also have vegan options.  The service was very friendly. I spoke to the chef, he was very nice and very appreciative when we told him how great everything was.  We will definitely be back. There isn't a place to get great pho for at least 10 miles.  And if you are coming from the other side of town, it's worth the drive!  We live to see small businesses thrive and I can see this place being very successful",

Food was also very good - I went with the veggie pho with the veggie broth instead of beef and was pleased!

I had the Rare Steak Pho and they give you generous amounts of meat, combined with a really great broth and your typical rice noodles. Seriously, the broth is SO good I didnt even need or want to add any sriracha, soy sauce, or anything!  The only few downsides are the fact their menus are printed out on paper and dont have their drinks listed, but I just assume it's because they're brand new and may be waiting on them. The pho is about a dollar more expensive than the other shops closer to/in Vegas, but that's no matter for me since it's so close to my home and the pho is great quality.  Overall, fantastic offerings. Can't wait to see where they go from from here.",
