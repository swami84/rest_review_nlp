I would go back to sit in the room and have a few glasses of wine, a coffee, and a panani. The bread basket is astounding. We're in the neighborhood and have eaten at all of 5 Italian restaurants near Front St. I'd suggest ramping up the food program so the taste is up to par with the pricing.

It was $40 for three small pieces of meat and a small dish of chopped tomatoes on the side. And it tasted no better than Olive Garden.  For breakfast the next morning, everything tasted better but something happened in the kitchen. We were seated rather quickly. It was kind of early and there weren't too many guests in yet. We placed our orders. More diners funneled in. And then it seemed like the kitchen just slowed to a grinding halt. Nearly every table in the restaurant was full, but no one had any food, including us. About 45 minutes after we placed our orders, our dishes arrived.  I'd expect that wait for myabe a rotisserie chicken, but it's kind of long wait for something like scrambled eggs and bacon.",

        "caption": "Bellini (named so after the much celebrated mixed drink, invented, according to the tradition, by Giuseppe Cipriani, a Venetian bartender and the patriarch of the Cipriani family who owns Mr C Seaport hotel where the restaurant is located) doesn't operate its own website. Thus the menu can be looked at Mr C Seaport hotel's website only. The prices are not listed. After having our lunch there we wonder why. Our lunch, consisting of 2 appetizers (crudo tasting and grilled octopus), 1 Fritto Misto (seafood mixed grill), one \"budget\" pasta (cacio e pepe, usually the cheapest pasta), 1 shared dessert and 2 glasses of wine cost us MORE than a full 3-course dinner with a bottle of good southern Rh\u00f4ne wine, by a Michelin-star chef, on the same evening. That is not right, neither it is justified by the food quality, plating nor service. The service was friendly but definitely inept. The crudo tasting of three different fishes was not presented nor explained, we still have no idea what were we eating. While the crudo tasting was good, and so was our grilled octopus with eggplant puree, the main courses ranged from very ordinary (bucatini cacio e pepe) to mediocre (fritto misto) to outright poor (macedonia di frutto dessert). The breakfast prices were better but the food resulted, again, in mixed impressions. The Venetian frittata was quite decent but the avocado toast was atrociously bad, served on a godawful joke of a toast. Sometimes a high quality hotel doesn't find a good match in its \"house\" restaurant. Our experience in Bellini completely fit the negative stay at Mr C Seaport, of which there is a dedicated review left.",

        "caption": "Awful and disgusting service, Roach in my food and disgraceful racist Russian waitress Olga. In addition one of the Italian Manager Emauele racist behavior toward blacks customers is unacceptable and we will report him ASAP. This restaurant had been recommend to us by a close friend so we went Friday night for my 10 years old daughter birthday celebration. We had the table in the front next to the bar area. Our Russian Waitress Olga was absolutely unprofessional, rude and racist individual that doesn't belong working with the public nor in a Restaurant. Our Blonbie Russian waitress Olga, that doesn't even speak proper English, needs to be fired immediately and doesn't have any fine dining experience whats so ever. She didn't even know how to greet us in a professional manner. We waited at least 30 minutes at the table before we got to order our drinks which 2 out of 3 were delivered wrong. After complaining that there was a bug (roach) into our food, our waiterress Olga finanlly decided to ignore us and to simply walk away by calling me a P..t.a. in Spanish which translated in English means B..t..h. In addition she refused to remove my gnocchi from the check! We asked him to bring us bread at least 3 times and never got any. Also we never ordered a bottle of Pellegrino and was never taken off our guest check. Our Mr Italian Emauele Manager has ZERO hospitality and absolute NO fine dining experience. Very rude, uneducated and unprofessional dude that doesn't belong working in a Restaurant. He didn't even congratulated my 10 years old birthday girl. The White wine bottle ordered from Christian another Mexican waiter was the wrong bottle because i ordered a bottle of Prosecco and instead Christian brought us a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. We sat down at 7 and didn\u2019t get our apetizers and salads till 8:05pm Also our main courses were served after another 50 minutes later. My daughter (Birthday Girl) had an allergic reaction to the pasta simply because we asked our waiter that she has allergic to gluten and could have gotten really sick. Instead our waitress Olga never confirmed with the kitchen that my daughter need it a gluten free pasta and instead he ordered the regular gnocchi from the menu with a Roach bug inside. I can confirm that we never ordered the gnocchi but instead of serving my daughter gluten free pasta they served her gnocchi, which is made with regular flour with gluten. Also they brought us the wrong dish to my husband because we never ordered the Salmon simply is allergic to seafood. My question is whom in the right mind would serve gluten to a 10 years old girl with gluten allergy? Just incompetent and not skilled waiter and a poor Restaurant with zero Management. Also very aggravating is the fact that 3 out of the 4 main courses came out cold not to talk about my daughter gluten free pasta that never made it to the table. Our Ravioli Tartufo Bianco were Cold, the Octupus Carpaccio wss extremely salty and the Lamb Chops were too tough, overcooked and cold. I asked for temperature Med Rare and not Well done. Very disappointed with our meal. When a complaint was filed to our Waiter-Manager Emanuele he simply walked away his answer was \u201cthis is not true\u201d or \u201cyou didn\u2019t wait that long for salads or main courses and didn't removed the gnocchi ( with a bug inside) from our check\" Very bad customer service on his part. Whatever happened to pleasing the customer. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND",

So here\u2019s my review: Space/decor: 5/5 Cute decorations, really cozy space. Service: 5/5 Left nothing to be desired. Waiters were amazing. Bathrooms:4/5 I\u2019m docking off a star because there wasn\u2019t any towels in 2 of the bathrooms. There were a ton of towels in the one bathroom though (?). But the bathrooms were nice and clean. Food: 5/5 The veggies and cheese were amazing, as was the bread and the main course. We got the lasagna, the gnocchi, cacio de Pepe (sorry for spelling), tuna carpaccio,and salad. It was all astoundingly good. For dessert, we got lemon pie, tiramisu, profiterls and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The lemon pie was amazing, the tiramasu was great, the profiterls were soooo good, and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was splendid. Overall, an amazing restaurant. Definitely go. \u2022EDIT\u2022 We also got amazing coffee and cocktails.",
