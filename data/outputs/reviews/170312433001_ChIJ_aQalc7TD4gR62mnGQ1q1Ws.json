Many of the ingredients are imported directly from Morocco, and the owner (Simon) even showed off some after dinner tea with the \"made in Morocco\" logo.  Everything was awesome, and it takes real guts to open a restaurant in a Pandemic.  This location is on Chicago Ave in the former Havana Libre space.  I hope they have many prosperous years at this new location.  The space is spread out as nice as possible with safety precautions.  Everything is done with safety in mind, but the real reason to go is the fantastic food and service!  It was my first night at a restaurant in a few months, and this experience really WOWED us.",
