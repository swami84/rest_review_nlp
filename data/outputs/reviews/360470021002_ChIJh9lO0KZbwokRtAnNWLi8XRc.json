We understood they were short staffed, but laughing in her face when she was upset about it probably wasn\u2019t the solution.  And then berating her and telling her (because she\u2019s also in the food industry) that he hopes this doesn\u2019t affect her work ethic was pretty wild.  If you forget someone\u2019s order you would normally apologize , not act like it was our fault.  Again the food was amazing , the manager or owner , was just really bad at his job , probably had to do with his \u201cterrible work ethic\u201d.  Come at your own risk.",

Definitely not Mexican food, so gentrified and for the tourists its gross. How is this business even still open.  Also How are they only doing in person orders during a pandemic? Very unsafe.

I comport myself civilly and appropriately, especially when I am out with my work colleagues. No one acknowledged me anytime I went to the bar for service and I was the biggest black thing in that bar. My boyfriend, who is white, had to step in several times and finally acknowledged how I was giving my hard earned money to them without respectful acknowledgement or being told thank you. I do not believe in family separation and indefinitely detaining humans seeking asylum, however, I do believe establishments like this should be shut down! I hated every ounce of my experience at this dump.",
