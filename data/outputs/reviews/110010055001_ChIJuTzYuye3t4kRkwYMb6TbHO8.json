They don't do substitutes, but you can add notes on your order online. Got there right on time and stood at the table they had blocking the door for COVID. Wasn't sure whether to push the button on the remote that was on the table or not, but a worker saw me and came out. Order was ready and came in a paper bag with two containers with lids, but no utensils or napkins (maybe they're trying to be eco-conscious). Food was still hot when I got back to where I was staying 20 mins later and was so good!  The prices seemed a little high for fast casual at first, but the portions are large enough to split between two meals (especially if you're not someone who tends to eat a lot in a single meal). I got the cumin lamb stir fry and it was spicier than I had anticipated and contained shiitake mushrooms, onions, fried shallots, green onions, cabbage or bokchoy, and fall-apart tender lamb. I ate mine out of the container, but the spices in the sauce all collected at the bottom, so if you're trying to distribute the spice evenly, I'd suggest putting it in a separate bowl and stirring. You can't even really taste that the noodles are wheat flour in case that's a concern. The other dish ordered was the Chicken+the Egg fried rice and it was also very tasty with a slight char to the rice (like in Korean stone pot rice). I think ordering a couple things and eating family style is the best way to go with their offerings.",

We started with the soju in-house cocktail that was perfectly balanced (I had two) and thirst-quenching. Then the side dishes came out, six in total, pretty amazing and full of diverse and rich flavors. The potato and egg salad, kimchi, chilled shrimp, and turmeric pickled daikon were my favorites. Next came the first wave of main menu items. Then another wave. Finally, dessert. The shrimp toast, chicken, smashed salmon, chopped brisket, and in-house spicy sauce were all equally amazing in their own right. I wish I had known the amount of food that would be served, for I would have skipped lunch. Lastly, all of the staff were very friendly and professional. Great conversation and music to compliment the whole experience. Will return, although not before trying the other locations first.",

It's small and no reservations (you place your order, pick up a number, and find a table) so you may have to wait but it moves quickly. They do have a chef's counter that you can book in advance - on my 2020 bucket list!",

(Banana peppers, hard boiled egg and \u201cbrisket\u201d) Why does their version of brisket taste like hot dog meat? And finally why does this place have good reviews?  All of their meals appear to be 3 ingredients, their avocado salad for example was made up of cucumbers, avocado, and radish.  Which is fine, but their price point is delusional, even for DC. Food was greasy and lackluster.  I went in starving and was sorely disappointed.  Finally, for a place that touts itself as fast casual, it seems odd that they default the suggested tip to 30% at the register.  I never mind tipping 20% or more, but 30% at a restaurant in which the only service you receive is them bringing a tray to your table I take issue.  If you want fusion, I highly recommend finding any other fusion restaurant in DC(Far East Taco Grill is Korean Mexican fusion and is amazing), as Chiko is an overpriced overhyped mess.",

You would think I'd get this in a real bowl-style to-go container like you would get elsewhere (like a salad place, Chipotles, Bibibop etc) so you can eat it right out of the bowl. Instead they gave it to me in a carry-out tub that required me to scoop out onto a plate. Sorry, this isn't supposed to be carry-out Chinese here. Heck, even carry-out Chinese at least separates the rice. Very disappointed with these guys.",

This chain employs practice that is questionable at best and unethical at worst  When you pay, you will notice three things. You will pay service/tip BEFORE you receive it. And you pay above market price (max = 25%, min = 18% even for lunch). And if you are a creature of habit, you will hit the 25% option as it is the left most. This is in contrast with typical POS, where left most is the minimum option.  Besides, your portion sizes vary location to location. My chicken wings had 4 in one spot, but 3 in the other. The way the staff dealt with this is why I have point 2.  II. The level of care and professionalism by the server I had was not worth the ask price (18 - 25%)  When confronted with the different portion sizes, my server did not check with the kitchen nor the manager on why. She ventured a guess that maybe there was different in wing sizes, price, etc; however, none of this holds water as I just visited the other location on Thursday of the same week. To make matters worst, she left and brought back a side dish to console us. To her credit, she brought the extra wing after noticing we didn\u2019t touch the side dish.  In all, by all means try the food if you so wish. But I know it is not worth the annoyance I have with my experience.",

Although warned it was spicy, which it was, the cumin lamb stir fry was delicious.  Faced with the dilemma of eating it all or leaving room for dessert, I ordered the pricey,  but worth it, coconut custard.  It got crowded and noisy around noon, so if you want a quiet meal, go for an early (it opens at 11:00 a.m.) or late lunch.  Forks are available upon request.",
