I have to say, those cookies were some of the best I've had of any bakery. The cookies were soft, the ingredients were fresh and they didn't leave us with that \"heavy\" feeling you usually get after treating yourself. I don't want to forget to add that the staff was great.",

The owners are friendly and the restaurant is clean and well-maintained.  Update: Still consistently on our takeout list. We added pierogies to our regular order. Every guest that has eaten here with us has raved about how good it is. It's the kind of place that, were you to move away from Bay Ridge, you would plan a visit just to eat here again. Service and quality have been unwaveringly excellent.",

        "caption": "Very disappointing experience and I've been to Poland many times! I came with my SO on an early Friday evening. The place looked clean but empty and dark (that should have stopped me). After the confirmation from the waiter that the place was opened we took a table and ordered. The food was AT BEST OKAY and I frankly do not understand where all the praise is coming from! But the worst part was the service: we had a male waiter, who seemed to be very unwilling to serve us: no pleasantries or smiles, absent for the most of our time there. When I saw him, I asked to pack our dessert to go, so he just brought a container and left it there staring at me. He also dropped a plastic bag on an oily plate. I HAD TO PACKAGE THE DESSERT MYSELF while he was just standing there and I HAD TO ASK HIM to bring another plastic bag because the one he dropped was already dirty. Who does that?! - Never coming back.",

Being completely along in a place, you would expect server to pay some attention to you, but not here. Every time we needed something, we had to call him. He never cleaned our table or checked on us, no water, no bread, nothing.. he brought a check and even though everywhere online it says that they accept major credit cards, he yelled from the corner that they are cash only when we said that we are paying with the card. He didn't even bother getting up. I will never come back. I don't know how this place has good reviews from others.. Absolutely terrible...",

        "caption": "Along with the Family Store, this is the brightest gem Bay Ridge has to offer.  The food is authentic, high-quality, and top-notch.  Service is great, and the owner is a *very* good looking Polish woman).  I have a fondness for eastern European food in general, and this restaurant definitely satisfies my cravings!  A few small gripes: First, they should mix up the salads a bit because it gets monotonous to eat the same (excellent) 5 salads (beet salad, coleslaw, sauerkraut, red cabbage, carrot salad) each time.  It's cool the first 2 or 3 times, but by your 5th visit here it's tiring.  Maybe they should only give 2 salads and change up which ones you get.   The 2nd gripe: while you're eating, they use Fantastic to clean the table next to yours with no regard about where the spray goes.  It never fails -- I always get Fantastic up my nose and it ruins dinner for a few minutes.  The last gripe is that they don't accept credit cards; but I suspect this is because they don't need to -- the food is so good that they can be cash-only and still turn a healthy profit.  This a restaurant you *must* go to before you die.  If you go only once, I recommend the Ukrainian Borscht and the Stuffed Kielbasa.  Portion size is huge, but mostly because of the salads.  You won't finish your dinner.  Entrees average about $10.  Here's the low down on the food.  Soups: --------- Sauerkraut: A- Surprisingly good (who would think sauerkraut would be good in soup?).  Tomato: B Not really their fault; I'm not a big fan of tomato soup to begin with.  I'm sure it's good.  Vegetable: B- Easily the worst thing on the menu.  Has a metallic taste to it.  Cucumber:            A+ Ukrainian Borscht: A+ Both soups are perfection.   If you order one of these, you will fall in love with it.  Chicken Soup: B- Disappointing.  Watery and not very interesting.  White Borscht: A You get an egg and mashed potatoes with caramelized onions with it.  Red Borscht with Croquet: B+ It'd be good tasting but a tad boring without the croquet (which is a little like chicken kiev).  Red Borscht with Dumplings: B It would be good tasting but a tad boring without the dumplings.  Barley: B- Sounded good.  Unfortunately, a bit bland and lackluster compared to the borschts.  Bean: B+ Very nice flavor.  Spicy, thick, and hearty.  Good for winter.  Appetizers -------------- Mushroom and Potato Pierogi boiled): A- Spinach and Potato (fried): A- Delicious.   I would recommend getting the sampler.  6 homogeneous pierogi is too much; diversity is better here.  Boiled and fried are equally good.  PETER TIP: Ask the waiter for more caramelized onions...they are DELICIOUS and the pierogi are even better with more onions.  Blintzes ----------- Cheese:      A Strawberry: A Blueberry:   A They are perfection in the guise of blintzes.  The Polonica does not serve dessert, but these dishes would definitely fill that void (but good luck wanting dessert after eating so much!)  Other -------- Potato Pancakes: A Potato Cutlet:        A Again, both dishes are perfection.  I think you get 3 or 4 pancakes which are familiar if you've ever had fried latkes for Chanukah.  The Cutlet is like a Godzilla-sized pancake.  Entres --------- Meatballs:        A- Beef Goulash: A Both delicious and masterfully cooked.  The meatballs are a little like salisbury steak.  Pork Chop (Breaded): B A little plain.  Exactly the \"chef's pork chop\" minus the cheese.  Chef's Pork Chop: A- The Pork Chop with cheese; the cheese definitely enhances the dish.  Brizol: B A bit dry.  Boiled Pig Hocks: C- Not their fault.  I'm just not a fan of boiled meat period.  Plus, hocks look a little strange to my Western eyes.  They're feet.  Very fatty and not very flavorful.  I'm sure hock-lovers would like it.  Fried Fish: A It may be sole, but you will NOT be disappointed.  I promise you.  Stuffed Kielbasa: A+ A heart attack waiting to happen, but easily the best thing on the menu.  Boiled Cabbage: A Another perfect meal.  Tasty chopped meat and rice inside well cooked cabbage leaves with a very savory tomato sauce.",
