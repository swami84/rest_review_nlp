I ordered the Sichuan Dumplings, Pow-Tine, and Fried Chicken Fried Rice.  The Pow-Tine arrived safely vented to avoid getting soggy (kudos to the GrubHub driver) and was my favorite of all the dishes. I love this Asian take on poutine. The dumplings did arrive a bit soggy but that's to be expected. If you refry them a little, they crisp up easily. Dumplings were also pretty tasty. The chicken fried rice was interesting. Again, I failed to realize that this would be fake chicken and I'm not really a fan of fake chicken so I wasn't crazy with the texture. But, it was hearty and once I thought of it more like tofu was fine.",

First I will say that the food we were able to order was delicious and the people who worked there were super friendly. Customer service was awesome. But I had a few issues. First, I ordered the Natalie Porkman but they were out of seitan but they switched the chikn for it. Second, I ordered the fried mozzarella but they were out of it and the truck was due the next day. Third, I wanted to try the banana egg roll dessert which I paid for but found out they were out of that too. So, three of the items I wanted to try were not in stock which was very disappointing being that we traveled a long way to try this place and our visit is over tomorrow. They did substitute another menu item for the banana egg roll which was nice. The only reason I would go back is because what we did order was very good and the employees were awesome. I will however call ahead to see if they are fully stocked. Otherwise I will not go out of my way.  Update: Customer service goes a long way in my book. I appreciate the fact that this is a small business and they make everything  in house. That's why I wanted to try it all! Because they were so awesome and because they took the time to reply to this review and because the food I did get was delicious....I will be back when I am in DC. Save a chimi chimi pow pow egg roll and some Taiwanese fried mozzarella for me please \ud83d\ude01",

I've never had fries like the trolley fries before -- topped with kimchi and a mayo sauce and dried seaweed. It sounds quirky but all the flavors work so well together. But they're most famous for their giant egg roll, which is as thick as an arm and exactly the kind of greasy food you're craving when you order an egg roll. It's listed as a starter but it's really a whole meal.  The General's Chicken imitates the original so well, but my favorite entree is the Natalie Porkman, and not just for the bad pun. It's crispy and crunchy like fried chicken should be, with just enough sweet & sour sauce. And the Taiwanese fried cheese balls are as decadent as they sound. They also usually have a few rotating specials.  Basically, I've never had anything bad here. I'm sure if Pow Pow were located somewhere more central, it'd have an even bigger cult following. In the meantime, it's becoming my go-go delivery spot.",

The Yoda Bowl is loaded with veggies with crunchy sriracha cashews that adds a nice kick, hearty grilled chicken mock meat coated in savory peanut sauce, and drizzle of creamy zesty cucumber lime sauce. Although I appreciate the variety of ingredients, the tomatoes and carrots didn't blend well together with black beans, edamame and the rice quinoa mix. I think mushrooms, broccoli, or corn would have been a better pairing. There's a seasonal bowl similar to the Yoda bowl, but with sweet potato instead of the mock meat, which I would try next time!  My meat-loving husband loved the crispy fried fingers smothered in sauce. I got 1/2 with the traditional firecracker sauce which is like a tangy buffalo sauce and other 1/2 with teriyaki sauce. I honestly couldn't taste the difference between the sauces. The only difference I could taste were the plain vs black sesame seeds. I enjoyed the sesame sauce. As the fried mock meat was doused in sauce, it had a very bold flavor that overpowered the Yoda Bowl. I love wings coated in sauce, but not to the point that the wings are swimming in sauce and leave little puddles as I pick them up. I recommend getting the sauce on the side.  I wasn't a fan of the Trolley Fries. I wanted to love the fries as they were loaded with my favorite ingredients (sriracha mayo, kimichi, scallians, ketchup), but the fries weren't crispy and lukewarm. Also the toppings were a bit of overload and sadly I ended up tossing out the entire tray of fries after a few bites.  Plenty of great choices and fun to try. Save your appetite for the Yoda Bowl!",

The main part of each dish, such as the mock meats and mozzarella balls, are quite delicious and have lovely sauces. However, they only use a tiny amount of sauce, not nearly enough for the dish. The vegetables are VERY bland to the point where they may even be unseasoned. I had to make a sauce at home to make half of the meal edible. And this is coming from someone whose diet consists of 80-90% vegetables!",

The chicken texture was fantastic, crunchy outside and tender flaky inside. The sauce was the perfect amount and really good. Served on citrusy greens and coconut rice/quinoa, decorated with a line of sesame seeds and plated very beautifully in a biodegradable container. I also had to try the trolly fries. Sooo good! While you won't find any meat in their dishes, I don't think you'll really notice. They far surpassed my expectations for fast casual Asian food.",

My friend ordered the Wu Banger, which she wasn't a fan of at all, moreso due to the sauce. It was also very warm on the inside of the restaurant, which may have helped to attract the bugs flying around us as we're eating. The prices seemed adequate for the portion sizes. We had high hopes for this spot, but we will probably never visit again. The staff we're friendly and the restaurant was clean. Just and FYI there is NO SUSHI being served here, even though it was in the category of Sushi Restaurants when we looked into the spot to begin with!! You be the judge!!",

It did not sit well, me and my S/O felt flu sick as it felt like it sat in our throats and as soon as the 2nd bite hit my taste buds my tongue curled, a bad sour with a hint of how a horse stable smells. As a vegan this disheartens me horribly personally, we were looking forward to coming here for almost 2 weeks!.. Maybe it was just what I got the \"Tokyo Roboto\", It was so bland, the rice was gritty, and the pineapples had no apparent flavor but a greasy grilled taste. Also my boyfriend got The General's Chicken and unlike me he LOVES spicy but it was just too much, like it canceled all the flavor the bowl looked like it had to offer.. So take my review with a grain of salt, maybe it was just a bad day for the employees, short end of the straw for us ingredient wise. But 10/10 NOT worth the price because we weren't even able to stomach our whole bowls, leaving a wasteful total of 1 out of our 2 bowls in left overs...",

Majority of the places (vegan) my boyfriend and I have been to, have been really expensive. Pow Pow is a restaurant we've come across a couple of times but never explored it. Today, Sunday June 24, we decided to come in. I ordered \"The General's Chicken\" and my boyfriend ordered the \"Tokyo Roboto\". Immediately the flavors were bursting intensively, my bowl was sweet and spicy, while my boyfriend's was exceptional. Alas  that quickly changed  I noticed with our service our food sat out(before being transferred to a tray) before being called, and oddly enough our food quickly grew cold  but I had cold spots in my food, my broccoli was bland, and tasted frozen as if they bought it at the giant down the street. The rice was gritty and distasteful, I had a couple scallions in my bowl which tasted a little over cooked. I can handle spicy food, I seek after spicy dishes, so I'm not sure what is churning in my stomach. My boyfriend and I felt sick after our meal, he quickly moved to the restaurant bathroom, and I'm having pains. I can see good intentions in this small shop. For me, I'd really like to test the dessert but I'm too afraid to chance $5 on another dish here. I may return for the \"Chicken Fingers\", and \"Taiwanese Friend Mozzarella\" but until then I won't be recommending this place to anyone curious enough to try this restaurant.",

Not sure what type of Asian inspired food they were serving but pictures online looked enticing and prices were only $9 to $10 bucks.  I started with the Trolley Fries with Pulled Pork (fries with kimchi, cheddar, Korean ketchup, spicy mayo, cilantro). Oh my! I didn't expect this to be a meal in itself but it sure was heavenly. I simply couldn't resist the perfectly crisp fries, melted cheese topped with juicy pulled pork. At this point, I was already full but I decided to order a bowl. Might as well cause I was only in town for the weekend anyway :)  I got the Yoga Dragon bowl (mock fried chicken in peanut sauce, black beans, veggies, spicy nut crumbles drizzled with cucumber-lime & sriracha sauce). I only had a few bites but it was very tasty. I took the rest home and ate it the following day and it was still pretty yummy. This place is a great option for fresh made to order lunch other than typical fast food chain without breaking the bank.",

        "caption": "I had heard through the grapevine that Chef Jarobi White was coming through this restaurant, and I took it upon myself to make the hike from the MD burbs to go see him.  H St is mostly unexplored territory for me.  Not only is it 1.5 miles from the two closest metro stations, but somehow the locals are always heavily populating the strip of bars and restaurants, so parking can be a pain as well.  In this case, I was lucky enough to get a ride.  I arrived about 15 minutes after the official event began, and I was a bit surprised.  It was a rather small restaurant... could maybe fit 20-30 people max to be seated comfortably.  Even so, I walked up to the big menu so I could figure out what I was going to get.  Some of the choices looked really interesting, and I love that they had something with \"Midnight Marauders\" in the name.  They also had an egg roll with banana and nutella... I was beyond tempted to get that, but I needed something healthier.  I was going to get the Purity Bowl, but then I saw that they had \"Jarobi specials\" since he was coming through.  I decided that they wouldn't be around again, so I got the \"Beets, Honey and Rice\" bowl.  It had pickled onions, beet drizzle, Taiwanese fried honey chicken, and some other things in it.  I was surprised at how filling it was!  My chicken was real, but I saw that they have several vegetarian and vegan options.  I really enjoyed myself at this spot.  I got to meet Jarobi, take a picture with him, vibe to a lot of old school hip-hop, and just chill.  I absolutely have to take my sister... maybe I can make her drive, haha.",

There are also very good vegetarian options.  My only complaint is that the service can occasionally be disorganized, ie, they may get part of your order wrong.",

I dinged it a little bit with 4 stars because I wanted a beer and they didn't have any alcohol yet. The people working there were great people as were the owners. Price was very competitive for what you got. Would recommend this place highly and intend to go back with my wife.",

I feel like this place has potential after having the trolley fries - I am just not super excited to try the rest of the menu after ordering a few of the swords and having them be pretty underwhelming for how much they cost.",

We have Buredo serving burrito sized sushi (I still can't bring myself to do it) and now we have burrito sized egg/spring rolls thanks to our newest neighbor on H Street NE, Pow Pow.  My Monday night dinner buddy and I were skeptical when we saw their menu- three burrito sized egg rolls and salads. What if we didn't like anything on the menu? We had to take the risk.  My buddy ordered the Purity Bowl and he LOVED it. He's a chef on the side and thinks most things are just \"meh\" so when he loves something, you know it's top notch. I ordered the Midnight Marauder, a burrito sized egg roll filled with steak, cheddar, onion kimchi, and napa cabbage. It was simple, but AMAZING! It comes with chipotle mayo (ask for seconds of that- you'll need it!) and it really brought out the flavors. It comes in two healthy portions and it's not overly greasy like other egg rolls and it filled me up as a whole meal! Wow. I will crave the Midnight Marauder.  The restaurant is right off the tram line in the middle of H Street NE. It's set up like a fast casual restaurant going through a line and picking from both booth and window seating.  The only things that prevented it from getting a five star review was the service. Even though it's a fast casual restaurant, it took 20 minutes for us to get our food. Also, the soda is $4 so ask for a cup for water (It's free!).",
