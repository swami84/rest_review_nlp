I'm told by the person making the reservation that her ID and credit card info was held with the hostess for the entire visit.  Drinks and food served quickly.  Cocktail and drink list are extensive and food selections were varied but more limited, typical pub food. Staff was mindful, friendly and efficient. I feel we got what we paid for.  I'd visit again.",

It has a nice view over the city of Chicago and great drinks and food to enjoy except for the rush vibes you get from the service. The thing that ruined our experience was when we went to the edge of the rooftop balcony to take some photos the busboys came to our table and cleared everything away, we were about 10feet apart from our table and we had drinks and food at our table and we also had two more drinks ordered from the waiter. So when we came back our table was completely empty. That\u2019s why I would never come back here again",

It took our server 30 min to come and take our order after our full party arrived (mind you, we are on a time limit and we are stuck in an igloo, not that easy to go and get her). The food was cold and terrible. She didn\u2019t write our order down so of course some of our orders were wrong and she forgot some of our drinks. She was clearly having a bad day and made it very clear she did not want to work there.  At the end of the night when we asked her to split the bill 3 ways, she got REALLY upset and walked out of the igloo and left the door unzipped purposely.  This was the worst service we\u2019ve ever had. They didn\u2019t even offer a slight discount for the inconvenience. What a joke!!!",

The zipper on the igloo failed to work for the first 20-25 min of our time line with no adjustment for the inconvenience of freezing during this time while the mntce people worked on the zipper. Every simple thing we asked for like (a) chair for a person who had no seat (b) sauce for fries (c) straws- had to be asked repeatedly. We finally went and got a chair on our own so that the 6th person could actually sit down. All of our fries were too cold to eat when they finally brought the aioli which is why we even ordered them. The attitude of the hostess and our waitress was not nice and extremely pushy. The food was excellent which is why I added an extra star. I accidentally left my scarf and told my friend when I asked her to collect it for me since she stayed overnight there. They told her no scarf was left. I left from my hotel elsewhere to go back there to demand they bring me my scarf which I know is there. They literally brought it out in less than 3 minutes. Extremely poor experience and overpriced for such poor service. Go elsewhere.",

I went in today to get clarifications on the amount that I was charged for the Winterland Igloo deposit and was met with the Manager, Ashley, who provided poor, dismissive customer service.  On a beautiful Saturday afternoon a friend and I went to I/O during Brunch hours, we noticed the Mimosas kit on the brunch menu $50.  Our server, Rachel informed us that we could switch the deposit wine ($225) for mimosas and there would be a credit to the bill. Ok, sounds perfect.  Unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding, we would not be getting the Mimosa kit on the brunch menu but a higher priced champagne from the drink menu which was not explained at the time of ordering, a simple misunderstanding.  When going to speak with the Manager about the charge of the wine ($225) vs. the Mimosas  that were ordered, Ashley was kind enough to get a copy of my receipt but that's when the customer service ended. I attempted to explain what I was informed during our dining experience and tried to understand how the Mimosa kit turned into a $200 charge with no Mimosas on my receipt.  I was cut off multiple times, Ashley stated, \"We don't need to explain it to you, it's written everywhere?\" At this time, I'm trying to understand the charges, receipt and brunch menu, I ask Ashley, \"Do you understand what I trying to say? \" She replies, \"No, I don't, because you're not making sense.\"  At what point in customer service do you tell a customer that they're not making sense when they're seeking to understand?  In short, my $225 wine deposit was switched for the $200 champagne. I do not mind paying for any experience or services rendered, the beignets, Benedicts, sliders, lamb chops and sweet potatoe skillet were great, however,  if I have questions or need clarity, I expect to be met with someone who's attempting to understand  my concerns and not be dismissive. There are so many tactful ways to handle customers and this definitely is not one of them.  Customer Service",

Food and drinks were prompt, and we were checked on very frequently by patient and enthusiastic waitresses and hosts. And the food was incredible, try the lamb lolichops and the salmon, cooked to perfection, and the steak tacos were amazing for appetizers.

When the waiter came out and asked  did the table have any allergies, I responded a dairy allergy to which the waiter scoffed. Already jaded by the experience thus far, the waiter let us know that they had no tap water only Fiji. Once we decided this location was not the choice, we left $10 on the table to cover the water because we couldn\u2019t find our server. At this point, we were followed out to the server\u2019s desk because the water was $11.48. Instead of inquiring about the experience, we were tracked for $1.50.

He was able to move us in a shaded area under an umbrella & we felt comfortable since their were no other patrons around us. 100% the best experience for us who were nervous about going out during COVID. I suggest requesting Dalton as your server for he is kind, friendly & very helpful...also gives great recommendations on the good eats. This is one of our favorite places & will be back. Thank you Dalton for making my son's 13th birthday brunch a very nice experience! Would give 10 stars!",

We get there to have them seat us at the BAR right next to the tubes for the beer pumps for God's sake.  Are you kidding me?  We asked to be seated at a nice L shaped sofa like several two person couples were or just a table not the bar and we were told that was our only option or we could sit in two chairs with a small end table between us.  We asked to speak with a manager, no one came out.  The same hostess who kept repeating that other tables were for parties with more people came back and then told us we could sit at a six person counter height table now.  They were not willing to give us a smaller more intimate table or sofa but I guess we could have a six person counter height table?  Another employee comes out and begins to argue with us and tell us that the bar is considered a table and that's just the way it is.  Needless to say we left.  No thanks.  Super rude and just wanted to stick us anywhere to fill up space.  Ashley the manager who booked the reservation never once mentioned yeah we're gonna stick you at the bar for your 20 year anniversary dinner.  Stay away!",

On Saturday night we thought to give the I|O bar a try and the customer service was terrible. We took the elevator down to the 4th floor and were told that we had to go to the lobby for wrist bands even though we are staying on the premises. We venture down just to show our IDs then ushered to the elevator to come back to the 4th floor and when we walked back into the bar no one checked our bands. We proceeded to the bar and bought two drinks from a bartender that obviously can't speak more than 7 words, \"You wanna open or close your tab\". After standing we notice tons of tables so we asked one of the bar girls where can we sit to not interrupt reserved seating, she pointed to a section and before we could sit down the hostess both said we couldn't  sit there. We advised that the bar girl said we could and they told us we can sit anywhere else. We then walked to the opposite side of the bar and sat down in a booth in the back (mind you there were 7 or more tables available). One hostess rushed over to say we couldn't sit there. We then asked where we CAN sit to enjoy our beverage and she said no where. She didn't ask if we wanted the bottle service.., she just assumed we couldn't pay for it. Coming here after spending $400 at Chicago Cut was disheartening. We hold all corporations at a high standard. Our next visit to the Windy City we'll be choosing a different hotel. If I could choose ZERO stars I would however the option was unavailable.",

There were no large tables that we can all sit for 16 people but manage to sit in the couch area with additional stools.  The menu had some unique mixed drinks like the watermelon margarita and the dragonfruit mojito which was a delight to drink with the gorgeous roof-top view of the city. The service was impeccable and what we ordered for food and drinks came fast.  So why the bad marks, well I went to the washroom to freshen up and to my surprise I was stopped by the hostess and asked me where I was going? I mention I am sitting there as I pointed to the large booth and then he told me to take off my cap, which I was wearing that as I came here a few hours ago.  I asked if there is a dress code and he told me yes, it started at 8pm. Dress code posted is \"wear smart and casual - elegant attire\".  All I ask if there is a dress code, tell me before I enter not after spending hours there.  I guess I will think twice to recommend this place for drinks or come here before 8pm.",

When one more friend showed up he demanded another 55 dollars and made me give him my license which he held until I came back with money. I spent well in excess of 1000 dollars on that table and it ruined my birthday that this type of extortion happened. I came to visit from NYC to this place with close friends. It's sad that it culminated with this experience. I hope the manager reads this and addresses this. I am happy to give details of my bottle reservation as well. Waitress was fantastic btw.",

The bartenders were really cool but the drinks are a little bit on the pricey side. I'm from Miami so I'm used to it but if you're used to 8$and $9 drinks this is not the place. I didn't get a chance to try the food but I saw some plates come out that looked very delicious. The decor is very chic and so was the crowd. There was a doorman downstairs but he didn't give me any problems coming in. I was dressed in a suit which I thought was appropriate for the environment.

An experience like no other, when we got our food and noticed our lamb chops didnt arrive and finally asked she stated, \"oh it's not on brunch menu\" when it clearly was and then 20 min later was passively told we couldn't be there longer than 2hrs, RUDE.

I sat with 2 doctors at a table I have sat at many times before and was certain to make sure there was no reserved sign.  Kayla, the most unprofessional hostess I have ever met came over and demanded we leave the table that we were being served at.  The place was a desert as it is a has been rooftop and there were plenty of tables open.  She got beyond nasty and even though I told her I had a foot injury still demanded we leave the table.  I contacted the GM Ashley Kelly multiple times to report the incident but she is just as incompetent as her staff and hence a reflection of the poorly ran place I once loved.  She never returned my call.  There is enough competition in the rooftop space now, do not waste your time and money here as I no longer will.",

I came here with a group of friends and family to celebrate my 21st birthday on 2/16/19, and I was completely embarrassed and disgusted with how we were treated at the door. Prior to arriving, I spoke with two people that worked there. During the first conversation, I was inquiring about table reservations, and I was given the price points of the bottle services. However, at no point in that was it stated that large groups HAD to reserve a table with bottle service. On another occasion I spoke to Ashley Kelly, the general manager. I asked her if there was any list we needed to get added to to ensure entrance, she said no. So you can understand my confusion when we arrive and BRAD, the door manager tells us we cannot enter without a table reservation. From the very beginning BRAD was rude and unwelcoming. He stated that because we were a large group we had to reserve a table to ensure we wouldn't congregate in one area, and when I asked where this policy came from, seeing as though it was never explained in either of my previous conversation with IO employees; he stated that it was on the website (my entire group checked the website, it is not stated on there) and it has always been their policy. So after continuous questioning about this phantom policy, BRAD slips and says that this rule is not only to ensure we don't congregate but to ensure that large groups spend a certain amount of money. So not only is there no room in a lounge for a large group, now we are also being turned around because he is assuming we won't spend any money. As if this isn't bad enough, as I'm speaking with BRAD, the door manager a group of 10 plus (that does not have a table reservation), enter. To everyone's surprise, they are allowed in. So when we see them entering, I ask BRAD why they are being allowed in since they also do not have a reservation. His reasoning was that they know one of the bartenders. So I asked how does he know that they won't congregate or spend a lot of money, being as though these were the reasons why we wouldn't be let in. He says that \"there is an exception to every rule.\" So is the problem that we will congregate or is it that we won't spend enough money? Or is the problem that we don't know the right people? Or is it that we didn't fit the image of BRAD's ideal patron? Whatever his reasoning is, it is complete nonsense and made up in his tiny brain. I will never return to this DISGUSTING establishment.",

Before even coming to the lounge the bday girl was in contact with a manager to ensure there would not be any issues with our group coming to the lounge without any table reservations. Of course when we got there it was a different story. We were turned away by Brad (who introduced himself as the door manager). He told us we could not come in because we were a large group and we might not spend money without a table reservation It was extremely disheartening to be treated in such a horrible manner. For Brad (door manager) to assume we were not going to spend money is insulting and all of the lies he told was very frustrating. We were celebrating a birthday...why wouldn't we go and have a great time and spend money!!. I WILL NEVER go here again and I will definitely spread the word. Poor poor customer service. And to add insult to injury BRAD proceeded to allow a large group (who did not have table reservations...we asked them) to go up without any trouble. Please beware of how this business treats their customers. Do not go here. Especially if you are African American...they will treat you less than!!!",

My family and friends were at Godfrey this past Saturday 2/16/19, for my Goddaughters 21st birthday. The moment we walked in the door, Brad the \"Door Manager\" said we were not able to enter the rooftop lounge because we were a big group. The birthday girl communitacted with a manger at Godfrey and was not told that if she was to have her group join them on Saturday without an reservations, we would be denied entry. I never been denied entry into an lounge or bar when being with 10 or more family and friends, but Brad made the decision not to let us in. He couldn't provide roof of the \"policy\", he said it's on the website and the site does not state big groups are not allowed without reservations, but then allowed a group of 10 people who happened to be caucasian without reservations right in front of us. I asked if they had servations and they said NO. Again Brad still decided not to let us in. I told my Goddaughter not to worry about it, when you are treated this way, you do not give an establishment your money, nor continue try to understand what the issue is, cause you will never get it. I found may other establishments area the area, who I knew would except us and we went to Sound Bar and had a GREAT TIME, my Godaughter, family and friends had an Amazing time at Sound Bar. She enjoyed her 21st Birthday and that's all we all wanted for her. GODFREY GETS NO STARS FROM ME AND TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BRAD REPRESENT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT, WHO DENYS SOMEONE TO ENJOY AN EVENING WHERE SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SPEND HER 21ST BIRTHDAY OR ANY CELEBRATION IS WRONG. WHEN DID IT GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU ARE NOT ALLOW TO ENJOY MUSIC, FOOD AND DRINKS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO? THANKS TO BRAD, I WOULD NO LONGER COME TO GODFREY.

Me and a group of friends and family came here to celebrate a 21st birthday. Before even coming, I emailed a woman named Kayla, who is a hostess at the IO Godfrey. I asked her if there was any kind of list we needed to be on because there was a group. She told me no, but people with table reservations would be seated first. That's understood!! Then, the manager Ashley emailed the birthday girl of our group and told her there is no list, we would be able to come, but it would be standing room only. Ok, that's understood again. As soon as we walk in, they have the door manager BRAD, who was extremely rude from the very beginning, who basically wouldn't let us in because we were a \"large\" group. He said it was policy and on the website, which was his first lie, because I have yet to find the policy and he couldn't even show us. Then, said the space isn't made for large groups to congregate. BUT if we wanted to pay for a table then we could go up and congregate. So you're telling me your establishment is not made for big groups, but if we buy a table you can accommodate a big group? Hmmmm how stupid does that sound? Now you're lying to me again, BRAD. Then, he said they can't just have us all standing around congregating. I'm sorry, what difference would it make if we all came in pairs of two or four once we were in the lounge, we still would have been socializing together because IT'S A LOUNGE AND PEOPLE SOCIALIZE!!! Then BRAD makes a statement about people not buying drinks. Now we're getting somewhere, BRAD!!! I completely understand it's about money, but for you to automatically assume that because we are a group and we didn't pay for a table, which we didn't want anyway, that we would go up and not buy drinks is extremely insulting. You know what they say about assuming! Like we seriously were here to celebrate a birthday. What would make you think we weren't going to buy drinks? So, next we asked for the manager Ashley, just to get clarification and BRAD said she was upstairs and didn't want to come down. Not understanding, if she's a manager why wouldn't she come down? That's bad business and customer service on her part. THEN TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE.... as we are standing trying to understand BRAD's logic, he literally let a whole GROUP of 10 people, who I will state were all Caucasian, in to go up right in front of us and guess what?!?! They didn't have table reservations, because we made sure to ask them as they all were filing in line.  But since they knew somebody there, they were allowed to go up. Hmmm now, there is a bigger problem. Oh and interesting enough someone in our party was actually texting Ashley about what was going on, and she stated that she wasn't even on the premises. Hmmmm so who is lying and what is the reason for lying? This is my second time having an issue with this establishment and the last. Not wanting to make this a racial issue, but it clearly is and in 2019, people will not tolerate the disrespect. Our group gladly took our money to Sound Bar Night Club and the birthday girl had an amazing 21st birthday. That was your final time, IO Godfrey, and I will make sure to make others aware of how you treat people who just want to come and have a good time like everyone else!",

Last night, I and a group of friends decided to enjoy a friend\u2019s 21st birthday at this location. Prior to this night, my friend spoke with the manager regarding her party attending. At that time, she was told the price of bottle service. It was never explained that bottle service was required for a certain size party. So last night, the birthday girl and twelve others arrive, at the same time, to go celebrate. At this time, we were stopped and told that in order to get in, we needed to purchase a table and bottle service (something  that was never mentioned during that previous call). We were also told that it is on the website (never found it). The reason given? They don\u2019t want such a large group congregating in one spot. Is it not a social event? Everyone is congregating, but I digress. Now, this would have simply been an issue of slime balls trying to get money UNTIL less than five minutes later, a just about equal, maybe even larger, sized group of Caucasian people (no disrespect to them), male and female, were allowed to go up without bottle service or a table. The justification? \u201cThey know a bartender up there.\u201d So, us \u201ccongregating\u201d would have been allowed if we knew one person who worked up there? Sure. Needless to say, individual parties in our group reached out to the manager same manager from the previous call. She refused to come down and speak with anyone. I don\u2019t want to make this a racial issue, but again, this is my third time dealing with these phantom rules that came out of the sky upon my arrival. Another individual in the party and friends (group of four this time) were turned away because her name was not on a list. Mind you, when she called prior to the night, a list was never mentioned. I won\u2019t get into the details of the third incident, but just to be clear, it was centered around the same imagination station policy. This is embarrassing and disgusting. I am extremely disappointed and refuse to allow them to humiliate me again. But before I ban them from my life, I will share my experience and make others aware of this establishment\u2019s hypocrisy.",

I have yet to receive any emails back, which leads me to believe that management condones such behavior. I notice other people have encountered similar experiences as well. It's about to be 2019, so if you are trying to have a good time go somewhere else. The drinks are overpriced and the food is not satisfying. The bartenders are rude. Its time to get rid of all of the hate in the world and support establishments that promote equality. Also, if you have experienced any form of discrimination, please email me directly. I will be reaching out to different news outlets. I went to the Godfrey, and the guy that disrespected me is still there. Join me on my journey.",

When I walked into the hotel, at 2:00 am a Caucasian male with glasses stated, reservation? I said, I do not have a reservation, but I am with a group of people. My friend walked passed and walked right in. She commented and said she is with me. He then stated \"how many of \"you\" people are there\"? She stated not that many. He went on to say ok because we do not accept large reservations. I asked my friends did the bouncer ask if they had a reservation? They stated, no. The bouncer made me feel like if I did not have a reservation than I could not get in. I got a racist vibe from the bouncer. He made me feel uncomfortable as a African American woman during our brief encounter. I will not be going to Godfrey anymore, and I will definitely relay the message to my friends in the Chicago Film Industry.",

Sasha was extremely rude and did not seem very comfortable or knowledgeable with her position as a hostess. My friend and I waited for someone to greet us, for over 20 minutes before we actually decided to seek assistance with ordering. Sasha told us that the area was closed however there were people sitting there that had just ordered. She then stated no one would come to our table which was literally steps away from customers who had just arrived as well. She then instructed us to move to a closer table and walked away.  There was nothing indicating the section was closed. We sat while waiters walked by and not say a word. Completely unnaceptable. Instead of arguing with soemone who seemed to not understand the importance of true hospitality, we  simply walked away and went to ZED 451.  I urge the managers to enforce the significance of professionalism and hospitality to Sasha before you lose other customers.",

Drinks were excellent, the view was stunning, and the atmosphere was comfortable. Our server, alexis, was inattentive and rude. My group was a group of six young adults, which i know some servers are discouraged by but it was no excuse. Alexis spoke with us maybe two or three times, our drinks arrived and she didnt even stop by to see how they were although we had questions about the margarita being pink(which was grapefruit flavored and delish btw) as we have a few fruit allergies in the group. Also, it was my best friends 21st birthday and i tried to catch her attention discretely so i could lock down the payment and ask about any birthday specials, she completely ignored me and avoided our table. Upon dropping off the check we realized she added a 21% automatic gratuity. First of all, every single one of us is in the service industry and would have loved to tip her more than healthily. Working in a downtown cocktail lounge myself i would have been ashamed to send any guest away after that. A place like this is more about the experience than just the drinks alone. I hope the other servers around here arent as judgemental and will give the benefit of the doubt to anyone despite age.",
