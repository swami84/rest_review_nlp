The green sauce which was a little spicy was very good however and saved the flavor of the chicken. The rice was also decent but overall nothing to write home about. Could be that there are other better dishes but Chicken Tandoori seems to be a well-known dish and I was not feeling it.",

I have been living in this neighborhood for 20+ years, and had been going to the same Indian restaurant over and over again. Although my local place was great, I was looking for more of a change and I thought Bombay Grill would be the place that I could go to for a great culinary experience. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We arrived at the restaurant and ordered a Malai Kofta, Saag Paneer and naan. We were first served 3 chutneys and papad. All of the chutneys were sweet, not appealing for my taste. We waited for our food for about 15 minutes, not long at all. We were then served with warm, but not hot, dishes and very, very small portion sizes of food. However, the appearance of the food was good. We started eating the Malai Kofta first. This was probably the least appetizing dish we had at the restaurant because the gravy, like the chutneys, was sweet, even though we ordered for all dishes to be medium spicy. The main problem with the dish was that the koftas were really dry, and tasted like unseasoned and grainy falafel like balls. They had no vegetables in them, as described in the menu, and were not tasty. The Saag Paneer, though sweet like everything else, was good and appetizing. The naans were great, however, in the menu they were said to cost $1.95, but they actually charged us $2.95 per naan. My main two concerns with Bombay Grill were the portion sizes and the sweetness of the food. The North Indian dishes that we ordered were too sweet considering that I ordered for spicy food, and did not taste like traditional Indian dishes. The portion sizes were too small and you would have to order 2 veggie dishes in order to feed one person, and each dish was for the price of a large dish compared to other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood. In spite of all this, the environment was great and clean. Overall, I was not happy with the whole experience.",

I had ordered for a chicken curry dish and the chicken pieces were uncooked. I called them up to give this feedback but they were just not accepting, and insisting that the chicken is cooked. A simple question regarding what exactly went wrong would've gone a much farther way rather than being in complete denial. Garlic Naan was literally a plain Naan with some garlic chutney sprinkled on top.  So to add to the bad food quality, there was also bad ethics involved in not even willing to listen to a feedback regarding their product. The manager was hell-bent on believing I was trying to get a refund / replacement out of him. Please avoid it if you know what true Indian food taste is and don\u2019t want to waste your money on a scam place pretending to be authentic. Way better Indian places in Bay Ridge than this one.",

I've been eating here for the last 5 years and the food is always excellent. I cannot recall a single occasion when it was anything less than what I had come to expect. My favorite dishes are the Samosa, Chana puri, chicken biryani, saag paneer.  As a bonus you get a small complimentary rice pudding at the end of your meal.",

Chicken Kashmiri tasted not fresh at all and chicken tandoori was burnt and the Keema naan was without Keema (minced meat). Naan was so under cooked that I felt, I am eating raw flour. On top of the worst food and low grade service, the management of this place is an absolute nightmare. I asked the manager for a duplicate receipt for expense purposes and he said that his manager will take money out of his pocket for printing another receipt. I asked him to let me speak with the manager and then he said that he is the manager and the owner. Lying people with the worst service, bad attitude and worst food. I have tried Indian food from many many restaurants but this was the worst experience, period. I got really sick after eating there and had to take a day off from work the next day. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL",

The lamb is excellent and the offerings are very tasty and authentic.  For those of you looking to imbibe, do it elsewhere. The wine selection feels like it was randomly gifted to them rather than procured; one would be better off drinking from the selection of juices.  Come here for very good Indian food and be sure to try the saag paneer, garlic naan, and the lamb shank if you're feeling adventurous.",

The preparation time was quick and seamless! Moreover, we asked to take our left overs to go, and being the klutzes that we are, we forgot them at the place. Our waiter personally chased us down on a bicycle and hand-delivered our forgotten food. What a kind soul! His devotion truly epitomized the vibe of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place, and can honestly say that my friend and I will be returning.",

Chicken Pakoda is kind of funny. They fried the chicken with besan coating on top of it. But chicken piece tastes okay. In Chicken Biriyani, chicken pieces are nice. But the flavor is kind of schezwan and ghee. They gave complementary papads in the beginning and mango rice pudding in the end. Overall complementary food  tastes good than ordered one. If you would like to go then try to taste the onion & tomato salsa on the table with complementary papads. Items are indian and recipe is kind of strange.",
