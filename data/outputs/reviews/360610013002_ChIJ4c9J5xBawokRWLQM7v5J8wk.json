They're charging $1.33 per slice for the most pathetic bacon I've ever been served!  We also ordered a classic waffle and a gluten-free waffle. Neither were good. The classic waffle is so hard it tore up my gums after eating only one quarter if it. The gluten-free waffle was actually better than the regular, but there was just no flavor. And both were super dry. Even our Mocha smoothie is pretty flavorless! I had to take a bite of something else just to check that I don't have covid or something!  The chai is nice, however. Lightly sweet, which is perfect for us. And the banana bread has great flavor, and is spiced so nicely. But also really, really dry.  We definitely won't be ordering here again, which is so disappointing. It's hard to find healthy, gluten-free free food that also tastes good. And I guess we're still on the hunt!",

I ordered online yesterday for pick up and mentioned that I am pregnant and cannot have the goat cheese.  One of the associates working there called me directly to say she also had children and can assure me the goat cheese is made from pasteurized milk and is safe to eat.  I thought this was so nice of her to take that step, she went above and beyond.  And the avocado toast (and tomato toast) is SOOO great.  The mashed avocado is superb with peas and microgreens and the creamy goat cheese and they give a slice of lemon for a dash of acidity...and it's the perfect size and fills you up...I highly recommend this place, the staff is so friendly and the place is modern and clean.

The downside was the staff were not at all engaging and basically monosyllabic; maybe because the place was roasting hot (I assume the aircon was not working). In their defence they were also overstretched because there were only three of them in total, which just wasn\u2019t enough. We saw plenty of mixed up orders and customers chasing forgotten orders.

Also tried the avocado toast with a poached egg (pretty pricey at $17, but I guess that's par for the course these days).  Food came out before the coffee (even though there were only 2 drinks ahead of me)...so maybe not the place to swing by if you're in a hurry for your coffee. Stopped in on a weekday around 10AM and plenty of spots to grab a table.  Music was a bit loud, but I was just there to get some work done, so that was fine.  Will be back!",

We'll not be back - mainly due to the bad attitude of the one staff member. A smile would make all the difference - no need to stand with crossed arms looking miserable at customers.

I needed something to wake me up - and the coffee here tasted more like water, or milk really, than anything else. Nice space inside and kind baristas, but the service was too slow. I had to wait more than five minutes to get my flat white and there was only one couple ahead of me. I'm looking for a coffee shop to frequent daily in the area. This won't be it.",

You order at the counter and the staffs seems like they don't care.  I asked for scrambled eggs and they gave me fried eggs.  They forgot strawberries and when I asked about it, one of the staff gave me an annoyed look.  Ended up with one strawberry, sliced into 4 pieces...  Not worth the price.

Upon hearing the barista's recommendations, I ended up with the matcha green tea latte with hemp milk (it's sweeter and tastier than soy milk, who knew!) and the avocado smash toast with lemon and vegemite.

I walked out healthier, a little bit more knowledgeable of healthy alternatives, and most importantly with a very satisfied appetite.",
