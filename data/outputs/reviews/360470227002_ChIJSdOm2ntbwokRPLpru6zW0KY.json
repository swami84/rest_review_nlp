The moist brisket is a fantastic standout and the smoked cheese grits are amazing. Pulled pork, potato salad, cole slaw, elotes, and Caesar salad all are super solid, and the accompaniments like their spicy/sweet  sauce and pickled jalape\u00f1os are generous and tasty. We look forward to our next delivery!",

Still no food at 6:00 PM so I call the number listed, which is not the restaurant\u2019s number. Next I try following the link from the confirmation to be told that my order was cancelled, with no notification. Now my wife and I are hungry and my credit card has been charged. No Thanks. Update: The owner did call me back and take credit for the error but it was too little too late at that point. Maybe I\u2019ll get to try it one day.",

        "caption": "Loved this place (or really delivery) We tried the Cesar (nice tangy dressing that went well with the richness of the meat), the light and fresh slaw was perfect as were the creamy & spicy elotes. Tried both the lean and fatty brisket and both were great and I loved the BBQ sauce (although that was ALOT of sauce - we froze 2/3 of it for later use).  The only not 100% great was the chicken, a bit smokier than I would prefer but we shredded it and made tacos with the leftover slaw and pickled veg- so the leftovers just kept giving.  Also firm respect to the owners who personally  emailed the next day asking for feedback. Looking forward to checking out the pork next time.",

Having never ordered from them before we worried about portion size (you gotta have leftovers!!) but when they said feast they weren\u2019t lying! Everything was delicious and there was definitely enough for six or like 10. I\u2019ll dream about the greens and Mac n cheese for the rest of my life \u2014 the biggest surprise was how much this turkey hater now LOVES smoked turkey. Who knew?! Will most definitely trust them with more holidays (and regular days) in the future!",

Mashed potatoes with bacon... I mean?? SO GOOD! Chorizo corn bread.. WHAT?? We will definitely order our next TG from here but why wait until then?

We even had a vegetarian who couldn\u2019t resist trying and loved. The corn casserole, sweet potatoes and oh yeah...we even ordered ribs (because this is a bbq place, right?!). They were sooooo delicious. You can tell that this chef knows how to do bbq. I can\u2019t wait to order again.",
