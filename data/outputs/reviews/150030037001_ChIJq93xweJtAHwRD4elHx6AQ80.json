It is always my go to despite all the other wonderful combinations.  My second favorite is the headcheese because of the fatty and peppery meat.  They also off an assortment of rice plates, Pho noodle soups, classic green papaya salad, spring and summer rolls, as well as wide assortment of other goodies.
