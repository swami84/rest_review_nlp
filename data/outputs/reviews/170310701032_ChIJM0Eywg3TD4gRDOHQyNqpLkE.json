My husband walked in around 6:15, albeit without a reservation and asked the hostess if we could wait for an outside table and that we would be quick.  We were told to come back around 8:15. As my husband came back out, another couple walked up. A host or Maitre D asked them if they had a reservation. They said no. I heard this with my own ears. He seated them at an outdoor table immediately.  We were 100% there first, a good five minutes before the other couple. I was pretty annoyed that they gave preferential treatment to people who arrived well after us and so I called and told them I was really looking forward to trying their restaurant. They offered no apology or anything, just said to come back and they would seat us indoors. As a food and travel blogger, being treated like this before I can even walk through the door is enough to turn me off forever.",

Its nice to see Vineyard Haven has added to there list of restaurants, and boy this restaurant doesn\u2019t disappoint. All ingredients are fresh and made to order from the drinks to the food. The owner/chief came out and asked how our meal was in a very busy atmosphere. We chatted and learned that he was Positano Italy which my wife and I visited over a year ago and made a instant connection with him. From the atmosphere, food, and personalization of every detail made our night an extra special one. This restaurant will do very well on the island. Would highly recommend. Already looking forward to dining and this restaurant on our visit to the island next year. Well done!",

I went to Martha\u2019s Vineyards thinking the food would be top notch!!! Coming from the North Shore Massachusetts I thought seafood would better or similar. I was utterly disappointed with most of the restaurants, and I tried quite a few of them. On the last day, while waiting for the ferry at the Vineyard terminal I walked to Salvatore\u2019s Ristorante. Thank God, the food was amazing, the service was amazing, the place was amazing. If you go to Martha\u2019s Vineyards and don\u2019t go to Salvatore\u2019s you haven\u2019t been anywhere\u2019s. This place is a must try.",
