Eggplant was cooked well and served over thick spaghetti with a nice simple sauce. Lasagna was tasty but wayyyy too salty. The salad was a little disappointing as well. It was just spinach with a few bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and artichokes on top. The vinaigrette was tasty, though.",

All the staff and clientele appeared to be Spanish speakers and I was the only person dining there the Friday night I visited. Other patrons were at the bar. The music was great, lots of songs with accordions talking about so and so the pistolero. They played wrestling on the TV. The decor is cool and tacky in a delightful way. Check out the photo \ud83d\ude42 The staff were super nice. The service is slower than slicker Italian restaurants in the neighborhood but it's worth it to slow down. The chicken cacciatore I ordered was delicious with great presentation. Definitely plan on returning and exploring the menu.",
