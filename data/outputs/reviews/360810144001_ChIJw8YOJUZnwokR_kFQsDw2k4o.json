Samosa's are ubiquitous around the NY region with it's ample South Asian population but not all are created equal. Punjabi's on Houston in the city does the best ones in Manhattan and Usha does the best ones in Queens.  There are 2 Usha's (cousins or some family connection) and just like a Bollywood movie there was a difference of opinion (on recipe i hope) and now you have Usha and Real Usha. My family prefer the Usha Foods one and so thats where we go.  The samosa isn't really pan Indian - I mean it's available just about everywhere but it's actually street food and specifically Bombay street food.  Being the big city melting pot that Bombay is it needs dishes which can satisfy the hungers of the millions of office dwellers who descend everyday at lunch time to grab a quick snack which is tasty enough for it to be something to look forward to and enough of a treat that you can eat it 3-4 times a week, 52 weeks a year for god alone how many years till retirement.  Thats where Bombay street foods come into their own. There is the world famous samosa and it's cousin the Batata Vada (a chick pea flour covered potato and spices filled dumpling that is fried). The samosa is usually served from a cart guy (no preparation as per order) and everyone has their own opinion of who has the best samosa.  Usha does a good rendition of this Bombay favorite along with the sweet savory and tangy chaats that are an after office favorite.  They also serve other kinds of Indian office lunch favorites like the stars of Udipi/ Tamil cuisine - Dosa's, Idli's etc.  If you work in the area or are just driving by - drop in for a Bombay style working mans lunch.",
