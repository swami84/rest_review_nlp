The manager and lady who was giving out the pizza got upset after I kindly asked for it twice. I was the last one to receive my order on purpose . I am a teenager and the people around me picking up their order were older. I felt powerless and figured that the manager was purposely letting me wait. This is a problem that as a teenager I see often. When your a teenager, you are sometimes not taken seriously by adults around you, and when you speak up, they assert their authority over you. I don\u2019t recommend this location. I would suggest going to another location!",
