I was excited to bring friends of mine to come eat here after visiting a few times before. I was sort of on the fence about this restaurant, but my friends were really excited to go. When we entered, one of the wait staff greeted us Moe's style by bellowing across the almost empty restaurant. The staff was behind the front counter & our party was standing near the front door; the only other couple dining there looked up from their meal, obviously disturbed by the shouting. We were sat & very excited to try out some menu items that we weren't able to eat before due to their unavailability on previous visits. We sat down & excitedly chose from the menu. Upon ordering, our server let us know that Foc'sle had none of the items on the 'Mains' section of the menu available. She gave us time to rethink our orders. One member of our party sat without water for several visits from the server & finally had to ask for more in the now empty dining room. Each couple in our party ordered the duck confit tots; one order was brought out as an appetizer, the other was brought out as a main. The garlic aioli on the tots was so lovely that one couple ordered a little more, upon delivery of the second order of tots, the server informed us that the restaurant had also run out of the aioli but she thought ketchup would be an ok substitute instead. The server wore her mask, mostly. However, while refilling the waters, she was maskless and speaking to us right over the open water pitcher. Our table agreed that the Yakitori seemed to be charred and scantily seasoned with very little to no sauce, the tots were okay, but we would've loved both orders with the correct sauce, and the tacos weren't what one member of our party was expecting. The corn tortilla wasn't what one would envision based on the menu description, and they fell apart immediately when attempting to pick them up. I ordered a drink I'd had before and it tasted and looked different than the last time, just as the wings did; although inconsistent, both were pretty palatable. We were a little disappointed generally, and forewent the dessert we were originally planning to get because one member of our party hadn't eaten much and he was left still wanting dinner. Everyone has off nights, and an isolated incident is absolutely understandable; however, just about everything about our visit was a swing and a miss. If I was the owner, I'd want to know if my clients had an experience such as this one. Unfortunately, everything seemed to fall flat.  We came in with high hopes, wanting to have a pleasant dining experience, however, besides the ambiance & lovely decoration, everything else was pretty disappointing.",

        "caption": "Foc\u2019sle has fast become my absolute favorite restaurant in Gainesville. Every time I think I\u2019ve tried everything on the menu Chef Glenn adds another stroke of genius. The banh mi is a crowd favorite but I have to say the Bistro Salad swept me off my feet. Not only is the food to die for but the staff and atmosphere are what keep me coming back every week. I knew I was in love when I came in the second time and Serena told me how glad she was to see me again, and then every time since. She is so fun and genuine and hospitable. The conversation is never dull at the bar as Phillip shakes and pours and goes into detail about his craft cocktails. He is a master of anticipating the needs of his bar guests. It\u2019s always a treat when Chef Glenn comes out of the kitchen and chats about his dishes and inspiration. I have been recommending Foc\u2019sle to everyone I know.",
