I really dont appreciate being treated in such manner being a Bushwick native, i grew up in this neighborhood and if anything they are the outsiders who dont belong. Its no surprise to me that all the great reviews are from people not of color. Then he wants to catch an attitude with me when i insisted it was ok just using one bag to save them the trouble. Respect to be respected. Im not there for their rudeness i am there for the healthy food. But then again the prices clearly arent targeted for the native majority who dont have equal job opportunities.

If their menu seems a bit higher in price, it's because they are making everything from scratch and nothing is imitation or concentrate.  Their raw chocolate treats are a MUST, they are quite powerful and you can definitely feel the wonderful properties of them right away. (And they taste great, too!)
