Places like Yafa are markers of gentrification in a mostly Latino and East Asian neighborhood. That being said, I have to respect Yafa for having reasonable prices. Their hibiscus tea was $3 when normally it would be $5-7 anywhere else. They did however tell me that the last order of lamb had already been given away right after I paid for mine. I instead got a chicken and rice dish which was very good, but a dish that I could perhaps make myself. All in all Yafa has great flavors but I probably won't frequent it very much as there are dozens of other local staples in the neighborhood that deserve as much attention. The breakfast here is delicious though",

The food is excellent and moderately priced and the selection of fresh juices, coffee, and the teas are second to none. I had the Yafa fried chicken sandwich with homemade potato chips and it was flavorful and crispy. I highly recommend it. The blend of Yemeni spiced fried chicken with the plum chipotle sauce made for a wonderful combination. And to top it off, the brussel sprout cole slaw gave it that summertime cookout flavor. Whether you're trying to get a quick bite or lounge around and sip on rare international coffee, Yafa Cafe has you covered.",

A few doors down from Yemeni-owned Yafa Newsstand & Deli, which has served the corner of 4th Avenue and 45th Street for many years, Yafa Caf\u00e9 has now been born.  For the better part of a couple months, only drinks were offered, but an open kitchen and the eager stories of its new operators (from the same family as the Yafa Deli) promised a marriage of foods from Brooklyn and Yemen, an exciting proposition.  When the sandwich board finally announced that breakfast and lunch were being served, the former was the goal on a first pass. Along with oats, bagels, and a gussied up bacon, egg and cheese sandwich lives the Yemeni breakfast ($10), which revolves around their excellent flaky traditional flatbread called khubz and a variety of \"breakfast dips.\"",
