David was great, funny,  fast, and got everything we needed very fast. Kudos to you David definitely made our experience the best in the morning.  So, after a long night out this is the happening place in the morning. Freshest fruit and just mouth watering croissant especially with orange jam. Fresh grounded coffee beans. If there is line it is worth the wait. We learned New Orleans look for the small areas away from the main tourist streets for the best food. Definitely another one to add to must have  in New Orleans.  A.Melo National Photography Gold Medalist 2021 foodie tour.",

The place offers ice cream and coffee drinks.  My wife and I both ordered Chocolate Ice Cream.  Very few table spaces (mostly due to the 25% occupancy rule for current shutdown rules). The ice cream was very delicious.  We both enjoyed sitting down and taking our time eating our bowls of ice cream. The lady on charge was April and she was very friendly.  I would highly recommend this location.  If you are anywhere nearby,  give this place a try!",

Each of the plates is $5 and they offer Draft beer flights, well cocktails, house wine, rum punch and palomas also for $5 each. I think the chicken and waffles have been replaced by jalepeno chicken poppers (according to their website). At this time HH runs from 3pm-7pm, available ONLY in the bar. Please check HH times and menu before going as things can quickly change. I've also been to Vacherie for breakfast and for dinner in the courtyard area. Thumbs up for all of those occasions.",

Ironically, we ended up sitting in a little space off the bar to take advantage of the bar happy hour specials. It was just perfect for our family of 6 to order a bunch of $5 small plates and share them all. We got to taste some authentic New Orleans food and also the most amazing sliders and fries we had in awhile!  The food came quickly and every item was absolutely delicious... I would highly recommend in particular the alligator sausage, chicken and waffles, and roast beef debris sliders with pickled red onions... Plus the waiter's recommendation of fried green tomatoes. All the sauces were so good we could drink them! Speaking of drinks, get the beer flight for the thirsty parents (or the Paloma). ;)  Truly the shining feature of the night though was how well we were taken care of by the bartender. He made our kids feel like kings and queens and was so attentive and even gave us suggestions for inexpensive family friendly activities to do while in town. Best waiter service we've had!",

The pecan gravy over top of it is delicious. Depending on where you're from, the chicken will be either good or very good. Bring from Iowa, I could get the same quality chicken in a breast twice the serving size. Don't let that dissuade you, very tasty!  My wife had the fried chicken biscuit with a house salad and was satisfied with the size and taste. For dessert we had the pecan pie.... Wow is all I can say. My wife are nearly as much as I did and she didn't think she liked pecan flavored anything before that.  If you're in the french quarter, give this place a shot, you will definitely NOT be disappointed.",

My husband got the Breakfast Bread pudding and it was AWESOME! It was not what we expected, it was beyond what we could have expected. It was so flavorful and the perfect amount for him. He had the coffee and I had an orange juice and it was real and very good. The prices were very fair for what you get and we ate in the bar and the service was great as well.

Sadly to say this probably not her cup of tea!! We have been staying here in this hotel st Marie where the bar is located for 4 days, coming to this place everyday for breakfast & happy hour. We had the best time prior this lady. Bartender in previous shift was awesome & Tom, the one that closes the bar @ midnight every night is a very professional & very nice to everyone. He has traveled all over the world & he is very open to all races. We have been having the best time here in New Orleans we kept saying everyone is so nice & welcoming to us.

Dry fish, everything else working at average. The service was worse. They just couldn't manage the logistics. At one point even, the waiter had served one course to half of our party (who politely waited for all to be served) then moved to another table to begin taking their orders. That was actually worse than not serving anyone would have been.  The hard desserts were served straight from their extended stay in the coldest part of the fridge (not appropriate to the desserts) and the coffee was scorched (I love me some CDM, French Market, and other coffee and chicory - so don't think me a light weight; I get New Orleans coffee. This just wasn't it).  All in all, just so-so. I would rate at 2.5 if Google allowed for it.",

We started at the bar for an exceptional $5 happy hour--perfect Pimms cups. Restaurant has great ambiance with very attentive and friendly service (Paul). The seafood gumbo is solid, Brussels and pork belly superb, and a gigantic portion size for the pork shank entree with the creamiest grits. All three desserts we tried were phenomenal and not too sugary which is rare for this town. Overall just wonderful. We will be back.",
