Whatever sauce they put on the croissant breakfast sandwich should be award winning. Definitely will be hitting them up for catering once I need to!",

        "caption": "Website menu is out of date and does not list prices. They don't answer the phone. Their GrubHub, Seamless, PostMates, etc are always closed. I think this spot just does catering? Very confusing. Other reviews are from close to 1 year ago, maybe things were different then. Nonetheless, skip this joint - easier lunches to be had on same street.  EDIT: Owner replied, its effectively takeout via in-person only. Contrary to what they stated tho, they are in fact still listed online at Seamless and Postmates - just set to \u201cclosed\u201d. The links are in the Google Maps listing and their website literally states they use the delivery apps. To be fair to owner, I\u2019ll have to go in and get takeout it seems. Will update again, should I decide to do so.  EDIT 2: I went into for a breakfast sandwich. Honestly it was pretty tasty. Due to no indoor seating, its more-of a summer lunch spot. Due to food being good, but still clearly being mismanaged from online POV, I rate 3 stars.",
