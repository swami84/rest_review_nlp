No complaints and would strongly recommend. Service was good. My food came out hot and correct. I'm really not hard to please. The place isn't the most upscale but is cozy. Typical hole in the wall which happens to be my preference. Overall I would go again. The food was good. The vibe was amazing and the crowd was drama free. That goes a long way in Baltimore. My only complaints were the bathroom could have been bit cleaner and parking sucked. Definitely will give it another try.",

Bre was an excellent server. She kept everything flowing the whole night. Ms. Candy put her whole heart into every one of those cocktails. $6 Happy Hour drinks are worth every penny. You may even need an Uber if you drove. lol Food was excellent. The Caesar salad was delicious with the savory cornbread  croutons. The parmesan wings were so tender. We meet the chef, he hugged everyone at the table or I should say everyone at the table hugged him lol Rico the DJ was extra attentive to the Bday Queen we were there to celebrate. None of us had a complaint about anything. And just as Kim greeted us, she saw us all off to our cars. Thanks Next Phaze, we will be back",

Haven't met the owner yet but the staff who waited on me were the best!! I had Bayou pasta. Perfect for lunch--chicken Alfredo with a soulful touch. Yummy. I've already begun to tell friends, look forward to going back. Also ordered the banana pudding, hoping as time goes on it will take on the mantel of \"puddin\". The coffee is great and with a little more soul in the puddin' I'd go just for coffee and banana pudding. Can't wait to get back. The Very Best To You All.",

On Friday evening the food is set up buffet style (the food selections are prepared in advance and dished out by servers).  Customers must stand in line to order from the menu of the day; and select an entree and two sides.  Their fried catfish is the hands down favorite.  The food preparation is very inconsistent; and 2 of 3 times I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve returned either an entree or side dish. There isn\u2019t any food or drink service.  Customers must get those items themselves.  On the other hand,  the music is jamming!!!  They\u2019ve booked the top talent in the area; and that makes the visit to the the cafe worth my time.  What can I say?  I\u2019m a music lover?",

Entertainment for the night was a comedic host ( forgot his name - sorry) and Marc Evans and his band. Fabulous and fun show. Once they get everything settled, it will be 5 stars.",
