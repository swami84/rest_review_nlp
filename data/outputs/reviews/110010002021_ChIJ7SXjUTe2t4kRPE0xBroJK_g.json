Unfortunately, none of our items were tasty. The scallion pancakes were way too crispy, oily, and hard to chew. The crispy eggplant was mostly made up of the batter and very little eggplant. The pork dumplings were average. The worst was the sweet and sour chicken - very long and thin pieces with minimal meat and again mostly batter. The portions were small. After finishing our meal, we were left unsatisfied and felt as if all we had eaten was fried batter.  On the plus side, we got a free Diet Coke with our order, and that was good!",

        "caption": "Used to come here often because we loved it, loved the soup dumplings, and loved the service, especially Flo. After not coming here for months, we went back last week and we were sad to learn the atmosphere is not the same and Flo is no longer there. :(  The soup dumplings were still pretty good, but the rest of our lunch was ok. The fried rice and lo mein were good, but we can tell other items were different. The menu selections were slightly different too with a new looking menu. Overall food was pretty good, but some items just didn\u2019t seem the same to me and it seemed like some menu items were missing.  Not having Flo there was definitely not the same. She knew us by name and knew we loved the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and would get our order for that right away\u2014usually ordering 4-5 orders at a time for the 3 of us. It takes longer to cook, so that is why some people get it later in their meal. They no longer tell you that, so people should be prepared that it could take a while for the soup dumplings to arrive.  Flo was the friendliest person there and gave us the best service, even if she was super busy. Always took the time to chat with us and was one of the reasons why we loved coming there. It was our favorite place for us to celebrate our special occasions, including birthdays and a graduation celebration meal. We used to eat so many soup dumplings (or xiao long bao) that we had our picture on the Xiao Long Bao Wall of Fame (or XLB Wall of Fame) there in the dining room.  We went back last week for the first time in months (since the early spring) and saw that our picture is no longer on the wall (all are gone), Flo is no longer there; other servers we know are no longer there; our server that we had that day was not as fast, attentive, or friendly; and the food was just ok. The xiao long bao still tastes delicious, but the overall atmosphere was not the same. We will go back, mostly for the soup dumplings, but not sure how often.  If anyone happens to know where Flo is now, can you please let me know? Would be great to see her again. I truly regret not going there since earlier this year, especially since we used to be regulars. :(",

We usually share dishes (in the classic family style that all Chinese people love), and almost everything I've had has been between decent and great. The last time I was here, I had the Scallion Pancake (which is one of my childhood favorites and Shanghai Lounge did not disappoint me), Cumin Chicken (also amazing), and Vegetable Lo Mein (a classic that you really can't go wrong with). Some of my other favorites are the Ma Po Tofu and Eggplant with Hot Garlic Sauce. The food is all pretty good, although nothing really stands out. I also came here to celebrate Lunar New Year last year and we were seated at the giant table in the back upstairs. It's unfortunate that they don't have any larger seating options, but it's understandable considering the price of Georgetown real estate. The service is also pretty decent; most of the servers are kind and helpful, although the place does seem a bit short-staffed at times since service tends to be pretty slow during peak hours. But the owner is an absolute gem and is one of the kindest people I've ever met. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of authentic Chinese -- or, even more broadly, Asian -- restaurants to choose from in the Georgetown neighborhood, so, unless you want to travel, Shanghai Lounge is probably your best bet for some decent, reasonably priced, and relatively authentic Chinese food.",

If you're in the mood for American Chinese, their General Tso's is amazing - lightly sweet, spicy, crispy, moist chicken. Everything is fresh and flavors are pretty subtle. Only let down is that there isn't much Shanghai food apart from some dumplings and street food. Would love to see some stuffed lotus with osmanthus sauce, pork knuckle, flash fried river shrimp, and crab soup to live up to the name!",

The steamed and pan fried dumplings are hand made as well as the soup dumplings. We just kept ordering them because they were so good. Also I ordered a bubble tea expecting the standard I have had so many times. I was blown away as this was made in a glass and the milk was a little frothy as it was hand stirred. There was no Ice and it made the tea so.much more enjoyable.as it didn't matter down. 5/5 star just on the bubble tea. Thanks so much for having us!!! We will be back just for this place.",

We always order soup dumpling (pan seared all the way), crispy beef, and the cumin chicken (packs some heat). Additionally, Flo is my favorite waitress in all of DC, as she caters to every customer as they walk in and makes the entire ambiance of the restaurant. The food here is insane, as all reviews should be based on food, but Flo took the experience to a whole other level. Follow @stoopkidseat on Instagram for more deets!",

Aside from the soup dumplings I had the appetizer portion of Dan Dan Noodles, which was good but lacking in spice. Even if the flavors were milder than I would expect, the actual food did have an authentic quality to it.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, which was by no means exceptional but certainly above average. I would classify it between a typical carry-out restaurant and bigger restaurant like Sichuan Palace. I will definitely go back and try a few other things on the menu.",

        "caption": "Yay, another place to get soup dumplings (xiao long bao, XLB) besides Bob's Shanghai in Rockville! I heard of Shanghai Lounge through Yelp and through a particularly serendipitous chance, I was in Georgetown last night with my boyfriend, his parents, and some family friends. The hostess/server, Florence, greeted us and engaged in conversation with us throughout the course of our dinner. She suggested a few dishes and we ended up getting two orders of XLB, sea-salt prawns, mapo tofu, spicy braised fish, \"sad eggplant,\" cumin lamb, and bok choy.  The XLB were authentic although there was not that much soup and the skin is a little thicker than traditional Shanghai XLB. A good XLB should have thin skin, tender/slightly loose pork inside, and the broth should be rich and porky. Still, not too bad for Georgetown and at least there's a second place I know I can get authentic XLB other than Rockville. I still prefer the XLB at Bob's Shanghai though.  The spicy braised fish was unfortunately not up to my spice level, as the other people in our party were not as enthusiastic about spice as I was so we asked for mild. I am a huge lover of spicy food and especially Sichuan food. My favorite Sichuan dish is actually this spicy braised fish, so I was looking forward to trying it and comparing it to the other spicy braised fish I've had in the area. Since it wasn't spicy, it lost a lot of its flavor, but I will say the fish fillets were very tender. Same with the mapo tofu, it wasn't spicy so it lost a lot of its unique flavor but overall it was decent. The cumin lamb was surprisingly tasty and next to the the XLB, the two dishes were my favorite of the evening.  One thing that bugged me is that they charge for tea. I feel like that's just wrong for Chinese restaurants. In my books, tea and rice are a given. Usually, restaurants won't charge for tea or rice but there's always the occasional one that wants to nickel and dime you. A little disappointing that this place charges for tea (even though I understand that running a business is not easy, especially in expensive Georgetown). At least they warn you on their menu that they will charge for tea, because a lot of places that do charge for tea won't say anything until you get the bill.  Overall, I'd say a solid 3.5 stars for food. There are definitely authentic dishes on the menu. The restaurant is small but it's off of the main roads in Georgetown so there's more parking than M or Wisconsin Street. This place is certainly worth a try if you're around and craving Chinese food.",

Soup was just spicy enough, while thr kung pao chicken was a little lacking IMO, but then again I've lived in China for 2 years and Californian Hispanic so I like my spicy foods. So just take that into consideration: spiciness is not that spicy, don't be scared of it.  tl;dr Good Americanized Chinese food, very clean place, friendly and helpful staff at great prices.",
