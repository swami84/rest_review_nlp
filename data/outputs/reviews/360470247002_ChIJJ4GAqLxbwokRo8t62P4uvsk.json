I texted the number the days before my actual dinner date and I got no response at all. Just wanted to confirm the date, time & to make sure the meal was what I wanted. The amount of $$$ I paid, I should have had open communication about what I paid for. I ended up dm\u2019ing the actual ig page. I never received my code to the door & I never received my menu. Due to the lack of communication days before my date, once I arrived, when the chef began to cook my food, he made beef & chicken which none of those were any of my selections. (Because I don\u2019t eat beef or chicken) And I showed the chef what I selected in my account. Being that the wrong dinner selections were prepared, chef had to hurry up and make the correct meals. Which took away from my eating time. Again, not the chefs fault. Also, the allergies that I communicated to the number I texted wasn\u2019t communicated to the chef. I am just pointing out where I feel they need improvement. But overall, it was an experience.",

Beware of the site adding charges for services you didn\u2019t choose, beware of the manager providing falsified information, lack of cancellation policy on the site or in writing, and the concierge\u2019s poor customer service.  Unfortunately I can\u2019t write of my experience within the venue because my problems with the manager and their process began before I could even experience anything.  This post is about the poor communication, care, and fraud of a business this is. I was told by a friend that has a membership I could use her membership to plan my birthday party, she was being a helpful friend in knowing that during these times, social distance celebrations are preferred. She was also under the impression I could use her membership since she paused $110 for it, hadn\u2019t used it yet and the website says \u201cShare with friends and Family\u201d.  I booked on her account, chose the date, time, decorations, and hostess, and paid $1500 upfront, no deposit, no payment plan, $1500 whole entire cost upfront. I thought it was odd that I didn\u2019t get a immediate email with a confirmation or receipt especially when I saw that the site added an extra service to my payment that I never chose. But I assumed I could rectify that when I got a itimized receipt so I could see exactly where the entire $1500 was going. My friend contacted me and said she received a text with my confirmation code, I thought that was odd because I booked it, I paid for it. I called the number listed and told the manager that I was using my friends membership and asked if he could send me the confirmation as opposed to her, since it is after all MY BIRTHDAY! He said sure, send me your name, email address and number and I\u2019ll send you the confirmation, he also told me to go back on the account and type that same information in. Two weeks passed and I received NOTHING! No confirmation, no receipt of payments nothing.  Later on, I found out I needed to cancel, their website has no cancellation policy listed, so I called. I was told you get a 50% refund on your deposit, that\u2019s Odd, I didn\u2019t make a deposit, I was never promoted to, I made a full payment. Do you mean I get a 50% refund on my payment? I asked, I was told yes. To be clear the company has no cancellation policy listed, but what\u2019s going last Half of your money is you need to cancel, and I was canceling 30 days before my intended booking date. I asked for a itimized receipt of what I was paying for, and a copy of their cancellation policy many times which I never received.  1 week later, I went to my bank account and realized the company took a \u201crenew\u201d membership fee off my card. How can you renew a membership you never had in the first place? Clearly the manager used my information that he told me to provide so that I could be sent a confirmation, to create a membership account and then charge me for it.  Needless to say, I won\u2019t be doing business with Room 24k again, my friends will be discontinuing their memberships, and I will continue to encourage those in my networks to do that same.",
