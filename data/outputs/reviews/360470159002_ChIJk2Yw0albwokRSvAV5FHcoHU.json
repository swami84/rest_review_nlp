We ordered our food and realized some of out items wasn't of our flavor. Talked to management because our waitress went on lunch and he was our server now. We politely explained that we were not too pleased with some of the food. He explained that once the food is made that we still have to pay for it (which is fine). He did not offer any type of accommodation seeing that we were not indulging in our food. We understood the policy but his delivery and lack of empathy was not customer service quality. Once our waitress returned from her break we explained to her the problem and how the manager at the time should have asked if there was anything he can do to make it better. She also could not accommodate us and the way she was talking to us seem as though she was trying to provoke us, which is not of our nature. She did offer to give us carry outs, which we accepted. In my opinion in a place of establishment like this there should have been better customer service and at least some type of accommodations if the customer still has to pay for their food.

I have ordered a delivery to the office for many ppl, food (Farmer Salad) came in a box, not mixed and it is not possible to mix that salad in that box! The box is full of greens and a few pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Another salad (Earthy Kale Salad) came in in the plastic box full of kale and a few cherry tomatoes halves (also not possible to mix).  QUESADILLA  is tiny!! The delivery guy is rude, asked for tips (tips were added to the bill online). 2 of the salads were missing, we called and the person on the phone referred us to Grubhub to request another driver (!). I would think they should fix the mistake they made, not us. According to other employees of the office Burger was good! So, salads are 1 star, Burgers are 5 star. But the whole experience is a decaffeinate \"NO\", will not order again. there are soooo many places around who are excellent in preparing food and caring for their clients. Please look at the pictures i posted, compare them with the ones on the website and keep in mind that the boxes with salads are FULL of greens and dusted with other ingredients on top. Absolutely tasteless.",

My friends ordered Queso Breakfast Burrito, which he thinks is amazing, mouthful of flavors and a pool of cheese from the queso sauce.  Coffee is freshly grind coffee by Stumptown $3, not pricey but really good. Hisbiscus tea is refreshing as expected. Also, for $7 more you can get a glass of mimosa. We had the place almost all up to ourselves on a Monday morning.  The place is clean and cool with a really good vibe.  I will be back for sure.

I've been to so many chicken and waffle places over the past year, oh my. Well, Bar Basic didn't disappoint. The waffle was not your typical one you get with a chicken and waffle meal. First of all it was and in the traditional Belgian waffle style. I thoroughly enjoyed the waffle and the chicken was moist and right out the hot oil. My friend had the fish Po' Boy and she enjoyed her meal as well.  Bar Basic is not some fancy spot, it's very mom-n-pop and so you may have to wait a bit to be seated but because it is a mom and pop type restaurant your getting all that tender love and care in every dish. Bar Basic was recommended to me a few months ago and I finally got a chance to experience it and like I said in the very beginning, it didn't disappoint. I shall return and you should get off your hind parts and get those thighs over there right now. Enjoy",

Once you're seated and you peruse the menu, you might realize you made the right decision in coming here. The interior is cute and simple, with reclaimed wood table, the spacing between chairs is not tight and you have a lot of room to move around or stretching your arms.  I went with a popular choice, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger (Pressed classic potato bun sandwich with chicken, coleslaw, pickled, & chipotle mayo), and we all shared a few sides like cilantro lime rice, general tso's wing, guacamole and chips, and fries. First off, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger was heaven. The chicken, creamy chipotle mayo, and pickled cabbage's textures blended beautifully without any of the flavors overpowering each other. I have never tried General Tso' Wing before but if you're a fan of wing you must give this one a shot at least. I washed it all down with a glass of their fresh agua pine juice, which was solid and recommended.  Our waitress was quick and accurate. All of the staff moved with a motivated frenetic energy. There are many brunch option places in Brooklyn, but Bar Basic should be near the top of your list.  Also did i mentioned this restaurant is a kid's friendly restaurant and they have stroller parking area.",

My boyfriend ordered hangover cure and one of their fall cocktail, apple hot toddy. He absolutely love it.  All food and cocktails are amazing, the service is excellent, friendly, and welcoming. My waiter comes back every once a while to check on us. You won\u2019t be disappointed.  By the way, i love their decor and the vibe just un-believeably chill. I went there on Saturday which they have live music which is a extra touch to our experience. Good vibes.

Nothing should be skip from their food menu, all food is amazing. Finally and most importantly, you can actually have a conversation here.  Definitely a new favorite spot.

The owner of this restaurant kept all of the positive aspects built up and added a Southern chill type of vibe with a laid back theme. The tables and chair made by reclaimed wood, the bar counter also made by reclaimed support beam wood. I love their concept of sustainability and recycled, reused the materials. The restaurant is surrounded by live plants and flowers, it is liked a indoor garden. Absolutely stunning and inviting.  I recognize the quality ingredients used and that, at the sacrifice of cost percentages, they serve ample and well balanced entrees that over-satisfy an apatite as large as mine (a 130+ lb triathlete who needs her k-calories;)  To sum this up, go there and see for yourself, you will not be dissatisfied with this new addition to Park Slope! I am all about support small local business and i think you should too.  Favorite items: Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle (sweet and savory) Basic Burger (love the pickled cabbage) Mighty Wing (a MUST, if you love wing, you will fall in love with this) Old Fashioned Cocktails (so smooth, a MUST have) Coffee (they use La Colombe Roaster coffee, really good espresso drink) Shrimp Gumbo (their signature dish, rich and thick)  Memorable Staff: Nick (Server) Ryan (Bar Tender)",

Because that is exactly how delicious the banana waffle tasted while having Brunch at Bar Basic! It was the epitome of food greatness but I will come back to that in a bit....  Bar Basic is located in the north Park Slope of Brooklyn which is quite a quiet and family friendly place. They are newly opened in the area, an great addition to the neighbor. We decided to come here for brunch after I went on Yelp and saw all of the fantastic looking food in people's postings. Once we arrived at Bar Basic, we were definitely able to confirm not only great looking but fabulously smelling food at the time when you entered! I will never be able to verbalize just how wonderful the aromas were that emanated from the various dishes. All we did was ooh and aah at every single plate that went by us....It is a true testament to them having a extraordinary selection of options on their brunch menu!  The friendly hostess informed us that we will have to wait about 20 minutes, however we were probably seated in about 10 minutes which was nice. Bar Basic staff provided prompt service as we received water, coffee and mimosa quickly. Thanks to Peter and Nick for being so lovely!  Ok....so I had the Banana waffle w / side of organic spring salad. Banana waffle is the best tasting buttery pieces of waffle that I have ever had! Crispy around the edges and soft, fluffy goodness in the middle. Oh my.....the homemade dulce de leche syrup and marvelous walnut that complimented the waffle made it perfection throughout each and every bite! I was also told about and got to taste some of egg benedict, perfect porched egg and creamy hollandaise sauce....Spectacular! The dried roasted shiitake mushroom and spinach went well with the egg benedict with just perfect amount of braised pulled pork end. The dish just lovely.  We had such a pleasurable experience...I need some more of that banana waffle in my life! For the advice, you have to wait roughly 20 minutes for the waffle since it is made to order. It is totally worth the wait. I promised.",

We went back a few times hoping the burgers would be better since the Park Slope area by far needs better ones, but it hasn't improved. Burgers have potential, but they all had this sweetness to it that was a little odd. Might be in the burger, or the sauce but it tastes like a bunch of sugar was added. The veggies burger, Basic, Chicken, Pork sliders all suffered from this. The buttermilk chicken burger was a let down as well. The chicken quality/flavor was lacking and came across as nothing special. They serve breakfast now so we may try it. I just hope trying this place again isn't a waste again. Decent place, but not anything memorable.",

The first batch were made with the cheese when the kids ordered cheese on the side, and the second time, he said there was something wrong with the batter so they were unservable. The waiter neglected to tell us any of this until it was too late to order something else and the rest of us had finished our burgers.

After taking our drink requests, he reviewed Bar Basic most popular brunch items to include brief descriptions of them. We were given just enough time to look over the entire menu before he returned to take our orders. Everything on the menu read very appetizing. Ultimately I chose the Shrimp Gumbo.  The best way to describe it are in the words of  Rachael Ray who said, \" it's like a party in my mouth.\" The dish was flavorful, not lacking anything that I could think of. The gumbo were thick and smooth as I like, the shrimp prepared perfectly!  I have absolutely no complaints. My next visit will be next month to celebrate my father's birthday. Let's hope that he enjoys it as much as I did today.",

Sophisticated twists on typical Southern cuisine join, many bourbon-based, in the pretty rustic-chic dining room of this happening in North Park Slope. This restaurant tucked away just enough from busy streets and attended by friendly servers. Few blocks away from grand army plaza and barclay center. Great addition to the neighbor.  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with red velvet waffle, the chicken was juicy and full of spice.  This is the place if you want your soul to be satisfied.",
