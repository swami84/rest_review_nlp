To be honest, my boyfriend and I had intended to go to Pizzeria Bebu, but with an hour and a half wait (no way), we needed to find somewhere else close for some pizza. We had been to Sono before for drinks but decided to walk over and give it a try for dinner. We were seated immediately at the bar and our bartender was awesome. We got a couple of beers, and the burrata for an appetizer. We felt it was lacking in flavor a little bit but still enjoyable. Next we shared the sopressata pizza. It was absolutely incredible. Perfect amount of spice, extremely flavorful meat, and just perfectly cooked pizza. We couldn't have been more pleased. I'll be honest we expected something pretty average but were blown away and would come back 100%, which is very significant to me in terms of Chicago pizza. Also, our bartender heard that it was my birthday and gave my boyfriend and I free beers! So generous! Loved my experience here and I'm excited to go back :)",

The good: The pizzas were delicious - the crust was hearty yet airy and flaky. They have a pretty decent selection of topping styles to choose from (pesto and burrata was one), and the portion sizes of the pizzas were well-sized and great for splitting (2 for 4 people was fine). The waiter was friendly and the low-lit ambiance was a nice touch.  The not-so-good: Expensive. Luckily our apps were discounted, but if they weren't it would've been a large bill. Also, the calamari had fried peppers in it. Which, while good, seemed like a cop out to fill the plate.  Food/drink: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10",

We we're sitting away from our large group and had occasional visitors stop by to chat. Her timing with regard to course delivery was served in harmony with our conversations. Impeccably timed interjections. Nick our friends' server was amazing, treating everyone as if they were already longtime friends and patrons. His attitude was solid gold as we were there with a separate long table of no less than 8 kids sitting alone together. He made everyone feel individually special.  We split a salad and pizza. The greens were super fresh and dressed just right. The pizza had a little extra crunch on its crackery crust. Not as light and open than than the typical Neapolitan bordo. Nice...given we there to enjoy the flavor over feeling weighed down, overloaded, or over-salted from a restaurant meal. It was a wonderful wood-fired flat bread with high quality toppings. Great pizza after settling in and getting accustomed to its character around the second slice. The valet was convenient as well. I'm a walking billboard.",

So, after a quick Google search this place came up.  A really nice place, loved the decor and overall vibe. Service was a little slow but it did seem like they were short staffed for the night (no points deducted for that). My waiter/bartender was on point, and went through the drinks and the various options available and offered great suggestions (also hella cute lol). We ended up getting the arancini for the appetizer and the spinach pizza (with ricotta and goat cheese). First of all that pizza just was so fabulous I would honestly go back for that alone. The arancini looked fabulous and had a lovely texture perfectly crispy but it was lacking some serious salt.  I didn't want to deduct any points for that because it could've just been an off night.  I will go back for the fabulous pizza (and the eye candy lol)",

This time we called in an order for carry-out instead of dining in.  I arrived exactly at the estimated time, went to the bar to pay and pick up the order (four pizzas and two appetizers).  The bartender went to the back, and I could see him talking to various people.   He came back empty handed, to say that they gave our order away to another customer.  He asked if they should re-make it.  I said that we had several young kids who needed to eat soon, and was debating, when he said, \u201cwell, the people who took it obviously also got the wrong order, so we can see if they bring it back.\u201d  I said that no way would I take an order that left the restaurant and was returned.  I agreed to have them remake the order, as it would take us longer to order from a different restaurant.  I then called my son-in-law, who was parked in their lot (there is no street parking in front of the restaurant).  My son-in-law told the parking lot attendant that he needed to be there for about 20 minutes, as the restaurant made a mistake and had to remake the pizzas.  He was told in no uncertain terms that he was welcome to stay there, but would have to pay the parking fee.  He was upset with this, and told me he would be circling the block waiting for me.  The order came out fairly quickly, I was given a check, and I told the bartender that after their mistakes it was wrong that I was not at least offered something for my trouble.  He replied, \u201cwell, I did say I was sorry.\u201d  I think that is unconscionable.  I went outside and called my son-in-law to tell him that I was outside.  It took him about 10 minutes to navigate the traffic around North Ave & Clybourne, by which time (in 14 degree weather) the meal was ice cold.  When we got home with the food, we found that (1) the mozzarella came without the crostini. I know this is just toast, but the fun is spreading the fresh mozzarella on something, and we ended up just eating it plain (not the way it should be served).  Also, (2) none of the pizzas were cut.  Again, not normally a huge deal, but on top of everything else taking more time to find a long knife and cutting the pies just added more time to have the pizzas get cold.  In summary, they totally blew the order, could not communicate with their parking lot, did not include all that was ordered, and having the bartender say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was insufficient.  If you want good pizza and app\u2019s, by all means go in, but absolutely DO NOT ORDER CARRY-OUT FROM THEM.",

Cannot go wrong here. I love all of the pizzas from simple margarita to more complex creations. My favorite is the spicy calpiccola with charred red onions and spicy sauce. YUM.",
