The burnt cheese on the edge hits perfectly. For some people these things might be a turnoff, others not so much. Haven't tried the roast beef yet but that is next.  Update: Got the roast beef. Really good. Heavy on the mayo which I enjoyed. Beef was cooked perfectly. I wish the bun was a little bigger but this was seriously one of the best I've had",

I haven't tried the beef three way yet, but I'm pleased to see someone in Boston doing it right! The North shore beef stylee is really the only good one for what it is, other roast beefs don't compare. Not easy to find a good beef spot in Boston proper \u2014 will go here in a heartbeat next time I'm craving one.  Friendly and quick service, too. Thanks Hot Box!",

Some edges of the meat were beginning to change colours. Wasn\u2019t fresh tasting.  I placed an order via toast tab, received the 'ready\u2019 text and walked to the window to find out someone else named Robert took it.  Now I had to wait for the guy to finagle a rushed sandwich. Minimal mayo, bbq and cheese. Hard to compare experiences with Mike and Patty\u2019s. Best bet is avoid both at all costs after these lousy experiences.",

Crust kind of chewy, not crispy the way it should be, kind of like when you microwave a piece of pizza rather than putting it in a toaster oven to reheat.

Then they ate their words with the whole pizza! And now often ask Me to go get more pizza from Hot Box! Ghost pickle pizza is the best one (imho :]), and I love adding mushrooms to it, which has never been a problem to order on-line or in person. The staff is amazing as well, so friendly and professional! Looks like the owners care about their staff and in return the staff cares about the customers. Not to forget, for the quality and the size of their food - the prices are very fair! Also the spot is super cute and who ever did the design for them did an amazing job. Wish I could give more than just 5 stars. #getlit get Hot Box! \ud83d\udc9f",

Hot Box is definitely one of the most popular food joints at Bow Market, I mean, who doesn\u2019t want some delicious pizza and roast beef sandwiches?! Talk about comfort food!  I love the pink red/pink neon signs and the overall theme of Hot Box. It\u2019s very \u201chip\u201d and modern. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. Service is efficient.  My personal favorite on their menu would definitely be the pepperoni pizza. It looks and tastes absolutely amazing! I\u2019m such a big fan of thin crust pizzas, but the ones here hit the spot! They also have an interesting pizza where they add pickles to it, and I\u2019m definitely planning on going back to try that.  Everyone needs to check out Hot Box in the Bow Market asap!",
