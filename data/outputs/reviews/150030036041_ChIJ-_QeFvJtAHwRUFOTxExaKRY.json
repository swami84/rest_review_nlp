The lunch special ($15.95) offered a large plate of meat. We did enjoy that. We could barely finish half. The wait service was icy at first but that may have been because the waitress did not seem to speak English. She \"warmed\" up and offered to refill the sides. There's an upscale BBQ across the street and we'll give that one a try next time. It's a couple of dollars more expensive, but if it's clean, it will be worth it.",

But they are short staffed as of writing this review, and their service isn\u2019t bad, but you might have to wait until their 2-3 waitresses are done serving others to get to your table.  Now on top of that my personal experience there, it may have been that particular day and the waitress wasn\u2019t in the mood, but my friend and I went there and only ordered one dish, because we were splitting the bill due to the fairly high price point (we are college students), which was accepted and served. When it arrived, the waitress seemed a bit unhappy due to the fact that two people ordered only one dish. Now maybe it was out of courtesy for two of us to be ordering one plate at their restaurant, but my friend and I felt a bit uneasy and guilty.  But please don\u2019t take my personal experience as a bad one! The food there is good and the workers there have a long day and tried their best to provide us the best service they can!

Since the building has been sold, which means the restaurant will close when the building tenants finally have to leave, I decided to finally sample the food and service.  It was late afternoon when I arrived and I was very hungry. I ordered the BBQ kalbi ribs. When my food arrived, I was surprised by the generous portions of Kim Chee and other vegetables which accompanied my kalbi. The meal actually looked like it could have fed two people and I did my best to finish everything in front of me.  I have certainly missed-out by not coming here sooner and I hope that they will relocate instead of shutting-down. The service was excellent and I absolutely plan to eat there again.",

We received 2 kinds of kimchi, 2 kinds of giant radish dish, potato salad and romaine lettuce salad as our side dish.  For a place that charges 30$ for each order of beef, this is really limited.  2) We ordered 2 Sang-kalbi;( aka raw, unmarinated),  and 1 cha-dol-bagi (thinly sliced beef);    First, they gave us 2 orders of frozen sirloin and try to pass that off as short ribs (kalbi). frozen sirloin, as expected had little flavor and tough to chew.   When we complained, they took our meat away and then brought out what appeared more to be short rib, but frozen also (see photo).   told us that's the best what they can do,    this short rib also had zero flavor.  3) asked for order of rice and soup (kimchi Jjigae), which they promptly forgot and didn't serve us or cook our meat, and I had to do so on my own.  There seems to be newer Korean BBQ place in Honolulu, and therefore, this place doesn't deserve my future BBQ $$.  I will end with a disclaimer that i didn't try their hotpot, so that remains to be seen.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) It is definitely the worst Korean restaurant in Hawaii. Throw away your appetite and use it as it goes. Not long ago, Korean food culture was also introduced, and foreign groups of business-critical guests attended and went to the country. It's not only a taste but a restaurant with no conscience. First of all, since the restaurant visuals are dark, there are many strip bars around, so the appearance has been a little difficult. Anyway, I just wanted the restaurant to be okay .. I became a yakiniku specialty restaurant, and I knew how to chew the rubber because the meat taste was so poor. Decisively, when the calculation was made, a total of 24 servings came out and 24 servings were taken, but the aunt of the owner used the table for 30 seats and asked to pay 30 servings. Whatever this is, of course, our side said it was an unfair thing and we could never pay extra. But she wasn't an ordinary woman. He said that he would call the police without hesitation, and treated us as a fraudster. Rather, we wanted to sue the owner's aunt who was trying to cheat us. She was very rude to her aggressive attitude. In the meantime, makeup was quite a burden because of her makeup level. The foreign atmosphere was uncomfortable because of such a rough atmosphere, and eventually came out to eat 300 dollars. So far, it is very unpleasant that the person is not released. Oh, for reference, the young male waiter there seems to be the only one who is conscientious. Anyway, I'm so sorry that I'm sorry all the time.

The quality of their meats, the quantity and variety of their banchan (side dishes) and their prices are great. I never leave disappointed.  The ajummas run this place so be on your best behavior and you will get good service. Become a regular and you'll get great service! Be rude and disrespectful and you on your own.  If you love AYCE Korean yakiniku then I highly recommend Seoul Garden. We always used to go to other places like Sikdorak which were cheap and good, but since being to Seoul Garden and getting a taste of the good stuff like the handmade mandoo, we have been hooked ever since and don't mind paying the extra $3 difference.  They also serve a lot of other menu items so if you love trying out different Korean dishes then Seoul Garden is a great place for that. We see a lot of visiting Koreans come in and get these great meals that make us want to ask what that is and try it on our next visit.  Bottom line, I say go in and try it for yourself. I did and now it has become one of my favorite spots.",

The food was ok, but the waitress was very very rude. The worst experience ever. We tipped for more than 10% but they demanded 15%. We paid the bill so we walked out to the door but they chased us down, yelling at us that we had to pay 15% minimum. It was the most rude and unimaginable experience ever. So shame that the bible verses were hanging on the wall. Look at many others' review, experiencing the same horrible situations. \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \ud55c\uc778\uc2dd\ub2f9!!!!!",

The decor isn't anything to write home about but it's better than most Korean joints here and both comfortable and private.  My main gripe here is service and price.  Dinner is way overpriced (about $30 a person) though lunch is pretty affordable.  Service-wise it's very abrupt and Korean oriented, i.e. haole's are expected to know what they want and questions are near impossible (given most of the staff barely speaks understandable English); they are also extremely abrupt and prone to ignoring you MID SENTENCE to chat with their girlfriends.  That being said I put up with it all as the food was pretty solid but I'm done after today; never again.  Today was the second time in my life a waitress actually ran out to the parking lot and beat on my door window because I gave a less than expected (8% instead of expected 18%) tip even though she didn't do a damn thing the entire hour I was there other than bring the food, ignore my wife, start texiting her friends mid-sentence in an order, and make under-her-breath snorts and comments about the food we ordered.  For example my daughter wanted some Oolang tee and she said, as she was writing it down, \"Oolang not for kids, why the order that\" in that just perceptible but deniable passive aggressive tone.  So basically food good, price about 25% to much, and service COMPLETE CRAP (even for an Asian joint)",
