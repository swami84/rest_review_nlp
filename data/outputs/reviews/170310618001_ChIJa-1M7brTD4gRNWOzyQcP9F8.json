The ribs, my god, the ribs shouldn\u2019t even exist. Their ribs were BURNT and stuck together with no flavor, had to use a pair of pliers to pull them apart. Ribs are supposed to fall off the bones easily. Everything tasted like gas and like the metal grill. They are not smoking their meat properly at all. You\u2019re better off walking a few extra steps to the jewel next door and getting whatever frozen bbq they have their, cheaper AND better tasting. Can\u2019t believe this place has the audacity to call whatever it serves as BBQ. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.  -An extremely disappointed Texan living in Chicago",

They actually never ended up receiving the order due to someone (who apparently no longer works there) never entered it.  So when I called the day of the rehearsal wondering where our food was, the owner answered and personally prepared and delivered our entire order immediately.  He even gave us a generous credit for his restaurant.  Given the sincere attempt to make up for the situation, and the quality of the food, Wrigley BBQ has become our go to BBQ spot.  The people there are always great.  I've gotten the ribs every time and my wife loves the pulled pork (there's always enough to take home leftovers).  And I highly recommend any of their desserts!",

I always think twice before going to a three star rated restaurant, but that shouldn't sway you from checking out Wrigley BBQ if you live in the hood.  Order at the counter and they bring it to you, BYOB, only about 15 tables and yes the old Q-uizno's chairs from other reviews are funny!  Really enjoyed the pulled pork platter $11, tender and saucy, served with one piece of white bread. Mac and Cheese side is garlicy and amazing. Whipped maple sweet potatoes were good but I was bored after two bites. Jalapeno cornbread was a little dry, coleslaw was more basic than Jewel and really soupy.  Roommate said she makes better ribs, half rack $12, they had great color, lots of meat and little fat but she didn't think they were 'fallin off the bone' enough and actually left a few bites.",

The ribs come out cold every time, the burgers are bland, and the brisket is mediocre at best. The french fries are not seasoned and the cole slaw is essentially a soup.  As for the decor, I hope you enjoy chairs purchased from a Quiznos fire sale, because that's what you'll find here. To top it off, they are regularly out of drinks, ketchup, or sauces.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how this place has over four stars. The only explanation is that anyone who likes this place has literally never been to another BBQ restaurant.  If you enjoy food, I implore you, do not waste your time with Wrigleyville BBQ.",
