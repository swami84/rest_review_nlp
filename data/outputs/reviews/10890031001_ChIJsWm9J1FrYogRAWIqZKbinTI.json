I am a former chef and foodservice professional so it's really hard for me to eat out, much to my wife's dismay. Because it's hard to \"wow\" me. A lot of great dishes on the menu, but most I am familiar with in different ways and versions. Meaning: I can't say I had it prepared EXACTLY the way they do it. BUT WHEN WE DO eat out, and its a nice romantic ambient nuanced dinner, this is a top pick in Huntsville. Not just for food alone, there is a great wine selection BUT I am most impressed by the BOURBON selection. My wife is allergic to beef, JUST BEEF, (not lamb, bison, fowl, or seafood)...so that takes away about a third of the menu currently. That is NOT a complaint, merely for your information. We like to share many small plates or appetizers (you may call them) as a meal AND even dinner plates we share. ALTHOUGH the stone crab was good, we frequent Florida because of family so the price was high for us (but we ARE in North Alabama).  We had the Seared U-8 Scallops dish, and that was great...BUT NOW the STAR for our palate was the BLACK COD, Outstanding! ...Miso glaze, forbidden rice, marinated beech mushrooms, baby bok choy... Great service, great food, great wine, excellent bourbon...we asked in our reservation for a cozier \"out of the way spot\" and that was accommodated! Thank you!",

The fish itself was foul, and the entire dish didn't feel thought-out. I'm not sure if COVID-19 has put a strain on restaurant supply chains, but that fish should have been thrown out weeks ago. The summer menu just felt lackluster. I have been a fan of Purveyor, but was disappointed with this visit.",

The atmosphere is great (except for the lack of lighting.  It's super dark in there.)  It's very expensive, but a great way to impress a date. Would go again.  2018 update (One bad experience) They were pushing the 'special' which was a prawn and a steak.  Meals at this restaurant run about $45/plate.  One would think the 'special' would be around that price or less.  Negative.  When the bill came, we found that this prawn and steak cost $93  That's not the entire bill.  That's one dish.  That's about double everything else on the menu.  I asked if it was a mistake but was told it was accurate.  I understand it's on me for not asking about the price, but I felt deceived at the price and the lack of upfront warning that it's wildly more expensive than anything else on the menu.  2020 update The service was fantastic, no surprises on the bill.  The meals were pretty good.  The side dishes were amazing (curry lentils and spaetzle), but the duck was lacking flavor.  The cocktails were great.  Will go again.",

        "caption": "Purveyor was really good! Since Miss Rona shut a lot of things down, this was the best food we've had in awhile. I also love how downtown Huntsville is coming up. This location isn't far from where I stay while I'm in HSV. It was mine and my husband's 5 year anniversary, so we went to dinner with my mom. I looked on Yelp and saw this restaurant and the food looked good so we decided to give it a try. I'm glad we stopped by, it was a great decision and the food was impressive! The set up of how this location ran was also interesting. Due to Miss Rona, they had tables set up outside, of course 6 ft apart. They had a card propped up on the table with a number to call and place your order when you are ready. The host brings you a menu. You look at the menu and decide what you want to order. You then call the number and place your order. Your order will come out in a bag and to-go packaging for you to be able to eat outside. It isn't the prettiest packaging but it works.  We ordered different entrees and shared sides & a shareable plate. Between the three of us we ordered the Old-Fashioned Burger, Bahn Mi Burger, Scallop Squid Ink Pasta, Four-Cheese Cream Spinach, Jalape\u00f1o Cream Corn, Parmesan Herb Fries, Duck Meatballs, Ponzu Brussels Sprouts, and Bread Pudding. Yes, it was a lot of food but it was all so good! We also tried drinks. I think my husband had an Old-Fashion and I had a cocktail. To be honest, their drinks aren't anything special. I wasn't impressed with the drinks as I was with the food.  Old-Fashioned Burger - REALLY GOOD! My mom had this burger. 8 oz black angus ground beef, with cheddar cheese, heirloom tomatoes, red onion, house-made pickles, mixed greens, and chipotle ginger mayo *ADD: applewood smoked bacon $3. This was good for her because she eats really healthy and tries not to eat beef but once a week. She actually really enjoyed this burger. It was huge and full of flavor. Certainly a good burger.  Bahn Mi Burger - REALLY GOOD! This burger was on the specials menu. It was like a Bahn Mi sandwich but in burger form. It was very flavorful and huge. I tried a bite of this and it was a lot but so good! It was a nice twist on a burger.  Scallop Squid Ink Pasta - GOOD! George's bank scallops, squid ink pasta, pepper, onions, huitlacoche, tito's bell pepper cr\u00e8me sauce. This dish was good. I just started coming around to eating scallops and these were good. The pasta was cooked perfect and the sauce was good.  Four-Cheese Cream Spinach - GOOD! This side dish was decent. It was seasoned well and very creamy. My only complaint about this dish was that the spinach wasn't chopped. It was left in whole pieces. This was a little different than what I'm use to.  Jalape\u00f1o Cream Corn - VERY GOOD! This was the best creamed corn I've ever had. It was seasoned well with a slight kick. It was creamy and crunchy. I loved this side dish!  Parmesan Herb Fries - VERY GOOD! These were fries cooked in rendered beef tallow and topped with Parmesan and herbs. The best seasoned fries I've had! Ahhhmazing!  Duck Meatballs - GOOD! Hudson Valley duck meatballs, tamarind & pineapple yellow curry, black truffle p\u00e2te shavings, asiago foam. This dish was different. The meatballs were good and tender. They came in a curry sauce. I'm use to meatballs being in a marinara sauce or a chili glaze. However, this was a nice twist.  Ponzu Brussels Sprouts & Pork Belly - REALLY GOOD! This dish was really good and the pork belly added some nice flavor. They were cooked perfect.  Bread Pudding - GOOD! Cinnamon condensed milk, bourbon caramel, milk chocolate mousse. We love bread pudding so it was a no brainer to try. This bread pudding was pretty good. It wasn't the best we've had but it was good. The fruit and caramel was a nice touch to it!  Overall, Purveyor was really good and we enjoyed their food. I'd certainly come back!",

Given the rest of my meals in Huntsville I wasn't expecting to be wowed when we went but I was wowed! Matt, the bartender, should open up his own bar. I had the Old Fashioned and it was one of the best drinks I've had all year and that's not an exaggeration. Matt is top level mixologist and those are a rarity. Even if you don't end up going to Purveyor for a meal, go and have Matt prepare you a drink.",
