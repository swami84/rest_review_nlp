They sent half of my order wrong, did not send dipping sauces already paid for, and when ordering through the app, it clearly stated contactless, which was not the case (they said it was a safety issue) The driver had a very nasty attitude because we told them we wanted a proper DELIVERY, at least come knock the door, we were sick and had to go out to the street to get the order. And they want to be tipped???  Unfortunately we had already tipped, since the order was made with a card and was supposed to be contactless. This branch has the worst customer service from the management down to the drivers. Save yourself the aggravation and order anywhere else.",

Then when I am at home and check my pizza that I have ordered with extra cheese .. I found out one side is with cheese but the other half they forgot to add it what is a pizza without cheese people?! Lol a disaster and is not because of lack of staff I can tell there were more than 8 employees there working and not rushing.

Called them and the nice girl on the phone had my order remade and sent out. I waited AN HOUR outside in the rain to catch the driver, and once he did come it was in a van and he sat there for 5 minutes without calling. I had to go to the car and ask if he was from dominos. He didnt even call until I got to the van and told him my name!  **PLUS, HE DROPPED SOMEONE ELSES PIZZA ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR WHILE HE GAVE US OUR ORDER. When I mentioned that to him and asked why he didnt call me, he didnt acknowledge me.  Overall from the time I ordered at 8 pm to when i finally got my pizza at around 12:15, I waited more than 4 hours!",

The app lets you know when the driver leaves, but doesn\u2019t let you know when they\u2019re close by so you can get ready to head out. Most of the time you end up waiting over 20 minutes for your order to arrive, and sometimes the employees are in a rush to leave to the next destination, but I mean with a one minute notice that you\u2019re outside you can\u2019t expect much of a rush.

So i wait another 25 minutes or so and when i ask the whomever I was speaking to about my order and how come its taking so long due to the fact that i live close distance from their location and the female who answer was rude and then hung up on me without even answer my question properly. Its enough that the pizza crust was partially uncooked and then they forget part of my order she didn't have to hang up on me.

I ordered around 8:21 PM and it was prepared by 8:38 PM as per the tracker but food left from the store at 9:34 PM. They literally didn't dispatch for an hour. Since then it took an hour and half to get it delivered to my building and guess what - it's 5 minutes driving distance as per Google maps. O tried to cancel my order so many times in between calling the store but they NEVER PICK UP!  I reached out to corporate and figured they don't have any control on the stores and hence we the customers suffer.  @dominos please close this store.",

So when you guys are giving your attitude to these workers for their service i think you should re direct that energy to the corporation if you want a different outcome. They\u2019ve given the franchise a makeover with these new stores but they aren\u2019t supplying them with enough workers to meet the demand.

        "caption": "Customers beware!!!!! Shame on Webster Avenue Domino's in the Bronx. They've  disappointed my mother, stepfather, my two boys and I, one to many times. They have often messed up our orders, brought our food late and brought us burned items but because my family loves it, I let it slide, didn't complain and continued to order from them. My family, friends and I have ordered alot of pizza, wings and bread from this place over the years, especially for super bowl parties. I am so livid and done with this place. I advise you all, if you are going to order with them, never ever use your credit or debit card with them. Give cash on delivery and have exact change if you order from them. Oh and check your order before the driver pulls off always. I ordered a St. Jude pizza deal for my family in the first week of December with my debit card. My order $35.86 and was supposed to arrive in 45 minutes.  Two hours after I placed my order, the online tracker said my meal had arrived. Lies!  We were still waiting for our meal.  I have a 10 year old son with autism that harassed me because he wanted his pepperoni pizza and parmesan bites. He wound up having a meltdown aka tantrum because he was hungry and wanted pizza. I tried to appease him and tried to get him to eat something else while we waited but my son was not trying to hear he still had to wait. I called the store multiple times with the phone ringing over ten minutes with no answer. When I finally got a live person, they said they never got an order for me. Then they said I gave them the wrong address so the driver brought my order back to the store. That was such bullcrap because, I had proof of my online order and we have been using the same address and phone number for years. I ordered online frequently and often earned my free pizza reward. Plus my info is stored in the system and has not changed. I said I want my order delivered in ten minutes or forget my order and reverse the charges and put my money back in my account. The guy I was communicating with, (I won't say his name, the name he gave me) said \"we can't get the order to you in ten minutes\". The pizza spot is a three minute drive to my home. I could walk there in about ten minutes. I asked why the driver could not get my order back to me in ten minutes or less and he said we just can't do that, no other explanation was given. FYI, record your communication because they will lie. I canceled my order and he assured me that the charges would be reversed. I wound up having to order my family's meal from a local pizza spot on Courtlandt Avenue. We got our order in 3O minutes. This guy rode a bike, got off, parked his bike and met me at my lobby door plus that pizza spot is further than the Domino's. Go figure \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd I filed an email complaint and I have yet to receive a reply. Plus I am still waiting on my money to be placed back into my account. Oh and another thing. The delivery drivers never get out the car to bring the food to me. I am not asking the driver to get out the car, come into my building, get on the elevator and bring it to my apartment door. Nor am I asking for him to meet me in the lobby of my building by the elevator. I don't need him to come into the building.  I simply ask and plead with them to bring the pizza to the lobby door, where I am standing  outside of the building, using my back to hold the door open so that my hands are free.  They refuse to get out the car. I tell them it is difficult for me to get back in, if I let the door go since I'm going to be holding onto the multiple boxes and a two liter soda. They don't care.  I always have to let the door go, go get the food and head back to the door that is now closed and locked. So now I either have to get someone outside to help me, pray someone will be coming out the buildling soon or put the food on the ground to gain entry because my hands aren't free.  They are  not courteous, chilvarous or compassionate.  Everyone else that delivers to us.",

The best of all is that I get my money back in a week, according to what the person who answered the phone said, if I had known before, I would better buy from Little Caesars. Terrible service !!

Today might be the last time i order Dominos at least from this location so that i dont have to be serviced from this store. I am a loyal customer who orders Dominos almost every weekend. Years ago i had an issue about an order that came in all scattered and cold and stopped ordering and never took anything free that was offered to me because i dont care about free stuff. I like to pay the prize so i can get a good service and always give a good tip to the drivers. So i started ordering again and every week its something. One week they forgot the soda, then the bbq sauce or the pizza came in cold and dry or it never came and they refunded after i waited hours but tonight they texted me at 9pm saying it was on the way but then at 10:20 pm the driver calls and when i got outside the driver gave m order to someone else who i saw walking into the building with my order and even help opening the door. Like really! This stored should be closed  because of all the stupid mistakes they make.

Today might be the last time i order Dominos at least from this location so that i dont have to be serviced from this store. I am a loyal customer who orders Dominos almost every weekend. Years ago i had an issue about an order that came in all scattered and cold and stopped ordering and never took anything free that was offered to me because i dont care about free stuff. I like to pay the prize so i can get a good service and always give a good tip to the drivers. So i started ordering again and every week its something. One week they forgot the soda, then the bbq sauce or the pizza came in cold and dry or it never came and they refunded after i waited hours but tonight they texted me at 9pm saying it was on the way but then at 10:20 pm the driver calls and when i got outside the driver gave m order to someone else who i saw walking into the building with my order and even help opening the door. Like really! This stored should be closed  because of all the stupid mistakes they make. I am sure i am not the only one who thinks the same as i have seen other reviews and also seen it in person one time i decided to go get my order and came across a big line of people who also ordered online.

And the worst part, i called them the first time and a lady picked up the call, I asked is it \"Luis\", she says he is not working today and took the details(Mob no) and just kept me on hold for ever. Second time, she took the details and started saying that the details were incorrect and thats the reason the order was not delivered(then, why update in the system, its delivered?) and then when i said i see everything fine, she admits and says the address is correct on the order and keeps on hold again, forever. Third time she picks up the call, takes the details and keeps on hold again, forever.

I initially started calling around 10pm, to see about my order, to which no one ever answered the phone. I called all the way up to 1:30AM, keep in mind the food was already paid for. On January 2nd, 2018 I start calling them around 9AM, all the way up to after 4PM, to which still no one answered the phone. So when I got off work, I headed to Dominos on 1351 Webster Ave to get to the bottom of the situation. Once there I waited ten minutes to see if any of the employees would greet me or take my order. Which to my surprise no one ever did. I start to say 'hello is anyone going to greet the customers,\" yet still no response all while the manager stood off to the side.... to the extant where no one would even acknowledge the constant ringing coming from their busy phone. A man who worked there left out the store, but then returned and asked me \"did anyone come to help you?\" then went back and conversed with the manager, the manager then in return sent out a young girl. My response was \"no offense but you can't help me, I need to speak with the manager.\" I continued to ask \"Why isn't anyone answering the phone, which is still ringing?!\" And then young lady returned to the manager to inform her that a customer (me) would like to speak to her. Jump forward a few minutes and the manager, Nadia Miller, approached me with attitude from the start. She was very unprofessional, no hospitality what so ever. It was an ongoing back and forth between us, in which, and I quote, she said \"We had over 300 orders and we cannot service everyone.\" \"Why don't you go home and turn on your stove,\" I then proceeded to tell her I was going to report her, in which her response was \"You can report me to Donald Trump for all I care.\" A general manager, the face of the Dominos, these are the types of people Dominos HQ have at their frontline? I won't be ordering from that Dominos ever again.... THE WORST. They deserve no stars. They just lost a very loyal customer, especially when the staff can say they don't care.",

I placed an order in the Domino\u2019s app, which said it would take an hour and 50 minutes to receive. Of course, this is a lot more time than anyone would like to wait, but it was understood due to a busy day. However, I tried calling when 2 hours passed and the pizza was still not even in the oven, according to the app\u2019s tracker. No one picked up the phone for 20+ minutes. Then the call dropped (actually sounded like someone picked up and hung up).  2 and a half hours pass and I try to just cancel, but the app didn\u2019t give me the option, and I couldn\u2019t reach anyone on the phone, of course.  Finally I get a call from the delivery guy over 3 hours later. At this point, I no longer want the pizza because half the guests left to grab something to eat elsewhere.  I was well aware that it wasn\u2019t the delivery guy\u2019s fault since the pizza had not even be ready. So I politely ask if the \u201c30 minutes or it\u2019s free\u201d Dominos policy, is applied in any way when you go over the estimated delivery by over an hour. He laughed for a while and said \u201cI don\u2019t know what policy you\u2019re talking about\u201d (staff should be educated in well known Domino\u2019s policies). He later said \u201cyou want your food or nah?\u201d. After I said \u201conly if the policy applies\u201d, he laughed again and hung up.  This isn\u2019t the first issue I have with the store. It is clearly and ongoing issue based on all the other reviews. Domino\u2019s should just force close this store front.",

They told me that they would go back to the store to get the wings and that they would deliver it straight back. Like what!? I thought everyone has a check list before it goes out to be delivered so things like this wouldn't happen. No we have to wait for the wings to be delivered so we can enjoy both pizza and wings together. SMH!!! This is the second time something like this happened to me at this location. The first bad experience was worse, I ordered at 8pm and fell asleep and woke up at 12am with no missed calls or nothing. When I called after 12am they then told me that they haven't even put in the order. Ughhhh!!! I had to call corporate and do a whole bunch of everything else because as a paying customer that contributes to this business in my neighborhood, I feel that they should be a little more careful in the way they treat the customers and making sure the services are good .
