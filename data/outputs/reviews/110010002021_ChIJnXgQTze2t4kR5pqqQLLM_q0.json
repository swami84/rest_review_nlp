It's actually 2 restaurants in 1 location:  Ledo Pizza and Casbah Cafe.   On the Casbah menu,  I've tried the lamb shank that is melt in your mouth awesomeness served with cous cous that reminds me of tagines in France. Beef kofta,  fattoush salad,  hummus, falafel,  etc., are all perfect too.   I've also tried the chicken parm which hit the spot but really the Casbah menu is much better.   And the prices are serious bargains for the area.   I'm scared people will find out about this gem and I will have to wait in line.",

But this getaway place shouldn't have been, because the food and service were respectively home-made delicious and honest. The dishes we ordered were recommended traditional ones and were overall satisfying especially because of the sauces! Perfectly reasonable place to grad some quick falafel from the Georgetown campus. In the end, it was the perfectly crafted almond caramel cake dessert that really stole the show! I don't even really like caramel and I am still thinking about this amazing caramel sauce...",
