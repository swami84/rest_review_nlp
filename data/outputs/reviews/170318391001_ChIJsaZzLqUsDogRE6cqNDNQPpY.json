I picked out the tofu and tossed everything else.  We also bought two orders of the Fresh Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls.  These offer a much better value for your money -- two well stuffed rolls for $7.  But something strange occurred: only one of our four rolls  contained fresh basil.  I asked them about this and was told they typically don't put basil in their rolls. So this means the basil we found was mistakenly put in that one roll.  We liked the basil.  It gave the roll character beyond the nice texture.  Simply Thalia should consider putting it in their rolls --on purpose.",

However when it came back the replacement was even harder! I wish I was exaggerating. She took it off my bill so that was cool. I don't get the impression that she believed me, though.

The rice was jasmine instead of Japanese sticky rice. My boyfriend had the pad Thai. It almost tasted like it was curry with peanuts. Strange would be a kind way to describe the food here. Please don't punish yourself by coming here.",

But there's usually one or two for the entire place. At times they get a surge of people coming in and so they get a bit behind. Be patient, they'll get to you and help you as best as they can. I have only been there after work hours, 5pm and on. But when I go they still have lunch specials posted and happy hour. They look delish! Now on to the dishes! I use to stick to the pad thai the first couple of times but boy have I been missing out! Just yesterday we ordered a New Yorker sushi maki and a Full Moon sushi roll. Both were delicious, light but filling and very tasty. I also ordered the Panang Curry with chicken. Wow!!! Incredible dish! The best you'll ever have! I haven't found anything like it! I'm obsessed! The prefect balance of spiciness and sweetness. Loved that it had peanut sauce! The amount of pieces of chicken and peppers was just right. I mixed spoonfuls of rice with just the sauce, so flavorful! My sister ordered the Crazy Noodle, I was so blown away by my dish I didn't get to try it but it did look great! She mentioned she loved how thin and well cooked the noodles were and definitely loved the sweet sauce that came on the side. Sweet but not to sweet that it feels like you are eating sugar. I must say they have a perfect balance of spices in their dishes. Pad thai is very good too! They do over do it with the fresh bean sprouts to fill the plate, in any dish that contains beans sprouts, but you can just let them know you want then to go easy on it and you are good. Overall, a must try restaurant. Must try the sushi, unlike anything you've tried anywhere else.",

Eating here I've had the Peking Duck over Rice and The Roast Duck & Wonton Ramen. Both are delicious and next up will be the Roast Duck Bunh Mi. (It's rare I get Duck so I plan on trying it all before I get the rest of the menu which, I do plan to eventually get through all of it.)  For those on a budgetary concern they have some awesome and SUPER affordable $5 lunch specials. (So affordable you can afford 2 and almost might want to!) Honestly if they were a couple blocks closer I'd be tempted to buy lunch here once a week.  They also have a slew of Sushi options that sound delicious though I haven't had a chance to try yet.  Simply Thalia is simply delicious and so far with their menu you can't go wrong!",

Its a small and cozy environment and its not open very late but its never full either. A great sushi during the day or right after work spot.",
