We ordered the garlic shrimp and where amazed at how awesome it was. They are grilled and have an amazing garlic/grill fusion taste to it that was unexpected and memorable. This place comes highly recommended and offered a more memorable shrimp experience than some of the other more well-established shrimp establishments on Oahu.",
