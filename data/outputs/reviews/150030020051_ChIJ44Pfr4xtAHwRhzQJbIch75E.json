The pancake souffle options are all amazing, my personal favorites are the blueberry souffle and the banana souffle. The customer service is excellent and the interior and outdoor exterior is decorated so intricately. There is always a fresh tiny flower on every table. Not only is the presentation of the food absolutely beautiful but it always tastes delicious. It is located at the bottom of the Monarch Hotel and there is parking in the building that is free with validation. By far the best breakfast place ever!",

To add insult to injury they couldn't even get our order right, I only ate what they gave me because it took 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES TO GET ME A CREPE. They also asked us if we were okay twice the whole time. Absolutely terrible, everything about this place. Thinking if making it a photo op?

We said we didn\u2019t mind being outside but that was before the sun was fully risen; so we both we\u2019re sweating in our seats early on (no coverings)  We got our menus and waters relatively quick. We looked them over... for about 10 minutes untill a server came back over to take our order. I asked what certain things were and he explained them. I ordered something (blueberry fluffy pancake) and then changed my mind when I realized I could get the sauce (caramel) on the side since I\u2019m not a fan of it, but I wanted the bananas (banana fluffy pancake). We also ordered the (strawberry fluffy pancake) and teas. And then we ordered a potato side (there are 2) since the pancakes didn\u2019t look too big in size. Waiter never told us one wasn\u2019t available.  So our food comes out a bit later and he never scratched off the blueberry one so we had 3 pancakes come out, but luckily the runner took the blueberry one back with no issue. I look down and the caramel sauce is all around the edges of the the plate, covering my bananas... but the runner was already gone.  Also, the potato side we ordered came out with the hash-brown version, when we asked for the seasoned potatoes.  No one came over to ask us how our food was, except for a busser walking by with her hands full, asking if we were alright. Time went by and i was really hungry at this point, so I ate the pancake, but no fruit. The potatoes were not what we ordered, nor did we like them or eat them. I couldn\u2019t even eat half of my $16.50 dish.  We stopped the same busser again as she refilled our water and told her that our orders were incorrect. She said ok let me go tell your waiter. She Never came back and our waiter didn\u2019t come out. 20 minutes AFTER we put our forks down, the waiter comes over with the check. We told him the issues with our food and he told us they didn\u2019t have the potatoes we ordered... uh ok (well if we knew that, we wouldn\u2019t have ordered any?) He realized he messed up with the caramel and took it off our bill. We tipped generously even though we were there for TWO HOURS and our orders were wrong. We waited a while for most of the services.. ie. bring us our bill, check in on us, and to correct our dishes.  Overall poor customer service, no shade on the patio, and the food was just \u2018ok\u2019. Most likely won\u2019t ever go again, especially if there is a line. It just is not worth it.  Gave two stars for the pancakes being alright (it was my first time with souffl\u00e9 pancakes and It was very egg-y which was odd tasting but explains the fluff)",

A beautiful rainbow was visible from that place, and he kindly told me, \"There is a saying that if you see a rainbow, you can come to Hawaii again.\" And it was worth walking. The salmon egg benedict is the best. After that, I ate Eggs Benedict at other stores, but I haven't come across anything that exceeds Eggs Benedict in the cream pot.

The three stars are that the parking lot and the desk were rattling, or I could not distinguish between pancakes and pancakes (-_-;)  (Original) \u59bb\u304c\u30d1\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30cf\u30ef\u30a4\u3060\u3068\u6b64\u51e6\u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f\u306f\u3053\u306e\u624b\u306e\u5e97\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002iPOD\u3068\u304b\u30a8\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u3068\u304b\u30d2\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3\u30d3\u30ec\u30c3\u30b8\u524d\u306e\u9589\u5e97\u3057\u305f\u5e97\u3068\u304b\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u6b64\u51e6\u306f\u99d0\u8eca\u5834\u306f\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u3060\u304c\u3001\u6b64\u306e\u5b89\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u99d0\u8eca\u5834\u5165\u308a\u53e3\u306f\u6025\u5742\u3067\u51fa\u5165\u308a\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002 \u5927\u4f53\u3001\u5b89\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\u306f\u3053\u3093\u306a\u4f5c\u308a\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3002  \u6b64\u306e\u5e97\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u304c\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u89b3\u5149\u5ba2\u3067\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3060\u304c\u3001\u7c73\u56fd\u8cc7\u672c\u3060\u3068\u3001\u300c\u53c8\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u304b\u30fb\u30fb\u300d\u3063\u3066\u611f\u3058\u304c\u6709\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u5e97\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u826f\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002 \u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u89b3\u5149\u5ba2\u304c\u6765\u308b\u51e6\u306f\u7e41\u76db\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3000\u6765\u306a\u3044\u51e6\u306f\u9589\u5e97\u30ac\u30e9\u30ac\u30e9\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002  \u661f\uff13\u3064\u306f\u3001\u99d0\u8eca\u5834\u3068\u3001\u673a\u304c\u30ac\u30bf\u30ac\u30bf\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3068\u304b\u3001\u79c1\u306b\u306f\u30d1\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3068\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u533a\u5225\u304c\u3064\u304b\u306a\u3044\u4e8b\u3060(-_-;)",

The ambience is very pleasant and relaxing. Many of the decorations are antiques so they've asked that no photos be taken of the decor. But inside the decor makes it feel like a fairy tale. The food was amazing. The souffle pancakes were not overly sweet And it was not a heavy dish. They were very light and fluffy. The eggs benedict with the lacy potato cakes were savory with salmon that was to die for. My only regret is not being able to go a second time and trying different food. I would highly recommend this little hidden treasure.",

The souffle pancake had a strong foamy feeling, and it was a pwanpwan. As soon as you cut it with a fork, it collapses. However, the dough was a bit cold and warm, and I felt that instead of baking after ordering, I reheated the pre-baked one again. In fact, it was delivered about 5 minutes after ordering, so it probably is not baking from scratch. The good thing was that they accepted me in spite of coming to the store just before the last order, and the clerks were all kind. However, the price was a little unknown. Is this price even if you add consumption tax and tip? At that height, a little doubt remained.

Because it was breakfast, we ordered omelet of three kinds of cheese. Tomato and basil are also included, but mostly cheese. Comes with rice and salad so it was easy to eat!  The inside of the shop is decorated with cute motifs such as angels and laces, and it is definitely not Hawaiian like the word of mouth (laughs) There are staff who can speak Japanese, and they speak very carefully even if they are not there, so there is no problem ordering! At first I was asked if I could only use cash but it was good. However, the sisters in the next seat seemed to have only a card, so they negotiated and used the card. It seems that it can be used at any time.  For drinks, I asked for a cappuccino, my husband had a hot tea. Cappuccino wasn't so good ... not so bad. The tea had a bad smell and was not delicious (^ _ ^;).  I went around 7 o'clock on weekdays, so I was vacant without being lined up. I was comfortable! It was delicious, but it was too expensive (about 3,000 yen per person) even if the service charge was included. If asked by a friend, I think it would be cheaper to eat delicious souffle pancakes in Tokyo.

I was surprised by the souffle pancakes -- originally I'd discovered them in Japan, but Cream Pot's are better. By chance we struck up a conversation with the owner, who explained that the souffle pancake craze actually started here over decade ago.  The decor in Cream Pot is beautiful (my wife said it reminded her of a Ghibli film), and the service was excellent. As a lover of breakfast food I can firmly say this is some of the best I've ever had. We'll be back whenever we're in Waikiki.",

Husband had French toast and it wasn\u2019t cooked all the way through, the banana was good though. He also ordered orange juice and there was so much ice in the tall skinny glass that there was about 2 ounces of actual orange juice in it.

Took my partner and my mother for brunch one morning, and we all ended up listing this as one of the best places we stopped for food during our week-long trip.  We each ordered something different, so we could get a sense for the full menu - souffle pancake for Mom, a savory crepe for me, and an eggs Benedict for my partner, served on a bed of sushi rice instead of an English muffin.  He was not originally going to try it, as he doesn't tend to like raw tuna (much prefers salmon), but I pointed out that, of all places he's going to get it, it probably won't be as fresh as Hawaii. So he ordered and loved it. He still talks about it, and all other Eggs Benedict options have paled in comparison for him.",

It might be a little tricky to find so pay careful attention.  Walking in, it reveals this large white space that's more in the old school style type of house with enough seating but could probably pack up when crowded. The waiters are pretty attentive but lack a bit of warmth. They are forever dressed like chefs. They are pretty good at taking your orders or coming back when you need some time.  For our orders, we started with some coffee. The gf got the cafe latte and I got the cream pot Vietnamese style coffee. Both coffees are actually not that great. Poor attempt at both. As an avid coffee drinker, the Vietnamese coffee is bland, no strong flavor and even has watered down taste. Little bit of sweet cream was placed on top for presentation but for the size and taste that was given... $6 is over priced. The latter is exactly the same as it taste watered down. My coffee machine at home has stronger flavors.  When it comes to the food, we got the Maguro and the off the wall Egg Benedict. One of the egg was overcooked as no yolk poured out of it. The maguro has two slice of fish layered over the egg, sitting a bed of burned rice. The sauce was either some kind of soy sauce... good idea but poor execution. Nothing stood out that valued the dish to $20... exact same with the other egg Benedict. The other one is a French bread, with the egg on top and covered with 2 small slice of bacon and covered in syrup... same thing, not anything worth $20 and it was just going to ihop or Denny's and ordering those same items... which would be even cheaper.  Overall, I'd give this place a 2/5 stars. Service was good and the atmosphere was relaxing but that's about it. On Hawaii, I can go to the beach to get that and it's free. The food was definitely not high end like it was portrayed. It is definitely overpriced and not worth it, at least for the eggs Benedict, which leads to me to think for the other items. The souffl\u00e9 pancakes are something we were considering trying but at this point, I'm already thinking it might not be worth the $17 that they want to charge.... I would probably not come back at this point.",

This place is a place, and the parking lot is a hotel (Hawaii Monarch Hotel), so it is difficult to drive because the entrance clerk is hard to stop.  The place is along the canal, and there is an entrance on the canal on the first floor of the Hawaiian Monarch Hotel.  This store is rated as a stylish shop by women, and went to eat several times with pancakes and egg benedicts, but it is delicious. The desks and chairs at that time were hard to eat because they were rattling whether the floor was inclined or the desks and chairs were bad.

However, the wife of the owner brought in the slip and only the total amount is shown as \"service charge included\". (The upper part of the document was collapsed) After that, I told him that I would like to pay with a card at the cash register, and I was told that it would be 5% off if it was cash, so I paid in cash. After I went to the store, I was worried about it and calculated that the amount paid was \"meal fee + 18% (actual chip fee)\". By the way, I did not get a receipt. That means that the actual price of the slip was an additional 5% over the \"meal fee + tip fee 18%\" ...? In that case, the bill will be much higher than the market price, so some doubts remain. It seems that it is a measure to be paid by cash. Although the food service market in Waikiki is not cheap, there is a tourist plus plus alpha with a volume and atmosphere that is good for that part, but this is something that remains unreliable when taken. Most of them are Japanese customers, especially young women, but there were other people like me who turned their head in the shop, and I feel that they will not continue if I use this method when I can send them via SNS. To do. If you're just using a vague word such as \"It's a service fee,\" why can't you pay the card neatly and not say 18% of the tips? I was disappointed that I felt like I was being deceived strangely, although I could still be convinced to pay. It is a disappointing place though it is delicious.

Once we walked up to the sliding glass entry door, we were immediately greeted and given a nice table with views of the canal. We ordered the mixed berries souffle pancakes and baked eggs with shrimp. Both were equally good with the pancakes getting the slight edge for uniqueness. Service was also fast and friendly.

Mango's lassi (forgotten) has a lighter taste than it is. The shop was also fashionable, it was Saturday morning, but it was not lined up. Enter from the corner of the building. There were some tourists who looked like myself, but there were many people who came alone to eat. The entrance is also planted and has a good atmosphere.

They serve a special take on breakfast that includes soufle pancakes that are served with a variety of different fruits (strawberries or mixed berries are my favourites) and accompanied by whipped cream. The pancakes ate so light and fluffy and I really haven't come across anything like them. There can be a bit if a wait someone's but don't let that put you off. The wait is well worth it and the food is always incredible. I have never between dissapointed yet",

I should have read the reviews prior to going because it was just as the 1-2 star reviews described...over priced and just average tasting food and the worst part is how they sneak in 18%  automatic tip so if you're not careful, you'll tip them twice....so decieving.  We we seated at a small table that was not stable and slanting to one side, so we saw an open table next to it and sat down there only to be told by the owner that we can't sit there because it was a table for 4 and directed to move and sit at the table we were at even after mentioning that the table was rocking and leaning to one side.  He didnt offer us another table either.  I wanted to this day to be special for my mom so stayed hoping that the food would make up for this inconvenience.  It did not.  We were so disappointed especially when the bill came...ridiculously priced and we were still hungry after we finished.  We had ordered one of thier specials, omlette with organic chicken and spinach...very bland with hardly any chicken in it, and berry soufle pancakes which was just okay.  I wish i had read the reviews prior to going about thier automatic tip on the bill.  We did not notice it and tipped them again, so they got double tipped.

Certainly the price is a bit expensive but ... I could not use the card, but I was able to explain in advance before entering the store, so I was not bothered The clerk also had some people who could speak Japanese, so I could relax and have a meal. There is also a picture of the menu and it is easy to imagine The Ala Moana Center was just the right distance for a walk after a meal.

There was no sugar in the coffee and I told the staff but it was ignored but it was a service charge. Photo of receipt of mystery. I have no idea what the cost is. $ 60 for one cup of coffee with two pancakes! why! There are a lot of fees I can not understand. The chip turned off. Because there is a service charge already. I am billed. Aren't you? This store. In addition to the tip is to write on the receipt. The taste is marmar. The amount is small. Even if you look at the receipt, it is unclear. A shop for friendly Japanese tourists. The problem is that the management of the store is not conscientious.  It is unclear accounting. Two people for breakfast and over $ 60 for pancakes and drinks! In addition to the fee, it is billed by putting it on a heap. I do not know even if you look at the receipt because it is so funny. Priceless receipts. There is a field for writing a tip on top of that, although there are a lot of service fees on your own. I rejected the chip but I would like to see how much the credit is charged. If you put a chip on top of this, let's say this store for a moment. Pancakes themselves are not bad, but if you are a Kansai, uncle is a few times better. If two people think that it is nearly 7,000 yen from morning, it will wither. You should stop it. If you leave this kind of restaurant that can do it at a huge price, the food and drink in Waikiki will become even higher. People must not enter the store unless the price is reasonable. This store is overkill.

Again, portions are small for what you are paying because it's all Japanese sized portions. if you are looking for a nice breakfast cafe to fill you up and not break the bank, I would NOT recommend here. It was nice to experience the place but I can say that I won't be back..

The restaurant will charge you $2 for the parking and give you a validation sticker.

As with most restaurants in this area the food is rather expensive but also freshly made and very well prepared. We had the salmon benedict and salmon omelttle which was very nice. The best part is the atmosphere and environment which feels to be out of a nursery rhyme or childhood story. It's a mix of Victorian and rustic design which can definitely keep you busy while you wait for your food (ie I spy with the kids). The food was very unique as well. We tried a potato based soup which we didn't like and was quite bland but we liked that they seemed to enjoy expirementing with different reciepes and had some very unique offerings. Overall great spot to go especially if you are visiting from out of town.",

They hide the fact that they automatically include a 18% gratuity to all bills (this is for all guests, not large parties).  They hide this fact, then on the bill there is a nice line for a tip....so they area asking for a second tip in addition to the one they humbly added without your permission.  The food was fair, not the best I've had here, but the sneaky way that they try to get a double really left a bad taste in my mouth.

The souflee is slightly salty and brings a taste of eggs, so basically it was like eating omelet with fruit. Note that there is mandatory 18% charge for the service. Further, they asked me to just sign the receipt and since I am new to this system I didn't know I had to specify not to add additional tip (since they already charged us 18%), and what was my surprise that they took advantage of my mistake and ADDED ANOTHER 15% tip once I left the restaurant. It was infuriating. Seriously, it\u2019s ridiculous paying 60 USD for a very small breakfast for two people and some bad iced coffee! Definitely not worth it.",

The entrance is on the Lobby level. Cream Pot is a small restaurant. The seating is somewhat limited. When coming at peak time expect a wait. The d\u00e9cor inside is very nice with lots little things the owners collected. The menu is small with mostly breakfast items. I like the sweet side of the menu much better. Especially the Souffl\u00e9 pancakes, is very very nice, big, puffy and tasty. The service is okay. Because the kitchen is upstairs you may have to wait a bit after placing your order at peak time. The portions are little on the small side compare to other places. However, it\u2019s very yummy. \ud83d\ude0a Overall it is a nice beautiful place to have breakfast and chat with your friends when you are not in a hurry and very hungry.  Note: Like the other review said \u201cno picture of the decors.\u201d However, when we asked the owner if we can take picture of our party. He told us we are welcome to take picture of our party and the food. He just doesn't want people walking around in the restaurant while other parties are eating to take picture of all decors. I think that is fair.",

I went there after 7am and it was vacant, but it was full at 8am. I ordered strawberry pancakes, French toast, latte and tea. It's a cute shop. The next day I came to the store and ate an omelet. A salty fluffy omelet. It comes with rice and salad. Did you want ketchup? Wait for about 20 minutes, probably because it's baked after ordering everything. I can forgive you because it's a cute shop (laughs) Two people pay about 5,000 yen. Perhaps because of the weak yen, prices are too high in Hawaii.

Second off they don't split checks, they include gratuity, they don't 100% validate your parking ticket only give you a discount and they include your parking on your bill. They also charge you $3 for their poor excuse of toast which really are really 4 tiny baguette chips. This place is ridiculous and don't recommend it unless you like being ripped off.",

French toast improves the taste of baguette texture  It's going to be a good day ^-^  (Original) \u30d1\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3088\u3046\u3063\u3066\u3053\u3068\u3067\u30b3\u30aa\u30ea\u30ca\u304b\u3089\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u8eca\u3067\u307b\u307c1\u6642\u9593\u3002 \u904b\u826f\u304f\u30c6\u30e9\u30b9\u5e2d\u304c\u7a7a\u3044\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3059\u3050\u306b\u7740\u5e2d\u3002 \u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u98a8\u304c\u5f37\u3081\u3067\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u5931\u6557\u304b\u3002  \u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306f\u307e\u3060\u6765\u306a\u3044\u3002  \u65e5\u5dee\u3057\u3092\u906e\u308b\u305f\u3081\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3057\u3066\u308b\u3068 \u6b21\u3005\u3068\u6599\u7406\u304c\u5230\u7740\u3002  \u8a55\u5224\u306e\u30d1\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306f\u7518\u3055\u304c\u7a0b\u3088\u304f\u50d5\u3067\u3082\u3044\u304f\u3089\u3067\u3082\u5165\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3002 \u8868\u9762\u306e\u9999\u3070\u3057\u3055\u3068\u4e2d\u306e\u3075\u3093\u308f\u308a\u611f\u304c\u7d76\u5999\u3002  \u30aa\u30e0\u30ec\u30c4\u306f\u666e\u901a\u304b\u306a( ^\u03c9^ ) \u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u77e5\u3089\u305a\u3001\u30c8\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u983c\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002  \u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306f\u9178\u5473\u304c\u7a0b\u3088\u304fgu! \u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c1\u30c8\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u30d0\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u98df\u611f\u304c\u7f8e\u5473\u3055\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7  \u826f\u3044\u4e00\u65e5\u306b\u306a\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059^ - ^",

They were very busy and we waited quite a while until a waiter realized that we were waiting to order. They were working so fast, moving around sooo quickly on the busy floor and responded very professionally. To be honest, that restlessness made me somehow anxious and uncomfortable.

Price is not cheap ( for 2 people with coffee, 2 dishes and desert, $40-50, most like other nice breakfast places in Hawaii) but worth it to try. Great service, and when I asked for table near window with sunlight, they were happy to change for me. No photography inside the restaurant, and I totally understand.
