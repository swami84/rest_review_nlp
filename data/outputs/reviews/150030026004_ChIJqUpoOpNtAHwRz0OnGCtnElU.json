They serve complimentary fresh baked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar  I'm not a big tomato fan, but the Bruschetta was a delicious and refreshing appetizer.  The Lobster Ravioli is a must try. It's perfectly balanced with fresh lobster and creamy white sauce.  I had the Hazelnut Ice cream for dessert and it's basically the best gelato I've ever had. Think about Nutella Icecream!  The owner Fabrizio, originally from Roma, and is one of the nicest people I've met on the island, very personable. He even escorted us out!  I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back!  Mahalos, Fabrizio and staff for the amazing experience!  Photo credit goes to Paul Millar",

I truly was excited to try this place but everything was lackluster, other than the bread you are provided when you sit down but even that and waters took 10+ mins. Chicken Picatta seemed a bit rubbery and since it was all cut up not sure if it was a fresh breast, first time ever that I've seen served like that and wife's meal was just ok, but then ok is a frozen italian dinner. The place seems run down rather than homey, well we learned not to trust previous reviews so much, gentleman that served us barely checked on us and took almost 30 mins to pay once the bill was at the table. Very disappointed",

There are plenty of squid, shrimp, shellfish and fish, and the taste is steeped in, so it's really delicious. And the pasta of Aragosta (lobster) is also great. You can choose your favorite noodles for pasta. You can choose your favorite bottle of wine from the wine space at the back of the store. It may be advantageous than glass wine. The atmosphere of the shop is calming down like a home. The shop closes relatively early, and a bit unfriendly waitress is sometimes a scratch, but it is tempting to eat the excellent Italian food that chefs from Naples create.

You can choose a percentage of the tip yourself, and this is the first time that you have filled it out and handed a slip. I can't speak English very well, so I guess I was licked. The service is not good, there is no drink menu and there are few wine choices. When I said that it was strange that the tip was filled in without permission, I said that I made excuses, but I felt the worst. On the last night in Hawaii, I took the trouble to walk I took my child with me and it made me feel terrible. Please be aware that Japanese people are more likely to get bogged down depending on their English proficiency. The food tastes like Tabelog 3 in Japan.
