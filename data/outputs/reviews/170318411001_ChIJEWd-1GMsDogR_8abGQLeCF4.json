Seems like it's an industry policy so this is no different than another karaoke spot I've been to, we would be essentially hurried out of the private room immediately when time is up, not allowing us to finish a song.  Sound from the speakers is good. Room service is quick and convenient at a press of a button. Lighting is great.",

Even if you do not drink alcohol, you need an ID card to enter. It is a feeling of chinese-style cha-lang and it is visited by people of various nationalities regardless of country. The karaoke rental costs $ 35 an hour and includes 18% tips. For non-Chinese people it is very difficult to find songs. Unlike Korean karaoke, it does not control the height of songs and it is very difficult to search for songs in Korean and Japanese.

The atmosphere is a great blend of laidback and energetic, and the overall aesthetics the place is very nice. The food was decent for bar food and the drink selection was a nice mix of familiar and new.  As for the song collection, they have a good mix of Western and Eastern artists. They have most if not all of the classics, and a few cherrypicked songs from less mainstream artists/bands.  If you\u2019re not fluent in Chinese, then the navigation for the karaoke machine can get a little frustrating. But the attendant there will be more than happy to show you.The staff working there were very attentive and friendly.  Overall, I more than enjoyed my basic, and I can\u2019t wait to return!",

We said we were going to just have a drink. After a minute of choppy conversation with the young woman behind the bar, we negotiated the ability to just have a drink at the bar. (Originally she told us we couldn't do that, then after negotiations she said \"the boss isn't here so I guess it's ok\"). Drinks on the menu are $10 and are made with the help of a Google search as the young lady needed to look up every drink on their menu. Where they got us is when we ordered off menu they charged $15 per drink for the same alcohol used on their menu. Either this isn't a legitimate business or they just take advantage of non-asians.

The staff was very accommodating while I waited for my group with a delicious martini. Being that it was during the week, the place was pretty empty which left the staff to be attentive to our group. Once we left the bar area to our private room, I was shown how to operate the monitor which is not in English but not hard to navigate. Would have been 5 stars if Sakura started my 2 hour private time once all my guests arrived, especially since we didn't have a reservation and it was no one else there. Overall I loved it and I will return.",

I asked if this was always the case, and he said yes. NO IT IS NOT. Since July of last year. I have never been told nor paid an entry fee or a \"minimum\".  It was late so we figured we would stay, since we all will Fri k at least $25 worth in booze. Once we were seated they gave us each 2 \"drink tickets\". The price on the menu for the drinks were $10-13. They wanted TWO drink tickets for a martini! So a $13 drink ticket ended up coming out to be $25.  This is by far the WORST way to build a business. I feel like we were scammed. If I could rate ZERO STARS I would!",

What made it awkward was we kept waiting for our credit cards to be returned to us so he just was watching us sitting there waiting while the door was open and it was loud. If they are so concerned with over staying customers, other karaoke establishments will flip your screens to a \"come again\" message and prevent customers from continuing to sing. It was a pretty fun night until they herded us out like they never wanted to see us again. For what it's worth, the bus boy tried to be very polite about the situation when we left.",

(Scroll down if you want review only on karaoke)  But  Private room and bathroom dirty.  Drinks: The mixed drinks were not good. The bartender said she can make me a basic lime margarita but then asked me what goes into it (its your job to know) so i just got their Hennessey tea instead but you can really taste the liquor. needed honey or sugar.  Service: They also tried to rush us out of our $40/hour private room (stopped in our room at the half hour, 15, 10 , and 5 minute markers before our time was over to remind us that we leave at 1). They never checked to see how things were going. And being in chinatown, their service wasnt great for our non-asian looking group.  Automatically charged 18% gratuity for them to pick up empty cups. They didn't bring us drinks or offered any assistance or to take any order if we wanted food.  Karaoke selection/system: cool with the touch screen but it froze on us and wasted 5-10 minutes of our room time, which we didnt get back and wasnt given something for (they also knew that song messes up the system: so why do you still have it?). song selection is not organized well and is missing karoke classics. Qlso no \"top choices\" or \"todays hits\" or even a genre selection. Decent artists but the songs for them were unpopular songs. Lots of duplicate songs. Lame music videos that looked like it was made in the early 90s if it wasnt the official video. ( we had a video play of a woman walking along the beach for Usher -\" yeah\"). both mics in the room ran out of battery quickly and had a lot of feedback.",

It was a good idea that we did because we got to sing all the songs we wanted without waiting and we also had a private bathroom!  The karaoke and sound system are more technologically advanced than some of the other karaoke bars I've seen.  Everything is touch screen.  The only downside was their selection of songs.  There were a lot of Chinese songs (which I understand since it is in Chinatown) but there wasn't much variety of English songs.  There wasn't much service though.  If you need a drink or something to eat, you will have to walk out to the bar to order one.  Oh, and biggest mistake is for them not to serve tap water!!!!  They force you to buy bottled water for a ridiculous price!  Seriously?  I don't think that's legal by the way.  But other than that fluke, everyone enjoyed themselves and it was overall a great time.",

When it came to requesting songs, the setup was easy enough to navigate. The problem came when I selected a few songs and waited for two hours for them to play. I stood there and watched as the attendant (who didn't look much older than 18) continually moved his own selections in front of mine. Friends of mine went up and addressed to issue, because I didn't want to start any problems, yet he kept moving me down the list. Eventually our group left due to the fact that he was being so rude and failing to take the customer into consideration.",
