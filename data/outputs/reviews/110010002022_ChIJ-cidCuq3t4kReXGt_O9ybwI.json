There was also a small space heater available in case it got chilly. It was very cute!!  Service: Spectacular!! Our waiter and the gentleman who prouder our our food were super friendly and knowledgeable. Our waiter in particular made sure we were comfortable and we\u2019re getting our meals fired as we were wrapping up our starters. We found out he also made our drinks were delicious and strong!  Food: Absolutely delicious! We had the steak tartare and grilled octopus to start. I\u2019ve never eaten steak tartare before so I can\u2019t compare it to anything but it was very good! The grilled octopus was my favorite. The char on the octopus was to die for. I would definitely order that again. Our entrees were the Parisian gnocchi and the roasted duck. The gnocchi melted in my mouth and was so fresh. I might even say that\u2019s the best gnocchi I\u2019ve ever had. My partner had the duck and absolutely loved it. I thought it was delicious as well!  Summary: It\u2019s a delicious restaurant with a great staff, definitely go try it out!!!",

Crispy on outside, chewy on Inside.  Charred cabbage salad was unique and delicious.  Husband\u2019s Salad was quality lettuce and very good.  Note: portions were Generous on all food.  Entrees were duck and roast chicken.  Both Delicious.  Roast chicken most moist and meaty ever.  Dessert was a Rhubarb whipped cream confection which was refreshing but could have Had more fruit.

My our steaks were cooked to order (one medium, one rare) obviously prime beef, very tender, excellent seasonings. Great cocktails, including a delicious non-alcoholic one, as was the waiter\u2019s recommendation on a glass of red to go with the wine. Being a slim fellow without a care as to calories, he tried to convince us to take the chocolate dessert, but we opted instead for the delicious rice pudding with a crunchy granola style top \u2014 we\u2019re going with the theory that it was another vegetable. My dessert S\u00e9millon wine was outstanding as well.  Big change is the individual outdoor \u201cchalets\u201d occupying what used to be parking on Wisconsin Avenue. Plenty of room for four, spacious for just the two of us, with translucent wall panes allowing filtered outside street lights and the headlights of passing cars.Very romantic, made even cozier by the electric heater in the corner. Staff were all appropriately masked, and we were happy to don our own each time food or drink was served. All perfect.  Many thanks to DC Council and the Mayor for permitting streeteries and for helping out financially. Let\u2019s hope streeteries continue year round.  Original from Feb 2020  What a pleasant surprise!  This is for us a neighborhood restaurant, just a block from our house. It was previously Cafe Bonaparte, which was not a cafe, but rather a cr\u00eaperie with a few extra dishes thrown in. The decor and vibe was quite Parisian, which we liked. It was also quite cheap, and attracted big crowds into its tiny space for dinner, which we did not like. I recall meals cheek by jowl, and once the host tried to seat our party of three at a table for two; we walked out, and haven\u2019t been back for dinner since, preferring instead the excellent Bistro Lepiq up Wisconsin or the equally outstanding Chez Billy Sud ( more nouveau French) and La Chaumi\u00e8re (more classic French) down in the more commercial heart of Georgetown.  Now Lutece: remodeled, and delightfully more open after they\u2019ve converted former crowded tables in the rear to stools from which patrons can peer into the kitchen. A great host/waiter offered perfect service, attentive but not intrusive. I do fear that on a crowded night the service, as in the Bonaparte days, might slow to a crawl, but I was pleased when the bartender pitched in to help \u2014 teamwork!  Outstanding cocktails \u2014 mine was Green Chartreuse bittered with Fernet Branca, sweetened just so with cura\u00e7ao, plus a gentle squeeze of lime. Check the online menus \u2014 we had carrots and dry-age duck, roasted chicken, a burger, and tile fish, all to perfection, a bit of something for every taste. And the desserts! We inquired about the chef, Matt Conroy, and he popped out to say hello.  Many thanks to the Popal Group for this outstanding renovation and reimagining. It works. We\u2019ll be back!",

Full disclosure... we were big fans of chef Matt Conroy when he was doing wonders at Oxomoco in Brooklyn, so we rushed to see what magic he would bring to this new spot. Everything was outstanding... tomato salad, corn soup, chicken, lamb ribs, charred cabbage, burger, grilled swordfish, atmosphere, service. They were very pandemic-friendly with sufficiently-spaced tables both indoors and outdoors. Can't wait to come back.",

Had come here many years ago when it was Cafe Bonaparte for breakfasts of great coffee and crepes. Since we have just moved back and heard they were doing dinner we wanted to try. It was excellent! My wife and I started with the steak tartare, and the kohlrabi and blood orange salad. Both were so unique and so flavorful. For entrees we had the gnocchi with mushroom, and the duck. Again the gnocchi was very unique and yet was \u2018comfort food\u2019 delicious and the duck was prepared and seasoned perfectly. We finished off with the almond cake whose passion fruit glac\u00e9 was just the right touch of citrus. Service from Simona was professional, and attentive but very friendly and welcoming. All and all our best dining experience since we returned to Washington DC five months ago, and that includes restaurants we loved, like Chez Billy Sud, 1789, Fiola Mare, etc.",
