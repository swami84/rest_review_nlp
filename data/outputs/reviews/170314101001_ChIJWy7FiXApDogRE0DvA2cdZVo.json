The Guy running the lottery machine didn't get the tickets correct and over charge. When I tried to explained he was doing it wrong, he became very unprofessional and rule.  Refused to correct the tickets after I showed him his mistake. Starting servicing on other customers as if I wasn't standing at the window. Another Employee tried to correct his mistakes but was unsuccessful. Customers should not have to be subject to unprofessional behavior and disrespect. It's getting very hard to find Good Customer Services nowadays....  Very Disappointed...",
