We immediately called the restaurant person informing about the food and the arrogant person replied to us that this is how we cook and that\u2019s how it is made. Not even a single word of apology. Now we are scared that hopefully none of us fall sick because of this food. I read Some reviews here that people fell sick after eating in this restaurant.

My personal favorites are spinach chat, chicken korma, madras chicken and paneer saag !",

I really don't know why they don\u2019t have more branches especially since they are so close to Georgetown. And they have an upstairs bar that's open til 1AM on a weekday!?! Hands down the best Indian food I've had being in DC for 5 years.",

People who come here and rate it low, I assume are expecting a Michelin star dining experience, this place is not that.

They answered all of our questions (i.e. What is this sauce? Can we make the dishes extra spicy? Etc.) They also gave us some food items and dessert on the house. And, our main server was hilarious.  Finally, the price: More than reasonable, in my opinion.  Will definitely come here again, and will order delivery, too! Also hope to check out the upstairs bar area one day.",

I felt disgusted more and stopped eating. I was scared cockroaches will get in to my purse so I kept moving my purse around far from the wall.

Service was prompt, ordered Mango lassis and masala tea for drinks. Tea was weak, lassi was a bit too sweet, but tasted fine. Veggie and meat  Thalis (platters with a variety of veggies, Naan and rice for the former; and chicken/lamb/beef and Daal for the latter) were our choice for entrees. Taste was overall good; meat platter needed another veggie though. Dessert was included in the platter price, and turned out to be Rice Kheer (pudding). Latter was a disappointment, as it consisted of condensed milk and rice with no nuts, raisins, saffron, cardamom or other typical condiments/flavorings. Was expecting to have Mango Kulfi, the other dessert advertised, but was informed it was not available! Overall, food (except dessert) was tasty enough but pricey...$120 for four persons!",

I ordered the Paneer Makhani, and honestly I didn't love it. It tasted much sweeter than I recall it tasting other times that I'd had it, it kind of tasted like it had cinnamon in it and personally I am not a fan of cinnamon in anything other than dessert. The manager and the staff pretty much insisted on making me something else, and kept saying how they just really wanted us to be happy with our experience there. Far surpassing expectations. All in all the food was amazing and the service, even better! They were so kind and attentive which was very refreshing. I would definitely go back.",

While the tandoori wasn't cooked well. We lost appetite after tasting these 2 dishes.  Talk about the restrooms.. it rubs salt to the wound. Very badly maintained. I wish Gordon Ramsey reviews this restaurant and I bet he would have ripped them apart. By any standards I would never say this is an Indian cuisine and kindly change the name of your restaurant.

We ordered lamb vidaloo and butter chicken along with naan and aloo naan, which I had never tried. The entrees were good, however the vindaloo was not as spicy as I've usually had it. The naan was excellent, and I especially recommend the aloo naan (naan with veggies).  The service was some of the best I've experienced in the city. They were attentive and friendly, and my water glass was always full. I will definitely come here again when I'm in the area.",

They were all frozen curry, heated and served upon orders! We also had a cardamom tea and I don't even have proper words to describe the taste of it!  This is not Indian food at all! Indian food is a cuisine rich in spices, flavors and textures. This is absolute nonsense. If you have tasted proper Indian food in your life, you'll agree with me! Please don't go here it's just waste of money.  And also the restroom was so stinky and very very dirty! They don't have a separate place to just wash hands so you have to go to the restroom. Cleanliness is zero! And inside the restaurant was dark with dim lights!  Horrible, horrible place!",

Chicken Dhania was supposed to be the spicest dish, and it was the coolest one, even after we asked for Higher spice level.Basket of Naan lacks in quantity and the naans were unevenly cooked, undercooked at some portions and burned at others. The waiter was RACIST, and spoke of how he hated walking near black people after we told him we go to HOWARD UNIVERSITY.  NO WAY DID HE DESERVE THE 18% GRATUITY.

I will admit that we have only done takeout, and that we are slightly biased by our extreme love for Karavalli in Latham, but Flavors of India offers solid Indian food.  My dining partner and I order from here fairly often. I always have ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken korma.  I know it's not the most exciting, but those are among our favorites.  I love that I am always asked about heat level.  Although tikka masala generally comes as a mild dish automatically at most places I have ordered it, I am always asked my preferred spice level here. I have asked for medium and spicy, and I now ask for somewhere on between medium and spicy!  I think the kick of heat adds a really nice flavor to the creaminess of the masala. My dining partner is spice-shy, so he gets his korma mild, but really enjoys the subtle flavors and non-heat spices it offers.  The portions are not huge, but usually plenty enough that I get a dinner out of it and a lunch the next day.  My only drawback for Flavors of India thus far is that I am not a big fan of their naan.  We always get the plain, and it has always come across to be a little dry and crumbly to me.  Perhaps it'll be better when we finally dine-in.  The prices are a hair high, but to me, the quality is worth it.  And speaking of dining in, the restaurant really is lovely.  I'll be coming back here for something other than take out -- and maybe something other than chicken tikka masala soon!",

Luckily, because the reservation was made well in advance, they let us in.  Still, I was walking on eggshells because I was hoping they don't rush us or make the food mediocre.  Although the person we had told us they needed our order quickly, we were pleased with the general treatment.  We were well attended to, our food was made quickly and the naan bread was seemingly fresh.  I actually liked the mattar paneer with the rice, the naan, and samosas.  Although, the meat samosa took my surprise at the high level of meatiness, it still tastes delicious with the chutney.  Plus, the manager was friendly with us. Truthfully, everything was better than I expected for the time that we showed up.  Thank you, Taste of India!",

We were seated quickly as the restaurant was only 30% full. The service was mediocre. They never came by to ask about how the meal was. When I asked them what was an entree was made with, the waiter gave me a snark response.  They spilled water all over the table a couple of times and pretty much ignored us for a good portion of the time. They also tried charging us 25% tip, perhaps thinking we were tourists (which we were but I been to DC before).  We ordered the Vegetable platter - a combo of vegetable samosa, veggie Pakora, chicken tikka and beef sheek kabab to share. I am not sure how chicken and beef is considered a vegetable platter but whatever. It came with one piece of each and it was pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken curry ($12) but the waiter said their more expensive Chicken Vindaloo ($13) was a better option. Thanks for the recommendation, but I didn't really like being asked multiple times if I was sure about my order. The chicken curry came with basmati rice and it was decent.  Lapin ordered the Meat Thali ($20) - an assortment of chicken makhani, lamb palak, beef curry, and lentils served with Basmati rice, naan, and riata. Lapin liked everything except the lamb palak because it had too much spinach. We also ordered a mango kulfi which was very small and hard to break apart. We warmed the spoons with the candle on the table to help break the dessert apart but it was still very hard to eat.  The food is decent but the service is lacking.",

I thought it was just me, but then I started seeing their staff walking around wearing sweaters, winter hats, and scarves.
