My girlfriend and I where a it hungry and he was just so helpful letting us know about the other few places that would be open and let us know what they served and gave great reviews about each and their specialties.  I have never in my years have experienced this and specially the way the world is so crazy.  Well we decided to wait it out came back to OAK's and not only was are server  quick but Ashley also had shown great customer service.  All around the Service, Food and Drinks where amazing and the restaurant is beautiful.  Thanks guys for making my first time in Gainesville awesome.",

The steak was cooked perfectly, but the hollandaise sauce was too runny and made the biscuit soggy. Breakfast potatoes were cooked well with a crispiness on the outside and soft potato on the inside. Drinks were good, if a bit diluted. Prices were fair considering the location. Service was excellent! Our waitress even split the dessert amongst the 2 people who got it without being asked. Nice rustic decor and ambiance.  Edit: I came back and was disappointed. The chicken and waffles that I had thought was such a great deal for the amount of chicken you got was just a one-off thing. This time, the chicken was about 1/3 of the size from last time. I don't like that inconsistency in serving sizes. Also, it took us much longer to get our food this time. On the bright side, I tried the Orange Blossom Mimosa and it was delicious!",

One of the people had a dog and WHILE WE WERE EATING the dog was jumping all over us and going under our stools. Staff said noting. Additionally for the two hours we were there we saw our waitress maybe four times. Getting drinks refilled and sauces ect was nearly impossible. Lastly the food. Delicious... mostly. WAYY over priced. My dad found multiple shrimp peels in his shrimp and grits, and the lettuce on my salad was burnt and wilted. (They grill the lettuce for extra flavor, but mine tasted like only ash)  The quality did not match the price, and additionally the price did not match the service. Overall not worth it.",

There\u2019s not a very big selection but the items they do carry are pretty good. However, the pours here are way below average, if I\u2019m paying 7.99 for a glass of a 10.99 bottle of wine, I expect to have a decent pour or at least a portion controlled amount. The pours are always freehanded and filled less than half way in a very tiny glass. I\u2019d be more than happy to order multiple glasses but it just doesn\u2019t make sense for what you get. I think a little portion control for the bartenders using mini decanters could go a long way. This is the only reason I brought my 4 star review down to a 3.",

My problem is when your paying to eat out at a sit down restaurant, you expect service. When you go somewhere like OAK you expect it to be quality service. 2 visits ago they messed up the type of salad my wife ordered. To fix it they pulled the chicken off the wrong one and tossed it into the new, only problem is it had cheese and dressing off the wrong salad and the dressing is the specific reason my wife didn\u2019t want it.  Because we had previously loved the restaurant we gave it another shot. This time we were sat at a table and then waited 15 minutes without a waiter to even greet us! Needless to say we left and are extremely disappointed",

The service was where there were issues. Part of HH on Fridays is free bacon, which was never mentioned by our server, but a friend asked for it and was assured it would come. It never came. Then during checkout there were issues with two of our friends' bills. Without going into details, cards were charged the wrong amount multiple times with minimal apology.

However, as of July 2018, they have a better menu with more wines and more creative food. The space has a cool downtown vibe with an open wall facing first street.  Honestly, the food was not incredible, it was good enough, but the service and ambience made up for it.  The service was solid and our sever did a fantastic job of juggling multiple tables despite a Saturday onslaught.  I had the lamb, which was good, despite being very rare (I ordered medium). The charcuterie platter was superb. The restaurant would be best for a informal cocktail and bar food meet-up. I will go back!",
