I ordered the stuffed shrimp with crabmeat with a side of Mac and cheese and candied yams. The order came with burnt- salty stuffed shrimp and mash potatoes (which I never asked for). The meal overall was ok but the Mac and cheese and shrimp were a little too salty (and I like salt so that should tell you something.)

It was love at first bite when I first had their Rasta Pasta.  However my recent trips to Bed-Stuy Fish Fry have been nothing short of disappointing. Although I called in both times, I still ended up waiting for over an hour and half both times. But nothing tops my visit today.  I called and placed my order of Rasta Pasta with grilled salmon as well as an order of fried whiting with cabbage and mash potatoes at 6:20pm. I get there and pay at 7pm thinking I should have to wait much longer for my food. Boy was I wrong. Although I checked in every 15 mins to make sure I didn\u2019t miss my number being called. It wasn\u2019t until 7:50pm when my number was finally called. I received my food and head to the car to take a few bites before heading back to Jersey and we were greeted with LUKE WARM food. How in the word could our food possibly be like warm after waiting so long?!?! This leaves me to believe that the food was most definitely ready before they finally let me know at 7:50pm although I literally checked in EVERY 15mins!!  Needless to say, this will be my last time giving them my hard earned money. Not to mention, the customer service is nothing to brag about either.  PS. The salmon was dry and the fish had more breading than actual fish.",

They finally go the order together and I asked once I saw a new Mac come out to at least give me a hotter one since my food has been sitting around for almost 30 minutes. The server, cashier and the 2 other women assembling my food all whispered words that I shouldn\u2019t get the swap even though I was waiting for an hour.

So I stopped here Friday afternoon for the 1st time since they re-opened, and ordered the Chicken Caesar salad on the menu, with Catfish. The moment the girl who took my order sent it through to the kitchen the chef began to complain. I asked her if there was a problem since the salad and Catfish were on the menu, she confirmed they would fulfill my order. But the entire time the chef was arguing and complaining to staff about my order, and I was so perplexed. It was loud enough for other patrons to hear. I was so uncomfortable I ended up changing my order to fish they had in their buffet instead. While another staff member packed up my food, I could still hear the chef making complaints about my order of Catfish. Terrible approach to service. Safe to say I won\u2019t be returning back here.",

There's one of two issues that I had with this establishment, and not one of my reasons will make me not go back, so please enjoy and patron this restaurant.

Everything was so greasy    Nothing was fresh; I do believe my fish was prepared earlier and it was placed in hot grease for rewarming and then given to me I had to drink 2 cups of tea just to settle my stomach behind the greasiness of course there was no way I could finish eating even half of the food I purchased!",

It took me a while to decide what to order since everything looked good. I settled on the salmon, mashed potatoes and the collard greens. Man! It was so tasty. The mashed potatoes were creamy rich and were real potatoes.. the salmon had this sauce, a little sweet..a little spicy.. and perfect for my mouth. The collards were made just right. The prices were very reasonable for the plate of food you receive. The staff was welcoming and greeted me as I walked in the door. The manager was there, hands on and very attentive to the our needs. I will definitely be back to try the other yummy items on the menu.",

I\u2019m not sure what changed with the cooks at this location, however, the food was HORRIBLE! I ordered the grilled shrimp over fettuccine. The garlic sauce it\u2019s cooked in had way too much garlic and was too oily. Also, some of the pieces of shrimp were undercooked.  Bed stuy fish fry, please review the quality of food you are serving your local customers.",

Salmon was thickly coated, almost burnt crisp and served as one big slab.. fries were cold.. & the sandwich came with tiny, sliced wheat bread that couldn't even hold the fish well. Served with blah tarter sauce & hot sauce. Just not impressive at all. Aaand they didn't even have all the desserts listed on their menu.
