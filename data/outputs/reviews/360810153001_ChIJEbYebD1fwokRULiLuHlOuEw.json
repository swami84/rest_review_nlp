Everyone is actually wearing there mask, over there noses, Which I love! Big shout out, to there beautiful, friendly Employees! Omg, and of course the chef, is amazing! Order the Skirt Steak!!!!!! That steak keeps me coming back for more! There's outside and indoor dining. The outside is actually heated, so you can book a table all year round. I love the outside! They did such a good job, setting up the outdoor, it's so spacious, cute, comfy and fun! Thers a DJ, playing all the best hits, keeping you dancing,from the minute you walk in, and you can't help dancing in ur seat, the whole time. The Restrooms are spotless, and it's actually so pretty down stairs, that you have to pull out ur phone and take pics. Lol For my daughters birthday, the employees came out with a cake, big super mansion birthday sign, and those big firery candles, singing and dancing happy birthday to her. I was not expecting that, and it was so cute and fun! So THANK YOU! To everyone at the Super Mansion, for all the love and care you show ur customers, and making my baby's 13 teenth birthday, one she will always remember. \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude1a",

My party arrived before me and they would  let them in and wait even thou we made reservations. i requeated a table by the straw wall when i made the reservation  but they still didnt give me one  even thou there was a empty one. the  atmosphere is great But i will not return. The drinks are great however the service and food is terriable Lobster roll and all the other food were super tiny and flavor less but overpriced.  there hookah was terrible.We had bought  in a cake. Our bill was over 800$ but they tried to charge us 50$ for paper plates  provide to serve our cake. Ive never heard of that in my life. Also wish they would let you mix  the bottle service package,  where u should be able to get a champagne and liquore but its either or. Over the only  think nice about this place is decor. I had high expectations",
