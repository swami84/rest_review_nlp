The \"chicken\" was a greyish color and off tasting. I think the guacamole is the same packaged kind found at the grocery store. Everything tasted as if it came from a can.

Again, I am not Mexican, so I cannot speak to the authenticity of the food, but I can say it was terrible--even worse than I remembered.

We changed out the blue cheese for queso fresco cheese and it was so good, the chicken was crunchy and had a delicious flavor. The Mexican rice was also fantastic, they give you a good amount in a bowl. The only negative is that the tacos are a little pricey for just one but it is definitely worth it and the service was wonderful! It is a great local spot with delicious food. I can't wait to go back.",
