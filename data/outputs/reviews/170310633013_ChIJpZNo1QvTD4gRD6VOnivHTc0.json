The reason is I'm working on a children's book called Abe Lincoln: Land Surveyor from Illinois, and I'd love to hear his constructive criticism, and likely incorporate all of the feedback.  For Abe and Abe, despite the pronunciation variance, have the same high classic style of multilateral diplomacy: they know their foreign relations, or knew.  Shinzo, I haven't eaten here yet, but it's a real invitation, and then I could dedicate the book to him, although there's a lot of people that would share the list with him.  Lung Chu-Chen already did the leg work to get into my dedication page, but Shinzo Abe; well, I can't dedicate it to him with integrity.  I do like him though, and let's face it: not all Heads of State know their diplomacy, but Japan's does these days, right up there along with the German Chancellor.  I haven't eaten here yet, but I already know it's going to be good.  There's two vegan options here, although the first is labeled vegan.  I walked in there after having passed by with interest many times, and I remember: it really was for investigatory purposes: I'd probably be picking up some food there and not only was there one meal option: Tanaka Ramen in Lakeview has two.  The best part of course was that I think the girl I talked to was Japanese, and having been outside all day  rolling in the mud with my Shiba Inu, I wasn't expecting to pass by that ideal type of Japanese new friend, that you know everyone at work or school is competing to be friends with, we circled and passed, communicated under pandemic masks, which in my day of research at a few places, does add another barrier, but this Japanese beauty and I seemed to figure it all out in English in a few moments. There's two vegan options at Tanaka Ramen, for meals, clearly labeled, and a lot better than most places or nearly everywhere.  The second vegan option is label vegetarian which is actually true and accurate, for it's vegetarian and vegan.  And I think we were looking briefly at the ingredients, and confirmed: \"There's two vegan options at this place: Tanaka Ramen.\"  All I can say is that one person left Tanaka Ramen thinking, \"This place is the Athenian Candle Shop of Lakeview's restaurants: 100 Years more, I hope, and always called Tanaka Ramen for continuity.  I remember  clutching my Shiba Inu: a difficult breed in some ways, but also the best, and the right dog I knew I had to have a few years ago.  Who is the new \"It\" girl at the University of Chicago?  I was wondering what her subjects are, but it's better not to ask and just hope they are Linguistics, Romance Languages & Law.  I mean, she also may not necessarily have been a University of Chicago student, but she just seemed to do everything right.  Well, the person who stumbled in there today, the guy who desperately hopes to meet Shinzo Abe one day., where I'd probably just say nothing, but who knows: if he asked me questions about what I loved in Hiroshima, and the Japanese man who took me to the baseball stadium briefly and train station.  Literally, a person who saved my day, for I only had a day there, and the Japanese being the smartest, I  can't even remember how he helped me find the place, or who he was.  I must have asked someone for directions or looked lost. The person I'd really want to tell Shinzo Abe about is the Japanese girl on the blue trolly car.  For this many years after the trip, I'm wondering, \"Did I add her on after?\"  I'm pretty sure I didn't, and there was one girl in particular, who seemed to be checking me out, just as I was her. I'd tell Shinzo, \"I think she understood the Nirvana shirt I wore, not only a Kurt Cobain tribute.\"  And the colorful cranes, of origami from the book about the girl with a name like Sadaku. I usually cite my trip to London, England, as my first encounter with the foreign, but I had Japanese exchange students",

The bad: We had ordered 3 Ramens and 2 appetizers (Tofu and Rock Shrimp).  When we were first given our order, it seemed like we were missing items.  Then, as we were leaving, the worker gave us the Tofu app.  Even so, seemed like there was food missing but I figured how can the mess this up, especially after initially forgetting the Tofu.  Well we get to the room and the Rock Shrimp was missing.  I was so upset but whatever, mistakes happen.  That is not the worst part.  When I call, the guy offers for me to walk back and pick it up.  No apology at all.  That is what got me steamed.  How hard is it to say \" sorry for the mistake\".  Nothing.  Nada.  Well, I told him I didn't want to walk back so please give me a refund for the app.  He said he would try and abruptly hung up.  Again, no \" my bad\" or anything.  How rude.  You would think that business being slow, they would appreciate the business.  I will never return to that restaurant.  Now am awaiting the refund.  Time will tell.  I recommend that if you do decide to visit, make sure to check your order.  If you want good customer service, go elsewhere.",

I lived there for two years and now I'm having a hard time finding a decent ramen that is just as good but this places comes so close! The broth has so much flavor! And the ramen noodles are so authentic is was such a great bowl of ramen. I also ordered gyozas and they were delicious and just as good as Japan as well. I also got a delicious pork bun and an order of the fried chicken appetizer. The fried chicken was seasoned with too much pepper and when I bit into it l, it was kind of touch to bite into because the way the chicken was cut.  The server was nice however she only refilled my water once and a second time when I asked. I am always drinking water so I was out pretty quickly. There was also a couple that kept staring at me and making me feel super uncomfortable. I was eating alone though so I'm guessing they thought it was a strange thing. Never the less the atmosphere was great and they were not busy at all. It was Saturday around 3pm when I came in.",

Apparently the noodles they serve and deliver as part of their daily business are much better/bigger, but these were the thinnest, mushiest noodles I have ever eaten in anything let alone ramen.  I appreciate a lot of the efforts being made to make ramen in this form deliverable during the lunch hour to large business locations, but at over $8 for a pile of mushy noodles and two pieces of pork I was a dissapointed. Again, the broth was fantastic and I am sure they do a much better job in their actual restaurant, but if you cant fix the noodles, you shouldn't call what you serve through Fooda ramen.",
