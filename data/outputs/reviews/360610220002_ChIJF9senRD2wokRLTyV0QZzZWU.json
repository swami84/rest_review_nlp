Their updated menu didn't have much to offer unlike their online and outside menu. Also the prices on our ticket did not match the prices on the menu. Everything was $1 or $2 more without any notice and they automatically included an 18% tip into the receipt for a party of 2. Overall not impressed. Maybe the good reviews were for the alcoholic drinks",

Its completely covered so the outside elements do not affect you in ANY way, you can dine in any weather, even the snow because the dining area has floors as well. It's the most covid friendly setting because you don't share the same air with any of the other guests and that's what made me eat there. It's like a small house with rooms. The service is fast but the wait can be up to an hour. The food is very good and the drinks are as well. I would recommend this place for any occasion and its kid friendly",

The margherita was on point! Service was friendly and welcoming and accommodating. Guacamole was almost as good as mine but still very good. I would definitely return for an affordable Mexican meal.

The quaint small restaurant was decked out in Halloween/Day of the Day decorations. We noted for two the surly host pointed us to the wobbly table in the corner next to the fireplace.  We started with the guacamole/salsa with chips. I had the mixed fajita and my friend got the chicken burrito. We can't say much about the guacamole as it was fine. One can't really mess that up.  The burrito came as just that. No sides are anything. It wasn't the best he's ever eaten but we were hungry. The fajita was in  a pool of oil. There was plenty for two even though our surly host said it was for one because we initially wanted to share it. The chicken was fine was well as the shrimp but the steak was dry and cooked to death like the La Catrina hanging on the wall.  Food was alright. Service was alright. El Encanto didn't quite charm me.",
