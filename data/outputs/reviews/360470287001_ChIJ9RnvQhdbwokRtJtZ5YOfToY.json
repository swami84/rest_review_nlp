        "caption": "I\u2019ve ordered asai bowls online twice already. Ingredients are fresh, quantity I believe is a little more than 16oz, which other bowl shops mostly serve as far as I checked. I was very satisfied with the way they packed it. I asked them to pack granola separately from the other ingredients to keep it crispy, it was done neatly as I asked. One thing I came up with the online order was though, it will be even greater if you had \u201cadd extra topping\u201d option with the charge. Easier to spend more money that way. It says it\u2019s Black owned. I\u2019m rooting for you, please survive covid.",

The coco-green and coco-blue acai bowls are what really keep me coming back.  The space they have is nice. Modern, clean, and comfortable. Hopefully they actually get to use it.  It's a little pricey, and orders take really long. I'm not sure how they'd deal with say, 5 customers at the same time. Not sure if there's order for pickup without paying major fees to online platforms.  It's worth trying and it's the only place of its kind around.",
