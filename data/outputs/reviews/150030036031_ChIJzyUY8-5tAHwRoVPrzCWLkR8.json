I was thankful for this, and said that I would eat well.'Here, green onions are expensive, but we give it nicely~'. Then, he said, \"Pa Muchim $7.5\" is stamped on the bills.... I ate it for $8 to get the green onion tax, but of course I can eat it if I want to eat it, but it's different from getting my money and telling me what I ordered and pretending to give it as a service and then eating 8 dollars. Haha, the female boss or employee? It was embarrassing to think that I went over the above.  He also gave me a tip of 20% in advance, but the tip was at the service level I wanted to give a minimum of 10%, but after putting it at 20%, we checked the bill, so'I added a tip~' in short.  It's unpleasant because it's a tip and the business mind is overwhelming. 0% willingness to return.  I think you shouldn't go to a place like this.

I went to a restaurant to have a sweet spot today, and the waitress in the front desk guided me and my husband to my chin. \"Sit over there,\" pointing to the table with your chin. It was unpleasant because I was so uncourteous, but I was hungry, so I ordered a fire hot pot, a cup of warm water, and a glass of iced water. He gave me a scoop to scoop up the fire nabe hotpot and asked for it to change because the scoop has food residue on it. I took it without saying a word of sorry. After that, I brought water and asked for a change because the lipstick was clearly on the glass, and I took it without saying anything sorry. The food comes out and I'm eating it. My husband and I don't use the plate that we haven't used yet. Even if you're invited to a friend's house and eat your home, you still have the basic courtesy. Can I have this treat while eating about $ 60 for two people at a restaurant? What do you do if the food is delicious. Mrs. Waitress don't have basic courtesy. And it's too embarrassing to have a lot of foreigners come and go. Compared to the other Korean restaurants, Sorabol has one of the best tasting, authentic Korean food choices. However, my experience today ruined the way I think of the restaurant as a whole. The waitress by the front desk / hostess area, welcomed me and my husband by pointing to the table with her chin. Yes. WITH HER CHIN. She used her chin to point to the table, saying \u201cGo over there to that table.\u201d We sat down, ordered our food, and received a soup ladle, 1 iced water, 1 hot tea and 3 empty plates. I picked up the soup ladle and noticed dried up food on it. I asked the waitress for another one, and she just took the ladle away, without saying anything. Then, as I picked up the cup to drink my hot tea, I noticed a hot pink, glittery lip marking from someone else \u2019s lipstick on the cup. DISGUSTING. I once again asked the waitress to exchange my hot tea. She ONCE AGAIN just took the cup, without saying anything. I was appalled, but our food came out, so we began to eat. As we were enjoying our food, the waitress came to our table and said, \u201cI \u2019m going to take the empty plates if you \u2019re not going to use it,\u201d and took the plates without giving us the time to answer her. Here are my thoughts, plain and simple. It does n\u2019t matter how good the food is if the waitresses ca n\u2019t treat their customers with manners. I will not be coming back to Sorabol again.

Unfortunate for me that I waited so long as they got really good food there that I have been missing out on.  Probably a big reason for not going sooner is the parking situation in the area.  Their parking lot can be challenging most of the time and the surrounding areas have very limited street parking.  Your best bet to secure parking and not deal with a headache of hunting for a spot is to just park across the street the Walmart.  Usually the second floor is wide open and you can so some shopping afterwards if you should so choose.  We ordered a bubbling joy of Crab Stew (Spicy) and Intestine Tripe Stew (mild) which both were excellent.  They arrived hot and fresh.  Flavors were just amazing and portion sizes large.  My only complaint on the Crab Stew, but they provided no tools for cracking the crab parts or extra napkins as you have to dig in and get down and dirty with this stew, but it was worth it as there was lots of crab.  Another great part about the meal was the excellent banchan.  I think this is a real deciding factor for me when it comes to Korean restaurants on how much effort they put into their banchan.  The staff are all very friendly and attentive.  It was comfortable and clean. Definitely will go back and do recommend it to others.",

I traveled to Hawaii for a long time to have a good Korean food and I ate bad food, but the calculation method is not so cute. The Tip is a measure of the customer's service and a percentage. When you travel to the United States, you do not know how to calculate a tip. Tip is strictly customer-defined. By the way, this restaurant has been carrying 20% \u200b\u200bof tips at its discretion. We do not count this way in any American restaurant. Perhaps it would not have been if there were Americans or people familiar with tip culture.  I think the Koreans who traveled are the biggest customers, but it is really unpleasant. When I meet in a foreign country, it is a sad reality that Chinese people try to help each other and Koreans try to cheat each other.

The decor has beautiful paintings of old Korean story's, paper doors, they have a turtle and an arowana. It's more for an older crowd and for me it felt like if you're not Korean or look Asian (I'm Asian but look more White) they have to watch over you from ALL corners of the restaurant!

You can also have the grill your own meat style (yakiniku) as well... make sure you're not off to a formal engagement afterwards are you will smell of smoke. The side dishes also known as baan chan is plentiful and they refill it as soon as it's emptied. It's always healthy so eat as much as you are able. Sometimes I just order rice to eat along with the side dishes. Food is always tasty. Cost is on the higher average, but now days you always will have a take home box because you can never finish the portion. For a Korean fix this is our place to go.",
