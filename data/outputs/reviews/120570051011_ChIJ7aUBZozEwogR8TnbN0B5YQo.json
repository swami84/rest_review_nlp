One downfall is that when they are packed it can take up to 1 hour for you to get your food (happened to me twice) which is why you should always order ahead or visit during their slower hours!

In addition, most sushi rolls I've had come with a seaweed wrap,  but their burritos come with a yellow wrap that I assume to be rice paper (I could be wrong) and it was just gross tasting. I ended up eating my burrito messy and deconstructed. The fish inside the burrito seemed pretty fresh (though I'm no sushi expert) which is why I gave them three stars. I would consider coming back for poke or sashimi but I definitely won't get another sushi burrito there.",

        "caption": "Ordered on Uber. Downtown Roll has progressively gotten worse. I\u2019ve been a regular, but the last few times sushi has definitely gone down hill. If you even want to call it sushi. The salmon doesn\u2019t look like salmon; it\u2019s shredded white/light pink pasty substance. Almost like they are using imitation salmon and trying to pass it off as the real thing. I\u2019ve kept this place in mind for a while and been a regular due to the low price, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder what I\u2019m actually eating and why it\u2019s being advertised as something else. Over the time period I have been ordering, I have also watched the Downtown Roll shrink significantly in size. It would appear that there is some cost cutting going on and it\u2019s very apparent in the quality of the food. I noticed that the roll has become mostly rice, with a really tiny avocado and whatever you want to call this salmon stuff that doesn't even have the flavor of salmon. I really hope REAL quality sushi gets used in the future in a place that advertises having real sushi. In the event that the owner would like to respond to the declining quality over the last 3 months and commit to improvements, I'd give it one last try. But until then, I'm skeptical and will order sushi elsewhere.",

I've returned three times and ordered across each area of the menu in search of a redeeming gem for this weekly lunch staple. Each time (Orange/Teriyaki Chicken, Pho and Sushi), my order left much to be desired. Today's order included pieces of billow pad in the chicken and rice, which prompted not only removing this location from the rotation, but including a review of my recent experiences.",

Watch out for the lunch rush because it can get really backed out. They pump out the orders and you'll never have a huge wait (I don't even think I've seen someone get the wrong order before) but it gets crazy around the normal DT lunch hour.",

I love that you can customize your rolls from top to bottom, there are so many different choices of veggies and sushi meats, and their selection of dipping sauces never fails to impress me. Their bibimbap is PHENOMENAL if you're not into sushi - it's a rice bowl with thinly sliced Korean bbq beef, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and other vegetables. I highly, highly recommend a custom roll with the traditional wrap, avocado and cucumber, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna, sesame seeds, and wasabi mayo; with an eggroll on the side.  Another reason why I love this place is because it's a Mom-n-Pop shop, and everybody remembers your order and name if you come often. I think the customer service is great, they always thank you for coming and I normally don't wait any longer than 5 minutes for my food. Prices are definitely reasonable.  It makes me really annoyed to see reviews from customers who don't know what they're talking about - if you don't like their food, you probably have poor taste in foods in general. If you complain about the time it takes, you probably shouldn't go during the lunch rush, just like anywhere else in Downtown during that hour.",

It's a Korean dish that's kind of like mix-it-up-yourself fried rice loaded with veggies and a seasoned meat, you can skip the meat and go just with the veggies too. I recommend ordering an egg on top and using the chili sauce. When you get the dish everything will be separated into little piles on top of the rice with the fried egg on top, simply take the chili sauce an pour it on top then mix and mash everything together! Once it's all mixed real good, enjoy!  I usually fill up after eating half then take the rest home for dinner or a snack, not a bad deal for $9 and it's good Korean food. My husband, who is Korean, found this and told me about it. I'll add a pic of everything mixed up, there's the egg, seasoned meat (kind of sweet), spinach, cucumber, zucchini, bean sprouts and carrot.",
