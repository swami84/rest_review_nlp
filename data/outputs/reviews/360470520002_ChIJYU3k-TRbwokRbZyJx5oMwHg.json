The owners Sally and Arbor and staff are friendly and welcoming.. drinks are good, nice happy hour and there is nice backyard seating as well! Been going for a couple of weeks now and there is always a great mixed crowd and great atmosphere... def beats the other neighborhood atmospheres like oxcart, westwood and rusty nail. No one at wattli is stuck up!This is my new go to bar! Dress up or come casual either way you will feel comfortable. I was a bit skeptical about the location but I have noticed from the times I stopped in that some of the tenured neighborhood guys are usually there and they add a sense of security and they bring some life to the air as well! Overall like i said this is my stop from now on!",

First, I love the decor and really love that they have a little outdoor seating space (to the side of restaurant--you don't see it from the street). It definitely feels like a fun place to grab a drink and hang out. We'd already eaten but did try their appetizer plate and the food was good. Our cocktails were tasty. I'm exciting to see how they evolve as a restaurant and I would definitely recommend it stopping by.  My one complaint (and this is a complaint I frequently have) is that their cocktail menu is too small. They have a fully stocked bar, so I'm sure they could make whatever I'd want, and the cocktails they did have listed included some fun house made ingredients. Still, it can be too easy to default to your basic cocktails (not that there is anything wrong with a good Manhattan, but I can make that at home) if you don't see something that speaks to you on the menu. I really appreciate it when bars go through the effort of laying out more options through a lengthier cocktail menu. Given how new the restaurant is, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd already added things since I last went though. Regardless, I look forward to grabbing a drink and sitting outside on a nice day.",
