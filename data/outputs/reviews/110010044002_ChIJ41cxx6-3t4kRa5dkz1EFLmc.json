They also have food displays in addition to their menus up there by the register, so you can see what the food will look like!  The middle level dining area is well lit, with two large tables and two smaller tables. The lower dining area has more of a bar vibe. Dimly lit, with a projector playing Vietnamese music videos on the wall.  We ordered the com tam and bun cha, as well as the egg milk coffee and egg milk cacao. Both the food and beverages were fantastic! Serving sizes were great as well. I would highly recommend this place, and I\u2019ll be there for their grand opening for sure.",
