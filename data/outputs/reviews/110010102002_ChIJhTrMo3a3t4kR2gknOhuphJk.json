They mention nothing about it being served on a bed of shredded lettuce, so the bun is filled nearly to the top with lettuce, then just a few pieces of lobster on top hiding all the lettuce. I hate the taste of shredded lettuce, but it's also just a huge disappointment and rip-off. Wasn't served with pickle or lemon wedge either, and their hours are incorrect. They are not open 1130-9 on Friday. I stopped by at 2 trying to get lunch and they were closed. Tried again 7 and open with no wait... should have taken it as a sign.",
