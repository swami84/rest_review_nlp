The staff were unorganized, running into one another, and had seemingly no designated task. Once we got our order, the juices were not juice. They were ice smoothies. I don\u2019t believe they even owned a juicer. My wife got the Energy Plus and I the Revive. The Revive tasted like ice with blended spinach, same with the carrot and ice smoothie. The only saving grace is that they do have good bagels. As of right now We would only grab bagels to go.",
