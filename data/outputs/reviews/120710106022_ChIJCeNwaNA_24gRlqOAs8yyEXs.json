Upon arriving, I immediately had a bad feeling about this place.  We had to seat ourselves on the veranda and waited over fifteen minutes for a server to show up.  The waitress that did show up was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal however her sweet personality could not make up for the poor quality of the food.  We ordered two appetizers consisting of the Konch Fritters and the Boom Boom Shrimp.   The fritters had been over fried and were almost burnt.  The shrimp didn't appear to be fully cooked and the garnish it was served with was wilted and most likely several days old.  We followed up with the Fried Grouper Sandwich and a Cuban, both served with coleslaw.  The Grouper sandwich was tasty but the Cuban was fatty and had too much mustard on it that you couldn't taste the meat.  The ciabatta role was very dry and most likely stale.  The worst part of our meal was the coleslaw, which lacked any kind of dressing.  It was simply shredded cabbage with some carrot, which most likely came out of a bag.  We had soft drinks with our meal and passed on the  desserts not wanting to be further disappointed.  Our bill with tip came to nearly $70.  There are many other restaurants in the immediate area where you can get a very fresh and tasty meal for that kind of money.  I suppose many of the patrons of this place primarily go there for the alcohol and entertainment.  I cannot in good conscience recommend Duval Street for it's food.  I will not be returning.",

        "caption": "First visit was on a Friday night. We were disappointed. The mixed drinks were over $10 each, and just weren't worth it. We had a shrimp appetizer, and the flavors were great, but the shrimp were so overcooked. We assumed they were freezer burned, but they said that they don't use frozen shrimp. The inside dining room is lacking flair or almost any atmosphere. The lights are bright like at Denny's or perkins. If I went back I would only sit outside. The problem on this particular night was that the one man band was so loud outside that you can't even hear what the hostess is saying to you. Inside, there is a nice wine storage area, but on this particular night it was a mess and completely covered with empty cardboard boxes. Strange. While we were seated our table broke loose from the wall and fell on our laps. I was able to save our drinks from spilling but it took 2 staff to come over and move the table. We were trapped in our booth like rats in a trap. I saw there were 3 small screws holding the table into the drywall. The table only had one actually leg to rest on. Not a good design.  The young man who waited on us was great.",

My partner chose the Thurs. night $29 snowcrab leg special with a baked potato. Both came with asparagus, spaghetti squash, and carrots. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the side veggies were outstanding. The snowcrab legs were cooked  just right and tasty. Our free key lime pie dessert hit the spot. Manager/owner?, chef, hostess, and waiter Adam made us feel welcome and honored. 2 person man and woman band were outstanding and played an amazing variety well. Lots of regulars there who know a good thing. We'll definitely be back. Try them soon!",

I did try the shrimp n grits with out grits, not a fan. Only 3 shrimp for 9.00 and they were quite small. So if you are sharing who gets the extra shrimp? and there didnt seem to have a option of no side and a extra shrimp? The sauce that came with it was awesome. We then ordered burgers 1/4 , pound Im guessing. Didnt look overly impressive.  However it was cooked perfectly  mine mid rare, the other med. Very flavorful I had the bacon burger. The bacon was amazing. This is where it gets dicey. A few unexpected friends dropped by and we were apparently in the way ,because the servers kept edging us out of the way and having us move.  I understand  this ,however there was a huge pathway one table away. So why would you make your guests move when you could simply walk around them. Their expectation was We were supposed to move I don't get it I felt like it was rude and it was mentioned to the owner and the servers. But I guess we were the rude ones to expect the staff to take three steps to the right and move around us where there was no obstacle. In conclusion it was a pleasant experience except for the staff. The bartenders however we're very nice.",

        "caption": "I do understand that this establishment opened under new owners in the last three months, but this does not explain why we were treated by some in our visit to eat. A group of friends stopped at the outside bar there a week or so ago around lunchtime, the bartender (Jeff I think was his name..) was a very friendly, engaging person so we choose to stop in later that week for dinner. This is where it went straight downhill, 6 of us waited for an outdoor table with plenty of them vacant as we walked in. The hostess was working very hard, running all over the place after we let her know how many in our group... she seemed the only one who was concerned about work, the remainder of the staff not so much. A person who I believe was the owner came out, sat at the reservation podium and after an uncomfortable amount of time, looked up at us and asked if we were being taken care of, he immediately looked down, flipped through the reservation book and said the hostess will take care of us. After an uncomfortable amount of tine (NOT the hostess's fault!) we were seated. Our server came over with drink and food menu's and took our drink order, it took at least 10 minutes to receive our drinks , so we did not let her get away and placed our food order. The second round of drinks again took a long, long time with no real excuse whey... the establishment was slowing down due to the later hour we were there, folks ate and left. Our server was not at fault, clearly the owner needs to be much more involved and caring about his business if in fact he was the owner (as he told a member of our group he was), we as a group discussed how very long it took to be seated and very long to receive our first and second drinks, the bartender is clearly not good at that job being it was relatively slow during our visit (Jeff the bartender was not working that evening!) One of our food orders was under cooked, and a wine was served that had soured.. again our server was very caring and attentive, not so much the other staff. We love the way the establishment looked outside and in, but unless the owner and bartender(s) and the cook steps up their game, you may not want to stop in for a meal, if the owner does not care, why should some of the staff?",

You will recognize the unprofessionalism of the staff and disorganization of the business, talk about it, ask for refills, defend yourself, feel bad for asking for something again, talk about how the food is mediocre (the burger was good) and then leave feeling unwelcome and defeated. Maybe sit at the bar for a good experience?? (Me thinking of something positive to end on)",

We were there an hour and 12 minutes and our dinner showed up, but not our appetizer. We had to ask twice for refills on the drinks. The excuse was \"I have to wait on the bar.\" There was nobody at the bar. We were not the only table to complain either. There were two other tables we saw that complained. There was also one table that got up and left. The waitresses and the bus girl were also extremely rude when walking through tables and making the customers move in their chairs so they could get by, instead of walking around and not interrupting the customers. We were also double charged for something on the bill, which was eventually fixed after a lengthy period. Our waitress never even asked us how our meal was during or after. There were 11 waitresses I counted, and only ten tables occupied in the dining room. It should not have take over an hour to cook a chicken breast, two burgers, and a crab cake appetizer. On top of that the two hostesses were very sloppily dressed. One was wearing a hoodie, and one was in a jacket that did not even let anyone know they were members of the staff. The whole staff was totally unprofessional, and unorganized. We will not be returning to this restaurant ever again. Do not let the pictures fool you that have been posted. They don't have any of that on the menu!!!",

        "caption": "My wife is pregnant and was looking for some great food in the Cape. She didn't want good food rather great food. After looking at half a dozen menus online Duval's was the clear winner.  We had friends over and she was not feeling like going out but was desperate for what we saw so a buddy of mine and I headed down to grab it as take out and left the ladies at home.  Duvals is new and was not set up for take out in their first week but the staff went out of their way to find a way to pack up 4 meals so that we could take them home.  The food: The homemade bread and sweet almond butter is reason enough to go alone. Thats right almond butter. I'm not an alternative butter kind of guy but this stuff is like magic frosting on pillow soft bread we watched come right out of the oven.  The homemade coconut shrimp, stuffed mushrooms and conch fritters were all worthy of their own Jimmy Buffett chorus. When it came time for the Entre we did the thing you aren't supposed to do at a place with great seafood and ordered the prime rib. I do not regret this choice one bit. The PR was amazing! Cooked perfectly with great spice, flavor and an au jus that with change you. Cap off the night with their version of key lime pie which is more like a key lime tart in its graham cracker to filling recipe but outside monroe county FL its one of the best I've had.  I mentioned the staff: In many restaurants getting your order right, quick and with a smile gets 5 star service. At Duval's there was personality, fun, and a genuine feeling that they cared about the food they were serving and the people they were serving it to.  With the right ingredients you can have 5 star food, but it takes the right staff to have a 5 star restaurant.  Congratulations on being our new favorite spot in the Cape",

We had conch fritters for our appetizer and then I enjoyed the red snapper with crab meat topping. My husband had shrimp and grits. Accompanying each entree were a salad and vegetable and starch. I had double vegetables (a heavenly squash medley).  Well, folks, our food was divine. We have eaten in some very excellent restaurants like Roy\u2019s and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse and Duval\u2019s is right up there with the best. Our server, Daniela, was absolutely spectacular. What a sweetheart! She was kind but not intrusive. We really liked her.  I realize that I am using a lot of exaggerated language for Duval\u2019s, but this restaurant deserves every single word.",

I had shrimp and grits...and this is the reason for four stars. The shrimp were fantastic, but the grits were bland and doughy...definitely could stand improvement!! Their fresh bread with almond butter is awesome. Excellent service. A great addition to the Cape restaurant scene!! Highly recommend!!",

The interior is refreshingly pleasant and the staff is very accommodating.  We dined there looking for a variety.  Our main courses were baby back ribs and snapper.

Prices were very much inline with the quality of the food.  We look forward to returning to this establishment.",
