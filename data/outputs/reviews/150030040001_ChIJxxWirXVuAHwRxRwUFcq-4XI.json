This simple and cheap grab and go gut buster Piroscki shop was fairly decent.  I have to say, for a little restaurant in the downtown area, the service was very friendly and quick.  I was immediately asked what I wanted with a smile and graciously thanked. Even asked if I needed help by someone working hard in the kitchen that didn't noticed the other lady had already attended to me.  The pirosckis were hot and fresh, but deep fried, so they are why I call them gut busters.  Probably just what you need after a heavy night of drinking in the morning.  Ordered the beef, cabbage and cheese which was a mildly seasoned filling that went well with the deep fried pasty covering.  One thing for sure, the price was right.  It came to exactly $2 with tax, so it made for a cheap snack that didn't break the wallet and was probably a much better choice then ordering from the McDonald's dollar menu.  They also had a very reasonable lunch combination plate with fried calamari and salad for only $5.50.  So hard to get a cheap deal these days and this place has got them.  If a piroscki is not what you are in a mood for, the other side of the restaurant is Vicky's and they have assume Filipino food.  There is plenty seating inside if you want to dine in and avoid the riffraff on Ft. Street Mall.",
