The food is delicious with great portions, reasonable pricing and abundant selection. Great, very accommodating service in addition to everything else.  To owner Kurt Xu, my thanks for showing us that we don't have to visit Chinatown, Flushing in Queens or Sunset Park in Brooklyn to find the best Chinese restaurant in New York City. We just need to travel up Broadway on the Upper West Side, and it can be found right there once you reach W.105th St.",

We ordered $19.90+1.00 (rice) for two people at first, but a middle-aged, yellow-dyed hair Chinese waiter told us there is \"minimal charge rule\" so we order $2.00 more.  That's OK for us, although we haven't met such rule in New York, but please notice that the waiter agree with our price at that time. However, after lunch we are charged $28 by that waiter, so we argued with him and fortunately the manager was on our side, The manager said they have increased the price of one of the dish but the menu price hasn't been updated and the waiter forgot to told us. The manager is nice and he admitted it is their waiter's mistake, and he agreed to follow the original low price. We are happy with the manager, but then when that middle-aged, yellow-dyed hair Chinese waiter came to wiped our table, I heard something like \"f**k\" in Chinese. I don't know why we were getting insulted like this. We did nothing wrong, but we are humiliated. The waiter need more training in politeness and memory.",

The second time a similar thing happened: we ordered dishes along for the noodles to be served last and they were the first thing to arrive after the cold dishes. Finally, at 10pm on a Friday night they insisted we pay the check before finishing our food because they wanted to close out the register for the night.  Second, the some of the food was very disappointing. (Some was delicious, too.)

If you don't like or can handle spicy food you can tell waiter to make it less spicy or order the other foods without the spices.  The ox tongue and kidney are actually tasty if you're willing to try something exotic or can get over that is tongue and kidney.  The place is bigger than I thought and there is another section in the back part the kitchen.",

        "caption": "Update on my previous post: the next day, I call them again to put in the same order (I was sick and have to order delivery, and there is nothing else around that I really feel like eating..). They remembered the incident from the night before. Apparently the owner David found out about it, and had the restaurant figure out what went on - there was a computer problem, so my order never went into the kitchen. The guy (restaurant manager) took over the phone, explained and apologized. A day later, I also got phone call from the owner David to apologize again.  Overall, I appreciate their effort to correct their mistakes, and I still love their food. I decided to change my rating to reflect their food quality.  ------------- old post from 10/2/2015 ---------------------  First, I am a regular of this restaurant and I love the food there. However tonight the experience has been so terrible. I ordered a delivery, the lady said it will arrive in 1.5 hr since they're busy. I thought I am not that hungry so it's fine. 2 hrs later the food is still not here. So I called back and a lady (not sure if is the same one) picked up the phone and said it's not sent out but they will send out soon. I was a little mad but still said fine (cause I really crave for Chinese food!!). 2.5 hours later I got a call from a guy asking if I got my order, I told him no. He started to blame me not calling them even I didn't receive my order after so long. I told him I did call them, but he said neither of his two front desk ladies got my call.  It was outrageous, does he want to check my call history?! And why is it my duty to call him for my order anyway? He cancelled my order cause they were closing. No apology was given and he was very rude.",

However, they picked no weakness of Szechuan garden and liked it! General zhang beef is so fresh. House seafood is like garlic sauce, which is always delicious. Green pepper fish is good but not impressive. It's the best Szechuan restaurant that I have ever tried in US.",
