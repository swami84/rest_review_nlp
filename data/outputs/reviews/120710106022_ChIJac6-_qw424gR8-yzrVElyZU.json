Edit: Just a few things I want to add to clarify: (1) we did not know this was a communal seating area and would have never sat there if we were given a warning, (2) why should a communal table even be open during a pandemic? (3) if a \"community\" table is going to be open, shouldn't the people sitting there be respectful of others instead of refusing to take their feet off the table around food, cursing at us when we get more assertive, and laughing at our discontent?, and (4) we had to wait 20 extra minutes after requesting a manager to get any help",

        "caption": "Beer is good, as always, but the kitchen is very weak. Very limited menu, which is understandable, but not ideal. We ordered nachos with chorizo, and the smoked Mahi dip. The beer cheese on the nachos was fairly bland, and they had very little else in way of toppings. Literally maybe a tbsp of pico, with a dusting of chorizo, and about 5 slices of fresh jalapeno.  Literally worst nachos I've ever had, and I've ordered them at skating rinks lol. The Mahi dip was mostly mayo, and not great on flavor. It was served with 4 really nice crispy crackers, and oddly enough 4 stale saltine crackers...? Weird. Anyways, the food was not up to expectations of a craft brewery, and certainly not as good as Big Blue.  We'll give it another chance in maybe like 6 months, but there are much better places to eat and drink downtown Cape, so I recommend you patronize those places instead.",

I called them and was told \"I'll have an answer tomorrow\" so I would wait all the next day for them to call with no avail. I would call THEM them after a full day went by. Finally they asked for a  second interview with the regional manager. The questions from this interview were ridiculous... I understand an icebreaker questions but some of the questions I was asked were \"chocolate or vanilla?\" \"If you could have any super power, what would it be\" With very few real questions that I felt held any validity. Not to mention they conducted this interview in the middle of the lobby where any costomer could come in and distract or interrupt.(we were not interrupted but it was a very real possibility) They told me they wanted to speed the hiring process as fast as possible and I would be hearing from them very soon with an answer. Two full days go by and I didnt hear back. I decided to call the regional manager at the number he had on his buisness card. He did not answer, I left a message asking him to call me at his earliest convenience. I never heard back from this man, Travis, that interviewed me. The next day I called the shop I was directly attempting to apply at at, I was told to call back in 20 minutes when things calmed down as they were busy. I did, just to be told that they dont know and will have an answer for me the next day. I waited until about 8pm (the close at 9) to call them again with hopes of an answer, even a no would have been fine with me I just wanted real feedback. It rings, I hear them pick up and noise in the background then they hung up without a word. \"That's strange\" I think and call again. Same thing. I call for the 3rd and 4th time with the same problem. I think it's my phone and go to get my boyfriends phone to try again. FIVE TIMES IN A ROW THIS COMPANY HUNG UP ON ME WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD.  I have given up completely now, and shocker, still no call, that they promised me, letting me know whether I got the job or not.  Honestly I'm disappointed, I was looking forward to possibly  becoming a part of this team, over all the staff was friendly, aside from being hung up on, I didnt think they were rude, just unprofessional.",

The beer selection had a great variety of flavors! From super hoppy, malty varieties, to some lighter wheat based options. They even had a Gose, which not all breweries like to make!
