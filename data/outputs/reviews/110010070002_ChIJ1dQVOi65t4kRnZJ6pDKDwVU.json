The crust was bland and dry. Highlights were the pesto and buffalo sauces. The vegan wings were very dry and overcooked",

This means I have an immutable opinion on what means to be a good pizza, and I share it, often.  I also am a Barracks Row neighbor, excited to welcome new friends.  I visited Extreme Pizza Barracks Row Saturday afternoon, 2/27/21.  I was impressed by their conscientious Covid protocol; their courteous, friendly, efficient, and unfussy/family-friendly customer service; and the quality and pricing of their basic cheese pizza (I told you, there is only one pizza for me!).  The crust was a tad bit thicker than that of a NYC pizza, but it was yummy and cooked perfectly; and the ratio of crust, sauce, and cheese was perfect, and each component was fresh and tasty.  This definitely will be one of my only two go-to DMV pizza joints!  My only suggesed upgrades (I am a  New York expat, and a dog nut), first, if you do not already do so -- and I figure you do -- make sure to welcome well-behaved puppy family members to the patio, and second, put out a water bowl for your passerby neighbor pups.  Again, welcome to the neighborhood!",
