He also told me about the sesame salmon so I decided to get that which came with saut\u00e9ed veggies and I chose Mac & cheese as a side. Delicious!! The salmon was so flavorful, the veggies were mixed in with a nice sauce and the Mac was really cheesy with a slight crisp on top just how I like it. The other couple with us really enjoyed their food as well. Food came in a decent amount of time, very hot and fresh. There was no complaints! I recommend coming here during the week if you want a quiet night or during the weekend if you want a party/club scene. They also offer brunch which I am going to try out soon.",

We ordered appetizers & drinks a talked until our reservation was up. By 9pm, I asked the hostess 3x when we would be seated. She kept saying soon, but it wasn't until I asked the owner that we finally were given a table.  Once seated, we waited for what seemed like forever for service. It was our friend's birthday so we really wanted tonight to be nice for her, but the service just got worse as the night wore on. Our waitress took forever to address us, she never checked on us throughout the night & a lot of service went to the outdoor area. Perhaps this is why we were made to wait so long for service inside! My first 2 times here were phenomenal! I had a blast! The food was really good, the dj & whole vibe was on point! I don't know what happened tonight. Not only was the service NOT good, but there were TOO MANY people there! To boot, our waitress took so long to bring our check, that we had to go to the bar on our way out to close our bill. Hush better get it together or they may be hushed!",

The answer is I wanted to know exactly how long was a waiter going to come! Not soon after wqiters did show just NOT FOR HOUR TABLE! THE FIRST PICTURE U SEE WERE DRUNKS THAT WERE BOUGHT AT THE BAR ! AT THAT POINT I WAS JUST COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED! All the beautiful reviews and we had to walk to the bar to order food to go and our own drinks !

It\u2019s a nice lowkey Jamaican restaurant I hope they grow more over time . They play music but it\u2019s not too much where you can\u2019t hear the person you\u2019re with talking .

The staff was also very friendly and personable. It's not too big or small, just the right size. This place gets 2 thumbs up for me. Can't wait to go back.",

Took almost an hour for the food to arrive at the table.  Would never in life return to this place. They call it Hush  for a reason.  And the service is no good.  Just all around  terrible place .",

The menu is perfect, something for everyone. My favorite is the lobster and shrimp fried rice and the seafood special on Wednesday\u2019s is to die for !!! I\u2019m not much of a drinker, however I tried the hush cocktail and it was very refreshing. For a Caribbean restaurant, I absolutely love the diversity of the workers and the professionalism they displayed. The service was superb!!!! I highly recommend this restaurant.",
