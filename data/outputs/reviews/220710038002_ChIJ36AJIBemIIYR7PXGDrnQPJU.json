After waiting in line for a long time, the lady at the counter was rude, while taking my order she stopped several times to talk to other people who had been standing in line behind me and my family.  Then she asked me to sit at a nearby table so that she could deliver our food but then when the food was ready about 30 minutes later, she had us pick it up ourselves.  I had already paid and tipped the restaurant 20%.  My family and I will never visit Alberto's again and will definitely not recommend it to our friends.",
