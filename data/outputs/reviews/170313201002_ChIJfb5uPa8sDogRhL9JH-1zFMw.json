        "caption": "Subway is subway but this one is the worst!  Food is as expected.  I used to go in the a.m. before work to get the breakfast combo.  Even if you are the only one in the store, it takes forever...they are always short staffed.  Today was the last straw.  I order the ham, egg and cheese combo and there is no egg on the sandwich making bar so she has to go get some out of the freezer and I have to wait till it defrosts in the microwave. OK, typical. Then she tells me they have no ham, but I cannot substitute because its a combo so I switch to bacon.  Whatever.  Once my sandwich is heated I ask for lettuce tomato and onion and they are out of tomato.  Are you kidding me? You're a sandwich shop!",
