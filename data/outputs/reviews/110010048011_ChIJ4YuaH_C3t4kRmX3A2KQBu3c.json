I think it is difficult for them to run the business from Bowie while they wait for the regular location to, hopefully, open again. They've always had a long wait time for food. An hour is not uncommon. So just know that you will have to work hard and be patient to get this food!  Having said that, no West African restaurant in the DMV comes close to Sumah. Ok, I haven't tried them all, but I've tried a lot. The food at Sumah is worth the trouble. Their stew is the best. Their egusi is the best. Their plantains are the best. They used to make their own ginger beer. Idk if they still do. I used to order it by the gallon!  They are also kind and straightforward. When I first ate at the Shaw location, they gave me a plate with a sample of every stew to try. This place is run like they are passionate about the food, but winging it a bit with the rest of the business. And, honestly, I find it charming. The food is the important part, so 5 stars.",

A must for anyone who wishes to tantalize their taste buds with the flavors of Africa, and enjoy a hearty good meal!  Sumah is a lovely and joyful man - he will make you feel at home!  My husband and I are visiting DC this weekend, and ate at Sumah's West African Restaurant, yesterday (Friday) having been recommended by one of the front desk staff at the hotel we are staying at. This front desk staff happened to be caucasian - needless to say I was pleased to learn that she enjoys West African cuisine.  Upon arrival at Sumah's restaurant Sumah was very friendly, and learning that this was our first time coming he arranged a sampler plate filled with all the dishes from his menu! He made us feel very welcome.  His restaurant was busy full of customers from various cultural backgrounds, and he and his staff were very jovial and welcoming.  We ordered pounded yam with egusi soup, as well as jollof rice with fried plantains, peanut stew and cassava leaves. We had the option of proteins to include, goat meat, chicken or fish. We drank a West African Ginger drink to accompany our meal. It was an amazing taste sensation and a culinary delight!  We will be visiting again on our next trip to DC!",

Tonight, I went there again, hoping to grab dinner on my way home. I patiently waited by the queue of people at the counter and was told to sit down. I sat down and then was told to move for a couple there when there were other open tables for them to sit, so I left. I give up on trying to give them another chance. Crappy customer service, long wait time, decent West African food, albeit a little oily depending on your preference. But I really didn\u2019t like not being asked, but being told to move with no apology or anything after being told to sit initially.  Not my cup of tea. This last time was the worst.",

They don't greet longtime customers, don't inform you of your position in line, act surly when there's a concern being brought up, and etc... Warning!!! If you order your food over the phone they won't prepare it. I've dealt patiently w/ their poor customer service for years. Good food... Horrible customer service.  To be fair and objective about this whole thing... I've sat back and watched this place treat it's primarily professional class Black patron like trash for almost 12 years. This restaraunt has only survived due to an influx newcomers who eat there leave a great review about their food but never have to deal w/ them again. LONG TIME RESIDENTS AND NATIVES of this area know to beware of this business. The wife is the surliest of the whole bunch and the owner is almost as bad. I've been perfectly honest when saying that this restaraunt has the worst customer service I've ever experienced.",

As soon, as we walked in we were greeted with smiles & because this was our first time here we were offered samples of every single dish; which I thought was very generous. The price ranges are not too bad ($14-$17), compared to other African Restaurant establishments. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have good & reasonably priced authentic West African food with good vibes!",

Arrived there at 2:30 and was told I had to wait another 15 minutes which meant another 30 min. I was pissed. I have to be at work at 4pm! Why wasn't I told this on the phone. Instead of an apology I was told I was wrong for being upset. These are some really rude people with a poor idea of what customer service means. Left with no apology and no food.

It took a long time for us to be seated (like 10 min of being ignored) and way longer for the waitress to come over to get our order. She brought a sample plate since my friend never had west African food before. I loved getting to taste everything so that I could see which dishes they really do well. We ended up ordering pepper soup (with cow foot), egusi, and palava sauce. All of it was AMAZING!! I also tried the ginger juice since I wasn\u2019t aware it was BYOB and neglected to bring a bottle.

You go to Sumah\u2019s for really good authentic African food. It\u2019s pricey, but worth it and he\u2019s a wonderful business owner. It is family run, not a chain. The cultural divide unfortunately has a lot of entitled Americans feeling as though maybe they should be treated like royalty for being a patron,  but often times they don\u2019t want to give respect to receive it. I can say that as a regular customer, I have never been disappointed by the food and that any negative experience related to treatment is probably promoted by a pompous and arrogant individual who was first disrespectful.

I've brought my mother (who visited from CA), my professors, countless amount of friends, and supervisors to this establishment. Unfortunately, today will be the last day that I support Sumah and his raggedy restaurant.  Earlier today I ordered a plate of food (joloff rice with 3 stews) and made sure to specify that I did not want \"BEEF\" and only wanted chicken as my meat selection. Unfortunately, when I arrived home, I noticed my meal did not include the chicken that I asked for.  I immediately called Sumah and tried to explain the situation. Instead of his wife admitting that she misunderstood my \"no beef\" request, Sumah's wife decided to argue with me over the phone. She finally hands the phone to Sumah and he immediately tells me to bring the plate back.  When I arrive-- instead of a pleasant \" sorry for the inconvenience\" or \"sorry for the misunderstanding\" Sumah and his wife approaches the counter with a DISGUSTING attitude. Sumah then begins to patronize me by saying that if I want chicken I should give him an additional $2. I tried to explain to Sumah that I left my home without my wallet because I thought it would be a quick transaction. Sumah then tells me to go back home and bring him $2!!!!! Excuse me??? I just spent $18 on a plate of food from your establishment, not to mention the $35 my friend and I spent literally the week before (literally 6 days ago)-- and you're worried about 2 freaking dollars!!?!?!!? I politely ask the wife for my money back and she proceeds to tell me \"no\" after she lies about me seeing that there was no chicken initially placed in my plate.  Not wanting to cause a scene in front of their non-Black/African customers (who they clearly value more than the customers who look like them [information gathered from several of their previous reviews]) I tell the wife that I will be posting a Yelp review about the establishment and I proceed to leave. As I am walking down the street, Sumah chases me to my car and tells me \"IF YOU LEAVE THE YELP REVIEW DO NOT COME BACK. IN FACT, WHEN YOU'RE DONE CALL CNN!\"  After over 6 years of being a loyal customer, supporting a Black owned business directly and indirectly, you would think the owner would be understanding and more accommodating. Sumah and his wife are UNPROFESSIONAL, DISGUSTING, DISLOYAL business owners. They care nothing about the community that supports them and are only concerned about money. **Please give your money to business owners that value you as much as they value your money.**",

All this incident erupts as a results of trying to tell him gently he could not take my order 2-3 meters from where I was sitting with very unprofessional manners. His reaction was completely disproportionate and uncalled for. When people start making few bucks, they forget the essence of business: service to fellow humans! He asked me if I knew who he was and I responded by asking him if he was Donald Trump! How sad!",

The meal didn't taste that bad but there were broken chicken bones in the food and partly little splitter of bones. It's absolutely not made for families with children. We ate from plastic bowls which normally are made for takeaway food. We had plastic cutlery and plastic Cups. At least I cant say anything against the owner of the \"restaurant\"( which doesn't really look like one neither from outdoor nor from indoor) because they had been friendly. But 20$ for that food?! Honestly that is too much!",

Way over price in my opinion. I prefer Zion Kitchen and Kitchen Near You's service and food quality much better, and they are cheaper.",

To be clear, the place is not much to look at, and many people may be turned off by the location and facilities. However, West African food is a truly unique cuisine that is a rare gem to come by, and Sumah is a fine example.  I spent years living in West Africa and came to love the flavor and spice of their food. It is almost impossible to find good food from this region in the US. DC has several options, but I believe Sumah's to be the best.  This particular style comes from Guinea/ Sierra Leone and makes heavy use of palm oil in their dishes. I love the peanut sauce and the leaf sauce here!  The owner and his family have lived in the States for many years now but come from this region. In fact, I've been to his home village, and the food here smacks of authenticity.  Nowadays, it seems like you can get food from anywhere in the US, but if you're looking for a one-of-a-kind culinary experience, give this place a try.",

Please don't be put off by the \"minimalist\" decor. Mr Sumah was incredibly hospitable and gracious. He offered us samples of the sauces and was very accommodating of our various dietary requirements. Our family-style meal was unbelievably delicious! For about $20 per person - including homemade ginger beer, fried plantains, and tax & tip - we left full and carrying leftovers for another meal. Mr Sumah even hailed us a taxi back to our hotel.

Now, to be honest it is a hole in the wall local type of place that doesn't look that impressive, but for me I prefer to walk into a place and see that everyone else there is obviously West African.  That usually means the food is good!  After spending time in Benin, Ghana, and Liberia, this definitely brought back memories.  The lady was kind enough to make a sampler plate for us to try the different sauces.  They were all amazing and it took us awhile to decide which ones to try.  We were able to pick a choice of two sauces which was nice!  There was enough food for multiple meals of leftovers.  The ginger beer was also delicious!  The various people in our party who were from West Africa were impressed as well as those who had never eaten West African food. One thing I will caution though is that they do not truly have vegetarian food.  My friend who is vegetarian ordered her dishes without meat, but realized later that there were small bits of meat in the sauce.  They probably cook the meat in the sauce and just dipped around it.",

The plantains are a treat too, very tasty and a huge portion - value for money!  When the food arrives, it's plentiful - I've gotten two meals out of it and still have leftovers!
