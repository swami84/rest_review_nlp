The decor is minimal but the place overall has a nice, bright atmosphere.  As for the food, it's classic American-Chinese food done right, and better than a lot of chinese places I've been to in Chicago!  Very flavorful, and less oily than I expected.  I enjoyed the chow fun a lot, and the dumplings were delicious.  The soups were also great!  Overall a great place that I will be coming back to (and ordering takeout from)!",
