Same with entre\u00e8s, they even have Kashmiri dish Rogan Josh which is my favourite and they absolutely got it right. So great variety and top quality tasty dishes, this gets every establishment a solid 4 from me, but they also have hip, modern and schick presentation AND very polite, helpful staff which go above and beyond to make sure patrons have a good experience.

The biggest draw for me was that they offer Impossible meat-alternative options.  I've gotten the Impossible masala (pictured) and I've gotten the Impossible korma and both were seriously yummy.  Try these over their basmati rice with a side of garlic naan (pictured) & you can't go wrong.  The last time my husband & I ordered from here, we had half of each meal leftover, so we had it for lunch the next day which made me feel like my money was going further!  Adding Impossible jacks the price up a fair amount, however, I'm grateful to have a meat substitute option if I want it.  The chana saag is also unreal.  Creamy saag, with wonderfully spiced chickpeas mixed in & a touch of spice that'll leave you sweating.  Yum!  The times I've taken out from Tikka the people inside have been pleasant & helpful!

The pumpkin Chana, black pepper chicken, lamb Chennai, and the appetizers were all particularly good. The prices were good. The wait staff were very friendly.  This one is a keeper.",

My very favorite dish so far is the pumpkin kala chana, which is also little spicier than other dishes. The samosas are excellent.
