There are a lot of restaurants! But Richards has won a special place in our weekly rotation since our first visit about 6 weeks ago. We have had business dinners there and dates. We have had most of the dishes (except for those with mushrooms as I can't eat those) and find them consistently excellent - the bison and duck are probably favorites.  Salads and sides are great, too - the kale salad is best in class, brussel sprouts are excellent.  And the desserts! They have amazing desserts, focus on quality and inventiveness, and are a perfect size for an after dinner treat that doesn't give you a sugar hangover. Home-made ice cream sandwich, exquisite ice-creams. The bar is also excellent - creative cocktails and standards made perfectly, a very nice wine list. I am super picky about bars so this put Richards over the top. Service is excellent.",

Richard and Sarah Graham and their team were great hosts on our first visit and we\u2019re looking forward to visiting regularly. Their reasonably priced menu is creative: their risotto and truffle with crab was amazing. And what they\u2019ve done with the space fits their plan to serve really great food in a comfortable neighborhood setting.
