        "caption": "I placed an order on Friday 1/1/20 at around 8:00pm and an hour and a half later the food came. I paid in cash.  When I opened up the pizza, it wasn't a pan pizza as I ordered. I forgave this first error and when I grabbed one of the unevenly cut slices, tomato sauce began to pour out like soup (didn't ask for extra sauce). I then opened up the cinnamon twist that where cold, burned, and had no cinnamon/sugar on it. I called to complain and was immediately transferred to a manager who tried to justify all the errors instead of trying to rectify them. He got defensive and rude and agreed to only replace the cinnamon twist with the condition that I return the item original cinnamon twist (as if he was imply i was just trying to get free food). This was at around 9:30pm. He assured me the replacement would take 45 minutes to an hour, and the quality would be better,  but because how disrespectful he was to me in that conversation, I still made a complaint. 3hrs later and after 3 rudely handled follow up calls in between, I then decide to cancel the order. I asked for a refund that they said they already returned but I knew that would be impossible due to the fact that I paid in cash. I tried to explain that but they continued to hang up on me. I then received an incoming call tell me that I would get a refund but to no longer call that store for service because \"they don't want my type of customer.\" I then left the comfort of my home to go there directly to get my refund, and return the food item that they told me to return to them as sort of proof that I wasn't trying to get free food, even though I have ordered dominoes many times before. I arrived around 1:30am. I asked for the managers name and I was lied to and told that they didn't know his name. Then I was told they where closed even though the door was propped wide open and the posted closing hours on the door for Fri and Sat was 3:00am. Then I recorded the interaction as proof which prompted the employee, that was lying to me, to go get his phone and to record me, as if he was the customer with the bad experience, or to scare me into leaving. Then he called the police on me, even though I didn't do anything wrong and lied telling them I was threatening him with a knife. Because I had already recorded the incident in its totality, I wasn't going to be intimidated, and stayed there while recording him make false allegations to the 911 operator. When the police responded, me and the employee that called, ended up having to go to the 67th precinct for 3hrs for him to then tell them that I in fact never threatened him and it was a miss understanding. All of this because I was dissatisfied with the service. I can with full confidence say that the treatment I received had alot to do with my race and the race of the people that they service, which is why they feel that they don't have to be respectful. And in a climate that has seen an increase in the killing of unarmed black men, was calling the police and making a false allegation on an African American male with a customer complaint appropriate? This man put my life in danger. There is little diversity on their staff which is part of the problem. I have full video of the incident. I'm just glad I didn't become a headline over a customer service complaint. I have contacted corporate and have yet to hear back. If I could give negative stars i would because they don't even deserve 1 star. I even had a delivery man deliver food to me from this same location while smoking a cigarette and letting smoke blow in my face and I am a non smoker. What is even more shocking is that after reviewing the complaints accumulated at this location, over a 5 year period, that corporate hasn't done anything to change what's happening there, and that in my opinion that is gross negligence.",

The second time I called and someone answered after another 10 minutes. They asked for my phone number, repeated back the wrong number and claimed it was on the way. There's no way they could have checked on it because the number was completely different than the one I used to order. After 3 hours and at least 6 phone calls I finally got in contact with the store. They again claimed the order was on the way. When I stated I didn't want it anymore they hung up on me. I called back and was hung up on twice more. After the 4th time they answered and I again requested a refund which they said they couldn't give because my order was already on the way. 5 minutes later a driver called and said he just left the store with my order. I'm confused as to how that can be when they said it couldn't be refunded because it was on the way an hour before. During the first 2 calls that actually went through the person was rude. The third time he sighed, sucked his teeth then gave the phone to another person. As long as this is my default store I will never order from Dominoes again. Did not have this issue at my previous location. I wish I could give them 0 stars.",

I waited, I looked through the window, I went downstairs back and forth. Still no pizza, no call, and my home is like 15 minutes drive away. Finally and 40 minutes later I finally got someone to pick up the phone at the store after several called with no answers. She was like we have a lot of delivery and the driver will call you when he get there. I asked her what kind of pizza they were bringing because it\u2019s already almost 2 hours since they left, plus myself and my child is starving and I started making something from my freezer, and she should refund my card and don\u2019t bother. She was like we will refund your card when the pizza returned. I made ate, relaxed and stopped looking out. The next morning I got a survey asking how was my pizza? I sent them two messages that I never received it, nor get any call and they should refund my card. I called the store 3 days straight with no one picking up, finally monday evening someone pick up but hung up on me as soon as I said my name. I\u2019m done calling them, my card still has not gotten refunded. I\u2019m gonna call my bank, or do whatever it take to get my refund. They are disgusting and hope the stupid busy they ran shut down. One think they\u2019re not going to do is take my money and don\u2019t deliver. Someone there is a thief or they are scammer.",

Nevertheless, we still continued to order from here. What really did it for me though, was that the last order I placed, I never got. Wasted my money on food I didn't even get to eat. Spoke to the assistant manager who said he would refund me my money TWO HOURS after I had placed my order, and after calling four times and being hung up on every single time. And did I ever get my refund? Nope. I never received anything. The customer service here is just trash. Save yourself the money and the hassle and order from somewhere else.",

My order was $55 and for me to have spent that much money in food I would assume that my order would be correct since I\u2019ve spent this much money. Well, I was wrong, pasta was dry, two orders of boneless chicken was burnt, cheesy bread was burnt and the wrong bread as well, Philly cheesesteak burnt with hardly no protein in the sandwich, paid for all this extra sauce and got all the wrong sauce. The next day I called this store only to constantly be placed on hold for 30 minutes or more and to also have someone pick up the line only to hang up on me. so now for 4 days this is what I have been dealing with as well as trying to get in contact with cooperate to no avail.

I\u2019ve had messed up pizza. I\u2019ve had pizza that was cold. Are used my 60 points to get a free pie and they didn\u2019t deliver it. I couldn\u2019t get my points back. This location has all kinds of crazy things happening. The very few times that I had good service, it was great. I don\u2019t know what happens?

If the order is incorrect, there is no proof that you bought it from there.  I ordered online and never received my order. I had to go to the store the following day to dispute the transaction because the manager hung up on me over the phone. When i get there they tell me i ordered for a pickup although I have the delivery confirmation on my phone. When the refund was supposedly done i was not given a refund receipt or confirmation. Instead the manager called \"Soumic\" reproduced an in-store receipt of \"unpaid\" items from the exact date and time of my order. I had to call my bank with a dispute to get my money back 8 days later.  This Domino's made my blood boil that day.",

        "caption": "Ordered 3 medium pepperoni pizzas, 14 piece wings, and 2 liter Sprite Sat., November 23, 2019 from the 241 Rockaway Brooklyn Location. The order was completed online. We were advised by the tracker that our order would be ready for pickup at 7:28pm. Received a text advising our order would be ready in 8-10 minutes, we left the house as dominos is only 3-5 minutes away from our home. Once we arrived at Dominos the customers already in the store were in upset because one person had sat as early as 6:30pm waiting for a sandwich that they didn't receive until almost 8:00pm. It was pure chaos, people were enraged by the lack of customer service and it seemed like a number of orders were sent out for delivery instead of prioritizing the customers who waited in the store. We sat and waited for almost an hour for food that was horribly presented at 8:16pm in boxes that looked dismantled. Once the orders were checked one of the pizzas looked uncooked in the center, the other had an obscene amount of grease, and the third one had what appeared to be a white substance on the crust. Not to mention the chicken wings were done at the original pick up time almost an hour before our pizzas were completed. We were so upset with the order and overall customer service we left leaving the food at the establishment, forced to spend our money elsewhere due to the horrible customer experience we received this evening. This needs to be fixed promptly, training needs to go into affect immediately even when answering the phone! This location lacks the fundamentals of putting their customers first and etiquette. Strongly advise corporate to get involved before this location goes out of business.",

We Waited patiently An hour later when the pizza did not arrive we called the store they told us that the driver did not want to drive to deliver the pizza. Nobody called us to let us know. This is a Very unprofessional place and based on the previous reviews and my own experience it\u2019s  not only is the customer service lacking but also the decency to call somebody and let them know that they would not deliver. I use to be a fan of Domino\u2019s but after this I Will never order dominos again!",

After waiting for 90 (for what was supposed to be 30-40 min delivery), the online tracker said the order was delivered when it was not. When we called the store we were on hold for over 30 mins before someone answered the phone. The staff tried to claim that the delivery person called, even through our phone had not rang at all. They said the delivery would arrive in 5-10 mins, yet we continued to wait for an additional 30 mins just for the driver to drive past our house. When our food arrived it was far from hot. As someone who is a manager in customer service, there is nothing about this transaction that I find acceptable. Looking at other customer reviews this type of thing seems to be a constant. I sincerely hope that Dominos the company takes a serious look at this location and does something to improve performance.",

Ended up finding the box with the right label but it was empty. Waited again. Meanwhile a guy came in saying he'd been waiting two hours for delivery and decided to just walk in and pick up. Another guy came in complaining too. I waited a full 35 minutes from the time the order was supposedly done till I got it. Walked 5 minutes home only to find out the pizza was cold! It was there all along!! How can you not find a pizza you just made?! ABSOLUTE INCOMPETENCE. And there were at least 8 guys running around blabbering and doing God knows what. Not succeeding at what should be fairly easy tasks, obviously. NEVER AGAIN. CONTACTING CORPORATE!!",

Of course there was no sauces delivered, and the driver said it wasn\u2019t his job to make sure the sauces were there and to call. I called 5 times no answer, so I went there. On top of not getting the sauces my food was cold and hard. In the dominoes location they were rude, short and unapologetic. And while I was there I saw one of their managers take the phone off the hook as it rang uncontrollably. I initially went in to get sauces, ended up getting a refund instead.

The excuse this time was that they gave away my pizza to someone else and had to redo it! This place is TRASH. The employees are rude  and unprofessional. There is little to no supervision and everyone pretty much does what they want. The store manager did nothing to remedy the situation once we explained to him. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN! Poor excuse for a franchise.",

        "caption": "They\u2019re only getting 1 star because this is the lowest I can go. If I could I would give negative infinity stars. Here was how my experience was: I placed an order at Dominos Store 3668 around 8:46pm on Tuesday July 31st. At 9:05pm, the pizza tracker told me that my driver had left the store and was on his way. At 9:50pm, I still hadn\u2019t received my food and I\u2019m less than a mile away from the store. It would take maybe 10 minutes to drive to me. So I called the store only to be met with a rude worker who told me that the tracker was wrong, my driver just left and is on his way, and she hung up on me. \u2022 THEN, at 10:40, I STILL hadn\u2019t received my food so I called again. I was told that my driver forgot my pizza. This means that my pizza has just been sitting around for 2 hours. The woman said she was sorry and would include a free drink in my delivery. \u2022 Even after calling a second time, I didn\u2019t receive my order until 11:30. Which I would have been okay with because I was thinking they could have been making me a fresh order, which is what they should do. BUT NO. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. My order arrived almost 3 HOURS AFTER I ORDERED IT and was cold! They gave me the same pizza that had been sitting out for 2 hours instead of making me a hot and fresh order. They didn\u2019t even attempt to heat it up! Not to mention, I didn\u2019t receive the free drink I was promised. \u2022 And even with all of this, I tipped with my card when I ordered online because I didn\u2019t have sufficient cash on me, so my driver just received a 20% tip that he didn\u2019t deserve. \u2022 This store is horrible. I would NEVER suggest to anyone to order from there and I don\u2019t think I will ever again. If I ever order from here again, i\u2019ll order for pickup and Uber over because I dont trust their delivery and their ability to actually carry out an order if I weren\u2019t standing in front of them. Terrible service. Probably some of the worse service I have ever had. I\u2019m sooooo upset I just paid to receive old and cold food.  I have NO idea how such a major corporation like dominos could allow a store with such terrible reviews and a store below 4 stars to stay open. Let alone 1.6!!! I don\u2019t think that corporate is aware of what is going on but I\u2019m going to make sure that they do. This is unacceptable. The employees there are incompetent and will basically steal from you because you\u2019re not getting what you paid for. If I hadn\u2019t called back the second time, I would have never gotten my food. Which honestly almost would have been better since it was terrible. Corporate needs to FIRE everyone or better yet, shut this location down. Unacceptable. NEVER order from here.",

I wouldn't recommend delivery; I live four minutes away by car but yet it took them a whole hour and some minutes, and I still did not get my order. The driver felt the need to curse at me on the phone, especially, \"CLAUDY\", he is very disrespectful. The manger had no decency  to do something it's like she didn't care. Yesterday, was my last day ordering here I would not trust them with my food. I REPEAT STAY AWAY FROM THIS DOMINOS.",
