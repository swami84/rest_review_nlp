Thankfully, the food was steaming hot (not always a given - see recent Florence, AL Italian restaurant's review).

I went back to give the tip, and the same woman was at the counter. I noticed the same attitude my daughter described. Typically, if someone makes the effort to come back to give a tip, they would be at least thanked. No evidence of gratitude whatsoever. I did not have to go back to give that tip, and sort of wished I hadn't. When we got home, both entrees were luke warm, and the pizza was rubbery - not something we'd expect for a $48 bill (including tip).",

So no excuse not to have enough staff (on a Sunday at 6:30. Not a typically busy time).

It was nearly empty when we went in and the employees didnt seem interested in the few customers that were there. No one greeted us when we walked in and I didnt know we could seat ourselves.  They have a variety of paninis, pasta dishes, calzones, and pizza on the menu. Some pizzas are named with preset ingredients ($11-15).  you can create your own as well (base $11 and $1.50 each additional topping)The menu states gluten free options available for calzones and pizza. I do not know if its gluten free or if cross contamination could happen in the kitchen. You can see the guys prepping the pizza crusts in the back which was curious. I ordered a named pizza and adjusted the toppings a little ($11). I also ordered a half house salad ($4)  and a sparkling pomerita ($9)  The kids got a cheese pizza and drink for $7.  The pizza was delicious and perfectly done. It was about the size of a 10 inch dinner plate, even the kid pizza. It was served hot from the oven and was still hot after 10 minutes. The crust was perfectly done. Crisp to bite and slightly chewy. I will definitely make another stop here when I'm back in Huntsville. My kids said they want to make it a tradition to visit before their annual gymnastics comeptition. Dont judge a book by its cover on this one!",

There were two other tables with menus and utensils laid out for 6:30 reservations. The table we were slated for still had 2 people sitting down, eating their meal. It was a 4-top and we were a group of 6. None of it made sense, and despite our persistence, no headway was made. So they were able to reserve a specific table for some groups but not for all. The manager was not helpful and her responses to my wife were quite rude. We waited around for 15 minutes while other large parties were seated. After waiting, we made a phone call to another restaurant and left. The managers response and the staff\u2019s inability to hold the reservation, which truly is the most important part of the reservation, was enough for me to cross this one off our list for good.",

My pizza was ok and was not anything special. The pizza tasted plain and as if there wasn't a lot of effort put into making it. The chicken alfredo came out cold and the chicken was not cooked all the way as if they pieces were pulled out of the freezer and were not thawed during the cooking process. The reason I give two stars instead of one is because the manager took the chicken alfredo off our bill. Nonetheless, we left Pane E Vino very unsatisfied and disappointed.",

I recommend going to Sam n Gregs or even Carabas for more authentic Italian cuisine. There are bugs swarming, and living under the tables.

Service was a bit slow, but they were slammed and we weren't in a rush. Food was GREAT and they also have great drinks. Drinks pictured on the right side of the pic are the Italian Margarita (orange) and the clear skies (clear). Meal pictured is the chicken carbonara pasta, which was great! Will definitely return to Pane E Vino as long as I dont have a time constraint!",

We have heard great things about this little place and  had no problems at all they have a very nice menu we don't drink much anymore but they have a really good selection of wine for those that do. And the views of the park are a plus as well. Wish we would have tried them sooner as we visit the park and Art museum frequently we just never tried them until now.",
