Thankfully, the food was steaming hot (not always a given - see recent Florence, AL Italian restaurant's review).

I went back to give the tip, and the same woman was at the counter. I noticed the same attitude my daughter described. Typically, if someone makes the effort to come back to give a tip, they would be at least thanked. No evidence of gratitude whatsoever. I did not have to go back to give that tip, and sort of wished I hadn't. When we got home, both entrees were luke warm, and the pizza was rubbery - not something we'd expect for a $48 bill (including tip).",

So no excuse not to have enough staff (on a Sunday at 6:30. Not a typically busy time).

It was nearly empty when we went in and the employees didnt seem interested in the few customers that were there. No one greeted us when we walked in and I didnt know we could seat ourselves.  They have a variety of paninis, pasta dishes, calzones, and pizza on the menu. Some pizzas are named with preset ingredients ($11-15).  you can create your own as well (base $11 and $1.50 each additional topping)The menu states gluten free options available for calzones and pizza. I do not know if its gluten free or if cross contamination could happen in the kitchen. You can see the guys prepping the pizza crusts in the back which was curious. I ordered a named pizza and adjusted the toppings a little ($11). I also ordered a half house salad ($4)  and a sparkling pomerita ($9)  The kids got a cheese pizza and drink for $7.  The pizza was delicious and perfectly done. It was about the size of a 10 inch dinner plate, even the kid pizza. It was served hot from the oven and was still hot after 10 minutes. The crust was perfectly done. Crisp to bite and slightly chewy. I will definitely make another stop here when I'm back in Huntsville. My kids said they want to make it a tradition to visit before their annual gymnastics comeptition. Dont judge a book by its cover on this one!",

There were two other tables with menus and utensils laid out for 6:30 reservations. The table we were slated for still had 2 people sitting down, eating their meal. It was a 4-top and we were a group of 6. None of it made sense, and despite our persistence, no headway was made. So they were able to reserve a specific table for some groups but not for all. The manager was not helpful and her responses to my wife were quite rude. We waited around for 15 minutes while other large parties were seated. After waiting, we made a phone call to another restaurant and left. The managers response and the staff\u2019s inability to hold the reservation, which truly is the most important part of the reservation, was enough for me to cross this one off our list for good.",

My pizza was ok and was not anything special. The pizza tasted plain and as if there wasn't a lot of effort put into making it. The chicken alfredo came out cold and the chicken was not cooked all the way as if they pieces were pulled out of the freezer and were not thawed during the cooking process. The reason I give two stars instead of one is because the manager took the chicken alfredo off our bill. Nonetheless, we left Pane E Vino very unsatisfied and disappointed.",

I recommend going to Sam n Gregs or even Carabas for more authentic Italian cuisine. There are bugs swarming, and living under the tables.

Service was a bit slow, but they were slammed and we weren't in a rush. Food was GREAT and they also have great drinks. Drinks pictured on the right side of the pic are the Italian Margarita (orange) and the clear skies (clear). Meal pictured is the chicken carbonara pasta, which was great!

She came to the table (she, the host, was kind and apologetic) so we ordered. The food took forever to come out and when it finally came, it was completely cold and one of the dishes was not what we ordered. As someone who works in the industry, I never complain about bad food or service but this was unbelievable!.... the restaurant wasn\u2019t even that busy. I understand being understaffed, but there is no excusing clearly reheated pasta and nowhere-to-be-found service. We asked for the manager and the person, who I suspect was not an actual manager, did apologize and try to make it right by offering to remake our food but we weren\u2019t about to keep the place open as at this point they were closing. whoever owns this place should probably consider better staffing their establishment, training their kitchen and having an actual manager on premise to deal with issues. will not be giving this place another try. It\u2019s a joke of a business. Such a shame, as the view is amazing but doesn\u2019t make up for the short comings. Save your time and money.. go somewhere else",

Our waiter seemed insulted (or desired to try insulting me?) after I asked if we paid at the counter or the table (He smirked \"Oh, I thought you had been here before...you seemed to know the menu.\"  We had been there before...plenty of times...but he ignored the credit card sitting on top of our bare ticket --no jacket provided, which is often a sign that one pays at the door-- for so long I thought payout may have changed).  From seating to leaving took almost 2 hours---we waited 10min for drinks, 45min for food because our ticket \"got lost\" in the kitchen (including my salad which came out about 7min before our entrees), 15min after we'd finished eating to receive the  ticket and 10min for him to process our payment and return the card. Found out during this nearly 2 hours that the waiter suffers from short term memory loss (lost ticket?), that he was tired since he had been working \"since 9a\" (it was 6:40pm when this comment was made), and that \"customers who know the menu are his favorites.\"  Go in with lowered expectations and maybe you'll be surprised! --------------------------------- I phoned in an order to pick up a piece of their delicious limoncello dessert.  I arrived 6-8 minutes later and then waited another 5 minutes to receive it, despite being the only one at the counter.  They are always busy and do good business.  The food is fantastic, but absolutely prepare to wait, whether you're dining in or picking up.  Quality is sometimes worth a wait.",

We couldn't move because it's so small we felt if we had of moved it wouldn't be any better. I ordered a pizza it was really good I loved it. But my husband didn't like his food too much he said it was dry and bland so he pretty much shared my food with me. Our waitress was missing in action. She was polite but never came over to check on us mainly to refill our drinks or anything. I personally think this place is more likely for mature kids who can sit and feed themselves. If I did go back it would be just me and my husband not the kids and hopefully it become a better experience.",

The waiters had indoor and outdoor seating so the split seating was somehow too difficult and we had to find her several times to get refills. That\u2019s mostly management\u2019s fault so I let that slide. What pissed me off though was that an hour and 45 min later we got our food. My 3 year old only got 3 bites of his baked Ziti and ate his breadstick as we ran across the park to the center. His order didn\u2019t come out with ours. The waitress said it got stuck behind some pizzas but I know that\u2019s code for \u201cthe cooks or I forgot that order\u201d. The rest of us got to eat but our calzones were severely undercooked and soggy. I\u2019m forever ruined from that place.",

The hustle around the restaurant is cleaning up and starting to make me feel uncomfortable as workers rush by without eye contact. I wait and the manager who has a shaved head walks by me at 8:53 pm. He glanced down at my table where my phone laid  and walked by me.. now he is standing near  the front door looking at his watch , taps it and says in a loud voice \u201c come on let\u2019s shut the place down now! Let\u2019s get this place cleaned up and get out of here\u201d, all the while looking at his watch.. NEVER have I been made to feel so uncomfortable in a restaurant. He didn\u2019t bother to let me know they weren\u2019t serving, apologize, anything.. things like that really don\u2019t bother me much. Tonight? It did, it hit me wrong, wrong enough to make a difference. To post this, to never step foot in that place... so I\u2019m sitting here at Ruth\u2019s Chris where I was welcomed,, I\u2019ve been here at closing multiple times and got a smile and full service..

I arrived to pick up the pizzas at 6:00 and the first person I talked to couldn't even find a ticket for the pizzas. I came to find out that the pizzas hadn't even been started yet. I overheard two of the workers basically saying it was silly for us to expect them to set a 3+ hour timer in order to remind them to have pizzas made by 6. Nobody in the restaurant communicated to me what was happening (although I knew from overhearing them) so I asked again about my pizzas. One of the workers explained that when the morning workers left they didn't tell the night workers about the order. I explained that I was supposed to have these pizzas ready for an event that I was now going to be late to and requested a discount. The worker didn't seem to have much sympathy and gave me a 10% military discount which saved me less than 4 dollars. I ended up getting the pizzas 20 minutes late and had to postpone the bride's arrival time because we wanted everything set up perfectly when she arrived. I'm most frustrated that nobody owned up to their mistake. We spoke with TWO workers on the phone that day because we called a little later to change the order, so somehow communication was still lost after calling in our order twice. And if scheduled pickups aren't something they typically do then that should have been communicated to us over the phone in the first place. Waiting 20 minutes isn't a huge deal but it definitely messed up our plans and the lousy 10% discount felt almost like an insult. The pizza was good but this was not a good experience.",

The short version of the story is that my grandmother and I waited for almost 30 minutes before someone even brought us water. They weren't busy. I decided to give them a second chance and suggested the place to a group from work with the caveat that I had had horrible service but had a chance to taste the pizza on a separate occasion and it was pretty good. So this time someone called in far in advance with a reservation for 15 people. When I arrived I was the 11th person and they'd already had to add tables/seats and there were no additional seats for the 4 to come after me. Whoever set up the tables apparently couldn't count and the waiters didn't think to get ahead of the situation as we were coming in. At one point a waiter tried to tell my coworker that her and her husband would have to squeeze into each end of a long table. I finally volunteered to move down to that other end so they could sit together on the end I was sitting at. When I got down there I was told by another waiter that I couldn't sit there and that I would need to sit at a separate table behind my party and maybe I should \"ask some others to sit with me so I wouldn't have to sit alone.\" Really? How about y'all set the tables up right to begin with or decline to take reservations? Eventually a couple at a table at one end of our long table offered to move to the patio so they're table could be added to the end of ours. After that we ordered. Food finally came. I should have ordered pizza, the calzone was mediocre. Two times filled with ridiculousness. Never again.",

But, they had many tables open (we were one of 2 couples on the  patio) and chose to sit us by the door in a cold night. It was fine until someone came in and then I froze. It wouldn't have been terrible but this family on the warm doorless side let their kids run around outside and they opened the door every 2 minutes to run in and out.  The food was delicious. My preference is the antipasti platter. It's the only breadless option other than a salad.

Not more because of the following: The food is inconsistent- especially the pizza!  I\u2019ve even called to see if they change crusts and was told it just depends on who the cook is that day.  A few times, we have had great pizza, and others with soggy crusts and way too much cheese. Also, they have a no dogs allowed rule, even on the patio, so often when we walk there, one person in our party goes it to order food to take out, and sometimes the waiter even brings it to us- outside of the patio - rather than have one of us wait in their front area.  It was a great system! Recently, my oldest kid went in to order our to go meals, but a new waitress just kept repeating we couldn\u2019t bring our dog in.  We had no intention of bringing our dog in, which he told her, and the dog and I stayed clear of even the patio.  He tried to say he just wanted to order to go, but she continually interrupted that it was no dogs allowed.  We ended up leaving rather than me having to go in and explain to a new waitress- or just directly to management-that we wanted a pizza to go; it was disappointing.  We really enjoy spending a dog friendly day downtown and then just getting pane vino to go,  but I\u2019m not going to argue with someone to take our business.",
