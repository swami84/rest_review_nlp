I had a gyro platter, and for nine dollars, it was pretty plentiful in the portion size.  I couldn't finish it all!  The decor is standard fare.  It's a carry out venue, so it doesn't take the time to make it look sophisticated.  Now if it were a dine in only venue, I would expect it to be nice looking.  If you're looking for something quick, and if you're in the area, this spot's for you!  They also sell more than Greek.  They do American and Italian as well.",
