I had to call and pull a Karen and speak to the manager which i don't like doing but i have to give credit, they did fix it and even delivered me a new one free of charge. The owner called me and thanked me for letting them know about this mistake (they accidentally left the rice warmer plugged in.) They really do care about their food and their customers. If you're like me a picky about the temperature of your rice paired with raw sushi fish, just ask that they don't serve it with warm, steaming rice. I know this seems like a picky thing but think: when was the last time you were served a warm sushi roll with raw fish? Probably never cause thats a big no-no with raw fish. I chalk it up to an inexperienced worker or just simply a mistake. The rice you get served with chicken is very different than the rice that gets paired with raw sushi grade fish. At the end of the day they made good on their promise and the food was delicious. I'll be coming back again",

However, the prices here were competitive especially if you order chicken, there is an up charge for salmon or poke. They accept Apple Pay which adds a convince factor if you need a meal after working out at Crunch and left your wallet.  On my bowl I added the spicy miso sauce, it was too salty and not hot enough. The chicken was steamed possibly sous vide. I prefer grilled chicken.  Overall this was 4 stars because they are the most reasonably priced option, and there is an added convenience bonus for a post workout meal, but they are not my first choice for a poke bowl.",

        "caption": "The Poke Company Restaurant is located at the ground floor of Kennedy Grand Central Condominiums in the Channelside District of Downtown Tampa next to City Dog Cantina Mexican Restaurant, Gelato-Go Tampa, Massage Envy, Crunch Fitness Gym, Cena Italian Restaurant, Pour House Bar, Ginger Beard coffee, Late Start Brewing, Maloneys Irish Tavern, and the Hideaway Cafe Sushi Restaurant.  Poke Company serves key lime pie ice cream, seaweed salad, krab salad, poke burritos and poke bowls with your choice of protein including ahi tuna, salmon, spicy tuna, steamed shrimp, chicken, and tofu.  Base options include white rice, brown rice, mixed greens, and cauliflower rice.  Mix-Ins include cucumber, sweet onion, jalape\u00f1o, edamame, cilantro, & hijiki seaweed.  Toppings include scallion, sesame seeds, wasabi peas, crispy onions, pickled ginger, tempura flakes, pineapple, eel sauce, spicy mayo, Thai coconut cream, wasabi aioli, masago fish roe, seaweed salad, and avocado.  Sauces include Company sauce, citrus ponzu, sesame Shoyu, spicy mayo, spicy miso, avocado lime, and coconut aminos.  I got the small ahi tuna bowl with a bunch of mix-Ins and toppings and it was pretty good although not my favorite. I was underwhelmed by the small number of mix-Ins and vegetable add-on options available which is much less than other poke restaurants like Poke Express and U Poke Spot by the USF area. If you're in the area definitely try their large bowl but I wouldn't go out of your way to visit if you're in the USF or North Tampa areas. However, for those that live in Downtown Tampa, I'm sure this will be a popular go to spot for a convenient healthy meal!  The Poke Company Restaurant features a very basic casual decor with 8 light bamboo wood tables, uncomfortable steel aqua colored chairs, concrete floors, white walls, industrial basic drop down lights that make the place bright as day at night, and no music. I'd encourage management to color the walls, add some cushions to their chairs to make the place more comfortable, add music, and dim the lights to make the place more festive. To drink, Poke Company does not offer any alcohol but does have iced tea with boba and natural fountain sodas. I look forward to trying more types of bowls soon!",
