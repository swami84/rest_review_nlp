When I called back to complain about my order the man that initially took my order refused to change my order or return my  money. I had to leave my job & walk over to Hamilton deli to dispute my order & ask for my money back. The male worker I spoke to yelled at me & threw a pile of receipts at me then he grabbed my iced coffee & acted as if he was going to throw the coffee at me. I wish I could give them no stars. I WILL NEVER WASTE MY MONEY IN THEIR ESTBLISHMENT AGAIN. Not to mention my coworkers warned about ordering from Hamilton since they've seen roaches in the past & have  gotten food poisoning as well.

The first cashier, yelled burrito bowl and I said yes that's me, she placed it down on the counter and left it there for the 2nd cashier to come and get it and bag it up for me. The 2nd cashier finally comes and says to me YOU NEED TO PAY 75cents MORE!! I said why? She said we charge for the bowl, I said but I told you when I initially ordered that I had a burrito bowl, why not charge me all at once? She screamed at me and cut me off\" WE CHARGE FOR THE BOWL\", I said that's fine, but why not charge at once, why two separate transactions, what if I didn't have 75 cent cash on me, then what? Would I not get my food? She pretty much dismissed me! I have noticed these cashiers are so nasty and rude. If they don't want to serve customers, then leave, there are tons of people out there looking for jobs. No one owes you anything, you work in customer service so its part of your job to satisfy and please customers! ps. Who charges for a bowl, that is the most tackiest thing I have ever heard!!!!",

But it happens all the time.  If you order from them over the internet call them and confirm that they understand the order.  I had to cancel my order for a full refund because they said it would take another hour to get the delivery person to come back to me again by that time I will be leaving my job.  Now I have to find another place to get my food from thats not going to be screwed up.",

Maybe they need to hire another weekend person...?",
