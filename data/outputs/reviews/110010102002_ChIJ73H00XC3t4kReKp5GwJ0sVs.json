I really like the staff, they are always friendly and responsive to your needs. The atmosphere is also nice, it makes you feel like you are hanging out at a local bistro in Italy. The pricing of the food isn\u2019t bad, though, when it comes to their pasta dishes, I do feel they charge a lot for the small amount of pasta they give you. But I feel like that is a common trend in DC for some reason. The personal pizzas seem expensive at first but they are pretty large and I usually get two meals out of them so that makes them far more reasonably priced, in my opinion. They also have a decent wine selection, if that\u2019s your thing (I personally prefer whiskey).  My only complaint is that I wish they had more vegetarian options. They are usually really nice about making their existing options vegetarian, but I would really like some more true vegetarian dishes from them. I\u2019m sure they would be just as delicious as everything else they make. But overall, I love this place and have never had a bad experience. It\u2019s my go-to spot.",

Let me start with the service, everyone is so friendly and ready to assist. we arrived around 6pm, the patio was full. We didn't have a reservation, but the nice Lady at the window manage to accommodate us within 15min. We were promptly greeted by our sever ( a very lovely gentleman, forgot his name) and offered tap, still or sparkling water, and walked us through the menu and specials. The menu is amazing, I wish we had more people in our party ( it was only 3of us) so we could've  tried everything. We started of with the grilled octopus app and a pizza sanara Brigada. The octopus was cooked to perfection, and the pizza was simply out of this world. The crust-cooked to perfection, the flavor was amazing. They had a squid ink pasta with fresh jumbo lump crab meat in light creamy sauce as special that evening... We decided to try it and OMG, what a delight. We also had a Cacio e Pepe and Paccheri pasta. Pasta was cooked just",

Although the brick oven has a propane tank, and not wood-fired, the pizza is cooked all the way through and bursting with flavor. As a proponent of wood-fired, I couldn't tell the difference! Of all the Neopolitan pizza places in DC, Lupo Marino is my top pick over Menomale, Stellina, 2 Amy's, Via Sophia, and il Canale.  The scrumptious housemade rosemary focaccia bread is fluffy and warm right out of the oven! It's so moist with olive oil, that you don't need any on the side.  Marinated Olives (5/5) - My hubby really enjoyed the olives, looks like they were hand-picked as there were very few bad ones.  Warm me up Cocktail (4/5) - The warm boozy bourbon apple cider cocktail packed a bunch and delivers on its name. Fun way to stay warm!  Melanze Ripiene (5/5) - The crispy layers of Eggplant Parm is bursting with flavor, highly recommend the app!  Santa Brigida Pizza (5/5) - Nice spin on the classic Margherita pizza with cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, and topped with arugula. The sweet red sauce and pillowy crust seal the deal! My hubby ordered a side of prosciutto that he delightfully added to his slices.  Funghi Pizza (4/5) - Tasty white pizza with cooked cremini and shiitake mushrooms, lemon preserve, and garlic confit. While the mushrooms are flavorful, I prefer the classic Santa Brigida Pizza.  Chocolate Tortino (5/5) - The petite lava cake was delicious and bursting with rich ganache. Perfect ending to a great meal!  Cannoli (5/5) - The made to order cannoli has a nice light creamy filling with orange zest topped with dark chocolate chips stuffed in a crunchy shell. The house-made cream is fresh, 3 come in a serving.  Panna Cotta (4/5) - My hubby enjoyed the creamy pudding, I wish there were more fresh fruits and toppings. The fruits were under ripe.  Cappuccino (5/5) - They are soooo good that my hubby got 2 rounds and I got my own after trying a sip of his!  It gets packed around dinnertime and starts to clear out around 8:30pm. Recommend making reservations or plan on sitting at the bar - which is what we did! It was fun watching the pizzas come out of the oven and the staff preparing meals in the open kitchen. The bartender, Jason, was chatty and glad that he took our order one dish at time as we were stuffed from the pizza and canceled some of the other dishes. Next time!  Would definitely come back to explore the rest of the menu!",

The most welcoming memorable experience I've had in a very very long time...from sitting right at the bar in the heart of smelling all those outstanding Italian dishes being masterfully prepared!!!  A stream of memories flooded my mind of being in my Grandmother's kitchen every Sunday. It was so kind of you to share Polenta with meatballs....the sauce was outstanding!!!  But for me when you brought out the Limoncello and I first tasted it..again the momories....then the Tiramisu ...I was done!!  We look forward to returning again and again! Fans for Life  2/8/2020",

Pizza dough is not quite baked, so the dough was ready to eat, but a bit tough. But it is a matter of taste, how one would rather have his pizza. At the weekend, especially in the evening, you should book in advance.  (Original) Nettes Restaurant in italienischem Stil. Angebot weitestgehend aus der mediterranen K\u00fcche. Personal war zum Teil nett und zum andern Teil etwas reserviert. Preise sind ok. Pizzateig wirde nicht ganz durchgebacken, deshalb der Teig verzehrfertig, aber etwas z\u00e4h war.

I was baffled by the way the hostesses talked to me. Food is good (I\u2019ve been before and been good both times). Service was okay, but nothing great.

You do get a carafe of water.  I was surprised that the bruschetta did not come with a tomato option. The other options were new if you want to try something different. Pizza are a good size. A bit bigger than a frisbee. Some would say 16\".  Real flowers at the table, a good date night spot, open air atmosphere.",

We were crunched for time, hungry, and on foot, so needless to say our options were limited. I am happy to report that we were greeted with a friendly smile, quick service, and delicious food. I ordered this wildly refreshing kale salad, and may or may not have eaten half of the pizza that my friend ordered. Both items filled a gap I was missing in my life. A gap that only a Tuscan kale, lemon anchovy salad, and Italian style, pepperoni pizza could satisfy. We could not have planned our time there any better. We came, we ate, we left within 20 minutes. It was pretty epic and everything we could have hoped for!",

I came in this past weekend with a large party.  LM focuses on Italian food. It\u2019s a fairly small restaurant, but they are now able to do outdoor seating since Pearl Street is now closed for deliveries.  We tried a variety of items from the menu including: the Fungi Pizza, Porchetta, San Daniel Pizza, Rucula Salad, Meatballs, Fritto Misto, Salami & Formaggi board, Cacio e Pepe, Spaghetti Verde, Tiramisu, Sicilian Cannoli and Bombolone & Nutella. We were all incredibly impressed with the food and service. Our waitress brought our food out to us quickly and correctly and she was extremely personable.  The restaurant itself is well maintained and taken care of. The only thing I didn\u2019t like about The Wharf is the parking. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s hard to find a parking spot and the garage is a maze to get in and out of.",

We were able to be seated right away, which was great for a Friday night. Seating was pretty tight though, and I was back-to-back with another guest. Also, VERY loud. I felt like I was yelling over the music and other guests.  The menu was your typical Italian restaurant. There was nothing that stood out creatively. They recommended the special for the night: a $30 lasagna (which I ordered). It tasted GOOD, but it was not the best lasagna I'd ever had (also, the portion was pretty small for a $30 lasagna)...  Overall, I spent $120 (tip included) on dinner for two for a casual dinner. It was good, but nothing I would come back for. I guess it's affordable for The Wharf, but certainly did not feel like a $120 meal/experience.",

The pasta is also fresh and the pizza delicious. We finished with dessert and coffee and could not have enjoyed our evening out on the city more. The ambiance was also great for the date feel.
