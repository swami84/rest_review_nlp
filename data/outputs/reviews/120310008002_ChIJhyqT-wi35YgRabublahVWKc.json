Mussels and Crab cake apps were very good, but the shrimp with pasta main was bland... the tomato cream sauce had zero flavor. Adding to the problem, the server never asked me if I wanted pepper or grated cheese (both which was needed) and there was no salt or pepper on the table due to Covid. Ordered a piece of cake for dessert... a small sliver, although very good, was $12.  I spent a lot of money for an unmemorable meal and felt as though I was gouged. I probably would not return.",

We were treated so poorly from start to finish, and the restaurant was not even close to full capacity. Even with a reservation (that was booked 3 weeks out), we waited 30 minutes to get a table. It seemed fine at first, but after waiting close to an hour for our appetizer, I realized that our waitress just did not care about our dining experience, nor did the management who delivered our long awaited crab cakes. Our waitress hardly came to check on us, and there were multiple times when both my water glass and drink glasses were empty and I had to try to get her attention. When our food finally came, you could tell that our entrees had been under the warmer for quite some time, as the plates were hot and the food was very dry. The best part was, after waiting so long for our food, I had to ask for silverware because in that hour and a half\u2019s time of us waiting, no one had the foresight to think that maybe we wouldn\u2019t want to eat our $35 a plate meal with our hands! We were offered no apologies from the waitress, nor did the management try to remedy our experience. They were clearly aware of the situation, as we caught them talking and looking straight at us, but no one cared to acknowledge our ruined Valentine\u2019s experience. I would not recommend this place for any type of celebration. Clearly, they can\u2019t handle it.",

The escargot is to die for. I'm impressed with their social distancing and covid protocols, more so than any other indoor restaurant I've been to. The tables are appropriately distanced (there are tables not in use in between each group). They also clean the tables and chairs with a special spray/ UV light device in between every group, I've never seen this before. All employees were appropriately masked. And finally the service is so on point. We felt extremely well taken care of by all the wait staff, and the manager even came to check in on us once or twice. Definitely our favorite place to eat in San Marco, probably in all of Jacksonville!!",

Nice wine list, very relaxing atmosphere.  Ordered the escargot.  Overall the best i have ever had.  The online claims were correct.  Then i ordered the Mushroom Parmesan Rigatoni with truffle oil.  I asked the waiter specifically if he knew if it was real truffle oil or the fake stuff.   He replied \"oh its the real stuff and it is worked into the sauce.  My date ordered Seared Scallops and asparagus risotto with a wine reduction.  My meal was a heavy cream parmesan sauce with some mushrooms, regular brown button mushrooms.  The sauce was so heavy with cream that you could only taste a little parmesan.  Definitely NO TRUFFLE OIL. (can't fault the waiter because that maybe what he was told).  If their was a \"truffle oil\" used then it was the very cheap stuff that loses its flavor quickly.  If it was a basic \"Mushroom Parmesan Cream Sauce Rigatoni\" then I would have been less critical.  My dates meal:  the Scallops were seared to perfection; great job on that.  The risotto was empty of flavor and the Asparagus was mushy and tasteless as well.  As for the \"Wine Reduction\" ; it was a balsamic glaze not a wine reduction.  It might have been a store bought brand.  I say that because it lacked the delicate sweet bite of a true balsamic reduction.  If you want a nice wine list and some AMAZING escargot then by all means go.  As for the rest....not impressed at all.   Especially for the prices...$24 for mine (no truffle oil); $35 for my date (lack luster flavor).",

I had the fish of the day - halibut - and it was perfectly seared and tender and moist inside. The calamari was out of this world, and the salad fresh and crisp. Arrived for an early (6pm) dinner; a party of four. Our server was great and patient as our fourth arrived about thirty minutes late. We had a couple of great apps, calamari and the bleu cheese chips. I had the burger and it was great! The other three had the burger, a pizza, and the short ribs; all said there food was tasty. Would I come here again, absolutely. Hignly recommend!",

I ordered the steak and fries from the lunch menu and the steak was not well balanced in regards to the flavor and not edible. However, the escargot and desert was delicious.  The key lime tart and very flavorful and perfect to say the least. The pastry chef was very kind and picked a dessert that went perfectly with my meal. The server and bartender named Gabriel was knowledgeable and professional and a pleasure to speak with while I was there. To be quite frank, Gabriel and the pastry chef were the only reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars. As an attorney, I know quality and the main course meals did not meet the standard for fine dining but the dessert and service from the daytime pastry chef and Gabriel far exceeded my expectations.",

This was equal parts credit to our server, Ricky, who was charming and attentive and paced our meal to perfection, and Chef, who customized our entrees and really made them sing. We started with the calamari, which was outstanding, followed by house specialty cocktails (a lovely Old Fashioned and frankly terrific Cooper Union - please try this drink), then the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: petit filet mignon au poivre, done Pittsburgh rare with sauce chasseur and haricots verts and probably the most indulgent patates au gratin I've ever had. I couldn't be more pleased with my experience and will certainly return.",

It could have used some toasted nuts or seeds or SOMETHING else to 'beef it up' a bit, protein additions aside. The flavor was pleasant though not outstanding as the Candy Apple Cafe's food was before it closed. For the price point, I was hoping for more.",

The presentation was good but to eat, it was extremely bland and bitter. It's served with tri-colored fingerlings, squash, leeks and mushrooms all in which were flavorless and stiff and did not compliment the braised chicken well. The chicken wasn't dry but I found the red wine to be too overpowering with no balance of seasoning/salt. As a result this left a very bad after taste. I was shocked because I never had chicken that tasted this bad. I absolutely couldn't finish this dish. I didn't complain about it I just left. I'm sorry but if you cant cook chicken right that's a red flag to me so I didn't bother to try anything else on the menu. I just took my dessert and went home. I had the Chocolate ganache cake which on the other hand was pretty good. Unfortunately, due to my experience with my dinner this is the last time I'll ever dine here. Not worth the money in my opinion.",

The bread at the end was still amazing, but I wasn't in such a rush to get there. Drinks are great too.

Our waiter, Will, was very nice and personable. We started with the bleu cheese chips, which came out room temp and slightly soggy. For our entrees, I ordered the Anson Mills Farro, described as farro, fava beans, mushrooms and tri colored cauliflower in a mushroom jus. My boyfriend ordered the roasted chicken, which was the same as my dish and topped with a roasted chicken breast. The food came out looking and smelling delightful. However, that was as good as it got. My farro was undeniably undercooked. It was almost crunchy still. My boyfriends farro was also terribly undercooked. Our jaws hurt trying to chew through the farro. To top it off, his chicken was overcooked. He described it as dry and flavorless. He tried to soak it in the jus a little for some flavor, but the jus was so light that it wasn't enough. In the end I paid $55 before the tip for one of the most underwhelming dining experiences of my life. I'm  pretty upset that I paid so much for so little enjoyment.",

My only reason for leaving off one star is how high some of their prices are, given the city it's located in. Jacksonville is not Miami, or even Orlando. We do have very wealthy people here that don't mind those prices, but they are a very small group of people. If the restaurant lowered their prices a little, they would still attract the same high class clientele, but also people that maybe don't have as much money, as they do class, and good taste. Like me. I'm a good example of that. Which is why when I sell things in person or online, I try to price them in a range that will agree with the majority of my customers. I carry a wide range of prices on things from cheap, to    higher priced. It's just an idea for the owners to think about. Also offering discounts on items, or a free dinner on your birthday to frequent customers on an email list, or something like that, also draws in more business, and shows customer appreciation, which is rare. It would be a good marketing tool, to draw in more new customers.",

Ordered smoked tomato soup which was very \"sour\" and the skin could have been removed before crushing/blending, and mussels dish which was a little too salty. I had to ask for a plain toast because the toast which came with it was heavily buttered, burnt, and way too salty. The waiter didn't check on us, how we liked our food, if we needed anything, and stuff. My husband's fish sandwich which was highly recommended by the waiter was nothing special. We are definitely not coming back.",
