Mussels and Crab cake apps were very good, but the shrimp with pasta main was bland... the tomato cream sauce had zero flavor. Adding to the problem, the server never asked me if I wanted pepper or grated cheese (both which was needed) and there was no salt or pepper on the table due to Covid. Ordered a piece of cake for dessert... a small sliver, although very good, was $12.  I spent a lot of money for an unmemorable meal and felt as though I was gouged. I probably would not return.",

We were treated so poorly from start to finish, and the restaurant was not even close to full capacity. Even with a reservation (that was booked 3 weeks out), we waited 30 minutes to get a table. It seemed fine at first, but after waiting close to an hour for our appetizer, I realized that our waitress just did not care about our dining experience, nor did the management who delivered our long awaited crab cakes. Our waitress hardly came to check on us, and there were multiple times when both my water glass and drink glasses were empty and I had to try to get her attention. When our food finally came, you could tell that our entrees had been under the warmer for quite some time, as the plates were hot and the food was very dry. The best part was, after waiting so long for our food, I had to ask for silverware because in that hour and a half\u2019s time of us waiting, no one had the foresight to think that maybe we wouldn\u2019t want to eat our $35 a plate meal with our hands! We were offered no apologies from the waitress, nor did the management try to remedy our experience. They were clearly aware of the situation, as we caught them talking and looking straight at us, but no one cared to acknowledge our ruined Valentine\u2019s experience. I would not recommend this place for any type of celebration. Clearly, they can\u2019t handle it.",

The escargot is to die for. I'm impressed with their social distancing and covid protocols, more so than any other indoor restaurant I've been to. The tables are appropriately distanced (there are tables not in use in between each group). They also clean the tables and chairs with a special spray/ UV light device in between every group, I've never seen this before. All employees were appropriately masked. And finally the service is so on point. We felt extremely well taken care of by all the wait staff, and the manager even came to check in on us once or twice. Definitely our favorite place to eat in San Marco, probably in all of Jacksonville!!",

Nice wine list, very relaxing atmosphere.  Ordered the escargot.  Overall the best i have ever had.  The online claims were correct.  Then i ordered the Mushroom Parmesan Rigatoni with truffle oil.  I asked the waiter specifically if he knew if it was real truffle oil or the fake stuff.   He replied \"oh its the real stuff and it is worked into the sauce.  My date ordered Seared Scallops and asparagus risotto with a wine reduction.  My meal was a heavy cream parmesan sauce with some mushrooms, regular brown button mushrooms.  The sauce was so heavy with cream that you could only taste a little parmesan.  Definitely NO TRUFFLE OIL. (can't fault the waiter because that maybe what he was told).  If their was a \"truffle oil\" used then it was the very cheap stuff that loses its flavor quickly.  If it was a basic \"Mushroom Parmesan Cream Sauce Rigatoni\" then I would have been less critical.  My dates meal:  the Scallops were seared to perfection; great job on that.  The risotto was empty of flavor and the Asparagus was mushy and tasteless as well.  As for the \"Wine Reduction\" ; it was a balsamic glaze not a wine reduction.  It might have been a store bought brand.  I say that because it lacked the delicate sweet bite of a true balsamic reduction.  If you want a nice wine list and some AMAZING escargot then by all means go.  As for the rest....not impressed at all.   Especially for the prices...$24 for mine (no truffle oil); $35 for my date (lack luster flavor).",
