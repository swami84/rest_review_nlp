Though, the restaurant serves food of different southern Italian regions, like the typical Neapolitan wood-fired pizza, and the eggplant parmigiana. Even though not really just Sicilian, the food is superb!! The service is good as well, and the owner is involved in caring after every table, making sure every guest had the best experience. Plus, the wine list is very special, they serve some Italian wines that are very rare to find on USA! Only downside, eggplant parmesan a little too oily, and carpaccio heavy on the lemon. Overall, great experience!",

There were 5 of them on the day we visited.  It is a very small restaurant maybe 12 tables total with over half of the tables showing as reserved on the friday night we visited. The wait staff was on their phones when not helping customers out in the open bar area. Some may find this distracting but the wait staff was prompt to bring dishes, refills and catered to all of our reasonable requests quickly. The place could get a bit loud on a night where the tables are all filled i feel like.  The location is out of the way for thos familiar with downtown roswell. However eating here provides the benefit of not paying to park or not having ample parking. There are some spots directly in fromnt of the restaurant or a large lot accross a not so busy street. There is also a beer bar and whiskey bar for after dinner libations within walking distance.  All in all for the price this restaurant far exceeded our expectations and we will be frequenting this restaurant in the future.",

Tucked away in a shopping center off the main strip, this delightful little restaurant is filled with charm and lots of homemade delights. We had the specials that night which was eggplant parmesan lasagna and a delicious seafood pasta. Everything was very tasty especially the lasagna although the serving size was a bit small considering the price (very expensive btw!). The service is delightful and all the employees are very friendly. I highly recommend that you reserve though because the seating is very limited and if you don't have a reservation then you may feel a bit like a second class citizen. Also the beer list was outdated and they did not have any of the imports listed. All said I highly recommend this location if you have a hankering for something that'll make you say, mama mia!",

This time bread being cut by someone using a cloth to hold. Only negative was wildly over priced Mediteranian salad at $12 for what would normally be considered a side salad.  Firtst visit:First the good. Very good food and portions making ZuZZu a good value. Nice touches like perfectly baked fresh bread, excellent San Marzano tomato sauce, and house made mozzarella cheese. Chicken parm was excellent and huge. My one and only negative is hygiene. Staff who are bussing tables, handling money, and stroking their beards should not be cutting and plating fresh bread with bear hands. Bread should be held with one side of a clean towel and picked up with tongs. That said, we'll be back :)",

I can tell now that they have changed owners it is not what it once was. The place is missing the charisma it had. The food was ok but not great as I tasted it before. There was way too much sauce and it was too salty; it overpowered the flavor completely of the meatballs and mussels in each of the plates we had. Also way to much Parmesan cheese, which I never asked for it, but it already came incredibly loaded with it. If someone would ask me to go back again I will probably pass on it. There are more competitive options around the area.",
