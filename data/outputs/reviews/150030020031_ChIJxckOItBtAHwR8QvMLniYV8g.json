The food..... was a NO thank you. I ordered the garlic shrimp. It comes with the shell on and with rice. The rice was from earlier in the day... dry and starting to get that texture old rice gets. The shrimp was salty and did not have a garlic flavor. We also ordered the 4.99 maitai\u2019s, and nothing special there, but for 4.99 can\u2019t expect much more than that. I\u2019m always looking for local small businesses because I run one myself. I know how important it is to support local small business. I was sad that the bad reviews were on point. Hopefully they can figure out how to provide good food without sacrificing their business.

We queued up over an hour before close to grab a table. It was looking reasonably promising, but kind Abby suggested we have drinks by the pool while waiting for our table. With images of pool parties and bikinis in our minds, we were escorted to the adjacent dive motel pool which was what you mind find in a 1960s apartment building, with an empty beer can floating in it. It had a dimly lit, electric Blade Runner feel. There was no view to mention, save peering over the perimeter wall to catch a glimpse of PAIA Fish Market where we probably should've eaten instead. Resolving that, worst case, we'd get free (assuming a high-speed exfiltration) drinks out of this, we waited it out. Abby delivered, and not much later a table opened up too.  Everything is fried. Most is palatable. Nothing is good. We ordered appetizers only and regretted nearly all of it. The coconut shrimp was the standout item for not making me question life decisions.  My friend Gautam remarked that he was sad to learn that there was no magic with chicken wings - they get fried, and sauced after. We received dry fried wings with sauce on the side. I was sad to learn that the sauce comes from your typical squeeze jar. All in all it was a night of reckoning with inner demons. And outer demons. And a steep bill of fried food and Mai Tais.",

I thought it was my son's shoe stepping on my foot but when I looked down it was actually a rat. Needless to say I screamed so loud everyone in the restaurant looked at me and the person I was talking to on the phone was even concerned.  When the waitress came she said something like first time but offered nothing further. Well I certainly was not satisfied with that so I insisted on speaking to the owner. He was somewhat apologetic but I pretty much had to insist on a refund, which I received. Unfortunately, I certainly won't be dining there again.",

The $5 Mai Tai's are worth it, you can ask them to go a lil heavy and see if you get lucky. The coconut and pineapple drinks are made fresh in front of you.  It's really no frills but a fun stop for a few cheap cocktails. The bar is a live edge tree slat that looks like lava flow.  They serve food, that you can order to-go (looks good but I didn't eat).  It's attached to a hotel lobby so people are constantly in and out. Over all the customers I talked with were friendly and happy to chat. Good vibe and drinks for a walk in. Come in with a Aloha Attitude, check it out, and give it a try.",

Firend in the group got the Hawaiian burger and said he'd give a 4.5 star for his meal.  Another friend said she would give a 5 star for the service. We we're really well cared for and she checked on us frequently! Our receipt said her name was rachel. I didn't hear her when she told us .
