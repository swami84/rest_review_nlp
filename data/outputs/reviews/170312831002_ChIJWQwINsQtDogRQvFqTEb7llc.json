Dosa to Mirchi Bajji all the way to their meat dishes are cooked and served to perfection. I didn't try their vegetarian yet, but am sure they would be no less than the others i tasted. The Lassi is a great way to cool off from the yummy delights they serve.  The management team is among the best among many other restaurants. When an online system made a mistake, they worked with me to find other ways to make it up to me.  I wish they expand to serving weekly meal packages for those interested in reducing cooking time at home.",

This is the first time I ate here for the first time and will definitely be coming back again! This has become one of my favorite places and top Indian restaurants in the city or suburbs where I live. I\u2019ll come to the city to eat here. So the vegetable springs rolls were piping hot and perfectly crispy with really delicious sweet and spicy sauce but I also ordered some sriracha to make even more spicy and the filling inside was delicious. The paneer dosa and masala dosa were stuffed perfectly and the sambar and chutneys especially the chutneys were delicious. Then had paneer tikka and that was one of the best I can remember if not the best. Highly recommend ordering that. Ordered channa masala with garlic naan and that was good but not I prefer more spicy. I\u2019d give all the other dishes 5/5 but this one and the channa masala more like 4/5 but that\u2019s because I like real spicy but my Mom said it was perfectly made. I look forward to coming back and having more Indo Chinese dishes (fusion Indian).",

They don't even put on mask in the kitchen when I go to pick up the food I have seen the people in the kitchen have their masks down not even covering their face.  Food Quality -  the quality of this place dropped immensely and most of the curries are average. The tandoor items are horrible and biryani is average  Spice - spice level is quite fine tbh as long as u tell them to adjust it  Delivery - whenever I have ordered from here I always get the delivery after 1 hour even though I stay nearby, even during pick up order I have ended up waiting for order way beyond the estimated time they told me  Service - whenever I dined here pre covid there was always delay in service sometimes we had to wait for hours for food to arrive on our table and I don't even blame the waiters because most of the time it was understaffed and only one person used to run around the entire restraunt. Also one of the waiters himself told me they don't even let them take the tips which made me feel really bad  There are way better places than this, where u will get good quality indian food and honestly most of the 5 star reviews on here aren't not even authentic",

I have tried various dishes including chicken biryani which was extremely bland, chicken fried rice, chicken schezwan noodles which was loaded with pepper and was nothing like Indo-Chinese food. When Siri opened up I was happy to find so many great Indian options but after being repeatedly disappointed, I have started looking elsewhere. I hope the management goes back to their earlier recipes until then I wouldn't recommend Siri :(",

So I decided to use them for catering for a socially distanced group lunch at work that we organized outdoors. I had the entire team choose their orders in advanced and placed the order the morning of the event. Unfortunately, the restaurant had a flooring emergency in the kitchen the night before and the kitchen was unexpectedly closed for repair work. I totally panicked: here I was a couple of hours prior to my event with no food... I talked to the owner and explained the situation. He was amazingly accommodating and understanding. In spite of him dealing with an emergency for his business, he decided to honor the order due to my circumstances and open up the kitchen just for that. He went the extra mile, prepared yummylicious food and even delivered it himself although I was more than willing to pick it up. He even went out of his way to make and extra stop in order to provide plastic ware and plates prior to the delivery. But here is the most unusual part: because of his own emergency, the owner was not even ready to accept payments. So he dropped off a ton of food with me and simply told me that I should contact him for the payment the next day, once the restaurant officially reopened. I wish there were more businesses like this out there, that cared so much about their customers and had such a level of trust!!! Needless to say that my work event was a success and everybody LOVED the food!!! Thank you so much Siri Restaurant, you are the best!!!",

The other two seemed like they were from the day before.  Update 09/19 - I was contacted the very next day after my review last week and the manager apologized for what had happened. He requested that I give them another chance which I did today and was happy to have my taste buds satisfied this time. I am really impressed with the owners customer obsession and have decided to them 5 stars. Keep up the good work!",

Except for chicken curry, rest of the order hyd chicken biryani, hyd chicken 65 wasnt upto mark. ~85$ worth order which was wasted. Highly dissapointed.

Although I have only had the buffet here One time only, I am very surprised at the quality and authenticity of this place. Plus I have only had their vegetarian selection.  With those caveats out of the way; I am willing to bet that I will be going only to this place and Egg-o-holic from now on. Both of the North Indian and South Indian items tasted wonderful. The sambar, rasam, Mango Dal, curd rice along with the northern style Paneer makhani, mushroom Curry, biryani, naan, Mango kulfi were all delectable.  I have a feeling the meat items are also done well. For a restaurant in the UIC area, I was not expecting this selections and quality. Bravo.  Edited to add: I have been here multiple times since. The weekend buffet has a small selection, but everything is tasty and pretty authentically cooked. Especially the biryani. The dinner menu has a good South Indian selection along with the usual mughlai/Panjabi stuff. I really think this is the best Indian place in the city. You have to get to the burbs to get this quality. They also do a all you can eat Dosa night on Tuesday and a Chaat night on Thursday. Both are worth it. As you can tell, I am really excited to have this kind of place close to go regularly. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d",

I picked up the order, not knowing two plates and plastic ware were requested as I received this through the app, then I deliver the order to a OBGYN at Cook County Stroger Hospital. The doctor went into the hospital after having been given her delivery, she turned around and came back out and asked where the plates and plastic ware were. I told her that I did not know about this oh, and I asked her if she needed me to go get her some plastic ware. She said no, then a security guard told her that she could go into another room right on the main floor and get plates and plastic ware. I called the restaurant immediately after this and told them that the customer, who is the doctor, stated that they put specific notes in the order about plates and plastic ware. It is upon information and belief vet in Pryor postings of reviews for this restaurant there are a few different customers mentioning the lack of plates and plastic ware. This leads me to believe that these owners really don't care whether or not you get plates or plastic ware. Therefore, if you are ordering from this place and, you require plates and plastic ware, you better let him know up front, you better put it in bold Capitals in any online ordering mechanism, and it might be a good idea to follow up with a little phone call so these people truly understand what you mean when you put those notes in the applications. I gave them a 5-star review because I don't believe in shooting at people like that I am just going to give them this constructive criticism perhaps they will stop trying to save pennies.",

We ordered the chilli chicken, paneer chilli and babycorn for appetizer - all of it delicious. Then for entree we ordered special chicken biryani( is which highly recommend), dum biryani(we thought of ordering two different kinds for trying out the variety of food they have but we were not so found of dum biryani. It was dry and not much masala it chicken pieces as the special) then we ordered the chicken tikka masala gravy with naan ( it was yummy in my tummy) and also had the paneer tikka masala.( Note I guess all the entree gravies come with plain steamed rice). We had the ras malai for dessert which summed up our lunch beautifully.",

Dosa- very very average and sambar was thick and not hot. Chicken tikka was good. Gobhi Manchurian was decent too. But the service wasn\u2019t good at all. Wait time wasn\u2019t long but we had to ask for napkins and spoons. They advertised free dessert for mothers on Mother\u2019s Day but didn\u2019t offer it. My husband asked for it and after some hesitation they got is gulab jamuns...which tasted fine but no spoons. Had to ask for it. The staff doesn\u2019t greet or smile. Maybe understaffed. They all looked too busy and tired.  UPDATE- I am changing my rating from 2 stars to 4. My son went again today with his friend to eat dosa and he really liked the food. He said the sambar was soupy and hot today unlike what We got last time. Thanks for your quick response to my last review. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

But the catch is, it's served from 6:30 am to 10:00 am but if you show up at that time, they don't open the restaurant and you show up early morning to eat nothing but lies. So, Siri has this policy to not open restaurant for breakfast becuase it's not profitable to them. Welp, and they won't pick up the phone too, it straight goes to voicemail. :)",
