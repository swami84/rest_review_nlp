The menu has quality items and dishes are Fresh every time.  The restaurant is impeccably clean, fresh d\u00e9cor, and wonderful staff.  The Bruscetta is so fresh and tasty, pastas are homemade daily and the best chicken parm in NW DC.  You could go to a chain, but why would you?  This family establishment is dedicated to quality and always delivers.  I have even had this restaurant cater a party, and the food was loved by all.  Highly recommend you stop in and enjoy a wonderful meal in DuPont!",
