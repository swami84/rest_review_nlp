I call again, no answer.  I call AGAIN from my girlfriend's phone, and they pick up *immediately*. They were ignoring phone calls from my own phone number. I called her out on it but of course she denied it.  The food just arrived now, an hour and 49 minutes after the original order was placed. We ordered two items, and live about 5 blocks away.  Clearly there was a mistake with the online ordering service (I ordered through their website) and that's totally understandable, but this was just handled terribly by them.

I was near the Verazzano Bridge, yet it listed this one, about 15-20 minutes away. After I found out I had placed my order at the wrong location, I get there and the girl says I have no order, so now I am FUMING even more. I'm starving, the app screwed me up, and now there is \"no order\". After she asks her coworker, my order magically appears....okay...... my order was a combo, so it was supposed to have a drink. Just to clarify, one would think that a \"pick-up\" order is meant to just \"pick it up\", right? Well, I got the bag with my order, and I realize there is no drink..... so now I'm in the store for a second time FUMING even MORE (at this point I've decided not to ever use a mother effing app to order food, just do it the old fashion way), and I ask the girl, where is my drink ...... she sort of pointed out to grab it.... I've worked at fast-food locations, and this is the first location where I have to grab my drink, I have no problem doing that, but if it's a \"pickup\" order, why not have it ready for the customer? I mean, maybe theres some type of explanation for this, but being that I was starving and FUMING, this didnt help..... The burger was okay, dry, nothing special, DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $12 I spent on a combo; the fries seemed uncooked (it was more of smushy potatoe fries)... all in all, definitely not ordering thru an app, and never bothering with this location, since the other locations I've been to havent been THIS bad.",

        "caption": "I am actually writing in regards to the fuel in park slope which I just visited for the first time today and will definitely never visit again.  I actually love fuel in general.  I work near the one in sheepshead bay which is located at 1715 Sheepshead Bay Road in Brooklyn and would eat there every day if it wasn't a little high in price.  Anyways, back to my review.....so I visited the fuel in park slope today and ordered the citrus sunrise smoothie and drove off.  I had to return immediately to return it because of my displeasure.  It tasted very tart and watered down by the apple juice.  Definitely the worst one I've ever had.  I brought it back in to exchange it for hopefully a much better tasting smoothie and the mexican gentleman who was working there seemed almost reluctant to make us another one at first and he didn't see how we could have not been happy with the smoothie he made us.  So I had him make me a banana latte which is one of my favorite ones that I order from fuel all the time and it was just a nightmare.  It was so over powered with cinnamon that I couldn't bare the taste.  I had to bring it home and put it back into a blender with 2 table spoons of peanut butter to offset the taste.  I didn't want to go back into the store for another exchange because it was clear this man did not know how to make good smoothies.  So lesson learned and I will never visit this store again.",

One thing I wish is that they'd get a computerized system for orders, so I didn't have to give my address every time I call (which is often).
