We sat outdoors with everyone else in this Covid world we now live in. We ordered the lobster dumplings. They were okay. We next got the mapo tofu. The sauce was way too much and the flavors were a mixture of everything but the kitchen sink. This description seemed to be the theme of the night there as their next dish, me gorang was just an overpowering mix of every herb you could think of. The biang biang noodles were over sauced and over flavored too. The best dish of the night was the dessert.

For dinner we had the lo main and Ramen bowl. All were delicious. We are looking forward to going back!",

There are old menus from Asian restaurants framed and up on the wall and made me feel like they were trying to be more \"Asian\" with the menus. Service is fast and the servers are kind.  We ordered off the happy hour menu. We ordered the Zambino which had a cinnamon flavor. It's good, but I was not a big fan because it had the burn of alcohol at the end of the drink. We ordered the bao and the order only came with one bao. It was pan-fried and extremely greasy and salty. The flavor came from the shredded pickled vegetables inside the bun and the pork had no flavor. The wings were decent, but nothing special. The fried gyoza was covered in red chili oil and that is what it tasted like. The fry bread with uni butter was light. I did not taste any hint of uni in the uni butter, so I was disappointed. The honey soft serve is really good and had just the right amount of sweetness, but the chocolate shell tasted cheap. I think it would be better without the chocolate. The chocolate peppermint is good and had a decent amount of brownie bits at the bottom, but there was nothing special about it.  Overall, 4 stars for the honey soft serve and service and 3 stars for the rest of the happy hour menu. The food is okay, but nothing jumps out except for the soft serve.",

I could have had a couple of bowls of the Smoked Lamb Khao Soi, as well as the honey soft serve ice cream with a chocolate shell and caramelized honey (check out the pictures). I would drive back to Portland just to have those two dishes. When you are in Portland, this is an absolute must.",

If your looking for seating you can converse in with more than one other person, that is going to be difficult. The main portions of seating are bar style, or these very tiny two person tables.  If you get the right food it can be tasty, but most of it is done in the typical 'fancy' resturants small plates style which I almost never find to be worth it bar a couple exceptions.  The food i had often felt close but not quite right to the original sources, and I would have prefered to just go somewhere that served them closer to the original styles.  I found the kimchi to be too vinegar in flavor, and didnt feel like the gochujang flavor didnt show through. Its hard to go wrong with what is essentially savory fried dough, but i feel it was too expensive. The miso ramen was decent. Im not sure how you can make a miso broth not salty enough though. Its hard to mess up ramen in miso with veg and a pork belly. But to be honest, I would not come here again, nor would i reccomend it to anyone. The staff was lovely but the food just isnt worth it.",

The miso ramen was tiny, and bland. The BiangBiang Noodle smelled really great, but was quite overcooked and was overall uninspired.  Overall, the three dishes came out to about $64 dollars and we felt like we just ate three appetizers rather than main dishes. I think in the future, larger portion sizes and focus on amping up the flavor would bring us back to the Honey Paw.",

The lamb was great. lots of meat in super rich flavorful broth. it comes with fermented daikon radish though and that was a bit much. Lamb can be quite rich and gamey which i like but paired with that funky daikon it was just too much. I actually wish there had been more noodles and broth and less of everything else. Next was the fried chicken which we were told takes a bit longer which is normal and completely understandable. The chicken comes out cuts up in pieces with a huge skillet of cornbread. The breast meat was fine very crispy with good flavor but the leg and thigh however were under cooked and still pink in middle. Couldn't eat. The cornbread was weird. it was very greasy with a giant ball of butter or coconut oil or something in the middle. It was also quite dense and again was just too much with the chicken.  i know how popular and well loved this place is so maybe we just had an off night.",

Firstly, while I'm sure there is sometimes a wait, my bf and I didn't have to put our names on a list for a 1 hour+ wait to dine here. The decor was trendy but still inspired by elements of Maine. We ordered the MATSUTAKE DONBURI and SMOKED LAMB KHAO SOI (excuse the caps, copied from their menu). The mushroom dish was both hot and cold and was one of the most elegant dishes I've ever had. My fave was the pate like mousse on the tamago and the little tempura crisps in their rice seasoning. The curry noodle dish was also delicious! At first, it came out lukewarm but the kitchen quickly remade a fresh bowl for me. I love their use of the mustard greens and the broth wasn't too salty (as many \"ramens\" are or too heavy). The noodles were also perfectly cooked. As a small apology for the mistake with my dish, they brought out a sample of their banana ice cream. Holy cow it was SO good and fresh, served with chocolate and pie crust. My favorite overall dining experience in Portland because the environment was welcoming, each dish had something special, and my mouth is literally watering as I write this review now. I would make the 2 hour drive any weekend to eat here again.",

Our waitress was amazing and knowledgeable, the food runner was just as impressive and helpful  and the  drinks were phenomenal and came quick!

I\u2019ve been back a half dozen times, and the food, service, interior, are all five star worthy.  So I\u2019m now begging you honeypaw PLEASE, change your seating plan or incorporate sound absorption into your decoration. Sitting in the restaurant is a little like sitting in a wood chipper. It is SO LOUD inside.  Extremely tall ceilings, cement floor, and seating that doesn\u2019t allow you to interact with anyone more than the person directly next to you makes the dining experience unfortunately uncomfortable. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to update my review when I go back with noise-canceling headphones, but until then the assault on my ears unfortunately outweighs the delight of my tastebuds.",
