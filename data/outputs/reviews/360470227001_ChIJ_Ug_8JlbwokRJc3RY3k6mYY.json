I work in the area and I literally hate coming here when the women are working. They have the nastiest attitudes and don\u2019t even want to answer questions about the products. They don\u2019t say Hi, even when you walk in saying hello.  When I first started working in this area about a year ago I went there everyday for about 2 weeks and was not receiving my purchase stars. I showed them the proof in my banking app and was waved off by the same woman with the piercing under her bottom lip that always gives bad customer service. For every negative customer experience, I will be posting a new review. Something needs to change and I\u2019m tired of the poor service and high prices.  The two Hispanic females in the front STILL need to be replaced. Nasty attitudes and will ignore customers repeatedly. I waited until the blonde one came off the phone so she could take my order, then as she starts to take my order she takes another call and completely ignores me. Even went to the back for some time when she could have simply taken my order. She came back to the front as is literally ignoring me to search for an email. I had to ask 3 times if she could just take my order. They know they take forever to make orders, they don\u2019t take orders over the phone, and if you order on the app you can\u2019t earn loyalty stars. Now I\u2019m back and the same phone that she was so eager to pick up, she is completely ignoring. This place\u2019s main focus is to give poor customer service. I just wish someone would open a place that offers vegan and plant-based options. I would never go here for my lunch break again.",

The burger was so tasty and healthy (could've used a bit more meat, tomato sauce, and cashew nut \"cheese\") but was flavored like no other! Had this sweet smoky flavor.  The falafel could've fooled me! Would've loved a bit more of those little balls for the sad as well. I will most definitely be ordering from here again and thank this place for spurring me to start making my own at home \"no bean or soy\" falafel and vegan burgers at home. The delivery took a reasonable amount of time.  A suggestion would be to add some fresh hummus and pita bread or warm thick chip to the menu. And some sort of \"fries\" like sweet potato or something. These could be used as \"sides\" to the meals as they are a bit pricy for single items...  Highly recommended for vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists, and humans in general! :) 4/5",
