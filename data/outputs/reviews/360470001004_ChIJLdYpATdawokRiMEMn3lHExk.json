Due to the pandemic we were seated outdoors, which was very pleasant as we weren't on the street as most locales now are. It gave Henry's a bistro-like feel that was really welcomed. The tables, with the black chalk paint and the foam underneath to cushion knees was a nice touch. A simple artesanal bread selection to start with was well received. The clan chowder was flavorful and my spouse thoroughly enjoyed its flavors. We had an incredible experience with their pistachio crusted goat cheese salad that made our eyes roll back from the flavor explosion. The elk, prepared at the chef's suggestion was TO DIE FOR. Perfectly caramelized and tender, the hints of rosemary and no taste of gaminess, whatsoever. The staff is on point with the wine pairings and made the experience all the better. Come and enjoy \ud83d\ude09",

He was not bothered by my response. I proceeded to ask is this a reservation only restaurant.

The first time I experienced Henry\u2019s End was sometime in the 1990\u2019s and the intimate atmosphere, warm personal service and exceptionally delicious food left a lasting impression on me.. During the many years that I lived in Brooklyn, I brought countless friends here to share the experience.. It became my go-to restaurant, always serving up wonderful food and offering a perfectly curated selection of fine wine and beer.. Far from over-priced, the value of the food and experience here will almost certainly always surpass the cost of the meal.. In the restaurant business, like most businesses, there\u2019s so much to be said for consistency.. Well, 20 YEARS LATER, on a trip to NYC I recently brought my wife and children to Henry\u2019s End for dinner.. We were greeted with the very same warmth and charm by the same faces that I remembered.. And they even remembered me after not having been there for over a decade!! The bread and butter given to us as we waited was the same as it always was and every bit as delicious as I had remembered.. Everything that we ordered that evening was cooked to absolute perfection and presented beautifully.. I could go on forever about what a treasure this restaurant is and still never do it justice.. If you\u2019re anywhere in the NYC area looking for an amazing meal, please do yourself the favor of visiting Henry\u2019s End, tucked away in the sweetest part of Brooklyn Heights, just over the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.. I promise you will not be disappointed.. And to Mark, the staff, and the family of this fantastic establishment, keep up the good work.. You are truly a blessing!!",

        "caption": "My fiancee and I make a habit of eating at Henry's End for our birthdays. The restaurant sends out gift certificates good for 1 week before and 1 week after your birthday. It is a really nice gesture for repeat customers and since we aren't wealthy people, it allows us to enjoy a finer dining experience.  The wait staff is always fantastic and knowledgeable when it comes to dietary needs. My fiancee has celiac disease and the menu is clearly marked to alert your eyes to what is gluten free. That menu is also extensive and the waiters know it fluently.  In terms of entrees, I recommend the steak au poivre and the veal scallopine with brussel sprouts and pancetta. My fiancee would recommend the blackened lamb with spinach and garlic. Also, the West Indian BBQ shrimp are to die for as an appetizer.  This place is marvelous, so check it out!",

While Henry\u2019s isn\u2019t much to look at \u2014 the small room is lined with exterior-style wood paneling and packed with no-frills seating and tables \u2014 the service, the food, and the wine are sublime!  I was tempted by the Wild Game menu (featuring emu, elk, kangaroo, and more) but had arrived in the mood for seafood. I started with the bacon and corn chowder, which, while not much to look at, resting un-garnished in a shallow bowl, was absolutely delicious. It was seasoned beautifully and the slight sweetness of the corn and the rich smokiness of the bacon played perfectly together. Next I enjoyed the king salmon and mustard. It was cooked perfectly, a beautiful maillard sear on the exterior and a delicate medium rare in the center. The house blend of mustards added a delightful tang to the fish without masking its own flavor.  The service was friendly and attentive, and clearly the staff were all veterans that knew their restaurant in and out.  Perhaps the real gem was the wine list, with unexpected depth, including 1966 Haut Brion and other deep cuts from highly prestigious old world houses. I fished my meal with a 1958 Malvasia Madeira that exceeded anything a traditional dessert could have offered.  I\u2019ll definitely be back!",

We had a slight wait for a table (15 to 20 mins) but we were seated while we waited and we were well looked after by staff. The waiting period is the only reason for the 4 stars. The food arrived promptly and was very tasty. I would personally recommend the lamb sirloin steak with mashed potatoes! The restaurant has a well stocked bar and I would say it's reasonably priced (relative to NYC). Definitely worth a visit, but perhaps call in advance to book a table.",

Megan, the so called \"manager\" of this establishment may be the rudest most angry hospitality person I have ever experienced.  We are from Florida. We found Henrys End on the internet. I called the restaurant at 650 PM to make a reservation and Megan answered. She told me that there were no tables available until 815 or 830. I thought that was too late so I thanked Megan and said we would find something else.  I don't know Henry's.  Didn't know how large it was nor even where it was.  Many times, the restaurant receptionist is not aware of what tables may or may not be available particularly in large restaurants.  We often use Open Table to check availability.  After I put down the phone with Megan, my wife was on Open Table and she saw a reservation at Henrys for 8 PM so we booked.  When we arrived, I indicated that we had a reservation for a table at 8PM. There were THREE empty tables at the time we arrived. Megan walked over to me, my 85 year old Mother in Law and wife and said' \"You thought you could speak in huh?\" Megan then proceeded to show us!! How dare we use Open Table to book a reservation when she told us over the telephone that there were no tables available until 815. Megan was going to show us!! She made us sit at the table just by the front door that no one uses to wait. And, we waited, and waited. Two other groups came in and were seated before us. I managed to keep my cool very well while Megan doled out her punishment upon me, my wife and MIL for using Open Table and going \"around her.\"  At one point, I asked Megan f we could see menus while we waited. She looked at me with a scowl and announced, I will be back with you shortly sir. She came back 5 minutes later with the menus and an even worse attitude at which point, my wife said, \"let's get out of here.\" By this point it was 8:30 and we still hadn't been seated!! We left and went next door to the Italian restaurant, Noodle Pudding which could not have been more friendly and wonderful. We were very fortunate that Megan was so rude. Otherwise, we would not have found Noodle pudding.  Megan suggested that I complain to the owner Mark. Mark, consider this a complaint! You may want to find a new manager/server who isn't so angry.",
