I've traveled all over New York city searching for the best patty and tried all the highest rated establishments. Some big, some small. The bronx, brookyln, and queens. This place has the best. Really is one stop for the best patty in New York city and even better than several places I held as my top spots in Florida for this tasty jamaican meat pie. I grew up eating patties as both my parents are jamaican (they even made and sold them out of our house when I was younger). I will say that sometimes its a hit or miss in terms of getting that truly exceptional patty but it is always satisfying. Today I just had to give them all the credit as they put out one of the best tasting patties I've had in my life. Flaky, buttery, perfect meat to pastry ratio, and abundantly flavorful. Perfection. I hope they can keep this up and improve their level of consistency because this place would blow all others out of the water.",

The spinach one was really delicious, has a good strong spinach taste. No seating or bathroom here. Im not sure if they take cards, I paid in cash. It's super tiny but felt good to support a local business. The woman was very kind and seemed really grateful to have customers. They had a variety of packaged cookies and sodas/drinks. I'm not familiar with Jamaican culture, all I know are beef patties lol buy j did not feel weird coming in here. The patties themselves seemed like a texture of that they are baked instead of fried. I was hoping they would have the flaky annatto colored patty crust but these were more pale in color. They were good, but not $3.50 each good. The Coco bread was meh, It sure what I was expecting. But if I was ever in the mood again I would come back simply because they treat you really nice here.",
