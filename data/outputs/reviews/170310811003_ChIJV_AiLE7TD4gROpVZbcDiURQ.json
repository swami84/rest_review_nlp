The food is always good but the service is always a hit or miss. This last time we ordered in from here made me never want to order or dine with Somerset again. We placed an order over the phone and via email with Nicole, the beverage director, for a pick-up meal on Christmas eve. We confirmed with her multiple times that our order would be ready with all the additional items we had requested and were looking forward to a nice meal with our family on a very important night. I get there to pick up the order and we were told our order was never placed, never noted, and we had to wait another hour while a new meal was prepared. The new order was not the original one we had requested and we were charged and missing a few items. I not only missed a huge chunk of time with my family on Christmas Eve, but the food was also  not what we ordered and not good. We solely ordered from here because we wanted the gingerbread tart and we didn't even end up getting it - and over paid. I tried multiple times to call and speak with the manager about the mishap, but my calls were never returned. I've never had this type of experience at any Boka restaurant and will never be going back. Save your money for a place that will provide better food and service at any of their other restaurants.",

Also they do not offer any complementary bread, so we decided to ordered a flat bread and again very disappointed, it was not a flat bread but a horrible fried sliced of bread. Moreover, the burger we ordered was raw and fries not the best and finally customer service very poor as well. Our recommendation, stay away, it is a pretty place with low food quality.",

Was interested to hear that a neon Hotel sign used to hang outside when the building was a less than desirable hotel. Though the food was good I did have a MAJOR issue with the service/waitstaff. Enjoying oysters (with three still left on the shared plate), without asking me, a waitress took away my plate! It kinda left me dumbfounded; oysters aren't cheap, there were three left and without a question my plate was taken away.  I am still baffled that a waitress would do such a thing! Ultimately 3 oysters weren't enjoyed  ... appetizers still on the table and bang ... my plate was taken away just because it was momentarily empty. This nonsense forces me to give Somerset a low raiting - which is tragic because the food was delicious and the atmosphere great.",

And there is only one reason why they did not make a 4.... price for what you get (That said, this is probably the perfect restaurant for a visit during Chicago's restaurant week!). Somerset is north State St.; it occupies the first and second floors of the Viceroy Hotel which also hosts Devereaux on the rooftop. Staff was very attentive, our waiter was knowledgeable about the foods and specials.  Very personable and professional all at the same time! Fantastic seasonal seating outside along State St for people watching and if you get a corner seat, even that can be intimate.  Indoor seating is vast with booths and the bar on the first floor and table seating on the second.  Just a beautifully decorated restaurant and you can tell they paid attention to detail. The food is presented well.  They have an extensive cocktail menu ranging from beer, mixed drinks, specialty drinks, wine and then the $$$ wine.  If you know your wines, they have a eclectic wine list here that you should raise a glass to. Our apps were delish... Oysters and roasted octopus for a cold/hot variation.  Followed buy the main courses of the short ribs and a salmon they had on special.  We sided the entrees with the crispy potatoes and mushrooms as well.  Mind you, each side can feed two so choose accordingly. All said and done, Somerset, I really enjoyed our visit.  You appear to be a staple in this area although surrounded by many other restaurants.  Thank You!  Enjoy Somerset if you have never been, but, expect to pay just a little bit extra.",

My husband got the corn beef skillet and he said it was delicious. This place also looks super cute and the service is great! Overall a fantastic brunch spot.

The food at Somerset is described as \u201cApproachable American Cuisine\u201d (which I agree with), and they have a nice range of options for brunch.  What I Ate:  Bellini - passionfruit and champagne - YES. Cinnamon Roll - we split this deliciousness between three people and it was the perfect amount!

We tried many things but the favorite dishes of our table were definitely the beef tartare as an appetizer, and the dumplings as an entree. You have to get one order of those on your table at least, it is something different from any pasta (or dumplings) you\u2019ve ever tried.  Service was lovely too, and they have an extended wine list, amongst which really amazing red wines.",

I think a poached egg would have been much better than a sunny side egg when it comes to avocado toast. And who puts carrots...?? The avocado is quite flavorless and needs some salt.  Apple Juice ($5)- 3/5 I love fresh squeezed anything, so of course I had to get the apple juice. This does taste more like water downed cider, but it was still decent. Not the best I've had though.",

When I asked why, they said it was because that I hadn't had the best experience last time and they wanted to make up for it.  What I loved about it, wasn't the free drinks per se (though very much appreciated!), it was that they obviously cared enough to be checking their reviews and then proactively wanted to improve the experience for their guests.  I had no idea that they had read my review, recorded it and even knew that I was there yesterday (I gave them me name when I came in for the table, they weren't GPS tracking me haha!).  I truly was impressed and appreciative of them caring enough to try to improve my experience versus before, which they did!  It's nice but feel it's over rated.  Service was a bit insincere.",

It seams to accent different flavors when paired with their crackers or peta style bread. The octopus was an equally pleasant dish. My wife had the Ricotta Dumpling with a pea puree. She was very much impressed with the flavorful light and airy bites.  Entrees My daughter had the Grilled King Salmon which was cooked to perfection. Flavorful and very moist with a wonderful sauce to augment the flavors. I had the Roasted Beef Short Ribs. They were substantive, tender and delectable with well balanced flavors and sauce. My wife had the seared scallops which were perfectly cooked, moist and buttery with a outstanding seared crust.  Deserts We had three, Rhubarb Pavlova, Butterscotch Pudding and a Dark Chocolate Mousse. All were marvelous. If I had to pick one over the others, it would be difficult but would say the Butterscotch noised out the other outstanding deserts.  Service We had a gentleman who spoke clearly, with proper diction and was at a steady cadence for us to follow along without missing details when one speaks to quickly. He added to the enjoyment of the dinner and helped round out the overall experience, well done.  If we lived in Chicago we would be regulars. This is a place to have a great meal. In all, portion size, atmosphere, service was all worth the price to value.  We are Very Happy Campers  P.S. I was informed Somerset is attempting to gain a Michelin Star. I believe with this food they will acquire a star in short order.",
