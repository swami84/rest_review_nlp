I tried ordering my custom salad and it wouldn\u2019t let me add that with another bowl. So I ordered it thinking I\u2019ll place a separate order for my second bowl. Unfortunately, Sweetgreen wouldn\u2019t let me place a second order while the first was still in progress and I couldn\u2019t cancel it and I could modify. So honestly, my experience with the delivery app was nothing short of frustrating. They offered to give me $10 but that doesn\u2019t solve the fact that there are two of us who need food and they only gave me an option of ordering one bowl.",

My order was taken by a line server named Bato and he was full of energy and extremely kind he made suggestions to my plate as substitutions and the bowl was AMAZING! I will be returning often since I work in the neighborhood and he\u2019s probably the main reason why. Thank you Bato, for the great experience!",

When it's not smelling like this its smelling like bad cafeteria food. I wish this trend of throwing lettuces and vegies into a food.processor and calling it salad would end.",
