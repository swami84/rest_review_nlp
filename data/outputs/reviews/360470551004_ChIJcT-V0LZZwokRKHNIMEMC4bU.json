The Cheese biscuit, And dunking that biscuit in the bisque was unbelievable. I enjoyed it greatly I was quite upset that I only ordered one. I wish I ordered all they had and frozen all left overs. So I can happily consume the rest later. Because I am a old school rap head. I truly enjoyed the decor. I wish attend this establishment before now.",

I wished this morning that I had gotten another roll, but didn't want to be a glutten.  Tue lobster salad was great and that damn biggie ain't nothing to play with. Always delicious never disappointed. If it wasn't for these greedy kids I would eat there every week.",
