The other thing I really enjoy is that with most tacos, burritos, etc. I have to add things to them to make it good... like sauce, limes, etc. This burrito is perfect exactly as the chef makes it. The food tastes like someone took time to make it and has a homemade-ness about it that has made it a favorite of mine worth telling people about. And the HORCHATA!!! Fresh, creamy, beautiful mouthfeel - not the watery, ice laden, powdered mix that you find at other places. Truly a hidden gem that would not be out of place on any local top 10 list or foodie show.",

It would be one thing if they canceled immediately after I placed the order, knowing they were busy and couldn't get it delivered on time. But notifying me of this after I had already waited close to two hours, and the food was already 30 minutes late, is just really terrible service.  Oh, and by the way, the restaurant didn't close for another two hours after I was notified that my order was canceled, so it's not like it was too late to rectify the issue and deliver the food.  Do your self a favor and don't order from here.",

We called calmly to try to get a partial credit to our credit card and the man didn't want to help. He got an attitude fast and complained to my boyfriend that he should have ordered because he spoke Spanish.  This restaurant might be good if you know Spanish. Otherwise, there is a good chance they will get your order wrong. The woman who took my order couldn't even spell Ashland. She spelled it Ashlane (after I correctly spelled it out to her). That is ridiculous when the street is only three blocks away.  Long story short, instead of giving us the partial credit, he demanded all the food back and voided out the account. I worked at a Mexican restaurant for over 3 years, and someone who spoke English FLUENTLY always answered the phone so this issue wouldn't happen. I would try to order from there again, if they handled the situation better but they didn't. Big disappointment!!! :(",

The salsas are awesome- the verde is deliciously spicy, the rojo hints roasted tomatoes. I think this place has great value for the quality and portions you're getting.

Then I tried the Al Hambre Quesadilla, which is just steak and peppers, and oh my goodness, let me tell you, it was absolutely perfect. Kind of on the greasy side, but not on the sickeningly greasy side of things. Then I tried the sope. I have never had, or heard of, a sope before, but let me tell you it is an absolute treat. It's sort of like a fried corn tortilla, that's puffed up a bit, then topped with your choice of meat and vegetables. It was just so stinkin' good.
