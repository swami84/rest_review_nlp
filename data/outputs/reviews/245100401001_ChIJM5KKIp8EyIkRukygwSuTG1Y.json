Perfect amount of spice (I asked for medium), the flavors were great and the portion was more than fair. The rasta pasta was also incredible and had the right amount of heat for me. Portion was decent as well. I was very impressed and would definitely order again. Honestly, I kind of want to order again right now.",

All of it can be accompanied by a side of good french fries.  Of course, the real star of the show here is the jerk chicken that is not too spicy but definitely tasty.  It stands above all of the other greasy menu options which also includes fried food.  The service is a little slower than other food court options but the wait is worth it.",

Maybe I should have gotten the jerk fish and rice opposed to their Gumbo. I Love Gumbo and my family prides themselves on making Gumbo for family gatherings. The rue, the seafood and okra make it delicious. HOWEVER, this gumbo had a strange almost mud dirt flavor, its an herb or spice that I have never tasted. I bought the chicken sausage one for my Pop, and shrimp for my self.  Very spicy like i like but i couldnt get past that special seasoning flavor. I wasted $20.00 just to learn not to eat the GUMBO. I wonder what herb that is? I want to take a star away for that awful taste but dont want to effect the ratings for the rest of the menu.",
