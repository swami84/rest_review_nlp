The noodles and toppings were great but again, the the spiciness was too overwhelming. I could taste jalapenos for some reason. The server was not friendly or welcoming at all. No hello, no welcome, no how's the food, etc. I asked if they had any non alcoholic drinks. He said \"we have soda\". I asked if they had smoothies, teas or special drinks. He said \"no\". After he left I looked at the menu and found some Korean and Japanese drinks. I ordered a Milkis, which I enjoyed. Server should've been more helpful as it was not busy aside from about 3 tables. Have been served by this server previously. Not sure if he is part owner or manager, but always had same non enthusiastic attitude.  3 stars because, aside from overwhelmingly spicy soup and not so courteous server, I think the food is good and I would like to try a non spicy option of the ramen.  That I could see, there is no obvious sign outside that says Saburo Ramen Bar. Saburo is part of Kangnam BBQ and basically the same restaurant. Just have a separate seating area.",

The red and black ramen was my first choice but I highly recommend my second choice. But now it's time. Need more default vegan options on the menu, shaving off 1 star.
