Just today I experienced the most satisfying all beef and herbed meatballs with zucchini and carrot noodles, parmesan, with a savory pot-liquor like sauce that melded the flavors together.  This has been one of the many palate surprises over the years. Also valued for many of us has been their sourcing of locally produced, raised, grown ingredients as much as feasible, coupled with that emphasis on growing the local food economy.  Lastly, not inconsequentially, since so many of us have to choose between time to linger over our lunch, and time sensitive commitments, I personally value their decision to serve takeaway orders in renewable, compostable packaging.  Near the coast, in this land of many rivers, what we do has an outsized impact on the health of the gulf's fisheries, and habitat for all the wonderful creatures of the sea that we don't fish for too.  As a familar voice counseled many of us, \"Keep up the Good World.\"",
