        "caption": "I went to this place to kill my yearn for genuine Northwest China taste. A little disappointed. The ingredients and taste were everything reminders of their genuine Chinese counterparts; however, it was not real Xi'an taste. The Hamburger was tasty and pretty; but I like its original Chinese version with specially made plain bread; same with the filling. Based on the standards for American restaurants, I rate it as five, since the ingredients were fresh, healthy and tasty, service was fast and courteous, and the place was well maintained. But based on the standards of Chinese restaurants, which weigh more heavily on the look, aroma and flavor of food, I rate it as 3. So an average of 4.",

You\u2019d have to wait for a bit while this burger is perfectly ready...  crunchy texture pastry, perfectly spiced juicy meat filling.  My choice was lamb but there are pork and beef filling as well.",

        "caption": "Walked by yesterday to try Xi'an Taste but there was such a crowd of people clamoring for this new food stall's Chinese hamburgers and duck that we decided to return later in the day.  Well, we did check back later the same day and one of the working owners who told us they sold out of their food by 2:30pm and had to close for the day.   Wow!  They opened at 10am and the demand was so great that they had to close drew us to return today.  The big draw to Xi'an Taste is the famous street food snacks called \"rou jia mo \u8089\u5939\u998d\" or meat filled folders (sandwiches).  Rou Jia Mo  has earned the reputation as \"Chinese hamburger\" and has its culinary roots from Xi'an's Hui people (Muslim) and Han Chinese.  Xi'an Taste also offers handmade chilled noodles (liangpi \u6dbc\u76ae ), spicy pickles and braised or stewed duck.  Today, we arrived at 10:30am and found a group of 4 women already seated in their small dining area, which comfortably seats 8 to 10 people, and several people standing around the food stall as they had already placed their orders.  The 4 women were served various sandwiches (beef, lamb or pork) and several salads.  There were 2 male workers busily preparing and assembling orders behind the counter but immediately acknowledged our presence by saying they'd take our order as soon as possible and asked for our patience.  We could see they were \"slammed\" by the number of people ahead of us and weren't in a rush anyway...so we waited.  In the meantime, we perused the menu and made our decisions.  We chose the lamb or mutton and pork hamburgers and a dish of cold noodles. The bun or bread was similar to pita but slightly more flaky like the Chinese scallion pancake.  The seasonings of the lamb was a bit on the spicy peppery side but not alarming and I tasted cumin notes.  The pork filling was also tasty with chopped bell peppers, scallions and cilantro.  Each sandwich was packed with its own meat filling.  Both were served hot from the griddle and made for a comforting and filling meal.  Oh, the cold salad (liangpi) was a m\u00e9lange of flavors that hit every category (sweet, tangy, savory, herbal, nutty and more).  The liangpi was made up of rice noodles and tofu in a vinegary-sesame seed dressing.  The worker who served us this cold salad mentioned that the pink colored noodles were made from dragon fruit as we could see the color and tiny black seeds.  This cold noodle salad was refreshing and flavorful with pleasing slurpable mouthfeel.  All the while that we were dining, there was a constant crowd of curious folks.  Most of them who came by ordered takeaway so we couldn't see their expressions.  However, to us, the food flavors, textures and value are enough to bring us back again and again.  NOTE:  Please note that your food will be prepared in front of you and usually takes a few minutes.  If there is a crowd ahead of you, please be PATIENT.",
