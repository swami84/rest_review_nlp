The food was good- I had lychee Ice tea- lots of flavor that I added 2 cups of water and it still had flavor. Next I tried the fried tofu which was not full of oil or crispy crunchy.

Delivery is super quick (often 15-20 minutes after you order) and the food is always piping hot.  It's slightly more expensive than other Thai places in the neighborhood, but very much worth it.  It's never that crowded inside, and offers a quiet place to enjoy a meal.",
