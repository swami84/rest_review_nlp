Beautiful, intricate and refined dishes, and an eclectic cocktail list made for a wonderful dinner experience, that ended with very tasty dessert.  Service was friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend!  Added: pictures from our recent takeout experience, which, while a bit involved, was also really spectacular food-wise!  To add to the review above, since the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019ve tried Sepia at Home twice now and both times we\u2019ve been stunned by how great it was.  This Thanksgiving week, we\u2019ve tried the beautiful moist chicken breast with mustard jus, and the salmon, with multiple sides and everything was spectacular. A consistently great experience!  Edited to add: we also opted for the Sepia Christmas dinner and immensely enjoyed it. The rack of lamb was good, but the roasted root vegetables and the mashed potatoes were the real star! \ud83d\ude0b",

Housed in a 19th century print shop since 2007, restaurateur Emmanuel Nony smartly recruiting Executive Chef Andrew Zimmerman in 2009 and since earning accolades from the French tire guide, JBF and Jean Banchet Awards, diners visiting Sepia in the era of Covid-19 will begin their evening with checked temperatures followed by city-mandates necessitating masks be worn any time staff approach the table with fresh serviceware or even a refill of Water.  Undeniably inconvenient, QR Code menus another anomaly amidst this temporary \u201cnew normal,\u201d it is largely thanks to the room\u2019s grand appearance and gracious service that an air of refinement is retained, though the greatest part of Sepia\u2019s appeal remains attributable to Chef Zimmerman and CDC Kyle Cottle\u2019s Food.  Best classified as \u201cContemporary American,\u201d though oftentimes globally influenced and focused on seasonal Produce, dinner began with an amuse of lemony Cucamelons amidst modernist textures, a breath of freshness quickly gone and followed by the first of two \u201cParker Rolls\u201d that were nothing like the Boston namesake but nonetheless buttery and delicious.  A complimentary duo in terms of influence, Zimmerman\u2019s training at the French Culinary Institute and time at NoMI visible in finessed flavors while Cottle\u2019s tenure with Achatz is evidenced by manipulated textures that act to enhance rather than just \u201cshow off,\u201d Foie Gras Mousse comes curved at $15 supplement, and eaten left-to-right explores Liver\u2019s ability to magnify everything from earthy Sunchoke Chips to dried Shiso and juicy Cherries.  Adding another $16 for a second plate from course two, Corn Agnolotti with Pickled Blueberries and popped Sorghum suspiciously similar to Marc Vetri\u2019s dish at Osteria Fiorella just one week prior, suffice it to say that although good it in no way compared to Chawanmushi that reminisces of Quenelles de Brochet with a velvety mouthfeel and generous amounts of Lobster.  Not about to pass on Duck, the combination of Stonefruits and Midwest Onions acting as a deft foil to complex Sauce, Dessert sees newly-acquired Pastry Chef Lauren Terrill prone to whimsy, her globally-traveled palate presenting aggressively spiced Funnel Cake with Nuts, Berries, Peaches and Citrus.",

Walking in we were greeted by a hostesses who was super nice and took our jackets. Mind you we were dressed plainly and in our early 20's, and were treated very nicely.  The food? Was absolutely spectacular. I loved every portion of my meal. I got a lamb rack and it hit the spot in flavor. Large enough to get full and full of flavor, cooked exactly medium as I requested. They brought a Biryani, that was amazing, needless to say I was shocked they pulled that off.

It was flavorful and multi-dimensional. Will definitely be ordering again.",

The food and menu is of a different order entirely\u2014wide variety, often locally sourced, and presented creatively. The cocktail menu was, creative and the cocktails were delicious. The wine list, had some big names, but also some hidden gems. This was very cool to see. The night that I visited the restaurant was busy, and the team looked to be understaffed. The service was good, but not what I was expecting considering what I have heard about there service. Overall, my experience was great, and I look forward to returning in the future.",

I received confirmation via email and a personal call to verify any food allergies and sensitivities.  Our server was top notch and so was the dining experience. From the tender Japanese A7 Wagyu to the smokey caramel of a 30 year old Port each element complimented and built on the previous.  The atmosphere was full of sound as everyone in the room appeared to be happily conversing and enjoying themselves while the wait staff was buzzing with food and drinks.  Our table received a special taste plate from the chef that seemed unique, similar to miniature macaroons and cream. It was tart and sweet which made for the perfect palate cleanse after the appetizer of savory buttered scallops.  We didn't feel rushed, there was no pressure, and our server was patient as we asked questions and bantered about the menu. The server knew all of the menu items and was not shy about sharing opinions and making recommendations.  Dessert was worthwhile, and I won't regret the extra calories. Throughout, the house special drinks were easy to sip. My taste was for a \"Gentlemen's Thief\" (Rye and cider?) which was not too week, not too strong, was perfectly balanced and felt natural while waiting at the bar for our table as well as complementing the meal.  On a side note, the local Uber Black drivers knew to stay close as we were picked up within a minute or two of stepping outside.. very good for a cold evening with warm friends.",

The wine list, had some big names, but also some hidden gems. This was very cool to see. The night that I visited the restaurant was busy, and the team looked to be understaffed.

We decided to go with their tasting menu ($95) and wine paring ($60). Both were excellent. Wagyu beef is just to die for. Amazing! Scallops were wonderful too. The whole menu is unbelievable! Wines were amazingly paired with all dishes. The interior is classy, simple yet very beaitiful. It is a former print house, so it has that that vibe. It is pricey, (well, it has a Michelin star) but so worth the experience! Thanks for the holiday of taste!",

We didn't receive our appetizers until 8:40, and then waited another 45 minutes before we got out entrees. We spent a total of 2.5 hours there and left hungry. By the time we got our entrees I was starving and couldn't even enjoy the food because I just wanted to scarf it down quickly. When I was asked by the manager about how everything was I mentioned how long the food had taken and the manager did not convey any understanding or apology and neither did our waiter. I did notice that they gave me a complimentary extra pour of wine, but that gesture really meant nothing to me because it lacked acknowledgement of why they were giving that to me. Overall the food was good, but nothing that deserved a Michelin Star and I will not be going back or recommending this place.",

I really enjoyed the reasonably priced tasting menu, I liked how the flavors played together - I would have expected 6 instead of 5 courses (excl. amouse bouches). But who am I to judge? The pappardelle were a highlight to me. The wagyu tri tip more of a marketing thing (it's a pity the chef has to measure against inspectors who expect fancy ingredients over flavor). Why not offer duck, quail, iberico or other powerful flavors instead? Cheaper for the restaurant and better for the tasters - but worse for the pretentious folks who need that Wagyu.",

Appetizer was ok, I would suggest nice country bread with the mousse instead of the fried tiny toasts. It is nice to have that much of mousse, but you should give enough of bread to go with it. I picked the short ribs. My bad I didn't read the details... When the plate arrived, I figured this was actually pasta with some short ribs sauce. I switched plate with my husband who got fish. Our waiter stopped by, didn't noticed the switch... We didn't complained about anything but we should have. Food was good but our waiter was totally careless.",

The size of the foods was small, but the foods only are okay, more like something you could purchase at 40-50$. I think Sepia didn't treat this event seriously. Sepia possibly reduced the quality of foods to deal with the reduced profit.  Also, the service was terrible. We ordered Sparking water, but during the meal, waiter added plain water to our Sparking water!!! The remaining sparking water was screw up, and that's not a mistake a Michelin Restaurant should make. Plus, the manager didn't come to ask us how was the meal. The dinner was not busy at all, so I guessed the manager didn't care a lot about the Chicago Restaurant Dinner",

From the moment we walked into the restaurant (the space was utilized beautifully might I add), it felt business as usual.  When I told the host of the occasion, the response was very flat and frankly not quite welcoming. We were seated and looking forward to a wonderful meal.  Then the evening took an unexpected turn.  I had to send my drink back as it was awful.  (Later I learned that mixology makes the martini alitle differently than what I am used to).  I sent it back and received pretty much the same one back.  Could not drink it.  The server Jason was not friendly at all.  Very mater of fact and not helpful. Felt as if we were taking up his time.  We decided to just order a couple of starters rather than the tasting menu (it looked exquisite).  When the starters where served, I made what I thought was a funny comment about the cheeses all being from the British isles, asked if a jig came with the service.  The response from the server was basically we are not a macaroni grill and u should go there if u want that kind of service.  We were stunned.  Made to feel as if we did not belong.  I was so upset that I did not eat my dish and ask that it be taken to go.  For what was to be a very special dining experience for us two foodies at an Andrew Zimmerman restaurant was utterly disappointing.  The treatment was appalling.  The sad part is that it was very clear we were unhappy but no one asked or took the time to figure out what was wrong.  Felt as if they couldnt wait til we left.  Frankly I could not get out of there fast enough.  Never ever been treated that way in a fine restaurant.  We ended up going to the mag mile for a meal.",

We ordered one of every appetizer, and nearly every entree as well. What stood out:  Appetizers: - Gnocchi was amazing - The soup was absolutely delicious also - Cheese/meat platters were okay  Entrees: - The char was pretty good, although a bit small - The steak was not bad, it's a decent choice if you like steak and aren't too particular - The duck = BEST. Everybody who ordered it thought it was absolutely delicious  Desserts: - The free toffee they provided was probably the best - The pumpkin cake wasn't bad, but wasn't mind blowing with the ice cream either  I thought the service was very top notch. The only thing I didn't like was when I told them to order 1 of every appetizer and they didn't put in the order. Then I asked them if they ordered every appetizer for us, and he said no, and that we shouldn't since the soup is for one person. However, we all wanted a taste of the soup, so we ended up ordering it anyways.  Also, I was the host of the event and ordered all the wine. However, the waiter actually went to another person to ask him what wine he wanted to buy after, which I thought was awkward since I was hosting.  Overall, I think it's a great business venue, or for a date.",

Imagine receiving a serving of tortellini with only 4 shells of pasta in an oversized bowl, no meat.  OR imagine macaroons the size of a marshmallow!  I am a foodie and consider myself to be a connoisseur of fine dining in Chicago, as I was born and raised in this city.  I came to this place for New Years Eve simply because they were offering a \"six- course meal\" dining experience for the evening.  At a whopping price of $125/ person, one would expect to leave full and satisfied.  However, what we received were six TASTE PORTIONS (if you can even consider them that) of entrees from their regular menu.  Although the dishes were served separately, everything we ate could have fit onto one large plate with space to spare.  The overall taste of the food left more to be desired, as there is nothing that I would absolutely have to try again. Needless to say,  I left this place still hungry, dissatisfied, and $300 less wealthy than I walked in.",

Charcuterie was stellar and similar to Richmond Station (Toronto) in quality. The only dish that was off balance (too acidic with overpowering flavors of lemon/cilantro) was the squid appetizer.  Would have preferred if the olive oil cake was softer and less dry.  Minor things but I went in with low expectations because the West loop has been overhyped (Girl & Goat, Au Cheval, Lena Bravia were all big let downs).  Sepia held up to their Michelin star, and in my opinion was equal in deliciousness to band of Bohemia.  Service was great and the atmosphere was very nice (upscale modern).  The tables are really packed closely together which was a little annoying (often would feel staff brushing against you while doing their job), but at least the chairs were big and comfortable.  Costs approx 200 to fill us both up (3 appetizers, 2 mains, side of potatoes, and dessert).  I will be back.",
