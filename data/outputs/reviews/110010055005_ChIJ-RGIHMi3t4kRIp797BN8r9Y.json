Don't know, only went the once and never plan on going back.  My first words upon walking out of this restaurant were \"What an awful restaurant.\"  We waited in line for 15 minutes in front of the host desk without a single member of the staff even looking at us or explaining why we were waiting. When I finally asked a waiter what was going on, he asked the bartender, who brushed him off. No one came to speak to us.  After our wait, the host returned, I asked him why we waited for 15 minutes with no one looking at us, explaining the wait, or even standing at the host desk. He informed us that it was because they were busy. It's worth noting that not more than half the tables were occupied and roughly 15 people stood in line in front of the host.  The studious way in which the staff ignored us is truly remarkable. Half a dining room full of people standing in front of the host desk with nary a glance or rough approximation of acknowledgment in our direction.  The food itself was average and barely worth the price paid. Let me be clear, the food was NOT bad, I just don't think it was great. My home fries were cold in the middle, the eggs Benedict was acceptable.  I spoke with the manager who offered a free mimosa, something I'm not interested in.  At the end of the meal, I paid $55 plus a tip for some granola and vanilla yogurt, 2 poached eggs with hollandaise sauce, and an English muffin with a side of lettuce.  Bad days happen, I get that, but bad service with mediocre food is not something to brag about.",

Our reservation was made for 4 and some of my friends decided to join and it changed to 6, the hostess was very accommodating and so nice about it. She even sat me even though my entire party was not with me. My party ended up being only 5. One of my friends did mention she had an allergy to nuts and ordered the granola parfait and asked for no nuts, the server asked if it was an allergy or just a preference which was very considerate and also mentioned that cross contamination might be a factor. My friend did let him know that she was ok with that. We appreciated the service from hostess to the waiter. Definitely coming back in the future.  Also as irritating as separate checks   can be, our server did not make it seem like it was an issue.",

We sat at the bar which is nice enough and overall the decor is cool in the dining room, but the hostess had to go find the barkeep. He looked like he had been taking a nap or participating in some other activity and did not seem well versed about the glassware or beer on tap. They did comp my Sprite/similar soda although I had ordered club soda. Not the best experience.",

We started with a beer and a cocktail. Good list of cocktail options, limited beer list but good quality local beers across a variety of styles. We picked the scallops appetizer since we intended to share. Didn't realize the scallops were raw! I enjoy that but my wife doesn't. But she ate the golden beets. A little heavy on the poppy seeds, but enjoyable. I had the pot roast and my wife had the duck. Both were very good - we finished to the last bite! The pot roast was fork tender. Nothing unusual, just good comfort food. We ended with the chocolate creme du pot. Tasted just like chocolate pudding but the whipped cream and cocoa nibs were a good addition. The service was excellent throughout the meal, not overbearing, always cheerful. A bit pricey, not sure I would have gone without the voucher.",

The starters were excellent but the main meal was absolutely horribly done.  The drinks were very overpriced and what they tried to give me I've nicknamed a craptini cause it wasn't a martini.  I only gave 2 stars because the starters were just that freaking great.  The decor is also very nice.  They're trying to be something, though I'm not sure I'd consider that something 'good'.  Nothing else about this place stood out and overall I'd say just go somewhere else if you want a good night out that isn't overpriced for no good reason.",

Another couple showed up twenty minutes after us for a birthday and was told happy birthday several times, was brought a birthday cupcake, and had charges removed from their check. We told our waitress we had a time table to adhere to. Not only was that neglected, but the couple next to us, as well as another couple who showed up 40 MINUTES LATER received their food before us and the gentleman next to us ORDERED THE SAME THING AS MY GIRLFRIEND!!! I tried to explain the situation to Christopher, the manager, who was very apologetic and told us our main courses have been covered. It is a good thing he did, because I would never pay for the garbage we received. This is by far the worst dinning experience I have ever had and it wasn't even my birthday. I am eager to hear the response the restaurant has for this neglect of service and courtousy. I advise no one to depend on this restaurant. They will drop the ball. I will never be back, that's for sure.",

The yolks were hard which I consider a sin for Eggs Benedict. They were also very cold as if they had been waiting out for a bit. The hollandaise had almost solidified on top. I was not the exception either. Another member of my table ordered the same dish and had the same problems. For $17 I expected better. Coffee was $5 for mediocre drip coffee, not an espresso drink. We had also called a few days prior to change the size of our reservation to smaller but when we got there the changes had not been logged and they sat us down at a table for 4 more seats than we needed. This isn't a bad thing for us, but it definitely reflects miscommunication in the restaurant. The atmosphere and decor of Firefly is cute and trendy and that definitely helped a lot. Overall I was very disappointed as I have heard so many good things about Firefly before and felt underwhelmed by the food.",

The food was okay, with notable exceptions from the group being the pleasant (and overpriced) truffle fries, the flavorful spicy shrimp grits and the uninspired regretful omelette and greens.  There were few vegetarian options on the menu (Feb 2018, different from what is posted on their site) and none were particularly exciting. While they mentioned more options to come in their next menu, none of the party were very inclined to return.  Besides this, our stay was enjoyable as it was not crowded and service was polite and friendly.  Note for other large parties: they do not split the check, expect 20% gratuity and it may take a while before your food comes, which is all understandable. Finally, it is not a real tree that is featured indoors. More like a \"Keebler\" elves kind of tree.  Hope that helps!",

Literally a wedge of iceberg, a few cherry tomatoes on the side, cardboard hard bacon bits, and a dressing. This I would not serve even to my dog, who lies green stuff. 2. The charcuterie board. A shame for the restaurant! For USD 17 you get something like 6 paper thin slices of below medium quality cured meats that bear no identity, 3. The cheese board. Another shameful dish. For USD 16 you get three (!) SMALL pieces of cheese, one of which is a cheddar, the other is a disnitegrating chevre, and the third looked like brie, but I did not bother to taste. The restaurant manager must take all these three dishes out of the menu immediately.",

We had a small back room reserved that was very quiet. The service was fast and hands on, but the food was just okay. I ordered the pumpkin soup (which was the stand out dish of the lunch) and a reuben that was mediocre.

Service was slow and inattentive. 3 requests for a refill on coffee resulted in...no more coffee for us. Ugh!",

First off, the wait we encountered for our reserved table was not a great way to start off our experience. The menu was all right but definitely not as many gluten-free options or any willingness to accommodate that diet as I was expecting. Our small plates were good, I personally wish I had just ordered two of the fried oyster plates instead of one and getting the crab cakes. I was really disappointed with my crab cakes and I can say it wasn't cheap being that disappointed. My girlfriend liked her pot roast. Honestly, you can probably find the same food here done better somewhere else for less.",
