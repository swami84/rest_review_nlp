Steak hoagies with pizza sauce on one bun and mushroom sauce on the other , and i always tell them to make it sloppy. My favorite. And when i want a cheese only pizza , this is the best.! . Don't get me wrong, i love a super supreme pizza, but at Angilos, i prefer cheese with extra cheese!  They don't deliver to where i live , so its a treat when i happen to go get one. Raised my son on same and its his favorite too. I think they must use pure provolone, which to me makes the difference. I could be wrong, but when i make a pizza at home and use plain provolone , that's the closest I've been able to get to try and make it  taste like Angilos. Yummy! Sometimes ill make it cheese and mushroom, and their mushrooms always good. Side order of fried  mushrooms is  automatic, cause those are really good too. The place in Covington has nice down to earth people and I've actually stayed and ate there once.  Layed back people and perfect pizza!  Never had bad food there, and not once have i been given wrong order or ever been disappointed. Cant say same for some of the bigger chains. Another thing. If you do want a pizza and want massive toppings, they don't limit amount of toppings like some other pizza places do. I actually quit going to one of the bigger chain places because they refuse to put more than 5 toppings on a pizza and only 3 in a calzone. To me ,if a customer wants 20 toppings they should get it , but just be told   that it may be slightly mushy crust or whatever.  Should be up to customer s long as they willing to pay for the toppings. Anyway, if you were raised on Angilos and need your fix. The one in Covington has always been good!",

I\u2019m not what you\u2019d call a \u201cpizza snob\u201d by any means and have been amazed at the quality of other mom and pop restaurants. Basically, it\u2019s hard to screw pizza up.  We ordered the chicken bacon ranch speciality pizza and one pepperoni, and to say we were disappointed would be an understatement. Both pizzas simply were not very good, kind of bland, and just...ehh. Best way to describe it would be to compare it to a slightly upgraded cafeteria pizza. In addition, the prices are way, way too high considering the quality of pizza. If you\u2019re going to charge $20 for a large specialty pizza, it needs to be really good.  It\u2019s a shame, because the workers were all incredibly friendly, and, from a business perspective, I thought they hit the ball out of the park in terms of customer service and just being nice people. I truly value this as a consumer and often vote with my wallet because of it. I\u2019m all for giving second chances and will try them again to see if our experience was an anomaly, but in that case I\u2019ll stick with buying a small before shelling out nearly $40 (with tip) for two incredibly average pizzas.  Service: 5/5 Stars Pizza: 1/5 Stars (keep in mind, I take no glee in this rating. I\u2019m not one of those people who complains about minor issues)",

When I got there to pick it up, there was my pizza, along with a smaller version of the pizza with white sauce. Will definitely order here many more times for sure.  Also, the white sauce was great with chicken and bacon. Should've gotten that as the large instead of the red sauce. Lol.",
