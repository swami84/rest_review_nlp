It is likely the same guy, since I have experienced the same horrid service from this buffoon. It is a swamp of nasty vibe there, if the staff have no pride in what they do, imagine the lack of care they will put in your food (a good example, is how one guest found bone in their chicken sandwich!). The huge contrast in some guests receiving five star services while others are one star to none are beyond me. Either they are picking the type of guests they are willing to serve and the type they are ignoring or the few 5 stars reviews are simply bogus and are from family and friends of store. Either way, save yourself the guess work, spend your money elsewhere.",
