When I asked for the 6 pac of buns  the sells person brought them over, when i asked if they were fresh or how long were they sitting out she could not give me a straight answer. I asked how long would it take to order fresh buns she told me \u201c a long time, hours\u201d \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude33. I asked, it will take \u201chours\u201d for fresh buns?\u201d She said, yes!  again i asked well can you please tell me how long were the buns you brought me were sitting out, she kept wanting me to purchase the already pre packed buns. Then asked how much $10. change for old buns fresh buns were $18.  When i asked why she said they are fresh so i asked when where the other buns baked she said early that morning about 11am . I asked why was the price difference i was told bc that was the rule.. i asked for the manager to explain, manager was called and i explained everything that happened. The manager said that\u2019s the rule \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude33 i explained to the manager that i have brought buns at the  same locations a few months ago and asked for fresh buns and paid the same price, it didn\u2019t make since. However, i left without the buns and annoyed that the manager wasn\u2019t even trying to help and was willing to lose the sell.   BTW, the sells lady could not  understand my English speaking question i was asking her, another reason i asked for the manager. I will never  patronize this location again.",

I remember the days where me and mom would go on a shopping spree at PG Plaza and would top off our day w/ a delectable doughy treat. Everything is served in a timely manner and the costumer service never fails to surprise me. The options are beyond imaginable and will have you craving more in due time but all in all, Cinnabon is a great chain and supply's me with sweet nostalgic memories. I recommend without any hiccups.",
