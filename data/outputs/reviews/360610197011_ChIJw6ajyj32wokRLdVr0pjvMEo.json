Only complaint: the sign outside says you get a free lemonade with pressed sandwich or salad. When I asked about it, here's what the person working said, \"12pm.\"  Me: \"What? What about 12pm?\"  Them: \"It's free from 12-1.\"  Didn't seem worth arguing that the sign just says, \"Lunch Time,\" and they should put that on the sign. And just answering \"12pm\" is equally ambiguous. Still, irksome and it's sidewalk clickbait.",

Well I get the chai and it's a blended frozen drink, I asked the guy and he said 'that IS iced' but yet the person in back of me orders an iced coffee and their coffee comes as an iced drink. Coffee with ice. I was so confused but I wasn't going to argue. It was 20 degrees that day and there was just no way I was going to drink a frozen chai. I took a few sips and threw it out.

I love their crepes and flatbreads. I have one main complaint though, which is that they often leave the door open and the entire glass wall open. Given that they are on Amsterdam avenue, ehcuy has heavy traffic, and they are near a hospital and right next to a bus stop, it's very noisy and very unpleasant. If I wanted to sit outside and inhale all the fumes and the noise, I would. We should be able to enjoy a coffee in peace inside the restaurant without all the traffic, bus and ambulance noise.",

Beware if they tell you that they can ship the same day! We placed our order Monday morning, and after hearing nothing from them for three days, we called on Friday only to hear that it was not dropped off to be shipped until Thursday afternoon. They attempted to place the blame on us and the postal service even though one of their staff members told us the package was returned to them because they messed up on writing the address (a business who advertises to all parts of the US should know how to write an address to somewhere out of state). Further, they fail to communicate with us, and we have had to contact them each time. The worst is the fact that their supervisor is missing right before Christmas, so our $200+ is in limbo with us being told that \"they'll be in touch soon.\"  We have ordered from here before, but after this terrible service, we will never order from Artopolis Espresso again. My family friends have also ordered the same amount of pastries from other Greek bakeries in the NYC area and have already received them. The fact that I ordered mine on December 14th and was told that they would come in by December 22nd at latest and still have no clue where our order is located is unacceptable. They haven't even given us a way to track the package because \"the supervisor will call and give it to us.\" Too bad the supervisor is out. I would give zero stars if I could. One star is giving too much credit.",
