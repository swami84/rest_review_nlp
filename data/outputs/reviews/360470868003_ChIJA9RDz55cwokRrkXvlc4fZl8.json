Earlier today, around 1:30pm, I went to get a veggie dhalpuri roti, and I was the second in line. Another lady comes into the store behind me, and the lady taking the orders completely passes over me standing in line to ask the lady behind me her order, before asking my order with an extremely patronizing \"and what would you like, young man?\"  Annoyed, yet remaining polite, I gave my order, and I wanted for the food to be prepared. The cashier decides to yell out \"I need help out here, cause it seems like this young man has to go back to work or is going to work or something.\" I was extremely disrespected and embarrassed at this point, but I still waited quietly for my order.  The order came up to $7.62, and I gave the lady $10.65 (two $5 bills and 0.65 in coins.) I only got three cents back, which I put in the coin jar, but noticed I never got my $3 in change back.  When I pointed this out, politely, the lady countered with \"You didn't give me two fives. You gave me exact money.\" I offer a rebuttal, as I know how much I gave her, and she refused to give me my change. I called her out in front of the other patrons, stating that I, nor my family will be bringing our patronage back to Tasty Carribbean if you are going to be robbing people of their money. She feigned offense at my statement, and gave me back my change, with this retort: \"Alright, alright, no love lost, but you gotta get your marbles checked.\"  She called me crazy in front of the other patrons. I was appalled at the sheer disrespect that this clerk showed me. I called her out for her actions again, and I stated I will not be spending my money here again as I took my food and left.  They need to understand how customer service works. The woman's behavior was appalling, and the owner needs to discipline her for her actions.  Go to Ali's on Fulton and Nostrand instead. They actually treat their customers with respect and dignity.",

This is Trini food from back home, they are doing some serious and big things over in that kitchen. At this point I've gotten enough family, friends, co-workers etc. to try and they weren't disappointed. It's always clean and always a pleasure to eat here. Compliments to the chefs and staff, keep up the great work. I always feel like home here.",

I usually go to Bake N\u2019 Tings, a popular Trini restaurant in the area. Their corn soup is to die for. It\u2019s excellent, but they only serve it on Monday\u2019s. I came to Tasty Caribbean to try their soup, and Lord did I waste my money. The corn soup is disgusting. I\u2019ve had corn soup from muiltple Trini restaurants and people from Trinidad, and this is the first time I\u2019ve actually disliked corn soup. First of all, when I came into the restaurant the soup was so thick like a stew. Clearly a LITTLE bit of water needed to be added. I asked them if they have any more new pots of soup in the back or if need be, can they add a little of liquid to the current soup. Why did these people add the whole Atlantic Ocean to the soup?? They diluted the soup soooooooo much I was so confused. Even if it wasn\u2019t diluted, I\u2019m sure it would still have the same horrible taste. Please tell me why the soup tasted like pure GOLDEN RAY (Trini Margarine) and water. No flavor, nothing. Tasted like pure butter water. I bought two soups, one for me and one for my friend. I let my friend try the soup without warning them about how nasty it was. They spit the soup right out just as I expected. We both thought the soup was disgusting. Do better next time!! Put some tender loving care into that soup. I usually dream and crave corn soup, your corn soup gave me nightmares!!!! Ugh I want to throw up everytime I think of it. And by the way your soup is way over priced. You charge the most in the area for a large vegetarian soup. All the other spots in the area are $6 or less. Do better!!",

I had the Goat roti, the meat was super tender and delicious, added bonus was the roti skin it was soft and had a very consistent flavor. I would personally rate it as one of the best roti spot in the area, you have several pleasant roti options to choose from conch, ( lambi) shrimps, chicken (boneless,) duck, fish, and goat, plus the usual caribbean dishes as well and locally made caribbean drinks. I definitely will be returning once am in the neighborhood. Go have a bite you will be thanking me for years to come.",
