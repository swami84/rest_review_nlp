All of the food just tasted salty with no other flavor. The teriyaki chicken didn't even have teriyaki sauce on it, it was just salted chicken on a skewer. The chicken wings tasted like old chicken that had been sitting around for days before being cooked. When I bit into it, there was a disgusting rotten taste close to the bone. The vegetable fried rice also tasted just gross. It seems like the food was tossed together with barely any care and I spent over $70 on this order. Such a waste. I will not be ordering from here again.",

I had the hot and sour soup and that was the best part about the lunch.  The main course I had, beef with string beans, and kung pao chicken were   pretty good as well.  I plan to come for dinner and will order a large bowl of those delectable hot and sour soup.  The service was excellent, the ambience was great, and the food was good and authentic.  Their dinner prices is a little high but if the quality of the food for lunch is indicative, I think it's worth it.",

The daily special of \"spicy fatty beef hot pot\" was using lean and tough beef shaving pieces in insufficient quantity for the price.  Another dish with cut pieces of celery included the inedible root part.  The stir fried string beans still had the inedible fibrous string part which is customarily removed for a well made dish.  The service also was sub-par.  We were given only a small glass of water in the beginning and it was never refilled even when I put the empty glass at the edge of the table to attract attention.  A Sichuan spicy food restaurant that doesn't serve ample amount of water?!?  Hope you have a better experience if you do decide to visit.",
