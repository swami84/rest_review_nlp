It's run by a young sweet couple who opened up during Covid. They basically have the BEST french fries I've ever had, and some pretty excellent tacos and empanadas. So psyched that one day I showed up and they had shrimp tacos too!!! I really hope to sit at one of their picnic benches again when the weather isn't so cold!",
