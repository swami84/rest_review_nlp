It had finely chopped vegetables in it. Delicious! It was all beautifully made, and very quickly prepared! (About 20 minutes waiting time). The smoothie tasted amazing...

Their delivery time is usually 30-45 mins which is decent, even when busy. However for some reason still not explained right, it took nearly two hours to deliver today. With my smoothie delivered melted and my food barely warm. When I called to see where it was the lady had said it should be there any minute because it went out awhile ago. Ummmm ok. 10 mins later I get it and I asked why it took so long since this went out awhile ago and the driver mumbled something and then said another thing about having to go all the way to 4th Avenue.  Why would you deliver mine last? I'm right around the corner. Pretty upset considering theres a $15 minimum and I had to order an extra item just for the delivery. So after tax and tip it's like $20 and it was a 2hr wait for a melted smoothie and room temp soggy pancakes. Going to have to go elsewhere from now on which is a shame since I ordered here at least 3x a week.",

Every time I get my food I always say I\u2019m never ordering from there and I end up doing it like a dummy. This places food is absolutely terrible. Today was my last straw. The smoothie I ordered came and literally tasted like water, the brownie was so hard, and the chicken felt like rubber.

At 8:10 pm, I ordered a meal from this establishment by calling them directly, did not use Yelp. My meal arrived at my door at 9:50 p.m.. The delivery driver smelled of marijuana and appeared intoxicated. I left $1.32 tip (total was $26). The driver left and I opened my food and it was ice cold. I called the restaurant and notified them the food was cold, and spoke to someone who identified himself as Carlos, the manager. Carlos stated he would credit the cost of the food back to my account and if I ordered again, it would be at no cost. I hung up. As I was heating up my meal, I received phone calls from a number I did not know to my personal cellphone. I answered after the fourth call, and it was the driver calling to confirm I meant to leave just $1.32. I said yes, the food was almost two hours late. I then said \"Do you know how inappropriate it is to call a customer's private cellphone to complain about gratuity?\" He then shouted \"GO FU*K YOURSELF\" and began to threaten me. I hung up and immediately called the restaurant to report what happened. I was very scared by how aggressive the driver sounded. I spoke with Carlos again who apologized profusely. I asked for the drivers name and was told it was Fred. I called the 86th police precinct in Brooklyn to file a report and was told to contact the BBB. Today, two days after the original incident, I called back attempting to use the credit to order the same meal for lunch. I mentioned to the young lady who answered who I was and she said she remembered. After placing my order, she stated the credit would be $3 off. I protested, and a new manager came to the phone. This manager said she could not give me a free meal and that Carlos was a cashier, who did not have the authority to say what he said. She then said, \"It's not my fault the driver is an AS*HOLE\". I simply could not believe this. I did say right then that I was surprised a manager would choose this language, considering. I tried to protest and ask for at the very least- more of discount but she refused, then placed the order taker back on the phone who then accused me of \"trying to start problems\". I kept trying to speak and say how unprofessional the whole experience was, but she turned the entire incident around on me claiming I was trying to cause an issue when this was absolutely not the case. I hung up, very frustrated. I did just report this whole thing to the BBB as the police advised me to do. For $26, this is how you treat a customer (who has ordered previously many times)? I refuse to believe, \"This is how it is in Brooklyn\" as the excuse for why a business would behave in such a way. A true shame. I advise anyone with money to be very careful if they decide to order from here and to check who the driver on duty is. They are rude, and it is unsafe for someone that unhinged to have your home address. Best of luck if you do decide to order. Appalling, all the way around.",

She wrote down my number and said they would send it next time. When I ordered again I wrote it in the special instructions. They were late so I called she said it was on its way and I asked about the drink she said she qoukcall the delivery guy and never called me back. On twenty more minutes later he gets here and no drink. I call her back complaining she said they were backed up on orders and would send him back. Well its been an hour and no drink and they supposedly closed 40 minutes ago! Terribleeeee!",
