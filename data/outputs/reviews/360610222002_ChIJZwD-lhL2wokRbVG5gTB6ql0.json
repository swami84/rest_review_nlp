We discovered it about 3 weeks ago and have already become regulars; the staff knows our faces and our order! Not a single complaint or shortcoming at this place. Absolutely amazing work all around. If anyone leaves less than 5 stars they are delirious. Not to mention the same meal (of lesser quality) downtown is at least double (if not triple) the price.  Dishes not to miss: -chicken tikka salad (the mango mayo dressing is TO DIE FOR and there\u2019s actually a good serving of chicken in there!) -chicken korma (perfect balance of sweet and savory) -gulab jamun (most amazing soft sweet warm fluffy balls)",

I entered on Friday evening at 9pm and first was told that \"the kitchen was closed\" and that they were only taking take-out orders, although there were people eating at various tables. When I asked to order take-out the lady behind the counter said I could only order from seamless, even though I was just standing right in front of her. When I pointed out the irony of that, I was told: \"do as you please but we are not serving any more food.\" I would have loved to find a new food option in the neighborhood but Delhi Masala is certainly not going to be it.",
