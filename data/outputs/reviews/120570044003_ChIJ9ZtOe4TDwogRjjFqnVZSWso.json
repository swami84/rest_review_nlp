While tradition reigns supreme at many of the nation's carnivore temples, you need to have good steak once in a while. My brother one weekend wanted to take me here to eat and he said eat very very light lunch, because I'm taking you out to eat tonight. He made reservations at 8pm, we waited in the bar and piano lounge for about 10min, while we enjoyed a cocktail.",

Food was prepared quickly.  Lady was kind as well in person which I definitely appreciated . Two teenagers in kitchen as well. Food looked good. But once I actually tasted it when I got back to my hotel, it was quite bad. I ordered 3 meals...oxtail for me and jerk chicken and brown stew for my kids.The meats were passable but the rice was parboiled rice that was overcooked with a sprinkle of red kidney  beans...was soppy and way too salty!  Definitely not Jamaican rice and peas. We got sides of macaroni and cheese because there was no more plantains and though I knew mac and cheese is not Jamaican cuisine , I was hungry. It tasted like it came from the box. Obviously I could've cooked my own oxtail and rice and peas as I'm Jamaican and can actually cook, but since I was visiting from out of town, I had to eat out but I was left very disappointed, out $30+( also bought soft drinks), and me and fam were still hungry as we couldn't continue eating this. I would give a 5 for customer service but a 1 for the food.",

What are the odds? My parents live near by so they will get to visit her and we plan to send our love every chance we get! Please give this place a try! The oxtails and goat were amazing!
