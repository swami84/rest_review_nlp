(They also have a small selection of wine!) The food is always good and you can't beat the affordable prices! My only complaint is that the bathroom is unisex but there isn't a door.. So I guess that's better? But not a deal-breaker, all in all great prices, good food, some board games and large TVs to watch sports. PS.. if you have a birthday and request a sparkler then its a additional $2. I found that out by looking at my receipt but good thing I can afford that! Lol. (But please do better with the music! It's always bad lmao) and way too loud!",

They have other games there for groups to have fun with like jenga and connect four. All of us had a blast and will be returning again. Highly recommended. Adults only too.
