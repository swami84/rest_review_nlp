        "caption": "Glad to see this food option in the area! We tried the beef and lamb skewers along with a bowl of noodles and the beef crispy burger with fries.  The skewers are excellent and are a quick and easy food to grab, with a lot of flavor. The skewer special includes a noodle that balanced out the meal nicely. As for the crispy burger, it was ok, not as good as the skewer and noodles, but I would still be curious to try another flavor since the bun is flaky and crispy. The fries were definitely interesting! They melt in your mouth and I enjoyed having them, they are not your typical fry, but are in themselves good \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude0a  Overall, I recommend this place for a quick bite, they also have a great selection of bubble tea that is included in their specials. I\u2019ll definitely be going back for the skewers and to try their soup.",

        "caption": "Awesome new place in the neighborhood, authentic chinese seemingly northern but I'm not really sure.  Had an order of popcorn chicken, the pork crispy burger and biangbiang noodles. Popcorn chicken order was well executed and tasty and of considerable size.  The \"crispy pork burger\" is more like a crispy thin croissant with a tasty, but with no spice, diced pork sauce.  Nicely done, but a spicy option would be good.  But, the star of the show was the biangbiang noodles - thick chewy noodles with the pork sauce and some heat (not too much so that if you like it spice, I'd ask for more - but it was good by me), vegetables and cilantro.  Excellent. One note: I tried to do an online delivery order through the restaurant's website (in order to preserve their margins as opposed to enhancing Seamless's), but unfortunately it only permoits pickup orders and not delivery.  If you like thoughtfully prepared unusual chinese preparations, you need to check this place out.",

The food at Crispy Burger is unlike anything I've had in the neighborhood- I'd usually go to Flushing or Sunset Park for a meal this cheap & tasty. I ordered the pork crispy burger (it's more of a loose meat sandwich with a delightfully crunchy, flaky bun) and Liang Pi with beef. I recommend both. The Liang Pi comes with a Sichuan peppercorn sauce so prepared for the slight numbing sensation on your tongue.",

        "caption": "Actually pretty impressed with this place! All in all a really good authentic-flavor restaurant. I was skeptical when it first opened but was intrigued by the other reviews and good looking menu. We picked up the Liang Pi w/ Spicy House Special sauce and the popcorn chicken crispy burger. The \u201cburger\u201d bun is interesting- I asked before ordering to learn more about it. It\u2019s a traditional Chinese-style roll made with wheat flour, but no butter (so not like a croissant!). I would describe it as more crunchy than crispy, and a very simple flavor. The sandwich was okay\u2014 pretty simple, Very Crunchy with the crispy bun, popcorn chicken, & lettuce, and I think there could\u2019ve been more popcorn chicken.  I think next time I\u2019ll probably go for one of the more spiced variations like the black pepper beef crispy burger. The Liang Pi was really good! Cold flat rice noodles with a couple toppings, definitely spicy but great flavor and it helped that it was cold. The spongy topping that looks like fake chicken is seitan, I think. Also got a grapefruit slush which was nice with a true grapefruit flavor. I\u2019m very curious to try more things from the menu, like the soup noodles. Service was good too! The lady taking my order went out of her way to make sure my allergens were not in the things I was ordering, and the food was ready quickly after I ordered. Would recommend this place! I\u2019m hoping they do well so we can consistently have a restaurant in this spot\ud83d\udc4d",

They had a lot of flavor and not too much spice but enough. There's a nice selection of vegetables in it. We had it with the beef although I think I could probably just eat the vegetarian version and be very happy. The crispy burger would probably have been better without the tomato and lettuce. We did not care for the fries at all. They seem to be made out of ground potato as opposed to pieces of potato. Very strange texture. I hope they get better fries because we could use a spot where you could just grab really good fries.  Friends really liked the beef noodle soup!",
