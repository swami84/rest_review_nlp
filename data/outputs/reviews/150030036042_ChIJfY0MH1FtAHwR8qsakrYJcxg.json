Don't get me wrong, I still love pho noodles, but it is kind of the same after a while. Thai boat noodles offer richer soup bases and more varieties of noodle choices to change it up from the simplicity of pho noodle soups.  The Combination Beef Noodle Soup offers a rich and spicy dark broth loaded with hearty chunks of different beef. It is truly filling and satisfying, so you won't be hungry for a while.  For something way different, there is the Yen Ta Fo Noodle Soup. It offers lots of seafood in a red bean based broth that is impossible to describe, but something you must try. I am not sure if it is for everyone and probably need to be in the mood for it, but very good all the same.  The Crab Meat Fried Rice is a great dish to share. It has lots of crab meat that has been perfectly fried with onions in the rice. Simple on the ingredients, which is perfect for highlighting the crab meat flavor that comes out.  Of course they make classic Thai Green Papaya Salad, which is made fresh to order. The balance of ingredients really makes this dish a perfect starter or side with you order.  The place is very clean and well lighted. Service was friendly and fast. Over all value of their dish prices was very good and well worth it.  This review was written after my second visit and I plan to go again for sure, so yes, I do recommend trying it.",
