Today we were  asked to move from a table because a party was waiting, at the moment  for it.  We asked the host if the party already arrived and we were told yes they were in line checking in so we had to move. We moved, sat another table for an hour and the table we gave up remained empty until we left. This is not the first customer disservice I've experienced here, but this was the last straw. I was with my husband whose been a weekly customer for over 2 years. We won't be back. Management and supervisors know us by face yet they still continue to treat us second class. Goodbye denizen.   10/5 reply : As I said this is NOT the first customer disservice we've experienced here. Also I'm writing this at my husband's request because he was not ok at all. An apology was owed. He's spent thousands of dollars at Denizen since you've been open. He's disgusted at how's he's been treated. He's also a manager in customer service so we comprehend and understand very well the correct way to treat a customer.",

        "caption": "I went to Denizens to celebrate my birthday this last weekend. My fianc\u00e9 got reserved seating (2 hour limit), which I would recommend because it's a little limited due to Covid. This worked out well and we got a great seat on the couches, and the covered patio was very nice with how hot it is outside.  Beers were good and we got a couple to-go. I really enjoyed the Georgia Ave. Sour. The Brussels sprouts and the pretzel were excellent. Some others in our party got burgers and they were super generous portions with tons of fries.  The only negative I will mention is the outside food policy. I had brought some homemade cupcakes for my birthday. When we walked in, we were told that there can't be outside food or drink. That's okay (although I will say a little atypical for a brewery which typically have more relaxed policies for things like birthday cake), but then we're told that we can pay a $25 cake fee to eat our cupcakes there. I would understand if we were having a big party and expected Denizens to help us cut and serve a cake, but I had just brought 6 cupcakes on a plate to share with our family.  We ended up eating the cupcakes outside, right after we left, which felt a little silly, but I wasn't about to pay $25 just to eat 6 cupcakes on the patio. I hope that Denizens rethinks this policy, or maybe offers a little flexibility for smaller groups (Maybe just a $10 fee? $25 was more than the cost of the cupcakes). I totally get that this is their policy and it's their prerogative, but the experience left a sour taste in my mouth and I definitely enjoyed my experience there less than I would have otherwise.  I will also add that I skimmed Denizens website and don't see any mention of this policy. Maybe I should have expected it, given that they serve food there, but I was honestly surprised by this.",

As far as I know, dogs are allowed in the beer garden and I can\u2019t wait to bring my pup by for a pint. For non-beer drinkers, they have hard seltzer, wine, mead, and cocktails (made for 2-3 servings) also for sale.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating too. There is definitely a neighborhood feel to this brewery.",

I came here last year with some of my coworkers and the server was completely oblivious to what we ordered (2 different drink's were brought out by mistake). Food was cold after we ordered it, I asked for his recommendation and he didn't really know. He didn't engage with our party at all (It was a party of 10-12 people). Overall I had a decent time with my coworkers but I definitively won't be returning or wasting my time here again. I understand if you are new to the role/position but than you should speak up and explain that, otherwise people are going to make assumptions and question his competency. He didn't apologize or try to be emphatic toward the situation. Some people just aren't people \"persons\" and don't need to be in that kind of job.  The only reason I wrote this review is a friend was asking me recommendations for bar's in the area and I remembered what a horrible time we had here from before.",

The blonde is a shareable size and taste pretty decent as well. The decor is cozy yet spacious without that sterile and cold feel that some newer breweries have. We\u2019re here in Silver Spring for a few days and have decided that we\u2019ll be returning in the next couple of days. The service is excellent and everyone takes care of you.

The beer selection was excellent and the food was tasty. Our waitress was really nice and although she was rushed off her feet, service was personal and welcoming. Not 5 stars because of the attitude and rudeness of the barman. I planned to sit at the bar initially but he was abrupt, unsmiling and unwelcoming. I chose a table instead and planned to find somewhere else to take my friend; I didn't want to give my business to somewhere with such rude staff. The waitress saved the day - she was friendly and welcoming so we decided to stay. The barman stayed stand-offish all night; he brought drinks across to us when the waitress was busy and slammed them on the table without speaking. The space itself is great - warm, cosy and with a fab atmosphere, I hope to be back someday \ud83c\udf7b",

Their food menu/setup/chef has changed so many times, I'm just going to say that it's always been good food and moderately priced and leave it at that.  The basement space and outdoor space provide a great atmosphere, the upstairs has couches and chairs for lounging when it's not too crowded.  Recommendations:  If you know your beers (if not, chat with your waiter) select two or maybe three and ask for a small sample and choose your favorite.  Sours are not for everybody but if you appreciate them like I do, theirs are excellent, as are the higher ABV Trippels when they're available.  Definitely stop in and ENJOY!",

That\u2019s insane for a hockey puck sized cheeseburger with onion jam and one piece of bacon. It was tasty but I would go literally anywhere else for a cheeseburger and pay less for 2x the food.

        "caption": "Horrible experiences. I have had several occasions of blatant discrimination in this establishment. I have given them several chances to correct their behavior but it seems like they prefer to only cater to Caucasians. We were told to move from a table by the entrance for no apparent reason then when we moved downstairs, a manger approached us told us to leave. I was in complete shock on this unapologetic racist behavior. There was no act of public drunkenness or disorderly conduct on our part until the server and manager decided to jump in our conversation to tell us to move first then leave. I have never been a kind to write reviews about businesses as employees don't always represent the establishment but this was a pure act of haterade. Great beer but horrible service from server to manager. They sure got a mouth full from us before we left. I will not walk pass this place ever again which is what they exactly want. I'm expecting the staff to respond and claim we were belligerent.  Response to Emily,  How convenient we would start harassing your staff 4 years after becoming customers. Whether you believe it or not we're regular customers of your establishment (all of the staff were new faces yesterday.) The server who approached us and requested that we put down our drinks (contrary to your statement about us requesting more drinks) initially served us your wings upstairs. We requested your goat cheese spread, but it arrived quite late (we were done eating) and it had to be returned. Whether that instigated anything, I'm not sure, but we headed to the tap room afterwards, as instructed by another member of your staff (he said we would find more seating.) We joined the trivia game there and continued to enjoy our time with everyone for what would have been a regular night.  Until out of nowhere our initial server approached one of my friends and asked him to put his drink down. As a longtime customer himself, he didn't see why he was singled out among a crowd and BOTH your employee and my friend began arguing. We left because we were very much aware that involving police is a complete degradation and escalation of the situation. Your inability to manage such a simple situation without escalating to calling cops shows a lack of professionalism at best and a complete disregard for safety at worst. It's a brewery, people drink. If you feel the need to set limits, do so, or hire security (or don\u2019t just hire new people every season and not train them.) you don't get to hide behind some sponsored napkins and \"black lives matter\" to completely disregard the lack of common sense and professionalism your establishment displays. Thanks for this new experience. We'll miss the patio.  Response to Emily,  Let me start by stating that you were not there to witness the unprofessional and agrressive behavior your staff approached us with.  We DID NOT initiate the conversation with your manager. A lady that labeled herself a manager walked into our group, interrupted our conversation and told my friend to put his drink down. She harrased us. We never asked and got turned down for alcohol(contrary to you claiming you cut us off.)  We had full beers in our glasses when she approached us aggressively.  What's pathetic is the lack of training your staff has.  What's pathetic is that your staff singled out the only black group from a group of 100 people and requested we put our drinks down and leave.  What's pathetic is your staff was not comfortable having us at your entrance and told us to move.  What's pathetic is your server brought goat cheese 20 minutes after we finished eating.  What's pathetic is your approach to every bad review below and on other platforms in diverting the issue of your service and lack of professionalism. You falsely stated that our group has been a problem before while this is the first time we came as this group.  I noticed that you have several other groups of people that wrote similar reviews after they suffered exactly what we experienced.  I'm fully aware now your problem goes way beyond us.",

If you are planning to come here I hope you aren't planning to have TOO much fun because I guess that's what my friends and I did on a Sunday AFTERNOON.

We we're certainly not affecting those around us (as there was hardly anyone there and if there were they enjoyed our shenanigans and assumed they were out of good fun enjoyed it) after all, they themselves hand out games to be enjoyed.  Management is terrible and completely unprofessional (hence them physically touching female/male members of our party), most of the staff is unpleasant except the one woman who sadly must've left when this all happened. Especially the one gentlemen in the hat who continued to act like I as the guest was in HIS way continuously through the afternoon.  Long story short, we tried to have a good time for a friend's 30th birthday but we were stopped by the very unruly staff.  I was perfectly fine all day until I was told one of the staff members grabbed my girlfriend somewhat aggressively on the arm. We have been out drinking together many times over the years and a situation such has this has never arose. Therefore, I take this physical altercation very seriously and do not expect my girlfriend to come back to be with such a complaint when we are being perfectly cordial and spending a lot of money in a place of business.  You didn't cease alcohol service to me and I be left a 20% tip so get your facts straight. I'd be perfectly happy to never return or never drink your beer again.",

If the weather is not agreeing, you can move indoors to either the small upstairs dining room or the downstairs bar and tables which are generally a bit more sedate. Finally, you can try the outdoor patio downstairs which is quiet and intimate.  The whole reason you came here of course was the beer, and Denizen's own brews go across the spectrum of styles so you're likely to find something you like. As far as food goes, I generally stay with the salads when I visit and they've never disappointed.",

Go and order a beer and sit at a table with someone new. There is always a good rotating beer selection and the food is pretty decent bar food. Also, there is a huge parking lot a block to the west (Kennet Street Garage) that is free on weekends, don't bother circling for street parking. Make sure to buy your DD a lot of food.  Lots of families and kids running around so not the place to get totally wasted, though occasionally people do.  Live music selection usually starts around dark on the weekends.",

        "caption": "Just earlier today I came here for the first time with two others. I really like the feel of the place. I love the patio, it reminds me of mcminamins(if you've ever been to Oregon). The space inside is not crowded with tables. I didn't get a chance to go downstairs, perhaps next time. My server was great and had intimate knowledge of the beer.  On reviewing the reviews, I really like that Emily(the co-owner) responds to every single one (even if they are not well done or rude).  However, I cannot give the remaining two stars for two reasons:  1. We ordered the pretzels first and they did not arrive until we had finished our meal and were ready to leave. We did really like the stone ground mustard. Is there wasabi in it?  2. This is the real problem. Each of us ordered the kitchen burger the same way, with bacon and cooked medium. We even said that it was OK if it still mooed at us. When they arrived, each of them were cooked  well done. Pretty much makes them dry. Which is incredibly unfortunate because the goat cheese and tomato jam are excellent toppings and it only failed because of the lack of moisture. The two smaller patties I think are a good idea because the toppings are less likely to slop off the backside when biting.  In the end, we did ask for a discount on the burgers because they were not cooked per the order. We did receive that discount and it was exactly what we had in mind. I do find it concerning that we had to ask for this to be rectified, rather than the shift manager coming to our table.  All that being said, I will return if I am in the area. Denizens has a full calander of events and live music, and the specials for happy hour are competitive. The menu is simple, and has something for everyone, yet it's not packed with items you could get across the street.",
