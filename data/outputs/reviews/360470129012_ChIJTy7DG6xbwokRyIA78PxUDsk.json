The ravioli was especially confusing - being very sweet yet ladled with Bolognese made it unclear whether it was a main course or a dessert. The sea bass was well cooked, however, lacked sufficient seasoning. The rabbit was somewhat dry and tough. Lasagna was nothing to write home about. Overall, had higher expectations, though the atmosphere was very cozy and romantic.",

The service waiter did not want to make the accommodation to our preference at all and choose to continue to say that we could not sit in the seating arrangement we originally wanted.

If you\u2019re a Black person please don\u2019t dine here they don\u2019t want your money",

After visiting the Italian countryside a few years back I longed for that Italian experience of delicous food and I would try to find it here again in NY. I hit the jackpot here! Plus we found some olives in jar in the mini grocery area and threw those in with the order as well. To my fianc\u00e9 and my delight we raved about every bite of the food. And the olives where by far the best we have ever had! Thanks for putting so much love in the food and making such special dishes. Everything was very special! ( Side note for the owner: I thought it was an antique shop walking by one day so I didn't notice it.. but my Fianc\u00e9 noticed a menu outside another day when we where walking together and that's how we didn't just pass it up and walk by, with out ever noticing it was a restaurant)",

When i walked in, the first thing he said (older Italian guy smelling repulsively like cigarettes and not knowing what personal space is) was to ask me how I spelled my name after he clearly had it written in from of him on my reservation. Didn't really pay much attention as it happens often. The only table they had was upstairs where there were several crying babies, so I asked if they had a table downstairs, he said no and proceeded to convince me the table he is giving me was the best in the restaurant. I said can you give us a minute to decide and we sat down. 3 mins later he comes and I told him we decided to stay and his response was 'well, don't feel like you are doing me a favor staying. If you don't like it you can leave  I feel like if you aren't 100% happy with the table maybe this is not a good fit for you and you can find another place' What a salty man, If I were with guy friends I was gonna tell him exactly how I felt and the way he spoke to me was unacceptable. But I composed my self and told him, thank you for your hospitality, hope you treat other better. The food could be good, but if someone gets in your face and is being rude with you in front of a lady, a bad review is the least he deserves.",

Ten minutes later we were seated downstairs in a wine cellar crowded with bottles. We right away ordered a few appetizers, an amazing stuffed quail and a charcuterie board to be followed by two massive ribeye steaks that came on wooden cutting boards and sliced at the table by the server. The stakes was perfectly cooked and it was amongst the best steaks we ever had, we paired it all with an excellent carignan from Sardinia suggested by our knowledgeable server Mirko. It felt as if we dined in some rural town in Tuscany. We will definitely be coming back.",

It is not often that you find rabbit on the menu. And it\u2019s less frequent even when you do find it that the meat is tender and delicious. There were so many fun things to try for example, for appetizers we had the octopus, the artichoke, burrata, and the salad. I probably could\u2019ve stop there. But we went onto a main entr\u00e9e with a number of different options all very delicious. The steak was made exactly to her liking medium rare on the rear side. And it was carved tableside perfectly. We also had the Seabass. I was very happy that we were able to order a deboned. I never enjoy taking bones out of my mouth while I\u2019m eating.  For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, the flourless cake, and custard which of the three was my least favorite. The tiramisu was very good and highly recommended. What I liked about it is that it wasn't overly sweet. Flourless cake was pretty good though I\u2019m not a big fan of too much chocolate that late at night. It was however about the only gluten-free option on the menu.  If I had one disappointment about eating here is that there was no gluten free pasta on the menu. I would\u2019ve thought by now that most restaurants would have a evolved their offerings to include gluten-free pasta. But all in all the dining experience was really good. I would\u2019ve given them foreign a half stars but half stars are not an option on this app. I really enjoyed it and I hope to return in the near future.  Oh and I really love the waiters hair design. He had this really cool style. I love when people take time for their appearance and also to say something really cool about their personality. It was a great experience overall.",

It is a rather small space, but they do have another room downstairs, which can be used for a private event.  We had a few appetizers to share; Burrata con Pomodoro e Basilico, and Ravioli di Mele. Burrata dish was fresh and tasty, refreshing on a hot, steamy day. Ravioli had a nice sweetness to it, packed with flavor!  We also had their infamous Carciofo alla Romana, which is a Braised Artichoke. It was unique and impressive. The heart was almost creamy, melt in your mouth.  They had a few special of the day, and one of them was lasagna. We didn't order it, but we got a small sample, and it was soooooo good!  For main, I chose Spigola al Forno, a \u2018Whole\u2019 Mediterranean Sea Bass It came out beautiful! One of the owners, Michelle, filleted it for me right there. The first bite of the fish gave me such joy...it was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed this dish very much!  My hubby went with Agnello in Crosta di Pistacchio, a Sicilian Pistachio Crusted Roasted Rack of Lamb. It had a great crunchy exterior with plump and juicy inside. Packed with flavor, tender and very satisfying.  We ended with Tiramis\u00f9 and Torta di Cioccolato. It was one of the best Tiramis\u00f9 and flourless chocolate cake I\u2019ve ever had!  We had an amazing dinner here, I am so happy to have discovered this restaurant! Everything we had was superb, we enjoyed them all from the first bite to the last. Our main server, Valentine, took a great care of us. If you want to have some authentic, delicious food with family and friends, or have a very romantic date, this might be the perfect spot for you!",

Not a problem we waited and becuase there was no space I waited outside and sat on the bench in the cold. My Husband called and said our table was ready . The waiters took us downstairs to one of the tables, this made me happy because we were not upstairs with all the commotion. The waiter came over we order sparkling water and then the hostess or manager whichever one she was came to our table and asked us to move. I was completely taken back people began to stair and look at the only two African Americans in the the restaurant as we are being asked to move upstairs becuase she promised another couple a downstairs table. So we get up not making a fuss although I was HIGHLY UPSET. Thinking we were going to get sat right away, again we had to wait while the other couple was politely moved from the table at the door downstairs to our table. I do not understand this type of customer service. There were 3 other seats at the long table we were seating at downstairs.  ( pleanty of room). To make matters worse the hostess or Manager bribes us with a free appetizer as though thats going to make our dining experience more enjoyable. We sit at this uncomfortable table in the corner cold and all.i can see at eye level is the other patrons waiting to be sat and I have to look at there backside while I try to enjoy a meal. I was so taken back and upset and this type of service my husband and I walked out. I will not be back nor my husband and our  company business luncheons and dinners we will take elsewhere.",

The host walls up to us asks if we have a reservation, we say no...hethen tells us that the wait will be an hour for a table...as I said mostly empty restsurant.  The website made no mention of required reservations and indicated that the wait during peak time was about 15 minutes...perhaps it was the fact that we both have locs that changed the wait time in a mostly empty restsurant to one hour...even the other patrons looked uncomfortable when we were told the wait time...you never know who you are refusing to serve just based on appearance. The one star is  because it looked like a very cosy and romantic place...we will never know. Shameful!!!",

There is a good reason for so many people. The food and the service  Andrea (Italian amn) was our server and he was so attentative to all our needs. I am pretty sure some of the guests drove him a little crazy but he was making sure we had a great time, and he succeeded. We started out with charcuterie and the board of cheese and dreid meqts were amazing, especially the one with the guava. We had quinoa salad, some salad with shards of cheese, the burrata, the stripped artechoke and the shrimps. Thats the way to enjoy a place to start. We also had the Rioja wine that was 100% tempranillo. It was quite nice and delicious to drink. Some of the female guests had white wine which they enjoyed. They entrees we all had differed from Lamb chops, red snapper fillet, there was a hen and a type of ravioli not made from pasta. I had the snapper which was well prepared and really good. We ordered the 3lbs steak to share and wow is all i can say. The service was getting better since it was getting late. We also had some good service from other waiters and Elenea. I dont know how to spell her name and she was a treat to converse with.  What a night and we left there closing out the place and enjoying a cery evening.",

That was the last positive thing I have to say about this place. Here comes the problems:  Stay us at the front of the restaurant and only gave us 6 seats. I told them the reservation was for 7. They didn't offer a bigger table, to accommodate the additional person, just another chair. Bread: The bread they put on the table had a piece of metal in it.  Not a small smooth metal, but something with spikes in it.  I told the manager and he said, \"I'm so sorry, the bread isn't made here, we get it delivered on a daily basis\".  No Free  Meal, drinks or even dessert.  Food was bland. Service was slow.  I will never go back here!  Too many options in Park Slope for me to choke on a pointy metal object!",
