They taste like they were frozen and can tell by how they cook. The shrimp and soya patties come out looking completely different because they are cooked to order. And they are very good. The inside of the store is very clean and organized. I wouldnt go as far as saying these ladies are rude. The woman at the counter said hello to everyone who walked into the store when I was there and I ate my food there. About a 20 minute period on a early Friday evening so there were plenty of people coming in. I got my order in a timely manner and the lady even gave my son a pineapple soda which I thought was very nice. Did she have a big, fake goofy smile on her face? No. If you need that to feel better about yourself then you have a whole lot more to worry about other than this restaurant's cuisine. There is a difference of culture. I've been to plenty of Chinese restaurants where the staff is far less accommodating and wouldnt address you if you were on fire and no one bothers to bring up their culture, skin tone, or business practices. STOP POLICING BLACK WOMEN. And these comments coming from other people of color. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU.",

The woman went ahead and rang up my order for a tofu roti and was pretty much forcing me to accept it \u2018as is.\u2019 Her justification was that no one was there to make the correction?? So instead of getting a refund, I was forced to pay $1 extra for a patty and didn\u2019t even get my change from that.

There are far too many authentic Jamaican food restaurants in the DMV area to choose from to consider this place.  The patties that I ordered were dry and nearly devoid of contents. The Jerk Chicken sandwich I ordered tasted like frozen rotisserie chicken strips sprinkled with a small amount of jerk chicken BBQ that one can find in a normal grocery store. The bun and cheese barely had any cheese on it. All of this was ridiculously priced for no reason, because it is clear that they aren't importing ingredients.  Other than that, the staff was nice enough and the location is quite convenient. However, I arrived just 10 minutes before the five guys opened and decided I couldn't wait. If I could go back, I'd wait an hour for Five Guys before ever considering this place again.",

For much better tasting food and a better value, I recommend trying the Jamaican restaurant on the other side of the mall, Kingston arbor. Their oxtails are pretty good but their jerk wings are my personal favorite.  I'd also recommend Caribbean Citations in DC. They're my personal favorite! All of their food is great and you really get your money worth.",
