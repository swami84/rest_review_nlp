I NEVER ask for salt, at an Italian restaurant (or any restaurant to be honest) but this is the first time I had to.  Our appetizer and dinner took so long to come out (at least 25/30 minutes for the app and over an hour for dinner).  I just want to point out that our server made sure the food came out hot so it was not the server's fault.  The Wild Boar Pappardelle tasted like they tried combining two different plates.  It honestly just did not taste unified.  It was also very bland.  The Black Gnocchi with lobster cream sauce tasted did not have the slightest taste of lobster to it.  The Tortellini Mignon was just alright.  It did pack more flavor than both the Black Gnocchi and Wild Boar Pappardelle combined.  AJ, our server, was kind and courteous.  He's the only reason why I gave this restaurant a 3 star review.",

The bread and cheese are fantastic and come from a common serving table in the middle of the restaurant. It's not cheap, but you pay for consistency and quality.

There were several other tables in the restaurant but it was not crowded. The table next to us also saw the rat and both parties mentioned it to the staff. We left the restaurant before receiving our food and the staff waived our bill. I\u2019m sure the food would have been fine, especially for the price per dish, but I have no intention on returning to Floriana or ordering food from them due to rat sighting.",

However, the food is just ok. I had gnocchi for brunch - very simple with a standard marinara, nothing spectacular. Burrata is made fresh in house but not quite as creamy as I hoped. My friend took a lasagna to go and may have had food poisoning after. Also, although they had mentioned that cocktails and wine are half price on Wednesday, the wine only applies to bottles. I would give it another chance before a final verdict but so far it's just ok in my book.",

I got the Fazzoletti with Short rib which was mostly just buttery pasta. My friends fillet mignon was cold by the time it got the table and the shrimp and scallop dish was quite tasteless as well. Not sure i would come back here..customer service was decent but food left a lot to be desired  2.19 Update..I was reached out to by Mgmt and compensated for the cost of the meal and offered a chance to return to the restaurant to try again..quite impressed with the prompt response to the issues we faced and look forward to trying Floriana again.",

I prefer their atmosphere to their food and I would normally rate them four stars, but our recent experience was just terrible. We live around the corner and we\u2019re looking for a nice night out so I picked up the phone and secured a reservation for an outside table at 7pm (I emphasize this to make clear I spoke to an actual person). How disappointing to find out that when we arrived at Floriana a female staff member told us they only had a table for us inside, because they don\u2019t take reservations for outside. Confused I tried to explain I actually spoke to a colleague of her that afternoon who had written down our request and never mentioned this to me. She told us we could wait for a table to open up and then proceeded to seat another couple - who were walk-ups and had arrived just before us - to the last available table outside. After that she just ignored us. We were left standing on the sidewalk in the cold. Nothing was done to try to make up for their mistake or to at least make our wait a little less uncomfortable. Excuses would have been nice, but no. This is not how you treat your guests who make an effort to support your business in the middle of a pandemic. Another staff member walked up to us, and after making his round, told us we would probably have to wait for at least 30 mins for a table to open up. Disappointed we left, and we\u2019re thankfully greeted with open arms at Annabelle.",

The surface is crisp, the sauce is not too much, and the top vegetables like kaiware also add to the taste. I think that the volume is also satisfactory for those who are asked for a large serving in Japan. It was good that the waiter's sense of distance was not too close and not too far.

He mentioned that one of his italian waiters didn't do side tasks and proceeded to say that \"I didnt know that all Italians were lazy.\" My family has Italian heritage and we did not take kindly to his words. My father was turning red in frustration from the incident. We may return for the food but if we see that manager again we will take our business elsewhere.",

The wine list was impressive and even offered a Super Tuscan on the by-the-glass menu which is pretty much unheard of (obviously nothing over the top, but still, a nice touch.) We even had a chance to chat with the manager afterward who was very kind and genuine. The only thing was kept me from giving that last star was the service; it was a busy friday night, but the service was pretty erratic (still not sure which waiter was our waiter, we had three different types of water given to us, other \"first world problems\" that aren't actual problems in reality at all...) Still, I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for quality italian in DC in an intimate setting. We had a lovely night!",

It feels very independent and love-worn, the service was wonderful - Rishard our waiter was full of passion and knowledge about the menu - we did ask for greens with our mains and that got forgotten but the ambience was good enough to let it slide. It was lovely to see full LGBTQIA+ representation across the staff and it was a memorable evening. We left feeling full and content. Definitely go here and put your money into a gay indie restaurants - screw those chains! X",

Other dishes served on time were not hot, no one came to get drinks order, no one asked how food was, and had the overall feeling no one is in charge. Two stars for friendly attitude of staff who somehow got away without taking responsibility for the poor food and service.",

The service was excellent, and after inquiring about our visit, our waiter brought us a decadent complimentary tiramisu and birthday card from the staff. Seated at the windows in the main dining hall, we were able to watch the sun set by candlelight (Very romantic!). We both ordered the lasagna bolognese, which was beyond amazing, and so large we were both able to save half of our portions for dinner the next evening! Floriana made our evening so special, and we will definitely be back for more. Authentic Italian, incredible service, beautiful location- need I say more?",

I sat outside because the weather was great, and I really enjoyed it. The gnocchi was average; the pieces were too big to soak up the flavor, and the sauce was super light and not very flavorful to begin with. The gnocchi texture was interesting, I think mostly they were just way too big. The plate of food wasn't too big and I felt like I could've eaten more afterward. Service was good, as my water was refilled appropriately and I was asked how my food was (although I was asked too soon, basically after I ate my first gnocchi, I was asked this question). The bill was around $13 post-tax which is not bad at all for Italian food!",

The last time, I vaguely remembered it as ok but nothing special. Nothing has really changed. Nothing was bad, but with so many really good places  a few minutes walk away, I can't see why I'd come here again.  There are several fairly traditional pasta dishes, like butternut squash ravioli. But again, nothing special or different enough to tempt me back.  They do have a fair selection of wines, quite a few by the glass. Service was fine, and I don't really have any complaints, but they're simply not up to the nearby competition.",

The lamb gnocchi was satisfying and delicious. The pasta is made in house to perfection. The tirimisu and chocolate moose are rich without being overly sweet - definitely worth the calories. The service was outstanding. Portions were generous. We will return soon, and will suggest this place to anyone hungry for fine italian food in a relaxed, intimate setting.",

The restaurant space is a small row house (narrow and steep staircases). The tables are close in proximity and the lighting is dim. The bar is LIVELY and well-lit and on the basement level.  Went with two childhood friends and we each ordered something different so that we could try each other's meal. We each had a different drink (I had an Impeachment and it was delicious, made with peach schnapps and bourbon). The meal started with sliced crusty bread and pesto (very garlicky and made with basil, as pesto should be). We shared steamed mussels (white wine, garlic, butter, parsley) and calamari fritti  (spicy tomato sauce) as appetizers. Calamari was not too salty and not chewy. The mussels were okay, to me. I think they could use a little \"kick\" of something.  One friend had the SCALLOP & SHRIMP RISOTTO (diver scallops, shrimp, white truffle oil). She had the BEST meal at the table. risotto was cooked to perfection and the scallops were cooked perfectly. The dish was seasoned very well and there was plenty to share.  Another friend had the SUNDAY GRAVY (pork belly, meatballs, sausage tomato sauce, ricotta, penne). This was DEFINITELY the heaviest of the dishes, but soooo good and tasty. The meatballs were amazing.  I had TORTELLONI MIGNON (tenderloin, tomato cream sauce). It was tortelloni stuffed with seasoned filet mignon. Tasty with an amazing cream sauce.  I would DEFINITELY give this place another visit to try their other dishes. One of the best meals I've had at a restaurant in a LONG TIME.",

It's almost like you're (literally) in the home of a loving relative, with the warmth you get at an extended family gathering. The wait staff is attentive and friendly, inviting you to try the specialties that will comfort or give the option to try something new. For the appetizer we shared the Black Gnocchi, a wonderful lobster and shrimp dish. For dinner, I had the tortellini mignon and it was amazing! I suggest being open to exploring dishes and sharing, as there are so many options. If you're up for it, pair the meals with a bottle of wine (a great value over glasses of wine), and you'll be set!",

The cozy restaurant is bursting with flavor and reminiscent of the Osterias in Italy.  I love how the complementary Tuscan bread comes with olive oil and basil - true pesto. We enjoyed the bread basket, not a crumb was spared.  The creamy Burrata with sweet potato puree was divine and paired well with the bread. The plump burrata was so soft and juicy that it melted in my mouth. Hands down the best burrata I've had!  The Butternut Squash was another crowd-pleaser. The squash was well seasoned and the goat cheese and greens added nice flavor.  The tender Burrata Ravioli with juicy mushrooms smothered in creamy pesto sauce was delicious! The al dente ravioli with creamy cheese filling, tender mushrooms, and basil white sauce blended well together with lots of flavor. Every piece was delightfully devoured leaving a nice clean plate. My guy friends all thoroughly enjoyed their hearty meat pasta dishes as their plates were also left clean.  The Tiramisu was tasty, but not a stand-out. We were all stuffed from the bread, apps, and entrees that we didn't save room for dessert. I would skip the tiramisu and go for the Chocolate Bomba next time.  The 1/2 price bottle of wine and Wed and Sundays is a steal! We got a delicious bottle of Chianti Classico for $26 (normally $52). The service is attentive and polite.  One weird thing to note - the bathroom is on the 2nd floor, above the restaurant. Go upstairs, not downstairs! There's a little bar downstairs in the basement by the same owners but not part of the restaurant (different menus and drinks). I wondered downstairs before climbing up a couple flights of stairs to the restroom - getting those steps in!  Definitely make a reservation a week or so in advance. There's only a handful of tables and seating for like 25 people. We were lucky and got a reservation on Super Bowl Sunday a few days in advance (didn't want to painfully watch the underdogs team get defeated by the Pats). Glad we made the right choice to enjoy some fine Italian dining instead!  Can't wait to be back for some creamy Burrata and scrumptious Burrata Ravioli!",

The outside of the restaurant is nothing compared to the interior. The atmosphere of the decor was elegant with the paintings hung around the room and the dim lighting with the red walls. The waiters and waitresses were polite and attentive, and of course the food was incredible. I wish I could remember the names of everything I had eaten there. My appetizer had a pesto that was sweet in a way I never tasted before. My salad was a simple and delicious fresh baby greens with a sherry vinaigrette. The pasta I ate contained duck in a special sauce which is absolutely something I think everyone should try at least once, it was the highlight of my meal, even eating it with bread alone was delicious, And finally for dessert I ate the blueberry lemon pound cake with an Italian coffee. My closest complaint would be that I couldn\u2019t taste the lavender cream in the cake, however my taste buds love sweets stronger than most, so I believe for everyone whose not like me would enjoy this cake and taste the lavender cream within it.  Take my word, eating here will make your night.",

High ceilings and somewhat of an intimate seating arrangement, it's hard not to hear the loud acoustics of the entire restaurant. However, I felt that those two things added personality to the place.  Each table to the side of us had raved about the brussels sprout appetizer, so we tried that along with the fried calamari. Both were outstanding. This gave me a really good feeling about the lamb gnoochi, along with shrimp & scallop entrees. Not only were they delicious, but I think I was even more impressed with the proportions. Often, with restaurants who focus on presentation, either the quantity or quality suffer. Not here. Overall... I'd highly recommend this place and have plans on returning as soon as possible.",

After hearing that lasagna was their most popular dish, I decided to try it. It was mediocre. The cheese layer was crispy and delicious, but it just did not live up to the hype. The shrimp risotto was delicious though. We were offered complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary though which was very sweet.",

My girlfriend and I went on a Wednesday and there was a special for half priced wine bottles! We had to get one went with a lovely red. For appetizer we started with a cheese board with a quality brie and some forme di formaggio paired with salumi, and olives! All was great! For our main course I got gnocchi with lamb which was pretty good but lacking in flavor. The lamb I will say was really good but again lacking in flavor but perfect texture! My girlfriend got the lasagna which didn't disappoint! We were really full after so there wasn't any room for desert. Overall great experience...but I will say I noticed I was the only non-white person, wasn't a big deal but something I noticed.  With that said I'd still go back because it was a good experience with great service a menu waiting to be explored!",

Floriana didn't blink an eye, and said they'd make it happen for us. Not only did we get everything we ordered in the time we needed, but it was also hot and amazingly delicious. Everyone raved at the quality of the lasagna, gnocchi, ravioli, fried chicken, salad and sides. Everyone knows food is the one thing that can help mend a broken heart in tragic times, and we thank the people at Floriana for providing all of hearts comfort with their gorgeous Italian cuisine.",

Our waiter was extremely friendly and the owner came out to talk to everyone as well. The decor inside was very quaint and made a great unique experience. The food was amazing as well. I had the lamb gnocchi and my wife had the seafood risotto. I would definitely recommend to anyone in the DC area and I would go back.",

The caprese (which includes house made fresh mozzarella), risotto, and the duck carbonara were all delicious - I think the vegetarian risotto was the best. Our waiter made a very good wine pairing selection, and the meal was overall wonderful. We had tiramasu and espresso chocolate mousse for desert, both delicious. The mousse was on the firmer side, yet melted in your mouth.  I mentioned top notch service. The waitstaff were courteous and efficient, if course, but the teamwork really impressed me. I was finishing a plate and someone who was neither a waiter or bussing staff (manager, I think) took the empty plate with no disruption at all. That really  speaks to great service and making the guests comfortable.  Finally, the ambiance was  beautifully romantic. It's an old town house with barely any changes, so you feel like you're eating a cozy dining room. I think our table was in what used to be the living room, and had nice false fireplace to boot.",
