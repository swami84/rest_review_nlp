The bobas also had the right amount of toothsome chewiness. I also liked that you could customize the amount of sugar and ice added per drink.

And order number E4 the Stew Chicken Minced Pork Rice.  A single meal is at LEAST 3 servings.  I recommend trying the exploding boba pearls or the pudding! I've never seen that somewhere else before.  Girlfriend tried their nuggets which were fried but very juicy!!",
