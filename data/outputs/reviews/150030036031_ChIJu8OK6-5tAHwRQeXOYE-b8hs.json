The location is a bit challenging and might be hard to find when looking for it, but once your are in, it is comfortable and relaxing.  The Korean aunties working are all very friendly and attentive.  Service is very quick and they do a good job overall making sure that you are well attended to during you dinning experience.  Menu has a lot of options and a few unique items as well.  Whether you are in the mood for some soup or a sizzling plate of bulgogi, they got it and it is all freshly prepared and very tasty.  My only complaint is that I thought their banchan was rather lackluster.  I am a big banchan fan and view it as a reflection of the Korean restaurant.  It isn't a deal breaker, but does weigh heavy with me especially if I had a bad rest of the meal, but in this case, I did not.  I do recommend this place and would return again to try some of their other dishes.",

The hours are 10AM - 5AM (virtually unheard of!) but that was definitely a plus as there aren't many food places you can count on to be open past midnight on a weeknight. We came around 7:30PM on a Thursday night and it was not crowded at all.  Parking: wasn't really an issue as we came late in the evening though I suspect it may be more challenging if you come earlier in the day. There were a few stalls to park right in front of the restaurant, although it was a little confusing getting out once we left.  Service/Ambiance: the overall vibe was pretty good. Relatively quiet and homey. The waitress was great-nice and attentive. We had a little trouble understanding her at times, but fortunately, that didn't become an issue and we were able to get exactly what we ordered.  Food: food didn't take too long to come out, which was nice. In terms of taste, it wasn't bad but wasn't great either. It was just okay. I'm not a huge fan of Korean food in general (not really into all of the pickled foods) but I have had better Korean at other spots. The menu was a bit of an issue for me because only the title of the food was in English, the rest was in Korean and we couldn't read what was in it, so we could only make a decision based on the photo and hope it tasted as good as it looked. I ordered the Spicy Beef Soup, which was okay.",

When I first entered the staff, I was standing in front of the entrance because the seats were full, but the staff didn't say hello or wait. It was unpleasant, but lunch was so cheap that I sat there waiting. But it was just the quality of the food for that price range. All the time, the unfriendly and blunt atmosphere of the staff did not provide any services other than bringing food, but he asked for tips. I'm going to calculate and go out, \"I'm not included in the service charge, you have to pay separately.\"  Tipping with beggar service doesn't mean you don't know the customary American culture.

The ladies working the front of house are awesome, super friendly, funny, extremely hospitable, and give great and super fast service! Food was really tasty, and came out incredibly quick! I got the bulgogi and rice in earthen pot, my husband got the bbq chicken. No frills, but totally worth it! Yummy, highly recommend this establishment!!",

Also when you ask for bbq and order meat and sit at bbq tables....you expect to bbq the meat yourself no?   Well they cooked it in the back. Must be decoration. :(  Food was good so ill give 3 stars but its deceiving and lack of service was a huge dissapointment. I won't be returning.",

        "caption": "Heard a lot about this place and picked up a groupon coupon couple weeks back to give it a try. WARNING, this place is tight! So unless your group of 4 are tiny, you might rub shoulders. But the food, oh the food was awesome. The boo goji was spicy but not over powering. The seafood hot pot was my favorite. Just enough crisp at the bottom with a full pallet of flavors. Rice was made just right topped with a selection of tasty shrimp, squid, and clams. The only dish that we thought was a bit weak was the cold noodles. Wish it had more ingredients. I would recommend this place for folks who enjoy Korean food. And yes, we will be back again!",
