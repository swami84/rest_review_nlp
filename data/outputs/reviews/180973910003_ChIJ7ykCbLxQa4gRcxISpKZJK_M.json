They have approx. 75 different wines that you can taste. And it's self served! Kind of like a soda machine dispenser but for wine!!! You load your card, pick a choice of wine, and choose the amount you'd like - 2, 4, or 6 oz. Each one has a full description of the bottle of wine. They also have fodd that you can order. The cheese tray is a great option and the flatbread pizza was really good! Great ambiance and good customer service! I definitely recommend this place!",

All the Bistro plates were much larger than we were expecting. It was Sunday, so there were a number of 1/2 price wines and shortly after we sat down, there was live music as well. If you want to sit down at a dinner table, this is not the place. But if you don't mind sitting in comfortable couches and sharing a number of \"small\" plates, this is a great place!",

We were not disappointed.  We were able to sit outside at one of the tall tables on a 75 degree day. Cannot beat that! Our server came over and discussed some wines with us. I grabbed a vino verde while hubs started with a local beer. After our second round, our server changed. No biggie, but then on our third round, our server changed again. That is really my only reason for the deduction of star. It started making us feel as though they didn't want us hanging around, but we did anyway.  There were tons of passerbys and it is in a great location downtown, near the shopping area so you can take in the city in all it's grandeur while sitting and enjoying some vino.",

We arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night expecting the place to be really busy. But due to the Colts/Patriots playoff game it wasn't. We grabbed 4 seats at the back bar and proceeded with our evening. This is only my second time ever being in this location before and I was happy to see a full bar especially since I am not a wine drinker. The service at the bar was exceptional and they were able to make whatever I wanted. Jonathon was behind the bar and he makes a fabulous Cosmopolitan! During the course of the evening there was wait staff that stopped by and made sure we were doing alright.  The only negative that I have to share, even though it isn't really a negative, is the prices at the bar. I ordered 2 drinks, and a friend put their drink on my tab... the total was $34.00. A Bacardi & Coke was $9.50!!! I expected a higher tab due to the fact that I had a Cosmo, but that was way more than I was expecting. Again, this isn't really a negative, but if you're on a tight budget this is not the place for you to grab drinks with a friend. If you are looking for a sophisticated lounge to chill and have a few drinks, then this is right up your alley.  I definitely will return for another fun filled, sophisticated \"gay\" night out!",

It was 4 of us with a taste for something better than your $7.99 bottle of wine!  The bottle selection is great, they have a taste for everyone! Tour Europe, Napa Valley and some of Italy's finest. I had the Merlot and it was splendid! God was it amazing! I recommend you go there and try it, at least just once. I am glad I did. Great service, great selection, great atmosphere.",

The receptionist at IRT mentioned we got a 20% discount if we showed our theater tickets at Tastings. Tuesday nights are also \u00bd priced wine nights so we figured it was worth a shot. IT WAS GREAT. I do need to mention that we went in on a Tuesday night at 530 but it was great. Service, food and wine all get a thumbs up. Waitress was very sweet and helpful. Food came out quickly. We got to try several very nice wines and each ordered a glass (1/2 priced!) and had 2 appetizers for under $40. We then got distracted by the art that is displayed all over the walls leading to the restroom. While we were looking at a painting, a staff member of the Conrad wandered up to us and took us on an awesome tour of the entire hotel and told us all about their art. Great experience. Highly recommend.",
