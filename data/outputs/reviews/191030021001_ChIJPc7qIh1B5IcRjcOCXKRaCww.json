Checked out the new website and there it was. I made my way from Cedar Rapids and on the way the owner replied to my inquiry if they were carrying it. She was happy to hear someone ask for the jalapeno limeade, but informed me they were closed for the day, but the owner was still there. She said she'd stay and wait since I was almost there and didn't want me wasting a trip. During my trip she went to the store, grabbed fresh produce and made it for me. THAT'S customer service! I bought 2 bottles, and a watermelon juice. Ashlie loved both flavors. Definitely worth the trip. And even though we're moving, we'll still be making special trips to this store (after calling ahead and preordering of course)",
