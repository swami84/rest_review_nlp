Traditional style of casa de la mamma, Italian music and all. House chianti is the best. Editing the review now to reflect another pleasant surprise. I returned for another round of the linguini, and ordered it to go. When I arrived at my office, I saw the attention to detail and perfect care of the staff at the Otello for making sure I had all I needed to best enjoy a warm meal despite the cold harsh winds outside. They wrapped the container with an extra protection, and even remembered the cheese as in my previous order. Thank you, Otello guys!",

The cleanliness is not 100%, so it could be better in some places, but only indoors, cutlery and dishes were clean. In the whole very delicious and nice atmosphere.

Die Auswahl ist \u00fcbersichtlich und passt zum Ambiente. Die Deko ist gut gew\u00e4hlt, wenn auch an einigen Stellen etwas kitschig. Preislich aber leider auch wieder etwas teurer als gewohnt. Das Personal ist aufmerksam, wenn auch etwas aufdringlich, so wurde man beim essen an die 10 mal gefragt, ob denn alles ok sei. Die Sauberkeit ist nicht 100%ig, so k\u00f6nnte es an einigen Stellen doch besser sein, aber nur im Innenbereich, Besteck und Geschirr waren sauber.

Dinner seems to pick up closer to 7, we came at 630 and there was only one other table. They do have house reds and white by the glass though I don't think they're on the menu. The food was good, sauced fairly heavily in a more American style. I got a crab meat and cream pasta, my fiancee got a sausage pasta I can't remember the proper name for and both tasted good and came pretty quickly. The fried mozzarella appetizer was a high light, as well as a good tiramisu that skimped on super strong Expresso flavor but did have a properly heavy mascarpone.",

Although the ambience and service was excellent Otello should be ashamed tp plate let alone charge for such inferior products and cooking...next time just serve an old bicycle tire and empty sea shells!!!",

One minute after we sat the waiter wanted take our orders and we had to decide under pressure and hurry. It was ok... until we hear a man on the back (probably the owner or a manager) screaming so loud a few Italian bad words in our direction. We are Portuguese native speakers and \u201cson of a b...\u201d is pretty universal among Latin languages. They are insulting their customers in Italian!!! We decided to leave immediately and we DON\u2019T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL unless you want learn some bad Italian words! Total insolence, lousy treatment!",

The meal was AMAZING- warm, thoroughly cooked, delicious, moist, the cuts of sausage I had in my dish were evenly cut. For two pasta dishes, one was the Sausage penne, the other the seafood pasta- it was $53. Amazingly priced, great service, even gave a free taste test of the dessert wine (they carded, I didn't get any bc I'm 20- but my boyfriend, who is 23, said it was amazing). ---I wish to add a photo of my dish, but I cannot find how to input it.

We started with the the bruschetta which was clumsily prepared and lacking. Tomatoes were mealy and the bread was overly doughy. The cheese was the highlight of the night. I had one of the specials, seafood linguine with scallpps, shrimp, mussels and squid in tomato sauce. Almost all of the seafood was overcooked and chewy. The pasta tasted like it had been sitting in water all night. Tomato sauce was thin and watery. My husband had the penne with sausage and while the sausage tasted good  he had the same complaints about the pasta and sauce. It then took fifteen minutes to get our check.
