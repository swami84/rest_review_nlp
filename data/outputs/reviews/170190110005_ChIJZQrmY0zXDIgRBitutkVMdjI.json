The 2013 Montepulciano listed on the menu was actually a 2018, and the taste of wine I had beforehand was sent out in a 4 oz beer taster rather than a wine glass.  Coursing seemed a bit off and took quite a bit of time in-between each dish, the kitchen seemed fairly busy but the quality of the dishes was great once they arrived.  Overall a good experience with a few spots for improvement. We will definitely give it another go, but I was expecting a bit better for the $180 tab for two people.",

Both of us had the try three menu that came with appetizer, main course and dessert. I had the octopus, seafood pasta and ricotta cheesecake. Octopus appetizer was amazing, pasta had the largest scallop I've seen yet on a dish in C-U and the cheesecake was delicious but not too heavy. Highlight for me were the negronis that were delicious. Downside was the price, (over 200 bucks), and the wife had the steak she requested at medium well that came out pretty pink. I would reccomend for a date night.",

Unfortunately our experience was ruined by far too much waiting.  After waiting 40 minutes after our reservation time to be seated, we had to wait over 2 more hours for the food to arrive. Someone who I presumed to be owner came to the table but just shrugged his shoulders and made vague excuses along the lines of \"we're busy\" with no semblance of an apology. The wait staff was working hard, but didn't seem to be supported by the kitchen or the management.  I understand that setbacks happen. Maybe kitchen staff had an emergency and couldn't arrive to work. Maybe the food delivery truck didn't show up today. If there had been any sort of an attempt to explain  the delays and apologize I may have given this place a second chance. I don't expect complimentary food or drinks to make up for problems, but a little gesture like a bottle of house wine for the table along with an apology would have gone a long way too.",

The gnocchi were the lightest, fluffiest gnocchi I've ever had. Cons: The food was good, but I wish they'd been a little clearer on the menu. I was trying to avoid dairy (not a life threatening allergy, so I didn't want to make an issue of it), so I tried to pick something that didn't have cheese or cream listed on the menu.  My gnocchi came smothered in melted cheese which was less than ideal. The other major con is that the place can get pretty loud. It  can be kind of hard to hear your companions.",
