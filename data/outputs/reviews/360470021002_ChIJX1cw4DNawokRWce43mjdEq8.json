I ran into Juice Press and said I need help, some sort of cold buster, and one of the cashiers/attendants suggested three options for me and noted his top pick. He was really knowledgeable about the ingredients and their effects. I purchased the recommended \"Ginger Fireball\" and an hour later, could not be more pleased. It is helping in the way he described.  Great product, great experience.  Thank you, Juice press.  I highly recommend a visit if you're in the mood for a juice, shot, or smoothie - weather it be for health, medicinal or enjoyment purposes. The flavor combinations seem excellent and the quality is great. As a Juice Generation regular, I must say that Juice Press surpassed my expectations and I will definitely be going back.",
