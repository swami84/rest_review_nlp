Honestly I\u2019ve been to many restaurants in Honolulu and this is the few times I felt happy from eating my food.     That is why I am writing this review. I will definitely go back with my family again.  The price was a little less then what you find in some of the more known spots. Nice portions.   What more can you ask for. The dress is super casual.    And the seating is pretty tight.  But that\u2019s not really a bad thing.",

I\u2019ll drive to Chinatown from Kapolei for this food. I\u2019ll find street parking on a busy night. I\u2019ll drag my keto husband along and make him break his diet, all for that amazing sweet and savory almond-and-raisin stuffed peshwari naan. God damned delicious.  The pekora, the curries, and the tandoori meats are all delicious too. I\u2019ve tried most of them. But definitely get the Peshwari naan. Even now, my mouth is watering.",

We are new to Indian food, so we can't quite comment on the particular flavors, but everything that we ordered tasted really good, we got the fish coconut curry, lamb curry, chicken saag, and chicken makhani, along with regular, garlic, cheese naan, and roti.  Overall everything was awesome.  The fish curry was the favorite of the four, the chicken makhani was good without a starch, the lamb curry was a tiny bit spicy but only after the initial bite, and the chicken Saag was great with the naan.  It was a fun eating experience, because we were able to dip the naan like they do on TV, that was probably the best thing about the whole experience.  The only issue was that there were a lot of large spice pieces left over. They either need to blend the spices better or strain them out. Too many spit out pieces...

They give you big portions which some other places won't but charge the same amount. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, especially to first timers. It took me 8 years to get my boyfriend to try indian food and the staff was so patient and answered all of his questions. Now he loves it and won't go anywhere else. MUST TRY is their Tikka Masala!!!!! Favorite at any spice level!!!!",

The location was simple enough to find (no parking, so you can either Uber or take the #1 or #2 bus and get off on Hotel St & Bishop). Adequate, but \"intimate\" seating. The lack of space is made up with the service and the food. I had the channa masala (ordered it medium spicy because I love some heat) and an order of garlic naan. I was a little sad they did not have the traditional chutneys for dipping my naan, but the flavor of the masala more than made up for that. Rice is included with your entree! The prices are reasonable (average for Indian food) and the portion sizes are substantial. I ate a lot in the restaurant and still had leftovers. Definitely worth coming again.",

Nearly all places have achaar, chutney as a complimentary side . Even if you ask for price, it should be reasonable. Price of achaar more than price of paratha - never seen anywhere else. If your food tastes good - noone should need achaar in first place.  After a long tiring day at Maui, I had to sleep hungry. I did not have energy to find another place and this was terrible.

        "caption": "I've had Kamana Indian Cuisine on my mind since March 2018 but have finally gotten around to trying them.  What brought us here to try them was our visit to the recent Honolulu Magazine's Best Of... Festival and their award-winning Biryani rice.  We wandered into this restaurant around 11:30am when it wasn't quite yet crowded with other downtown workers.  Since there were only the two of us, we were directed to sit at a table for two either along the front window or along the wall away from the entrance.  What struck us immediately was the very warm temperature in the restaurant which we figured to be because the outside temperature was so hot and our humidity just sat on our chests like an elephant.  But, there was an air-conditioner that was doing its best to cool down the space.  As we were walking to our table, our server followed us while bringing menus and glasses of iced water.  She was friendly and asked if we've eaten Indian food before or if we needed suggestions.  We did peruse both the regular menu and the lunch specials even though we already had in mind what we planned on ordering.  FOOD: -Biryani with chicken:  traditional aromatic Basmati rice tossed with herbs and spices with chunks of tender chicken.  The portion was huge, as my husband and I paired it with the lunch special, we had left overs.  Indeed, this Biryani rice was flavorful and reminded us of what we've eaten at Singapore's Tiffin Room (Raffles) and Little India neighborhood or Los Angeles' Badmaash Restaurant.   We agreed with Honolulu Magazine's voters for awarding this dish as a winner.  $15.95  -Saag Paneer (Lunch Special):  served on a Thali (compartmental metal tray), generous portions of saag paneer, yellow dal, vegetable curry of the day, achar (Indian pickles), half naan and basmati rice were steaming hot and appetizingly aromatic.  It was a good call to order this lunch special to pair it with the biryani as we got to sample more dishes than to have just ordered an additional entr\u00e9e of saag or curry or mixed grill.  After all, it was lunch time and we didn't want to overeat and fall into food coma.  $9.99  Food flavors, portions and value are excellent here.  Service was friendly though a bit spotty as the restaurant filled but still good.  There seemed to be more people ordering and picking up their takeout than dining in.  Perhaps they had already experienced the warmer room temperature of the restaurant.",

Do not be in a rush to gulp down the tika or cheese naan. Talking of the naan it is fluffy, thick, and chewy. It's a minefield of tastebuds pleasure. Like any other establishment there are quirks to the place. The selection is smaller than other places I've been to, service is slow but the waiter is nice, and the structural/visual layout is dissapointing at best. Try and go at times when it's slower for better service. Prices are fair.",

From the instant we opened the door, we were greeted by the enticing sights and sounds of Bollywood and the gentle wafting of fresh naan from the kitchen.  Upon sitting down, the first things that greeted our eyes were a delicate paper placemat and paper napkin to match. Not to worry, we were soon served a green cloth napkin upon a porcelain plate. It was a good thing that my dining partner and I had both wore green to complement the napkin. Next we received the gold-embellished menu, which was adorned with appetizing photos of the options. We were glad to see many options for vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters alike. We ordered samosas first. They were brought out on a silver platter with two delectable dipping choices. Our main courses arrived with a side of butter-brushed naan glistening. Our waiter had outstanding spacial awareness and an artistic eye for where to place the food for maximum dining experience. The food was excellent, but it was after we had finished eating that the true service began. Our waiter surrepitiously peaked his head around the corner to assess our progress. He did not rush us, like many restaurants you find in America. Finally, after I had concluded my post-meal nibbling, he brought us a thoughtfully arranged array of boxes designed to hold every type of leftover we possessed. He even, like a magician, produced a plastic bag designed to hold our one, treasured leftover piece of naan. As we stood to leave, I accidentally forgot my bag in the establishment. But I did not fret! When I stepped back in to retrieve it, he was already prepared to chase me down the steeet to return it to me. Overall, this was a delightful and delicious experience.",

Came here with similar expectations but was disappointed. The restaurant is near the lolani palace and is very small. The food itself was pretty good and spicy. However, as others have mentioned, the waiter acted like a weirdo. He wouldnt respect anybody, would do the exact opposite of what you would want. For example , to save time i went to the counter to hand my card. He asked me to go back to our table. Took his sweet time to pick up the cheque, but wouldnt come back to the table. Gave it to my mom who was leaving the restaurant and asked her to hand it over to me. Based on the reviews, i am not alone in my opinions about this guy. The other person who served the food was very polite.",
