The nova lox sandwich. This place understands that a sandwich is to be eaten like a sandwich, not an unwieldy pile of fish that falls apart in your hands and costs fifteen bucks. It's got cucumbers and sprouts and tomatoes, a griddled bagel, the right amount of cream cheese, and just enough salmon to satisfy without overwhelming or overflowing. If I wanted a quarter pound of lox slapped on a bagel I'd go to one of the many NYC institutions and do it myself. But this is a ten dollar solid sandwich that I could eat every day.",
