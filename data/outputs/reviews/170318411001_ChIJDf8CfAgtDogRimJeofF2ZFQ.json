We ordered the chicken with some green pepper, and I found a chicken has some blood on the bone. I thought it's a random issue, then I fount I was wrong: I tried other 3 or more chicken, and they are all raw in the middle! I can't believe it happens in a dish costs $18.95!! We asked the waiter, and they said they will cook it again for us. It sounds fine for us, however, when the dish is back, later a waiter come to teach us: that's how they cook the chicken, I do cooking so I know it. I don't understand why I have to be humiliated after having the raw meat. Additionally, this place is extremely overpriced. A Szechuan stew sticker, which costs me $18.95, only has two tofu, two mushrooms, some chicken meat, and mostly, they are chicken wing tips.",

Even the hot tea they bring you (we requested) is a delight. Officially one of our top chinese restaurants in the city now. Parking is typical city, find-what-you-can on the street. And don't be taken aback by the enormous floral arrangements in the \"foyer.\" It's a little hard to navigate past there, you definitely couldn't fit a stroller, but once you do, hello good eating! It's pretty streamlined inside. Very casual. A bar at the front. And the space is kind of set up gallery style. Long, slightly narrow and ends with a nice contemporary logo of the chef's name (I think). The service is prompt. If you have any special diet requests (like no pork or meat, etc.), make sure you are very clear. They will accommodate things like that. The menu is not as extensive as many chinese restaurants I've frequented, but they seemed to have curated a great list of varying items. You should be able to find something, including vegetarians. Prices are low to moderate. And although I didn't see for myself, apparently the bathrooms are on the swanky side! Not sure exactly when, but we will be putting them in our regular rotation for eating out.",

        "caption": "Outstanding new restaurant in Chinatown.  Just opened so a bit off the radar, but its one of the best Chinese meals I've had in Chicago.  Ordered seven dishes and all were first rate.  Hard to pick a favorite.  If you like spicy, then maybe the Green peppercorn fish soup, but Conch was surprisingly flavorful and tender.  Even eggplant with garlic and stir fried cauliflower were worth of repeat orders.  Rice cake with brown sugar made a nice dessert.  Picture of steamed pork ribs with millet also shown - succulent and tender.  Can't wait to go back.  They have a Chinese-only section of the menu that apparently is some kind of hot pot that you need to order in advance.  Maybe next time.  Lots on this menu to explore.",
