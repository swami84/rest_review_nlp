        "caption": "The atmosphere of the interior is open and cozy in a way; having the walls as glass facing the street makes the restaurant feel open and the furniture is well crafted, especially the bar top. The service was spectacular and the food was served with accuracy! Definitely a place to check out. Only problem is finding the building; the sign is small and the place could be unnoticed by anyone looking to find a random place to sit and eat. Still an amazing experience and I would definitely go again and again!",

Their tacos fuse the traditional \u201cstreet taco\u201d idea with a touch of extra culinary flair; the tortillas are homemade, the ingredients are superbly prepared and everything is finished with a thoughtful gourmet touch. The service was great and the staff was friendly. The owner / Chef personally stopped by our table to ask how everything was. Classy joint. Definitely looking forward to trying more of Zapata\u2019s deliciousness soon. Thankfully, I live around the corner... but even if I didn\u2019t... Zapata is totally worth the trip. Check it out, mi amigo. You won\u2019t regret it.",
