The serving size to price ratio is good; just under $8 for a very filling lunch. The quality of my salad was mehhh. The falafel was smothered in yogurt and hot sauce to the point that I felt like I was eating a buffalo chicken salad. But, more notably, my girlfriend got food poisoning from the chicken.  I gotta believe that this place has something to offer based on all the good reviews it has. I'd say check it out if you're on GSU campus and need a filling lunch, just hold off on the sauce if you want to taste the food and stay away from the chicken.",

The owner's Dad actually is a chef in Istanbul and has a chain of restaurants there employing 300.  So it was no surprise for us that every item on Ali Baba's menu that we tasted here on Broad street; was very palatable, very delicious, perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  We tried the Bakalwa for desert. Sinfully delicious. Like all other Bakalwas this one was not dripping or soaked in honey. The amount was just perfect.  Honestly, if you haven't eaten Gyro, falafal or for that matter; if you haven't  eaten at Ali Baba Cafe you have no idea what true good Turkish food tastes like.  I have spent two weeks in Turkey eating at authentic restaurants and even here in Atlanta at Turkish festivals and other so called authentic Turkish and Greek outfits. This is a fast food style cafe and seating is on the sidewalk.  All I can say is get down to 60 Broad Street, Atlanta GA. You will be  back.",

But it is very lazy for the restaurant not to warm it up.   The pita was good and the fixins inside were good.  I also got grape leaves.  They were terrible.  Very mushy and also too cold.   I also got a samosa.   That was also cold.  They said they could heat it up but in a microwave.   It is 2014, how can a classy place heat things up in a device that ruins food.  I ate it cold and it was pretty good.  I think if this place had their ingredients at the right temperature they would be much better off.  So if you want cold/luke warm food this is your spot.",
