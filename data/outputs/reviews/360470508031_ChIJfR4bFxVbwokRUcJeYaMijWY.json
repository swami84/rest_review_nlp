I really hate having bones in any meat I order and so I couldn\u2019t eat it. It was super hard and not well seasoned according to my mom who ate it instead of me. Also there was no ranch dip included either. They need to start listening to what their customers want, I don\u2019t get how hard it is to understand English. I feel like this is rip off of the Atomic wings which is in Jamaica, which serves great food btw. Save yourself the trouble, skip this location. Not worth wasting your money here.",

Mind you, it wasn\u2019t door dashes fault. A dasher was there to pick up the order 2 times!!! Yes, twice!!! It was not ready. I personally called the restaurant. They said the manager wasn\u2019t there. And some lady kept picking up. She hung up once. And then once again. Called and she hung up again. The WORST customer service anyone can ever receive. I\u2019m super angry upset and annoyed that I had to go thru all this unnecessary stuff to just get my lunch. Yes this is why I\u2019m leaving this review so the rest of the world knows the type of customer service you guys have it this place. And hopefully no one ever has to experience the horror I did - just to order some food!!! Whoever the owners are need to get there act together and there employees so that this place can function properly (coming from another business owner) you guys can\u2019t survive with this kind of customer service !!! Put some people in the front who know how to talk to and address customers. And not hang up on them over and over! If you aren\u2019t gonna have a manager on duty , atleast make sure your employees aren\u2019t making you look bad! I\u2019ll be sure to spread the word!! This is just step one. Now your looking at just about 2 hours on the order and still no food. Third dasher arrived to shop at said he got a response we were busy so are starting now !!! Super pathetic!!!! I hope whoever the owners are reach out to me!!!",

The  choices of sauces ranging from mild to hot you can't go wrong. They even have a unique BBQ sauce. I always go for the BBQ mixed well done with extra sauce ON the wings.

They are also kind of prices as well. They only offer delivery through third party services which is a little weird but that also comes with being short staff.

Atomic Wings in Brooklyn made the whole process from order to delivery so easy. You can order right online and the process was ideal with all the wings options Style, Size and Sauce right there for you. My guys always are specific in what they enjoy, so I ordered a detail variety of wings and it all came as ordered. We are just enjoying them now, but so far the boys are loving them. The only negative is that I now have to host the Super Bowl Party. Once you provide the incredible food, they will never want to go elsewhere. Atomic Wings in Brooklyn will be getting a sizable order from me in two weeks. If you want delicious wings and an easy to order/delivery process chose Atomic Wings in Brooklyn. You can thank me later. Enjoy !",
