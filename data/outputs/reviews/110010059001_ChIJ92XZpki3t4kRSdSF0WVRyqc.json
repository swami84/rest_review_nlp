It was a birthday dinner so we were dressed up and had a good time and the food was good.  The waiter was very helpful with selections and a little funny if I remember correctly.  Everything was good, even the water (and I am very picky about my water).",

Music plays just loud enough where you can have a nice conversation with friends or business colleagues and lets the local students study. I am quite grateful the owner opened her shop in the Capitol Hill/Union Station area, giving people here more coffee (and wine) options. I love supporting small businesses as well as women-owned business. The Ministry is both!! To top that off, the owner is soft spoken, very kind and POLITE to everyone that stops by. I have even seen her treat customers who have been quite rude (obviously these customers feel a sense of entitlement). A few weeks ago I saw her politely ask an obvious student to 'kindly remove her feet from the furniture'. and just last week she asked a customer to take their obviously-from-another-restaurant- food container outside. I was quite impressed at how she handled both situations. Yes, I am a regular AND A FAN. Kuddos for teaching 'kids' manners and proper etiquette!!! This is a nice establishment - take your nasty feet off the nice furniture! This isn't your house. And why do people feel it's ok to bring food from another restaurant? It is not! and these people then have the audacity to get offended.  I fully support The Ministry. If you ever find yourself near and in need of delicious coffee or a glass of wine, stop by! You will love it as much as I do. Oh, and ask for the avocado toast with fetta and prosciutto. Yummy!!! or the Pear and goat cheese toast. delicious!!! can't wait to go back!!!",

I can\u2019t wait for them to roll out the rest of the menu!

Definitely a social media driven place more than anything, pretty to look at, unfulfilling to visit. The staff is very friendly & energetic but lack a sense of expertise over anything other than a basic black coffee or their baked goods. Super let down as I was extremely excited to finally have a specialty coffee shop to get a properly made latte at close to work.  I ordered a basic cappuccino and there was barely any foam at all, no simple syrup available & the coffee itself tasted diluted and worse than anything I've ever even received at a Starbucks. I then complained & just asked for an iced coffee and still was left feeling unfulfilled and ripped off $ wise at best.  Might just be due to how new it is, but as of now I'm unimpressed. Will visit a few weeks from now to see if anything changes.",

It's also a business that seems to be banking on their Instagram game. If you scroll through their feed, you'll get the impression that they value beautiful design, speciality coffee, and fine wine. It's clear they want you to come and post on Instagram for your friends to see.  With that expectation, you may be a little caught off guard when you actually visit. It's in the bottom floor of an office building and half of the space looks it. It's plain and sterile feeling. Then you notice the pink espresso machine and the beautiful cushion seating in the other half.  In the mornings they serve coffee and muffins. I ordered an ice latte and it was good. However, they did not have simple syrup at the bar, just packets of sugar. The muffins are delicious. Small, but tasty.  I did go for wine, but their list is impressive and I'd go back with my wife for a date night.",
