Got there and the host wasn\u2019t even nice because we were late to our reservation trying to find parking. Then we waited 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. Then once we ordered fish and pizza the food literally came in 5 minutes. It was hard to believe the food was made that fast. The pizza was OK but there are definitely better places for pizza. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place... it wasn\u2019t worth the money.",

When we sat down another  waiter (male) came and gave us the menus, however while he was taking our order he was organizing the wines, he did even not look at us and he was about 7 feet away from us, he was turning his back on us. We were the only ones in the restaurant but, that waiter did not have a second to look at us and give a good communication to the customer?  They gave us drinks and fast food, it was very delicious, we love pizza and pasta there, but while we ate the waiter did not come to ask us what else we need or if everything is okay? None of them came to check if our glass of wine and water was empty. Even when paying the bill, I had to stop eating, stand up and go to the waiter to tell him that we are done and we want the receipt to pay.  Barano is a good place to eat however the workers at that place seem to not care when there are 2 people in the restaurant I imagine when the place is busy, so careless. The owner or manager should keep checking and observing how the staff are doing their work. I decided to pack our pizza instead of wasting one more minute being there.",

He left for Brooklyn to bless the lucky people of that borough. His food is even more delicious and inventive. There is a wood burning oven for pizza. A superb wine list. Creative cocktails. Simply great food. All of the pasta is made in house and the other entrees are marvelous. It seems to be a neighborhood favorite because i not only see a lot of regulars when i gobut i also run into other Manhattanites there from the restaurants that the chef used to cook at. It is a hike from my place to Brooklyn but worth it. There is also outdoor seating during good weather and they took the space next door for a wine store. Thanks Chef Al!",

Crust was light and flaky and the \u2018nduja pizza had the perfect mix of spicy and sweet with the Calabrian honey. Also great that they provide a pair of pizza cutting scissors so it makes it easy to cut slices however you want for a group to share.  Saffron gigli was the best pasta and a unique color from the saffron.  Good cocktail list named after songs from the 90s. Had a few, very creative. but some were a little too sweet. I preferred the ones that included mezcal  Great decor and vibe inside. We had a group of 8 and the staff made sure we were always taken care of and had full drinks. They have several different areas where it looks like they could seat larger groups if needed.",

They also had some NYE specials in addition to the regular menu, which we took advantage of. These included a very tasty champagne, crab arancini, and foie gras aglonotti. Also got their bread plate which was great as well as the meatballs.  The meatballs were the star in my opinion, pretty perfect. The cannoli is a bit weird for me, the filling cream is too thick and filled with dried fruit...It's like a fruit cake.  The shell of the cannoli was really good.  The managment staff and waitstaff worked together to assist with packing up leftovers and ordering dessert since our waiter was very busy.  There was a long wait between apps and the main pasta dish. Not sure if the aglonotti were made upon order or just because it was a holiday. Either way, we understood it was jam packed and just enjoyed the atmosphere. The vibe is lively and fun, definitely a Brooklyn experience.",

The staff are super lovely and helpful, and our food arrived quickly and beautifully served. The chicken liver mousse was fantastic with the blood orange marmellata, and the crispy bread-like thing on the side was also great. My husband had the Italian pork sandwich which he loved, I chose the Egg benedetto which sadly was only okay- I\u2019ve eaten way better ones in other restaurants before. (Oh and the Home Fries were also great- very spicy though!) However, I would truly recommend the place as the atmosphere was nice, the staff are great and the food is good (just skip the eggs benedict:)).",

Rents drove him to Brooklyn. We have followed. We uber from Manhattan. They have a wood burning oven for pizza and foccacina. Great appetizers and main courses. We are so happy that Chef Al found a space with better rent even though it is in another borough. Also the drinks and wine list is good and i love the cannollo for dessert.",

My wife and I come to Barano once a month. It\u2019s located in Brooklyn and it\u2019s easy to reach. The cuisine has no equal in NYC and it\u2019s our favorite place. You can taste what I would call a modern Italian cuisine as the chef is able to combine traditional Italian dishes with modern, tasteful tricks that make it special. We love their pizza: thin crust with zucchini flowers (I\u2019m sure this is a seasonal dish). Also try the smoked mozzarella with tomatoes and other vegetables. The staff is very nice and is able to suggest the best wine given your meals. They really know about wines so feel free to ask any kind of questions. I had the chance to talk to the chef once (I forgot the name! Pardon!) as I was interested in knowing his background. And that\u2019s when I found out he is an Italian American whose grandparents came straight to Brooklyn from Barano, this lovely neighborhood in Ischia. It\u2019s a must-go location. Enjoy!",

I didn't get the bartender's name, but he was incredibly kind and knowledgeable. My wine knowledge = I like white.  So thankful for Jason, who helped me out with beers and wine, talk about knowledgeable! His passion for drinking is palpable and I appreciate his level of commitment. He mentioned the wine list is always rotating small batches of delicious wines. Also, overheard someone say the cocktails are Beastie Boys-themed! The food, my god, the food! The scallops are to DIE FOR, I was nearly moved to tears! The pasta, one has wild boar, another is red, a little spicy with hints of honey \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 SO GOOD. Also, the veggies!! Whether you get them grilled or pickled (on the side of the delicious fresh mozzarella cheese and prosciutto), they know how to make vegetables absolutely devine. And fried cheese balls! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",

The meatballs are delicious, as are the pasta dishes. The much-hyped pizza, however, is no better than okay. There are many better pizzas in town (Marta, Posto, Arturo's, Juliana's) and these need serious improvement if they are to continue being such a major component of the dinner menu. The mozzarella choices are a bit precious but also delicious. The stracciatella came in a bowl, which proved very awkward for serving (just put it on a plate, please). Wines were good, as were coffees and desserts, and our waitress was professional and courteous. I probably won't return, but I enjoyed my meal here. Skip the pizza if you go.",

The atmosphere is nice and it's a really nice setting - that gets it the extra star. Unfortunately, everything else is pretty dire: the food - our party of four ordered a pesto pasta dish, an octupus pasta and assorted starters. In all three cases the food was seriously average and certainly not worth $20 a dish. The octopus in particularly tasted like a tinned tomato and frozen calamari that you could get for about $5. As other people have said, with some of the other food they were trying adventurous stuff and using lots of abstruse Italian words on the menu to justify charging more for the dishes. (incidentally, truffle pasta for $70 anyone? It costs half to a quarter of that all over town). The service was even worse. We got as waitor some guy who looks like Kelly Jones from the Stereophonics. He looked surly all night until we were about to leave when he of course suddenly became fawning. When he brought that bill, we thought we had been overcharged. To be precise - the menu was poorly written: it says \"Antipasto tasting - Mozzarella + Salume + Verdure 25, with Mangalica +5\". This apparently means that you can SUBSTITUTE the salume for the mangalica by paying $5 more. This was very unclear and we explained this but Kelly Jones insisted that he had explained this and that we were too dim to understand. His manner was very rude and abrasive. Service - bad; food - bad. Why bother going here?",

I wouldn't necessarily call this a romantic spot- the table set up is weird and not very intimate. The few booths they have are saved for large parties. The mozzarella was extremely impressive - you basically can't go wrong with the tasting menu. I found the appetizers to be a bit odd and disappointing , especially following such a great appetizer. The pasta was unremarkable and I would not order it again. Meatballs were good, kale was odd, and the octopus was under seasoned. I'd come back but only for wine and cheese.",
