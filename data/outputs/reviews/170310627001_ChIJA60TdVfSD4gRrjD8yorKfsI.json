        "caption": "Are you and your family/friends looking for a good Chicago style deep dish pizza, but someone is gluten intolerant? Look no further than Chicago's Pizza.  My boyfriend is very gluten sensitive and, while I actually like cauliflower crust pizza, sometimes I have a real craving for that carpet bomb of cheese and marinara called the Chicago deep dish. However, if we go to a pizza place that has a \"gluten free pizza\", what my boyfriend receives is almost always this sad little personal pizza that looks pathetic next to the heaping mass of calories and happiness that is my full size real deep dish.  This all changed when we discovered Chicago's Pizza.  I was almost skeptical when I saw that their gluten free deep dish comes in multiple sizes right alongside the regular pizza. On their website it states that they have been perfecting their gluten free crust for many years and that it tastes almost identical to their regular pies. We decided to put that to the test.  I ordered a large 14\" pie for myself and a 14\" pie for him and we went to go pick it up. This was during the height of the 2020 pandemic so we were not able to enjoy the restaurant itself, but it was very nicely decorated and the cashier was very polite.  When we got the pizzas home, I noticed that my boyfriends pizza was placed inside of a special green pizza box with \"GLUTEN FREE\" on the top. This turned out to be very necessary because the two pies looked and smelled absolutely identical. Heaps of cheese, crust and marinara.  After slicing into my own pie, my boyfriend offered me part of the crust from his and I can honestly say that there was absolutely no difference between the two. The gluten free crust was just as flaky and buttery as the regular.  Keep in mind that there is a slight up-charge for the gluten free crust, but it is well worth it for the downtrodden, anti-gluten person in your group to enjoy a classic Chicago deep dish with you and not feel marginalized.  We will definitely be returning many times to Chicago's Pizza whenever we need to scratch that typical Chicagoan itch for our city's unique pie.",

When we went to the restaurant the waiter sat us down and asked if anyone was gluten free and promptly brought out gluten free garlic bread on the house (it was like eating garlic-y pillows of goodness). After a long internal debate I ordered a gluten free pepperoni deep dish. YALL THIS WAS SO GOOD. My mouth was watering, my heart was full of cheesy goodness, and I ate so much pizza that we had to walk home. My family said that the gluten free crust was just as good as the regular!  If I could give this restaurant 20 stars I would. Best service, best food, and I would travel from Texas back to Illinois for this pizza again.",

At an hour and a half we called and asked for the status of our pizza.  We were told it would be another 5 minutes.  We called back 20 minutes later wondering where our food was, and about that time the delivery guy finally showed up.  After going down to pick up our food (because they apparently don't deliver to the room), we get it back and the pizza hasn't been cut (there's an option when you order online to have it \"not cut\", we didn't select that though).  We've never had Chicago deep dish pizza and were excited to try it out... well we didn't have silverware either, so we literally tore this messy pizza and scooped up toppings with our hands.  All in all, the pizza was OK, but the service was kind of terrible.  1 hour 50 minute wait time, didn't even slice the pizza, no silverware.",

They brought me fresh, still warm GF bread sticks for the table. The Pizza it's self was amazing! Still GF but not nearly as dense as I thought it would be, being that it's Deep Dish. The gentleman who was taking care of me even allowed me to leave my pizza there in the fridge so I wouldnt have to carry it with me through Lincoln Park Zoo! Such a great experience and quality food.",

        "caption": "Our annual trip to Chicago involves an annual trip to a different Chicago style pizza place\u2026this year my wife\u2019s sensibility wanting gluten free options won out which brought us to Chicago\u2019s Pizza (The Lakeview location.) There are lots of gluten-free options including bread, calzones, pizza (of all depths) all made from their house-made gluten free-dough.  For gluten-full me I had two kinds of deep dish pizza to choose from\u2026One is their stuffed crust (\u201cwhat we\u2019re famous for\u201d our waiter said) which has an extra layer on the bottom with cheese in it. They also have a more traditional Chicago deep dish pizza and the crusts and sauces for both are different.  It was Memorial day Monday and we were the only people in the restaurant. They took good care of us.  I got their house extra crust/cheese pizza which very much looked like a traditional Chicago Deep Dish. The taste of the crust though wasn\u2019t the classic buttery crust you\u2019d get on the traditional deep dish\u2026more like thick bread which isn\u2019t usually what I\u2019m going for on pizza of any kind. The sauce was super good though!  My wife thought the gluten-free was satisfying for what it was, though it had been so long since she had had a deep dish pizza that she couldn\u2019t quite compare to the real thing. She did think the bottom of the crust in the middle was a little mushy but kudos to them for home making gluten-free dough and providing a legitimate experience to those with that diet, as opposed to so many restaurants that use frozen gluten-free dough.  The small pizzas, by the way, are actually quite large. It was way more than us little people could eat. (Especially getting 2, one gluten free and one regular.)  In the end I would have preferred the standard Deep Dish with the butter crust as that\u2019s really what Chicago is all about whereas the stuffed crust is a little gimmicky and doesn\u2019t offer anything special.",
