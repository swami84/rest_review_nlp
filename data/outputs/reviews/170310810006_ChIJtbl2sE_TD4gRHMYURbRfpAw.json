There was really not much we would change about our experience.  I think both my friend and I would agree that our very favorite parts of the meal were the octopus and the gelato. I had actually never had octopus before, and don't care much for seafood in general. That being said, I thought the flavor was really amazing and my friend said it was the best octopus he's ever had! We had three types of gelato while we were there: vanilla, chocolate, and lemon. The lemon made with freshly squeezed lemons. You could tell that there is a lot of work put into it.  The venue was also lovely, I enjoyed reading about the murals in the packet I received upon request. My friend and I had a nice time matching the description to the depiction of each historical figure.  One thing I really liked personally was that I noticed the waiter gave detailed explanations of the food to not only my table, but also surrounding tables. I was really happy to see that the service seemed consistently good.  Overall I was very impressed!",

Seemed odd to me that they couldn\u2019t locate a medium priced bottle of Italian wine on their wine list.  The food was great, no complaints there. We ordered a number of pastas and a couple mains for the table to share.  They really need to adjust something with how they are waiting on the tables and perhaps find happier waiters.

In addition, the service was impeccable--our Italian waiter was friendly, asked if anyone was gluten free before serving the complementary bread, and the food came out in a timely manner. On top of it all, they have a beautiful outdoor patio, and it was a bit chilly in the evening, so they brought a space heater out and put it perfectly next to our tavle. Quite the exquisite evening--would definitely recommend!",

The atmosphere was nice, though our server seemed very frazzled, despite the restaurant not being too busy (there were several open tables, though I don't know how tables are assigned to severs so they may not have been his empty tables). When I asked about a potential substitution (I am a vegetarian and there was meat in the sauce of one dish), our server instantly directed me to other dishes instead of checking to see if a substitution was possible. I ordered the spaghetti he suggested, despite that not being what I wanted. Unfortunately, I regretted that once it came out. The presentation was lacking compared to the salads my sister and her boyfriend ordered, and I had to request parmesan cheese because someone had forgotten to add it, according to our server. The more I had, the more I regretted going out; I easily could have made the same thing at home with Ragu or Prego. My sister's boyfriend ordered meatballs that were burnt on the outside and raw in the centre. When we explained our disappointment to the manager, he very generously compensated part of our meal, but at that point we just wanted to leave. The salads and drinks my sister and her boyfriend ordered were good. I don't know if someone was having a bad day in the kitchen or if something else was going on, but hopefully it's sorted out soon. I expected more from a Michelin recommended restaurant, and I'm saddened at how disappointed I was with this meal. It made my birthday a little worse. I hope if you go your experience is better than mine.",

I was shopping most of the afternoon and asked my husband to meet me at the restaurant (Dearborn Street). My hubby got there before me and was seated by the host (I think her name was Natalie) on the right wing of the restaurant which was dark and empty. When I got there about 20 mins later I asked for him at the front and they told me no one was there with the description I gave ( my husband is a black man 6 feet tall). So I decided to walk around and finally found him isolated by himself tucked away in a dark dingy corner where no one else was eating. The crazy thing was that he left wing was full of laughter, almost 10, 15 people dining.  I believe this was a case of discrimination. My husband was seated in an area where He was the only black man. Isolated. And removed from society. He was totally being hidden.  Great food and excellent drinks though! But the experience took me back 50 years almost reminded me of Rosa Parks. Sit at the back of the bus. Sit at the back of the restaurant. Treat your customers with equal rights to enjoy their dining experience with everyone else. The host was horrible. Our waitress was a lot better.",

The waiter seemed to constantly up sell us and later when we asked for two more glasses of wine he must've chosen the most expensive glasses on the list. The food was mediocre for the price. Pork chop was dry flavorless. We expected something thick juicy. to accommodate they offered a side on the house. Again nothing great. It was not the meal I was expecting. The only great thing was the ambiance THAT was incredible. I love the mood and feel. Very romantic. We had the best spot in the house. Saved the evening.",
