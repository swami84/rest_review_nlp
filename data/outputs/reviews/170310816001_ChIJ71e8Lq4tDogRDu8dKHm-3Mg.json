The host and our waiter checked on us often and made sure we were well taken care of.

We ordered the pan con tomate - classic, toasted goat cheese, local mirai sweet corn, patatas bravas xl fries, garlic shrimp, lapryor farms beef burger and butifarra spanish sausage.  Everything was just fantastic and my friends even ordered a second order of the toasted goat cheese.  Our server Kristina was great and very friendly - we told her it was our first time in Chicago and she spent some time chatting with us about our trip and the things we had done.  Shortly after, the manager, Alex, came over and said he had heard it was our first visit and he brought us the blistered shishito peppers on the house as a welcome (they were awesome and it was a much appreciated surprise!).  We also ordered the green beans but they were out, so Alex offered to give us another dish and suggested the shaved brussels, which he also said would be on the house.  We were blown away by the fantastic service and the great food - it was easily our best meal out of our 5 days in Chicago.  The restaurant is also very cozy and stylish and has a great ambiance.  Thanks Bar Ramone!",

I also find it to be WAY overpriced for what you actually get. My wife and I had two glasses of wine apiece and the meat and cheese platter (which was great but small) and our bill sat around $125.

Somehow this small wine bar worked equally well for a quiet catch up for two and a great night out for a (not so quiet) group of friends. The service is excellent - the servers were ready with great recommendations for food and wine (if you ask). Sadly after a few attempts, I have yet to master the art of the porron (the magical vessel meant for pouring wine directly into your mouth). At least this gives me another excuse to visit again!",
