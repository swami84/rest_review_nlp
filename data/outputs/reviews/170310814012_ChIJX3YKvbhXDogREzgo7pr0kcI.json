She said oh I\u2019ll get more and I said no thank you. Two minutes later a gentleman slammed water on my table stating here is your water. I should have followed my first mind to exit however, because I live in the building I wanted to give it a try in the event I could dine there out of convenience. Unfortunately, that will never happen. Here\u2019s why: My food arrived and the rude waitress asked if I wanted anything else. Well I asked for skim milk and received whole milk however, based on her response to the bug in my water I made no effort to exchange for skim milk. Finally, I asked for butter and syrup for my pancakes. I received butter and syrup which I promptly put on my pancakes. Noting a strange taste, I realized the waitress had given me a bottle of sugar free syrup. When I asked if they had regular syrup she seemed quite confused. At this point it was strike 3, I asked for the check, paid it quickly and decided never to grace the doors of Eggs Inc. ever again even though I can roll out of bed and be there in 2 minutes. What a waste of time and money since I departed and left my entire meal uneaten on the table.",

I was trying something new as I have had the European Croissant sandwich and soup which was absolutely wonderful in the past. I have definitely had better tuna for half the price. I'm trying to tell myself it must be a bad day or off day for the cook in order to consume it. I have dressed it with mustard, salt and pepper and it still leaves alot to be desired, even the pickle wasn't crisp and appeared old. What saved the day was the  cup of clam chowder and fruit that accompanied the sandwich and my overpriced $4 order of french fries. It's not about the price being that it is relatively considered a good value for the area",

I get my food & take an Uber back to the office; super excited to try out the salad as it looked like it would be yummy based on the menu & aside from starving. I get to the office, opened up my meal & was completely disappointed as it was nothing like what it read on the menu. The salad didn't have mandarins or strawberries, it had blue cheese (which I don't eat), dried cranberries & it also had tomato which I don't mind but it was not on the menu. I paid $15 (because I added chicken for a salad I couldn't eat since it had crumbled blue cheese all over. It's not like I could take it off. I'm also left without lunch or food so now I have to wait till 5pm when I get off work to eat food & for a pregnant person with twins it's a lot to handle.",

Back home, in the Toronto area, breakfast restaurants never offer fresh fruit as a side option so the fact that Eggs Inc does is a huge plus! 5 starts Eggs Inc. keep up the good work. Highly recommend coming here for a huge variety of breakfast and lunch options!",

I continued to place the order because I figured the food might make up for the person's personal issues and sometimes it's not about you start it's how you finish. When I went to pick the food up, she was still rude.  When I opened my food, I found almost raw/uncooked hash browns, the blueberry pancakes were under cooked and very mushy. The pancakes tasted worse than Bisquick pancakes. I will say the omelette looked good so I started eating it. When I got towards the middle, there was a piece of a rubber band in my omelette. At this point I had to call the manager. When I called, the same host answered the phone and said the manager was busy and would call back. Because The manager never called back, I had to call again. The manager said he would look into it but never called me back. Food was below average and the service was not good.",
