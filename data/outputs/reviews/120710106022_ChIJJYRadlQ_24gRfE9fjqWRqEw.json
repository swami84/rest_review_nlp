Joel decided that it wasn't worth it to bring in his kitchen staff on Sunday after selling the shows as \"dinner and a show\u201d. We ended up spending hundreds of dollars and asking multiple people to help us prepare food to give the people what was advertised. While talking to Joel personally and professionally to discuss the fact that he not only let us down by refusing to call in his staff to hold up to his agreement, but he also basically doubled the amount of money that was agreed upon and openly told me that he's never going to have us do shows there again. We didn't ever really get to discuss how he was being unethical when he threatened to call the cops on me, twice. I stepped down and packed up and left. I've played at this venue multiple times and have heard many bad experiences about how Joel runs his business. All I'm asking is that you don't support his bad business decisions. And please spread the word. Joel has been doing this for years and it's time that someone calls him out on it. Anyone who really knows me knows that I'm not usually confrontational, but this has gone too far and I'm tired of people being selfish instead of doing what's right.  Updated 1/11/21 after Joel's response: Joel, thank you for taking the time to share your side of the story. If it was this cut and dry, why didn't you have this conversation with me yesterday? Why did you threaten to call the cops multiple times. I was not being loud with you, I was simply trying to have this conversation with you but you wouldn't have it.",

I noticed on Facebook that cape cabaret was having a journey cover band and after listening to their video I thought it would be a good time and they sounded just like journey. We were told to arrive around 6:00 if we wanted to have dinner and that would give us plenty of time before the show started. We got there right at 6:00 and we're promptly seated and our waitress took our drink order and let us look over the hard cover menu which seemed to have a gourmet touch and a gourmet price.So after reviewing the menu we both picked the chicken parmesan and after about 10 minutes or so our waitress came back and said I have bad news there is only one chicken parmesan left. So I told my wife you take the chicken parmesan and I order the pot roast and after another 10 minutes went by our waitress came back to the table and said I have more bad news there is no pot roast left. About now I am starting to get annoyed and hungry and the show was getting ready to start. So my wife said you take the chicken parm and I will order the coconut shrimp. Well guess what they're out of coconut shrimp also so the waitress says how about a pretzel. Long story short we decided to split the one chicken parm that was left. After waiting for what seemed an eternity we finally got our chicken parm and it was not very good at all, very salty not much sauce and very little chicken. The waitress told us due to having so many issues tonight she was going to Comp US some garlic bread so between the two of us we got three tiny little cold pieces of garlic bread. I'm not sure why they didn't have any food left at 6:00 p.m. on a show night but I can tell you one thing I would never go back there for dinner and I would have to think twice about going to see another show. The band was great don't get me wrong but the acoustics were bad and the meal was really bad making our date night one that we shall not soon forget.",

Servers did a real good job - they work hard. The 3 shows were all very different - Journey/Bon Jovi tribute show was great and the band members were extremely talented.  Second show was a Motown Review using recorded instrumentals - no live band.  Singers were excellent and we had fun dancing to their tunes.  The Eagles tribute band had everything... talent, personalities, first-rate vocals, and was the most fun evening of the 3 shows for us.  They got everyone out there dancing and having fun.  I realize their music lends itself more to having an all-out fun dance party, which it certainly was.  Kind of unfortunate, at end of evening the band wanted to do just one more, but management decided to turn on the lights and they could not be talked into turning them back off - even by the band.  Kind of ended the night with a \"thud\".  But anyway we sure had a great time and overall Cape Cabaret staff really works hard and does an excellent job entertaining their guests.",

The event was to celebrate a group of graduating high school seniors and we were playing a slideshow for friends and family. When we started the video I turned down the lights so everyone could see the screen. Upon turning down the lights the owner came unglued and instead of being professional & politely explaining that he did not want the lights turned down due to a liability concern he instead started scolding people. Followed by that with about 5 minutes left in the video and after spending thousands of dollars for the special occasion he turned on the lights and said we would have to leave our time was up. I have never been as disappointed with an owner in my life. I personally will never step foot in this establishment for any event again and would strongly advise using this venue for any private event.

There are many other places nearby that are worth a look. I know it is not easy running a place like this, especially with the competition you face, but if you're going to do it, do it right and stop whining about anyone who doesn't give you 4or5 stars. I've been there twice and you are 0 for 2, how can I recommend this place?  How can I bring my guests here when you don't know what you are going to get? Honestly, your location will be the downfall, to try to have a top notch dinner club on a back street in a small town? There's not enough money around to support it.

The mixed drinks are watered down. The waitress service was terrible. We saw our assigned waitress twice during the entire night even though our water glasses remained empty for a long while.  We had to flag down another waitress to bring our check. That particular waitress apologized both for the poor service and for the waitress that we had for our table.

My only complaint and I own a restaurant so I can say this honestly,  the food is horrible! The funniest part is the waitress said several times that the Chef is fabulous.  The chicken parm tasted as it had been previously frozen and the sauce was canned.  With the amazing service and entertainment this place would be a 5 star must go to every night. Will be back, however we will eat somewhere else first!",

They called us back around  2 pm  to confirm our  reservation for 5:00 pm.  They stated it come early because there was a show.  Upon arrival we get seated and get tended to very well.  The place is half empty.  We  are a party of four.  We order appetizers and drinks  and we wait.........  6:30 pm rolls around and we are getting our main course wondering when the show is going to start........  We finish our meal and order dessert .... we get it and finish that,  still no show.  We ask for the bill and we pay it. 7:20 pm  show starts,  we are told that is we stay we are going to be charged to watch the show.  We got up and left.  What a waste of time!!!!",

What a huge responsibility that you clearly took on with such accountability. I have never seen a business , let  alone the owner himself, to take the time to see what their customers are saying and respond with such respect.

We were told the bar was backed up! We had to ask for menus but no one came back to take our order!  When we finally got our severs attention she said it was too late to place an order! We didn't know you stopped taking orders so early!  We should have been told by someone! Your own website said no Cover Charge this evening but we were charged one anyway!  This place has great potential but does not have their act together!  It felt like it was the first time this place was open and no one knew what to do!",

They then told us \"too bad we have a party of over 200 guests in the next room\", seriously?! That's unacceptable, the manager proceeded to yell at my poor mother who was trying to simply explain to the manager the situation to which he then replied \"well if you don't like it don't come back!\" I have never been to such a rude poorly run establishment in my life!!!",

The mixed drinks were very good, not watered down, and the wine was of the quality that no one had a headache the next day. We tried all the appetizers and every one was a winner. We also tried the nightly dinner special in the lounge and it was nicely presented and delicious. The lounge singer was well organized, flexible and very entertaining. Our intention was to have dinner in the large dining room where the entertainment is, but none of us cared for the band that was playing so we opted to eat in the lounge. Our waitress was exceptional in taking care of such a large group. We will definitely go back and next time will try dinner in the main dining room.",
