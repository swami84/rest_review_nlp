Despite the transient coming and going of pizza chains which catered to the demand brought on by the \"neapolitan renaissance \" that furiously saturated the DC restaurant, Pizzoli's has remained independent in one location for over 20 years.  Most closely comparable to Famous Luigi's, Pizzoli's has remained who they've been true to themselves and what they offer....consistent quality, classic style (I guess called NY style if you need some frame of reference) with eclectic options to choose.  Unfortunately Luigi's had to close it's doors in 2013, but still remains a legend with hard shoes to fill along with other local staples who's shoes no one will ever fit into again (Armand's Chicago Pizzeria).  Fortunately Pizzoli's had made it this far and I hope it doesn't suffer a similar fate but very likely for the reason it's so good.  It's definitely an establishment that isn't interested in corporate backing, looking to accommodate to trends or pander to budget friendly gimmicks.  Which might click with a handful of you readers out there, but they're like Four Seasons insofar as their quality is the cornerstone of how they treat each customer and pizza pie...equally great pizza, that's it, no rewards, no games, but most importantly, no doubt if you like it or not.  Pizza preferences are always highly subjective, Pizzoli's Pizzeria is worth challenging your palate.",

At first, when he charged me $15 for two slices with sausage, I thought, well, that's the \"we unlocked the door for you\" price.  However, when they came out with 2 pizza boxes stuffed full of the largest slices I've ever seen (each was a 1/4 X-Large pizza cut in fours) I realized we got a bargain. When we sat down to eat, we realized this was beyond ordinary pizza.  Thin, crispy crust, flavorful sauce, almost too much mozzarella and homemade italian sausage that blew us away.  We even had enough for lunch the next day. If you get a chance, go there!!",

When I got my order I was pleasantly surprised to see that what they call a slice was actually the size of 2 large slices. It was cut into 4 small wedges. Crust was crispy and didn\u2019t droop when held at the edges. The pizza sauce was zesty but deliciously so. Not your typical slice but still very enjoyable. Highly recommend.",

We were asked what our room number was on the phone so we assumed it would be delivered right to the room. The delivery driver then called later and said he was one minute away and we would need to meet him outside because it was against hotel policy for him to come in. This wouldn't be a problem normally, but our hotel is huge and for us to walk outside we could have just gone and got the food ourselves as it's just down the street. We were walking down to meet him when he called again to tell us where he was parked and I stated that we were on our way downstairs (long walk) then he hung up. The wrong sauce was delivered for our chicken fingers and the pizza was not very good. It had a strange sauce on it, sort of like salsa. Speed of service was very fast.",

The owner's name is Ghani and in our experience with him he was rude and unprofessional. Our office ordered pizzas that totaled over $58 and when we received them they were hard. They claim that it shouldn't have been hard because they haven't received \"any complaints\" and the oven is set to a standard temp. (No complaints, huh?!? I guess they haven't been reading these reviews) Anyway, the driver that took my order had the nerve not to listen to the number I gave him, write down a generic number off the caller ID, and then have an attitude that he wasn't getting an answer from the number he decided to call. To make matters worse, the owner called me and literally started yelling that his driver was in the lobby. I didn't know he was the owner at the time, but when I called back to speak to the manager to express my concern and to my surprise found out he was the owner, he apologized, but in my opinion, when it comes to customer service that is not how you treat your customers.  He was unprofessional and didn't want to correct our order after we had to call back to let them know about our issues. Our offices will NEVER contact this company again! Terrible Service! Don't order from them - you will regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The moment came where I ordered a pizza and they messed up an ingredient, and when I tried to bring it to their attention they were extremely rude about it and how I should bring it back so they can fix their mistake. No ownership was taken and I expected more if I was willing to pay a ridiculous amount for a medium pizza. Good luck and I hope they get your order correct.",

It also doesn't state on their menu that this pizza is prepared with hot peppers.  Anyway they wouldn't refund my money, and I think that's bad customer service!

A little bit higher than ordering from Dominos or Papa Johns, but then again you get a much better product I believe.  I order online and within 15 minutes it's ready - very quick and good.  Pizza sauce is mild but flavorful.  They offer other things as well beyond pizza; appetizers, sandwiches, salads, a few deserts and drinks.  Again, not really a sit down place however.",

        "caption": "moved to the neighborhood recently, and closest pizza joint. went there several times, as the owner was nice and would always rave about how the ingredients were fresh and the pizza was the best we would find. quickly realized it was just not very good. went in tonight for a jumbo cheese slice of pizza. cashier was hitting on a drunk girl as i walked in, and took probably ~15 seconds to acknowledge me. put the order in, and he went back to hitting on her (i was the only other person inside). she walked out once she got her pizza, and he commented to me on how he \"had no chance\" with her. flash forward to the ~7 minutes to me getting my pizza. walk back to my house, open it, and see half the crust is ripped off (picture uploaded on yelp). i call them, and am immediately put on hold (understandable, late night). when he picks up, i tell him that half my crust is ripped off and he asks if i want to order another slice. i tell him again, and after a failure to communicate i hang up in defeat and give up. they call back, and he asks me if i had a problem with the slice (I'm a little impressed with that). i tell him i am coming over, and walk back to the pizzolis. they already have another slice ready for me, and he half asses apologized for the mistake and seemed annoyed that i came back and was taking up his time. they blame it on the pizza getting caught in the oven, but you be the judge (picture uploaded on yelp). as soon as i had my hand on the box he went back to talking to his friends in the store. i threw out their replacement slice (for fear of \"waiting\" type things on the slice) and ordered papa johns.",

        "caption": "Man oh man is this place good!  My new favorite NY style pizza outside of Manhattan.  It's an unassuming little joint but there were few food options close to the Cambria hotel we stayed at on 9th and O.  It was a quick walk over to 12th.  Coming around the corner I smelled this incredible smell, and it wound up being Pizzoli's.  It's small on the inside but they have a patio and amazing food.  They also have a large drink selection, cakes, and a full case of Ben and Jerry's.  We had a vegetarian version of their spinach pie and it was crazy good.  The pie was a little small for what we normally get as a medium, but it was piled up with sun dried tomatoes, carmelized onions and spinach, I ate 6 slices.  Crazy good pizza.  When we are back in DC we are eating here.",

When I came in I asked what type of slice I would get (new york, chicago, other) and the girl could not tell me. Worse, she didnt care and only proceeded to point and a black and white photocopy (small) pasted on the wall. I still ordered a slice with ham and they gave me a slice with ham just thrown on top of it at the last minute. To be quiet honest i walked away and threw most of it on the garbage.",

I like the hand-tossed crust for a slightly thicker pizza-- it's not as thick as Pizza Hut or Papa John's hand-tossed and that's just fine with me.  My only reservation is that the delivery can take a while and they've forgotten a drink a time or two. They've only made mistakes like that when it's basically right before they close so I try cut them a little slack. I think twice before ordering late or if I'm in hurry--- but I do think twice because it's pretty good.",
