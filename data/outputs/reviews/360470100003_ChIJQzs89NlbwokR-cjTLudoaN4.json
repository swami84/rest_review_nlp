Don\u2019t get the Japanese squid balls.  - Little pricey compared to fast food and compared to neighborhood. Called for delivery and no one picked up the phone. So super unreliable Once the lady behind the counter was arguing disturbingly with the delivery guy. I wanted to leave it was so uncomfortable.  This place does not know how to run a business. For variety in the neighborhood, I hope they shape up.  Go for the unique eats but don\u2019t expect much otherwise.",
