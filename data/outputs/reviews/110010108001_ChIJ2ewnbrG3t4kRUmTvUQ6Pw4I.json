For the price and selection it was lacking just because of the whole food immediately beside it.  The salad bar at whole foods provided the same options plus more.  The only reason for 3 stars is because of price and the tartness/taste of the beverages.  Each beverage was probably the worst tasting beverages I have ever consumed.  Not because of lacking in sugar or amount of tartness but just from taste alone.  I do hope for a better experience next time as I am still open and willing to eat at another location.",

I hope they consider bringing a store over to Columbus, where I assure you they'd be exceedingly popular...  They have so many great ingredients, and for relatively virgin salad-eaters like myself, they have some great recipes on the menu worth checking out, if you aren't sure how you'd like to build your own. We'll definitely consider coming back next time we're in DC, even among all the other awesome restaurants in the area.",

My friend, not knowing the menu, asked to make a substitution, and instead of someone explaining to her that it would cost more money or she could not, they yelled at her and patronized her until she was on the verge of tears, she eventually got to the front and they asked her if she wanted bread where she said no. They asked again saying \"you sure? you look like you want some bread,\" several times and she continued to say no. Even after saying no, they put it in anyway. As someone who has worked in food service, I have never seen such disregard for a customer. By the time we left, my friend was on the verge of tears and said she was actually scared to go to another sweetgreen. Needless to say, I have lost respect for this location.",

Perhaps the ingredients were fine and my taste buds were just \"off\" today.  However, I typically eat preservative-free, all-natural foods, so I've become pretty good at detecting when preservatives are included.  MOST of Sweet Green's food is great, but my advice: stay away from the shrimp.",
