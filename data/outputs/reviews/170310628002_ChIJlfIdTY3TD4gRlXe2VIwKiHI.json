The mushroom steamed buns are amazing & maybe it\u2019s five spice or some other spice,  but the sauce for those is so full of umami goodness! The pad Thai was soooo good too! I ordered it with the soy duck even though I remember not liking duck back when I ate meat, but I thought that since it\u2019s faux duck it would just be some generic vegan meat alternative, but it\u2019s not. It definitely reminds me of what I remember duck tasting like so I wasn\u2019t the hugest fan, but if you like duck, get it!  I won\u2019t deduct any stars because they upheld their promise of \u201cduck\u201d flavor & it\u2019s my fault for not getting tofu or veggies instead. I will definitely be ordering again to try other dishes since I had such a good experience with my first order.",

This \"I'm vegan & vegetarian\" opens up. I was skeptical at first because of how a Thai vegan place can take over the spot... But boy, I ordered their Pad Thai with soy chicken after my first bite, all the wonderful flavors was running around my mouth and my tummy was happy again. I will definitely be back for other dishes",

I saw this restaurant from FB page Taste of VEGAN Chicagoland and I didn't wait to go try out their food. I went in for lunch with a co-worker and we got avocado buns, Kee Mao noodles and fried rice. Chris (owner) took a very good care of us and explain how they use rice berry for fried rice, I've never heard of it before but I'm glad I gave it a try. Everything tasted great and the restaurant was nice and clean. Thank you Chris, we will be back!",
