Not one but both servers that worked during that shift helped us while serving almost 8 other parties so they\u2019re really pro at their job. The environment is dope not too big but definitely worth the experience. The beer cheese dip is wild! Can\u2019t wait to visit again sometime as it gets warmer. They said they\u2019ll have a more spread out brunch menu soon but the lunch/dinner is their forte for the moment. Surprisingly they didn\u2019t close because of Covid but for few minor issues outta their control other than that they are an elite ale house. If you want an awesome drink or bite most definitely try this spot. #SupportYourLocalBusinesses",
