Why ask about allergies and then ask if I'm ok with cross contamination? I've never experienced such careless attitude towards allergies when dining in Chicago The waitress also charged me twice.",

From the moment we met Savannah at the bar, she made amazing drinks for us all evening and could not have been more fun, knowledgeable and professional!  Her partner, Alexis, was excellent as well and as a team, they are second to none! Our server, Chloe, impressed us with her amazing knowledge of the menu as we had many questions about the food, drinks and the sake!  We would have guessed Chloe was with NoBu for years, but she informed us it was her 2nd day after her training cycle, she is a definite asset to NoBu to say the least!   We will be back and already making plans to bring some other friends along to enjoy the experience!  Thank you!",

I was originally going to order the shrimp tempura when he said there were \u201cspecials \u201d. When I think of specials I think of a deal right? So we\u2019re having the greatest time it\u2019s time to go and the bill is $600. Mins you were from a beautiful city Port Huron MI and are only there for two days as we both work very hard. I am attending Yale and my husband owns a roofing company. We were taken advantage of plain and simple and I\u2019m not sure why they chose us to do this to as were good Christian people. I spoke with a man claiming to be the general manager who said he would refund us $150 that day. He confirmed my email and credit card details. I\u2019ve received no refund or confirmation email of the refund. Had to leave a Message on 11/09/20 because there were \u201cno managers there\u201d yesterday. I just want what was promised to us. I wish this never happened because I loved it at first all the way up until the bill came. We literally had cocktails bbq sliders and two orders of lamb no sides. $600... hogwash! I\u2019ve emailed twice and hope this is rectified today. I\u2019ve spoken with my attorney and filed a report with Chicago police as well. Just because I\u2019m a PhD doesn\u2019t mean I order $600 dinners! We are frugal good Americans who work hard for our money and others!  Ebony Bankston PhD",

Would not have ever thought of getting that before but now wish we had gotten more of it",

The service has always been fantastic. The cocktails are very good. I will continue to keep going back to one of my favorite restaurants",

We had to talk to the manager several times to place our order as well get our food. She messed up our order and then argued and made excuses. The food was mediocre at best and very expensive.  To top off the meal she accused us of leaving her a $5 tip on a 400 dollar bill and confronted us about it. She was left a more the generous tip considering how poor the service was. She did not know how to reconcile the machine to see her true tip.  Needless to say, I will not be returning!",

Due to the highly anticipated opening, the month wait is understandable especially considering social distancing rules, they can't service everyone. But I can attest to the quality of cleanliness and their level 0f professionalism, they are doing their best. I can't wait to go back. Wish they took standing reservations... :p",

Our server was not knowledgeable about the food at all. We ordered food, and after we were halfway through he came by to ask if he told us the specials. He then stumbled his way through the specials, and we asked about food allergies (gluten) for certain items on the menu. He gave us to OK and we placed the order. When he returned he let us know he was mistaken and it did have gluten, then shared other items we could order instead. We place another order and when he comes back, he informs us AGAIN that it actually did contain gluten. So after spending 2/3 of our time waiting on confirmation of food allergens, we decided to end the meal early.  You\u2019d just expect a high end restaurant to have something like food allergens figured out.",
