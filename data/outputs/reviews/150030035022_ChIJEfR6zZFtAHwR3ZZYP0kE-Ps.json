The Karai Special at $25, serves enough for one person. It has a bit of mussels, clams, shrimps, corns, red potatoes and sausages. Cayenne has one \"fire\" rating is spicy enough for me.

It was my first time there and we typically go in with little or no expectations. The margarita was great. However, it seemed like most of the food was overcooked and over seasoned with salt or garlic salt.  We got miso clams to start. Then ordered the \"no mess\" shrimp with King crab with Karai sauce. We ended up dipping the meats into the miso sauce to get some salt off. It actually tasted really good afterwards.  Lastly, we ordered the lobster tail with butter garlic sauce. I haven't had lobster in years and was really excited to try it. However I was pretty disappointed.  Almost the whole lobster was rubbery and the sauce tasted like the karai sauce. Not sure if they made a mistake on the sauce or if all the sauces are similar.  I honestly wasn't going to leave more than 1 star but our server was super nice and never let our drinks run out. I can't say that we will be coming back here.",

        "caption": "GIRL'S CRAB NIGHT!  My Nieces and I have an annual(formerly bi-annual) crab night tradition dating back to 1994. It started with the  eldest niece of the 2. Many years later, of school, then college in California, marriage, a master's degree, 1, 2, then 3  children, plane rides home, shopping, visiting family, etc... you get an exhausted mommy & an older aunty. So recently, instead of the usual crab night at my house, we decided to endeavor to search for the best place that would prepare the crab & more for us. This year it was Karai Crab, sister eatery to The Willows.  The search is over! We found it! It is now our favorite crab place, & where we will return to for our \"Crab Nights\"! Safe to say favorite eatery period!  The staff is so warm & friendly, from Kalani the host that greeted us at the door & seated us in the absolute coolest place in the restaurant! Outside where the ambiance was perfect! Open air covered seating area designed to look like it was mounted to a double hull canoe, floating on the water with tranquil little water falls. He lingered a little while to listen to our \"Crab Night Tradition\" story. He also came back later to check on us, talk story a little & say goodbye when the front of the house was no longer hectic.  Daniel our waiter was very nice & knowledgeable, answering questions & offering suggestions, checking on us to see if we were ok, or needed anything. John is very sweet & made it fun for the kids, engaging them with a \"Who wants a surprise!?\" question. To which hands flew up waving with excited \"I dos!\" being called out. John took them on a little excursion to the soft serve ice cream machine at the buffet in their adjacent sister property \"The Willows\".  They got to choose from pineapple, raspberry, vanilla or vanilla swirled with either of the 2 fruit flavors, and he had no problem when one of them couldn't choose & let him have 2 choices.  Now, the FOOD!  OMG! THE FOOD!! We all ordered King Crab. Different sauces, but all mild. I asked for my butter garlic sauce to be on the side, as I'm enough of a klutz already & wanted to try to prevent personal injury, (which has happened more than once at our once homespun \"Crab Nights\"). Plus, sometimes I like a bite here and there with nothing else but a crab's natural flavor unadulterated tastiness! Works for me & cleaner hands to boot!  We also got various sides. Love love love the sweet potato fries! Crispy flavorful sweetness of an orange fleshed sweet potato, with a perfect salty goodness & just enough spicy heat. Also ordered French bread. Very yummy & nicely chewy. Even better once I dipped it in my garlic butter. The French fries were crinkle cut & crispy on the outside & soft & warm on the inside. If you are getting them for your kids though, you might want to ask them for salt only, as it does have a bit of heat which might be too much for kids unless they are accustomed to spicier than normal food.  Oh btw... us big kids also got to go get ourselves some ice cream. I too couldn't decide & got to get 2 cups of the 2 swirled flavors! NICE!  The food was excellent. The staff so so spot on with making everything so 'olu'olu (comfortable) that you can almost feel like it must be your birthday! It was the perfect night,  with my sweet precious nieces, meeting all of our hopes, dreams & expectations!",

        "caption": "Management and staff need to recognize when they are wrong. At the expense of our patience, My family of four ended up bailing after wasting thirty minutes of waiting due to their dismissive attitude and arrogant lack of service. These folks lied to us and deflected their mistakes onto us as they gave our reserved request to be seated outdoors to accommodate another party of five. If there is a response to My posting, the manager will be accurately combative, dismissive, arrogant and defensive because this is the behavior we received that night from him and his staff. We arrived twenty minutes prior to our reservation because upon booking telephone reservations with the manager, he explained how the kitchen has last call for all food and beverages@ 8:30 PM and he asked if I request indoor or outdoor seating. 8PM reserve for four, outdoor seating is what I request. When we arrive on 3/29@ 7:40PM, we didn't receive any of that preference. We waited thirty minutes to be seated in a cramped front room by the entrance as they just gave our outdoor seating away to a party of five. 8:10PM: As I asked the manager@ the host stand how long to be seated in outdoor area as originally requested, he states \"I took your reservation and you didn't request outdoor seating...\" So this guy took the time to explain to Me how his kitchen closes promptly@ 8:30PM with last call on all food and beverages yet he didn't ask for My seating preferences... Such Lies!!! I DID tell him I wanted outdoor seating for four guests when I booked the reservation. Your staff gave our table away and now you can't admit that!!! Don't blame Me for your business mistakes... His claim was incorrect because the telephone reserve process was exactly the same in Jan 2019 when I booked and dined with them then. The front dining room is very small and I would never request to sit there unless I was just a walk in. This is exactly why I book vs walking in to dine. I simply let him know that he was incorrect because when I spoke to him about reservations, I specifically request outdoor seating@ the time he set up My reservation. I refuse to entertain his combative attitude especially in front of My family and in front of other patrons dining in this small entrance. Your Crab is not worth the argument and the $200+ Without our additional tip, it would have cost us to enjoy four orders of Snow Crab, appetizers and beverages... The male host we initially checked in with upon arrival even informed his manager@ this time that we DID have outdoor reservations when he checked us in@ 7:40PM. Seeing as how they decided to steal our reservation time and give it away, then to disguise this act of operations as if it was My mistake is Wrong. I told the family were leaving. The manager stated the table would be ready in five but I declined on waiting based off the principle of the matter. My family was disappointed and hesitant to leave because they were hungry and because we waited so long to be seated but we all left anyways based off the abrasive attitude of the boss. We went back to our suite and ordered in room dining from the BeachHouse@ the Moana. That was an Excellent meal.",

The karai seasoning is what we went with, and it made this probably the best crab eating experience that I've had. We also had the garlic noodles, which were on point, as well some corn and bread to dip in the oil leftover from the crab.  Definitely want to come back, but it can be a little expensive based on the market price, and I'd reccomend calling ahead if that is something you're worried about; the crab will be worth the price regardless though, trust me.  Parking is available right across from the restaurant; the lot is called \"The Willows Parking\".",

You can choose add more seafood like more shrimps or crab legs and what kind of seasoning and how high the level of spiciness (*habanero level is pretty good spicy) or if you feel you can face the ghost pepper level, then do it. The side dishes like their garlic noodle and sauteed mushrooms are pretty good. But from all of that I LOVE their calamari!! I never like fried calamari because most of them are rubbery or too chewy and greasy BUT Karai Crab calamari is the BOMB! So fresh it's very tender and they're not greasy at all! I only eat Karai Crab's calamari, other places NAH! The customer service is always nice and on point. Too bad they're going to close the door since the partner restaurant, The Willow was already closed permanently. Their last open for business is until the end of February 2019. I hope they can find new location and reopen the restaurant. Wish Karai Crab all the best!",

The interior is small and simple, and the outdoor seating is good. It is like a bungalow terrace, so it feels like you are in Southeast Asia. It is not difficult to order because the server will explain the menu with pleasant and friendly manner and also tell you the price that is written on the face. Duncan Nice Crab was gone for about 7 o'clock in the evening, so it was soles out with a king crab and a seafood combo. And I ordered cheese bread that the staff recommended. I got a half-mature king crab full of plump. Combo is a few shrimp. Some mussel shells Several sausages Five potatoes Two pieces. There are two pieces of corn coming out, but it is better to add some more favorite side than combo. The recommended sauce is curry flavor. I ordered karai sauce for the review that the kara sauce is delicious and the spicy flavor of Cajun style is not bad. Cheese bread is not impressive. It is not bad to have the sauce together. It is depreciated against price. It's a local restaurant. Parking is in the form of a large open space in front of the restaurant.

For a better experience we should have gone to their parent resturant, The Willows. I've been there and it's has a great Hawaiian ambiance  and it's connected to the Karai. The wait help was great! We just didn't expect to be in a small white room with cafeteria style table seating and no ambiance whatever. Get the buffet next time at The Willows.",

We got the fried catfish and fries appetizer and the lobster with garlic butter and the karai sauce on the side to try it. We also got some corn and their French bread. And the pomegranate lemonade. (We were hungry). The catfish was great, we really liked it and would get it again. So was the lemonade. The corn was good; the bread a bit dry. The lobster was good too, but lobster, as it turned out, was a little disappointing to us as a food item. Maybe we need to try lobster elsewhere to really fall in love with it, but as it was, it was good but not a big deal and not worth getting--we liked the catfish better.  All in all, the food was pretty good (and unbeknownst to us included a free trip to a small dessert buffet, which wasn't much but came as a nice surprise), but nothing to brag about and nothing to really go back for. But we liked it. Where this place really shined was in its customer service, to be sure. We had walked from our hotel and it was late when we were finished, so the waiter called us an Uber to get us back to our hotel--and paid for it! That was totally unexpected and above and beyond. I'm not saying you should expect this, and I wouldn't go back expecting this again, but it was enough to really make an impression on us. Thank you again!!",

We all agreed that this was the best crab we have ever had -- from the quality to the preparation.  The staff was equally as wonderful. They made us feel at home, were very attentive without being intrusive, and had a special tasty surprise waiting for us after dinner. We will certainly be back in the very near future.",

I was expecting much out of a Cajun seafood place in Oahu but was blown away by the amazing flavors and friendly service!  Reservation: probably required based on yelp reviews. I called same day and was able to get a reservation. Pro tip would be to request a table outside because it shares  the beautiful grounds of The Willow next door. Dining outside makes you feel like you're in a different country.  Parking: super easy across the street. Seems like it may be valet sometimes but on the Thursday evening I went, it was free and self park.  Food: amazing garlic noodle and amazing karai special seasoning!! Every thing is good in the seasoning. Some people warned me that the habanero would be too spicy but it definitely was not! Good spice level that didnt leave your tongue numb. The restaurant allows you to self serve ice cream for dessert!!!! Some say that the Dole Whip can only be found in Disney world and Dole plantation BUT THAT'S not true because DOLE WHIP IS FOUND HERE and you can go wild serving yourself, as much as you need.  Service: such friendly people. Ohana!!!",

So glad we found and chose Karai Crab, their seafood tasted so fresh and I couldn't stop licking their karai special seasoning off my fingers *fingerlickingood* lol. The service was also on top of their game and made sure tourists from all over the world felt welcomed! I'll definitely be coming back to karai crab if I'm ever in Honolulu again. They have tables indoors and outdoors. We sat outdoors and it was a pretty setting for the evening, right by a pond. Also, garlic noodles are a must.",

There is also a free parking lot within a 2 minute walk. The place is seemingly small like most other Cajun sea food places on the island. The first thing I noticed was how clean this place was. I loved the cute and bubbly art on the walls. There are many options on the menu. I came for the snow crab but today I chose shrimp which happened to be a few bucks cheaper than what I would pay at some other places. The snow crab was $5 more than what I would normally pay at some of my favorite sea food places. I sort of regret not testing it out to see why its more expensive... I ordered shrimp and garlic noodles and a guava tea. I was delighted with my meal. The garlic noodles were delicious. I ordered lemon pepper shrimp and with medium spice. I didn't taste the lemon pepper at all but I was still very happy with my shrimp... The shrimp were huge and filling... I had a little trouble peeling the shrimp, the shell was sticking on.... I think this place may also offer a buffet... I was given a surprise at the end if my meal (free ice cream)... I took a walk on the unbeaten path, through a hidden oasis, to get pineapple ice cream... It was great! I'm going to bring my family here when they come to visit! It was a very unique. Next time I'll get the crab.",

Thanks Yelp for this amazing suggestion.  We decided to go with the Combo option and added a Snow Crab portion.  We also ordered the garlic noodles.  The noodles came out in advance of the seafood, and they were gobbled up quickly.  They were right at the edge of being too garlicky, but honestly, that's a hard line to cross in my opinion. The huge bowl with the combo seafood and a massive amount of crab almost caused the table to groan, but what a glorious sight. The husband ate the clams, mussels, shrimp and sausage in the bowl, while I focused mostly on the crab.  We're a perfect match in that regard. I usually prefer my crab simply boiled/steamed and served with drawn butter and lemon.  This night I decided to go with the house style and everything was delicious. The service was outstanding and I found it to be a great value for the price.",

We are pretty used to eating spicy food but on recommendation of the waiter we picked the Cayenne which was on the edge what we could take. Also don't be fooled by the outside of the accommodation, make a reservation including outdoor seating and you'll be seated in a beautiful garden.",

Customer service was really good.  Very friendly staff.  Patient and helpful  Food was good and the value was fair as well.  Similar to other crab places you order by ordering picking a seafood, a seasoning and then a spice level.  They have peeled or unpeeled shrimp, crawfish, clams, muscles, snow crab, king crab, dungeness crab, dungeness crab clusters, and non-seafood fried tofu for the veggies.  :)  They also have combos that come with all of the above plus corn on the cob and sausages.  You can also add on any of the crabs to the combo for an additional charge.  The seasonings are: Garlic Butter, Cajun, Karai Special (garlic butter and Cajun), Tropical Hawaiian, Lemon Pepper, Court Bouillon, Lemon Grass.  Spicy levels available are: Mild, Medium (Cayenne), Spicy (Habanero), Extra Spicy (Ghost Pepper).  I ordered the unpeeled shrimp with Karai Special seasoning in extra spicy.  It was really good.  We also had the combo with king crab in lemon pepper (spicy), prawn in garlic butter (mild), clams in garlic butter (extra spicy) and another combo with snowcrab legs in garlic butter (medium spicy).  We got sides of garlic noodles (those were good) and a couple orders of garlic bread, which was also really good.  The garlic bread was good on its own but it was great for mopping up the sauce too.  They had several other sides that looked tempting to try.  I'll definitely be back to try some of their other options.",
