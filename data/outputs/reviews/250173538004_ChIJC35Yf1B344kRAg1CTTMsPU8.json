The hostess was super friendly about it and made sure we were able to order a drink while we waited. We then had a mind blowing meal with the best service I think I have ever experienced. They have half-cocktails, which are excellent if you want to try more than one thing. The best one we tried was a dry bubbly cocktail that came with a rosemary spring. So tasty without being too sweet or too boozy. Our server gave us great recommendations--I think I had the halibut and my partner had a steak. Perfection!",

The cocktails offered to my wife and I by Rob Ficks were superb and his candor helped create a light atmosphere and make the night more enjoyable.  It was worth coming to and I will be returning.",

We were a table of four and our bill was $410 for dinner, dessert and 3 drinks. There is a set price per person ($69) and you get to order 3 things from the menu, dessert not included and if you want a specialty meat or lobster dish you have to add $15 to the already fixed price. On top of that they add 6% to your bill! 3% covid recovery fee and 3% kitchen admin fee. The price would have been okay if the food was impressive but I was a little bit disappointed specially with the salad and popcorn on top. Desserts were also not good on the new menu. We ordered the sorbets and the chocolate  mousse and they were just okay.",

We started with \u2018apertivis\u2019 - which were pre- dinner cocktails. We then had the cheese board & foie gras. We visited Paris just a few weeks ago and I have to say their foie gras was better than anything we had there. The cheese board was pretty large and should be split by more than 2 people. My wife got the bolognese which we would both recommend. I got the tagliatelle with oxtail which was ok. We could have definitely split 1 pasta.  This place is a must visit if you are in the area.",

The place is rather modest building from the outside. I drive by every day to work and never realized that it was a restaurant (*). But the inside! lovely, intimate, atmosphere that reminded my of some New York trendy place rather than Harvard Square's dull establishments. The service is just outstanding and so is the cuisine.  * A historic note on how restaurants came by. In the 1700s there were no restaurants in Europe. People cooked for themselves, while travellers were served a pot of something by the tavern owner that they shared at a long table. That for a flat price. Some cooked hearty chicken soups. Soon they discovered the chicken soup's roborating properties and called them \"restaurant\", which means it \"restores\" your health. That was in France. The taverns started advertising on boards in front of the establishment that they offer \"restaurant\". There is more to the story but in short this is how the name came by. I learned this from the great Hungarian chef Jozsef Vinko.",

We have a drink at the bar while we wait for our table and are seated next to the big windows. We also sat next to the fireplace which was broken at the time but once it was fixed, it would make it even more homey.  The three of us shared 2 appetizers (heirloom tomatoes and garlic toast, asparagus), 2 pastas (bucatini and lumache), and 1 meat (Branzino). The heirloom tomatoes were so simple but so fresh and delicious and you could smell the garlic on the toast immediately when it was placed on the table. The lumache had gochujang (Korean chili paste) in the bolognese which was different but delicious. The branzino was cooked perfectly.  The waiter also knew a lot about the Boston food scene so it was great chatting with him about it.  Wasn't the best Italian I've had in Boston but a very solid experience.",

We had the octopus special, the veal bruschetta, the lumache, the pork Milanese, and the sorbet trio. The pork was good enough to order twice. To drink, the Ichabod and the Argento. The thing that\u2019s really surprising about Pammy\u2019s is how consistently balanced the food and cocktails are, while packing in just the right intensity of flavor and texture.  The service is impeccable; in addition to being just available and present enough, the servers are never intrusive. The staff seem genuinely warm, personable, and knowledgeable about what they\u2019re serving. Further, they were very helpful in locating a dropped credit card and on the way out, I saw one of the staff rush to tell a couple headed out the door that one of them had left their phone on the table.  The atmosphere and the decor are really great too. The one thing I don\u2019t much like about Pammy\u2019s is the entryway, as it\u2019s easy to bump into other waiting customers, but as that\u2019s my one nit picked, I\u2019ll say that Pammy\u2019s is one the best places to eat and drink that I know.",

The menu featured on their website is outdated, but have no fear - anything you order at this restaurant will exceed any expectations you have. The first time I went I got the bucatini and the pork milanese. Both were absolutely delicious. I've been dreaming about the pork milanese for months and was looking forward to it for my most recent visit. Although it was not currently on the menu, I ordered their squid ink pasta and a special entree, which was a pork chop. Both were absolutely amazing. Not only is the food delicious here, but the service is also fantastic. From the minute you walk in until you leave, you are very well taken care of. Pammy's staff is always kind, knowledgeable, and on top of their \"A game.\" Thanks again for a great night!",

Their salad looks simple but my first bite on that greens with shaved mushroom and truffle dressing turned out to be surprisingly YUMMY! Next, fried soft-shell crab with avocado and cucumber side vinaigrette dressing. DELISH! Soft shell crab is in season now. Thus, get it while it still last! We ordered skate wing for entree and it was perfectly cooked. Skate wing has a kind of texture similar to crab and I love crabs!!! There are so many dishes on the menu we wanted to try. I\u2019m sure we will be back more often this summer!",

The food is unique and delicious, paired with a charming yet chic atmosphere to make it the perfect spot for a date or a small group dinner. Highly recommend the raw brussels, tuna tartare and bucatini. Their cocktails are also excellent, and they have an extensive wine list. I was lucky enough to walk into Pammy's with a friend around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday and get seated right away, but for anyone else thinking of going here, definitely make a reservation!",

It allowed for privacy and was perfect for us. We enjoyed our dinner. It is a very inventive menu. Many textures in the dishes we had. Loved he brussel sprouts salad. Very citrusy and tasty. The beet covered american unagi was nothing like a japanese unagi. The skate was delicious and the shrimp pasta was yummy. The room is welcoming, warm, loud and comfortable. Service by Nick was top notch. First visit...will not be our last. It is easier to get reservations for 2 guests since that is all they seat at the communal table.

Great menu that is small enough to digest but has enough options that you can\u2019t wait to come back.  Food: Presentation is beautiful but not at the sacrifice of flavor or texture. Every dish has an unexpected twist. Order the bruschetta - they serve it upside down with a piece of house made garlic rub rustic bread on a bed of dice tomatoes and mozzarella.  Drink: Interesting, funky wine list that carries classics as well as the unexpected, off the beaten path wines that you find yourself hunting for the next day. Wouldn\u2019t consider the restaurant a mixology destination but solid bar tending game.  Service: Staff is knowledgeable, professional and friendly. Team service environment. Expert on the menu and happy to engage over the food.",

Walked up without reservations on a Monday night, the hostess was very accommodating and got us seated in 15 minutes. Props for recommending the negronis on tap, which turned out to be some of the best I've ever had.  We skipped starters and went straight to the pasta and mains. We ordered the lumache in bolognese and gochujang - it was perfectly al dente, and the sauce combination was the right blend to give the dish a twist. The highlight of the night was the perfectly seared duck with fried rice and Tuscan kale. Not always a fan of duck, but this dish is a phenomenal exceptiin. Will be back here next time I'm in Boston.",

My only hesitation for my next visit is that I would avoid the bar as the bar woman gave me absolutely no attention and it was a struggle to get her attention.  Luckily the GM Lauren was fantastic and seeing my plight came over explained the dishes and took my order and more than made up for the slip up.  That said when it came to desert I decided to skip and as I was not enjoying the experience at the bar.  I will go back because I liked everything else about the place the decor, atmosphere and most importantly the food.",

As appetizers, we got the mixed greens and garlic toast with heirloom tomatoes. Both were excellent and scrumptious. As a main course, I got the spaghetti 2.3. The pasta itself was perfectly cooked and beautifully homemade. However, I found the sauce too sweet for my liking\u2014 less like tomato sauce and more like sweet pepper sauce. For dessert, we had the blueberry crostata. I wished there was more blueberry filling and less crust, but it was still very tasty (not as exceptional as the other food, however). Overall, I greatly enjoyed my experience at Pammy\u2019s and would definitely recommend it to others.",

We progressed to a couple of different cocktails (me the bitter yet balanced fernet-based cocktail \"fernettaboutit\" and her a classic negroni) before our primi.  The primo was an excellent spaghetti dish - the tomato flavors were mature and burst beautifully in your mouth alongside the fresh and perfectly al sentence pasta. For secondi, I had the chicken al mattone and she had the braised short rib. The chicken comes with a crispy skin, and a beautiful double reduced broth with the richness cut by the bitter and crispy endive. Just a splendid dish I'd go back for by itself. Her short rib was perfectly cooked and the jus went excellently with the polenta - rich, but not overwhelmingly so.  We accompanied the primi with a beautiful natural sparkling wine, the name of which I now forget, which had been recommended by the barman (Josh) who is incredibly knowledgeable and he made great pairing suggestions. A fantastic, memorable experience and we'd love to go back.  Pic is of the piadina. She took some others, but I forgot to grab the pics.",

The space is fun, the bar area gets busy, the service is great and the food is outstanding. It is a popular place, so I definitely recommend to make a reservation in advance. As far as the food and the drinks go - everything was on point. The cooking influence is Italian, but with a modern approach. Flavors are complex, the food is not overly heavy. This is most definitely not your chicken parm or spaghetti and meatballs place (there are enough of those already). We tried the Malfaldine and the Capalletti pastas (fresh made) and both were outstanding. If you have been to Giulia, expect this level of pasta preparation. The mushroom bruschetta was fantastic - super comforting and delicious. The Wagyu short rib steak was tender, juicy and delicious. Desserts were excellent as well. All in all - a great meal and the overall value (including prices, food, drinks, service, ambiance) is very high. Can't wait for the next time.",

The highlight of our first dinner here was a delicious, soft-as-butter, very well-marinated Wagyu Short Rib Steak ($32) with polenta, heirloom carrots, and tamarind honey. The Lumache (house made, shell-shaped) bolognese ($24) with Gochujang (Korean red chilli paste) was pretty good but, contrary to the opinion of a local heat-seeking-missile food critic, aka Devra First, did not \"steadily a reveal a gentle heat.\" That heat was there from the beginning and, to this eater, quite intense and too dominant. So, also contrary to Ms. First, the dish was lacking in the \"harmonious\" touch she found at Pammy's, and which I feel is indicative of cooking mastery.  If I were using Gochujang, I would add something like b\u00e9chamel to help create that balance.  Our desserts included an excellent, multi-textural Cocoa Nib Cake ($11) with a caramel budino; and an apple Crostata ($11) with creme fraiche ice cream that was pretty good, and nicely buttery, but was almost ruined by too-crisp apples.  A polished Negroni was well-balanced, and a Sicilian Nero D'Avola paired well with the Lumache and steak.  Flour is house-milled at Pammy's, and the pasta and bread were all the better for it.  BTW, on a minor note, although we had indicated that this was a special birthday celebration in our Open Table reservation, no acknowledgement was made by staff.  A 2% kitchen administration fee is added to the bill, a good mark for fairness.",

They were fairly full on a Monday night, so it seems to be working.  I heard great things so I came in, and the service and cocktails and food were really great. The pasta with broccoli rabe and the poached yolk was such a lovely mix of warm and comforting and tangy and flavorful from the broccoli and whatever the sauce was. My cocktail (the fantasma negroni) was undoubtedly a negroni but very different from your normal negroni, which Pammy's has on tap! A super cool little detail that I would be excited to try on a second visit, which I will inevitably be making. I also appreciate their location, a little bit out off the main drag of central square restaurants, but equally if not more deserving of a spot among those bigger and older names. A wonderful experience, can't wait to experience it again.",

The cuisine is incredible: melt-in-your mouth bread made with freshly house-milled flour, octopus so tender you won't recognize it as a cephalopod, and an amazing ricotta angnolotti set with a perfect balance of mushrooms and herbs. Desserts were equally impressive.  Don't come here expecting heaping platefuls of food, this is quality over quantity. Portions are not large, but aren't as small as some have been saying. Supplemented with the unbelievably delicious house bread, 2 people can happily fill up even splitting 2 apps and 1 entree. I think the \"$$\" price category has been throwing off some folks; this is should probably be in the \"$$$\" price category.",

Our server, Jen, was terrific. Busy as hell all evening she managed to remember names and kept a running, relaxed conversation throughout. We let her choose wines for us and she did not disappoint. Really good , interesting, and different wines by the glass.  The food was fabulous. We started with the octopus and artichokes hearts with boquerones. Both were delicious! Based on a review here claiming small pasta portions we ordered two. the fusili with clams and the agnolottti with mushrooms. Both portions were substantial and delicious! It is true that there are ten pieces in the agnolotti dish but it's stuffed pasta for goodness sake! How many ravioli does one get in a normal serving? There were many many more than ten noodles in the fusili dish.  Unfortunately we had no room for dessert. We left full, satisfied, and with smiles on our faces. The excellent meal with three glasses of wine each cost $120 including a 25% tip. Excellent value for such a good meal.  We will be back!  Go to Pammy's before reservations are hard to come by!",

        "caption": "Let me start by saying I have been looking forward to going to this restaurant for a long time, as I live in the neighborhood and anxiously peered into the window while walking by over the past few months. When my girlfriend and I found out that it had finally announced a soft opening, we were in! Without knowing anything about the menu, we had no idea what to expect during our experience.  The atmosphere in the bar/dining area is great. The brown leather, frosted glass globe sconces, and gold accents give off a cool, 1920's vibe that works for a great date spot or a classy place to meet up with friends.  After sitting down at a stylish, rounded booth table, we decided to go with glasses of wine. I went with a regional glass of white from Maine, and it was fantastic. Who knew Maine was a wine hotspot? We then proceeded to order 2 appetizers. The Heirloom tomatoes and the octopus. Both were absolutely perfect! I've seriously never had octopus that was cooked that well. Literally melt in your mouth texture. The tomato dish (paired with a piece of garlic bread) was certainly memorable as well. After ordering 2 appetizers, we took a look at the menu and decided that we would both be full after splitting a pasta dish, after all it was $26 and we would be getting desserts to top everything off. The pasta arrived (super fast might I add, service was fantastic) and my girlfriend and I took a look at it and wondered where the rest of it went. Seriously there were 10 noodles (we know because we each had 5 and could count them on one hand). The pasta was great, but it left us both hungry and we had already spent $80.  To finish the meal off, we were going to order a dessert, but they were $11 each and also not filling (judging by the items ordered at the table next to us), so we decided to call it a night and grab some dessert at a great bakery down the street.  Atmosphere 5/5 Service 5/5 Food 4/5 Value 1/5  Overall, it pains me to say that we will not be going back anytime soon unless they decide to increase their portion sizes or lower their price point. It's hard to leave feeling satisfied after spending $100, and think about grabbing takeout Chinese from the place next door to satisfy your rumbling stomach. If you are celebrating a special occasion and don't mind spending $60 per guest, then I would highly recommend this. Otherwise, I would recommend Waypoint (right down the street) or Giulia (make a reservation 3 weeks in advance) for a better value.",
