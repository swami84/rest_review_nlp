Upon first look at the restaurant, there's a lot of printed images of food along with captions under it trying to explain what it is. To anyone new to Indian food, I think that a good testing dish to go with is any kind of Biryani. It's basically a stirfry of the protein, rice, and spices together.  Service for this restaurant felt pretty slow. There wasn't anyone else waiting on their dish, but it was getting close to rush hour again. I'm not sure if it was because I chose lamb that they decided to cook all the gaminess away from it, or it was choosing the right amount of chili oil, but I was getting pretty impatient.  The food was amazing. I was coughing up a fit with all the chili oil in the rice and lamb, but once I gave the green chutney a try with the lamb, the dish meshed perfectly. Between the random plum(?) seeds and some other inedible spices, I can't wait to come back to try out more Indian food. I think I might even try out their Paneer Makhani next.",

Even at the more ego centric sit down Indian restaurants I can get a dish, a piece of naan and a drink for about $11. I might be a lifelong Midwesterner but I'd bet when it comes to Indian cuisine I happen to tease the tandoori on occasion... So with that knowledge , Let's play a game, let's see how much you are raping your customers with your ridiculous prices..... So we'll itemize...and I'm making a batch that feeds 4, and I'm being very liberal with the prices ... 4 potatoes (70 cents) 1 head of cauliflower (1.99) 2 tomatoes (40 cents) 1 onion (80) 3 tablespoons of oil (35 cents) 1 pinch of cumin seeds (15 cents) 2 tablespoons of coriander (25 cents) 2 tablespoons of cumin (25 cents) 2 tablespoons of chili powder (25 cents) 1 tablespoon of turmeric (15 cents) 1 tablespoon amchur powder (10 cents) Salt (5 cents) Enough cilantro to garnish ( 50 cents) Cup of rice (1.25) That comes out to 7.64... 7.64 for a batch of aloo gobi that will feed 4 people. Divide that up and you get $1.91!! So if I go to the store and buy the ingredients at retail price , each bowl that you sell costs 1.91 to make! WITH THE RICE!!! And you charge me $15.99???? Terrible!!!! According to most of of your reviews the food isn't even that good. So what's the deal? What a joke.. I'm sure you get plenty of ignorant walk ups who think they're getting something exotic, but they're just a few YouTube videos away from learning to cook much better than the food your so called restaurant serves.",
