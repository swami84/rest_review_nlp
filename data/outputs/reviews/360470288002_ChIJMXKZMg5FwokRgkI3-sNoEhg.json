The stone mill one is the smoothest one according to the people working there. Steam and fabric steam I don't remember but one of them is thick.  I always order the cilantro with eggs and watercress. I tried the curry balls with noodle rolls and it was not bad. Get all the sauce except spicy.",

Why would they take hours just to make your food? It's quick and simple that's why i like it. But theres some negative things, too. For example the pirice. It's 4 bucks just for 5 chicken wings i can make at home. And that's it. My parents paid for me so i didn't care lol. Im gonna give it 5 stars cuz I'm quirky. Thanks",

Street cart food is even better and cheaper.  Lines were long and the wait was even longer, I am assuming these are first timers making the line long (since it just recently opened), guarantee they will not be back.  For 86th street there are better food options at cheaper prices.  For a place that specializes in rice noodle roll, giving this two thumbs down.  Didnt even eat the food, threw it out.",

The sauce is really watered down and tasteless. They say no tip required but they still have a tip jar and it appears to already be built into the prices. Prices in menu also do not include the tax. Do not recommend. There are better and cheaper options in the area.",
