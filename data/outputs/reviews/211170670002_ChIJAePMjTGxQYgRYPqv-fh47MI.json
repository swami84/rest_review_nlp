Beer was cold and tasty, hot sandwiches were equally good, and there's a fun and funky room in the back with old arcade games. Only downer was that the next morning, the jacket I had worn in there smelled like I'd dipped it in the fryer, even though I hadn't noticed a hot-oil smell while we were in there. So check it out, but make sure you can wash what you wear there.",

We had to ask for them. And then she got 2 out 3 wrong.I had to get up and get straws myself because once again she did not do her job and give them to us. Then waited over another 30 mins before taking order, even though she had to pass our table every time to the bar or kitchen. It took SO LONG for the food to come. Our order was 2 burgers and 1 pizza. We got the burgers fine but the wrong pizza. And instead of going back to the kitchen to get fixed she got drinks. SO at this point I have a child with NO food and had to find ways to keep a 3 year old entertained. Got there at 6:07 and it was now 7:23. So I asked to speak to the manager. The server came back and told me, NO she's busy. EXCUSE me???? So I demanded to speak to the manager again and the server wanted to argue with me the customer. She finally went and got the manager. The manager came out and after explaining all the bad things and the time we been there, she thinks that telling me being short staffed and was trying her best was going to be enough. AH, no. NOT my problem you are not staffed, not my problem your server sucks, not my problem you can't manage. Then I had to ask how she was going to fix this instead of HER doing the manager thing and saying I am so sorry I will go get your pizza right now and we will cover the bill since we screwed up on many things. Thanks for ruining my night and dinner!  SO here is what does not make sense. They have a game room. But NO kids menu, or coloring sheet or crayons for them at the tables. Also the games take quarters but the change machine did not work.  DO NOT go with kids, or don't have over 2 hours to wait for 2 burgers and 1 small pizza. DO NOT go if you would like a normal decent service. JUST DON\"T WASTE YOUR TIME.",

        "caption": "Very disappointed that this place is not kid friendly. I literally walked in and turned around and walked straight out. They only had a bar and high top tables. If you\u2019re going to advertise that you are a restaurant,, I would at least put in some regular tables or booth. Very disappointed...  Response to the owner - First and foremost \"your bartender\" was not that savvy and/or nice.  She mentioned the picnic tables, but it was raining.  We stood there long enough for her to tell us more, but she didn't seem to have an interest for us. Most likely why you only had a party of four in your building.  Our child is 2 years old so he no longer sits in a high chair, but not big enough to sit on a bar stool.  Your place is not deemed kid friendly because I can eat outside.  What would you suggest when this was in the middle of winter? Would you like my family to sit outside in the freezing cold, so you can still have a kid friendly restaurant?  We live by tavern on the bend in Cincinnati, and thought the restaurant was set up like that but we were largely mistaken.  Hofbrauhaus worked out better for dinner that night and tavern on the bend will be our burger place until you get a nicer staff and you actually make yourself \"kid friendly\"",
