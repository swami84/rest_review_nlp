We were in line to board the boat after purchasing tickets online a week ago when staff tell us that the boat broke and would not be sailing. They didn't email or call us to tell us but instead they waited until we were ready to board.  They refused to compensate us for our ferry fee and they gave me a hard time about refunding us for the steamboat cruise even though it was their fault for canceling. They are still selling tickets on their site as if the boat was still running which is a total scam.",
