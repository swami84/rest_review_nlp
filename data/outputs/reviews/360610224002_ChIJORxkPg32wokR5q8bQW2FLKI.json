They give you honey too, and it is definitely worth a dip or two because it just goes so well together! Their fries are good and their Mac is good but their chicken is fireeeee. Enjoy!

Im new to New York, so I wanted to eat at a place true to the urban landscape in Harlem. This place certainly didnt disappoint. There was a steady flow of people in and out but there was plenty of sitting for me to dine-in. I ordered the large curry goat for $15 and got plenty of food. Truthfully, the portion size could feed two or three average sized people. The goat was cooked and seasoned very well as it probably had been stewing for some time which made it tender too. The cabbage was crisp, maybe somewhat raw, but still good. The plantains were really good and sweet and the rice and beans were savory since they were covered in gravy and the juice from the curry goat. The food was hot and the curry spice gave this dish a nice scent. I was not disappointed at all. Some people have complained about the customer service but my experience was good. She made my order, didnt short me on food, asked the necessary questions to complete my order, and left me alone. To me, this is quality customer service. Will you be greeted with warm hellos and broad smiles? Probably not. But I would rather be served good food at decent prices rather than receive chummy service and pay $27 for less food and a nicer decor. Overall, my experience was great and exactly what I expected and wanted.",

I called today to place the order and was told that I needed to come into the store to place the order as no phone orders are allowed.  I told him that I was told something different and that I am not near the restaurant to place the order; I asked if he could make an exception and take my payment info over the phone.  He told me that I had to come into the store and that this wasn't his problem.  There was a complete disregard for the misinformation given by a member of the staff and a lack of empathy regarding the situation.  Had I known I needed to come into the store to place the order, I would've done so.  The most professional response to this situation would've been to take the order and my payment over the phone.

I live a long ways away from this particular Golden Crust.The server told me to wait she was going in the back to get me some special soup and that she wanted to make sure I had lots of meat and dumplings, so of-coarse I was thrilled.

She could have charged me half price or of-coarse let it be the customers decision if I wanted to purchase burnt soup.",
