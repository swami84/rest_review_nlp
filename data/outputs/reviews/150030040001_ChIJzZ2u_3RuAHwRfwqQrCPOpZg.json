So fresh and full of flavors.  Don't worry if you are not a fan of hot food, they do have mild curries to choose from.  Also, being Indian food, there are lots of vegetarian options for those living on a plant based diet.  For me, it has got to have meat and be spicy.  I zeroed in on the Pepper Chicken and Lamb Tikka Masala. Wow, both were over the top with great spices and preparation.  The yellow rice was a nice compliment for the curries, but if you want brown rice, they got that as well.  They have a few other items other then curry to complete or make your meal and I really enjoyed my homemade Ginger Lemonade that I got to wash down the spice with. Really was perfect to cleanse the palate after such a flavor extravaganza.  If you need to get your Indian curry fix on, I really recommend this place.",
