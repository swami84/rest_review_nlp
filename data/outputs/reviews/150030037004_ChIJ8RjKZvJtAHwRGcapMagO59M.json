Be prepared for a Kaiseki meal that will transport all of your senses to Japan. I'm nearly at a loss of words this was so good. My body feels so high from the quality and flavor of the dishes and I will not forget this experience. Thank you to the staff and chefs Kawasaki and Kumagi for making us feel so welcome. Oyshikata!

Its a very small place, so you need to make reservations in advance and make sure you not late. You have to park on the lot on Kalakaua, and next to the Assisted Living complex. You need to be heading makai (aka toward the ocean) and it will be on the right. Check out the pictures and you will see how amazing the food is! The service is 5 stars!!",
