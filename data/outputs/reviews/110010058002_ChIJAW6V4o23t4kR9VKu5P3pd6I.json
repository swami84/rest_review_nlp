This place takes negligence to a whole new level. Our water glasses were empty within the first ten minutes and remained empty throughout the meal. We had to raise our hands for 5 minutes to get their attention after we were ready to order.  This place definitely doesn't deserve the amount of business that it gets and if this place were on the West Coast it would've been out of business a long time ago.",

No orange flavor though. Simply uneatable. My husband can eat anything but not this time.  I had the chicken sesame. Which was tasteless. Not as bad as the beef but still.  The waiter or owner complained to us that the tip left was not enough. He could see we left most of our meal, but it did not occur to him to ask if we had an issue with the meal.  Thank god we had rice and a fortune cookie. It was a complete disappointment. Do not recommend.",

Entrees were mostly onions, spring rolls were overly cooked and supposed to be veggie - included uncleaned shrimp. Soup was bland, and wings were the most edible things we ordered.

The main thing is to force us to accept 18% of the tip! If the reason is not mandatory, I will not give it down. But it is very unhappy to be forced to give it. The boss has repeatedly said that this is a tourist area. In fact, I want to cut the Chinese to do a hammer sale! In short, very unpleasant! Very large hotel, the attendance rate is not high!

Instead of asking would you like to see Menu he was like in a rude voice \" you know what you want \"? I was so shock but then still I ordered and at the end I ask for extra sauce he is like it's in the bag i am like one extra \" at the end he brought and I was the one to thank but he has no response no thank you . If he is having this kind of attitude he shouldnt be running business . there are others staff nice and atleast have smile on their face when they talk . i will now never ever come to this place anymore . you are getting one star because I had no option to choose none .",

The rangoons were very small for the price, and they tasted like the deep fryer.  I get much better rangoon from several different places at home in STL.  While no other dishes needed to be sent back, the food was just very average.  I plan to visit DC many times more, but will not return to this restaurant.
