I ordered two pies from Call Your Mother for Thanksgiving. One of them was not what me or others in my household were expecting. A couple of days after Thanksgiving I got an email from CYM asking about my experience. I was very honest and said that one pie was pretty delicious while the other was not good at all but that the one that was good was great. In a matter of hours I get another email offering to refund me for my full order AND to deliver a cheesecake by the end of the week. It was unexpected and I said \u201cnot necessary but if you want to refund is fine\u201d. And said that no need for a cheesecake because I have recently had a surgery and friends sent many sweets. We were fine on the sweets department. Well, this past Friday my husband opens our door and CYM left us a couple of dozens of bagels...our favorites!  In a time when you go to some businesses that make major mistakes and the staff just treat you pretty bad just because a minor complaint, I have to give a big, big shout to CYM. What a way to repair a mistake AND gain a client for life.  Highly recommended because their bagels are for sure the best in the city (have said so several times before this) AND because this is definitively customer service at its very best. Thanks Call Your Mother!",

I mean the bagel is good for a DC bagel, but with these prices, I can\u2019t and won\u2019t... not worth it especially with their bad coffee... which was very disappointing. If you are looking for an an excellent bagel sandwich, run to Buffalo & Bergen!",

Yes, they have Bethesda Bagel (which never lives up to the hype) and Bullfrog Bagels (decent, but still not on par), but there's a serious need for a better option. Enter Call Your Mother.  It's not exactly NYC style, but that's intentional. The owners (who also own nearby Timber Pizza Company) wanted to create a bagel that merged the NYC style with Montreal style. They are successful.  They sell a variety of bagels and sandwiches and I do recommend each one. However, my go to is the sesame bagel with half homemade cream cheese and half berry jam. That combination is amazing.  Warning: They don't open every single day, so check them out online or on social to make sure they are open. Also, there's usually a long line.",

I ordered The Shyne with bacon on the everything bagel and OJ I had them put the spicy honey on the side and I drizzled it all over my bagel and that was the best addition to the sandwich delicious bagels that are about as close you'll get to New York bagels in DC don\u2019t get no better in DC imo, I was also able to taste the Rihanna-flex and that was hella delicious I actually wish I would\u2019ve ordered that love the smoked salmon and the crisp firm cucumbers and red onions but neither one disappointed, if you're lucky enough to sit inside which we were it's a shared table where you can get to know your neighbor and have conversations, this was so worth the trip and I will definitely be back, staff was nice and friendly.

The sandwich I got was fine, I got whitefish, bacon, and greens on a sesame. The bagel was a dense ball of dough honestly could get a better bagel at the grocery store. The bacon and the whitefish were amazing but they put so much greens on my sandwich it overshadowed the parts that I actually enjoyed.

Well, the line wasn't too bad and I waited about 45 minutes because I got my food.  So many different bagel sandwiches to choose from and if you don't like their menu, you can always build your own bagel sandwich.  For lunch there is also other options that are non-bagel stuff.  I love that they have other items on the menu, like potato latkes!  Yum!  I ordered the Shyne, the Amare, and Latkes.  Shyne - I decided to go with the pastrami one and omg it was sooooo good! I love that they do the folded eggs, just like the Deli's in NYC.  Was a bit nostalgic and enjoyed that sandwich a lot! Pastrami was delicious and the saltiness was balanced by the thick folded eggs.  Bagel was the perfect texture and not too difficult to bite through as a sandwich (you know when you bite on the bagel and everything falls out the other end cause it was too hard to bite through...yah, that doesn't happen here). lol.  The Amare - wasn't sure what candied salmon was, so I thought why not, let's give it a try!  Glad I did because I quite enjoyed half of this sandwich! It was soooo good!  The bagel used here was the Za'atar bagel, which has a pretty good flavor that made the sandwich even better!  Latkes - I do not think I have ever had potato latkes as crispy as the ones here!  Omg, I was so impressed by how these were made that after my first bite, I was in heaven!  They were so delicious - packed with flavor, the crispiness was wonderful, and I just wanted to eat more!  You didn't even need the condiments it comes with!  Definitely get this again!  There are so many other things I would like to try on the menu, so that just means I will have to come back again and try it all!  Until next time...",

I felt somewhat duped by the name and description of this place and it's really not the restaurants fault. $10 for a PB&J bagel?! This restaurant takes a unique twist on simple sweet and savory combination by adding fruit and house made granola (which I thought was a nice touch), and it's really just unnecessary. Open a jar of Jif and a smuckers classic grape, slap it on my fresh bagel and send me on my way for half the price (I seriously would have enjoyed it much more). I also had issue with the restaurant location and presentation. In my eyes there's a right and wrong way to go about gentrification of a neighborhood or area. Call your mother is on the wrong side of that (in my opinion). Extremely bright colors on the side of your corner building clearly marketed toward shallow-minded instagram story posting millennials (while overcharging for bagels) felt very very wrong.",

I'm so thrilled to have it in my neighborhood!  Don't be intimidated by the long lines, it moves quick and it'll be worth it when you enjoy your first bite of your bagel sandwich. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love that they have classics but also mix it up with some innovative combinations. You can order off their menu or create your own with a variety of interesting toppings including hummus, tomatoes, pastrami, capers, and more!  My only been with CYM is that they close at 2pm. I wish they stayed open later, because who doesn't love a bacon, egg & cheese for dinner?",

Lines can be pretty long here, but it moved pretty fast. Menu has good options, and a good variety of breakfast options (bacon/egg/cheese sandwich, bagel with lox, etc). They bring the order to your table if you decide to eat there, you just to the front counter if you take it to go. We got breakfast sandwiches, and they were excellently made, not too overstuffed, not greasy. Highly recommend anyone looking for a legit bagel and great breakfast come try here.",

I had a bagel with cream cheese and salmon and I absolutely enjoyed myself, and will probably go back. I bought 6 bagels to bring home, and with each one we became less and less enamored. It's really good; it's not magical.  Updated review after Second/Third/Fourth/Fifth visit. The people are really nice. The bagels are really good. The food comes out fast. The coffee is excellent.

I was astonished at how good the bread was and how quality everything was.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door. I vowed not to be deterred by the line and the line moved pretty quickly.  I ordered the Shyne with bacon and got the sandwich to go. I was really impressed with how amazing this sandwich was. The bodega-style egg was something I hadn't ever had before and the bacon was plentiful on the sandwich. Everything just worked together, especially with the bagel (which was SOOOO good).  I keep thinking about this place so I'm hoping I'll be back soon!",
