We always thought it was a basement bar, but do not let that deceive you - this is an excellent and quaint restaurant.  The food was outstanding, we had oysters with butter/ginger sauce... and they were out of this world. Oh the burger, I would try to describe it but I fear drooling on my keyboard.  Mostly it was the service that impressed us, they were super friendly and attentive. We felt at home and comfortable the entire time. Truly, if you're in Fort Greene you need to check this place out. <dools on keyboard>",

I had the home fries, which were fine but needed salt, and the lentil soup. Although the menu just said \"lentil,\" it was a red lentil soup - pureed smooth and bursting with complex flavor. The toasted bread was a great accompaniment. I liked it so much I ordered another to go! Decor is cute, service was good - I will be back.",

We will have a sectioned off space towards the back where the garden is.  What we got was... teeny plates of the finger food that were not replenished until one of us had to find a waiter and ask. Every. Time. And that's it.  NO main dishes. We waited and waited, asked and asked. They said they were working on it.  Never happened. NEVER FULFILLED THEIR PART OF THE DEAL.  OH... we also got a big surprise: We were approached with bill for almost THREE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL DOLLARS for gratuity and use of space and something that we still don't understand.

You also get warm complimentary bread, the staff was really friendly, nice setting for a romantic dinner, the restaurant wasn't too loud where you had to scream at each other, and the pricing was not bad at all.  Excellent wine selection with good prices, dessert was a light tasty end as it should be -",
