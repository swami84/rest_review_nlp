When you walk inside the front doors of Espita, you'll see a small sign by one of the murals by the bar that reads \"Ghostburger pick up.\" It's here you grab your burgers and fries.  My house ordered burgers on a Friday night for pick-up. It only took 25 minutes from placing the online order to picking it up. Service was fast and friendly.  The burgers themselves were small, but good. I ordered \"The Frenchie\" with a double patty and it was full of flavor. My crinkle cut fries on the side were a big portion. Each person in our house ordered one and we could have easily gotten away with just two for all four of us.  Overall, Ghostburger was a good experience.",

They also have great fries, both solid \"A\" ratings. Melange has the best burger in Shaw.  My #2 favorite burger and fries in Shaw are at Dacha. Dacha's burger has two patties, cheese, bacon, LTO, and peanut butter for a very unique experience. The ambiance at Dacha is also second-to-none. Sehr gem\u00fctlich.  So, after these two, I'd rate Ghostburger a solid #3 as a burger joint in Shaw.(Sorry Capital Burger but you're for the tourist crowd.)
