It's fried American and not tasty.  The place has a feeling of a dictatorship, the workers are petrified from the boss. Very unfriendly vibe to it.  My friend got a poached egg brunch special, the egg came after 15minutes cooked through and through, like your boiled egg (not like a half boiled egg) would be cooked less, so he didn't eat it, and asked for the bill.  The charge was there, when asked to remove it, after 10 minutes of the staff running and whispering around, and when inquiring again, they said that the chef will come out to talk to us, a overly sweaty (thinking of what happens with all that dripping sweat in the kitchen..) chef comes out, and starts arguing;  Chef: did you eat the spinach? Costumer: no! Chef: did u eat the potatoes? Costumer: yes! Etc etc..  it was amusing, like a serious interrogation, and in the end only wanted to remove half the dishes costs. I was shocked but compassionate with the chefs tactics in a way, because the place was empty like a ghost town..",

Could of used a bit more kick and tomato flavor but still satisfying. Nice options of specials and i went with the veggie omlette special. Fresh ingredients and the veggies were bursting with flavor especially the string beans and corn. Tasted like it was straight from the farm. Wonderful bratwurst that had a nice crisp and spice to it. Go for the scone as well. Fresh butter and buttery soft scone texture. The cherry compote accompanied it well. I'll be back again.",

I went to this event that was held in a retail store(don't recall what it was for), and they happened to be serving these divine hors d'oeuvres and amazingly delicious kiwi cocktails.  I took note of this restaurant with the intention of dining there.  Fast forward to a year later, and I'm planning a surprise engagement/wedding send-off brunch for my best friend and her husband.  I immediately recall that September night where I had filed Kiwiana into my foodie brain, and contacted the chef, Mr. Mark Simmons.  After some email correspondence, I worked out the date, pre-fixe price per head and custom menu(including unlimited drinks) for our party of close to 30.  Since it is a small space, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves for the duration of the event.  The staff was so helpful and generous with the time we spent there; I was thoroughly impressed. The scrumptious scones and the ribs were a delicious hit, as were the kiwi cocktails.  We were never rushed out; plenty of time was given to our guests of honor for mingling and creating memories.  When they ran out of the kiwi mimosas, they offered up regular ones down to the very last minute.  The chef came out to greet us afterwards which added a more personal touch.  Needless to say, the bride and groom were very happy and it was a very successful event.  I would definitely consider hosting another special day here.",

Eggs Benedict whilst looking great, was totally let down down with what was meant to be hollandaise but in fact something that resembled whipped butter.
