Of course upon receiving my order ( take out ) both are wrong,  instead of extra shrimp they add chicken and the second entree they never removed peppers and carrots as i requested. Place was quiet during early weekday so it wasn't busy. really disappointed in the quality too Place used to be good 10 yrs ago or so.

The older one ignores me and the young one is clearly enamored with my husband. On Mother's Day I twice told her I wanted Spicy Thai Basil with ground beef. She brought out an Americanized version assuming I didn't know what I wanted. My husband clarified, in Thai, what I wanted and she much later brought out something with zero spice. ZERO! I had ordered a Thai iced tea and only after she didn't bring it with the other drinks and my husband asked her where it was did she say that they were out. She twice refilled all the water on the table except mine. We're giving it one more shot but I have experienced bigotry before, having had the nerve to be white and marry a Thai man, but these ladies need to get their acts together or they will ruin a once great restaurant!",
