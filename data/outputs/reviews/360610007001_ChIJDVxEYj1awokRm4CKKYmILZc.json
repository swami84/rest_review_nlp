The wine was okay. Nothing to write home about. But the dulce de leche for dessert. Divine.  I also had breakfast in the restaurant and being midweek and a bit late, it was nearly empty. My food was fine. The coffee was good and the service was as well. No complaints. I don't know that I would go out of my way to eat here, but for hotel food, it was far better than most.",

The restaurant itself is nice looking and pictures showed they have a nice roof bar for warmerweather. We went on a Saturday night in hopes of finding a decent place to drink right next to our hotel.  It was dead. Like really dead. The bartender was inattentive and wasn't great about making mixed drinks. It smelled like someone broke a beer bottle, then half cleaned it up. Maybe this place is better over the summer.",

        "caption": "Terribly overpriced with subpar service for all that extra expense.  I visited this bar once shortly after the hotel opened and attributed the poor service to the new situation and growing pains, but now after returning a few years later, I find the same terrible service and the sky high prices of downtown for no reason other than the privilege of being downtown.  Today, I showed up at 5pm with several coworkers; we made reservations for a party of 10-15 and were expected. They did, at least, have our tables reserved. There were no more than 10 other customers in total in the bar at that point. We nevertheless had to wait nearly ten minutes just to speak with the server. They failed to bring our table menus even after we asked for them twice. I asked them what beers were available since they seemingly didn't want to bring us menus. The server listed 4 before straining their memory. I settled on the Goose Island they had mentioned, knowing I liked their IPAs.  I watched the server putter around for at least 10 minutes. They may have been waiting on the bartenders, but again, it was not busy by any stretch of the imagination. They finally come over with two beers on their tray and set one on my table and walk away. I smelled it and immediately knew it was a pilsner and not the IPA I requested. Rather than wait another 10-15 minutes to resolve this, I went to the bar. The server was there with the other beer still on their tray. I told them mine wasn't right and they simply handed me the one from their tray. I smelled it again and again, it didn't smell right. I asked them for menus and was given a red menu.  Upon returning to my table, I noticed that the menu was not a drink menu but strictly a food menu. I sipped my beer and it was definitely not the IPA I ordered. I returned to the bar to get a drink menu and exchange my beer. Again. Looking at the drink menu, I saw that the Goose Island was not, in fact, an IPA but a seasonal ale, which the server did not mention; they clearly said it was an IPA.  I went straight to the bartender this time and told them it wasn't the drink I wanted and that they gave me the wrong info. I told them to forget the beer and give me a bourbon. The bartender poured my drink and asked if I had a tab; I said we did for the table, but I still hadn't gotten my first drink served correctly which was on that tab. I told them I would pay the difference in cash because it wasn't a happy hour drink but the bartender took my $20 and gave me back $8, keeping the full price of the drink.  I've learned my lesson. This garbage bar can keep the money. I'll never go there again, regardless, and I'll tell everyone I speak with to avoid it like the plague. I told all my coworkers who arrived afterward what a mess it was and how it took more than 45 minutes and three attempts to finally get a watered down bourbon for $18 (the price of the beer plus the bourbon). We certainly won't be booking any future company events at this dump ever again. Stay away.",

In from out of town with a party of ten on Mother's Day weekend, we tried to be prepared and find places that would accommodate us. We went in around 7pm on Friday with about 6 of us and my diabetic grandmother took out a snack, as no one had come to serve us. We were immediately told we couldn't have outside food. I tried to explain the situation and that all of us would be ordering and eating, but were advised she would have to leave and not eat. Awesome. As I said, we had a big party and my grandmother has a hard time walking, so I reluctantly asked to see if we could have a reservation for Mother's Day morning brunch. I was advised I didn't need a reservation, but they would absolutely be able to accommodate us. I reiterated that it was for Mother's Day and confirmed it was the same price and offerings as their \"regular\" weekend brunch. I was assured this was correct. To be sure, as I walked out, I confirmed AGAIN - because I already had a reservation elsewhere that would accommodate us. Fast forward Mother's Day morning. We all came down and we're turned away - advised that brunch isn't served until 11 (we were told we would be accommodated at 10). We would NOT be able to have brunch, only buffet breakfast and would not be able to take advantage of unlimited drinks as advertised because that began at 11. Not even at 1030. No manager. No one else to speak to. Absolute refusal, not even an attempt to accommodate since another employee had given us this information. I should have known after our first encounter, but unfortunately convenience is not always best. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL. Walk one door down and go to Harry's if you want to stay close. Much better food, ambiance, service and price.",
