The basic gist is you order various plates of raw meats and vegetables that they bring to your table that are mostly thin sliced. In the center of your table is a grill and you and your dinner guests grill the various pieces right there, then pick them up of the grill, dip them is a bit of one of the three sauces they are known for, and eat immediately. And it is just fantastic. The service can be a bit slow but the key is to order several plates at a time and place your next order once those plates arrive (or soon after). The place can be a bit expensive but they do offer great lunch specials and great combination dinner arrangements for those who have never been and don't know what to choose. But you must absolutely no matter what pick a couple of the premium kalbi selections.",

The 2-item is $11.95 and the meat lovers 13.95 which includes 3oz more meat and a half order of Japanese sausage.  Food was great and meat marinades were really good too. Just a tip for you, the grill is turned on at high, which is good for beef, but for chicken and pork I would suggest you switch the grill to medium so your meat doesn't burn.  Will definitely come back!",

The more you pay, the more options that are available to you. You have 90 minutes to eat, and everyone in your party has to order from the same tier (I guess so people can't get away with paying less for a lower tier while another person in the party gets a higher tier and shares with the former person). The food was tasty and the experience was cool, but I'm not super into grilled meats. My family enjoyed it though, and we had a nice time together. My husband still is in search of some jalepeno wantons he had there but no luck coming across them anywhere else! Anywho,  just be prepared to spend some money if you stop in as a place like this can be pricey and make a reservation ahead of time!",

Their pacing with bringing out dishes is normally great. And they're usually on top of refills. They're normally checking on your needs without being too often. Cooking your own food is always fun. It's food and it's art. It's necessary and it's entertainment. All in all fantastic and I cannot wait to visit again.",
