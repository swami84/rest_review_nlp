Unfortunately removing 1 star as some employees don\u2019t fill the bowl up nearly all the way - and at $11/ bowl - which is already darn steep - that\u2019s often the difference between whether we decide to get them or not (sadly for my taste buds, recently it\u2019s more often not :/ due to price). PS. Call to order - the apps online have the wrong topping prices / availability and I think there\u2019s a surcharge as well.",

They have such a large menu and they even have puppy bowls (my dog LOVES them). The servings are very generous and prices are reasonable (especially considering the size).  They are super accommodating in terms of dietary preferences and restrictions. We cannot wait to continue coming back!  January 2021: UPDATE: two months later and Rush Bowls is still going above and beyond! The food is consistently delicious and they are always accommodating to our dietary needs. They always make sure to take care of my pup too, which is much appreciated :). We have switched to getting our food delivered (we are quarantining due to having a new baby)  and I have been pleasantly surprised by how well the smoothies and smoothie bowls have been traveling with delivery. Thank you for being a new staple in our diets!!",
