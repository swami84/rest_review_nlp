What I have come  to love about Mission DuPont during COVID is it\u2019s beautiful and large streetery. I feel super safe eating on the patio. The staff follow all protocols, therefore, allowing its guest to relax and have some sort of \u201cnormal\u201d happy hour, brunch, dining experience. I had my birthday brunch last weekend, sunny and 30 degrees! We had a great table in the sun with a wonderful heater. Jeff was an awesome server. I love the margaritas, you can\u2019t go wrong with those! We started with waffle fries to share and then I ordered then chilaquiles for my brunch item. Others order the tacos which was a nice complement after waffle fries, chips and guac. I\u2019m so glad to see this bar doing well since COVID. I appreciate the \u201call hands on deck\u201d approach and I loook forward to going back for more outings in the coming weeks.",

When the food came out, the waiters just put the food on the table and didn\u2019t bring us plates or silverware. We had to keep asking the hostess for these items. We had to keep asking the hostess when the rest of the food was coming out. We had to keep asking the bartender for our drinks. What terrible service and food. Not worth the $45 I spent that day. Shoutout to the hostess tho for doing other people\u2019s job. But if I could give this place negative 5 stars, I would! Never again.",

I had to pick a menu myself from the host's area/entrance. This review is not for the food, but more so my experience with the service with my particular bartender, Erin, and the response by the general manager, Devon.  It took about forty minutes for my meal and about thirty of that was waiting for food, or waiting for Erin to take my order. I was checked on once (how is your food) when I asked Erin for extra sauce for my quesadillas. In the entire forty minutes, neither bartenders, or any employee checked up on my water. If I remember correctly, I had to ask the male bartender and Erin, for water twice per person (total 4x).  I told the GM, Devon exactly what I posted above and said it was the worst bar experience I had in Arlington or DC. Devon said she was \"sorry\" and claimed that it was unusual for the two bartenders who were currently working at the time.  Devon said sorry about four times and then gave me the impression of what more do you want from me and stop wasting my time.  Devon told me to give them another chance another day. Devon did not offer to comp anything (not that I asked) on a $30 brunch. Devon never said she would talk to the bartenders or get them better trained.  To be honest, I'm not surprised by the response considering Devon and the other employees were chatting it up most of the time at the end of the bar (near the kitchen entrance) I was there.  If the owner or upper management sees this review I am curious what the response will be. I'm sure you can look at the video of the bar area yourself and confirm this. I talked to a friend who has been a bartender for a few years and she said it is probably just a bad business based on the service and GM response. Take that however you want.  Might as well just get burritos at Chipotle if you're in Dupont. What a waste of time.",

Turn out was 16 ppl in all and the manager, David was so accommodating. He was personable, professional, and made my mother's night even better, when he brought out her bday cake! When I made the reservations I requested the lovely gentlemen I had my first time there, Diego. He was prompt, funny, and just had a great attitude! Thank you Mission for a wonderful experience.

The server confirmed the mistake was theirs (I ordered and she copied the right item down, but the wrong item was served.)  When I pointed it out, she notified the kitchen who hastily prepared my order and did not cook the fish all the way.  We all know that large groups take a while to serve, which normally isn't an issue, but when you make a mistake like this what ends up happening is the meal goes back for a third try as my friends are finishing their meal.  The server did *not* offer to comp my meal--the meal I had not even eaten yet, by the way--and offered me a free beer to \"thank me for my patience.\"  Things then went south as I became very very hangry.  I honestly gave up on them at that point, left my group and went somewhere else for a meal.  The rest of them seemed to enjoy the meal, but I was too hungry to wait for another meal.",

There were 3 servers working behind the bar (a white man with blonde hair, a white woman with brown hair, and a black/mixed woman). We waited, and waited, and waited...for over 10 minutes just waiting for someone to acknowledge us and ask to take our order. That never happened. We finally had to FLAG someone down, and when we did, she acted irritated that we were wanting service. We placed our order and after 20 minutes, it arrived...HALF OF MY ORDER MISSING and was given NO EATING UTENSILS, NAPKINS, OR DRINKS. At this point, we didn't want to even bother asking for anything because we just wanted to get out of the LOUDEST bar I have ever been to (SO LOUD THE SERVERS COULD NOT HEAR THE PATRONS). We walked outside to sit down and there were NO SEATS because NON-PAYING PATRONS were using the seating area for PAYING CUSTOMERS to socialize. Even after all this, we decided it wasn't worth it to bring up another issue to the staff, since they all seemed irritated and less than helpful, so we walked back inside to find a table somewhere. After walking around back, we found several empty tables and decided to sit. However, as we started to sit (STILL HALF MY ORDER MISSING AND NO EATING UTENSILS, NAPKINS OR DRINK), another employee (black woman) told us we could not sit there because we needed reservations and if we wanted to sit there, we had to walk BACK up to the front, stand in line (behind 10-12 other people), check in with the hostess, and be seated. At this point, I had reached my boiling point and asked for a manager, only to find out, the black woman who told me I had to go back up front and wait in line with my FOOD GETTING COLD, STILL MISSING HALF MY ORDER, STILL WITH NO EATING UTENSILS, STILL WITH NO NAPKINS, AND STILL WITH NO DRINK, was the MANAGER. I told her what the issue was and rather than apologize and help us, by seating us and taking the initiative to handle whatever their \"policy\" was about being seated in an EMPTY ROOM within the eatery/bar, she was incredibly rude and stated, \"It really is a simply concept.\" It was clear this place had NO IDEA WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE is, which is a \"SIMPLE CONCEPT\" especially when you're in the CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY. Furthermore, it was clear they were not interested in paying customers or tips. We asked for our money back, left our food, and went to another wonderful eatery where we HEAVILY TIPPED the wonderful staff. The Mission needs a COMPLETE EMPLOYEE OVERHAUL. Unbelievable.",

The customer service and staff were far from it. While having dinner in the dining side of Mission on Friday, my wallet was stolen right out of my purse as I was eating. It must have been an employee because none of the tables around us left while we were there and my cards were charged at a liquor store a couple blocks away from the restaurant while we were there. They have cameras, but claimed they were \"fuzzy\" which was no help and pretty useless. The police came and a report was filed, but I was and still am very dissatisfied with the experience I had at this establishment.",

Between that and the happy hour prices for margaritas and quesadillas, this is a very great location that I would wholeheartedly recommend for visiting if you're either in the D.C. or, more specifically, the Dupont Circle area.

The drinks here are good however the food was just average. Definitely nothing to write home about.  One thing to note. While most older buildings in DC have insect problems, ni one wants to see them while eating. While sitting at a hightop near the opening to the kitchen area on the first floor, our wives suddenly screamed and leaped from the table where the birthday cake was located. As it turns out there was a roach crawling on the wall. After letting an employee know, he immediately grabbed a towel and removed it.",

Meaning, when it comes to Tex-Mex or authentic Mexican food, we have a bit of experience.  Firstly, this place was VERY crowded for what I would expect on a Thursday night. Lots of college kids, and a few business type individuals. Had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. I didn't rate this restaurant 1 star for this, as it can happen with any restaurant.  Only thing that was very aggravating, is how loud it was. We were sitting two feet away from each other, and had to resort to texting, to be able to hold a conversation. College kids being loud and obnoxious, with loud music (sounded like dubstep or something with very heavy bass) playing over the speakers.  Our waiter was MIA (missing in action) for 95% of the time. Once we did get our food, we did not have any silverware. I ended up asking a different waiter for some, since we couldn't find ours. This waiter only brought one set. I ended up going up to the hostess for second set.  For the food itself:  The salsa was.... Okay. They have green and red salsa. Both are not spicy whatsoever. Chips were passable.  I ordered the enchilada plate, and she ordered the burrito.  My girlfriend order a burrito. She only ate about a fourth of it before calling it quits. Basically, it just was not good.  My enchiladas arrived cold the beef was mediocre, the chicken tasted like it was something processed (think McNuggets from McDonald's). The cheese one was... Acceptable. The side of rice was chewy and cold. I did not try the side of beans, so I don't have an opinion.  We ended up having to get a hold of the manager in order to pay our bill. We did pay it in full, but due to the terrible service from the waiter, we did not leave a tip. The manager was very nice and accommodating. We did not take our left overs.  For the rest of our vacation, we will not chance eating Mexican food again.",

Even though this is in a very busy area, there is plenty of street parking after 6:30 pm on Massachusetts Ave NW. The restaurant has a great ambiance with a rustic feel and not the over the top Mexican place.  The menu was simple and easy to order from.  I went with the taco platter.  I don't normally say this but the service was Freeky Fast.  The order was well presented (see photo) and the food was good.  I normally don't order desert, but everything was going so well.. why not?  The Churros are made in house.  They took a bit longer, but I appreciated getting them freshly prepared and super crispy.  The accompanying chocolate sauce was a great surprise... It had a spice/kick to it.  It was a great match for Churros.  Overall.. great place and I will be back.",

They worked with me to make sure I had the best space for my event as possible. I arrived a little early on the day of and they seated me right away. Our waiter checked in frequently and they made sure we had everything we needed; she even split up the bill at the end of the night when there was 12+ of us! Also the drinks and food are so good and come out super quick. I will never stop raving about their nachos! All in all, would recommend going to Mission to anyone in all regards.",

They had a small room (no door) off the main dining area that can fit up to (probably 15). Although you can hear the noise from the dining area--I went on a Thursday evening during happy hour which was probably poor timing--it is still quiet enough to hear everyone at the table. For even larger groups, they have a loft upstairs that is more private and definitely quieter. The staff I spoke with in advance was great and very accommodating, and the wait staff was great as well. We will definitely be utilizing Mission again! There's not many places in the DC area that are so accommodating for large groups at no cost--which is vital as an NGO volunteer in need of space!",

I organize a monthly happy hour and we all pay our own tabs and Mission was accommodating in giving us a designated spot that was large enough for our group and allowed had no minimum bill requirements. They even posted signs in the designated area so everyone would know where our group was when they walked in! I definitely plan to host another event here.

They also give split checks without complaint, which is a gem for large parties. The food is reasonably priced and delicious (I got tacos, but the fajitas looked amazing). Also, try the white sangria! I'm usually not a sangria fan, but it's so delicious that our entire table chose to order it by the end of the dinner! Overall, best deal for your money in Dupont as a large party.",

My stomach is still upset and I wrote on back of my check that this was the worst food I had during my time in DC, a city I lived in for 3 years, and I know this beautiful city has the best food around. I was so unimpressed that I dare not order drinks. This place is the worst. The combination of rude, wait staff, serving barely digestible food, made this place the worst in DC.",
