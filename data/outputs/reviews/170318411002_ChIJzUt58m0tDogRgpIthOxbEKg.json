I went down the list and ordered one of each which ended up with a fairly large bill but at the end I enjoyed all my choices but wanting more.  I would recommend the lamb meat - that seems to be the juiciest and tasty of the entire bunch.  Recommendation - Review the items in Yelp for pictures to the item - That helped me.",

We didn\u2019t get to try it since the line was long. So, we came back to visit on week night. Still lots of people but not that bad. We came for the hotpot skewers, since it was new to us. In terms of menu selections, this place is specialized in skewers and small dishes. Food is on spicy side. If you like Szechuan food or Xin Jiang food, this will be the place for you.  We ordered 3 items: grilled skewers, hotpot skewers and fried rice. The most memorable one will be their house special grilled lamb XinJiang style. We initially ordered 3, but it was so good my son asked for another 4 for himself. We also ordered regular grilled lamb and beef, those were okay only. Meat wise, those were tiny compared to the grilled lamb xinjiang style. Hotpot skewers cost $30, and I think it\u2019s overpriced for what you get. If you\u2019ve never tried it, it\u2019s just like mala hotpot with all the meats in the skewers. Nothing special.  Overall: Menu: 3.5-4stars Food: 4stars Service: 4stars Price: $-$$  Highly recommend the grilled lamb xinjiang style!",
