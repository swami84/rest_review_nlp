The food arrived on-time, however, the chicken dish tasted...for lack of a better word, terrible. It was very bland, not seasoned, and the pasta tasted and looked like it was swimming in water.  The half tray of chicken picatta cost $63.00. $63.00 of which I believe I should be reimbursed. The office staff, as well as myself, couldn\u2019t eat any more than a bite.  The staff said they have ordered from Zig Zag kitchen prior to my visit, and it has been delicious. Which is why they specifically requested it for today\u2019s lunch.  I called and spoke with a manager. I couldn\u2019t be more unhappy with my experience. He said that the chicken dish was made in bulk and sent to 3 other places for lunch and nobody else complained about the taste. Which to me, means nothing. Just because people aren\u2019t calling to complain about taste doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t taste bad. It also disregards my experience, as well as the office staff, being unable to eat the food made in their kitchen. The manager also said that they\u2019ve probably ordered from another restaurant before, inferring why it tastes different. Still, no justification. Plus, why be okay with YOUR restaurant\u2019s food tasting bad and another\u2019s tasting good.  He then said he would get food delivered there tomorrow (in redemption of the food today), then he looked up the address and took back his gesture. Said it was too far and didn\u2019t recognize the address.  To top it off, my receipt that needs to be expensed says \u201ccountry\u2019s best pizza Inc.\u201d - not Zig Zag kitchen (the way it\u2019s advertised on their website).  Safe to say, I will never be ordering from here again due to the food not being good and very poor customer service.",
