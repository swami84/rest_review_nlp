Henry the owner was very professional and treated my friends and I with respect and made sure we were happy with the services through out the night. The food was great really good with flavor. I\u2019m big on flavor! The drinks was great as well. We had a very cool waiter very professional name Eli who made sure we were good the whole time we were there. The music was great both DJs entertained the crowd. I will definitely come here again and also tell others about this Restaurant/Lounge Suite 704.",

Everyone who works there  is lovely, from the bartender, to the servers, to the owner, And yes the manager was down to earth , who you\u2019ll most certainly meet. He runs the show, The music is on point, Yes, please. And then there\u2019s the glorious, dreamy, crispy, crunchy, heavenly jerk salmon , lightly burnt, and the honey-kissed garlic shrimp, To sums the entire entourage had an amazing time, from dinning downstairs to dancing upstairs!

The customer service was spectacular... thanks to Bre for keeping our party updated on the status of our entrees and thanks to Roy for being such a wonderful host. The mimosas, bellinis and sangria were truly unlimited and new pitchers were delivered to our table before we were done with the previous ones! The ambiance was welcoming and quaint...the bathrooms are also meticulously kept. If you are considering brunch in Crown Heights, you will not be disappointed if you choose Suite 704!",

Bartenders are subtle and soft spoken ,but neat and tidy. Now as far as food menu its pretty good, but the food takes a little to long to be served . There was a few complaints of the food arrival tardiness. I'm not one to complain ,but when there is numerous complaints on the same matter I cant over look it . Word of advice .....owner please hire a new bar manager, the one there is uninviting, soft spoken,way too relaxed, and honestly not keen to being abrupt with a hostile crowd . You all at this establishment have a a bright future, just hire ,train ,and properly prepare your employees for fast pace events . God bless and be great !!!",

Well i got just that stir fry vegetables, no rice or plantaing tbat i would have received with my tofu. Finally my lady ordered oxtail meal for $22. With rice ,plantains while my veggies was $20.00. They really need to get things. Back to where they were on my first visit. The waitress was so apologetic and tried very hard to make a bad situation better",

This turned into a half hour wait. It was a very busy night so I completely understood that. We finally got seated and were ready to order. My husband and I are vegan and was interested in getting veggie sliders that were on the menu. The waiter took our order then after another half hour wait, told us they were out of veggie sliders. We ended up ordering 2 orders of fries. After another 15 minute wait the waiter brought out one order of fries and forgot the other.  I decided to continue to support my people so I gave this place another chance. I came here on a Sunday. It was not crowded. We did not get greeted at the door and we did not get seated. We decided to take it upon ourselves to sit at the bar. The waitress came over and tossed 2 menus towards us. We asked if there were any available tables, she said no. We looked at lunch menu and this time there were no vegetarian options on it. We asked if we could tweek something from the menu to add vegetables and the waitress seemed as if we were giving her too much of a task. There was a lot of attitude and she seemed frustrated. I understand this is a new business but it\u2019s unfair to people who are coming to support and just looking for a bite to eat. I wish this business much luck as success and I hope things get better for them.",

I ordered five beers and somehow wound of paying for six, which seems suspect to me because I was very clear with what I wanted. The bartender was so busy taking care of everyone else and left my card in the machine I had to ask for it back. Just bad customer service. The music was good and the bouncer at the door was pleasant but the staff was SLOW and everyone seemed to have a chip on their shoulder except for one waitress who actually smiled at me.",

Karaoke Wednesdays. It was def \ud83d\udd25 the days I went. Dont remember about a happy hour tho. They end business between 3am and 330 no later. They have a second level. They use for private events. They could the fix the air down there once it gets crowded. They seem to be doing pretty well.",
