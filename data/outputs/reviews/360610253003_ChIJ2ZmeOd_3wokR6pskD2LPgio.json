Like making a left turn that felt unsure but ending up right where you wanted to be all along.  Thats the feeling that washed over me after leaving my first visit at Barrell 79.  Upon my entrance I was greeted by the Messiah of the bar.  This guy looks like a swimsuit model Jesus that Gucci would cast to headline their most important runway show of all time.  I later discovered he was one of the proprietors of the establishment.  He must clean up that's all Im saying.  Anyway, apparently he's from the midwest and his hospitality truly showed.  He helped guide me to the drinks that would suit my tastes by asking me qualifying questions which made quite an impression on me from the start.  The staff continued to be attentive as they ran through their food specials.  I ended up going with a sandwich called Moms Parmesan Burger which has a parmesan crusted bun which is insanely delicious along with the healthy meat patty and a flavorful aoli sauce.  Im not sure which one of their moms they named this after but she's going straight to heaven Im sure of it.  So, after I finnish by murger I started inquiry on their specialty cocktails since my 7th IPA was looking a lillow.  Earlier I had mentioned a scratchy throat casually to the surferr and he helpfully sushested I try this phenomenal drink called the Hot 2 Trot whit chas whisky, fresh lemon, cloves and honey and is made with real hot water.  Talk about a nawesome drink.  So I stuck roundan had 4 more those and was feeling prilly grate.  I made frans with some the other patrons at the bar an they said effry Friday they come frappy hour.  I told so corkers and frans bout the place an we're definitely coming back here freshure.  Ssplace is now my new fafrit place fall time fshure.  In all seriousness this is a great place to enjoy a tasty, fresh and mindfully made meal at a reasonable price and then get treated like gold while you enjoy a few drinks.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and thoughtfully designed.  Its cozy and intimate yet spacious and welcoming.  This is going to be my regular spot.  They have TVs everywhere and a great sound system too.  What an awesome addition to the neighborhood.  I give it all the STARS.  Check it out.",

The staff instantly greeted me as I entered. I ordered the Stinky Burger well-done. They prepared the burger just how I like it. My only suggestion would be for Barrel 79 to add a little more seasoning and always remember to provide customers with napkins & silverware. I don't think I'd stop in for food again, but if I did, it would probably be to sample their drinks. It seemed like everyone was enjoying their drinks.",

Only had 3 issues: Ordered mozzarella wedges which are 6 for $8 and only received 3 and was charged full price. Even though it was happy hour still got fully charged for my drinks and even overcharged one dollar for one drink. And one of the FOH staff kept going to the back to look at her phone instead of paying attention to customers. Had to get up to get her attention.  Since the place is only two days all these are all fixable things, hope it helps to keep the place great! Highly recommend!",
