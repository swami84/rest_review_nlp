If I didn\u2019t order a pickup, I\u2019d never walk in a place like this during COVID. I was wearing my PPE mask, so I walked quickly through the crowds.  But there is worse. They told me the order is cancelled. After I reach home, I noticed that they cancelled it 15 minutes after I ordered. You should not cancel your customer\u2019s order and at the same time text them it\u2019s ready for pickup.",

About a week ago I ordered some Japache noodles, I was eagerly awaiting them since it is one of my favorite meals. Unfortunately that eagerness was grossly misplaced emphasis on the word grossly because I found a hair in my noodles. Nothing disgusts me more than finding hairs in my food. I immediately tried to get a refund from the food ordering app that I used and I was denied because apparently for them it's ok to have hair in your food. I guess in this age of Corona we all need the extra keratin. Afterwards I started to feel ill due to the nastiness of my meal. I am exceedingly disappointed by my experience and do not recommend this establishment or order mela through Uber Eats.",

I was immediately disappointed by this unprofessionalism. After finally sitting down, our server told my wife and I that the chicken would tale about 20 minutes to prepare, so we ordered a 20 piece half and half wings. However, the chicken DID NOT take 20 minutes like we were told; it took about 35-40 minutes. Now, I don't mind waiting this long, especially for this chicken, which indeed was very good, but I was disappointed that I was told false information. All in all, yes, this place has good chicken, but going there isn't worth the unprofessional staff.",

Their beer pours during lunchtime and happy hour are quite large. Gotta appreciate more bang for ya buck. Each day they have awesome happy hour deals. I was there when the Korean wings were half off (10 wings for like 6.50. Can't beat  that!) and the wings were perfectly crispy. The only downfall was that the wings lacked flavour. I asked if I could have a side of both sauces (since I ordered half soy garlic and half spicy) but they didn't offer that which was also a bummer. I suggest maybe asking for a few extra dips in their sauce before handing them over to ya.",

I called and placed an order for 30 wings and shrimp fried rice. when I arrived they wouldn't accept the offer for take out. FINE NBD. Wasn't going to complaint but when I got home I discovered  the wings undercooked and the shrimp fried rice looked like it had been reheated in the microwave. If u eat here often, you'd know the rice come with a poached egg. This egg however looked poached but had a hard yellow center as if it had been reheated. Was highly disappointed with the quality and customer service.",

The other couple also ordered drinks and 2 orders of food. 10 min later I get my drink and the waiter asks me if I would like a draft of bottle of beer, I said instead if he could change it to a margarita. He responded with a tone of voice saying, \"Oh so now you want a margarita?\" 10 min later he came with the margarita and we took one sip of it, it was horrendous. No ice, Full of triple sec, agave nectar and lime mix. My wife almost threw up from that nasty drink, so when the waiter came back I told him that we would like the beer instead. He said \"so now you want the beer?\" With an even louder tone of voice. 5 min pass and bartender (tall Caucasian guy) came over and said who ordered the margarita. I told him I did and it wasn't a margaharita, it tasted nothing like it. Hes like thats how we make it here. I told him I would like a bud light, draft, instead and he replied \"first of all im going to have to ask you to lower your tone of voice and be more polite\" i told him to get me the manager and he said he was the manager, then i said to get the check. We got up and left. He is definitely not the manager the manager we delt with before is kind and withought hesitation changes the orders withought insulting the customer",

Seeing that there was a restaurant nearby that was open late with food that looked good was a proposition that seemed to good to be true. Unfortunately, it was just that.  We went in for dinner around 6:45 and got a nice seat in the corner. We were greeted by who I think was our server(still not sure to this moment) and asked for some water to start. Realizing that happy hour was ending in just a few minutes we put in an order for 2 beers around 6:55, specifically mentioning that we wanted to put it in before 7 for the happy hour deal. Our server told us it was okay and walked away. We flagged her down a few minutes later and asked for 2 appetizers(also included in the happy hour) and she said she\u2019d go ahead and put the order in. At 7:03 she returned asking again what our order was before saying \u201cunfortunately, it\u2019s way past 7 so we won\u2019t be able to do happy hour\u201d. This was infuriating!  Nevertheless, we tried to move forward with open minds. After we ordered our food our server rushed off before we were able to order drinks and she avoided eye contact for about 10 minutes. We were finally able to order our drinks and we remained optimistic. Our food came along with this nasty man(who we later found out was the manager)that seemed offended simply by our presence. He slammed our plates on the table and rushed off without a word. Still missing utensils, we sat in shock as to what had just happened.  Overall, the only saving grace was this fantastic gentleman named Josh. When no one else showed the slightest bit of care, he was there consistently checking to see if there was anything that he could do for us. We will never return however I wish that there could be more people in the industry like Josh.",

Staff is really friendly and the food comes out quick. The wings surprisingly came out in 10 mins, but I do think that bon chon and other places in Va have better wings. The other wings tend to be bigger with a lil more flavor. The spicy buffalo sauce for the wings are great and if your a fan of spicy wings they do it right here. They have plenty of tvs to watch your favorite sports and the seating is great for large groups. Highly recommend this place if you want wings and good drink specials",

It's a little on the loud side due to room acoustics, but still a good place to grab a beer (pint or pitcher) or wine and enjoy some conversation (and the aforementioned wings, spicy or garlicky). They have a Korean liquor that is pretty tasty (try a flight with different flavors) - but careful, it will give you a serious buzz. Other than wings, I recommend the bulgogi sliders for a *very* light bite. The street tacos were OK, very messy to eat. The chicken skewers were surprisingly UNinspired by comparison with their other options, but if you like \"plain\" food, go for it. There is outdoor seating which is often unfilled.",

It took about 30 minutes to get my drink and another 30 minutes to pay by credit card when everyone in our party was annoyed and wanted to leave.  The server failed to bus the table, leaving dirty dishes in front of us.  We finally stacked them up for her and placed them at the end of the table, where they sat until we left.  This could have been a fun place if they would fix the service and drink prices (serve me two drinks at half the price).  As it is, I don't see why anyone would return.",

I'm a fan of wings just about anywhere, but now, I wish that all wings could be like these. We got both kinds: which were equally different, and equally delicious. + Tasty bar food (I got divine Pork Buns) + Amazing atmosphere. Cool and Industrial. + Multiple TVs for Football season.  Cons: - It is definitely pricy. You'll end up buying lots of wings. - Same-old Bethesda parking situation. Look for a garage, or you'll get a headache.  Go for the wings, stay for the rest. MoMo chicken is going to become my new lunch spot pretty quickly. I just better watch my wallet!",

The happy hour specials are very reasonable and the staff are great and friendly. The food is very tasty and always prepared well. The kitchen seems to be running well. I'd give them 5 stars except for the sports and news focus of the televisions. They really should put something on the TV's that is enjoyable, like maybe a movie marathon or Orphan Black or even a music video YouTube feed or something.",

        "caption": "We are passing through the DC area and found this place looking for dinner and live music.  We called and they don't have the live music yet but coming within a week or two as they are new.  That night we chose not to go, but thought the menu sounded interesting.  We stopped in today to catch the US world cup game before going hiking, as the menu sounded so interesting.  We had wings and fried chicken breast  (chicken strips) of both choices as our apps.  Don't order the pickels if you have an app, they are included.  The breading and sauces were great.  I lean towards the wings, but you can't go wrong either way.  I couldn't spell what I had, but it was a beef dish and my GF had the Tofu.  The serving sizes were large and reasonably priced.  I wish we were in town longer to go again, but it will be a definite stop on our next trip.  I can only imagine how great the dinners are.  Then with the live music this will be a home run!  Great Job!",
