The  approximately 30 foot cubic confines of Anthony's Bar is like something out of a suspense novel with Joe, the wizened bartender,  handling things with the appropriate aplomb of a master sommelier, gourmet, and someone who probably knows all the people who know where all the bodies are buried.  Without his defining presence, I seriously doubt the place would feel like the undiscovered local prize that it is.  I can't explain why on a Thursday evening there weren't more patrons in this casual bar associated with the more upscale restaurant, \"Tony's\", in the same building - food & wine all come from the same kitchen. Joe, the food, and the wine were all great.  Go for the good food & wine. Trust Joe to make you feel welcome, comfy, and confident you made the right choice for dinner. Although decor wise it was obviously from another time,  don't expect the meaningless market hype and positioning aimed at any particular generational demographic. It's just a surprisingly good place to go eat. Money well spent.",

Not what I asked. Joe replied, \"Let me make you a Manhatten.\" I loved it. He followed it up with a Negroni as a lead in for our main entree. Again  a perfect answer even if it was outside my usual choices. Our meals were impeccably prepared and served in an intimate and non-rushed pace. Overall, a great evening.

Anthony's is a great business lunch spot that also works well as a more casual, but fine dining restaurant.  Features some great flavorful sandwiches and entres.  The whole restaurant wraps around a massive bar and is fairly small.  Old-school service can be quite charming.  It's a special place where local business leaders and celebrities come to grab a quick, easy lunch that feels like a the grill at a country club. You can often order from the full Tony's menu for dinner, which is an amazing treat if you are a bit more casual--but want amazing food. Great spot!  While the share a kitchen, it's hard to compare Tony's and Anthony's. Tony's is absolutely first-class fine dining and Anthony's is a casual and much more low-key bar setting.  Anthony's is good for small groups 2-4-6, no kids. Great place to eat alone at the bar too--especially for lunch. A really unique spot in St. Louis. Location is right by the Arch in a newer office building. A gem!",
