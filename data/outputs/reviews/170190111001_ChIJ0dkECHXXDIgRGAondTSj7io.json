Multiple times, I saw an employee (possibly owner) that looks like she\u2019s in her 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s, not wearing her mask correctly. She had her mask under her chin, basically not wearing it at all. She even served my table with her mask under her chin. After seeing that, I don\u2019t even think they sanitize their tables or menus. I was disgusted to see a person I do not know at all serve me my food without a mask when she has been in contact with many different people. All I have to say is DO BETTER Masijta Grill.",

The nightmare started when I tried to call the phone number in the website which didn\u2019t ring and told me the mailbox was full. I found another number and with some difficulty placed my order. The menu has dishes by number but when I tried to order by number the person taking the order didn\u2019t know what numbers corresponded to. I was told the order would be ready in 10 minutes. That seemed pretty fast so I arrived 15 minutes later just to be sure. But when I arrived I was told I needed to wait another 10-15 minutes. I ordered a beer while I waited and they brought me one without asking what I wanted, which I thought was rather weird. Finally the food was ready but when I got home I realized that they had packed it poorly in leaky styrofoam containers. I had staining oil all over my car seat, my new boots and my table. When I opened the containers, two of the four orders were incorrect. We tried to make the best of a bad situation and eat what we had but the food was just okay- the noodle were rather dry and the bulgogi was greasy. To top it all off, the food was rather expensive. I will NEVER order from this place again.",

No meaningful difference, and they will start you with a huge amount of mandatory cheap meat anyway. 3. For Korean food, go to Star Karaoke instead, with good fried chicken, pancake, and service.  I used to frequent this place but will not visit again because of the disrespectful owner.  My friend reserved a table for 8 this May 2019 to celebrate graduation. 3 of our party did not appear on time, while the owner repeatedly asked us where they were and insisted that we call them. The owner eventually said to us, \"When you come to America, you need to learn the American way - be on time.\" I am Chinese, and so are my friends.  Admittedly, 3 of us were quite late - by 30 minutes perhaps. But even if so,  why should this have anything to do with our national origin? During my several years of stay in the US, not a single person has lectured me to \"learn the American way,\" with such an implication I found highly offensive: that since we are from China, we live by the inappropriate Chinese way that is inconsistent with the American social norm.  My previous visit to Masijta was not so pleasant either. There is another comment complaining Masijta making lunch price unavailable without updating the menu - the same happened to me. When my friend and I ordered, the server explained that lunch price was still available for my friend's order, but not for my order. He said the menu would be changed soon, and I said that's fine. However, when we had nearly finished, the server came again and told us that my friend wouldn't be getting the lunch price either, because that was their new price policy.  So here are my questions to the Masijta owner. First, you stopped offering lunch price without notifying customers on the menu - is this the \"American way,\" from your understanding?  Second, my friend was charged more, while your server had clearly told us that her order was eligible for lunch price - is this the \"American way,\" from your understanding?  To be fair, some food here is pretty good. But from next time I will go to Star Karaoke where the food is at least equally good, and I can have a much more comfortable experience.",

Although the menu specified that grills only require two people, the owner insisted we order more, saying we wouldn\u2019t have enough and that the grill service was costly for her if customers didn\u2019t order enough. It was wildly pushy and uncomfortable. As we expected, two orders were enough for the four of us.  Today, I ordered a meal through Grubhub for delivery. After receiving the wrong order, the owner refused to work with me to fix the situation. She kept repeating there was nothing I could do but order more food. The entire time she was also unapologetic.  The food is average at best, and rude behavior from the owner on more than one occasion makes it absolutely not worth it to go there again.",

However, when my friends and I went there today, the service was horrible. The servers never checked up on us. Not even once. We asked for more side dishes but never got any.  The worst part was, when we got our checks, we noticed that we were charged for dinner not lunch. When in the menu, it clearly said the lunch special was good for weekends too. We asked why this was the case, and the server said \"starting today, we don't do lunch specials on the weekends.\" When we said we should've been notified of this information before we ordered, the server simply said it was the owner's decision and was sorry then walked away.  We got to talk to the owner, and she just said she was sorry but still insisted that we had to pay the dinner price for lunch since they changed it starting today. When we asked about not changing the menu, she said the new menus are coming next week. When I said the price should've been changed starting next week, but she didn't respond. She said she was sorry but didn't seem like she really meant it.  I didn't go here that often anyways, but I know for certain that I will never be going back again.",

        "caption": "I am pretty new to Korean BBQ. So far, I have only had it at Star and once at Masijta. In both case we were a party of four that broadly bought the entire BBQ menu (or at least all the really fancy dishes on the menu). In case this makes a difference, we ate at Star late during a weekday evening (from about 8-10pm), and at Masijta during a Friday afternoon/early evening. Any reader should be aware, all I really care about is how good the food is-- price, atmosphere, service, etc. are all distant, secondary concerns for me, and right now, I'm focusing on finding the best Korean BBQ in around town (I like other Korean dishes as well, but I've found not nearly as much as the BBQ). The comparison between Star and Masijta BBQ isn't even a contest-- they aren't even playing in the same league. Star wins the battle of the BBQ hands down. The quality of the meat brought to the table was considerably better/better prepared at Star (Masijta's meats were all grisly and tough, Star's were all tender and succulent). Not only were the cuts of meat superior at Star, the presentation was far better. At Star, every bit of meat looked to have been carefully rolled/arranged on the platter in a artistic presentation, and each piece had obviously been given some TLC to ensure it was up to par. At Masijta, the meat came out in a massive gloppy pile (all the meats) with no care given to selection/preparation of the individual cuts or it's presentation. I only mention the presentation here because I think it speaks to how much/little care goes in to selecting the cuts of meat for the BBQ.  So, as far as Korean BBQ goes: Star gets 5 of 5 stars! ;) Every bit of meat was delicious! Masijta gets 2 of 5 stars. The quality of the meat wasn't even average-- it was below average. Of what was edible, it was tough and grisly. The pork cheek wasn't even edible.",
