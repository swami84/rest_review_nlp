The beef was fantastic, reminded me of Australian pies but with a different spice profile. The sauce was great also. Only complaint is there was a piece of chicken inside the beef saltena.  The chicha verde was fairly average. The best thing about it was the sauce. The chicken had a nice flavor. To their credit, it\u2019s hard to get chicken breast to be moist and contain flavor, and they got it right. The bread was super soggy, I threw it away.  Overall solid offerings, I think it\u2019s definitely worth a try.",
