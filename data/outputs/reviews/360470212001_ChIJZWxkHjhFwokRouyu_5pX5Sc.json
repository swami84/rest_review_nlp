When i was ordering my chicken and broccoli the lady said it was 5.50 but after the food she said it was $6 like i would forget what she said 10 minutes ago. I was a long time customer but after they changed owners this store has been getting worse and worse. Would not recommend AT ALL. There are more Chinese food restaurants nearby.",
