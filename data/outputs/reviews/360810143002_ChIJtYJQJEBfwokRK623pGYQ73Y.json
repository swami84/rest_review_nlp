Well we stopped in yesterday for lunch and a hookah...they just started opening at 2:00pm a few days earlier.  We were starving and couldn't wait to get something to eat...so we started with several appetizers...I can recommend everything I ate...all delicious. We started with: Fried Kibbeh fried cracked wheat stuffed with ground meat & onions - it was served with a Ranch \"like\" sauce - very tasty Falafel vegetable patties deep fried - delicious - Stuffed Grape Leaves, stuffed with rice, tomatoes, parsley, mint & olive oil, they were served warm and tasted magnificent. And Naturally we had hummus - there was warmed Pita for us to enjoy with the hummus - I really enjoyed all these appetizers. My friend and I shared a Lunch Entree - a Shish Kebab Sandwich, tender lamb grilled with onions, and peppers grilled in flatbread....served with fries DELICIOUS. Both my friend and I enjoy Hookah - so we had a Lemon Mint shisha and later enjoy another round of Blue Mist - GREAT HOOKAHS, the bowls are packed well and they continually replenish your coals as needed. I recommend this place - the Decor is very Morocco meets Dubai lounge.....a very friendly staff and just a cool place to hang out - I can't wait to go back",

The hot plates were really flavorfull, especially the \"lamb stew\" which I highly recommend. Portions are very big so can share and take home.

To start things off the scenery is very relaxing and homey. The minute you walk in and take a look at the comfortable furniture, decorations, lights, music and ambience you feel as if you're actually visiting someone's house in the heart of Beirut.  While most places in Steinway typically either have a nightclub setting or a very cheap recreation room sort of asthetic, you automatically feel at home with the way one feels welcome when one walks in. You can sit down - watch TV, gather and just relax listening to either classic Arabic tunes or whats going on in the media.  In regards to the staff - the owner Nabeel is one the most kindest and welcoming individuals anyone can ever meet upon entering his resteraunt, he runs the resteraunt as if he's running his own house and makes sure you feel welcome. In addition, he was many staff workers who are very kind and committed and also make sure to take care of whatever food you need - so you wont feel awkward or pressured by asking anything.  When it comes to the food - I truly ask you to take my word on this and say that whatever people have said in the past is something I personally haven't experianced.  The food is fresh and right off the fire and grill, the ingrediants are top quality and the drinks/deserts are often made locally as soon as you order. Take it from me - even something as simple as the Lentil soup will definently make you hungry for more and the Lamb chops, kebabs and various entrees are not to be underestimate - the best advice I usually give to newcomers is to order a mixed grill as you get a huge plate you can share with 2-3 people with a wide mix of grilled meat that comes with your choice of salad or fries - adding a side of hummus also doesnt hurt at all.  The hookah is also something to be greatly desired after. As of now, they have recruited this really brilliant young Algerian guy with a little top knot who makes the hookah fresh and its very much worth it. The hookah can last you for a long while, the quality is great and the price is half of what you pay at all these nightclub type of spots coming around. I personally love the Lemon or Lemont Mint Hookah but you have many different options and heads to choose from.  To sum it all up - if you're looking for a great spot to hang out with friends, have a date, family get together or even come down to a nice place where you can get your work done in a caf\u00e9 environment - I truly would and have reccomended this place in the time Ive come here.  Coming from someone who has tries hookah spots from Jamaica to New Jersey, Leyali Beirut is the spot - it may be a little pricy but you get your complete money's worth and time and always want to come back for more.  If you have any doubts or questions about this review, please feel free to comment or reach out to me as this is completely my honest opinion.",

The decor is warm and inviting, and the menu offers excellent traditional and Western-friendly fare.  Polite, obliging staff and great hookah top it off for a well-deserved five stars!  The owner, if you are fortunate enough to meet him, is a true gem of humanity.  Visit and discover for yourself....",

Secondly he don\u2019t know how to make hookah. No smoke no flavour. He just put more coals to increase smoke which just taste like burnt coals.

In all honesty the jokes were clever, and maybe a little amusing.  I say this as an African person who was the indirect subject matter of these \"black jokes\".  But the uncomfortable roar of laughter coming from the owners table as my party left Layali reminded me of how ugly those jokes can be.   Inhospitable.  Ma'salaam.",
