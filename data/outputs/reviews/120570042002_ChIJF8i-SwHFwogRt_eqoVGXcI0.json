Pre-COVID, I probably came here at least once a month, but this time around, I've been ordering on Uber Eats.  Starting with the Vegetable Spring Rolls, they were okay.  They didn't have much flavor to them and were a bit soggy on the inside.  They were alright, but not my favorite.  The Zukku Roll was pretty good.  There's A LOT going on with it, but between the sweet and savoriness of the eel sauce and spicy mayo on top, it worked really well.  It is a bit messy to eat, but I really enjoyed it.  The Godzilla Burrito was good as well, but not the best we've had from them.  The first burrito we had was their Flamin' Hot Cheeto burrito and I wish they'd bring that back as a full-time menu item.  There's just something about the balance between the crunchy, sweet inside of a sushi burrito with the spiciness and crunch of the Cheeto that we can't seem to get from their other burritos like that one.  Maybe we need to try some more customization to them.  Overall, I can't wait to go back and enjoy their food in the comfort of Armature Works and enjoy the hustle and bustle of everyone anxiously waiting in line for their food.  It's always a popular spot and their food echoes why.",

Was in a wwwk ago and the food and service were so bad that I watched many people returning their food as well as myself. They wanted me to wait to help the people in line and wait to get a refund, which they had difficulty in doing because I paid cash. Why should I have to wait....I already waited fir bad service and cold food. I wrote then an email explaining how I enjoy eating there but after a few poor experiences in the past I refused to pay the high prices fir the cold slow food. I thought they would have emailed me back with an apology or an explanation, I never received a response which leads me to believe that they simply don\u2019t care. I\u2019m almost certain that zukku is owned by the same proprietor of many of the other food In armature. Needless to say, I will not return or support this establishment l.",

I seemed those who had been there before were able to skip and bypass me simply because they had been there before and knew what to do and no one stopped to explain anything me as a first time customer.  My friend was as lost as I and was trying to ask for help whilst I observed two people and read the menu and figured it out before a third could skip us. It seems customer service is really only expected as a reaction but how can one be drawn in if they can't understand what they are looking at?",

The menu has several options to select from such as a sushi bowl or a sushi burrito however you can also choose to create your own. I had a poke bowl with tuna and salmon served over some greens and rice. My significant other had a sushi burrito with shrimp tempura. To drink we went with a Sapporo beer and the milk boba thai tea. Everything was fresh and delicious.  There was a bit of a line while ordering however they have a pretty good system down. Once you place your order you are given one of those light up pagers that let you know when your food is ready and someone is there ensuring you pick up the correct order. It was pretty busy when we were there but located a place to sit that was close by. This is definitely a place to check out if you like sushi. I'll definitely be back to check out other items they have!",

This is just that.  I'm giving only 3/5 starts here today because this poke is EXPENSIVE for what it is. The brown rice is extra, the meats are limited in portion (very few raw options, most are cooked), and then only 3 toppings. I usually like to load up my poke bowls with lots of veg and toppings in order to supplement the poke and make it more of a salad bowl.  However, I did like the roasted mango topping that I got, and the fact that the tuna was fresh (I got raw tuna and salmon). The ordering is pretty streamline as well because you just mark what you want on a laminated menu, and hand it to the cashier.  They hand you a buzzer/pager when you pay because they take a while to prepare it even though its just down the buffet line to assemble. I'm not sure why they do that.  Probably would choose to explore another option at this food venue.",

One of the chefs asked if he could try a bite. When he did, he agreed that it was not fresh. I expected that, at that point, they might offer me a substitute fish or even a refund, but they did neither. They simply returned to work on preparing food. I\u2019m not sure whether they actually disposed of the remaining tuna or not, but I was very disappointed in how they managed (or didn\u2019t manage as the case may be) the issue. What could have easily have been addressed was not, and I will be reluctant to eat there in the future, which is a real disappointment.",

On the left is the Zukku Roll with hints of citrus - in the middle is the Hamachi Dragon with jalape\u00f1o that was the perfect amount of heat and then the Shrimp Volcano where they use chunks of tempura shrimp instead of crab in the middle. Highly recommend!",

I will try this place again after I have been through the other stalls.",
