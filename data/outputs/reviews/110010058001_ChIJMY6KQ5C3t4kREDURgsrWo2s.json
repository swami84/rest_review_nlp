Do not get me wrong, I am glad I went, and if you are a food enthusiast with the cash to spare, it is worth a trip at least once. However, I would not necessarily go back to minibar when there are so many other highly rated restaurants in the DC area to try. Many of the snack sized dishes are innovative, fun AND delicious. My fav was the Beet Pizzelle with Ostera Caviar - perfect combo of earthy, crisp, salty, and creamy that explored both texture and flavor. The use of an alpine cheese that I could eat buckets of was also appreciated in several of the snacks. But overuse of white truffle frankly clouded a few dishes that would have been perfectly fine without the cloying shavings. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like me some truffle, but in the Unagi Salmorejo, it took away from the ocean-y brine of the sea urchin. I think truffle gets overused in a lot of fine dining settings as an expensive \u201cwow\u201d factor - this was definitely the case with minibar. The gelatinous \u201cbeans\u201d of concentrated flavor were used several times, and while at first I was really  impressed, it started to get old. The \u201cGigante Bean\u201d was my least favorite snack, as it overplayed the novelty of the wiggly bean of concentrated flavor and basically are out tasting like a weird blob of bacon fat. In comparison, the following snack of Panceta Iberico and Ostera Caviar nailed the flavor combo of pork fat and salt in a more traditional presentation. Food aside, the service is fantastic. The orchestration of presenting dishes was spot on, not too performance-y, just the right amount of elegant presentation to augment the dishes. The staff is all young, attractive, and have great skin. Seriously, what toner do you all use? Capping off the evening at barmini is fun and more social that the intimate setting of minibar. It\u2019s worth going light on the drinks during dinner so you can end the evening with one of the many delectable drinks at barmini. If anything, I would probably seek to go to barmini again over minibar.",

It's hard to say whether or not it was worth the money as I graciously had my meal paid for, but it places you basically on the frontier of what is possible with food.

I would recommend getting the wine pairing even if you don't drink, the wines are incredible and if you don't drink they serve you non alcoholic mock tails made from fresh juices that were a flavor experience unto itself, the pairings are by far the most clever aspect of an incredibly clever meal.",

The food was overly complicated for the sake of being complicated. Unlike other multi-course gastronomic extravaganzas like those served at the French Laundry (which focuses on amazing ingredients and organic textures), Minibar takes the food out of the art. They leave you with something that looks amazing, is extraordinarily unique, but quite frankly is not real food. Lastly, I barely had to chew the entire evening... Almost, everything was served in a gelatinous, pureed or frozen liquid form. With every course I hoped for something to actually bite into. I had high hopes for Minibar, but Ieft feeling as though the experience was not about eating delicious food and more about being wowed by how ingredients could be technically processed into something else.",

I managed to get an early seating at 5:45 but I did not sit at the bar until after 6. That was fine as I was offered a drink and sat in the waiting room, where they provided a pre-meal snack. I was seated with a party that was celebrating a birthday. The bar when full has room for 12 people then there is that one table so the room is quiet enough to talk to your seatmates. The myriad of dishes are all artistic, in the presentation and the combination of flavors. There is a heavy use of nitrogen in the creation of a lot of dishes and non-alcoholic drinks. It is all very interesting. At the end, I was moved over to the barmini side for dessert. There I was able to marvel at the creativity and showy-ness of that side. I only gave 4 stars because I wish I could give 4.5. I might still be in shock due to the price and I had a far better experience at another 2 Michelin starred DC restaurant.",

My boyfriend surprised me with a reservation here to celebrate my birthday and my acceptance into graduate school. It's definitely an experience that you want to reserve for a super special occasion (unless you are loaded) since one could easily spend $500 per person after a wine pairing and tips. My boyfriend had made this reservation about one month in advance, which seems to be the norm. However the couple that sat next to us got lucky and was able to make a reservation about 2 days before.  When you first arrive you are seated in a cozy common area where you will be treated with champagne. When everybody in your seating time has arrived you will be escorted to the table. From the moment you are seated, expect to be surprised and impressed with the highest level of service and most exquisite cuisines.  From there you will embark on this culinary journey. There were so many plates and all of them were amazingly pleasant to the taste buds. My favorites the fish-shaped biscuit made of seaweed and caviar, the sashimi garnished with salmon roe, the kimchee mussel shells, cotton candy cake, the gummy caterpillars, the bourbon peanuts, the krispy kreme donuts. I won't go into detail because the plates just have to be experienced.  Every dish and wine pairing is explained and if you have further questions every body behind your behind will be able to answer any of them. All of them are culinary geniuses.  I know that going to minibar may seem quite pricey, but if you have an appreciation for the culinary arts then I would highly recommend it!",

If it cost $100 bucks, I'd feel a lot differently about it, but at $400, I'm not a happy camper. Go to Komi instead.",

The experience starts when you arrive and are seated for a cocktail in barmini.  Once led into the room for seating at Jose's table you are brought drinks and the first course.  The night we went we had 26 courses with 8 different wine pairings.  I enjoyed all the courses and wine choices as well.  What I noticed was each course had very specific ingredients which you could taste separately from each other and at different times while chewing.  The flavors are not all muddled together.  After dinner we moved over to Barmini for drinks to finish out the evening.  We arrived at 7:10pm and left at 1:30am, so almost 6.5 hours in total.  it's expensive but worth it for the unique food and experience.",

I was very skeptical when invited to a dinner by the head chef, but my father insisted.  I was greeted by a warm, flower scented towel; a great relief after walking many blocks from a difficult parking spot to find in DC. We were formally sat down and a few minutes later started the dinner. But here's the thing, It really wasn't a dinner,it was more of an experience. An experience of an incredible amount of detail and flavors. From food trickery and an edible muscle shell, to a frozen chocolate puck being served to you by hand, it wasn't at all a meal.  Although I did not feel full at all after partaking in all of the many, many portions, I did feel that I tried some of the most interesting food I have had in a long time. The one thing I could suggest is a main dish that I could actually take a few bites out of. The menu constantly changes and this is a good thing. For around $200 you are paying for an experience like no other that you would find in DC.",

Conducting a handful of sous chefs in what could only be called a symphony of culinary timing. To say everything tasted, looked, and was presented perfectly would be to do Jose's staff a disservice. This meal went beyond exceptional. We ordered the Celebration pairing, a nightlong endless experience of bubbly, custom paired to each of the 26ish courses with absolute attention to detail by the most lovely sommelier, Melissa. She not only paired the perfect champagne and sparkling wine for each course, she also took great care to describe perfectly how it would pair, what region the bubbly came from, and how it was made. She had a deep knowledge of food and wine, and it paid off. This was a perfect night. If you're on the fence about spending the money, don't be. It is well worth it.",

It is something everyone should experience once in their lives and I will remember it forever.  Not your grandmother's cooking.",
