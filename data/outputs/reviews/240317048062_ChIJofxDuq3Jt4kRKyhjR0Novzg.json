Two regrets - they didn't have roomali roti yet so gotta go again to have that and didn't have any drinks this time around! But I highly recommend the MoCo Indian food lovers to try this restaurant!",

The Amritsari fish and chicken tikka was cooked well. The phirni had a nice texture and the aamras halwa was nice. I will definitely order again :)",

Decided to get take out for Sunday night dinner and the calls were rolling in. Got the $16 tandoori murgh. Delicious moist white meat chicken thigh  marinated overnight in yogurt, saffron and aromatic spices. Delicious! Tons of soft basmati rice with these orders. Also picked the $14 chilli crab masala crab meat prepared with mushrooms and onions scrumptious. The $3 garlic black pepper naan was fluffy and tasty!!!!  LOOK at my great pics and give them a try!!!! Gonna be a welcome addition to Bethesda.",

The saag panner tasted so fresh and organic and the butter naan melted in my mouth. We also had the tender baby goat curry which had unmatched rich and bold flavors. Virraaj will definitely be a sensational buzz in Bethesda. Highly recommended!",

The flavors of the food were soooo good and the best part - it tasted fresh! You could tell they used quality ingredients. We had the lamb lajaawab, Delhi butter chicken, paneer makhan masala, naan, rasmalai, and the phirni. Everything was delicious. The decor is beautiful. I love the black and gold combo. Prices are really good for downtown Bethesda. Service was great. The only thing missing were heaters for the outside space. I\u2019m still full from my meal there, but I\u2019m already thinking about when I will go next!",
