My friend and I decided to eat here for dinner one night because of the high reviews and vicinity to his home. We were told to seat anywhere. We had waited long enough that when the waitress asked for our drink orders, we were ready to order food. When I asked if I could decrease the spice level by one degree on a dish, the waitress told me I can always add a creamy sauce if I can't handle the spice. Another table then sat down after we recieved our drinks. However they got their food and left before us. And once our drinks were served, we no longer saw our waitress again for the rest of the night. No one bothered to ask us how our food was, no one checked up on us, and no one refilled our drinks. I had to go up to the bar behind me because my food was too spicy for my liking. After asking the bar and getting my drink refilled, another waiter came up to our table and passively aggressively filled my friends drink and left an extra bottle of water at our table without saying anything. Basically we could not get any service unless we specifically called out for a random waiter. I don't understand why it took over 15 minutes to get our bill when there were only a total of 5-6 tables in total in the whole restaurant 3-4 wait staff. We do not plan to come here again, nor would we recommend this restaurant to anyone else. If you're craving Indian food, I recommend trying someplace else.",

After work I came in with a small group of friends. Over the course of few hours we tried just about every drink on their speciality cocktail menu and as well as the food from the starter menu. Everything was so incredibly good! I can\u2019t express that enough.  Everything came out quickly and correctly. Additionally, we got to meet the owner and she couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming. She was down to earth and friendly and more than happy to answer any questions about the entrees or the restaurant.  If happy hour is your thing. Cusbah has an all-day happy hour every Thursday. I\u2019ll definitely have to come back to check that out.  The restaurant its has a great atmosphere with very cool lighting over the bar and great upbeat music. There is inside and outside seating. Finally, the restaurant is well maintained and taken care of. Hopefully I get the chance to come back soon. Thanks for changing my perspective on Curry food!",

The spice is lower than I prefer,  I would say there really wasn't any spice, but I understand catering for your clientele. I don't know why Cusbah would receive a bad rating, everything was wonderful- we ate chicken korma, garlic naan (2)\ud83d\ude44, and veggie samosas,  washed down with old ox cherry draft and pinot grigio. While we were here on a Friday evening, the takeout orders were crazy. Do yourself the favor and try Cusbah!!  UPDATE JULY 2019: Sooo did we have a few free days and decided to return to D.C. just b/c of Cusbah's garlic naan - yes! Another visit, even greater meals! This time we had the chicken vindaloo and butter chicken, and way too much garlic naan, but who's counting?! These dishes were amazing and the vindaloo brought the heat, but wasn't overpowering even more so if you have the raita on the side. Thanks again for another great visit!",

I would encourage them to rethink their \u201corder food at the bar\u201d service. We were HUGE supporters of their sister-restaurant at Eastern Market, Capitol Hill Tandoori, and we\u2019re hugely disappointed when it closed but we\u2019ve been also disappointed in the direction that Cusbah is going. If you are going to limit your personal table service and present a limited menu, then make sure you at least have ALL. the items from your limited menu. We will try them again to see if they have improved.",

I don't usually give out poor reviews, and safe for the delicious naan basket (the garlic naan was incredible), this place would've gotten one star.

Honestly, dont want to waste more time writing this. Really bad service, the food took FOREVER to come out despite the fact that I'm confident none of the food was \"made to order\" (Indian food rarely is).",

Cusbah is GOOD (I mean, what Indian restaurant is not!? - note: the place is mostly Indian), really not pricy, they feed you for real (not \u00ab\u00a0nouvelle cuisine\u00a0\u00bb style with three beans saying hello to two mushrooms and a half pecan), most of the time, I have to take leftovers in boxes, but the best is the service, what is to me the most important . I come here maybe once a month, and they remember me, they know better than me what wine I had last time, and how I liked it. Ok, stop reading this and make a reservation now! I take all my good friends there (if you are one of them and we haven\u2019t been there yet, be patient or text me and we go tonight! \ud83d\ude01)",

People use cleaning products that mask the good restaurant smells, like windex, right by my food.  The bartender and his playlist were the best thing about this restaurant. He was warm and welcoming and was clearly very close to the regulars, giving them hugs etc. And he was playing a Portis Head type playlist.  Our waiter however, I don't think was actually the waiter it seemed like maybe he was the barback or some other staff member who's not familiar with customer service. He got one of our orders wrong, we said nothing, the table next to us sent theirs back. We got Chicken Tikka Masala instead of Chicken Tikka. My order of Baingan Bhurta was ok as was our friend's Saag Paneer. The food was OK, very rich, but it's hard to remember it favorabley while you're downing a bottle of tums on your way home. I'd ordered a glass of wine, the glass was coated in food stains and fingerprints, I was going to order another along with dessert but our waiter ghosted on us.  There were two other babies when we were visiting and our toddler enjoyed flirting with the bartender and eating all the rice that came with our meals- so that's a bonus.  Overall nice ambiance, food was too heavy, but the windex smell nixed this place from my \"to return\" list.",

The summer weather was nice so my girl and I opted for outdoor seating on the covered patio which sits right on the northwest corner of H and 12th Street NE.  On the H street corridor, there's always plenty to see... whether you want to or not. But I digress. Our server was AMAZING!!! I wish I remembered her name to give her a personal shout out, but my brain fog has kicked it. In any case, she was really on point without being fake or pushy about us placing out order immediately. She made great food recommendations and was very attentive to us while serving other groups in the restaurant as well. The food was really flavorful. The theme of Asian spices was delivered. All our food was tasty and came out hot. I will definitely be back if only to order more food. The crowd is a nice mix of people and there's nothing pretentious about the atmosphere. A solid experience all the way around.",

I usually ONLY get lamb vindaloo when eating Indian cuisine, but I was going to dinner later so stuck to the appetizer, but wanted to try the vindaloo sauce with the naan. Chicken tikka was good. Naan was quartered and served piping hot and fresh. Vindaloo sauce was not what I'm used to. It was much thicker and more red with red chili flakes visible to the eye. It was okay enough, and very spicy, but not a traditional vindaloo, hence 4 starts instead of 5. I would come back and try other menu items.",

Whatever we asked for is either passed the time of them serving that menu or they do not serve such. To make matters worse; the Owner was the one serving use and she was the one telling us these \"can;t dos\".My friends and I (we made a decision to go to different Indian Restaurant each week) made a pack that we WILL NOT go there again. But the new General Manager (Hakim) over head the discussion and came over to apologize. He  explained that he had just taken the position of a GM; that we should give him one month to put the restaurant in order and try the  place again. He gave us his cellphone number to call him when we are ready after the one month. I promised me that we would ( I am the organizer of the weekly restaurant hopping). I am giving Cusbah Restaurant 2 Stars only because  of Hakim's apology.  The interesting is that the food was very tasty and well prepared but the service sucked.",

She was very hospitable and warm and went beyond her duties to make each guest happy.  The server/bartender had a packed house and still made everyone happy.  My son Josh ate 90% of his food and took the rest home, which he ate 5 minutes after we got in the house.  I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.

Thankfully the portions are large enough to ensure leftovers for later in your hotel room, because in a couple hours it's a guarantee that you'll be craving it again. The service was also great. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive, and the manager, Nico, made it a point to come to my table to chat and welcome me back to his restaurant even though I'd only been there once before.

We had reserved a table in advance for 8 people. They had a table for 6 where they squeezed in extra 2 chairs on a day when their cooling wasn't working very well. Needless to say it was hot in there. Their service is a little slow since it took them more than 15 min to just serve the water and another 10 before they could even take our order. But you would not be disappointed by the food. Would definitely visit this place again but this time with a smaller group without a doubt.",

However, the food and service were disappointing. The food is farthest from authentic Indian I've had in DC. The rice wasn't that good and the naan mediocre. The chicken tikka masala was too tomato based and if you can see the red on the red peppers, you know it's not authentic. If you want a VERY American version of Indian food, go here. If you want REAL Indian food, go to Rasika in Chinatown.",

It was a rainy night and I knew exactly what I had a taste for but definitely didn't want to drive to Gaithersburg  for some good Indian cuisine. I drove past this place plenty of times and figured this would be a great night to try it out...  The food: I ordered the Paneer Makhni and my mother ordered the Palak Paneer... It was very good and all the spices hit the right notes. =)  The drinks: I bartend so of course I wanted to try the cocktails. We ordered \"The Cusbah\", \"Jasmin\" and \"Silk Road\". Presentation was good, nice and simple but the \"Jasmin\" was very disappointing as far as taste...had a horrible cough syrup after taste. But the other two cocktails were awesome.  The ambiance: it had a nice feel to the place, I loved the spice filled jars but the seating was very tight. I like the idea of an intimate setting but I felt a little too close as if my elbows were on the next persons table.  Overall with a few cocktail tweaking and seating rearrangement I feel that this is the place to be if your looking for some good South Asian cuisine in the DC area.",

The food here is fantastic. It's a Pakistani and North Indian cuisine restaurant, and the food from the buffet - samosas, chicken tikka masala, naan, curries, and sauces - were so good I had to have seconds.  I would definitely come back on a normal night for dinner. I know this place also has great happy hours, jazz bands, and DJs.
