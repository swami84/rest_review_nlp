I walked in and was shocked there was a very large party sitting in the back way more than 10 people. They were talking so loud and screaming we asked the waiter if we could move the corner table by the window. The food came and as me and my fianc\u00e9 were trying to talk over the loud noise and music blasting. One of the girls walk over and ask if her friends could take a pic next to the area we were which wasn\u2019t very big. I thought to myself \u201c  ummmm we are in a pandemic\u201d but i said no problem since I didn\u2019t want to ruin their time. After 20 mins of picture taking one girls started moving backwards to try and take a good pic of her friend and nearly backed into our table. Mind you we were the only table eating and took up 5 percent of the space on the restaurant. I expected a manager or someone who worked at the restaurant to walk over and apologize for the inconsideration of the ladies but instead the bartender started blasting meek mill and I\u2019m assuming these girls were in a sorority because they started dancing in formation making a screeching noise. I couldn\u2019t even enjoy the rest of my meal and it looked like no one who worked at the restaurant cared. When the waiter brought the bill, I explained how inconsiderate this was and he responded he knows, he said the party was for 10 and way more people came. We were so annoyed and left. Definitely will not be returning. I can\u2019t even remember how the food tasted with all the extra stuff that was going on.",

We started off with mimosas and coffee and they were all great. Since it was small we definitely got attention from our waiter who kept the drinks coming! We ordered their biscuits which did not disappoint and I was a little sad I didn't get my own side of them. I had their french toast and bacon for brunch which was good. The bacon was a bit overcooked but maybe it was an off day? The removal of the star really comes from the vents blowing out what seemed like chunks of dead skin or just little flakes? Thankfully this happened towards the end of our meal. I'd still recommend this place! We brought up the vent issue and they were quick to turn them off to avoid it from continuously happening.",

They have a good variety of food, southern inspired, and decently priced for their portions.  We came on a rainy day but to my surprise it was still lively. The atmosphere is chill yet fun and the staff is very friendly and professional. I was left on hold for over 10 mins the first time I called to make a reservation but I'm happy I gave this place a shot because i will be returning.",

We celebrated my fianc\u00e9\u2019s birthday by having a birthday brunch with 12 people.  Setting this brunch was such a delightful process by emailing Nikoa and Brian about the number of people, requesting a prix fix menu, and letting them know the event we were celebrating.  The overall ambiance and decor of the place were very inviting, vintage, spacious, and clean.  The clientele there had a very nice energy and positive vibe.  The food was terrific! Based on the people that attended, they had the shrimp and grits, eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, and southern breakfast. I had the smoked salmon benedict and it was very tasty.  Next, the drinks were on point! Most bottomless brunches offer the water down orange juice and champagne \u2013 NOT Ruby\u2019s. The Rum punch packed a punch, the Mimosa was strong, and the Peach Bellini was a hit! The Service was extremely attentive.  Thank you Nikoa and Brian for such a wonderful experience. Look forward to our next visit.",
