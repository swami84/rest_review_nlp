The hibiscus berry had lime included which over powered the tea as a whole. The body booster tea was very strong, beware if you are not a fan of turmeric. The spice level is high. Overall, I think the quality of tea is great.  The server was kind and sweet. There was only one person serving the entire space, so we had to wait a lot longer to get her attention to pay and was only asked about what we thought of the tea when we had finished. Had someone come by to follow up with us, I would have requested a bit more sugar in the hibiscus berry tea.  THE TIME IT TOOK TO GET OUR TEA WAS A BIT RIDICULOUS....... On top of this, the amount we paid for two 24oz tea vs the amount we received a bit steep. Additionally, there were no food options to pair with the tea which would have added to the experience. For this reason, I would give this place 3.5 stars.",

On our drive home my mom, daughter and I enjoyed our cups of tea.  My mother also stated her stomach felt much better.  I was glad in an era where a majority of the mom and pop stores in Harlem are closed this store possessed the flavor, professionalism and warmth of the old Harlem I was used to.

Their selection of teas is extensive and they have the knowledge to match. Everyone is very friendly, too. They had the kitchen closed when I went but I got to see the outside seating out back and I resolved to be back after they'd opened that up.  Overall, this may have been the highlight of my short trip to Harlem. Will definitely return.",

I had a little time to kill before the doors opened for a nearby event that I planned to attend. So I decided to find a nearby cafe to sit in before the event. I was delighted to discover Serengeti Teas and Spices.  I went inside and ordered my tea in a to-go cup. I\u2019m a slow tea drinker and the 40 minutes I needed to kill would not have been enough time for me to finish, so to be safe, I ordered it to go. I also purchased some additional teas to enjoy at home.  After my order was ready, I went to sit down and read. After a few minutes, an employee approached me telling me that I could not stay because of the fact that I ordered my tea in a to-go cup. I have never encountered such a policy in my decades of dining. Plus, the venue wasn\u2019t even crowded. There were also no signs indicating this rule of theirs.  I explained why I purchased my tea in a to-go cup, but he insisted that I could not stay. So, I didn\u2019t go back and forth with him. I just grabbed my things and left. And now I\u2019m sitting outside at a bus stop, waiting for my event to begin and barely able to enjoy my tea. Off of sheer principle, I have no intentions on returning here again.",

For those who have never been, I believe what makes these teas so much better than the rest is the fact that they are infused with exotic spices, flowers, and dried fruits that give the teas its bold and exciting flavor. If you are a tea fan, you MUST try this tea. If you are not a tea fan, you still MUST try this tea because you will become a tea fan. It truly is a treat worth the visit!!...Now, I will have to admit, the venue isn't the most spacious (but this is New York after all) but the ambiance is cozy and adds to the experience. Also side note, in case the owner sees this review, I've had mixed customer service experiences over my visits. There is a gentleman who works there who is extremely helpful and engaging. He lends insight and history about the teas as well as the establishment as a whole. The lady employees, on the other hand, were dry and less inviting. Just an observation that I wanted to share.  Update: Although the website says that they close at 7:30, when I visited yesterday at 7:15, they had already fully closed up shop (lights out and not a soul in sight). Needless to say, I was disappointed. I removed one star from my review.",
