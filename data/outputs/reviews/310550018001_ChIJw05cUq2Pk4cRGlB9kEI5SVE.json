The bavarian cream, oreo, and cajeta churros were crispy crunchy, delicious, and each one tasted very different! The asada/steak burrito was huge, but more importantly, filled with delicious ingredients and came with two yummy salsas that tasted fresh and homemade. We can't wait to go back to try the tortas, tacos, and tamales! Great prices for excellent food.",

Fantastic, authentic Mexican food and oh my churros and elotes! Seriously, some of the best we've had, not only in Omaha but anywhere. They are SUPER awesome and we can feed the whole family very reasonably. This place will be a regular for us. They're usually near 72nd and Dodge but they're good about updating their Facebook on their location and open times. Thanks for the great food!",
