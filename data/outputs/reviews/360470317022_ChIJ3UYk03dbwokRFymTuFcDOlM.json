The sides, roasted potatoes and rice, were delicious.  * Short rib sandwich combo - It was really good. The beef was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the quinoa salad on the side. I did not like the cole slaw only because it did not taste fresh. I had to scrape it off my sandwich. And I couldn't eat the side order of it.  * Vegetable Terrine - It is absolutely delicious! It was my favorite thing ordered.  * Cornbread (comes with the combos) - Delicious. Moist and flavorful.  * Bread pudding - Omgnesss. Delicious!  I would recommend this place and can't wait to return.",

I\u2019ve been in quarantine, and am on the Keto diet, so I\u2019ve been sampling many non-breaded chicken places. Out of about six places in Brooklyn all found on Dinner Dash, this place has the tastiest, most moist chicken, amazing sauces, and really great sides. Many people seem to love the collard greens\u2014those aren\u2019t for me, but the fried broccoli and cauliflower are very specifically seasoned, with a perfected texture. They are quite fatty sides, but beside a lean meat like chicken, it\u2019s great. Apparently the best thing on their menu is the corn bread, but that is very not Keto, so I haven\u2019t tried.  Thanks guys, for helping me stay Keto even during quarantine. The only thing I\u2019d like to know is, what\u2019s in the cauliflower (curious about carbs), and also, why only Wednesday????? THAT DISH IS LIFE ;)",

Now I did see the negative reviews but I decided to give them a chance. I ordered the quarter chicken with 2 sides which were The fried cauliflower and the quinoa and a portion of cornbread. The fried cauliflower was horrendous. It was super soggy. Quinoa was okay\u2014 a bit on the dry side. The cornbread was tasty which was the best part of the whole meal. The chicken was tasty but I was surprised at how salty it was. For half the price, I could\u2019ve just ordered from my local Dominican spot. Maybe it was a fluke meal? Don\u2019t know but probably not ordering from them again.",

It really was  the only redeeming aspect to the rest of my dinner though... While the chicken, roasted potatoes, and greens were all cooked perfectly, compared to the \ud83c\udf3d \ud83c\udf5e, everything else thst came with my dinner overall just tasted mostly bland, or under-salted & under-seasoned. Definitely would still recommend  enjoying  any of their combo dinners from here sometime! (Like next time you're too busy or tired to cook yourself...)

Comes wih a big chunk of short rib, a heap of their special rice, daily interesting sides, dat cornbread and side sauce! It\u2019s so hearty and delicious. Feels like restaurant quality comfort food so at about $17 for the price, worth. I\u2019m moving out of this neighborhood and won\u2019t miss it but one thing I will miss are these dinner combos!
