Things restaurant week is not for : dumbing down offerings or compromising on service, etc... Just to get people through the door.  We got the second for sure. Even with a reservation, we were seated after almost a 35 minute wait,and even then we had to grab the host who I think had forgotten about us. From there, took another 45 minutes to get the first course. It was... unremarkable. Then came the creamy pasta course (is this a French restaurant?) which was super salty and uninspired. Then our dessert came, and the runner asked if we were sure when we mentioned the mains hadn't come yet... wrong questions bro. Two of our party finally got the \"Half Duck a l'orange\" - classic French! Impossible to get wrong... But it was really only a sad reheated quarter chicken, and different parts for different dishes even. Manager came after we paid to offer drinks but it was too little too late. Overall 3+ hours and a good story?  Needs to find a chef who loves and appreciates French cuisine and can carry that on to a plate - or go European in general?  Second star is for the host /manager /owner who would be played by Stanley Tucci - he was super hospitable.",

The shrimp app he raved about was out of this world excellent. The scallops entree is 5 star as well. The La Davina Casati is a light, crisp drink and is a must.  The bad: takes a long time between ordering your drink and receiving it. I mean a long time! The lamb chops although cooked to the perfect temperature had zero flavor. The steak frites, we asked the waiter to cook it to the temperature the chef reccomends. When it came out it was way over cooked. It was just a dried mess, absolutely terrible. The blue cheese dipping sauce for the fries that came with steak frites, I wanted to bottle up and take home with me.  So there was some good and bad. Granted it was only the 2nd night open. So I would definitely go back after a few months for them to work out the kinks. They have an upstairs cigar lounge (yeah!). They also have an upstairs space for party rental. Awesome space so walk up and check it out.  Bill was not super expensive. 2 couples with drinks, app and entrees $244 plus tip.",

The elegant, eclectic atmosphere makes one feel at home as soon as you cross the draped threshold. The service is impeccable. You are greeted at the door, your coat is taken, and you are seated quickly. I sat at the bar (seats were comfortable), and was greeted immediately by David, who's warm welcome (and willingness to explain the items on the menu to a south side city boy) made me feel even more at ease. The menu can be daunting for those not prone to frequenting fine dining establishments. I chose a Chardonnay (With David's blessing) and the young lady hosting for the evening recommended the Shrimp Jovan. The food and wine were both great, as to be expected for the price. What was equally as impressive, in my opinion, was the weight and style of the silverware! Alongside the meal came outstanding service. Borderline Opulence (For a great price).  Kathryn and Jason were gracious hosts, and utterly fabulous. \"Whisping\"  through the restaurant intent on making every detail perfect for their guests. Every inch of this space is immaculate, every detail receiving as much attention as their guests. Fantastic experience. Best of luck! I will be back very soon!",
