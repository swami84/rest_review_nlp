Not sure if that means most of their customers speak their language, but only means that YOU should go there now! He was super cool and accommodated my request to split a single meal into 2 takeout containers.  After arriving and being told my food was still being made fresh (woo), he handed me my bag, genuinely thanked me for supporting the business during the pandemic, and let me know they kindly gave me almost 2 full servings of biriyani due to my request. I was delighted, and even more so after trying it! It was amazing. Can\u2019t wait to go back. These guys have delicious food, and are super cool/nice.",

The food was out of this world. We usually compare food to what we've had in India, and thus far this is the closest yet. The meat samosa was so flavorful and fried to perfection. The tandoor mix included very juicy chicken and perfectly flavored moist kabob. The garlic naan was large and so fresh. Way better than the average place. We also tried the lamb, chicken, and shrimp tacos. Wow! Who knew tortilla tasted so good with Tikka masala (which also was so satisfying). For the first time I had a mango lassi where you appreciate the yogurt as well as mango fruit pieces. And to top it off, the mango cheesecake is so decadent and you can appreciate it is home made. Thank you Tandoor Char House for treating us like family and feeding us food so good we forgot we're not in India!!",

The complimentary basket of some kind of Indian bread served with three types of dipping sauce were exceptionally outstanding. The lamb biriyani with well-seasoned, tender lamb meat cooked in the basmati rice to perfection was juiciness and flavorful, even though the kick from the heat was not for everyone to handle.

We got the chaat fries, mutter paneer tikka masala, and chicken biryani to share and they were all amazing. The chaat fries were perfectly crisp and curly, the curry had a really good, smooth flavor (with unlimited rice!), and the biryani was a HUGE pile of rice with amazing spices layered in - biryani was definitely big enough for two people to share as one dish.  Our servers were also so great - they were always coming to check in on us and were super friendly and generous. Really great, cozy atmosphere!  And the mango cheesecake definitely is reason enough to stop by - super fluffy, light, perfect balance of sweet and tart. One of our servers (who I think may be the owner?) said he developed the recipe with one of the chefs and it\u2019s made in house.",

Small and simple, not a trendy restaurant, with a very good menu , lots of choice ,everything we tried was absolutely delicious. It is a type of restaurant that makes a difference. Just wonderful Indian food great lamb ,chicken ,and vegetarian plates. The service is remarkable friendly and just perfect plus this is a BYOB restaurant. The portions are huge. By far , this is one of the best Indian restaurants we tried anywhere. It is also very popular as a take out or orders (the phone almost doesn\u2019t stop ringing)  Thanks! Joe and Francois",

The Sardharia brothers go above and beyond to ensure their customers are happy and enjoy their meal. So when I was planning my Indian/Muslim wedding recently, I did not hesitate to reach out to Tandoor Char House for their catering services. Faraz, the catering manager, was a pleasure to work with. He was responsive to calls and emails, attentive to detail, and customized a menu that worked for us and our budget. He went above and beyond, offering his staff to serve the wedding cake. The day of the event, he worked tirelessly to ensure the buffet looks great and was always topped up. The food was DELICIOUS - all of our guests commented on the quality of the food, the rich flavors, and how much they enjoyed it. If you are looking for Indian food for your event, I highly highly recommend Tandoor Char House. The service is impeccable and the quality of food surpasses all other Indian food caterers in Chicago (in my humble opinion).",

The price was also really decent, I've been to a few restaurants in the north west suburbs which serve not so good food at a higher price. I'm definitely looking forward to coming here again which a bigger group of friends or family. I was here with a friend and we ordered mutter paneer tikka masala with a naan basket and a mango cheesecake (must have) and it was good enough for the two of us. Also, they make their paneer (cheese) in house which is not what most of other Indian restaurants take time to do. Would really recommend trying it out!",

We both ordered the tandoori chicken wrap on garlic naan which was not only huge in size but amazing in flavor. We ended with their in-house mango cheesecake- to die for!

The representative said that there was nothing they could do. Here I am supposed to provide food for 15 people and was not given any notice until the food was supposed to be delivered. The customer service was unprofessional and still remains un-resolved. I would not recommend using Tandoor for any catering engagements.",

The food here is definitely authentic and delicious and meets the standards of any critical Indian connoisseur.  The vegetables pakoras are a little different in terms of how they are traditionally prepared but it's good non the less. The tandoori chicken that comes on a sizzling plate is so flavorful and aromatic that you will want to order a second one. The assorted naan basket is a nice way to try the various naan breads such as garlic, cheese, and plain. This place does not short change you on chutneys, including the homemade pickles for condiments. You want more, just ask.  Another plus for this establishment is you can bring your own wine or alcoholic beverages as it is a BYOB. The staff is more than happy to keep to keep your drinks chilled. Speaking of the staff, they are all really friendly, jovial, and professional. We had a good time here and enjoyed every single dish.",

We love this family-owned spot with recipes you can tell have been built upon for generations. The Masala sauce is out of this world and the achar is perfect! Our food has always been fresh. Service is unmatched and one of the owners recognized me and my husband since our very first visit offering us free chutney to take home, and he has recognized us ever since! Tandoor Char House should be the prototype for service, freshness, and a perfect blend of intricacy of flavor and simplicity of ingredient. We love it here, we being every friend who visits us, and we hope for their continued success and longevity. Coming here feels like a dream each time.",

It's a small, almost family style setting, but it's not cramped or stuffy. The owners and founders run around and help take tables and talk about the food, of which they are very passionate, and with good reason. Each item we tried was as tasty as the next, and the the fact they are BYOB adds a bit to the appeal: you can pick up a $15 bottle of wine and enjoy a meal you'd be proud to show any \"out-of-towner.\" HIGHLY recommended, and definitely come with an appetite, or a plan to take a to go box.",

Making a reservation through OpenTable - a dreadful service - did not work. I just went there.  Papadums were good. Accompanying chutney was interesting but not really a chutney. Salad so-so. Paratha not bad but not very crispy (instead, bit soggy). Rice OK. Fish tikka masala nice, spicy, bit too wet.  All in all a nice dinner which resembled Indian food in a way one would not often find in the US. Reasonably priced.",
