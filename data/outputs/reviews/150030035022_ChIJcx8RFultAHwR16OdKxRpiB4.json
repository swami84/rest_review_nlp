Do not over cook your meat, if you aren't sure, don't be afraid to ask the best way to cook it, their servers are so nice and will gladly give you tips on the best way to cook the meat to perfection. Some say they're small portions, but it's perfect for us. Parking is out front with about 10-12 stalls.

Being that I just came back from Japan, my review may not be doing justice, however compared to LA places of similar caliber, I will have to say meat quality falls short.  Particularly the prime kalbi.  While raw, it looked nice and marbely and good, however after it's been cooked on the grill even at medium rare, the meat texture was kinda leathery and dry.  The thick cut tongue was good, but at $36 for 9 pieces, it better.  Oh and rice was $4 a bowl....a bit overpriced for rice.  I'm kinda glad I didn't order the A5 Wagyu like a lot of the Yelp reviews suggested as I think I would likely be disappointed since I already had various cuts of A5 while I was in Japan recently.  Overall, if you're in the mood for yakiniku, I'd suggest coming here for their happy hour deals as it's a descent deal.",
