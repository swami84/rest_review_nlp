I didn't even need that geo-bio pre-qualifier- Mojito sucks. ( Please note, actual mojitos are several kinds of delicious)  Ordered a close approximation of pollo guisado and the steak which we asked to be cooked med rare. The pollo guisado tasted like canned tomato pur\u00e9e mixed with olives and the whitest chicken I have ever seen in a coloured stew. I had to try 'browning' the chicken back home in my broiler. This did zero for the already absent flavour. The beans did not taste any different from DelMonte or canned Goya. Geez. I could have browned some onions and added thyme sprigs and made canned peas taste better. Maybe the steak was not good enough quality to be served at the temp we requested, but medium rare is not fully cooked in Cuban or any language. (I know that Cuban is a nationality not a language- stay on topic) We also ordered a side of sweet plantain which is very difficult to get wrong and they didn't --except that it was 5$ which over at Cafe Habana would not make me blanche, but all told without tip Mojito asked me for 40$ of my dollars for absolute shytte (not a typo)  food.  If this crap was cheap I would have been disgusted and carried on with life. I am determined today, to spend quality time blasting this restaurant for their audacity in selling this crap and calling it 'Cuban'. Disgrace. And that watered down green mayonnaise they call chimichurri? Obvious cost-cutter at the expense of valuable taste. I am angry because I wasted my unemployment money treating myself and!! it was so bad I threw out the strange white excuse for chicken, the tomato situation, the beans, my portion of the plantains and I am still hungry and I HATE THROWING OUT FOOD. Signed, disgruntled, still hungry, fortgreener.",
