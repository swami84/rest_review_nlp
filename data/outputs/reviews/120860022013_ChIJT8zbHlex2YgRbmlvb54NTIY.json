I wish I knew everyone\u2019s names but Amy and Mia were just so friendly and educated us on what we ate. The bartenders were so friendly.

We also had the oysters with uni and caviar which were delicious. Our waiter, Stefan took such great care of us. He was very attentive, walked us through the menu and have excellent recommendations. The service in this restaurant is unbeatable from the time you are greeted by the host, to the bartenders, to the managers who come around and check to see how your food is cooking on the grill. Daniel also took good care of us and you can tell that they take service very seriously. Coming back next weekend!",
