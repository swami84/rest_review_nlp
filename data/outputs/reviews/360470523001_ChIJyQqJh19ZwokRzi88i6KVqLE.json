The coconut based yogurt was light, the granola tasted homemade, and the banana was the perfect ripeness. We requested for the caramel on the side and it wasn't overly sweet. It tasted unique in a good way. I requested to have the unused portion to take home because it was just so good. Exceptional dessert that tasted super fresh and healthy.  I ordered the Burrito crepe and my SO ordered Jacked up. They're both savory crepes but very different flavors.  The burrito had a hint of spiciness and the cashew cheese flavor really stood out. The coconut bacon added a nice crunch. I'm amazed it's vegan. I can believe it if someone had told me it's vegetarian, but it's mind blowing that it's vegan.  I had a few bites of the Jacked up and it's delicious. If you prefer more of a BBQ flavor, it might be more up you alley. I prefer a creamier and denser food so the burrito outshines the jacked up for me.  For our drinks we ordered a pot of unlimited Headache Be Gone tea. They use actual tea leaves, flowers, herbs, and plants. I was brought up drinking tea (not the store bought teabags kind) and I wasn't expecting such good tea. There's even a cute hourglass that indicates 1, 3, and 5 minutes. I recommend letting it soak for at least 5 minutes to bring out the flavor if you prefer a strong flavor.  Will be back. I hope they are able to stay open because it's a great cute delicious vegan spot.",

She was not expecting to like anything vegan whatsoever but she loved it and would go back (and she is absolutely not vegan). I ordered food to pick up. My only reasons/criticisms for taking off 1 star are: 1. The prices on the google maps menu are different than what their actual prices are right now. The items are about $4 more than listed on google maps. My total was way more than I expected. Still ok, but I\u2019d recommend updating the app so customers have the right expectation to what they will pay when they arrive/pickup. 2. Some items in my pickup order were incorrect. For example, one crepe I ordered strawberry jam and got fresh strawberries instead; I ordered coconut bacon on one and got coconut flakes instead. Regardless, they were still delicious. 3. It took about 45min to cook. I was quoted 30, kind of long either way but worth the wait. Again, the food was delicious and I would go back whether I end up sticking with veganism or not.",

There were at least five people \"working\" at the main counter. I tried look at the menu board but was shooed upstairs and told someone would be with me. And then I waited. And waited. And waited. At this point I just felt awkward and embarrassed because I was by myself, the only Black customer and so obviously being ignored.  The restaurant was hardly full and I didn't know if the staff was just bad or if I was being ignored because I was Black. Either way, it was mortifying. After about twenty minutes I went back downstairs and saw all of them just chatting and laughing, doing absolutely nothing. I asked them how long they were going to make me wait and they finally stopped talking but I just left at that point.  What a ridiculous restaurant.",

There just weren't any check ups at the table and it was near impossible to politely catch someone's eye to ask for something -- I ended up needing to go downstairs to where employees were stationary because they were cooking. The atmosphere is really pleasant both upstairs and downstairs, and the food is consistent. There was something overwhelmingly bitter in my mushroom crepe that I couldn't identify, but it was also in the pizza crepe I had last time I was here, and it was really off-putting both times. The place has redeeming qualities though, esp being vegan, and I can see myself going back for dessert crepes (this was really nice last time, didn't have one this time) and trying another savory one.",

It's an art to cook and bake vegan and gluten-free food that tastes even better than non-vegan food. I had a very delicious crepe with mushrooms, spinach and walnuts and cashew-based cheese (so tasty) at the side. It was so good, if I wouldn't have been full after one I would have loved to try all the other savory crepes too. I also had a crunchy-soft scone with coconutmilk-based clotted cream and homemade raspberry jam. Really, this vegan restaurant (for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner) is a must-visit for people who appreciate very tasty, qualitative animal-free and gluten-free food!",

They really need to get with the program and provide Oat milk, the creamers they provide for the coffee all separate and leave the coffee with a weird texture. My friend and I split 2 crepes.  One sweet with nutella, bananas, and almonds, it was amazing! The other crepe was a savory one called \u201cthe burrito\u201d or something like that. I highly recommend splitting a savory and sweet with a friend. Just getting one whole sweet one might be too much sweetness in one sitting.
