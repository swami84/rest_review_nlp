        "caption": "So first of all I would like to start out on how bad the service is. My family and I walked in and thought we would immediately be seated because the server was just standing there. It took about 2 minutes for us to be actually checked in. And even after that I thought that we would be seated immediately, but no. We had to wait 20 minutes for the table to be CLEARED. Just cleared. The restaurant itself is fairly small so I would say that that is WAY too long for us to be seated. Another thing I would like to complain about is about the restaurants menu quality. The papers themselves kept falling out of the binder and the thing that irked me the most was the amount of menus they gave us which was 3 when we had 7 people with us. I could understand if they had given us 6 menus because we had a child with us but no. They gave us three. You could even see more menus in plain sight that weren\u2019t  being used. The food is actually pretty good, but the way it was served is awful. One of the orders that were served to us was served in a bowl that looked pretty nice but was in such bad quality. Other times the food that was supposed to be hot were cold and which is a sign of frozen food. When we ordered some rice, they gave us half of the bowl. Not 70 percent or 60 percent. Half. Which in my eyes is pretty disappointing. They don\u2019t even give us napkins we had to ask for them. At this point this restaurant doesn\u2019t even deserve more than 0 stars. I\u2019d stop ranting but this place really needs to change. The bathroom was in terrible quality as well as a terrible location. I\u2019ll start with the bathroom location. You\u2019d have to walk through the kitchen and at that point you\u2019d already be disappointed, but it gets worse. The bathroom door is open which is pretty disgusting. You walk in and the urinal is very unsanitary. Maybe to the point where it\u2019s not safe to use. Then I go onto the sink. The knobs don\u2019t even work and when it does the water is super cold. You can\u2019t even get warm water. This is my final point on why you shouldn\u2019t come here but there are many more flaws that aren\u2019t fixed. The employees seem to be very careless at their job. They don\u2019t give us napkins, enough menus, and to top it all off they watch us as we eat. I\u2019m not talking about a quick glance to see if we need water or more rice. I\u2019m talking about WATCHING. Which is a good enough reason to not come here, even without the other things. Anyways there are many other things, but in conclusion, this place treats you badly, violates your health and safety, and to top it all off is just a lazy place. IM WARNING YOU.",

The dan dan noodles was a perfect spice level for the whole party. It's the numbing spice but it still retained a lot of flavor. I was glad that the server let me take the shot before she mixed it up. We had the mapo tofu with ground pork next. One friend had to tap out since it was significantly spicy. I loved it. I just wish it would have came with some rice. Luckily, we also ordered the traditional yang zhou fried rice. It didn't have a lot of salt or overpowering flavor so it actually paired well with the mapo tofu. The orange Fanta bottle was one with cane sugar so my friend enjoyed that. I would come back here again to try some different things.",

I tried the pork belly which was crispy and mixed with different vegetables. The dish had a real good kick of spice. The lady tried short ribs which was just as good with a rich flavor. Sweet and sour soup was interesting. I get lots of sweet and sour soups in the suburbs but that taste much different. The soup had a real sour punch to it which I have never tasted before. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing, kind of indifferent and still deciding. Crab rangoon had a real nice consistency inside. Dishes came with a bowl of sticky white rice. Also they let you write on the walls with markers, pretty cool.  Try the pork belly and you wont regret it.  CHEERS !!!",

Compared to other places in the plaza, this is definitely much cleaner, service is pretty good, and there's even a 2nd level where they host larger parties / groups. I absolutely love their noodles here. Can't go wrong whether it's a traditional beef chow mein or some dan dan noodles, you won't be disappointed. The boiled fish is also pretty good, and I can appreciate it's mellowed out a bit so you don't have to worry about your face melting off. Be sure to hold onto your receipt as they do offer coupons to Bingo Tea a few doors down in case you're craving some boba after a meal from here.  'Til next time!",

The staff is fantastic and take great care of their customers. You will never be without a filled drink.  I highly recommend the Egg Drop Soup, Egg Rolls and Spicy Garlic Chicken! Portions are huge, so come hungry and consider picking a couple things to share. Run out of rice? Just ask for more, they\u2019ll be happy to accommodate!  Definitely check this place out when visiting Chicago! Prices are fantastic for being in the Chicago area!",

The feel of the place is easy, light and manageable though there are a lot of people coming in and out all the time. The food measures up to everything I have heard and read about this place.

The Cheng Du dumplings were terrific -- great flavor and not overpowering spice for those that want a little chili taste but not a running nose. The honey pepper steak was delightful as well as the dry chili chicken. Everything was perfect! Our favorite part was the service. Kevin, our server, was beyond helpful and friendly!! Thanks so much MCCB!",

We were extremely happy to finally try this location on our tour of Chinatown restaurants. We started with the Dry Chili Calamari, Crab Rangoon & Sweet and Spicy Beef Shumai. Followed by the Crisy Mango Shrimp (which were great), Jumbo Shrimp Chow Mein, Fresh Garlic Tong Choi (Delicious), Dry Chili Flank Steak , Clams with Black Bean Sauce (Demolished in Minutes) & Salt And Pepper Short Ribs (My Fav). Our sever was very engaged in our dining experience making sure we had everything we needed and wanted. Only thing I can say more is I want to go back.",

First off, they probably have the best service in Chinatown! The waiters are very attentive and thoughtful.Our absolute favorite dish is the dan dan pork fried rice! It's not labeled as a spicy dish, but c'mon now, you're at a Sichuan restaurant, how can it not be spicy?! The portion is humongous. The sauce is fragrant and savory! They also use fermented soybeans, which adds a nice flavor. I recently tried the boiled flank steak and the Chengdu spicy dumplings. YESSS to both! The boiled flank steak is pretty much spicy braised beef. The sauce is numbingly spicy but so delicious!! The portion is quite generous. The chengdu dumplings are not as spicy as I had expected. It's more of a sweet chili taste. You seriously cannot go wrong with anything here!",

We also tried the steamed dumpling and it was pretty okay, I would prefer the fried one. Lastly, we tried their braised soup and that was pretty nice to end the meal with hot soup.

Growing up, it was always our parents who made the Chinatown decisions and this restaurant was a great first \"adulthood\" decision, haha.  We ended up ordering their Chengdu Style Hot Pot where they were able to replace the meat-stock with water, but don't worry all the flavor was there! It was also a HUGE serving (pictured below). This is truly in the Sichuan spirit, so if you're looking ma-la and bold flavor -- MCCB is the place to be!  With the option of Vegetarian dishes, great flavor, friendly staff -- highly recommend! This is also a great place for meatatarians as we saw all our neighboring tables order as elaborate meaty dishes. Perhaps MCCB could be your next middle ground for both!  We will be visiting again! :)",

We also ordered the cumin lamb and Szechuan green beans. The cumin lamb had just the right balance of flavors. The Szechuan green beans has a lot of visible peppercorns, but it doesn't overtake the flavors of the dish.  Overall was very pleased with dinner and the wait staff.

The only issue is that the line is long. We come on  weekday evening and still need to wait in line for half and hour. Also, the price is about $5 per dish more expensive than other resturants in Chinatown. Overall, if the line is not too long, it worths the wait to try.",
