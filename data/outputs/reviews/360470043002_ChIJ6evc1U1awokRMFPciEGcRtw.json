Understandably, this mediocre \u201cboutique\u201d hotel wants to play up its fake Brooklyn-ness for its tourist clientele base and give off a rough and edgy vibe but this is just SO overly manufactured and uncool. More importantly it is absurdly tone deaf for these hoteliers to drop into a neighborhood with a name this flippant and offensive. Our justice system is flawed and so are the people with poor judgement who named this severely lame restaurant. Unless a significant portion of profits are donated to legal services or social justice organizations I really hope people stop patronizing this place. I urge visitors to this hotel to go to any of the incredible restaurants and bars (with GENUINE local character) just down Smith street. Also, if the hotel is looking for alternate names, I can already think of several wittier legal terms and references in Latin to rebrand with.",
