I highly reccomend it if your in to thai food. The flavor will knock your socks off.

        "caption": "Located in the same space previously occupied by Pok Pok, Krok is a worthy if not a better replacement. It focuses on Northeastern Thai food just like Uncle Boons. But unlike its Spring Street competitor which has sadly become an overpriced tourist trap, Krok offers all of the flavors and skill without sky high prices. My girlfriend and I were there for a celebratory Monday lunch. We went with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, fish sauce wings, spring rolls and a couple of curries. Everything was delicious with the only complaint being the spring rolls. They were on the smaller side and unlike everything else that we ordered, which was full of flavor, the rolls didn't taste much like anything. But, in retrospect this is partly our fault for ordering spring rolls from a menu that features many much more exciting options. Be prepared to pay with cash for a 10% discount and if you forget there is an ATM inside with a $2 withdrawal fee. Overall this is a solid if not great Thai restaurant that deserves to stand on its own. We will be back.",

Additional benefit is that if you pay in cash, you get 10% of your bill. It is also close to the water that you can walk off those calories. I will be going back!",
