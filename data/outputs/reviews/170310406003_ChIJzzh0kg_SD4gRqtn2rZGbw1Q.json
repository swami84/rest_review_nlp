Officially titled Baker Miller Bakery & Dinette, a combination caf\u00e9 and mill house from former Bang Bang Pie employees that debuted in 2014, much of the Miller\u2019s early praise came from house-ground Grains, hand-milled Flour and Chicago\u2019s first \u201cToast Bar,\u201d while critiques of both price and inconsistency have also been commonplace.  Using online or walk-up ordering during COVID-19, staff appropriately donning PPE but inattentive-bordering-on-rude while waiting for two slices of Bread to be toasted, it was on a nearby bench that the Miller\u2019s goods were eaten, buttered naturally-leavened Sourdough an immediate highlight thanks to both tanginess and crumb while a $3.75 Biscuit was arguably underbaked at the bottom but nonetheless enjoyable.  Trying hard not to focus on prices, David and Megan\u2019s commitment to their craft most certainly commendable, it is hard not to raise an eyebrow at $3.50 for a two-bite Sandwich Cookie that tastes mostly like Sugar, a quarter more for double the amount of Chocolate Chips and perfectly baked Dough faring far better in terms of taste as well as value.  Also performing well with a toothsome Thumbprint Cookie, Strawberry Jam providing just enough sweetness to a blend of Nuts and Oats, those seeking a \u201csignature\u201d item will find it in Baker Miller\u2019s \u201cDoughboy,\u201d the baked round far lighter than a Doughnut and currently dressed like Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal clocking in at $4.50 after tax \u2013 far better than the more expensive Blueberry Oat Muffin which finds Fruit in a clump at the center of an otherwise flavorless matrix.",

It's also always a treat to pop in on my way to work to fill my travel coffee mug (without a doubt one of my favorite cups of coffee in the city) and grab a hand pie (yum, yum, yummmm). They should get a sixth star for making their own graham crackers for their pie crust (try the key lime, STAT) and a seventh for all of the work they do to lift up others in our neighborhood and beyond (from sharing smiles with customers to donating to worthy causes to promoting other local businesses to being a beacon of light during the pandemic).

Yesterday we picked up breakfast sandwiches and the lox plate. Each plate and sandwich comes with a fresh green salad.

The pie was great, cinnamon rolls were fantastic and HOLY COW the biscuits are delicious! Staff have always been very pleasant and helpful. My only issue so far was that the cinnamon rolls were take and bake and didn't have reheating directions, but it was easy enough to figure out. Will definitely be ordering from them again, especially after seeing how they have treated their staff throughout the stay at home order - it seems like they actually care a lot about their employees and their health and it's great to see!",

Did you know they MAKE their own graham crackers for their graham cracker crust pies?!? They are constantly trying new things and growing and improving as a business. They run weekend specials, sometimes have unique dining opportunities that are sometimes a limited run or new experiments (burgers that were heavenly and the buffalo grits!!). But above all they are really paying attention to science and safety when making policies for how they conduct business during this pandemic. Curb side pick up and limited range delivery only.

The menu says this comes with a \"soft egg\" but I asked the nice man at the counter if they could give me an over easy egg instead as I'm totally opposed to runny egg whites. He said it was cool and had the cook (owner?) come over and show him how to adjust my egg preference on the tablet. When the dish came, that egg yolk was hard. Like chalky hard. He fried that thing all the way through.  My boyfriend ordered the Egg & Bacon biscuit with a side of potatoes.  The potatoes on both of our dishes were definitely under cooked. Despite those things, we enjoyed our food. The pastries looked delicious and they have horchata pie! I mean, c'mon now. We'll definitely be back for it.  Gotta say though - you guys need to clean your bathrooms up a bit. There were some gross looking questionable spots in there.",

We placed our order in front, the GF order the Elote Hash with an egg over medium instead of the soft egg that originally comes with it. I order the Egg and Bacon biscuit sandwich with potatoes. A1 for presentation, the Hash especially. Both our dishes had potatoes and some I mean just some 1/10th of the potatoes were undercooked. The GF egg came over hard unfortunately but it happens quite often when we order in other restaurants. Outside of that the food was great we enjoyed everything. Flavors were there and we would definitely come again. We might just come back later today to have some PIE!!!! The staff were friendly and nice. We would definitely recommend to our friends and family!!",

When I asked the person at the counter if that\u2019s how it usually comes she just said yes. Hollandaise sauce is on the bottom not on the top and the salad is right on the same plate which means the salad dressing is also Holindaise, this should be revisited by the management. The premade coffee in vacuum Pump style giant thermoses was lukewarm at best and an tasty at worst. They did have oat milk that was niceButter and jam bar still looked messy for the prices they charge there is no value here I won\u2019t be coming back",

What I found was a pretty decent but unremarkable eating experience surrounded by lots of eclectic cafe flair reminiscent of a pop up, Instagram bar.  I had a cappuccino with zero artistry and my friend had a tasty kombucha that came in a bottle that you can pour into a mason jar. For my breakfast I had the sausage maple cheddar biscuit. I underestimated the biscuit portion which was easily my least favorite part, but I just don\u2019t like biscuits. My friend enjoyed it. The eggs and cheddar were tasty though the egg was a custard which meant scrambled and then fried - I would have preferred a nice, greasy fried egg. The maple was a great touch.  My friend had the Shakshouka Heirloom Oat Bowl. I was instantly jealous. The oat/grain base was hearty and flavorful, topped with all sorts of goodies like avocado, a hard boiled egg and the shakshouka which I believe was the spicy red salsa like substance that soon dominated the whole mix. I had potatoes on the side of my biscuit sandwich instead of salad and dipped it in the mix, and it was amazing.  The whole meal cost over $40 before tip which was a bit of a shock. This is not a place to go for a quick bite. It\u2019s cute, has a patio and the staff isn\u2019t rude but for my eating experience I really felt like I overspent. I don\u2019t know that I have any reason to return, it was a fun experience but I can\u2019t justify the price for what I had.  I think Baker Miller is about a 3.4, so I rounded down.",

How does a breakfast place run out of eggs 10 minutes after they open?

But, honestly, I always enjoyed the time it took. The portions appeared to be smaller, and they had changed sliced fresh avocado to a scoop of sort of brownish guacamole. Also, I know they're pressed for space, but storing baked goods right next to the restroom was just sort of off-putting. I'll give them another shot next month.",

Really good coffee and the food is all very good as well, though somehow each time I go I seem to spend around $10 or more.  One baked good and a coffee will be closer to $10 than I'm fully comfortable with, but its all delicious.   I would recommend their toast / topping buffet option (3 pieces of soft bread with about 10 different type of toppings to try from), their vegan chocolate cake (so moist and dense!), and their version of eggs benedict.  Sometimes when I come here I feel like things taste a little weird (not bad), but I think its because I'm used to all the processed bread and bleached flour from stores.
