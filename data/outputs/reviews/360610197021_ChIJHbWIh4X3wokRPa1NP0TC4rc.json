Today I had time to actually walk in to place a order. When I walked in the lady was playing on her phone. I kindly waited for her to notice me. She didn\u2019t the chef in the back had to tell her to look up. I asked her for what I always ordered and she actually yelled at me saying \u201cwe don\u2019t make that where is that on the menu?\u201d I kindly told her I ordered that all of the time. She doubled the price. (I honestly didn\u2019t say anything because I was tired) when my order was ready her nose was running and she was trying to hold the snot with her forearm for a while before getting tissue. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fwhen I got home, I realized that not only was she rude, and sloppy  but actually got my order wrong. Never ever ever again will I be going here. This is the first time I ever had issues here btw. Front desk cashier should be fired.",

I I like their noodles and fried dishes too. I really like their delivery speed and the fact that they don\u2019t send you to a website to make an order for delivery  The bad: The big drawback for me is that their Chicken and broccoli  is swimming in chunky brown sauce and the chicken itself is a little too chewy.",
