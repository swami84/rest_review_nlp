But if you are looking for a traditional steakhouse or Italian restaurant (like we thought we were getting) you will be thoroughly disappointed with the food....  The menu seems very haphazard with no direction whatsoever. The short rib dish was totally underserved in the rib department (2.5\u201d of \u201crib\u201d on a large piece of cornbread served on a bowl of corn). All three short rib dishes in our party were left totally unfinished and were sent back to the kitchen. The amount short rib was very meager, our family members felt the portions were unfair for a $40 menu item.  The gnocchi was absolutely awful... I come from an Italian family I cannot believe such a simple Italian favourite was messed up so badly. The dish seemed to be more like triangular shaped tofu than an Italian gnocchi. The sauce and liquid it was served with was inedible...  Anyways, this seems like a pretty harsh review and I guess it is. This was just a dinner meeting amongst a group of friends all from far distances that happens only once a year for our group, so it was pretty unfortunate.  To be fair the manager took all of the items off the bill and offered us alternatives which we refused (our problem, I know). We were also given free coffees as a thank you.  The reason why I wrote this is because us I want other perspective patrons to know this is more of a vegan/granola/health food style restaurant and not an Italian restaurant or steakhouse at all (which is what we thought we were getting).  The reviews looked great but I knew something was off as the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night at 7PM when we arrived.  Maybe it was an off night...",

Perfectly crisp on the outside, soft inside, dusted with a light coating and finished with flaky salt. We both ordered the lunch combos, mine was the pulled chicken sandwich with a white bean and tomato soup. They sent the soup out separately so they included an heirloom tomato salad that was really good! The soup was a little greasy for my taste which I didn\u2019t expect. I pictured something creamy, but this was almost like a chili. The sandwich was also a surprisingly dry. I pictured a simmered meat in sauce but it was like regular seasoned chicken pieces. The Cuban sandwich was sort of whimpy without much pork. So... there\u2019s room for improvement, but the staff and ambiance were warm and inviting. Hopefully the food catches up!",

However, despite the delay in responses, everything was figured out in time for the dinner and everything was executed exactly as we planned! The food was delicious! Several of our guests have mentioned this to me several times since the dinner. And the venue was beautiful! We rented the back patio area under the pavilion. I was a little nervous having a dinner outside in June, but it turned out to be wonderful! They were very accommodating and helpful the day of! I would definitely recommend the Marketplace for an event!",

With all the construction there was a parking advisory but since we had a 5:30 dinner reservation we were able to park very close and since the restaurant is mere steps from the Palace we opted for dessert and coffee following our meal which had us at the theater in plenty of time for the 8:00 performance. When I made the reservation I stated that one of the party was vegetarian and our menu selections reflected that request. The vegetarian had a starter of roasted vegetables and a gnocchi main dish which were excellent! The meat lover of the party enjoyed the poached egg salad on smoked salmon starter followed by lamb shank main course. We shared a pear cobbler with coffee. Everything was exceptional, even the coffee. Our server was attentive and the level of conversation was very comfortable. We are already planning our next visit.",

My fianc\u00e9 had a delicious juicy perfectly cooked steak with smashed fingerling potatoes that were perfectly seasoned. I had the lobster tacos, they were awesome too! Strange to say that the most well cooked lobster I've ever eaten came in 10 dollar taco meal! But it's true. These people know what they are doing in the kitchen! For dessert we had a chocolate orange cake with vanilla bean Gelato and candied orange peel garnish. One of the best desserts we have ever eaten. The candied orange peel was such an unexpected treat! Our server was super attentive and treated us like million dollar tipper even though we had lunch specials. Overall....Amazing!!! Thank you Marketplace!",

The entree was the fried chicken breast. It was thin and mostly breading which made it hard and crunchy. The pork chop was good but not good enough for $26.00. The server was nice and did not charge us for the chicken but with so many amazing restaurants in louisville they need to step it up fast! Food and cocktails were not up to par for the prices.",

I can definitely see myself enjoying Bourbon,  an appetizer, and a live jazz act. The food itself was good,  the menu isn't huge which I prefer... And the price ranges for 16-37 for most entr\u00e9es.  Had a Chilean sea bass in a honey Chipotle that was pure perfection! (this was the special that evening) My girlfriend had a filet Mignon that, while not mind blowing... Mmm sea bass, was still delicious and prepared as she requested. Service was friendly and relatively fast for a Friday evening. Would highly recommend...conveniently located just beyond Fourth St live,  the Palace, and near the historic Brown hotel.",

Delightful atmosphere, good food, knowledgeable wait staff, live jazz - seriously, you can't ask for more. If this was located in DC or Chicago, it would be packed, even on a rainy Wednesday evening.",

While The BBQ pulled pork risotto fritter appetizer had excellent taste, the NY strip steak was full of fat and gristle. ISteaks at Outback are better quality. The purple potato pur\u00e9e and greens underneath the steak were bland. I was so disappointed I skipped dessert. Maybe it was just a bad night, but I would advise ordering a steak here. There are a lot of good restaurants in town, I doubt I will come back.",

The place is very attractive inside--not something you'd expect in Louisville.  I think they've changed up the menu recently since it was different than the last time I was there.  Lunch has a variety of salads, sandwiches, and a few entrees, presented in an appealing way.  Details like thick cut bacon and homemade thick chips.  The drinks have fun details like sprigs of rosemary.  Sometimes there's live music, such as a piano player.  The only downside is that it's never crowded, so there isn't a vibrant scene there.  (Yet...)  I hope Louisville catches on.",
