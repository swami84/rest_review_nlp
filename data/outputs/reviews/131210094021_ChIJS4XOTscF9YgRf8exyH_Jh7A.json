Upon arriving, the wait staff did not greet us in a friendly manner or acknowledge us any way.  Finally we approached lady behind the register when we were ready to order and she was less then friendly. Almost as if they were upset that we were there. After placing our order they did not offer us any where to sit, so we just stood there  and of the workers proceeded to mopping the floors. I work in the service industry and to say I was disappointed by the attitude of the staff is an understatement. I could understand if we came 5 minutes before closing but that wasn\u2019t the case so we just ate in the car. I would give one star but I\u2019m giving 2 because I liked the a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls",

I had a fine experience the first time with their juices. The second time, I decided to try some of their food. I got the southwestern wrap and loved it. The Third time I returned I got the chicken salad sandwich only because they were \"out\" of the wraps. That night I was struck with the worst FOOD POISONING you could ever imagine. So bad that I almost got my roommate to take me to the ER. I was out of work and wildly sick vomiting for three full days. I contacted them and spoke with the owner who was very kind and extremely apologetic. she made it clear that they strive to be a place to provide healthy, clean food to their customers and encouraged me to return and try something else on them. Having worked in the food and service industry for a long time, I understood and appreciated her apology, and left it at that. I didn't return for about 2 months after that because I had no desire to relive the situation that I went through the last time. Well today, I visited again because I was craving that southwest wrap, but am trying to go gluten free, so instead got the southwest salad. I was / am wildly disappointed with what I pulled out of the bag upon arriving to work to eat my Lunch. Had I seen it before leaving Veda Juice, I would have kindly refused and not paid NINE dollars +tax for this pathetic salad. Here's what it looks like. I haven't touched it and took photos immediately. The lettuce is mostly brown, the salad appears to be mixed up and looks like it has already been half eaten by someone. If I had time and didn't have to work, I would take it back immediately and demand a refund.",

The staff was very friendly, but shortly after taking two wheatgrass shots and an 8 oz. juice, I experienced a bad headache and nausea/vomitting. I read a few articles on some of the possible negative effects of wheatgrass and the most common side effect was headaches/nausea. But this is usually due to the body not being used to wheatgrass and is intolerant of it. I drink the grand slam at Arden's Garden (which includes a shot of wheatgrass) at least 3x a month and never experience these side effects. I've even taken a double grand slam which includes 2 shots of wheatgrass. I continued to read into this and found that another reason I could've expereienced these side effects is if the wheatgrass wasn't cleaned properly and contained a naturally occurring mold that is usually eliminated with proper storage and care of wheatgrass. I'm not going to say that this is entirely the fault of Veda Juice, because it could have been a bad batch, but I vomitted everything I ate today and I normally don't have these issues with wheatgrass from Arden's Garden. $10 gone straight down the toilet and a day's work lost because I had to go home and rest. The employee who made the shots was also not that knowledgeable on how to even make these shots, so it leads me to believe that it probably was a contaminated batch. Other than that, the store was clean. They even have a rewards program and the juices taste pretty good. They would have 5 stars if it weren't for the food poisoning.",

No spreads offered.   when I went to eat it the cheese and chicken fell out because the bread wasn\u2019t sliced correctly. 5-  I took one bite and tossed it out because it was not even close to being healthy.  6- All together with chips and juice $20  I do not recommend this service, location or food to anyone.",
