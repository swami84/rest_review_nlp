While we miss our happy hours at the bar watching Seki-san work his magic, the stepped-out-of-DC-and-into-Tokyo feel is still there. Plus I could eat their kalbi and potato salad for every meal. Can also confirm that their takeout holds up, and is very carefully (beautifully even?) packaged to go.",

I'd been dying to check out this Izakaya because I love Japanese bars and having studied Japanese most of my life and lived in the country, I just love Izakayas. I take a date there. We wait to sit and our waiter takes our app and drink order, tries to take our drink menu after we say we'll hold on to it. He was like \"I can bring it back!\" If they had very few menus, he could have said \"this is our only drink menu\" or something other than arguing w me when I didn't know anything was wrong.  That was the least of it. He came back to the table only a few times. Once  to notify me that there was an English side of the menu. I was looking at the Japanese side reading it, and maybe he thought I was dumb and couldn't turn a menu over. Like Maybe he thought I was about to complain about foreign words, but I hadn't, I didn't, I wouldn't. He really did tell me at least three times I didn't have to read the Japanese side. Then he swung by again to correct my Japanese.(this guy is not Japanese himself no matter his language proficiency. So we're both non-Japanese.) He did it again a second later when he finally asked us if wanted anything and proceeded to judge all the questions I was asking. And out right refused to order  something I didn't even order yet.  The food we did order was great. They menu was limited, sake selection is good...but who wants to eat any food while being gaslight by an angry waiter? I guess he made enough money that night or he hates women. I won't go back.",

I realized we left the credit card on the dining table,  We called millions times and no one reply. My wife google it and told me the restaurant doesn\u2019t have a cell phone, they can only be contacted by email. She emailed them, never reply.  Fine!!! I don\u2019t know if the owner gonna check this message, but could you give me an idea about the extra tips? The food is $111.65 ( we don\u2019t order any alcohol at all) , I pay $130 which more than 15% tips. I am working on get my new credit card from the bank, so I check the transaction record. Why do you charge $131.65? I don\u2019t mind $1.65 , but you can\u2019t charge whatever you want to, right? I\u2019m back to NY and What should I do now? Call you? Oh you don\u2019t have phone in 21th century. Well done, Seki!",

I asked what the happy hour menu was and she said oh, you know the drinks and the poke dish with no price. I\u2019m just so annoyed by her and one of the other server\u2019s (who i think is an owner) poor service. Another time I came by and they insisted there were no seats for happy hour when there were seats available. She had to put me on a list, even though there were no customers using the seats. The whole thing is so un-japanese and unwelcoming. They act like it is a chore to allow someone to eat in the restaurant. Very hipster and too cool for you. If you are going to try the restaurant, don\u2019t do it during happy hour. They haven\u2019t seem to get how that works...",

I don't know why it took us so long, but the boy and I have been wanting to try Izakaya Seki for the longest time and we finally got around to it this past week.  Since we came just under a hour before they were closing, there were plenty of seats. We chose to sit at the bar, since we like to watch the chefs cook.  We ordered: + Chutoro ($26) + Agedashi tofu ($7.50) + Mushrooms with butter and garlic ($12.50) + Ojiya soba ($10) + Inaniwa udon ($10) + Two rice balls (ume and konbu) at $3.50 each + Tsukune ($8)  What's great about Izakaya Seki is how the customer makes the experience unique - you can come here after work to grab a couple of dishes and some sake to unwind or you can impress a date with a variety of exotic and interesting plates. I enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered, although I was mildly disappointed by the udon. The broth was a little bit too salty, quite a shame because the dashi they make is very good. Noodles were very nice too. Inaniwa udon is hand-stretched, hand-kneaded, and slightly thinner than typical udon.  Great little spot for those craving authentic Japanese cuisine. Owner of Sushi Taro even comes here. It's a casual izakaya restaurant, so the atmosphere feels relaxed. Our service was fantastic, and we even got to chat with Cizuka Seki, who was behind the counter making everyone's food and is one half of the daughter-father team behind Izakaya Seki.",

I'm from out of state so the price seems very steep comparing to a few different factors Location: any place around is very hard to find parking, the restaurant itself is very casual but with a fancy restaurant price.  As I was very unhappy what made matters worse was.. The waiter could see I was not happy and never ever asked if everything was okay or if we liked the food.. I think this made mg experience here even worse.  Food: is alright.. You might not get full with a plate or two and each one is over $17 for most.. I didn't get quite full with a single tab of 35 dollars for two small plates. Total for two hungry people can go for around $95 for 5 small plates as recommendedby server.  Service: attentive, was alright but the place is so hard to get around with a very limited space.  Price: $$$  Something i really didn't like ( I was not explained) was that when you order.. Its not a main entre but separate dish so you and your partner might not eat at the same time as I finished my meal way before his arrived. ( again I was not awared not explained)  * plate sharing * not entre etc kind of place  Came for the squid which was $17 by itself ( no dishes included)  Overall food ratio to price ratio to location ratio is a 3 at most.",

Super tiny restaurant, so get there early or wait, and you won't be disappointed. US Japanese cuisine is so riddled with \"Steak Houses\" and \"Sushi Bars\" but most people don't know that it's more than raw fish and Hibachi. This restaurant brought back memories of my trauma as a young kid with rice balls and cold noodle packed lunches in the best of ways. When you're young you think PB&Js are cool, but homestyle Japanese cuisine is where it's at when you're an adult, and I haven't found a place that does it better.",

Very good selection of Sake but this is not the main reason to come to any restaurant. Overpriced for an izakaya, which traditionally is a bar that serves a bit of food. You could leave with your wallet empty and still hungry. I would recommend they reduce the menue to 10 items or less and focus more on the sake or restructure the menu around the sake as a pairing.",

        "caption": "Horrible, horrible, horrible.  You\u2019ve been warned:  I\u2019ve got an axe to grind here.  I ate here a few years ago and I'm still incredibly bitter about the travesty of a \"dining experience\" to which my friend and I were so tepidly treated.  I happened to be in DC and was eager to spend more than usual for a special meal for my friend and I at an authentic Japanese restaurant.  I was expecting izakaya dishes served with the precision and care of kaiseki in a refined, cordial, polite, warm, and inviting atmosphere, and what we got was just the opposite.  A self-absorbed art school dropout with a nasty superiority complex, animated by an unmistakable malice (and no doubt self-loathing), shot us cold daggers across the restaurant before frigidly intercepting us as we waited patiently at the threshold of this little slice of hell.  She told us to sit right where we were standing, at the far end of the wrap-around bar.  She then proceeded to reluctantly hand us our menus, as if in disbelief and ripe with indignation that she had to serve \u201cour kind.\u201c  The judgement in the air was palpable, and as it became ever-so clear, so was the pretension.  This place served dishes so refined, so elevated aesthetically and culinarily, that it seemed as though it must only, with profound regret, open its doors to the uncultured public at all.  As our lovely waitress left to fetch our water bowls (after all, we were essentially mangy mutts in her all-knowing eyes), we glanced over the scant and steeply priced izakaya-style menu of small dishes.  Quite a few things sounded appealing, and with the price tags I assumed the food must be of very high quality.  I decided amidst my anger and humiliation at being treated like garbage to try my best to placate the waitress so that my friend and I could enjoy the food they had to offer.  That was a tremendous mistake.  The food was very hit and miss, but overall decidedly mediocre, especially given the portions and prices.  The zaru soba was particularly disappointing in texture and presentation for a restaurant with such lofty self-esteem.  It was thrown down before me, in a messy un-manicured pile on a cheap plastic tray.  Needless to say this was far from the \u201ckaiseki\u201d I was expecting.  Some portion of meat I ordered (I can\u2019t even recall what it was because my mind was overflowing with anger and disbelief) was not even edible because of the collagen was so dense\u2026 even after vigorously but discreetly chewing for at least over 60 seconds.  My friend tried the $18 dish of uni, but can\u2019t comment on the quality as it\u2019s the only time he\u2019s tried it.  Don\u2019t even get me started about the chef\u2026 he loves to give you lingering death stares.  It\u2019s not a glance to see if you\u2019re enjoying the food, but a stare to see if you\u2019re even capable of appreciating it, and moreover he wants you to know he\u2019s skeptical of your palette.  It\u2019s enough to make your heart stand still and deaden your tastebuds.  Not for the faint of heart indeed.  It\u2019s got four stars though, so somebody clearly likes this place.  And Japanese people seem to eat here, but perhaps they\u2019re given a little more respect.  Overall though, I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s the crowd who enjoys good Japanese food for it\u2019s own sake.",

Had multiple orders of the carpaccio, sashimi, short rib, tempura special, rice balls, Japanese omelet, octopus, squid, and fried shrimp... Some dishes were better than others; short ribs were disappointing as they were fatty with hardly any meat albeit flavorful.

It was just two of us, and we wanted to try everything but that seemed impossible. The sauteed shishito peppers (with crispy garlic) was amazing. It was also the best Japanese omelet I've ever had. The kara-age was great, and so was the eel and cucumber. We had a medium portion of the chef's selection of sashimi - and that was the most hit/miss dish of the evening. It was all really beautiful, and some of it was incredible and perfect, and some was not particularly enjoyable (but I think that was just a matter of personal preference). Rice balls were good too! We ended up getting sake that came in collectible glasses, so I took home two small glasses with pandas on them. We were pretty full by the end of the meal and could not entertain dessert, but next time I'd definitely try their flan and was very intrigued by both ginger and green tea ice cream (never had ginger ice cream and am pretty picky about green tea ice cream, but I'd believe theirs to be amazing).  Also I met my friend at about 6:15pm on a Wednesday after weeks of non-stop rain. He'd arrived about a half hour prior and said there was no wait. It was still pretty clear when I arrived and we were seated. It did pick up soon after.",

Try this place for sure but, I want to like this place more than I do- and that's really the bottom line.",

The monkfish liver was especially memorable. It was fresh and buttery - not frozen and chewy like many other places. We also tried the fried chicken and two different kinda of onigiri - both delicious. The service was also on point - our server came to check on us regularly to see everything is. We had an early so the place wasn't too crowded. But I heard it gets very busy and the place could get filled up quickly. This has definitely been one of my better Japanese restaurant experiences in DC. I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu.",

Everything we tried was very good.  Not really a restaurant for people who are looking for a Westernized sushi experience; half the menu is in Japanese.  Bring a sense of adventure and you'll have some of the best sashimi and nigiri DC has to offer.",
