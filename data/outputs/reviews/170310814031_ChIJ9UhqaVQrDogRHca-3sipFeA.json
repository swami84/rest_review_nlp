After checking in on Yelp, the hostess did not have an estimated time on when my party would be seated. Once seated 20 minutes after, the server took our full order and we waited a long time before even receiving our drinks (1 singular mimosa carafe and 1 latte). When our latte got to our table it was obvious it was sitting at the bar for some time; it was flat and tasted burnt.  In addition to getting 2 things wrong from our order, the crabcake benedict tasted 2 weeks old with an obvious funk to the crab.  Stick with just the online orders; they're not ready to back to regular dinning.",

However, the kitchen doesn\u2019t modify food at all and this is a trend I\u2019m noticing in breakfast restaurants that I need to die, or at least give it the rating it deserves, 3-stars. My wife wanted a Lox bagel and to sub out the cream cheese for an avocado. I totally understand the upcharge. However, they won\u2019t put it on the bagel because the kitchen doesn\u2019t do modifications. They\u2019ll charge you for the avocado and deliver it on the side. At the point you are re-building your own Lox bagel, which is actually more work than starting from scratch, what is the point of going to a restaurant where a kitchen makes your food and delivers it to you? Also, if the kitchens have discovered that this makes their food come out lighting fast with this methodology, maybe I\u2019d understand.  But no, the lead time on the food was average to probably slow, and it wasn\u2019t overly impressive in quality or presentation.  I think we\u2019ll hit the grocery store next time instead. They\u2019re lucky their staff is so stellar or they\u2019d get worse than 3 stars.",

The food quality and taste was good, but not up to the price point. The serving size was not up to the price point. Either of these on their own isn't a problem, but both at the same time is a bummer. From the hostess to our waitress, to the busser - not a single person smiled. Everyone seemed to be unhappy to be there. I ordered a benedict with veggie bacon. It was just a few strips of dry Morning Star Farms. My wife and I both ordered coffee. It was something like $3.95 for a bottomless cup of coffee. Neither of us ever got a refill or warm up. Maybe things were just off this day. It can happen. We'll try again.",

When we were seated, we noticed they were bugs hovering over our table. We asked to be seated at another table. The host, Caroline, told us we could not be seated anywhere else because the kitchen closed in 30 mins. and we have all been served drinks. Judging by her posture and tone, we didn\u2019t want to continue speaking to her so we asked to speak to the manager. She informed us that the manager will probably say the same thing that she stated, and she walked away hastefully. We were so discontented with her customer service, that we offered to pay for the drinks and leave. In brief, we did end up moving our table thanks to our waiter, Josh. He was attentive and really tried to accommodate us. However, the experience we had speaking to the host (Caroline) was distasteful. As a result of that, we will not be returning. We want to dine in places that are accommodating and that respect us. It\u2019s amazing how one bad apple can really spoil the brunch.",

At 2:30pm we had all arrived and began to order and noticed that there was nets/flies on the wall\u2014 not very noticeable but disturbing. We asked the hostess if we can move seats and she gave horrible attitude and said NO- flat out! We showed her the flies right above our head and she shrugged it off, we asked for a manager and she informed us the manager did not approve us to move because they close at 3pm. Again, we had been there since 2pm and ready to order at 2:30pm. After the hostess continue to be rude, our friend spoke with a manager who was able to RECTIFY the situation and we truly appreciate him and the waiter who was a gentleman.

I\u2019ve tried my share of Mac and cheese and this one is by far my favorite. My friend ordered the monkey bread which is essentially cinnamon, honey, caramel and walnuts. The monkey bread was amazing and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. This is def a place worth visiting. They have other locations in the city which is nice.",

Having just landed in Chicago, my partner and I were looking for a well-reviewed breakfast joint near Lakeshore, and Kanela\u2019s menu and reviews seemed promising. We were incredibly excited to enjoy some delicious French toast and waffles, but the experience started off rough when the waitress, Kristin, was standoffish about a simple question (can I get syrup, please?). We placed our order, and about 15 minutes later, the butter for our food arrived. About 20 minutes after that, our food showed up, and it was completely room temp. Additionally, the pork sausage we ordered wasn\u2019t there at all. When we pointed out that our food was cold, Kristin was again very rude, offered no apology, and just very abruptly said \u201cdo you want another?\u201d multiple times. We also asked about our sausage, after giving up on the cold food, and she said she brought our other food out while the sausage was cooking because it takes longer. Now, it\u2019s one thing to say you forgot it, but it\u2019s another to lie, because we watched our food sit there, and the sausage was the only hot item we got because it was finished about 10 minutes after the rest of our food.  Had the staff been friendly, or the food even remotely warm, this would have been a great place, and exactly what we had hoped. Unfortunately, with Kristin at the frontlines and cold food behind her, it fell extremely short.",

The hostess was kind and friendly, the waiter was always prompt, and the manager even stopped by to say hello!  I am not sure why there are other bad reviews.

The pork belly benedict was bland, chewy and hardly came with any hollandaise sauce. Tried the lemon blueberry pancakes as well and they were also very bland and only came with a tiny cup of syrup. Didn't really finish either one, which was more upsetting because they were both about $13. I did enjoy the Cinnamon Toast Brunch cocktail I must say. It was just a little too strong with the vodka for my taste, but other than that I enjoyed it. My girlfriend really loves mimosas but she was disappointed with this one.  I've worked in restaurants before so I understand how hectic it can be, so I usually give the server the benefit of the doubt if they're not having  good day for some reason, but our server didn't seem to care about providing good service.  Just a bad overall experience. Will not be returning.",

The problem became so small and forgettable because of how well they recovered. I got the potatoes, but wound up with fruit instead.... She immediately got me potatoes and didn't charge for it on my bill (with out me having to ask/remind). She didn't ask any questions, she smiled, and we both just forgot about the whole thing. Their mimosas were delicious... But I'll have to try their bloodies next time because they looked amazing! The menu is so versatile with many different healthy and comfort food options (i.e. Brussels sprouts, burgers, chicken and waffles, classic pancakes, burgers, chilaquilles, unique salads). We barely waited 10 minutes to be seated, but certainly didn't mind gazing at the awesome mid-century rustic-chic decor and witness the hustle of the open kitchen. All servers seemed happy as I witnessed many casual side bar conversations - genuinely interacting with their customers. There are dozens of choices in Chicago, but I'd come back here in heartbeat!",

The waffles had a hint of vanilla but were bland, and the chicken was so dry I had ran out of syrup just on the chicken. And when I was just about finished with my orange juice I found an orange sticker at the bottom. I notified our waitress and she said sorry and took it back and I thought she would give us another one (mind you it was four dollars a glass) but no. How hard would it be to make sure you aren't blending up orange stickers. Bottom line, the food is bland and all of it is overpriced because it's right next to navy pier.",

(there were a bunch outside empty) I guess the kitchen was backed up hence why we had to wait so long to get a table and then an additional 22 mins for our breakfast. Ordered the crab cakes Benedict, not sure it was authentic crab used and I had a mixture of raw and well done potatoes :(. But the real kicker were the biscuits and gravy with two way-undercooked sunny side up eggs ... sent them back as the eggs whites were do a jiggling dance on the dried up gravy. When they brought the eggs back, all they did was flip them over and the eggs were still raw under all that mess. So turned off at their failed attempt to remedy the dish. Sent it back and didn't order anything else. Not worth the hour wait in total ... IMO.",

I got the Pork Belly benedict, but I didn't love it, the meat was dry and wasn't as flavourful as I hoped. Hubby got the crab cake Benedict. It was really good and you can taste the crab meat. It was a top an english muffin as well, but didn't need to me.  Would recommend if you were in the area.",

I went to the Streeterville location that's close to Navy Pier but a little off the beaten path, so I would suspect it doesn't get too touristy, which is ideal for me. the atmosphere was nice. family friendly. not too hipster. the food was good. I ordered potato pancakes with a side of apple chicken sausage. the sausage was tasty and browned just right. the potato pancakes were really dense - one more so than the other - but the flavor was really good. my boyfriend had the corned beef hash, with nice big chunks of corned beef and Brussels sprouts mixed with nice chunks of potatoes. I liked it and he seemed to enjoy it - he cleaned the plate. he also said the coffee was really good. I don't drink coffee so you'll have to take his word for it.  there were plenty of menu options, including several vegetarian and vegan options. overall it was a solid restaurant. I will add it to my list of go-to spots when I'm in Chicago.",
