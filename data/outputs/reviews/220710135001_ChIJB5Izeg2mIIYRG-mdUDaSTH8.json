Giving this a 2 for their service- absolutely terrible! We had to signal every time to get our servers attention, and when she did come, she threw a lot of attitude. She couldn\u2019t even answer our questions politely and would run away before we could even get back to her and seemed super bugged every time we called her. Granted, the place was quite bustling but the attitude and complete ignorance was unnecessary. Avoid this place if you can! Or perhaps word to the management- train your staff to not be nasty towards customers and take down their orders, rather than forgetting about all of it and having to be reminded constantly!",

The receipt to the kitchen went empty and I order was missed. Our waitress Summer did an amazing job of keeping us content with drinks and checking on us frequently. Once the general manager Brian understood what happened he quickly ratified the situation and gave us our appetizer and drinks on the house. This type of customer service does not come easily to most. We will continue to support this amazing business. Honestly the food is so delicious and the drinks are on point. Things happen but the industry did an amazing job of ratifying the situation. They will forever have my business and I encourage you to give them a shot. You will not be disappointed!",

Both Brian and our lovely, waitress were attentive to our requests and frequently checked in to ensure that we were having a pleasant and safe experience. The food and mimosas were great.

I made a reservation for outdoor dining to support a local restaurant that I frequented pre-covid, and ordered take out from in the midst of quarantine.  This is my first time dining at a restaurant since the ban was lifted in phase II of the re-opening, however had talked to friends who had good experiences at other restaurants, so figured it was time.  After being seated, our waitress came to our table to take our drink order and had her mask on her chin, exposing both her nose and mouth.  I didn't say anything figuring she probably just forgot. When she came back with our drinks, she still had her mask in the same spot, so I nicely asked if she wouldn't mind covering her face to which she was not pleased with my question. The dining experience only worsened from there. She had an attitude the entire time, barely checked on us, and brought out everyone's meal but mine -- I had to flag her down and ask for it 5 minutes later.  After dining, I went inside and asked to speak to the manager. I was introduced to a man wearing a mask only covering his mouth. I explained to him the situation, and he responded by saying how they are following all safety procedures and what did I want? I informed him that I only wanted him to have his staff wear masks, and he said who isn't? Well for starters, you -- your bartender behind you and majority of your wait staff including my waitress. He was unhelpful and rude. I went back outside, asked the only waitress wearing a mask for my bill, paid, and went back inside to ask for the Manager's business card.  When I asked him for his card, he went in the back to only come out saying he didn't have one. I asked for his name and number and he asked \"why\" -- he told me I was disrupting all his patrons, and upsetting his wait staff. I never raised my voice, and the only thing I asked for was his business card.  His name is David, or that's the fake name he wrote on a piece of receipt paper.  I understand restaurants are experiencing a difficult time, hence why I am supporting them.  Never did I ask for money off my bill, I simply asked for the staff to wear a mask to keep the patron's safe.  Is that wrong? Is that too much to ask?  I hate to do this, but I would not recommend going to this restaurant in the midst of the pandemic.",

Donna and the rest of the staff were extremely polite, kind, and professional. The buffet they set up for us was beautiful and delicious. They were flexible since we weren't sure exactly how many people would attend. I would recommend The Industry for lunch, dinner, or any special occasion. The restaurant is accommodating, friendly and elegant.",

I ordered a lamb chop grill that I saw on the web and they brought me a totally different slug meat with a topping of herbs for horses. I spoke calmly with the waitress so she would take it and bring me any meat on the grill that I was going to pay for everything because it was new and I did not want to cause problems to her (I work in restaurants and I have been a DD manager), well ... What happened? He told someone, that someone calls the manager or supervisor who comes to me angry and told him that I do not want problems for the waitress. She did a good job because my order had been removed from the menu and ... Neither she nor I knew it. I ordered a NEW YORK STEAK LOIN, only salt and pepper with saut\u00e9ed vegetables ... No! Came to bring an undertaker man with a face of disgust, more ... the yerba for horses and the slug sauce next ... I ate the steak very fast. The account made $ 39.00. I left him $ 20 for the waitress (which I doubt they would give him) so they would not think I'm another of the many opportunistic clients. RETURN? NEVER!!!! And to think that I chose that place among others next door because, I recently moved into the area, it is a familiar place and it has a good score, which proved the opposite.

French fries were pretty awful- nothing different than you'd get at a random low-quality restaurant, which is not good for a $16 burger.  And, the coffee we got at the end of the meal might as well have been water.  Can't support a menu with those prices without being able to get these things right.",

I asked for it to be cooked crispy....it took 35 minutes before the pizza was delivered!!! I was told that the slow service was because I asked the pizza to be crispy!! Are you kidding me? Lastly, I ordered the Sachetti appetizer. I was told that the new Chef took it off the menu...boo,hoo!

The greeter and woman who sat us we're very nice. That's where the positives end for the Industry. The restaurant positively reeks of douchiness, it's a pretty expensive place so I had high expectations for the food. Let's see the waitress was extremely cold. The bolognese that I ordered was extremely salty and for some unknown reason the chef decided to put siracha as an accent on both of our plates. Again I had pasta bolognese and my girlfriend had the chicken parmigiana. Neither should have siracha on the plate. I like hot food but it doesn't belong. The chef came out after I mentioned it to the cold waitress. He looked like he had been on a 3 day bender, grimy looking. Apologized and walked away saying he likes it that way. I can tell you I'll never go back. It was bad from the get go.",

Met several neighbor's who stopped and chatted at our table.  Nice ambiance. Pricing higher than other neighborhood eateries, but would go again, but not every week.  Nice addition to the neighborhood.  I do miss the prices and food of the previous restaurant-. Sonny's- but I know times are changing and it is good that improvements are made to the building and area....... I would highly recommend this restaurant!",
