Our first time was before it got any Michelin stars, and each time we go, we are still astounded that this place doesn't have 3 stars. Having been to a few other 3 star, 2 star, and 1 star places, Oriole remains our favorite. The dishes have always been beautiful and incredibly creative with a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures. Service has always been perfect. They make me feel bad sometimes for getting up to use the restroom because so much has to get 're-set' because of it! Oriole was also one of the first places we've been that offered a beverage pairing (instead of just your standard wine pairing).",

This is not forty forks dining. Most anyone should be comfortable here. Sit back and expect to be delightfully challenged by some of the best food you'll find anywhere. In short... delicious,  comfortable, delightful dining that provides a unique experience without trying too hard. Masterful kitchen in search of some honing on the front of house side.

We got the non-alcoholic pairing and it was very creative and matched the different wines. I would almost be inclined to get this pairing next time as it was almost like its own set of courses.",

Received a detailed description of the many courses after the meal. There is a reason they have 3 Michelin stars...The best meal I have ever had.

While the service is definitely deserving of the two Michelin stars, the food unfortunately is not.  I informed the waitstaff twice regarding the saltiness but no adjustments were made. I'm assuming it's because many of the ingredients used were prepared beforehand.  I had high expectations but was left disappointed. At this price point (pricing is similar to many three Michelin star restaurants), there should be better control of the final product. Yes the service was wonderful but I'm there for the food. Salt can ruin an entire meal - the majority of the savory courses were oversalted.  I did notice that some of the patrons enjoyed their meals. Be warned that it may depend on which chef prepares your plates. Visit at your own risk.",

Yeah, Oriole and Chef Noah Sandoval are like that.  The entire meal was amazing, the service was wonderful, and the room was perfect.  And a few of those bites of food will remain with me for years.  Absolutely fabulous.  The 16-course tasting menu provided a well-paced evening.  The service moved along at a comfortable pace with the expert wait staff providing just the right amount of conversation and interaction to perfectly compliment the food.  This type of service, which perfectly marries the friendly and conversational with enough formality to make sure everything is perfect, was well suited to the creativity and excitement of the menu.  Rather than going down the entire menu let me provide a few highlights:  - First course of Golden Osetra Caviar with coconut dashi, lychee, and sea grape.  So many textures, so much salty sweet goodness and some unlikely but very successful marriages.  The perfect way to prepare for what is to come. - Bone Broth was so rich and amazingly layered with so many flavors that it took me by surprise.  Cinnamon, lemongrass, coriander.  I could have had a gallon - Ora King Salmon with smoked roe, spring onion, and fresh herbs was perhaps the most deftly cooked piece of fish I've ever experienced.  The outside crust was perfect and the middle barely cooked and amazingly moist and tender.  How that combination was so perfectly achieved may deserve a nobel prize if one was offered. - However the finest dish of the night, and one I will remember forever, was the Capellini with Australian winter truffle, rye berry and yeast.  A little ball of creamy al dente capellini goodness, the sauce is redolent with truffle but amazingly complex with layers and complimentary flavors.  This is to pasta with truffles what the starship Enterprise is to the space shuttle.  I absolutely loved this dish.  Of course the mignardises involved cookies and fernet - what meal is complete without fernet?  So that was awesome.  Plus we were provided excellent individual chocolate/peanut butter pies to take home (mine was delicious for breakfast).  Have I mentioned how spot on the service was?  Did I mention that the wine pairing was wonderful?  The room?  All of these things were absolutely perfect but none compared to the food.  I cannot wait to return to see what other brilliance emerges from the mind of Chef Sandoval.",

You're greeted with a unique entry and drink, both of which help set the tone for the warm/interactive evening to follow.  You feel immediately welcomed by the team of hosts/servers but also not overwhelmed.  The decor has a very cozy feel.  As quickly as you are seated, you are presented with a brief overview of what's to come but the menu remains secret as each course is only revealed as the meal progresses.  You get wonderful explanations with each course, often times by the chefs themselves which just makes the entire evening that much more endearing. We opted for the reserve wine pairing but appreciated being able to choose between that and the regular pairing as well as a la carte options.  The dishes were simply beyond compare.  To preserve the anticipation for those who haven't visited, I won't divulge what we enjoyed most but simply will state that the meal balances dishes with complex combinations you wouldn't expect with more simplistic moments done on a while different level than you may find anywhere else!  My wife and I both agree it's a top three meal that either of us have had in the world and well worth the visit at least once (but ideally multiple times)!!",

After we finished our drink, the waiter opened and old fashion elevator /loading dock door to reveal a cozy dining room.  Food was all on spot. No dish fell flat and were delicious. really enjoyed everything. I rarely can say that about any restaurant. Even alinea there were a few dishes that weren't quite there but were creative. They really speaks for itself. My favorites were the hamachi/caviar starter and the wagyu and squab.  Only gripe, which is expected, was leaving a bit on the nippy side.I will be back the next time.i come back to Chicago.",

Without giving too many spoilers, the whole dinner proved to be much more experiential than anticipated. From the way you enter the restaurant, to the music, to the atmosphere of the dining room - the entire experience was engaging from beginning to end.  The flavors of the food were incredible. Most of the dishes would start out with an initial flavor, shifting mid-bite to a different flavor that somehow always perfectly complimented the initial flavor.  The wait staff was incredible. Very knowledgeable and attentive, but did not come off as pretentious. Each staff member we interacted with came across as genuine and fully engaged to the job at hand.  Lastly, I would highly recommend the spirit free pairing. The drinks provided were out of this world! Pure magic. I swear they had Gandalf himself preparing these sweet potions in the back.  Thank you to the entire Oriole staff. This was an anniversary that we won\u2019t forget!",

Without taking himself or his restaurant too seriously, Chef Noah Sandoval embraces fine dining with both flourish and style.  As we entered this old factory (exposed brick, corrugated freight elevator), we were immediately greeted by name, offered a beverage, and invited to relax into the casual setting.  And then the food arrived.  We were dazzled with course-after-course of an exciting tasting menu.  While we found the earliest courses (sushi and raw fish) too salty -- albeit beautiful  -- the later courses of cooked fish, duck, foie gras, and wagu beef were unparalleled!  It was a full sensory experience, with an emphasis on flavor and taste!  I had a wonderful time, and a wonderful birthday.",

Location is unique and the change from an old factory to a 2 star restaurant is very well done. Food: Incredible food experience, delicious, original, spectacular. There was not a single course we didn't love. Wine: we had the lower end wine pairing which was excellent and very very good. Service: Impecable. Atmosphere: Fantastic.

I also felt a lot of intestinal discomfort right after. The 3 main courses were way too fatty.  The people here place the priority on making art instead of making food. The food looked very beautiful, but that was not the point of dining. The top priority of dining should be the taste. If I wanted to eat a piece of art, I would have been better off eating a statue or drinking some paint.  The tables were way too close together. I feel the people next to me can easily extend their arm and take something off my plate.  So for all the masochists out there looking to burn through $600 for horrible food, I strongly recommend dining at Oriole.",

We also did the standard wine pairing which was good but definitely not as memorable as the non-alcoholic. I cannot say enough good things about Oriole, everything was perfect down to the bread and butter. If I am excited about any restaurant it's this one - can't wait to see what they do in the future and my fingers are crossed for 3 stars.",

It's all kinds of special, from the moment you turn down the dark alley in which they're located. The mystery of what you're about to experience is just as mysterious as their location. I'd like to refer to it as a speak easy of high-end dining.  Once you step inside, your group is greeted with an amazing cocktail. The mood right from the entrance feels like you're in an old 007 movie. The doors splits into two sections. One goes up and one goes down. You're immediately hit with a warm feeling from the absolute perfect ambiance. It's not until you sit down at your table and look around at every detail do you start to really appreciate what you just experienced.  Now the scent from the kitchen  is starting to hit and you're somewhat hypnotized as you peer into the open layout. All the Chefs are so close that I'm sure from any table in the house you're going to have a great view of your amazing plates being prepared. These Chefs are pure geniuses and very talented artists. Every course you experience will continue to leave you wanting more. The descriptions of the courses are like food poetry. It's truly a beautiful journey of life through hundreds of flavors.  I highly recommend the standard wine pairing. You'll see the true art of eating at the Oriole as they pay attention to every single experience you could encounter with your pallet and soul. If you have any kind of food allergy or diet restrictions, they go above and beyond to make sure you have the very best 100% of the time. There's no menu and why should there be with what talent they have in their kitchen.  The staff are so kind, so caring, and work together in perfect synchrony. I watched their staff take such great care of my family and friends in ways you hardly see in other high-end dining restaurants. Even though they have only seating for 28 you can tell that everyone, including the Chefs, have their eyes on you at all times to help make sure you're still having the best experience you could possibly have.  They received two Michelin stars in less than a year of opening. I honestly believe they deserve and will have their third star very soon. I've been here a few times and I'm always impressed. Please don't miss out on this once in a lifetime experience.  Bon App\u00e9tit  Mr. J",

So to speak, we wouldn't be able to enjoy their alcoholic pairing, which sounded and looked spectacular from the guests next to us.  About a month after we made our reservation, Oriole became a new 2 star restaurant in the 2017 Michelin guide. Overall, I am impressed with their presentation and services. However, I felt that the course menu lacked coherences, and the flavors did not connect. Rather than a continuous flow of dishes, I felt like that I was given many tasty plates of tapas. My favorite course was the pasta course- when the chef shaved the white truffle in front of me, the aroma literally hit me in my face. Don't take me wrong, every dish was delicious and on point. Over, I really liked this place, and at the same time, I see the potential for them to reach the next level.",

        "caption": "After being open only a bit more than a month, Oriole is already in contention for best restaurant in Chicago, which also makes it a contender for best in the US.  Nearly every one of our sixteen courses was a home run\u2013so much so that it\u2019s hard to pick standouts. Form the first bit of langoustine topped with caviar, each course offered an impressive array of flavors, sometimes merging into a complex whole, and at other times exploding sequentially on the palate revealing one ingredient after another.  The alteration of courses from rich to refreshing and back again kept our palates fresh. Portion sizes were just right, so that we never felt over-stuffed (although we would have happily consumed another six orders of just about anything we were served!)  Rather than attempt to describe individual courses, which change anyway, let me just list those items that topped those I\u2019ve had at the best Michelin-starred restaurants in the world: Sea urchin, foie gras, Alaskan king crab and Japanese A5 Wagyu. Each of these provided a mind-blowing complexity that forced one to stop and consider what was going on in each bite, and each event on the plate. For example the charred lettuce that accompanied the Wagyu was so phenomenal it almost upstaged the Wagyu, which was the best piece of Wagyu I\u2019ve ever tasted.  As with many tasting menus, the last four courses are desserts, and some members of our party don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth. Let me just say that not one crumb survived. The desserts provided terrific variety, were never cloying, and were paired with wines that had very controlled sugar and acid levels, keeping our palates fresh and interested until the very end.  With only about a dozen tables arranged in ample space, the dining room is stylish yet comfortable. Soothing colors and rough brick walls contrast with retro hanging lamps, and a spotlight on each table shows off the food to its best advantage. A glass wall separates the dining room from the kitchen, although it certainly isn\u2019t needed for noise abatement, as there is no kitchen commotion from the many chefs working their magic.  Service is professional yet welcoming, without the stiff affectations of some top restaurants. We were particularly impressed with our sommelier, whose extensive knowledge and passion for the wines on the tasting fight was matched by his deep understanding of the ingredients in each dish and how they matched his selections.  While Oriole is not inexpensive, it offers an astonishing value given the perfection of the experience.",
