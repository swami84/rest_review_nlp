Cocktails were boozy and our waiter Jason was exceptional. We never had to wait for drinks, appetizers and finally our dinner. Their outdoor dining setup is cozy and inviting. We will definitely be back. Thank you Jason for the great experience!:)",

When we walked by and saw it was open, we stopped in for a drink (always delicious) and picked out a couple of appetizers...pretty. much as a second thought. We had nachos and fries with no expectations. What a surprise. The nachos were unusually prepared and very tasty and satisfying (not the gooey mess I had anticipated). The fries were as they should be,  hand cut, crispy outside with a tender center. Yum. Plan to go back for a real dinner soon. The other attraction is that they have outdoor seating, with distance spacing, in their front courtyard. The feeling is more like being in a restaurant than eating on the street. Enjoy!",

We called to say we were a few minutes late for our reservation but were right around the corner and they said it was no issue. When we arrived we were asked to wait for a minute so we waited by the door which was right next to an open table. After about 5 minutes a waitress came up and said \"oh, you can just sit at that table\" (the same one that had been open since we walked in) The waitress ended up being helpful with wine choices but was very passive aggressive at every interaction.

For example, I was struggling a bit to find the entrance because it\u2019s set back from the street, and the host jogged after me to show me in. It was raining and I was wet and they offered me towels. The food was also great. I had the restaurant week menu of peach burrata (perfect and fresh), pasta, and the cookie dough egg roll. We also tried the Brussel sprouts and seasonal lettuces. I can\u2019t remember the name of the cocktail I got but it was perfect. I\u2019d say expect to spent about $30-40 a head. I would definitely go again.",

If you ever come to Park Slope, don't blink, you might miss where it is tucked away! The location is great. The outdoor dining area feels so relaxing. There is no music just the sounds of the day. Whether that is by choice or because of the close proximity of houses nearby, it was a nice atmosphere to start. The weather was just a bit to hot for us so we asked if we could move inside which our server was more than happy to do. Once inside the restaurant you automatically feel relaxed. The lighting levels were perfect and they had music playing from my generation so I felt at ease! We did not know that it was restaurant week when we arrived so we had to wait at the bar for a table to clear. My wife and I did not have to wait to be greeted by the bartender who, without asking, brought us chilled glasses of water. The service here is exceptional. Jason (the bartender) was very professional and kind in allowing us the time to preview over their drink menu. I am a Gin aficionado...long story short I had the best (10 stars) Gin martini that I have had in a while. My wife had a glass of wine and we were set. Once seated, Nathan our server treated us like we were the only two in the restaurant. Sea scallops are out of this world delicious; the lobster bisque = amazing and their signature benchmark burgers are the top of the line.  Thank you benchmark for helping us relax and enjoy our last dining out in Brooklyn! We will be back.",

When there was one last piece, the wife and I were both eyeing before deciding to be civil and share.  This place snuck up on us.  We knew were going to get good food, but this was lip smacking, eye rolling, I-may-want-my-last-meal-here-before-i-die good.  Our server was awesome too.  Calm, cool, collected - he knew when to come to us without making us feel rushed.  Oh, and a bit of good natured warning - their Benchmark Bloody Mary was STRONG.  I don't mean that in a bad way either - it made for an damn good drink, and you know they weren't stingy with the booze.  All in all  it really was a great experience and pleasure to go there again.

Now, let's talk about the service... extremely attentive and not at all intrusive...the bus boy, was on top of our beverage needs the entire time, and not once did I have to search for our waitress or our bus boy on the floor, they worked like poetry in motion, and it was actually a pleasure to see them work together.  Now let's talk about the ambiance - first class...whether you're sitting outside in the garden or dining inside (I recommend inside) only because it feels a little like a naughty speakeasy...it's warm, inviting and the seating is oh so comfortable.

He immediately catered to our son. Without asking he told us they have chicken fingers and fries or pasta with butter and cheese for him because it's not on the menu. Our steak and chicken was delicious and was the perfect portion. My husband ordered the bread pudding. Nick brought the bread pudding and a birthday cookie dough spring roll for our son. The cookie dough spring roll was to die for!! Thanks Nick for making our dinner the best dining experience we've had this weekend",

They just stack everything in top of each other ( filet mignon on top of asparagus, on top of mashed potatoes.... why!? ).  Dessert was a lie. The lava cake was completely over cooked (no lava to be found) and the vol au vent was a joke.  Not a single time were we asked if everything was alright.  Oh, and it was $87 per person, no drinks included, not even a coffee.  Food was ok to good but boring, service was bad, price was ridiculous.  Dont get me wrong, we are regulars and when you come for their $18 prix fixe for brunch the value is amazing.

The sides, mac and cheese, hand cut fries and brussel sprouts , were also tasty, but the brussel sprouts were a little tough, I prefer a small pasta over the shells they used for the mac and cheeses, but overall, I still have to give this experience 5 stars.

A couple of moments after we sat down, a family with young kids were seated next to us. We really wanted a quiet dinner, so we politely asked the manager to seat us an empty table across the room. They were able to do it and menus were brought. The waiter was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was very well versed in the menu and was able to suggest the perfect dishes that would make our night. We ordered the Trio of Short Ribs, Assorted Cheese Plate, Burger and Tuna. We also brought our own wine -- They charge a $30 corking fee. The food was absolutely phenomenal and well priced. They cooked the burger at a perfect medium rare and the tuna at a perfect rare. (Makes me happy because some places just really screw up the temperature). Overall it was a lovely night, great company and great food.",

Both spaces are lovely and in slightly cooler temps, I'd be outside. We started with the Saxelby cheese plate which delicious, save for the blue cheese I'll never eat, along with the foie gras. Both were delicious and plates were definitely cleaned before moving onto the filet mignon entrees. I ordered my steak medium and it was definitely more on the medium-rare side, which was OK. Wonderfully seasoned and delicious despite my request to be prepared with butter or oil.  This is definitely a great place for date night but not too date-sy that you feel uncomfortable if you're not there on a date.The staff was very attentive, helpful and friendly. I'll be returning for the cheeseburger and mac and cheese!",

The service was great, I could barely put down my water glass after a sip before it was filled again. Some visitors might find this too attentive but as someone who drinks a lot of water it was absolutely perfect. I'm sure once I revisit this place again the three star rating will become four.",

It's definitely got good steak, good brunch, good brews at the bar and some other things on the menu have been great too.  I also really like the location - nice decor and a good sized outdoor space.  But there are parts that seem pretty unreliable - e.g. deserts are hit or miss, appetizers are hit or miss, service is hit or miss, wait times are unpredictable, etc.  I wouldn't come here for a special occasion where the expectations are high, but if you come for steak or brunch it's pretty reliable, and if you don't mind taking a gamble it'll surprise you sometimes.",

The downside: The service was good, not great and definitely needs improvement. I made reservations earlier in the week and they didn't have it when I arrived. I wasn't thrilled (it was our anniversary) but they gave us a table anyway. It took about ten minutes to take our drink orders and another ten for the drinks to arrive. Besides that hiccup, the service was good for the remainder of the evening. Verdict: Definitely worth going to for the food alone. I'm sure as the restaurant develops they will fix the minor service issues. It's definitely not appropriate for a restaurant of that caliber.",
