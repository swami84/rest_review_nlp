        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Today Dad went to visit this place on his birthday, but was very disappointed because when ordering, the waiter asked us if we ordered some seafood and recommended swimming shrimp. We asked the price of swimming shrimp for one pound. The waiter informed 23.95 and we ordered Pounds. After serving, I found that the amount of swimming shrimp is asymmetric, only 6 or 2 in the eyes, and the waiter theory, but the other party said that you come to the restaurant for some swimming shrimp. One pound is only 6 or 72 servings, because they weigh Including the weight of water, I stopped because my father did n\u2019t want to be noisy on his birthday. Later, my father wanted to eat egg wraps because there was no price on the menu. We also asked about the price. The other party told us that it was 8.95. The scrambled eggs are full of cauliflower. Well, because of Dad \u2019s birthday, we do n\u2019t want everyone to be unhappy, and once again compromised, and finally paid the money. Dad counted on his mobile phone, but how to calculate it still charged ten yuan more, and later checked the bill and found that the swimming shrimp 23.95 changed. It was 28.95, and the theory was again with the other party. In the end, I came over and did n\u2019t know whether it was the boss or the manager. I changed the price from 8.95 to 10.95 and the fried bean sprouts 12.95 to 13.95. Then I said that the waiter calculated the wrong money. After the change, the price was calculated again, which happened to be the price we had paid before. In the end, we could only leave with anger. I think it \u2019s most important to open a door to do business. It \u2019s too bad to change the price code in front of customers. It \u2019s just a black shop. Anyway, this shop wo n\u2019t be patronized anymore.
