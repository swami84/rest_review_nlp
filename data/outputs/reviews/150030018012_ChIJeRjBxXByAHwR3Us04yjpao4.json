Moana grill serves simple bar food, menu not as fleshed out as Tiki\u2019s in the next block. However, they make up in tranquil atmosphere. Servers are genuinely conversational, not fake as in most other places. We liked talking to our server, Michael. We had Mai Tais, not very strong but strong enough. Onion rings and fish tacos were excellent. Live music is great, it\u2019s not too loud, it\u2019s mellow and appropriate for dining ambience. Loved it all. I wish we had discovered Moana grill sooner.  Ps. Plastic cups are probably an insurance/Marriott policy requirement as the bar is within the swimming pool area. This was not something I cared about.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) The view and the band of Waikiki Beach are good, but it's hard to stop and stop the staff. For the price, the food ... Maybe it's more happy to drink during the happy hour or just late. If you stay at the Marriott, you may get a Maitai ticket so you may go there. Rubber flow was delicious.

Throughout evening we had to look for her and place orders...she added her own gratuity to the bill; we couldn't understand that, as the bill holder contained a notice stating they didn't include gratuity?? Sunset & music nice - food not so good, drinks way over priced. It just wasn't the same as I remembered this place 10 years ago",

Multiple people have walked by numerous times... was really hoping this would be a great hang out place while we stay at the marriot. To my disappointment it's not at all. The live music is a plus. Finally a server made it our way and we just ordered our drinks.. hopefully they arrive soon... guess it's time to check out other options in the area, not that it's limited at all... :)",

We had two different servers and were practically ignored the entire time. On both occasions, it took nearly 30 minutes to order a drink. We would sit with empty drinks and empty plates for at least 15 minutes before she came by to check on us. In fact, she even served us the wrong drink in our pineapple. The drinks were good, we were just hoping for better service when paying nearly $100 for two entrees and three cocktails total.",
