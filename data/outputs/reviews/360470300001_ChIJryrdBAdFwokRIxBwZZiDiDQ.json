Reaction went to another level here...)  For service, we had to ask three times for everything (including check) with different people...  When I said we had to pack the rest to go, lady said \"it's ok...\" after I said we are late for next meeting  she again said it's ok and then left our table.... Eh???? That was a interesting experience.  Bottom line, I would only order to-go for desserts. \ud83e\udd7a",

Street parking only, but that's how that section of Brooklyn works. I Highly recommend their garlic chicken! They sell out early in the day because it's such a popular dish. And because it's always fresh they run out fast. Also, their chicken roti (sp?) appetizer and pad thai main entree are my go to favorites. Like, every time. And a thai iced tea to top it off. The staff are friendly, and most speak English (white girl in the Asian section of Brooklyn, I need that lol). They're always very kind and the food is always delicious and fresh. And they're clean, which is always super important to me.",

Sometimes a little pushy to order more food which I would gladly do to try all their food but it would be way too much. Food is Awesome and Cheap. We paid $30-40 for a big meal for 4 ppl.

However, we ran out of places to eat locally, and finally decided to give this place another go.  The food here is decent but I remember it being more tasty. If you're allergic to shrimp, look elsewhere because they put shrimp in everything; even though I requested, nicely, no shrimp - or my sister's bf will die.  Our go to dishes are the roti canai (Indian pancake), hainanese chicken, and a surang burung (taro nest).  The same lady took our order. I learned that if you're quick with your decisions, she is tolerable. I'm sorry, I know she may be somebody's mother. Just be sure of what you want! Or she will get impatient. Service can definitely improve, but we came in with a group of 7 and left with 6 full stomachs and 1 less full, but as long as his airway is clear, no complaints!  PS. If they recommend the fish, let the waitress know - \"you good\".",

THIS is probs the best thing you can get here. The sauce that comes with this dish is sooooo gooood. You can probs get an extra loaf of bread, eat it with the sauce, and be GOOD.  Ceviche - this is just alright. I probs wouldn't say it's my favorite though. The ceviche is pretty fresh!  Lamb special - I really enjoyed this dish as the lamb was perfectly tender and seasoned! I was actually surprised at how good this dish was. It also came with rice & beans, and a really yummy yogurt sauce for the meat  Calamari - can't go wrong with the calamari here..  Usually you have to wait to get seated but the bar area is first come first serve so I've never really had to wait more than 15 minutes around dinner time!",

I ordered my usual roti canai(Indian pancake) and char kway teow(rice strip noodles) with shrimp.  The noodles had surprising wok hay, which is Cantonese for the sweet spot reached when cooking food in a wok on high heat.  The char kway teow had 5 shrimp in it.  I counted because that's how many I spit out.  You can tell when shrimp isn't fresh when it is so chalky that it melts in your mouth.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried all of them before saying anything.  Out of all the staff that waited on us, only one had a friendly demeanor.  The rest had the \"if you don't like it, take a hike\" attitude. I happened to flag one of the nasty ones down, explained the situation, and proceeded to hear the funniest explanation.  She said that ALL the seafood is shipped fresh daily and that it should all be fresh. In fact, when I pointed at the chewed up shrimp I spat out, she said there's always bound to be one that's spoiled.  When I countered that none were edible, thereby disproving her previous statement, she shrugged her shoulders and strutted away.  Way to go, I love watching people walk away from me.  Now watch as I never return to your restaurant.",

The Jumbo mango prawns - They were not terrible, however they did not remove the vein nor the outer shell?? I expected more for a 25 dollar dish.  The fried red snapper - Horrendous, The fish was encased in mush.. It was nauseating, the fish itself tasted like soap.  Just thinking back of the experience is making my stomach turn, This is not authentic Malaysian cuisine and they should have paid us to dine here.  Side note, The chop sticks are made of wood and are reused. We know this because they were served to us dirty, and with bite marks.  From what I understand, this venue used to be great until some sort of change happened and everything went downhill. It is clear the changes in the cooking staff.  Never again",

        "caption": "A miserable experience at best. The service was below abysmal. The manager woman and the waitresses/ staff all seem like they are on edge about something. Shuffling around with really angry faces. The upside of the service is that when you're really hungry, your food comes out immediately. The downside is that it really comes out IMMEDIATELY. That means it could come before the appetizer, and it could mean that it could come out 15 minutes before the rest of the table gets their food. The staff can barely speak a word of english, and when you get your plate before the rest of the table, you've no idea when the rest of it is coming out.  We got some 'Prawn Mee' (\"Nyonya's Favorite\"), which tasted like salty- rotten fish soup. I understand it's a prawn soup, but believe me when I tell you, the soup was spoiled. Horribly bitter fishy- after taste, with a miserable attempt to be covered up by probably 3 tablespoons of chili powder per tablespoon of soup. Almost had a fizzy ness to it. We attempted to send it back to try the Java Mee, but they refuse to take it back. The manager came out - Angry asian woman- (In terrible broken english): YOU ORDAH PRAWN SOUP, IT TAST-UH SPICY YOU PAY! EVERYBODY GET-A THIS ONE AND THEY PAY, YOU PAY. YOU NO RETURN. YOU PAY. Me: Uh, miss. I've had prawn soup before, please taste it. It's spoiled. Manager: NO I DONT CARE, YOU PAY, YOU EAT. YOU NO RETURN. Turns around and walks back to the kitchen.  Sorry for the word salad. This was just a very upsetting experience. I've never gotten so angry in a restaurant before, and also never wrote a review, but i couldn't live this one down. Don't eat here, they're mean people with bad soup.",

Another good thing to get is the coconut rice. It's great with the curry sauce that comes with the Roti. Just ask for more. Service is quick and easy, the decor is beautiful, especially with the real bamboo ramps, and the food both plentiful and exquisite. Certainly one of the best Asian restauraunts I have ever stepped foot in.",
