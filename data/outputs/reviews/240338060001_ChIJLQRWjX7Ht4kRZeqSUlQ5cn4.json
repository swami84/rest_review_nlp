I ordered the prime burger .. but it was missing the prime rib meat.. it had two slices, complete false advertisement in comparison to the picture. I ate half my burger before the manager brought me some. I wasnt bothered until she hesitantly handed me the \"extra\" meat she was bringing me. holding it in front of me, explaining how people believe it should be more meat because of the picture, and how it should only be 3 oz. A portion... when she never even saw what I originally received and tried to argue with me .. I almost told her I didn't want it anymore, but took it to not be rude..  my second experience the food was better, no complaints, except my server kept forgetting what we ordered and came back several times for us to remind her. Sometimes I felt she completely forgot about us.. despite the experiences I'll probably return just because the food was decent for the price. So I guess it's TRUE. You get what you pay for.",

Then a decline began, its natural as restaurants move forward, but then I ordered from here and got food poisoning. I can't be sure it was from here specifically, but It made me wary to order again. Tonight all I wanted was a pretzel and remembered they had one on the menu so decided to take a chance, well delivery comes, everything is meh on quality and of course pretzel was missing, so the only reason I tried again was for that item left out.

Our group of 10+ were enjoying celebratory shots when we were told that we had ordered too many drinks in too short a time. While I understand the responsibility of the business to monitor such things, it was a turn off to a first time guest. I assume that because my friend is a manager, no other managers came by to talk to us about the situation (I get it). She explained the situation though.... food to alcohol to time ratio.
