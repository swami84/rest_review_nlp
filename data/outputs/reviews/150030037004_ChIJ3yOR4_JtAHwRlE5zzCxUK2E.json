The building was easy to find with plenty of out-front parking spots, even for a weekend morning (9ish). Walking in we noticed the shop truly looks like an experience with seemingly a fair amount of space to meet up with friends or study. The friendly baristas quickly made our tasty lattes. We enjoyed sitting on the lanai. The breakfast sandwich I ordered was fine, just a tad salty for my liking. Overall, wish I found this place sooner and looking forward to my next visit!",

I really recommend that they make the minimal addition to indicate on the menu what's vegan or veganizable, it would make it even more inviting. :-)",

I had no idea what was hidden in this gem of a location.  It was definitely worth the stop and wish I had done it sooner.  There are some notable points about this place.  It has lots of parking and a good number under the shade of trees.  The location is large and has a comfortable feel to relax and enjoy your cup of joe. They have outdoor seating if you should want to see watch the street activity. The coffee is roasted onsite and the pastries are made there as well.  I found the staff to be very friendly and professional.  They were attentive and did their job well.  I felt appreciated for my business and presences unlike some places just whipping out your order and barely making eye contact with you and not even saying \"thank you\"  My coffee order was made perfectly and presented elegantly with care.  The desserts were also incredible.  There was so many good looking sweets, I didn't know what to go for.  That is all the more reason for me to return and I do plan to.  A couple other things to point out about this location.  They have a lot of space and different seating options, so if you have a group, this is a good place to go.  I noticed a good number of people working on their laptops and tablets, so I think there is a fair number of college students doing their studies there quietly. Their menu also offers food options for breakfast and lunch, so they do have a larger menu other than just coffee and pastries.  If you are in the area, it is worth the stop. Go check it out.",

Because it is sweet, the combination with Cold brew was just right. Coffee is roasted at the center of the shop and the inside of the shop is filled with the smell of coffee. Japanese people came to the corner selling beans and tea leaves. The wall art outside the shop is also wonderful. Perhaps the most accessible is the public The Bus.

Conveniently located directly across the street from the Hawaiian convention Center.  I enjoyed the atmosphere on their outside deck, though the birds can be a little forward with their requests for food. The coffee roaster is right in the middle of the primary dining room and you can watch the techs at work. Lunch was delicious and fresh, but for the price was definitely smaller portions than I'm used to on the islands (pictured is the chicken salad sandwich with a side salad, the dressing was amazing & the breakfast burrito with a side of white BBQ sauce - an add on recommended by the barista and the Waikiki smoothie). All good.  Overall a great spot for a snack or a caffeinated kick in the butt for your morning or mid afternoon grind. \ud83e\udd19",

It is located just west of downtown Honolulu and was the best coffee we had during our trip to Oahu. When we arrived we were greeted with a cheerful smile. We checked out the coffee production related displays and then watched as one of the coffee roasters worked his magic on the beans. He was happy to chat with us about his process. I ordered an espresso and a traditional cappuccino and enjoyed them on the patio.  The espresso was good and the cappuccino well done. There are a few other specialty coffee shops that do coffee well, but this was probably the best coffee I had while on Oahu.",
