Ok so I'm still a beginner at eating sushi but am quickly developing an appreciation for sushi...especially the tuna rolls. I was searching for a good sushi place tonight to eat at here in Tampa with my friends and came across Ebisu. Was a bit hesitant coming here at first understanding that it is a small house size restaurant and I am social distancing but I honestly felt very safe eating here during the pandemic. The parking lot is a bit cramped but I had a very good gut feeling upon walking upto this Tampa gem from my car. It's a Friday evening and there was a crowd of people at the door. I explained to them that I am waiting for 2 more friends to show up and they held down a area at the sushi bar for them to arrive...at that point I knew I was in for a great Friday evening. The customer service here is top notch...literally couldnt be any better! Especially on a busy Friday night...our server Don (give him a pay raise please!) really went out of his way to make sure we had a great first time experience and he even helped me with a couple items on the menu. He also said one of the drinks I ordered may not be possible to make that night and I was understanding as it is a drink that takes time. I ordered a Sake Sangria...and I was so happy when he brought it to me. Don really put a smile to my face. And I haven't even gotten started on the food...AMAZING!!! I ordered takoyaki for a appetizer and it literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. My friend ordered hot sake...I've had cold sake but never hot and it was so smooth. We had fun taking shots together and went through 3 bottles of it between the 3 of us...it was the best Sake I ever had. My friend ordered the daily special: the spider roll. It comes with softshell crab. I never had softshell crab before so was a little skeptical but when I tried it I was blown away by how delicious and crispy and flavorful it is. I myself ordered the Godzilla roll and the electric roll. Literally out of this world and I'm pretty sure the wasabi they use is the real deal wasabi and not the fake stuff you find at supermarkets which is just horseradish. The sushi is so good I had to order a 3rd roll...just a classic spicy tuna roll and Don informed me that the spicy sauce they use is made in house...unbelievable...such awesome food and top notch service which seems to be hard to find these days. I fell in love with Ebisu...my friends and I had such a great experience here and also they are kid friendly...they have a 1 year old son together and without even asking Don brought a high chair for the little one. I know it's a very long review but I havent had such a great experience at a restaurant like I did tonight in a very long time. I will definitely be back and bringing more people here. Ebisu is now my go to place whenever I get a craving for sushi. Thank you Ebisu Sushi shack \ud83d\ude42",

He ordered 3 rolls (a volcano and two others) When he returned home the volcano roll was replaced with a different roll with eel in it. My husband doesn\u2019t like eel so he would never order that- plus the main thing we were looking forward to was the volcano roll. My husband called back to ask for the correct roll. At first the man on the phone wanted him to bring in the eel roll to exchange, which was fine. The man in the phone then called back saying he found his order and claimed that my husband did order an Alaskan roll. My husband explained to him that he must\u2019ve misheard him because he would never order a roll with eel. The man refused to take responsibility for the order and told us we can pay for the volcano roll. My husband said no thank you and if you don\u2019t want to take responsibility for your mistake then I won\u2019t be ordering from you again- to which he replied \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d.

They were pretty swamped when we went the other night, but it's such a unique place it wasn't so bad. I got some delicious 18% premium sake along with one of their spicy rolls with sriracha and a jalapeno and that was money. We also tried their edamame with a spicy garlic sauce on it, and my wife loved it!  These people are nailing it. Pretty cool idea. My only thing would be, I wish our waiter was just a touch more personable. He was a great dude, but it felt like he was rushing around so much that he didn't have time to connect a ton. Either way, 5 stars for a great place.",

There are a few appetizers here that I haven't seen anywhere else and they're awesome!! The sushi is pretty normal, slightly smaller selection than some spots but it's always fresh and nicely made. It's a small spot so if you have a larger group go on a weeknight. If your group is larger than 8 you may want to consider going elsewhere because you'll take up half the seats in the restaurant LOL Love the 80s video game decor!",

No.  Instead, the owner/chef decided to approach me at a busy Publix and proceed to berate me for the yelp review.  She was saying that I should have taken what her husband said as a compliment because her son is, and these are her words not mine, \u201csmart and beautiful\u201d. She refused to let me get a word in trying to explain myself and why I DID NOT TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT. I mean, do any of you guys go up to an Asian person and say they look like Lucy Liu or Jackie Chan? She was not there when her husband said that to me. She could not possibly know how I processed his inflection. (Drunk; laughing after the comment. Even her son looked uncomfortable about it) Then it just sounded like she just wanted to hear herself talk after she kept interrupting me so I walked away.  It wasn\u2019t \u201cretaliation\u201d for her husband\u2019s sister leaving a review where I work. This was my personal experience and despite where I work, when I walk through your doors I am a customer.  You could have apologized. I would have taken the review down. But instead you said I didn\u2019t deserve to be Asian. I am proud of my heritage and your comment along with your husband\u2019s is one I will absolutely not tolerate. You are beyond redemption for what you said to me in that Publix.  Do not approach me again or I will call the police.",

They also always have specials from time to time that you normally wouldn\u2019t find on the menu, including special rolls and other traditional Japanese dishes. We always, always get the Agedashi Tofu as an appetizer. During the winter months they have rolled out a more traditional, non-sushi menu, which was amazing (I hope they do it again)!

There is not a lot of seating, but we arrived early enough in the evening (we have two little kids), so we were able to be seated right away.  Every piece of sushi was FILLED, we kept remarking on the size and deep maroon color of the tuna inside the tuna roll.  The rice is just enough to wrap the sushi, they don't layer it on thick like some other restaurants.  The Red Dragon (fried shrimp and avocado roll, topped with tuna, scallions, spicy mayo and eel sauce) was fantastic.  The Electric Eye (spicy tuna and avocado roll, topped with fresh salmon, jalepeno and siracha sauce) may be my new favorite.  We also had a spicy tuna roll, the spicy tuna looked hand chopped - there were nice-sized pieces of tuna in the spicy mayo.  Yes, definitely try this place.  Two others that we love are Sushi Ninja on Kennedy (they also serve amazing Korean- if you like spicy, the spicy pork bulgogi is one we always get), and Sushi House in Ybor.",

We debated finding another place since we had to be up very early but we were realistic about what to expect at any restaurant on a Saturday night. However our food came out within 20 minutes and it was soooo good! We would have been very happy even if it had taken that full time. I will be back any time I'm in Tampa and we've already started spreading the word to our friends. Go here!!",

Sushi rolls (when pieced back together) are noticably shorter than, and the final bill costs the same as, Blue Samarai, SoHo Sushi, Sushi Ninja, etc.  For two people eating at a sushi restaurant on Nebraska Av, three rolls and a pot of hot green tea should cost around $28 (not $40).  It would also be nice if the sushi was garnished with exotic sauces like other restaurants.  Ebisu has a cozy dining room, and we'll probably visit again, but it still needs to make a few tweaks before it can live up to its potential.",

I have been here seven times in two months.  Their sushi is really outstanding and also reasonably priced. They have a nice beer and wine selection. The music isn't too loud, and the kitchen is quiet (the proximity of the kitchen to dining room is small). The restaurant is also clean (bathrooms too).  Yes, this place is small and can get crowded during peak times, but their size adds to their local neighborhood atmosphere (this isn't a chain located next to a mall). It is also one of the few places that is wheelchair accessible and the seating plan allows for a nice flow. There is a light with a sensor in the parking lot in the back, amd additional parking available (parking isnt always easy in Seminole Heights).  The porch area is pet friendly, and the staff is nice. I agree that there are times when service is lacking, but there are two servers who have been here since this restuarant has opened, and they provide excellent service. I will continue to come here for sushi, and would recommend this place for anyone looking for great sushi that is reasonably priced (this is also a great place if you're looking for take out!!)",

The sushi rolls were dry as could be and the shrimp was fried to a dark brown crisp. Roll tasted like chicken nuggets . Tuna roll was dry and lacked flavor . Hope they revamp with some better quality  sushi .",

The first experience we had issues finding a parking place and once we got inside it was noisey and hectic. There were no open tables so we turned around and decided to try again another night. The second try we greeted by a very nice man who saw that there were no open seats and went and made room for us at the bar. We waited at the bar for about ten minutes and never received a menu or even spoke to a waiter or waitress. It has tons of potential but at the moment i think they have a lot of kinks they need to work out. Not rude people but definately in over their head.",
