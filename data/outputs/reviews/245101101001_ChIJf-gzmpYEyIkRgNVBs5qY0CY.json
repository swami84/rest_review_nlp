They forgot my soda that was supposed to come with the combo too. At least the pizza had two different types of cheeses so it was tasty and jumbo wings were terrific.

It\u2019s one of the few places that is open after I get off work, and I don\u2019t have to worry about it taking hours for my food to get delivered. However long they tell you it will take, it takes less than that time usually. Awesome place. Couldn\u2019t ask for more.",

When my boyfriend asked if she could make our food again since it wasn\u2019t our fault, she was rude and told him he would have to wait another 45+ minutes for the food to be ready. We were so hungry that we didn\u2019t want to wait that long so he asked for a refund. Had to wait 20 minutes for that woman to start processing a refund. Definitely not coming back or recommend.

My second order , was taken by a rude poorly, speaking man ,I went over the order multiple times, and had him read it back to me. My party wings were cooked too long, and the honey mustard was small amount on the bottom of the pan, the 12\" subs were to be one with hots and one without. the sub with out hots was marked as marked hots. I can say that the extra large pizzas were fresh and and delicious . Did I read a review about rats? If so . We need to know.",

My wifes sandwich was supposed to be no olives (because she is allergic) as instructed in the special instructions. Both our sandwiches were wrong (hers had olives) and the fries were cold. Called and got the food corrected, picked it up and looked it over real quick, looked alright. Got home and my wifes sandwich tasted strongly of olives, with some olives still being in the sandwich. They obviously just tried to pick them out. I dont know what part of no olives or allergic, they didnt understand. Called again and they told me to come back for a 3rd time and they'd remake it. I had no faith in that so I asked for a refund just for my wifes sandwich, which I was told I would be refunded. Staff at the counter was understanding and that is the only reason they deserve 1 star.",

After 90 minutes of waiting, I called back, only to find out that my order wasn't being remade, that they had sent a driver out with just a cup of sauce, and that he should be here \"any minute\". I was put on with who I can only assume is the manager, and he proceeded to talk over me the entire time I tried  to tell him my entire issue.

Those wings might be the best I ever had! Crispy, juicy, perfectly cooked. I think they threw in extra wings for the long wait, and they were pretty big to begin with. We had a lot leftover.

Which is why what happened tonight is so very sad for us \ud83d\ude25 We have ordered, happily, from the spot for about 6 months now and Everytime we have ordered it's been great! Deliciousness-wise lol. They tell you about 45 mins to an hour, they are underestimating by about at least 10 extra mins, like I said something is forgotten last time it was honey mustard (and I really LIKE that shiZ) and tonight they screwed up my boyfriend's whole pizza. I called, it seemed resolved and the even said he would have them make & deliver it on the fly for us...we have never ever complained before... Well to make a long annoying story short, it took almost 2 1/2 hrs to get a small cheese pizza remade and delivered, not to mention 3 different phone calls with 3 different people. Ufffgh. So yes, if u wanna risk it, if nothing bad happens, hey, congrats and enjoy! But don't say you haven't been warned!",

It's the spot where I can usually go late night when I'm having a craving and where I can mostly depend on getting good food ESPECIALLY pizza! (the fries are great too)  It functions as a convenience store as well as a take out spot where you can get eats such as wings or pizza.  The staff is usually pleasant though often busy so I wouldn't be so upset if they seem a bit pushy. If you ever catch them during a slower time you'll often find a bit of humor tossed across the counter every now and then.  Arguably some of the best pizza I've had in the area though a little on the expensive side (I'm talking almost $2 for a topping of onions), still worth the price for its quality, freshness, and taste. They even deliver to more questionable areas in the neighborhood to a definite plus.  Try the spot if you ever need a late night fix. You I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

Cute young girl with a lil voice that is so nice & what could easily be an uncle to her, grumpy but nice guy that works hard. Other than that the kitchen is a complete disaster. Unorganized and complete chaos that's visible even from a customers view point. Example? Just tonight I decided to order the simplest thing on the menu before going to my part time job. Got the order placed at 10:38 pm & wound up late for work after having to wait till 11:10 pm. It was a simple order of gravy fries. An Uber driver came to pick up an order that  kitchen would neither confirm nor deny that they had after both of the counter staff asked. Uber driver had to throw his hands in the air and chalk it up to wasted time, energy & gas. The owners clearly do not care about this place as it falls apart. I honestly have to say if it weren't for weed bringing on people's munchies they would have been out of business some time ago. Be ready to pack more than one bowl because your food will be, cold, burnt, missing 1/2 the toppings and late!!",

It was my go-to for dine-in and delivery, several times a week. At the top of my list of recommendations to friends. Incredible pizza, and wow the subs, for half the price of anywhere else. Free delivery! And amazing service!  Trust me, I've been a loyal customer for quite awhile and believe me when I say that the restaurant must have endured a catastrophic ownership change over the past year. \ud83e\udd28  The Spot as of today.... I guess maybe the pizza is okaaay.... just okay... unless you decide to get delivery (subtract two stars and add a few bucks to your bill). Either keep your oven preheated while you wait for an hour and a half to recieve cold food at your doorstep that is just five short blocks away from their kitchen or wave bye bye to the pizza guy with an empty tummy. You'll find that when you try to get the order straight, that no one will dash back to get you what you paid for, you'll be advised to come in person if you want to complain. The manager can't even squeeze out a coupon for free breadsticks. I admit I am guilty of giving the place maybe three more tries, dining in and ordering out, hoping against hope that things were going to go back to normal---because, \ud83d\ude2f, MY \"GEM\"!!! But today's delivery, which they got terribly wrong (minus a topping, a size too small---again... which also happens when you try to dine in... and the staff mistreats you when you bring it back to the counter)----is in my own oven right now... No more for me! Domino's started delivering to my building. Think I'll give them a try.\ud83e\udd17  RIP: The Spot",

Ever. I mean, seriously, the cashier was so dejected. I felt terrible for her. I came looking for a late night nosh and left feeling awful for anyone in their employ.  It's easier said than done, I know, but really. Especially on a Saturday night/Sunday morning? Find a way to staff your place.

Also the place doubles as a small super market to pick up things like paper towels and I find that adorable",

Woman on the phone did not cover the phone or put me on hold to speak to her coworkers, saying \"this b***h wants her food where is it?\" She then proceeded to have a full conversation with them where it was made clear that the order had been lost and not fulfilled. However, when she came back on the phone, she straight up lied to me and said that my food was on its way and that the driver would arrive with it momentarily. It arrived at 10:10 and was obviously frozen food that had been heated up. My boyfriend got sick. Almost 3 hours is waaay too long to wait for awful food and rude service.",

I placed an order online via Grub Hub for a chicken caesar wrap, and neglected to add croutons in the comment section. The girl who answered the phone REFUSED to add croutons, telling me I had tro do it through Grub Hub and that there was an extra charge. When I explained to her that I went back and added it through Grub Hub and that there was not an extra charge , despite her insistence that there would be. At that point she still flat out refused to add croutons, and when I asked to speak to a manager she told me she was one. The owner of this business needs to fire her, and better train the employees. Good, or at the very least decent, customer service is what keeps you alive in the restuarant industry,  by way of repeat business and WOM referrals, no matter how good your food may be,  you can not treat customers like this. Over maybe 8 croutons, they just lost a potential repeat customer, and gained negative online advertising",

Not only do I not recommend eating here but we will also stop distributing these menus at my desk.  I intend to call all my colleagues at other hotels to alert them as well. BROTHER'S PIZZA or MASSEY's is a much better option  Edit : To their credit they brought the cash back the next night, along with some wings, so I slightly increased the rating.

        "caption": "I suppose that management has changed. I understand that mistakes happen but. Here's the circumstance: The order was placed at 10:57pm for delivery. The driver delivered the food and the order was paid in cash. While checking the food, I noticed my wings were missing and informed the driver. I also checked my subs and one was completely incorrect. I called the spot and they said another driver will be bringing wings and the sub. A driver arrived but only had the wings. I contacted the spot again and they said \"well why don't you just eat the sub and ask for a discount for next time\". (1. I ordered what I ordered with my money because THAT'S what I wanted. Not what you all mistaking gave me.  2. They wouldn't have ever honored giving me a discount if I mentioned it another time and the order should be free, honestly.) At this point, they're frustrated with me because I still want my sub so they aggressively told me the driver is on the way and hung up quickly. I called every 20 minutes because no one had arrived. At this point, it's almost 1am which is their closing time. I continued to call and they'd continue to say, in a disrespectful tone, the driver is on the way. I tried to be patient...until it was 1:45. I chose to go directly to the spot and find out what's going on. I also got in contact with the driver who informed me that the spot never gave him anymore orders to send out. (What was the point of lying and keeping me waiting for nothing?) I spoke with the (rude) associates and they told me to talk to the manager the next morning. While this was an inconvenience to me, I still made my way there.  At this point, I requested for a refund for the sub which is extremely fair to them because the entire order should've been free since it was wrong and late. They tried their best to get over on me, claiming that they cannot give me the money back and looking down on the situation. (If the situation was different and I received the food and did not pay, they'd take their measures to get that owed money for me. It's all about fairness.) It took for me to get loud to get my money. Never going there again.",
