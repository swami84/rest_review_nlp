We ordered beef goulash and potato leek soup; they were delicious and big serving size too. For the entrees, we got the pork tenderloin and pork schnitzel; one entree was enough to feed two people. The sauce was delicious, just a bit too much salt on the meat for me.  Customer service was wonderful. Definitely give this place a try if you want German food.",

They hand cook everything at the time of order so don't expect fast food, but you can count on great food. The owners, Fred and Amber treat everyone like family, welcoming every guest with a smile. They make rounds to each table to ensure each guest has a positive dining experience. \u00a0 Our waiter, Dean provided exemplary table service from start to finish. This was our first time eating here, and we are not familiar with German fare. He took the time to explain the dishes we were interested in, and also recommended some favorites from the menu. For the appetizers we chose the fried camembert (which came with fried parsley and jam) and the mushroom truffle pierogies. Both were outstanding. Our main course was the Wurst sampler, which we shared. Each wurst was unique and delicious, the sides/mustards complimented every bite perfectly. Gracious hosts, delicious food and good conversation. Thanks for a delightful evening, we will definitely be back!",

We both ordered the prime ribs ...and I ordered mine medium rare. When the waiter arrived with our dinner, in my opinion, that was NOT prime ribs. Even with the steak knife, it was horribly tough...and it was well done. I hesitated to tell the waiter but I did. Not even an apology and off he went.  I'm not one to leave food on my plate....but the \"prime ribs\"...which, imo, was a skirt or a flank steak, was horrible....the vegetables were barely cooked (what is this? A Chinese restaurant???) and the mashed potatoes were questionable. If you looked at my plate, it looked as if I had a few bites. My friend was in agreement with me about her dinner as well.  Now onto our appetizers....my friend ordered shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were not cold as shrimp in a shrimp cocktail should be & her cocktail sauce was warm. My appetizer was mussels. Most were very small and dry and the broth lay at the bottom of the dish in less than an inch.  The waiter passed out table many times, glanced at our almost full plates & never said a word. We're pretty sure he knew exactly we weren't pleased with our dinner but never asked if \"anything is wrong\" or \"Can I get you dessert\" or \"do you want anything else\". Nothing. We left him a $2.00 tip.  Never again.  PS....the saving grace were the rolls. Warm & tasty...not the best.  Oh...and the butter was delicious!! Those were the butter pats served in little packages.  We'll never return !!!!",

My family and I have came into the location under the initial impression that credit cards were accepted, however the person at the front had let us know that it is a cash only place. (Though it still says credit card's  are accepted?)  With that minor set back, my family and I proceeded to go to an atm, gather money and head back to restaurant, since, we were all excited to try this place because of all the ratings.  When coming back to the establishment we were seated towards the kitchen, which is left, and straight ahead from entrance. As walking you will see a place where they hold performances onto the front right of the entrance and a bar to your left.  I had ordered Sauerbraten, a pretzel and beer. The pretzel and beer were ok, nothing spectacular. And the Sauerbraten, was just horrible. The meat was dry as a leather shoe, and the gravy didn't add moisture at all to the meat, which makes me think they weren't cooked together. My family's meals were just as bad as mine, however, this is about my experience. And my experience wasn't a good one. I had brought it to the attention to the staff, they didn't do the right thing and insisted that it's supposed to be like that...  Mmm nope.",

The first time it was great, felt fresh and done to perfection. However, my last visit wasn\u2019t too pleasing. I went back for the prime rib, expectations were height, but it was an absolute disaster. I ordered medium rare and got a cold and well-done piece of steak . They took it back, brought it to the kitchen, they cut it and got it back to my table. Yes, the very center may have been medium well, but the rest wasn\u2019t close to medium rare at all. I really don\u2019t like to argue at restaurants, so I paid the bill, walked away and don\u2019t plan to come back. I believe that they could have done a better customer service, but they chose not to. So, if you like a good prime rib, you may play your luck, but don\u2019t expect much.",

I am not a German food buff by any means, and can't speak to its authenticity, but I can say objectively that the food is delicious.  Packed with flavor and seasonings, the large portions hit the spot. Lots of unique beers on tap and prices are fair. Great service and the staff have been there a while. However, true to Bay Ridge, a live band started at 10pm sharp. So that prematurely ended my date as conversation became impossible. This was a Saturday night, so plan for that. That's just a personal gripe because my date was special. But in no way detracts from the outstanding experience of dining at Schnitzel Haus. I will definitely return and hopefully this wonderful woman will return with me.  Bring an appetite! Also the band sounded fantastic, one of the best I've heard in Bay Ridge.",

There is no soup or any kind of dessert and beverage is extra. Most of the dishes were only warm. We know it is difficult to keep food hot with only sterno. If you add a beer and dessert to buffet your at $25.00 for dinner. If your into buffets go to asian restaurant and have a feast for a lot less.",

Let's start with the food had a bowl of spicy goulash the beef in it was tough and just plain bad for a stew it should really soften that meat up but nope you'd be surprised, I ate about 5% of it. The saurbraten was inedible meat was horrible dry   flavorless despite the sweet and sour sauce with seemed watered down. I politely expressed to the server that I don\"t really like my dish and, would really like to send it back perhaps order something else in its place.   from what I assume she  goes to ask a \"manager\" . After a very akward silence and some choice whispering coming from the bar she returns and tells me nope there is nothing she can do. she says to my surprise \"I can't take it back I can't reserve it\" After a very troubling thought that they would evan try to reserve it. I look around and realize Evan if they did try to reserve it there would be no one to reserve it to. it was empty on a Saturday night with good reason. \"Manager\" \"owner\" made no effort to inquire about why I did not like the dish instead forced it on to the check with no alternative or accommodation, just a like it or not don't care. Gave two stars because I did have a wurst sampler as well and it was actually edible, and the beer selection was varied. I have been a culinary professional for nearly twenty years, and would like to offer a word of advice to this business, customers keep your doors open, unsatisfied ones keep them closed. please remind management and kitchen staff to have integrity in what they serve. I will not be returning to the haus and will detour all my friends and family alike.  as a sidenote it's 2016 accepting credit cards wouldn't be a bad thing either  of course it's your choice. Back to the food for dessert I had the German chocolate cake. In my best words it tasted like when you leave something way to long in the fridge and it takes the taste of the refrigerator, that about sums up the flavor on this one old and dried out. I really wanted to like this place  but they failed on so many levels, I have dedicated a tremendous amount of time and passion to the service industry and culinary arts that it's sad and disappointing when a restaurant puts shame to a country's food by serving sub par dishes with no willingness to try to resolve or engage its guests. Ohhhh I almost forgot bread was for sure old it was rubbery and stale  a warm up would of truly helped it out so much. In no way does this reflect our servers performance  she does what she  is told by management  and preforms her job to the best of her ability to which I thank her for",

One of them just played on her phone while my freind wanted to pay and when ask for something she rolled her eyes like we'd be a pain in the neck to her. Even though IF we would have been a pain she GOTTA BE friendly. Very disappointing. 2\u2606 only because the food was good.",

When asked why? he said we have Vendors to Pay on Monday\u2019s and Thursday\u2019s. I said what if I only have a credit card and no cash? He said there are banks in the area. I said this is not the point, maybe I do not have $180.00 in cash? He got really nasty and brought me to the front door to point out the sign that no one paid attention to; stated we do not accept credit cards on Sunday\u2019s and Wednesday\u2019s Their was another family there that also wanted to pay by credit card and did not understand this concept either. I personally think that those are their busiest days and are avoiding paying taxes on how much money they really make on those days (My Assumption). Therefore I will never step foot in there on a Sunday or Wednesday. I want to see how they will pay your vendor\u2019s if no one steps foot in tht place again on those days. You need to change this crazy rule. Who in this day, in this economy has $150.00 or more in their pockets for lunch?",
