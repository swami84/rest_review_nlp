If you are picking up, call in your order instead of using an app; they get charged by apps like GrubHub for pickup.  No indoor seating right now.  It looks like there are a couple tables outside, but I\u2019m not sure if they are for this restaurant.",

But on the the most important part, the FOOD.  Holy cow! The gyro was soooooo good. The bread was pillowy soft, the veggies fresh and crunchy, and the meat was plentiful, flavorful, and tender. One of the best gyros I have ever eaten.  I god a salad for more veggies because it is hard to get veggies when traveling. It was a large side salad with tomatoes, lettuce, purple cabbage, and cucumbers. A good size for the price.  The baclava was a little disappointing as it was dense but not bad. The locals eat here, the food is great and the gyro wrap is worth trying for sure!",

It\u2019s 4 minutes by car or 3 minutes by bike from the restaurant to the hotel I was at. I really like Indian Butter Chicken but not from this restaurant. The Butter Chicken from Sacrificial Lamb had no taste to it. It looked the right color, I don\u2019t know where the flavor was hiding. The texture was right for chicken but it was horribly bland. I ordered Garlic Naan and Kashmiri Naan, both room temperature and lacking taste. The real insult was the $2.95 Rass Malai. I thought it was a small cup with some type of condiments at first. It was a portion for a Hobbit with a gastric bypass, it was gone in two wanting bites. I wouldn\u2019t recommend eating at this restaurant.  This is probably my most negative review on Yelp.",

I called my order in at 8:38pm with someone who informed me that my single question about a side was unimportant because he was in a rush without answering my single question. Yet, I still placed an order for two entrees. After an hour and 45 minutes I called for an update/cancel of my order. I was told the delivery guy was 5 minutes away. 7 minutes later I called back to cancel my order and after a couple minutes on the phone the delivery guy showed up. I accepted the delivery. When I got inside it was lukewarm, if not colder than room temperature, and it had to be microwaved to be eaten. I live within a couple blocks of the restaurant. The food should not need microwaving, and should not take two hours to arrive. I enjoyed the decent food (I've had similar quality food from trader Joe's frozen foods without the ridiculous wait) but the overall experience was not worth the $30 it cost. I will never order from them again, and I will consider any other restaurant a better option than them. I want to make it clear because when I read some reviews of businesses, some seem to be outliers or almost obsessive reviews and indicative of a potentially unhinged reviewer. I am not a chronic reviewer nor a critical customer. Just treat me decent and give me decent product and service, and I will happily enjoy the decent experience. This interaction was so thoroughly negative, I felt the need to review the business. Please, do yourself a favor and enjoy food from elsewhere.",

Very glad I stopped in, portions were the right size, breads were baked after we ordered them in front of us and the food was excellent! It will definitely be on my list for inexpensive eats in the future!",
