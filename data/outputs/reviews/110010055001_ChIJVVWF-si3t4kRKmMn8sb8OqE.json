A few of us were treated to an evening get together and here are my thoughts afterwards:  1) Space: It's in a hotel, but they do a good job of making it feel like you're somewhere else. There's plenty of seating.  2) Drinks: They have a great cocktail list taking traditional cocktails and adding a spin to them. When they can, they use local brands.  3) Food: The chef is trained well and he makes really good food. I recommend the scallops. He uses few ingredients, but the taste is bold.  If you're looking for a fun happy hour spot after work, The Sally is a good option!",
