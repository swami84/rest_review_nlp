(Truth be told, we kind of assumed it mainly served tourists.)  But all we get these days is takeout and this evening we were craving Chinese food -- the sort we could find easily in Southern California, not the Asian-fusion dishes you get so often in DC (which to us are more like Thai and Vietnamese.)  After reading some positive reviews and finding out that it was indeed open (despite the fact that Woodley Park's two big hotels have been closed for months), we decided to give Eddie's Cafe a try.  We're SO glad we did and are just sorry it took us so long!  Each dish was prepared in a different style, with different sauces and flavors; the portions were large; and it tasted really good.  (Kung Pao Chicken, Eggplant with Ginger & Basil Sauce, and Pan Fried String Beans.)  And we've got soup saved for tomorrow to enjoy with the leftovers.  This is actually the best Chinese food we've found in this neighborhood, and we plan to become regulars.  Don't ignore what seem to be holes-in-the wall!",
