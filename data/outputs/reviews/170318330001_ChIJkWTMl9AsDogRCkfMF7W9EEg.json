The Brazilian fried chicken or frango a passarinho and it was phenomenal. It was unbreaded bone in fried chicken. It had a sweet yet smokey sauce on it and it was topped with cilantro and jalape\u00f1os which added to the whole flavor of the dish. As a side I got the Brazilian cheese bread which is in my opinion a better mozzarella stick because theres more cheese and it is less greasy. I would recommend to go here before it closes December 31st",

What was scorchingly hot and impossible to get into when it opened, has now become a lively, lovely neighborhood standby.  It is super comfortable and super tasty.  My wife, daughter, and I came for dinner on Sunday evening and the place was humming but not overrun.  Service was attentive and excellent and the pace of the meal was leisurely and relaxed, as it should be on a warm summer evening.  Just perfect.  Wine and cocktail service is outstanding, if not extensive.  My Caipirnha was terrific and not too sweet but with a good bite.  Too often this drink can be cloying if not handled well.  Dinner was excellent. Kale salad was creamy but with enough heat from the jalapeno to stand up to it.  Grilled Asparagus were tender and delicious. Empanadas were good but sort of boring. The whole fresh fish was absolutely delicious with an array of flavors that seemed more Asian than South American.  It was snapper on our evening but I'd order it regardless of the day's fish.  Pork Milenesa was good but a little dry and the hanger steak was expertly cooked and delicious.  This place has really matured and I love coming here for a more restrained, comfortable meal when I don't need to live on the edge with some hip newcomer.",

When the gelato for my apple pie empanada was forgotten (which was understandable given how busy the place was), they quickly brought it out, gave me an extra scoop and comped it. And oh man, the food, the food was great. You can tell a lot of thought went into the flavours and textures of the different dishes. The grilled pork chops may have been the best pork I've had - it was wonderfully moist and well flavoured. The cheese bread was another highlight. Overall, I highly recommend this place.",

My friend and I came at 3:00 and ordered off the brunch menu: the feijoada burrito (black beans and rive with lingui\u00e7a, scrambled eggs and  avocado in a grilled tortilla), the p\u00e3o de queijo (small tapioca buns made with oil and cheese\u2014surprisingly light and very delicious). We also ordered their tepache (pineapple juice infused with ginger and spices). Everything was great. I have very high standards for my food and am actually disappointed by most of the restaurants I've been to in Chicago (I'm from the central coast of California), but this place nailed it with respect to full-bodied flavors, a rich assortment of textures, and satisfying serving sizes. We stayed chatting for two an a half hours, by which time the sun had set and it looked like much of the staff was changing over. I was deeply impressed that the servers kept coming to refill our water glasses even half an hour after we had paid our checks. This place should be more crowded at 4:00 pm on a Saturday! (It started filling up very quickly after 5:00, so you might want to make a reservation.)",

Everyone gave us excelent service, however Lily was amazing in particular. Gave us excelent suggestions regarding our food and made sure to make the night special as we were celebrating our anniversary.  I never thought I would enjoy a vegetarian empanada as much as I did at la sirena. Wish I would have gotten 5 more.  The ribeye with frites was cooked to perfection. My dish, the roasted duck was simply amazing. Flavors perfectly balanced and the dish was  portioned well.  Thank you to everyone at La Sirena for helping me make the night special!",

I love restaurants that  offer up dishes that wow you and provide flavor combos you haven't had before.  Their dishes are spicy, not in a hot way, but in a cool flavor way.  Fulton Market is exploding  as a must visit area for great food.  La Sirena is a leader in this pack.  Hit it!",

That's what happened to my group and I at La Sirena yesterday. My 3 friends and I decided to gather there for drinks and food. Understanding there were no reservations available, we opted for seating at the bar which was confirmed as first come, first served. Well, after almost 20 - 30 min of sitting at the bar chatting and preparing to order drinks and food, the hostess came by and asked us to give up our bar seats for a pair who arrived late for their reservation and thus had their table given to other guests. The hostess somehow decided that our group of 4 needed to give up 2 of our \"first come, first served\" seats for 2 guests who were late. Riddle me that?  Pretty upset my the experience, we decided to leave and try Wow Fun, where we walked in and received wonderful service and great food. It's worth noting that when we left La Sirena, I attempted to close out my single drink tab and the bartender whispered, \"Don't worry, I'll cover the drink. I'm not sure what's happening but I'm sorry.\" At least there are SOME good staff left at La Sirena.",

Everything is tapas-style here and we ordered 6 dishes for 3 people. The P\u00e3o de Qeijo was really good, if I wasn't so full, I would have eaten more. Next we had the Ceviche which was pretty decent for me. The Fried Cauliflower was probably my favorite dish of the night. The Whole Fried Fish was pretty large and was cooked extremely well! Finally, we had the Iron Roasted Hanger Steak cooked to perfection :) It's a little pricey, but I think really worth it!",

The food looks reasonably priced for a lunch, $12 for salad or bowl, but it is $2 more for avocado, $6 for a chicken breast or shrimp and double the price ($12) for beef.  I had a shrimp bowl that had slow cooked black beans, jasmine rice, chimichurri and 4 or 5 shrimp.  Everything tasted fine, but nothing special.  Beans, rice a little protein at that price seems like a bad deal.",

I ordered the \"The Crying Game\", a potent and manly cocktail from their Bebidas menu. It was served on the rocks and made with overproof rum, 2 other kinds of rum and bitters - with no true \"mixer\" it's strong. Perfection.  Once seated, we started with pan de queijo (cheese bread) - don't think of typical American cheesy bread from Dominos. It's more like a warm pillow of baked dough filled with a soft gooey cheese. Next, we ordered the garlic frites - crispy fries topped with a generous amount of herbs and salt and served with some bomb aoili! We also ordered the coxinha, a smoked chicken croquette - it was pretty good, but not a standout. We weren't too hungry so we didn't get entrees, but we did get DESSERT! The panna cotta was so damn good! Such a complex dish and variety of flavors packed into one amazing dish.  We loved the atmosphere here - the bartender that served us our drinks and our server were both amazing and attentive. The restaurant was dimly lit and quiet. It's a perfect date night spot - check it out.",

Good beer selection as well. Friendly wait staff as well! I've been in a few times since for lunch. Cool to sit up at the bar & have a kick ass lunch break!",

The octopus salad had great acidity, and the octopus was perfectly tender. The sweetbreads were massive and creamy, and the giardiniera added a nice sweet heat. The thin cut short rib was a refreshing change from any I've had before. The brussel sprouts were a pleasant surprise and had almonds for days.  Had a couple cocktails, though I can't remember their names, were both good accompaniments to a well rounded experience. Will definitely be back soon.",

This is Chicago, a foodie paradise, so this place just doesn't cut it. There wasn't a single dish that made me say I need to try this again. We had six in our group and we shared, so I was able to try several items on the menu. Service was slow and staff just lacked interest. Also everyone in our table said we smelled urine as we walked into the restaurant. It maybe due to the close proximity of the bathroom to the restaurant. My point is that there are several other restaurants in Chicago that is truly worth your money.",
