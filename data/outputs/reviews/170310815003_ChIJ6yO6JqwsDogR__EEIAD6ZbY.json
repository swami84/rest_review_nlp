Located across from The Paul Revere House on North Street in Boston's historic North End. The menu includes traditional red sauce dishes, home made pastas and seafood and grilled red meat. Something for everyone and a nice variety of wine and cordials to compliment the meal.",

All came out super fast and on-top of each other which wasn't great. My Shiraz tasted as if it had been there a couple of days and was only offered more at the end of our meal. The place got really busy quick so we are not sure if they were just trying to turn the tables over. Our food was ok at best bruschetta was drowning in balsamic vinegar and pasta dishes lacked flavour and hard shell clams were bitter. I would like to chalk it up to they were busy since they were. But there are so many other Italian restaurants in the area I will try a different one next time.",

From our seating thru dinner our service was friendly and prompt.  The menu included traditional Italian dishes, several with the Chef\u2019s own twist.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her gnocchi  and I also loved the Chicken Parm with pasta.  The red sauce was as good as any I\u2019ve had in Italy.  The wine list was more than adequate and desserts were also well done.  We were able to meet the owner and the son who is the Chef.  Both were extremely friendly and interested in our thoughts of the food and the restaurant.  We would highly recommend Riccardo\u2019s.  Four stars from us!",

We asked to receive split checks before the food actually came out (although after we placed the orders), and waitress wouldn't do it, even though the place wasn't busy.  Staff subtly tries to rush us when it takes us a quite a while to figure out the bill.  That's what happens when you don't split the check guys.  Less than 5 minutes from your waitress would've saved 20+ minutes of us figuring out the bill.  This bill payment also would've been less difficult if they had not charged us for bottled water at over $4.00 per 12 oz bottle, that was left on the table at the start, and similar dirty charging for sparkling water.  We didn't ask for it, and if it's there at the start, I'd assume it to be complimentary.  Sleazy.  Food was mediocre as well.  Meatball appetizer was obviously microwaved, with still cold center.",

Well needless to say this place uses store bought pasta and my Irish ex-girlfriend makes better gravy! To top things off there was some guy barking orders while sitting at the bar boozing! That is not the ambiance you want when you take your lady out in the north end! I hope this helps people decide whether to go to this place in the future.",

Other tables were getting up and leaving due to same issues. Wait staff checked on us once or twice during this time. We got a small bread basket for our group of 6, one tiny piece of bread each during this time, when we asked for more bread we were told they were out of bread. 5 minutes later,  another server takes a larger basket of bread to another table. We ask her for more bread and then get it. When the food did come it just was not good. Nobody in our party was happy with their food. I had pork, and it was very dry and tough. There generally seemed to be a bit of an attitude from the staff with their customers. I think maybe if the restaurant focused on the execution of the food and service, delivering a quality product and experience they would have happier customers and be able to lose the attitude.",

We walked across the street to Riccardo's and were immediately given a table in the center of the restaurant with a great view of the busy street activities. The restaurant was charming and full of life. The food was some of the best Italian I have ever eaten. My Caesar Salad and Lasagna was to die for! Everyone at our table loved the food. We spoke in length with the owner of the restaurant and were impressed with his concern that we had a great dining experience. I will make an effort to seek out Riccardo's again on any return to Boston. I dream of his lasagna! Viva Riccardo's!",
