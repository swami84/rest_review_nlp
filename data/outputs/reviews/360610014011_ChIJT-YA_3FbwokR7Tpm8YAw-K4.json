        "caption": "Very tasty food. Got take out but as of 07/11/20 they look like they are constructing some seats to take advantage of the sidewalk dining initiative in NYC. We got everything \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201cregular\u201d spicy - I think this would suffice for people who are wary of excessive heat, but if you enjoy hotpot you might want to ask them to dial it up.  Chicken Skeleton: I feel this dish will be hit/miss: if you like gnawing on chicken necks, eating cartilage and gristle etc, then you\u2019ll probably enjoy it. We got two chicken carcasses in our order.  Sichuan chilled noodles: extremely refreshing summer dish, the chunks of cucumber add perfect crispness.  Dan Dan Noodles: would benefit from a higher spice level, however the sauce is rich and the crushed peanuts complement the flavor very well.  Lotus root: a personal favorite, the sauce is extremely tasty. Crunchy and delicious.  Sichuan fries: the \u201cfries\u201d mostly refers to the crinkle cut style of the potatoes, they weren\u2019t crispy but the seasoning was good.  Tofu Skin salad: I don\u2019t know the proper name for this type of tofu but I wish I did. Great mouth feel - firm without being overly chewy, plus it has that dimpled texture. Almost like another noodle dish in a menu with some great noodle options.",
