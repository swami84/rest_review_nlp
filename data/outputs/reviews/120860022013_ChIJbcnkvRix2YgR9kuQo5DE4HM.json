The bacon flavor was well defined, but shone more like a hint of beef jerky. The chashu pork cut was nice, thick, and super tender and the soaked up the flavor of the broth. The noodles had a gentle texture with a light spring to it (excellent). The nitamago was seasoned so well that the bonito undertones were front and center and let's not forget the texture of the yolk was nice and runny without dissolving into the broth! This was some great ramen!",

There was exceptional attention to detail given to everything we received, even the rice was specially seasoned.  The sandos, especially the pork, combined several flavors and textures. The katsu for both the sando and curry was deliciously crispy. For the curry, even the rice was flavored, there are lots of different flavors to enjoy in each bite of the dish between the curry, pork katsu, veggies, and even some pickled topping.  The service was awesome and the prices are a little higher than you may pay elsewhere, but it\u2019s to be expected for the area. You\u2019re smack in the middle of fancy shops left and right, so don\u2019t expect rock bottom prices for your food. The creativity and flavors make the price well worth it. Can\u2019t wait to try more of the menu!",

I did not expect a traditional shoyu broth or for the depth of flavor to be at the level that I've had in Japan, but this ramen was disappointing overall. The broth was unbalanced and far too sweet, a bit oily, and without layered depth of flavors. The mushroom flavors that came through were nice. The best part of the dish was the duck breast, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The portion size was on the smaller side with few noodles. For a ramen that costs over $20, it certainly did not meet expectations. Ramen is all about the broth and this broth wasn't very good. Service was very friendly and helpful. The food stall was very clean. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend Yuzu for ramen.",
