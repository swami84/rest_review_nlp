If you're looking for a great coffee shop to chill at in East Harlem, El Barrista won't let you down! They've got a great menu of pastries and cooked food, top quality coffee, and super comfortable interiors. The large flat screen TVs are a bonus if you want to catch a football (European or American) or basketball game. Shout-out to the new owner, Emmanuel, who's manning the counter and providing excellent customer service along with his staff. Ignore the bad old reviews, this now under new management although they kept the name of the old establishment.",

If you look in the market area the supernice coffee have a better variation of coffee beans and pastries. My suggestion is to make your own homemade pastries or get it as much fresh as possible with multiple options because very often times I can't get croissants or cinnamon buns so I have to take a longer walks to get it somewhere else. Also I would like if you guys could be more into coffe. Coffe its a big world and if you guys have more coffe beans and styles to make it. You all would make the difference to the others.

Not sure what he wanted us to say after that but I then said we arent looking for anything in return but to let you know theres a roach on the cup and possibly on the counter. And again we were given alot of atitude and it seemed like he had no intrest in trying to handle the situation this was verry upsetting and i will no longer recomend this shop to any of my coworkers or friends",
