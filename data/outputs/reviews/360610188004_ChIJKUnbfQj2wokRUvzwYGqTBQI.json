We asked about the happy hours and they said they didn't have one. We were already seated so we gave it the benefit of a doubt and stayed. We order white sangria for starts, we were disappointed immediately by the presentation due to the fact it had a mint in and a slice of orange. We looked over the menu, everything was very different for this Mexican infusion ?  but we still picked the most appealing to us. We asked about the specials and whatever she read off her personal handbook sounded like one long gibberish of just one special. We ordered La Gringa and Harlem Style in laymans terms tasteless shrimp, chorizo, pineapple, cheese something. Then when it came to our second round my friend got a whiskey n I wanted a margarita, I asked what other flavors and the waitress sounded unsure proceeded to read off the drunk menu (tamarindo, hibiscus flowers, herbs, rose petals, jalapeno, chilly peppers) to us still sounding unsure. For a place that isn't that big they're attentiveness wasn't so great either. Finally got my margarita, and didn't get salt on the rim like a asked for. Right when we asked for the check they offered postre, my friend decided why not and got the arroz con leche. The look of confusion came over us by this what look like a small cup molding with sprinkles and green paste, my friend tasted it and was even more disappointed by the lack of taste, still don't know why it had sprinkles and once again an unnecessary mint paste at the bottom. When we finally got the bill we were appalled by how extremely expensive it was for tasteless, unsatisfying, unfilling, other than okay plate presentation it definitely wasn't worth the cost. I will never come back nor will I recommend this place to any one else.  I don't normally do reviews but this place definitely called for a bad review!",

While the spot is tiny, there's tons of cultural charm lining the walls and there's an outdoor space in the back, although it wasn't open when I went.  This is a tapas spot, so don't look to be full after ordering an \"entree\" but be prepared for magic in your mouth. I tried to alter an item on the menu, to which I was promptly told no because it would change the flavor, and I'm so happy I trusted the receipe design of each plate. I had the guacamole and chips for an appetizer, and the Chabela for my entree and every item I tasted was clearly made with love. Everything was so well seasoned!  If I wasn't a believer in \"good things take time,\" I might have been a little annoyed at how long my food took to get to the table. But the food was so good though that it was worth the wait. If you are in a rush, this is not your place. But if you are looking for a meal your palate will undoubtedly enjoy, you'll find it here.",

I asked if we can sit anywhere and he told me to wait that he would have to set it up and I replied to him not to trouble himself so much we can sit anywhere and he replied in Spanish \u201coh no I have my own style\u201d, whatever that meant. He was more concerned about what the place looked like than actual customers that\u2019s walked in. Which is understandable the place was impeccable I guess. He seemed to be the only one serving and decided to take pictures of a dish and of himself \u201ceating and drinking\u201d on a table(I\u2019m assuming for advertising reasons) while customers were waiting for their orders. Before that he moved the customer that was sitting on that exact table across the room after  the customer was already sitting there. Their signature sangria was watered down not worth $9 and the beer was warm borderline hot. Although the guacamole and flatbreads were good, there was no authenticity of cultures taste. Unfortunately I  wouldn\u2019t go back. :(",

The New Yorker was not lying when they wrote an article about it in May, their guac is priceless and the drinks were well made. So I picked the place with a group of people for some birthday drinks a couple of weeks later and I got very disappointed. The waiter was incredible rude. For an upscale Mexican street food place/bar I expected more than a waiter that offended different people in our group. They also tried to charge us food that never came and my Margarita was not on the rocks but on an iceberg. I don't know what went wrong but I would not go there with a group of people again. The place has a lot of potential but service needs to be improved.",

He is fearless and boldly puts out beutiful, well known ingredients in addition to the tasty and unique on the plate.  There is something for everyone on the menu; something for the traditionalist and something for the advenurer.  The prices are beyond resonable for the quality.  The plates are small and meant to be shared; guests get to expereince a taste of many flovors and textures.  In my mind, this is a destination place for those who live in another neighborhood.
