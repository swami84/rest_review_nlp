That's kind of the beauty of these places, where you essentially design your own dish, if they provide good ingredients. All of the proteins and veggies and toppings and everything was fresh and you select what you want, so if you don't like your dish, it's likely your own fault. :)  I had tried 2 tunas and scallops in my 3protein bowl. Scallops were not as tender, but they're cooked and then chilled... the tuna melts in your mouth and everything was so fresh!  It was only 2 people working there (seemed like the owners), so it takes a minute, but SO WORTH IT!!",

I\u2019ve tasted many poke bowls in DC and Arlington area, but i didn\u2019t know these toppings can be this crunchy! Well done! Moreover, their marinated raw fish doesn\u2019t have an overpowering sauce (which is usually the case with marinated ones). So when you add some sauces of your choice at the end, it doesn\u2019t end up being too salty! So I could taste the raw fish marinated at just right level! Last but not least, the place has a nice, cozy and CLEAN setting, too. After the COVID-19, i would like to sit there and enjoy a poke bowl! Thanks guys! I will go back soon!",

        "caption": "I really hope this place strives. This is the only poke place near Montgomery village. Then, there's one in rio. They offer 2$ off 15 I decided not to do that on my current visit. While I was eating and I asked them if they had a tip jar.  They said no. I said really? They looked at each other like they didn't know what tip jar is. I asked them for a change of 5$ I tipped them. They said thank you. I said no problem. They are essential workers as well. I have to tip them. They offered if  I wanted a cup of water. I said sure. It was spicy lol. I gave them 4 stars because  1 staff were only wearing 1 glove not both and the other wasn't wearing any. They were friendly though. The food is fresh. I like their marinated salmon and tuna. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the black peppered tuna, but hey maybe your tastes buds might be different than mines",

What we just ate was great (both in quality and quantity) and we really hope they can keep up the good work!  The order we made on their website went through perfectly and they were ready at the requested time. It looked like the amount of food turnover was good so everything stayed fresh!",
