I asked it may be until 9:30.. We passed by 10 o'clock.. Waited for a long time. We will sit down at 10:40.. Because we want to eat fast and not affect others at about the end of work time. The soup will come out at about 10:55.. The Qitai that serves us tonight also knows.. We will I didn\u2019t boil it when I ate it. Some were eaten before it boiled. We also knew it was too late. I can eat it quickly! In fact, you can choose not to pick up the shop when the time is up. There is an odd table to see if we haven\u2019t boiled. Just come and help us take it in and burn it. It hasn\u2019t been taken out for a few minutes. Another odd table came over and said sorry to me We are closed here, and we will give you another 5 minutes. Since you chose to take the order so late, you shouldn\u2019t be like that. It was 11.50 minutes at that time. In fact, we knew it was late and talked to another strange station. Say. Sorry! We also work in the service industry.. My wife also specifically said that we try to finish eating as soon as possible. . Hearing what this Qitai said, I couldn't eat it when I was so angry!

You ask someone to rush Eat to die? I really want to scold people. But your attitude. You speak your voice.! Or don\u2019t pick it up if it\u2019s too late. Wouldn\u2019t it be too much to drive others away after you pick it up? And it\u2019s windy outside. It doesn\u2019t boil all the time. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to eat fast.

Even if the food is expensive, the service is not good, the water is not added, the plates are not changed, and I have to do it myself. However, the result was canceled. The spoon dropped into the pot and it was urged twice before I changed it. A bunch of waiters walking around didn't add anything to you. Shouldn't the expensive items keep up with the service?

Service and environment are also good. The biggest problem may be that there are too many people and replenishment is too slow. Every time I have to wait for the place where the ingredients are taken, some things are robbed and empty. The seasoning area was also not added in time. When I was seasoning, the garlic and parsley were empty. I hope that this aspect can be strengthened, even if the price is increased a little, but it can greatly enhance the customer's dining experience.

Pros: Valet parking, no need to worry about the parking. Just park in front of the restaurant and someone will help you. No long waiting. If you remember, the Flushing location is always crowded especially during the weekend. This location is just about right. Not crowded but the food, service and flavor are the same great!!

The staff is very receptive to any questions and are very helpful when we needed anything. The only minor problems were the prices are pretty high but the food is very good. And the drinks that some of the people ordered took a while to come out. However I recommend people try this place out.",

The service was fantastic and attentive waiters and servers, they wore nice uniforms too. It was difficult choosing which soup base to go with but opted for the split broth with the Teddy Bear base. The food was high quality from all the dishes we ordered, although a bit pricier than most places but it's higher end overall. The menu is pretty extensive including bubble tea. I enjoyed all the delicious ingredients i ordered like the Black Tofu, which was a charcoal flavor, spicy marinated beef, a nice fatty thinly sliced beef, tripe and shrimp paste wrapped with mushroom.",

Came here with one other friend for dinner, bill came out to 200+ for almost the same amount of food we usually order at all you can eat hotpot. But to be fair we also ordered wagyu beef that was on the menu, think it's about $27 per plate but there were only like 5 or 6 thin slices per plate. Don't be fooled btw. Many of their meat dishes here come on a basket where theres ice on the bottom with the meat on top, to keep the meat fresh I guess. It gives a delusion that you are getting a lot of meat but you are really only getting several slices per dish. They do have a lot of variety here if you are looking for something more than your typical all you can eat hotpot. Besides the food, the interior is very nice. It looks like one of those restaurants that you find in the ancient times of China. Their waiter/waitress are also dressed up. When we went there was some sort of performance going on near the entrance of the restaurant where you can watch while you eat. Not sure if they always had performances or it was a special occasion. Overall food was okay but too pricey and the interior design is very nice.",
