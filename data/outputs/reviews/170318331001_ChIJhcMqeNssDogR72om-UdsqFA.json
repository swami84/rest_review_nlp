One week we never got pizza, after 3 calls and 2 apologies, promises to re-deliver, over two hours later. Sad, since this is the best location near the Loop.  ...call ahead, after ordering, to make sure it's made, and go pick it up yourself... it should be ok. But its a grab bag. Other locations are better. Yes, inconsistency can result from high turnover, lack of good employees; this store fails too often, to be explained by metrics.  Do use them if you love Dominos: but plan to supervise your order process, pick it up yourself, and have a solid meal backup plan!...",

I commented that it was a long wait and he said yes it was. The pizza was cold and soggy. It also was crushed because all the other deliveries sat on top of it.

He was short and rude with me, so I said okay fine i'll go. I get to the top of the elevators because I had a ton of luggage with me, and would be unable to carry the pizza with everything else I had. I waited for ten minutes after the rude manager told me he was about to be there. So I called back and asked where he was, and he was SO UNBELIEVABLY rude and told me he didn't know and that I had to go down the elevators to meet him. I told him absolutely not, that I AM PAYING CUSTOMER WHO ORDERED \"DELIVERY\" for a reason!!! He was so mean and nasty to me that I felt violated. I cannot believe this place is in business. Oh yeah, he also wouldn't give me his name. The pizza was also cold and not good!! BEWARE of this place & the people!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!",

There was a policy change about their delivery, but If you order online nowhere does it indicate in bold on their website that they will not deliver it to the apartment! Who would think to go on their policy tab to first check if they deliver it to your apartment when I never ever have to do this with any other restaurants or food delivery services.

Got the notification that the pizza(1 pan, 14 wings, and bites were ready) Waited for 30 mins past when the pizza was ready just for them to tell me that my order was cancelled( I had no notification of that happening). After 35 mins after, my pizza was ready she said she made the pizza and put it in the oven and said it would be 7 minutes. At that point, I left...I cannot trust a word they say when I was told 30 min past the completion time 1) it's in the oven 2) The order is cancelled - so it was never made 3) she just put it in it will be 7mins. I cannot trust being lied to from so many sources.  DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING THEY SAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WHATS  GOING ON!!!",

So we were on a tight schedule, after waiting about a hour we called to see when it would be here as the app said it was on its way a hour ago, they said it was almost there and over a hour later it still isn't here, by the time the pizza got to the hotel it was Luke warm and they didn't even cut the pizza, have you ever tried to cut a pizza and it looks cut but they bottom of the pizza was barely touched? Well thats what it was! They had over 2 hours to make the pizza and they couldn't even cut it, let alone keep it hot.  So after we had to cut the pizza with plastic silverware, we were 45 minutes late to our polar express ride and had to schedule it for another day, very disappointed and should've gotten a refund, would've rather at at Mcdonalds or the train station.",

If I\u2019d known, I would have walked there to get it myself in less time. After another 45 minutes my pizza finally arrived but yet again was undercooked to the extent that I had to preheat the oven and put the pizza back in just to cook the raw dough the rest of the way through. I ordered the pizza shortly before 10, it is now almost midnight. I could have made dough from scratch, prepared the pizza, cooked it (fully) and eaten it in the same amount of time.

Ordered a pizza online and the tracker said it would take about 68 to 78 minutes. Fine, seems a bit on the longer side, but weathers been bad all day so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. After an hour and a half passed I called them to see the status of the pizza because the online tracker just kept flashing \"Prep\". Lady on the phone said they had been experiencing longer times because of the weather and said it would be another hour and a half. Waited another hour and a half and the tracker still said \"Prep\" so I called them. Guy who answered was unbelievably rude and wouldn't answer my questions as to why it was taking so long and why I should expect to wait another hour. That's when I asked for their corporate number and the guy just told me to \"dial 1-800-DOMINOS\" -_-. So when i asked him for the actual number, he kept repeating himself until he finally gave me some bunk ass number. I hung up the phone and saw on the tracker that it had been moved to \"Bake\". That's when I decided to call them again and cancel my order and ask for a refund. Unfortunately this wasn't my first bad experience with this location, the first being not as bad, but just inconvenient. Fortunately, this will be my last experience with them though. Word to the wise, do not order a pizza from here, it's definitely not worth the stress of having to experience the abominable customer service.",

We live in the city but do not have a car. My husband takes a cab over to pick up the order, and they inform him the foods not ready. He left without food, and I had to call to speak to management about how unacceptable that is. They denied telling us that our order was ever ready, or that we should come pick it up. The app has a short fall, where you cannot change the location from which you order, and corporate does not take complaints. You have to complain directly to the store. The manager there is the most unprofessional person I have ever spoken with. This place is horrible and run by people who couldn't care less.",

The delivery guy was standing there visibly annoyed. I paid and gave a tip.  Then I kindly asked if my ranch was inside the box. He said \"I don't know. Maybe\" and proceed to leave. I was stunned then I asked if I could get my money back for the ranch.  I know it's 75 cents. I would have brushed it off if the guy was nice and apologized. But because he was rude I got mad and I called to get my refund. The guy on the phone was RUDE!  Everyone is rude. The pizza was old and cold. It was horrible.",
