You can tell a lot of the clientele comes from that new, fancy apartment complex right across the street, sitting there in their \"thrift store\" clothes writing poetry and whatnot, but that isn't this place's fault. Personally, I find the espresso/lattes aren't quite as good as trans am right down the street, but there is more seating here, so that's a plus.",

This neighborhood is in the midst of change. I'm visiting my daughter (3 years since last time) and am surprised by the new construction, restaurants, and, of course, breweries. I assume many locals don't like this, but change is inevitable and often advantageous (e.g., new jobs). I lived in Oakland 20 years and witnessed blight become bright.
