While I understand seating is limited as it is and it was valentines day, I was seated in an area that seemed makeshift. Very well lit as opposed to other dimly lit areas and near a secondary back bar that was empty. It is a restaurant with a great view & I was disappointed to have no view of the outside or any decor at all for that matter. However, as mentioned I understand the circumstances and appreciate the great waiter and food!",

Yes there was a long wait even with a reservation, however it was obvious to why. The views are incredible so people don\u2019t want to leave quickly and are soaking it all in. I\u2019ve noticed that some tables were there for over 2 hours. A lot of them didn\u2019t even leave for a while after paying. I can\u2019t blame them.  We ordered King Salmon and Red Snapper. Salmon was made to perfection. Red Snapper was amazing as well, but keep in mind... Red snapper alone can feed 2 people easily. We ended up taking most of it out.  Drinks were strong but not to the point of being too much. One thing for sure, bartenders at this place do not cheap out on making drinks.",

Going in today was very disappointing and Upsetting. I feel embarrassed that the guest I had with me witnessed the poor behavior Vito had while talking to me.

        "caption": "My sisters & I took our parents here for their 25th wedding anniversary. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I ordered a martini & first asked if they had blue cheese olives, the waiter said yes & then ended up bringing it to me with plain olives & said sorry I thought we had them but we don't! I was shocked that not only a high end restaurant like this didn't have blue cheese olives but that the waiter thought it ok to bring me plain olives then to come over & ask me first if that was alright. I really only wanted a martini with the blue cheese or else I would've got a different drink! I think when you're paying 16.00 for a drink it should come how it was ordered! For dinner I ordered a filet & salad. I ordered the filet medium well, it was definitely medium RARE. A medium well steak has only a hint of pink in the middle this steak was VERY PINK all the way through. I was so hungry I ate it & all night I felt so sick. I would've loved to ask kindly if I could get it cooked more but I never saw our waiter again after we got our food!!!! No one ever came by to ask how everything was! Even at the cheapest restaurants they always come to ask how everything is. I was in complete shock. I'm sorry but 40.00 for a steak, that is fine but I expect it to be cooked how I asked for it. We had a party of 11 so I didn't know until the ride home that there were 3 others in our group who had under cooked steak! My poor little niece said she thought her steak mooed at her! She took it home for mom to cook it more there. My husband liked his steak as he likes it practically raw. The salad was awful, how do you mess up a salad right?? Well they use huge pieces of romaine lettuce (the kind we use at home for sandwiches!!) It was too much of a pain to cut it, took forever. Bottom line I had nothing at all that I was happy with & I am not a picky person at all! Come to find out my Dad was one who's steak was under cooked & my brother in law told me my mom ordered bolognese with prime rib & I guess the way it was worded she was looking all over through the pasta for prime rib not realizing it was in the sauce! I felt terrible this is how their 25th wedding anniversary dinner from us turned out. I just knew we should've went to Ruth's Chris where the prices are basically the same if not cheaper & the service is always phenomenal. My sister ordered the salmon & said it was just \"okay\" she also is far from picky. When you are coming to a high end place like this you expect more than mediocre food & poor service! Also when we were almost done with dinner I really needed more water, I felt so dehydrated. When a woman came by to clear some plates from our table (not our waiter) I asked her if I could please have some more water. She didn't respond but I asked plenty loudly & she was right by me. So then my husband nicely asked her & she never got me any!!! Then my niece offered me hers as she never drank any. Our bill including the 20% tip we left (we all work or have worked in the customer service industry) we spent just under 1,000.00!! I definitely feel robbed. I would say the only thing enjoyable about this place is the gorgeous scenery outside & inside. There are far better places in the city that have fantastic customer service & gorgeous views. I see zero reason to ever visit Terrace 16 again. Super disappointing!",

Price rating is accurate - things are a bit pricey here but I'd imagine that's to pay for the rent.  Staff were curt, but I'd imagine it's because they get a handful of Trump haters and broke folks from time to time who end up as problematic guests. There was certainly a sharpness to their attitude, nevertheless I wouldn't qualify it as full-out rudeness even if we certainly looked the part.  Prices are about $10-25 for glasses. $4 dollars-42.50 for food. The seasonal ice cream turned out to be alcoholic sorbet (negroni-based). I am a non-drinker, so after bringing this to the wait-staff's attention, the server gave me a sincere apology, and brought a vanilla custard instead.  The quality of the food and beverage is good, but the real value is in the view you pay for. We were able to stay for as long as we wanted and weren't pressured to leave even as many others joined in the evening rush, so that's a huge plus.  Much of what Terrace 16 gets right is the experience of a rooftop lounge. If they improve in their waitstaff's service, they can truly bring the five-star lounge to the five-star Trump Hotel.",

The one drink we ordered, which they \"had available\" was not brought to us. Instead they took the liberty of bringing us a completely different drink.  They also didn't have food items available. We ended up ordering a lobster roll which was $36 for a bun that was 95% filled with veggies and 5% with a measley substance that was supposed to pass off for lobster.  Two of us ordered a Plate of Octopus, which turned into a scavenger hunt of finding an actual octopus piece on the plate, among the 95% of veggies. A more accurate description would have been - a plate of lettuce and Cabbage in a gravy of sauce , with a garnish of octopus. Zero flavor.  Last and absolutely worst - service! Incredibly slow. I. E. They brought out our appetizer at the END of our meal. With no apology or acknowledgment of their mistake. My meal was brought about ten minutes after everyone else's. Again, no attempt made to appease the customer. The terrace was unbelievably cold and they told us we couldn't sit in an area near the gas lamps because that area wasn't served.  All in all. Extremely overpriced, with awful service and cheap substitutes for what a meal at the price listed should be. Avoid.",
