It should not take longer than ordering at a sit down restaurant. I ordered the Cheezy Soy milk tea and Cheezy Sesame and both good. I especially like the Cheezy Soy, it's very unique. I would love to come back and try other drinks and food on their menu. Sadly, I do not think I'll return any time soon. They need to do better processing orders, whether, it is hiring more staff or halt accepting new orders until they can complete current orders. They were taking in way more orders via phone and online than they can process. Also, if the wait time is beyond the norm, the staff should inform customers of the expected wait time before processing orders.",

Service was like any other service (they take your order and then make it, no need for extras) and drinks were really good. The strawberry swirl and the ice honey oolong tea with cheese foam was really good. The popcorn chicken taste like any other popcorn chicken but I appreciate the drinks being 20oz cups and we were only charged around 5 dollars instead of the 7 dollars that other people have said it to be. The drinks and the food took long but I wasn't in a hurry and I dont think they deserve a low rating because the drinks were really high quality and it takes a lot of work to chop strawberries and put it in a drink with tons of boba. Other bubble tea places dont usually put REAL strawberries in your strawberry drinks but this place does. I think this place deserves over a 4 star.",

As fancy as the cup is, when I stuck my straw in there it didn\u2019t pull anything so when I pulled my straw out ...half the bubble tea fell on me. I got the diamond brown sugar milk tea and although it has \u201cboba\u201d in it doesn\u2019t count for having a topping so to get the golden mini boba as part of their deal you need to have 1 topping and for me that meant order one additional topping on top of the boba. Cmon guys, that\u2019s absurd especially when I\u2019m paying $5.75 cash for my purchase. It\u2019s a pretty cup but definitely would look to other places in the neighborhood.",

The staff were very polite and the service was really fast, you\u2019d need to wait like at most a few minutes. For like around $4 or $5, it\u2019s definitely worth the quality of the drinks.

The workers understood orders and the food usually took around 5-15 minutes. Many milk tea are under $5 , reason why I didn\u2019t give it a 5 star is because mainly the lack of space the store has but the place is fun and great for dates",

The cup quality was surprisingly good, and the cups were quite tall. The matcha flavor was a bit lacking though, but the red bean was chewy and good. The menu was quite interesting and had some rare items on the menu (like aiyu drink and taro balls as a topping). I tried a bit of my friend's taro milk tea, but it was really strange and milky, not a fan. At $4.75 (including tax), it was a good amount of bubble tea, but the quality wasn't there. This is a to-go place as there's not really a shop attached to it either.",
