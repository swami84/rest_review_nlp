However, be prepared. They only take cash and they don\u2019t take funny business. Parties over 6 need to call ahead. Bad Yelp reviews are proudly displayed over the toilets. Requests for substitutions are made at your own risk. The Pudding is busy enough to choose their customers.  But the gruffness is part of the charm. This is a restaurant to return to, week after week. Always surprising and delicious. The food is of and part of the neighborhood. Settle in and enjoy. And if you don\u2019t, we won\u2019t miss ya.",

It is a very popular place so either arrive early 5-6:00 PM or be prepared to wait. Everything I have eaten here has been very tasty. There is a good wine list but the house red wine is fine and very inexpensive at $5 a glass or $15 for a bottle. They make their own pasta. Whole wheat or gluten free pasta can be ordered for a small extra charge. The only negative is that it tends to get noisy.",

Its chaotic order among the staff; we were without menus for 10 minutes because there were none for us to review.  The whole Orata was done really well, but the pastas were over seasoned to the point where I was bloated until my ring was too tight to wear.  We waited an hour for our table, which seems normal. In truth, there is way better Italian food for what you pay and wait for, even though the menu is mainly centered food from Naples.  It's 2-stars because it's not worth the money, effort, or wait-time, but that's just my experience.",

After getting annoyed by the wait I ask the employee how long to get seated and the boss looking guy comes immediately tell us there is no current seat available. After few minutes he seats us and we notice many empty tables around adding to thw annoying feeling for the place. The atmosphere looked nice and so did the menu, so getting exited to eat we order. Our server didn't  look friendly nor smiled which gave a feeling of being unwelcomed. The food arrives, looks okay, my lasagna is cold on the sides. I got way better italian food at way cheaper restaurant. My companion almost didn't  eat her plate at all, so I think she wasn't impressed either.

Not surprise, there was a short line when we got there around 7ish. The cacio e pepe can choose to add zucchini and egg yolk, which made the simple pasta more interesting and flavorful. Eggplant ravioli is also great, topped with tomato, basil and mozzarella cheese. What can go wrong with this combo? We did fried calamari as an appetizer, the calamari meat is very tender and is breaded perfectly, crispy but not too heavy. I prefer spicy mayo to tomato sauce. Service is great too.

The experience here was soured by, not only the long wait, but the fact that three groups that came after us were seated before us. So instead of waiting 20 minutes like we were told, we waited over 40. Buy that time it was 8:20, and we had things to do. So we ordered two plates of pasta and got out.  It\u2019s a shame, I like the place, the food never disappoints, but the staff does. If you go and the ma\u00eetresse says it\u2019s a 20 minute wait, either sit at the bar, or head down to Henry\u2019s End or the Wine Bar. At least you\u2019ll be seated in a timely fashion.",

A friend and I arrived at Noodle Pudding looking for an authentic serving of Italian cuisine that moved beyond the typical New York City pizza slice. There was a queue out the door, however service was moving fast, and we were seated within fifth teen minutes! Noodle Pudding, despite its misleading name, is classic old school Italian in terms of ambience, service, and quality. The menu is relatively small, but packed full of diverse flavours from across the region, with curated choices including a beautiful Rabbit Ragu dish which you wouldn\u2019t generally find at more mainstream Italian venues. All of the food we ordered was presented simply, but effectively, and absolutely sang with flavour - it\u2019s clear that Noodle Pudding take great care with regard to the quality of their dishes - the food here is just like how nonna would make it. A restaurant not to be missed when visiting New York!",

He seemed arrogant with no apology or any regret in his absence of being a waiter. We left a generous tip still because he seemed so arrognat that I assumed he has a  miserable life outside of work. Although the Host who sat us and checked in on us was marvelous and outstanding.  He deserves a full 5 stars for keeping it afloat. Quite disappointing in this experience.",

The bartender acted very busy at a 10 person bar space and after ignoring us for ten minutes criticisized my friend\u2019s taste test on her wine, literally telling her what she tasted was wrong. We were told it would be 45 minutes, and came back around then. It ended up being an hour and forty five minutes and we stayed basically to see how bad it would get. The hostess kept ignoring everyone at the door and seemed to seat whoever he knew first. It is a neighborhood place and that was clear.

However, rather confusingly, Noodle Pudding doesn't even seem to have a cover to judge it by - there's no signage on the front of the store, no clues that inside these doors is a fresh, flavorful restaurant; almost as if you had gone home to your grandmothers and she had put out a place setting for anyone walking in off the street. While most restaurants try to burnish their family focused chops, Noodle Pudding puts it front and center, sourcing in ingredients from local farms in New Jersey and \"proudly\" not accepting credit cards.  We had the fried zucchini flowers as an appetizer, filled with ricotta cheese and lightly fried mixing salty and sweet together. For a main course, I chose the Fettuccine with mussels, clams and shrimp in a shellfish ragu sauce. Amazingly spicy with a full plate of seafood, each piece almost falling out of the shell, and coated in the ragu sauce, I didn't stop eating until the plate was clean. Finally over cappuccinos and espressos, we shared a delicious sweet peaches and vanilla ice cream.",

        "caption": "I haven't had a meal out this satisfying in a long time. My friend suggested this place for dinner as she had a good experience the last time she dined here, and I must agree. The entire meal was absolutely delicious.  That being said, here are some notes about this place: - They are only open for dinner - from 5:30pm - They only take cash - They don't take reservations for parties of 6 or less - They invite you to go and wait for a table  After a 45 minute wait for a table, my three friends and I finally got settled into a nice, rear-alcove, corner table. Our waiter came by to recommend one pasta special, but said the rest was whatever was on the menu. We went completely with the menu items, decided to share everything, and ordered the following:  - Razor Clams Oreganata (4) - Clean, delicate clam flavor, dressed with a crust of seasoned bread crumbs and a squeeze of lemon juice. Yummy starter!  - Crispy-Fried NJ Whiting (2) - Two crispy-fried whole whiting. I took half of one whiting with the head and ate the entire head! That's how delicate this fish was! Delicious!  - Fried Calamari with Spicy Aioli and Lemon Wedge - Crispy, nicely-battered, good texture/bite to the calamari without being too chewy. Nicely flavored Aioli to go along with it, but not spicy at all to my palate.  - Hand-cut Linguini with Clams, Zucchini, Cherry Tomatoes and Fresh Pepper - Homemade, al dente pasta with fresh clams so clean that they were delicate in flavor. The zucchini and cherry tomatoes added another layer of freshness and texture. The entire dish together tasted more like a light pasta primavera because there was very little clam flavor coming from the clams. It could have used a dash of clam juice, but it was still good.  - Pappardelle Alla Vaccinara (oxtail ragu) with Pecorino Shavings - Homemade, al dente pasta coated with oxtail meat stewed tender. A hearty, meaty, chewy, flavorful bite with each forkful. This has a heavier, comforting mouthfeel compared to the pasta dish above. I liked having both of these dishes as a contrast in flavors and textures.  - Roasted Whole Porgy - What my friends and I especially liked about Noodle Pudding was all of their locally sourced seafood. Not only do you support local fisheries and eat sustainable species, you eat the freshest caught seafood! This whole roasted Porgy was perfectly cooked! Evenly cooked and slightly crispy skin enveloped flaky, white, tender meat. Simply seasoned with a few rosemary sprigs inside its belly, the meat was still moist but fell off the bones easily. I love fish head, so I picked all of best morsels off of the entire fish head, especially the eyes! Fish lovers will love this dish!  Dessert was: - Ricotta Cheesecake - More of a floured cake than a cheesecake, this delicious slice had bits of candied fruit that you would typically find in Panettone. Lightly sweet and moist, it also had bits of lemony flavor, which likely comes from the Citron. A lovely dessert that I would order again.  - Panna Cotta with Fresh Berries - Silky, lightly sweet, and light are the best three ways to describe Noodle Pudding's take on my favorite dessert. Everytime I see panna cotta on the menu, I always havta order it. This one did not disappoint! The fresh berries that went along with it were sweet and ripe. A great complement!  Overall, I had a delicious time at Noodle Pudding. Needless to say, I will be returning for more.",

After a beautiful walk over the Brooklyn Bridge with my wife she decided to have Italian food, so I search for good Italian restaurants within the vicinity and noodle pudding popped up due to its \"high\" rating. Upon arrival we would not greeted by anyone we had to wait for the bartender to acknowledges and flag someone down so that we can be seated... meanwhile a couple of head of us were greeted and seated with ease. Once we were seated it took literally over 6 minutes for us to receive a menu so that we can place an order. Other patrons that came in after us we're seated and given a menu immediately. Our waitress was extremely unwelcoming and did not recommend anything from the menu. Already feeling uncomfortable I just ordered calamari for myself and shrimp fettuccine for my wife. The calamari came out pretty quickly and indeed tasted very good, but we waited so long for the shrimp fettuccine that I thought they sent someone to the Hudson River to find the shrimp. After noticing patrons that came in after us receiving their entrees, I realized something was up and decided to leave. I spoke to an individual within the facility and let them know the reason why I was leaving. I just hope that we weren't treated like this due to the color of our skin.",

I ordered a bruschetta for the table, and special pasta dish -  orecchiette with meatball and basil, and a simple angel hair pasta with garlic and evoo and a pork chop dish. All were phenomenal, the pork was slightly drier than I prefer but it was nicely sear and delicious with a side of veggies and mash.",

When I finally got the attention of my waitress and voiced my concerns, she told me that they probably had those clams in the basement. She sent out a man from the kitchen who told me not to \"take it personally,\" that he knows them and they called ahead and he saved it aside for them. I asked him if a customer wants to ensure that they get something from your menu, they are supposed to know to call ahead and have it put aside??? He argued back \"Yes, that's the way it is. Sorry.\" Clearly the customer is not right, nor are they respected at Noodle Pudding.",

Pork belly was just all fat. NO meat. What kind of dish is this?! I understand that pork belly has a lot of fat.. I've eaten it at a lot of places. But if I order the entree version, I expect some meat on it!  The tagliatelle was less disappointing. It was a homecooked pasta, something you can make yourself. Not exciting. Not innovative. But this place isn't that. I recommend it if you want a down to earth meal.  But you can get this pasta anywhere else in the city, don't suffer through this long wait and horrible service for it.",

Ask your waitress/waiter which ones are fresh for the night and order ones of those.  Service is good, attentative and friendly.  The ambiance is great.  Price is fair except they don't take credit cards. Portion size is good--not huge but enough that you will definately be full.  As for the pastas, they do 1/2 orders which is great so if you can't decide between which to order, get the half sizes.  We ordered the seafood rissoto and the fettucine with shell fish.  Both were very good and heavy on the seafood.",
