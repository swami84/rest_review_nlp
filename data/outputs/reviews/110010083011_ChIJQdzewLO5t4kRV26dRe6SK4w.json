The doubles was such a fun appetizer, the herbivore tiffin box was a real flashback to childhood (comfort food), and the crispy kale was a great balance to the rest of the meal which was very stew-y and heavy.

On one hand, I was impressed that this restaurant made Trinidadian food accessible to all people. On the other, it felt somewhat forced. The prices are very high because of Cane's desire to attract higher level clientele. They have succeeded on this front!  Now onto food: I enjoyed my Curry Channa and Aloo, it was good. The spice level was a bit low, for my liking, but that's what pepper sauce is for. I, however, was really craving a top-notch doubles when I went there. This is where the restaurant fell short, in my opinion. I felt that the barra (bread) was a bit flat, the channa was watery, and there was too much channa for the barra.  The baingan, on the other hand was really good! You could tell it was really well roasted and chunk'ed (sautee'd with seasonings).  All in all, I'll be going back! I have to support my fellow Trinis. Best of luck!",

TL;DR - great food, long wait times after 6, oxtail sells out frequently, the chutneys are good but everything already has so much flavor you really don\u2019t need them.  First though, if you come anytime after 6 be prepared for a pretty long wait time, they don\u2019t take reservations and it can be anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour.  The space is really small, and a bit cramped but it\u2019s got a hole in the wall kind of atmosphere. You end up a little smushed against other customers but not so much that you\u2019d be touching. The noise level is pretty loud, but not shouting level.  The food: we haven\u2019t had something we didn\u2019t like off the menu yet.  Oxtail: very tender, fairly flavorful, and falls off the bones. This sells out pretty often later in the night so come earlier if you want to try it! Has a good amount of fat on it though, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of that probably not for you.  Crispy Kale: delicious mix of texture and flavors, the kale really is very crispy, reminiscent of the teas tire of dried seaweed without the chewiness. There are bugs of corn in here than are hard and crunchy and you don\u2019t really get the strong flavor of kale at all. Great side to mellow out the heaviness of the butter and oxtail.  Hops: the bread itself is nothing amazing, a bit dry and cold - but the butter is unique. Has a smokey flavor that really gives it its own flavor as opposed to just plain butter, I liked it, my other half not so much so to each their own! It\u2019s on the saltier side.  Eggplant choka: pretty good, nothing astounding, it was an eggplant pur\u00e9e with onions, was good to top on the hops and as a different taste to cut away from the heaviness of some of the other flavors.  Omnivore box: so good! All the components were super flavorful and the meat was very tender. We got beef and lamb and both were cooked really well. This was the first thing we tried from this restaurant and solidified our desire to come back a second time. We also got this with the chutneys but honestly everything had so many flavors already it wasn\u2019t completely necessary but still helped to change things up.",

It's for sure worth the wait, put your name on the list and wander H street until you get the text your table is ready.",

You have to jump on the waiting list on Yelp and try to time it perfectly.  With that said, the food is delicious. The doubles made me want to cancel my entree order and just order four more orders of doubles. I could go there anytime and order doubles and eat them without getting anything else. They reminded me of some doubles I got in Brooklyn once, which is hard to find in DC. They had both flavor and spice that seemed to get better with every bite.  The curried meat was perfect. The curried chickpeas and potatoes were perfect. I left there happy to spend my money and would have paid more for less food. The food was delicious.  Be prepared to wait, but it is definitely worth the wait.",

Perhaps seating 25-30 people. The service was great as our guide helped us through the menu highlighting options. We went a tad wild and ordered all the sauces possible to test them out. They ranged from sweet to hot and were compliments of nearly each dish we ordered.  The hops are dinner rolls, but perfectly cooked, warm, large, and come with outstanding smokey butter - topped with special homemade smoked salt.  Doubles was the least impressive of the dishes that came out. It was fried bread with cumin spiced channa. The bread was soft and soggy, even at the edges. It was fine, but I wouldn't order it again.  The omnivore is an array of separate individual dishes which comes in a stack of metal dishes. It contains a few meats (beef - was incredible), (chicken - solid) and then multiple other vegetables. It was a great sampling of the flavors of the restaurant.  Overall I was impressed and would go back. It's tough to get into at the moment, but if you do, it's a great experience.",

I sat down and waited for about ten minutes, and one of the waitresses told me parties don't get seated before the entire party arrives. I looked at the menu and decided to order before they arrived. I ordered the vegetarian tiffin boxes, which came with eggplant choka, tomato choka, lentils curry, potatoes curry, and paratha, as well as two chutneys. The food came out in a tower of tin boxes, and I enjoyed watching the tower become disassembled and unveiled. I loved both chokas, especially the eggplant because of its roasted flavor though it was slightly too salty. The lentils and potato curries were a bit bland and I dumped the green chutneys onto them, but they were tasty. too. The rest of my party eventually showed up, and it was a lot of food. The paratha was hot and soft, and it went well with the chokas and curries. The amount of food was a lot, and we got an extra paratha and eggplant choka. The bill came out to be around $52 post-tax and the three of us had leftovers. I would recommend it!",

We got the vegetarian Tiffan box, crispy kale, all the sauces and the Island Life cocktail. The cocktail was light and refreshing and the shrub was so flavorful. The curries were flavorful and went well it. The mango chutney, pineapple chow and culantro sauce were bomb. The bread was like nothing I have ever had. Really liked it mixed with everything. The kale was a great texture (a little on the spicy side). My friend had the wings and the doubles and loved both. I had a bite of the doubles that were great! 100% coming back! Thanks for the new experience.",

Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. My drink was refreshing with a hint of heat. Our food was brought out in a timely manner. My husband and I  were stuffed when we left and we had leftovers.  The only thing we weren't excited about was the bread pudding we took home for dessert. There were 2 different sauces, one was dark and had raisins in it which I would expect to be in the actual bread pudding. Couple of caveats: 1. It is small in size. Don't expect to bring a large party without planning ahead. 2. They don't take reservations but they use a wait list which is a good alternative, again plan ahead. 3. It is pricey for some traditional Trini dishes but unfortunately we don't have that many good options for Trini food in DC. All in though I definitely would come back and recommend trying this restaurant out.",

TBH the Yelp book ahead wasn't exactly aligned with the wait times, but we had a drink at Ethiopic while we waited. A lil honey wine ain't never hurt nobody. There will be a wait. There will be a wait. THERE WILL BE A WAIT. And it's oh so worth it! I was blown that the three of us ended up at the bar instead of a table where we could see each other's faces and chat, but the kind waitstaff, bartender and delicious food made up for everything you've read thus far. My husband is \"Trini to di bone\" and was so cute explaining all his favorite and known dishes on the menu. The waitstaff weighed in jovially affirming all his explanations while providing an Americanized twist so we understood all the deliciousness we were about to consume. We ordered so much food. The doubles were divine! The geera pork hit hard! And the omnivore paratha tiffin box was your standardly delicious bussupshot and curry beef and chicken. We could not finish it all. In fact, two days later we reheated the roti in the oven and went to town on the leftovers...it was STILL good. Even the pepper sauce (which is called Cane Juice) tasted similar to that my aunt in law makes from scratch. We also ordered the pepper pot, which was divinely stewed meat that melted in your mouth. This is not just real Carribean food, this is authentic Trinidadian food. My husband was in heaven and mentioned the need to bring the family chef here for her critique soon. We will be back! Don't sleep. Don't delay. Go to Cane today!  ...next time I'll get the escovetch because it looked liked it wanted me to eat it when the lady next to us landed her meal and the jerk wings because you know, I'm sure Chef Primeval did it better than these other wannabe Carribean places. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

        "caption": "Met up with friends to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday.  Went to Cane, the new popular Trini streetfood restaurant and run shop in the H Street Atlas district.  Pluses: food is phenomenal and very flavorful. The portions are perfect. The presentation is beautiful. The wait time for food to come out after order is reasonable. Not too long.  Menu limited which is good bc you don\u2019t have too many choices to drive you crazy. Just pepperpt, oxtails or fish.  (See menu)  Or you can order either a meat eaters or a vegetarian array of small dishes that come out in a stacked colanders (see video)  And that comes with paratha roti skins.  There is also an array of chokas (cauliflower, tomato, eggplant, cabbage) (see photos)  Appetizers are poulouri &doubles or wings or cow heel soup (see photo)  Mehs :  They don\u2019t take reservations so the wait can be over an hour (but you can get on the wait list via YELP)  We did and still waited 30 minutes to get seated and could not get a table even then but instead the bay window seat for large parties).  There is one large group table. One.  The bar only seats 4 so you cannot wait inside the venue for a table to come available so if it is raining and you got there by Uber you have to wait outside in the rain  There was a steady stream of people and folks lingering outside waiting for their table! It is very popular.  The price is reasonable but fish is market price and when we went a small whole crispy escovitch red snapper was $38 (see photo) and a large is $68!  Current and modern Soca and reggae music pipes overhead.  Overall, a great place to go but prepare for the wait.  You leave feeling full and satisfied.",

The staff makes you feel like family. Always checking on you and lots of laughs! I was impressed by the owner because he was approachable, quick to ask if we needed anything else and took the time to answer questions about the place. I love the atmosphere, good vibes, welcoming people, reggae, afro beats, and a splash of R&B. I ordered the carnival drink and my daughter had the sorrell; drinks were made to perfection!  STARTERS: I ordered the Pholourie and Hops. The Pholourie was light and delicious. The Hops is served with a spicy butter; it's just the right amount of spicy(not to hot but more flavorful)  MAIN DISH: I wish I could have sat down with the chef, he adds a little something special to each traditional dish. I ordered a small escovitched snapper which is served with a coconut lime rice. My sides were cabbage, and  eggplant. I couldn't finish it! It's not your normal escovited snapper. I'm going to try and mimick this dish at home, it was that good! My daughter had the pepper pot with the coconut lime rice and cabbage! The meat was tender and full of flavor and the rice was cooked just right.  We had to skip dessert..but I saw waiters serving ice cream cones...as much as we wanted to try it there was absolutely no room left in our tummies :p  TIPS: #1 Call ahead and get on the wait list. The place is packed and people are constantly trying to get in and soak up some good vibes and great food!  #2 Leave room for dessert ;)",

It was a nice day so we waited out front.  20 minutes turned into an hour and my guest noticed that others were just walking in and being seated.  Next, the food is decent at best, and extremely over priced. $19 for oxtails - and you only get two on this tiny plate.  I expected a nice sized bowl for that price.  Finally, they make a limited number of drinks - mostly Caribbean inspired. So if you're looking for a whiskey or anything like that, you'll have to settle for a rum and coke or some fruity type of drink.",
