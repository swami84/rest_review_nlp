It's always nice to have a place where the vegetarian/vegan options don't feel like consolation prizes. Have a family member with a gluten allergy, so the fact that the whole menu is GF/DF makes it even better!  The chile plantains are a MUST ORDER! Next time I'm ordering a large!  Chips and salsa was small, but delicious. You can tell that this is the kind of place that makes everything with care, down to the sauces.  If you get one of the combos and are sharing with another person, consider ordering extra tortillas!",
