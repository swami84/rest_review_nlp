The person who answered the phone, Alex, was amazing. He took his time explaining the covid procedures, the seating and the parking. We felt welcome before we got there. Our waiter Sky was just as nice. The food was amazing. We had the shrimp appetizer and jerk Mac and cheese. Absolutely delicious! Great food and great service. Alex assured us that even though the parking was a bit sketchy, we would be ok and we were. He checked on us a few times to reassure our comfort.",

The food was amazing and the drinks were very well prepared. You have to stop by, tell them Pat- Karizma sent you. Lamb chops and shrimp were the absolute best.",

They can keep the jerk mac&cheese,  i didn't like that.  The bartender name Lola is a Boss,  she broke down everything....she explained about the organic wines etc, she was very friendly and detail. Its a new and different local  Restaurant lounge....i don't think there is a place that is offering Organic wines/alcohol and food in Harlem. Only con....its very small in side and the kitchen doesn't open until 5, best that .This restaurant is a must try.",

I enjoyed a Bellini and fresh fruit red sangria while Michael Jackson blared from the speakers. I ordered the brunch burrito and couldn\u2019t refrain from also ordering the Jerk Mac N Cheese. Both were extremely favorable and seasoned to perfection. The menu has tons of options and they were very attentive to my shellfish allergy. If you\u2019re ever uptown and in search of a delicious meal with great service or even just drinks...... we can\u2019t forget the drinks! Stop by and check it out.",
