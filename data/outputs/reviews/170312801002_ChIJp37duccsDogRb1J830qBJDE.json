I was expecting a real dive.  When I walked in I almost didn't stay because the place is so nice.  But Jackson the bartender immediately greeted me and made me feel welcome.  When he found out that I was a tourist, he kicked in to tour guide mode and suggested several places for me to visit. The chopped salad was great and the pizza was excellent!  The service was superb and the prices were on par.  I highly recommend Vinny's!",

On my two visits (both for lunch) the place was pretty empty, so a wait time isn't something to worry about. That said, service was extremely, extremely slow both times. There was only one person working the whole restaurant, which when it's not busy, I understand, but there still needs to be attentiveness - especially when drinks go dry.  I did have the chance to meet the chef on my first visit, though, and he was gracious and friendly! He explained some of the restaurant's pizza-making processes and was genuinely a super fun guy to talk to.  The pizza is pretty tasty; I've had it twice and was happy on both occasions.  I had the margherita and the cheese pizza pie loaded with veggies. The prices are a little higher than an average lunch spot, though. An Italian beef sandwich or chicken parm will set you back $14.

And id say the prices were reasonable for downtown but honestly they were reasonable for anywhere. We had a large pizza meatball sub pasta salad cheese sticks and calamari and our bill was $50.

Menu looked OK so we all ordered individual pizzas. We waited for more than 30 minutes, but there was no sign of pizza coming. That hit our threshold. It was ridiculous we have to wait for 30 minutes for food during lunch time. I am not sure how good the foods would be because we left without eating, but it didn't meet our critical time requirement. We went back to the French market and it took only 30 minutes from ordering to finishing eating. One of our team members missed his meeting due to this delay. We will never waste time with this place again.",

Diversity is here and how you treat someone should not be based on skin color or who is paying. It should be based upon them being a human being not to mention they are part customer and honestly how do you know i could've been the one being treated because i helped the person paying prior and possibly referring my colleagues to be spending way more the next time based on my initial experience. Thanks Kelly for pre-judging. But the food was good all in all. The place is great but like Starbucks I think eveyone/company should have some sort of ethical training (sad to say it's needed anywhere)",
