I wouldnt of thought of it as a big deal but i waited 30 minutes and customers that walked in to be seated were served their food first. Really did not care for the customer service and there excuse of being short staffed on a weekend. Food quality great so i give it 3 stars you can really ruin a person experience with poor customer service and ignoring the customers.

I ordered the fish tacos which used to be incredible but they changed them. They are now different and saying that they were \"ok\" is being generous. The beer is still great so that's why I gave it 3 stars.",

A peach whiskey drink with jack Daniels that was light on the whiskey. and mango mojito that tasted like dirty old sprite. It was way too much seltzer or something.  I was also hungry so I was not that interested in the drink but I usually like to enjoy a mojito with dinner.  2) APPETIZERS/FOOD: The food was not good either.! It was pretty bad. I sent back the artichoke crab dip because the cheese tasted like hot thousand island dressing and the crostinis were either old or cooked with too much oil or something. This is my first trip to this location.  I\u2019ve had food at the restaurant in Waikiki/Honolulu area that was amazing (I also wrote a review about that location). The Cajun wings were a little over cooked and just not great flavor. The shrimp and lobster tacos were really bland.  Only two of the three tacos had shrimp.  3.) SERVICE: The service was ok. I was waited on at the bar by a young lady named Savannah who was nice.  She was friendly and kept checking on me and didn\u2019t have any problem when I needed to send back the appetizer. The bar back Or other server was a guy who assisted but I couldn\u2019t tell if he was supposed to be there because initially when I sat down he was just there talking to her about schedules or the weekend for about ten minutes while she went back and forth serving. I didn\u2019t get his name because he never introduced himself or even asked if I needed anything until I was done with my food and he wanted to get my plates out of the way.  Presumably so I could leave faster.  He was eager to help the other people that came to the bar not sure if it was because I was the only black person at the bar or they just had a system set up while it was busy that he would help everyone except one or two people.  But it did seem like he was ignoring me while he washed dishes right in front of me and practically splashing dish water in my food. The other female bartender was just making the servers drinks which is understandable but she did at least acknowledge me and have someone get me a menu when I sat down. I\u2019ve been a server /bartender for years before my current job so I know how busy Saturday nights can get.  you can not have people at the bar that are not very friendly or give the appearance of being discriminatory towards a certain group. That is unacceptable service. He also seemed to ignore the other black man that sat on the opposite side of the bar but that was just my experience. Im sure that is not the standard. Overall it was not a great experience and I would not come back to this location unless I was with a group that just wanted drinks or something. The downtown area is a nice place to go with a group for a night out.",

The waiters were attentive and helpful in letting our group know what options were faster for the kitchen staff to prepare. The chicken and mushroom pasta was the perfect portion for lunch - although a bit pricy at ~$15 for this bowl.. a friend had the shrimp and mango tacos (a filling 3 tacos and black beans). Minus one star just for a little confusion during the handing out/collection of checks. Otherwise a great experience! The appetizers looked delicious, and their drink menu looked excellent. Definitely coming back when we have more time to enjoy our food!",

But she requested the Shrimp be replaced with grilled chicken.  Terence didn\u2019t even have to ask the kitchen. He bragged that everything was made from scratch and so that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  The food was great. They had so many beers to choose from. My wife decided to get a flight and let Terence pick for her.  The menu says 5 for 5, but they brought out 6. She loved all but one which was a little too hoppy for her liking.  The darkest beer was very smooth.",

I personally ordered a Scharzbier and a Marzen and I liked both of them! Speaking of, I forgot to mention, I really like their fish and chips. Since coming back from London, I had not had any good fish and chips until I came into GB. Most places I've been to since returning to the US, put too much batter into the fish.",

The first night I went I was on my own and got a Kobe burger, one of their craft beers and some of their wings. I really enjoyed the food, and the beer. The waitress, and trainee, did a great job and made it easy for the return visit. This time I came with 3 co-workers. I pretty much ordered the same thing, but this time what a difference. Our waitress was not very attentive to us. We had to ask other staff for refills. As we ordered the wings she did not bother to ask if we wanted bone in or boneless. Our mistake as we should have specified as we got boneless. They tasted good but not what we really wanted. The presentation of the food was like they just put it on the plate and brought it out. It was a night and day difference from my first visit. This is why the lower ranking as the food was still great, but the service the second time left no one impressed. To be  honest we talked less about our meal and more on how bad out experience was. There was only 2 of us from out of town and the 2 locals were even surprised about the visit.",

We waited about 20 minutes after being seated for anyone to take our drink order. We then waited about 30 minutes to get our drinks and order our food. After ordering, we waited an hour to get our food. We were seated by the kitchen window and saw portions of our food sit under the heat lamps for at least 45 minutes. Our server didn\u2019t know beers at all and had no clue as to which beer was actually on tap. Their electronic beer menu was out of date. Out of the four beers we attempted to order from said menu were not on tap. When we got our food my pizza, one of the 45 minute heat lamp items, was limp and rubbery. One girl sent her sausages back because she watched them sit for so long. The manager happened to be serving her the food and when she brought it out was short and didn\u2019t give an apology. Our server was slow and spent most of her time at the computer talking to other servers. It was a horrible experience.",

        "caption": "Just got here. Menu didn't show prices, waiter didn't know the prices, didn't offer to find them out. One price that was on the menu was that beers were 3 dollars on Tuesday. I tried to order a 3 dollar beer, per the menu, the waiter informed me that that deal no longer exists.  Not a great first impression, hope our drinks are good!  Update: My flight of beers came out, it's a flight of 6, instead of 5 like was on the menu. Came with a sheet that shows the beers, so clearly this is intentional. Hopefully I get charged properly!  Update 2: My wife ordered a tea half an hour ago and reminded the waiter once. Still no sign of it, but he has tried to sell us more. Interesting, since we haven't gotten what we ordered initially.  Final update: The drink that never showed up was comped, and brought out in a to-go cup. Still was the wrong drink, but a step in the right direction. He then brought out the correct drink. He also comped a soda my friend had gotten. My flight was charged properly.  It seemed the waiter was busy, and perhaps flustered. If this is the case, on a Tuesday night, perhaps Gordon Biersch needs to hire more staff.  All in all, my purchase was fine, but the service was pretty bad. I'll bump it up to 2 stars for the comp, but overall a pretty terrible experience from the start.",

If we were smart, we would've gotten up and left at this point.  We ordered our meals and an appetizer, and thankfully the app came out quickly. After that the server did not come back to our table for at least 30 minutes. All around us parties were asking to speak to a manager and referencing having been there nearly 45 minutes without receiving any food. We were just about to get up and leave, after waiting nearly an hour for our food to come out, when the meals finally arrived. The waitress' exact words were \"I hope everything came out well, it should've for how long it took.\"  Huge shock, the food was terrible. The chicken on 2 of our meals was cold, and tasted as if it had been sitting for 30+ minutes. Then, the waitress was too preoccupied with other angry parties to notice that our drinks were empty & that we were clearly not satisfied with our food, as 3/4 meals went almost entirely uneaten. We were in a rush to get to an event, so we did not have time to stay and argue with a manager who had already been to 4 different tables around us to try and calm down angry customers.  If it were possible to give this restaurant 0 stars, I certainly would.",

My salad was not worth the $16 price tag. The steak pieces were overcooked and tough. The dressing was good but not remarkable.  My boyfriend is allergic to dairy- the waitress brought him his entre with 1 of the 2 sides missing, and never actually noticed for the entire meal. The fries had parmesan cheese on them. The remainder of his meal was 3 sausages. What a hearty meal....  Id advise any out of towners to not even bother with this place.",

We thought we would give GB a try since they have many selections on their menu and that is a plus for my family's diverse tastes. Service - 3 stars.  Ambiance - 3.5 stars.  Food - 1 star.  My daughter and I split a 10 inch pepperoni pizza that was more like a 7 inch pizza + 3 inch crust.  The dough/crust dominated this pie and the sauce, cheese, and pepperoni were minimal.  Taste was just ok.  Do not order this!  My other daughter ordered the fish tacos and she said they were very bland.  My third daughter ordered the ciabatta turkey sandwich and there was a watery spread that dripped out with every bite.  She was not thrilled.  My wife ordered a chicken slider and side kale & quinoa salad and she was satisfied with both.  I had a Golden Export lager, which reminded me of Bud Light....nothing special about this beer at all.  Bottom line is that I left there with the strong feeling that I will never enter a GB restaurant again...one and done.",

While the food was decent the service left a bitter taste in my mouth. As we sat at our table our server \"Steven\" greeted us in a friendly way, took our drink and food order and then the next time we saw him was a half an hour later when he brought out 1 person's food. Everyone at the table had poor spirits, empty cups and a hunger left unsatisfied. Within two hours everyone finally had their food thanks to another server who proceeded to apologize for Steven's service and helped please everyone at the table. The first time Steven ever asked our table if we needed anything was right after our new server had delivered all of our food and refills. My suggestion if you decide to come here and your server is named steven, just leave.",
