Came with my girlfriends on a Thursday night and let me tell you we thoroughly enjoyed our drinks, deserts, hookah and more! First off, there was a dj spinning on a Thursday night with really good music, it wasnt those obnoxious loud club songs so we were able to still have conversation and hear each other. The deCor was very romantic and elegant with a large gold mirror at the bar and hanging light fixtures, the red wall lighting made it very romantic. Service was quick and we love our waitress she was very attentive! We had dinner prior to this so we only tried deserts and drinks! Definitely try the strawberry cheese cakes and baklava they were super tasty reminds me of those homemade ones. The hookah was very flavor full we had the strawberry banana and it lasted super long since we were there until midnight enjoying the music. This is truly a gem of a place with great ambiance and laid back vibe. Cant wait to come back this weekend and try more of there food plus our waitress said there's Dj's on the weekends too! Found my new spot in Bk that has manhattan vibes but without actually going to the city for over price food and drinks! I highly recommend!!",

I get my order and it\u2019s \u201cwell\u201d and had tomato so now I can\u2019t even eat the the entire order. This was done on purpose I called and asked them get the complete it was like soMe one was upset that I was ordering late. I get home from work really late and needed something to eat now I\u2019m home and can\u2019t eat the order at all. I tried to call the restaurant at 1:00 am but no one answers the call even though they say they close at 2am. I want a full refund for my order I\u2019ll calling grub hub tomorrow. I don\u2019t recommend this restaurant to anyone. I could have ended up in the hospital because of their neglect to pay attention to ticket instructions.",

Ordered linguini over the phone and the person said one price that matches price on their website, but 15 min later was charged $7 extra due to lame explanation of their \u201cdinner\u201d pricing. I definitely do not recommend this place.  Update: I indeed got a refund in full. However I didn\u2019t like that at first when I addressed this issue, the barmen just shrugged his shoulder without even trying to solve this issue in the first place. That\u2019s when I wrote this review. While I was sharing my experience with deli store next door to this place, I\u2019ve been advised to go back to return the order and request a full refund. Only upon my return and determination to get a refund, I was approached by someone in charge. I was not told at that time that I\u2019m being refunded in full, in fact that person just told me that he refunded a difference in \u201cI\u2019m so annoyed\u201d tone. There were no apologies whatsoever. The food is decent there, but the lack of customer service and different pricing in their menu vs website vs daytime vs nighttime is too much for my liking, thus I still do not recommend this place. However I\u2019ll add 2 more stars to my review due to being refunded in full and decent meal.",
