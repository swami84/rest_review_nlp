We were there for a while and they never once hassled us. They were very friendly and engaged us in conversation and we're great with the kids.

The other issue is the menu itself. I went with my parents, and their menus had different descriptions of the dishes than mine did, but the same dish names listed, which made it practically impossible to know what we were actually ordering. The drinks menus were also inconsistent, with one having about twice as many beer options than the other, many of which they didn't actually have. We also ended up just ordering what the waitress directed rather than what we had picked for ourselves, so it's a little hard to know how the other food would have been. At any rate, we ended up having a perfectly good meal, but not without considerable confusion and uncertainty.",
