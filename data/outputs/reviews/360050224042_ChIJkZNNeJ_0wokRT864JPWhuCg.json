The food out looked kinda fresh but idk also like last nights food. Anyway she went to the back for the oxtail. I\u2019m thinking okay maybe it\u2019s a fresh batch. I asked if she put gravy, she said yes. I get home and not only is there no gravy, it\u2019s more like the oil from the gravy she put. Also the food was TERRIBLE. DRY AND TASTELESS. I tried to wait the go try to eat again, but nahhh I\u2019m good. NO DISRESPECT but I mixed it with my Dogs food and gave it to him. Only because oxtail isnt cheap and I\u2019m was annoyed to dispose it. So my dog devoured it. Hey at least my money didn\u2019t go to waste. But I won\u2019t return here",

Returned home and have been missing that island taste until I came across TOP CHOICE Jamaican and West Indian restaurant at 746 Lydig Ave, Bronx, NY 10462. This is the flavor of the dishes I remembered, real authentic. There are only four tables for dining so this is mainly an order and go place, I don\u2019t mind that as I really like to \u201cdig in\u201d to their food and that might become embarrassing. I am always greeted with a smile by the staff and everything I have tried on the menu has been excellent (plan on making my way through entire menu). If ever in this part of town and wanting a savory meal I recommend you give this place a visit.",
