The restaurant was half full and the interior was beautifully designed and decorated. The customer service was also outstanding which made the night even better. Our server was very attentive and helpful through  the evening.  We started off with a couple of drinks. Some sangria and a Pina de mi ojo. Both were pricey. As for the food, it was definitely pricey as well, with some dishes that stood out and some that weren't tasty at all.  Datiles con almendras: The best tapa of the night unfortunately came first. Bacon wrapped dates with marcona almonds topped with la peral fondue. A sweet and savory dish with an interesting touch and the end of the bite when you bite into an almond. $10  Pan con tomate: I read a lot of reviews comparing this to bruschetta. There is no comparison. Bruschetta usually is full of flavor. This however was just tomato's spread on top of crispy sourdough that wasn't very crispy. Could barely taste any olive oil. $7  Gambas de ajillo: This tapa was actually quite tasty. Shrimp in garlic, shrimp and birds eye chili that gave it a nice kick. $14  Patatas bravas; I've had better but these weren't bad. Just a little plain. Just potatoes covered in salsa brava, garlic aioli and chili oil. $9  Canelons de sant esteve con jarrete de buey: short rib filled cannelloni, with farm chicken foie Gras, and creamy truffle bechamel. This one sounded good but tasted to gamey. The cannelloni also added a weird slimy texture that was unappetizing. $15  Bunuelos Del ampurdan: You get three fried beignets with lemon cream and salted butter sauce. These weren't bad but coulld have used about triple the amount the say us they provides us with. $10  Overall, it was a great night and lovely dinner, but at the end of day, there's better tasting tapas in the city, and for a lot less. I wouldn't completely leave Mercat off the list, but probably wouldn't return anytime in the near future.",

Most tasting menus I try, attempt to give guest a unique experience by combining flavors and experimenting with ingredients that don\u2019t normally go together. It\u2019s always an interesting experience but sometimes some dishes are more interesting then they are good. At Mercat a la Planxa they don\u2019t go that direction and instead their tasting menu is a greatest hits of their tapas. This results in a delicious and memorable dinner and at $55 per person also one of the cheapest tasting menus I\u2019ve ever done. The cocktails were also very good/strong and made a good companion with the dishes. Will come back again!",

I accidentally made my reservation for the wrong day, but thankfully the staff was able to accommodate my party. Got a paella, three tapas, and three glasses of sangria for my group of three. Enjoyed the ambiance, was able to get a seat near the window which looked across the street to grant park. Friendly staff, bathroom is in the hotel lobby and very clean. Would recommend if you're ever in Chicago and have a craving for tapas.",

We were given the wrong menus when we were seated - it was 1:30 pm on Saturday which is brunch but we were given dinner menus. Our server only realized this once we tried to order food. 2. Slow service! 3. Our table didn\u2019t have silverware, napkins, or salt and pepper. We didn\u2019t realize this until we got our food and we had to flag down someone to get these items. 4. Server who brought food did not offer any butter, jam, or ketchup for our brunch items. We had to ask for this separately. 5. Amount of syrup given for the torrijas brioche French toast was minuscule and we had to ask for more. 6. Our server dropped off our check as we were STILL EATING and we hadn\u2019t even asked. 7. Got an email from OpenTable where I had booked the reservation a few hours later that we were a NO SHOW despite telling the staff that we had a reservation! Now I have to explain that we actually did show up! Work I have to do thanks to the ignorance of the staff. 8. Too costly for what we got.",

Docking a point because they told us the paella had certain allergens (that we noted at the beginning of the meal) only after it was brought to the table. The paella itself was only ok (it was pretty salty), but we probably would have ordered something else for the table if we knew that our allergic diner could not eat any of the paellas, we chose the one we ordered because it was the only one whose menu listings left out his other allergens. Either way, would not order the paella again even if it was edible to my whole party.",

When I asked for drink recommendations he said, \"How about Gin and tonic?\" When I said I was looking for something  like a signature drink, he said it is. He was fast and the drinks were good but he was lacking any personality and engagement what so ever. I am not kidding when I say he said no more than 10 words in the hour we sat at the bar waiting for a table drinking almost $100 dollars in drinks. Now the waiter was phenomenal! Great knowledge of the food and helped with our table of 3's decisions. We had the Octopus, Calamari, Sardines, Bacalao, Bacon wrapped figs, Short rib ravioli, wine and desert. I did find a pea sized piece or foil in one dish, but being culinarian's we understood these things happen and didn't demand a discount. They sent out a free Tapas and a round of desert \ud83c\udf7e! Half the food was phenomenal the other I thought was missing some salt, and the beef short rib ravioli was flat... Needed acid and salt. All in all, I would go here again if I had the same waiter but would substitute some other dishes in.",

The traditional artisanal cheese platter had great cheese, but the accompanying condiments were subpar (mostly sour). My boyfriend loved his calamari though so maybe the meat dishes are better! Overall, we got two drinks and three tapas plates with a total of $80+ including tip, which is quite pricey in comparison to taste and service. Worth checking out at least once for the ambiance though!",

The outcome was somewhat mixed. The pimientos padron was not really up to the level, the batatas bravas were interesting (both on the picture), while the setas al horno and the croquetas de jamon were good, and could be offered in Spain without loosing face. Service was competent, but not more than that. Overall, we could return there if in a rush to eat spanish - total cost per person was around 40 US$ (with bier). The view on the park is nice - if you are on the right place in the restaurant, so do not count on it necessarily.",

The Decour is absolutely beautiful, The hints of color in the dining room really stand out and I can tell were strategically placed to be appealing to the eyes. We ordered a pitcher of sangria to share which was strong but good. I ordered two things: green salad with cheese along with meat balls  that had Yogurt and I was very content at the end. The bread went perfectly with everything served at the table which is the way it should be. Everything everyone else ordered was good also and I can\u2019t wait to go back. This place is DEF a gem.",

Unfortunately, they were out of at least 3 of the most interestingly sounding  (meat/seafood) Tapas, which left us with mostly vegetarian dishes to choose. We were surprised since it was a slow day with maybe 5-6 tables being occupied. The Tapas tasted soso, and the ingredients didn't shine. Most sauces were either too bland, others were laden with Cayenne or red pepper powder, meaning they were just spicy without any additional complexity in the heat or flavor. The portion size of the Tapas was too large. A single person probably won't be able to have more than 3 Tapas. Expect to rack up a rather substantial bill, since many Tapas cost more than $10. Alcoholic beverages are also quite expensive. E.g., a Sangria is $12...",

I also ordered octopus which was tough (which for octopus can be somewhat forgiven) but it also had little flavor and what flavor was there was mostly salt; I found it disappointing. The salad I was served because it was made in error and the kitchen didn't want to throw it out was good, with crunchy walnuts and salty bacon lardons and bleu cheese and a sherry shallot viniagrette that was really good. Unfortunately the bleu cheese was overpowering and made the whole salad very strong and salty, but not inedible by any means. I'd return to try other options on the menu for the great ambiance, drinks, and service, and would definitely have the dates again while there.",

The bartender was kind enough to let me know the main dining was upstairs main area. Went up the spiral stair aside the front of bar.  Going upstairs was a whole different view.  Needless to say Dante, our waiter, was the main reason for the enjoyable evening. He was well versed on the entire menu and the whole Catalonia experienxe. He even spoke some as well. He explained everything in detail. We tried so many things, and actually lingered on the Mesa a la Mercat charcuterie and cheese boards. Wow, they were so good. Then afterwards, so many things cane out including the gambas, which were so juicy. It was a smorgasbord of flavors and textures. I would be remiss if I did not mention the host. I don't know his name but he came back a few times to check on us. What a great guy and he is a connoisseur of Bourbons!!!  Almost the last people to exit,  Dante had us try the Catalonia dessert. We thought we were so full, but in the end, nothing was left of the dessert!  What a great experience dining at Mercat!",

I got several small tapas, including Chorizo, tater tots with aioli, prawns, and flat bread. the flat bread and chorizo were perfect. The tots and prawns were excellent but could have used a touch more sauce. The cheesecake for dessert was phenomenal. Will be back when it is open.",
