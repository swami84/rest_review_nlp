I knew there was Auntie\u2019s Pretzel next door but on my way, just as I waked into the building I saw these pretzels and decided to try. Almond crunch bites were the excellent choice!  Pretzel bites itself are very soft, combination of sweet cream and crunchy almond (it is really crunchy) is perfect. Highly recommend!",
