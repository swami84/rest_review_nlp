But this is common, as a lot of Chinese restaurants that specialize in stirfry and the like will have a little bit of dim sum and bao. But, no complaints.  I\u2019m a big believer in going with what it looks like the specialty the house is. And I saw a lot of signs and pictures and other signs pointing me towards won ton min and beef stew soup noodle.  So I got the combo. Combination wonton beef stew min. Not a dish I\u2019ve ever seen or had. I was very pleasantly surprised.  They gave me the noodles with the braised beef plus gravy and some blanched broccoli in one container. Wontons were there as well. Broth in a separate container. The wontons weren\u2019t piping hot. But the broth was so I put the wontons in the broth and ate the beef gravy broccoli noodle bit by itself.  A very enjoyable dish I almost felt like I had three dishes. Wontons broth and a gravy noodle. The broth was a little under salted. But as it was intended to be added to the gravy, I see where they  were going. Overall very impressed.",
