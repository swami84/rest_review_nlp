Also included were their white beans, kalmetta olives, and sun dried tomatoes. Also a home run. My wife had the mushroom bisque which she said was not tasty but I found quite good. She also had their Spinach Caesar which she loved. Service was good but our server spent the first part of our stay talking to another server and laughing. Not good. I am not against comraderi but take it into the kitchen and not out in the restaurant. After I kind of pointed that out, service was great. We\u2019ll go back!",

The signature drinks were equally amazing, including the pineapple mojito\ud83d\udc4c. Their craft beer selection was extensive, although there weren\u2019t any draft selections. The bad, we were 7 minutes late to our reservation and were told they would have to check if they could still take us. When we rounded the corner into the dining area, half the restaurant was empty \ud83e\udd14. The ugly, my girl ordered the filet and I got the duck. For an app we got the crab cakes. Our food took more than 2 HOURS to come out and the steak was easily well done, as we ordered it Med Rare. I waited another 20 minutes for her steak to come back out before we were both eating. Just to be clear, almost 2.5 hours from the minute we ordered til when we were eating out entree. Now they said they were down a chef, but \u201cso is life\u201d. With a restaurant half full, absolutely inexcusable.  They gave us free drinks and a desert on the house (creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which had a hint of butterscotch flavor), which is definitely appreciated. Still, dinner shouldn\u2019t take 4 hours.  Again, I put 4 stars even considering the experience. Food was really good.",

Every time we have been there, the food has been outstanding (brunch or dinner, salads, appetizers, muffins, entrees, desserts, you name it)! Not to mention, the service is phenomenal, Gary is our favorite! When we got engaged, we contacted Clif at Paramount since we wanted to have our wedding rehearsal dinner there. Clif was so helpful throughout the entire process, answered all of our questions and gave us great advice for that night! He even catered to our interests and put their delicious banana cheesecake (our favorite dessert) on the menu for one of the desserts. We had the side room completely to ourselves and our 30 guests. The room was set up perfectly and it was such a comfortable and intimate atmosphere. The food was absolutely delicious, all of our guests raved about how great everything turned out. The wine and beer options were fabulous. And the service was impeccable as always! Highly recommend Paramount for any occasion. We can\u2019t wait to go back for some more delicious food!

The rooms fill with the echoes of neighboring dinner tables small talk conversations, and the lighting is enough to fill the room while simultaneously creating visual space between your table and the other customers. The menu unintentionally communicates the sophistication of a traditional French restaurant, there are more wines and beers to choose from than any sane person would have the time to read through yet the food choices can be counted on your left palm. Don't be fooled though, each dish is a perfect blend of spices, carbohydrates, proteins and the chiefs quirky creativity. The service is like a well oiled machine, as the servers pace through the rooms delivering food and drinks they provide quick no fuss service. Overall a great experience.",

We had a private room that had a wonderful decor, an incredible staff of servers that did their jobs in a highly effective manner without any disruption to the party.  The food was served in a timely manner and was \"hot\"...we have no idea how they managed to produce so many dishes within and serve within minutes to a group of 35 individuals.  The entrees included an awesome duck, a filet that melted in your mouth, and an Ahi tuna that was cooked to perfection.  I appreciate the way the servers recognized times when toasts were being made - they ensured the glasses were filled and then stepped out of the room to provide privacy as appropriate.  In addition to the entrees, we had two appetizers, including a crab cake (to die for) , a choice of two salads, and two desserts.  Everything was done to PERFECTION...Period...it simply could not have been better...although I think I could have eaten about 4 or 5 of the creme brulee deserts...wow.  Finally, we want to recognize the ease of working with Chef Nelson...he was extremely good to work with, he returned phone calls in a timely manner and/or emailed whichever was best at the time.  He made it so easy to host this event and we felt as though the price was exceptional for what we were served.  In closing, we looked into a number of locations to host our dinner and did not find any place that offered the privacy and decor provided by the Paramount Grill.  The Chef was amazing to work with, the food was STELLAR, and the staff was magnificent.  Our dining experience was EXCEPTIONAL...Thank you to everyone there for your hard work, attention to detail, and sincere motivation to make our dining experience everything we dreamed it would be.",
