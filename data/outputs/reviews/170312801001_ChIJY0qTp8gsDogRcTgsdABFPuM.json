Well-deserving of repeated adulations, Saigon Sisters is exceptional in its cuisine, service, and its tenacity to survive an ongoing pandemic.  My friends and I discovered this hidden gem near the Chicago River when I had a desperate craving for Banh Mi one July afternoon. At first, I was uneasy about eating indoors anywhere given COVID-19, but our host and restaurant-owner, Dan, made us feel right at home and assertively followed indoor-dining restrictions. The food was SO GOOD that we came back three times that week\u2014to enjoy more Fresh Shrimp and Pork Spring Rolls, Banh Baos, and Vietnamese Coffee.  Over the past eight months, I have sampled almost everything on the menu\u2014from Papaya Salad and Pho to Bo Luc Lac (beef tenderloin) and BBQ Eggplant\u2014and I truly love every dish. The crown jewels of the menu are the Laksa and the Whole Branzino. It goes without saying that you should definitely make room for the desserts\u2014such as the Bread Pudding (with Vietnamese-style whipped cream) and Fried Baos.  Beyond the bold fusion of flavors, Saigon Sisters offers plenty of vegetarian/vegan, gluten-free, and Halal dishes\u2014which I can attest are equally (if not more!) delicious. In addition, the extensive non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverage offerings (especially the Saigon 75 cocktail) are very refreshing.  Mary, co-owner and behind-the-scenes food visionary, is constantly innovating in the kitchen. While she pushes the culinary boundaries, her esteemed mother plants the roots on homestyle recipes (such as her special prawn crackers)\u2014as a testament to their homeland of Vietnam from where they became refugees to the US.  Their motto of hospitality and culinary excellence extends beyond their Lake Street restaurant and outposts at the French Market and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. During the pandemic, Mary collaborated with fellow womxn and immigrant-run, independent restaurants to offer cross-cuisine menu packages which\u2014besides exciting even the most scrupulous of foodies\u2014provided an inspirational level of support and fellowship in these difficult times.  Saigon Sisters is an esteemed staple in the effervescent Chicago food scene. And yet, Dan and Mary treat you like family whether you\u2019re a first-time diner or a frequent flyer like myself. On your future dining (and carry-out!) excursions, be sure to visit Saigon Sisters!",

I was pleasantly surprised to be able to enjoy a meal with \u201cdine in\u201d option. I enjoyed my meal mid afternoon and there was only one other table occupying the restaurant at the time. I was first greeted by Clark over the phone when I was inquiring about current dine in and also at the front door upon check in. His attitude and demeanor was so kind and upbeat. Dan, founder/owner was also in the restaurant when I arrived and also had warm greetings. As I mentioned, I was in the mood for Pho in a cold afternoon and this really hit the spot. Between Clark and Dan, I was treated like royalty and have not had such nice service bestowed upon me in quite some time! They helped me customize my Pho experience by asking if I needed something spicy and some extra fish sauce. It was so comforting! I was also surprised that they had a nice selection of gourmet teas, signature cocktails, and other spirits available (I did not review the menu too much before coming in). As I was asking questions about the menu items, Dan ended up giving me a tasting plate of the Octopus with Rice & Squid Ink on the house! WOW was it good too. I also ordered some delicious fried rolls. I found out Dan\u2019s wife is in the kitchen and her mom still cooks there too! I kind of felt like family by the time I left there. Do yourself a favor and stop in here for some amazing service and super yum food. Oh and there\u2019s a parking lot just about a block away and pretty easy street parking available as well.",

Mary and Dan have set up this nook on Lake Street (one of their three establishments), that was filled with warmth and Asian hospitality, and delicious food with distinctive Asian flavors.  Tasty, flavorful, and light \u2013 what more could you ask for?  Aaaaah - a selection of adult beverages, you ask?  Yes, a menu full of those as well \u2013 in addition to authentic Asian drinks and cocktails.  The Spring Rolls were heavenly, with or without the sauce \u2013 so much so, that we ordered a second helping (yeah, that good, really!!!).  We tried two Baos \u2013 with turmeric-infused curry chicken (halal, of course), and barbecued Jackfruit.  I grew up eating jackfruit as a fruit \u2013 couldn\u2019t ever imagine a barbecued jackfruit could taste this goooood!!!  Dan explained to us that he had some specials that evening, and inquired if we were in an adventurous mood.  Our daughter and I were, my wife stayed the normal course.  She tried the Pad See Ew with Tofu and extra spices.  She was delighted with the taste.  We ordered the seared Branzino (fish), flavored with Turmeric and Dill.  The light sauce that came on the dish mixed well with white rice.  I tried the Bo Luc Lac \u2013 the Japanese-style seared Sirloins with Arugula and white rice.  Delicious!!!  We polished off our meal with a serving of bread pudding \u2013 a special family recipe, accompanied by Vietnamese-style, cinnamon whipped cream.  Light, flavorful and compact in sweetness!!  Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better finish to our dinner.  Definitely a place to return to - looking forward to visiting Mary and Dan's restaurant on Lake Street, during our next visit to Chicago.",

We ordered Fried chicken buns and pho (my friend ordered Fried noodles). The Fried chicken bag is really delicious! The chicken is juicy and oily. The bag is very soft and sweet. The taste is sour and sweet with a spicy taste. I highly recommend this! It's the weekend limit. The Fried noodles are as delicious as my hometown. The soup of the river noodles has a strong gravy taste and a lingering aftertaste. The noodles are soft and smooth. We also ordered Thai iced tea and sparkling water. Iced tea is smooth and sweet, with a strong tea aroma. The sparkling water has the aroma of wine. This place is awesome! So I have a happy weekend, I believe I will come to the weekend! Very authentic Asian food (also the best Asian food I've ever eaten in America, and they're not expensive!)",

We were disappointed with the food and the service, however it was the food that has deterred future visits. Their Restaurant Week prix fixe menu offers an appetizer, entree and dessert for $36 with an optional coursed wine pairing for $22. We chose to do both and ended up with a $130 bill that was not at all worth it. The fried dumplings with jackfruit were tasty, but there were only 4 of them. I don't know if they adjusted the portions for Restaurant Week or if that's standard, but it was a small app. The veggie spring roll appetizer I'd advise against, it's boring and generic, as is the sweet chili sauce that comes with it. For dinner we had a braised catfish dish along with a prawn curry, both were good, however he catfish was very salty and tasted like a heavy hand of soy sauce. For dessert we chose the fried bao and the bread pudding, both served with a coffee caramel. The fried bao was not on their original Restaurant Week menu, it replaced a rice pudding dish and, in hindsight, I would have preferred the rice pudding and the flan that was also available. The fried bao dish was clearly a way to avoid waste. It was a poorly conceptualized dessert. They were \"tossed\" in cinnamon sugar which barely coated them and definitely didn't add flavor. The bread pudding was cut into pieces and was also fried.... Bread pudding should not be fried. In addition to the coffee caramel, it came with a side of cinnamon whipped cream that was terrible. There was so much cinnamon in it that you could feel the granules and taste the rawness of the spice. We left over half of the desserts on their plates and our server didn't ask if anything was wrong, which was a bummer. I mean, he was barely present throughout our meal (or the meal of the couple next to us) so we were not shocked by his lack of attention to detail. Perhaps the most frustrating part is had we ordered all of these things individually we would have spent less money, which is not how Restaurant Week should work, and makes me feel like their Restaurant Week menu is a trap. So if you go there, just order off of their regular menu. We had such high expectations and such a disappointing experience.",

We came on a weeknight and had no wait at all.  We got the shrimp and pork spring rolls, beef pho, and pork belly rice bowl. The spring roll wrapper didn't taste that fresh and was dried up in places, but the fillings and peanut sauce were good. Pho wasn't as good as ones up in Argyle, but the rice noodles were chewy, the broth tasted fresh and clean, and the meat was very tender! The pork belly in the rice bowl was really good, but the bowl was lacking veggies. I felt like the portions would be perfect for lunch, but a felt just a bit lacking for dinner.  Service was very attentive and pleasant, and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  I probably won't come back for dinner, but I'd happily step in for lunch on any day.",

The flavor was rich and and they made it extra spicy for me. There were way more chunks of chicken and vegetables that you would normally get anywhere else. Then I had the iced coffee flan for dessert and it was very good. I'll definitely remember this place whenever I'm in the West loop.",

The quaint yet vibey location in west loop had a great atmosphere. We started off with: Thai iced tea An organic traditional kombucha drink A Thai coffee Food: Stiffed baos ( a steamed Vietnamese fluffy yet spongey bread)....kinda like an English muffin consistency. Three different baos stuffed with caramelized chicken, Hoisin glazed pork belly ( my favorite) and a Wagyu beef...all topped with pickled daikon and carrots, cilantro and jalape\u00f1os, great little snacks packed with flavors and freshness! We also tried the spring rolls...I wasn\u2019t a fan as they weren\u2019t the deep fried variety\ud83d\ude48but the cold summer roll types with the soft rice wrapper.... but it came with an amazing sauce which we asked for a refill of and dipped our bao into \ud83d\ude00 Mains: ca ri ga chicken curry And their Tuesday special: fried rice.  With the toasted sesame seeds, chilis, spring onions and depths of flavours\u2026.Absolutely delish!! The flavors were bold and authentic ( from our other Vietnamese dining experience) but no other Vietnamese restaurant I\u2019ve been to so far was as bold and flavorful. The owners husband came around and had we had a great convo. Amazing customer service. Would love to come back and try more of their menu. You gotta eat here!",

We walked about 15 minutes from Sky Deck, it's on Lake street and Clinton.  I ordered the veggie Pho which Dan the owner allowed me to order a small since I also wanted to order the Branzini whole fried and deliciously marinated fish.  The veggie Pho came with 4 large pieces of seasoned tofu.  My boyfriend ordered Bun Bo Hue which was spicey with meats and very tasty too.  We also ordered a pot of Green tea to add more healing powers along with coconut flan.  Everything was delectable!!!   So happy we went here.  Also the young lady was so nice to keep checking on us with our lemon waters and refilling our hot tea.  And the young fellow checked on us repeatedly also, both with warm smiles.   The boss Dan was there and was very sociable with us and a good sales man with the whole Branzini fish that I'm glad I ordered.  Dan told us some sweet history of the Saigon Sisters and engaged fun friendly conversation.  Everyone was awesome, food was off the charts.  We will be back, thank you Saigon Sisters!  And thanks Dan for the warm welcome!  P.S.,the photo of my pho was taken after a few bites.  I still included it.",
