The pic is the Sushi and Sashimi dinner. The best part is that their Chinese menu is just as good as their sushi menu so the rest of my family can  eat too! My daughter loved the Peking Duck and the Mango Chicken. Husband has so far enjoyed the szechuan chicken and the egg rolls. For now we've only had take out, but I'm looking forward to dining in soon one day.",

They also have a lot of good boba options and their lunch combos are good. They also have a diverse menu and are quick to complete your order. The staff is also friendly, there is one lady who always (pre-COVID) offered me a cup of tea and a seat while I waited to pick up my order. I only wish their delivery area was larger. Hopefully after the pandemic I will get to try a drink at the bar.",
