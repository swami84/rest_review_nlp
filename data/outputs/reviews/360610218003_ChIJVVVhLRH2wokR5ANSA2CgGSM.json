My husband ordered the \"House special\" drink and it was excellent, he enjoyed it.  Now to explain the one star.  We waited over an hour and a half for our food, I only ordered two appetizers.  He ordered curry chicken.  We were the only party in the restaurant and the server told us twice that the kitchen was \"backed up\".  We couldn't figure out with who as our party were the only ones there.  When the food finally arrived his plate looked a mess save for the rice and peas which was formed into a circle the chicken and cabbage seemed just kind of tossed onto the plate.  For it to be curry chicken, it really didn't have any sauce, the rice was too moist  and the entire plate was bland.  I ordered cocktail patties and plantains (I must stress I waited an hour and a half for appetizers).  To their credit they seemed house made but they barely had any meat inside and where also bland.  I really wouldn't feel right recommending this place to anyone except for maybe drinks.  Our entire party had similar critiques for the food, it was all bland and \"just ok\".  They definitely have alot of room for improvement.  Go at your own risk",

What I like most about this establishment is the service and the music. They play classic reggae tracks that if you are a fan, you love the atmosphere. The server was also extremely nice and police and that was a big plus for me. We ordered the oxtail and the curry goat. The curry goat was very salty sadly and uneatable., and my brother had the same experience with it when he went before me so that is their main drawback. However, the oxtail was pretty good and I heard their salmon is great as well. However, a bunch of stuff on their menu was not present when we went to dine there, which was a big disappointment because we had to keep switching our order. For the music and ambiance alone, though, I would recommend this place, along with if you order the right item.",
