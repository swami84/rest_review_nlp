DC courts decided that there was an unacceptable RISK for tipped employees if tip pool contributions were based on a percentage of sales. Sales amounts (and tip amounts received) are both outside the control of the employee, so sales percentages are an unreasonable basis for calculations. Many $$ you leave as a tip NEVER goes to the server (or just a small portion does) Many are told they did not get enough sales and thus pay MINIMUM wage instead of actual tips. Total Scam.",

Unis (hopefully I\u2019m spelling this correctly), the manager, is very nice and knowledgeable, and Marcelo, our waiter from Paraguay, was very polite and fun, and made great recommendations from the menu: the crunchy/very tasty arancini and the delicious caprese salad to start, and the oaxtail lasagna as main entree. Amazing, home-made but sophisticated Italian delicacies! We\u2019re definitely coming back to try the fried polenta, steak and gnochi. While this restaurant just opened two months ago, it already has great reviews and there was a long line at 8 pm, so make your reservations in advance. I usually don\u2019t have the time to write restaurant reviews, but this one did it for us. :)",
