I came in when the place was getting ready to close and he still let me grab some food and a drink and we just kind of talked about life and stuff. The place seems like a place to take a date or have a classy dinner with a few colleagues. It's one of those dress up nice type of places but you still don't have to. The lights are low and it's a darker setting. There's a large choice of drinks as well ranging from typical drinks and beer to some different flavored beers to whole bottles of wine.",

We were greeted at the door and then they took our coats for us and sat us in a semi-private area. Our waiter, Peter, was with us shortly and was so enthusiastic. He made you feel like somehow you were taking a journey with the food, which we loved. He was not pushy to hurry us at all, but never made us feel like we were waiting for him. We started our meal with the smoked pork belly appetizer which was delightful. We followed that up with seafood bisque and a wedge salad. Let me tell you\u2014my favorite blue cheese dressing ever! Not too strong, very smooth. The croutons were clearly house-made and very good as well. Then, my husband and I both ordered the ribeye with the upgraded whipped potatoes baked with cheese. So worth the upgrade! (Side note\u2014the menu says no substitutes, but you can sub sides. However, they up-charge these things, which is to be expected at a place like this, but it\u2019s worth mentioning.) One of us had the asparagus and one the mushrooms as our other sides. Both good choices. The steaks were good\u2014but honestly, not a $49 steak. It was tender and very marbled, but it lacked a little in the flavor department. It was cooked to order quite well though. Not over- or under-done. The wine sauce was good, but also not super flavorful or abundant. We finished off with a couple of desserts. Apparently the oatmeal pie with cinnamon gelato is the most popular thing there, so we got that and a chocolate cheesecake. Honestly, these were the least impressive parts. The oatmeal pie was sweet and was fine, but not to mine or hubby\u2019s taste really. The chocolate cheesecake was smooth and also fine, but it wasn\u2019t very chocolatey, and it was clear that the berries came from being frozen\u2014at least that\u2019s how it looked. It seems like a place like this with such high quality food should at least have fresh berries with the cheesecake, not frozen. Call me picky! Anyhow, our overall experience was good and we\u2019ll probably go again. If you plan to experience Joseph\u2019s, make sure you are prepared to pay! The steaks are not priced as they are sold at market value which continually changes. By the time we tipped, the bill was about $200 for 2 of us.",

The portions of food were almost too generous so you may want to split a meal.  I think my wife and I should have done that.  Service was great.  The ambiance of the place is also nice.  They have a bar if you are ready to do that given the covid situation.  Their booths are socially distances and have divider curtains which is a nice touch of separation again given the covid environment we currently are in.  This place is a bit on the pricier side but well worth the money.  I had the Special of the day which was Halibut and it was great.  That's all folks.  Happy Dining.",

We came here to celebrate my sister's graduation from the University of Iowa and luckily we had a reservation (they were also asking for credit cards to hold reservations given how highly-desired this place was for graduation night).  SETTING: Classic steakhouse vibes with a dimly-lit bar, tall/soft chairs, and several people beyond the main waiters running around filling waters and clearing tables. That's what makes me think of a nicer steakhouse.  FOOD: What I love about Joseph's is that you can get high-quality steakhouse food and service at a reasonable price, especially compared to where I'm used to going in Chicago and Boston. The 16 oz. ribeye I ordered was $36 and it could easily have been $60 in the cities I just mentioned.  Our steaks came with a soup or salad so I started with the seafood bisque which was warm and creamy and very flavorful. Can't remember many seafood bisques I've had to compare it to but I liked this soup.  Then came the main event, the ribeye steak. I don't often cook red meat for myself at home so this was a nice treat. It was a boneless ribeye that was cooked to a perfect medium rare and covered in a red wine demi glace. We paired it with the Boursin Whipped potatoes (a MUST GET), the Brussels sprouts and bacon (think shaved Brussels sprouts), and the mushrooms (small mushrooms, not sliced). We got the large versions of each of the sides which were, again, very reasonably priced but they weren't too big. It was perfect for my family of four but if you had more people, I would definitely get two orders of the Boursin Whipped potatoes.  We were too full for a big dessert but my sister really wanted creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e so we got dish of it (only $3!). We all tried a bit and it was some of the best I've had.  If you are in Iowa City and looking for one of the nicest dinners in town, look no further than Joseph's.",

My only complaint is that the table of younger men next to us was extremely loud in an otherwise quiet ambience and the minute we sat next to them, I heard them LOUDLY discussing and laughing about how a young child was murdered (in detail) in some movie they were talking about. As a mother of 4, (and 1 stillborn) this was an awful conversation to hear (especially when they are so loud that you can't ignore them) on your birthday. I didn't want to be \"that person\" so I did my best to block their noise out. Aside from that, great great GREAT food and service.",

They weren't busy; we got there right when they opened & were the only people there, so there's no excuse for our experience:  I had the seafood bisque, which was underseasoned & too acidic. (I added butter & salt, which made it better.) My scallop meal was OVERseasoned, with only 3 scallops. My potato risotto was so raw that it crunched.  To add insult to injury, the prices on the bill were slightly higher than those on the menu--the martini was $2 more, and so were my scallops. If it had been a $35 meal instead of a $75 meal (actually, my husband only had an appetizer), I wouldn't be mad, but at these prices, we won't be going back.",

The onion rings alone were flavor packed so they definitely give quality cuisine attention to each meal they create!",

Everything is simple and easy to process, which is further helped by the in-depth reccomendations the water/waitress can give. The food is great.

Everyone else I ate with seemed to thouroughly enjoy their food and I plan to come here every once in a while. The price of everything is quite high and the entrance is somewhat unappealing, but everything else this restaurant has completely overshadows the negatives.  TL;DR: amazing atmosphere, simplicity, food, and service, but expensive.",

This restaurant is one of those \"emperor's new clothes\" situations where the management hopes to god that the menu's pricing will convince customers that the food served is high-end and delicious. Absolutely overpriced on all counts. Beautiful atmosphere and okay service but the food was really poorly made and tasted awful. I am very surprised at the stellar ratings this restaurant has online considering I have lived in Iowa City for years and every one of my colleagues and professors has said this restaurant should be avoided. If you want class and delicious food at a similar price point I would strongly encourage you to look into Orchard Green, an absolute gem, not only of Iowa City but restaurants in the midwest.",

We had always heard vastly differing views of the restaurant service, food, and prices that ultimately made us not too keen on going. However, on one fateful afternoon I decided to make a reservation (side note, if you want to eat here make sure to make a reservation at least 1 week in advance. Also if you choose an earlier dinner time the wait time is next to zero and by the time the restaurant fills you're then eating), and it was a great decision to go. The food was cooked perfectly and was seasoned to perfection. The drinks were unique and out of this world and every aspect of the experience was amazing for us, it is a pricey place, but honestly worth every cent. We will be coming back and it may be our new special night out place",

Ordered the wedge salad - how do you go wrong with a wedge?  Delish.   Skipped the appetizer and went straight for an entree.  I ordered the surf and turf and it was amazing.  The filet mignon was like slicing into butter - a little bit of heaven.  The lobster was deliciously prepared - dipped in butter - amazing.  Just the right potion size!!!!  Topped it all off with an amazing blackberry lemon drop - So delicious - completely relaxing.  Recommend this place highly!!",

We spent over $600 and they couldn't wait for us to sign our credit card statements (waiting on them to do so) and asked us to move?? Why don't you just bring us our cards back faster and we'd be gone? When we asked to talk to the (same) manager about our upsetting experience, she defended her request for us (6 people) to move to the bar for 30 seconds while we waited for our cards to be returned. I guess I expected better service from a steakhouse. Won't be back.",

One of our colleagues had the ribeye and he said it was one of the best ribeye he's ever had. He requested it cooked medium rare.  The restaurant was nice clean. Wait staff was attentive. Great customer service. Would visit and dine again.  All-in-all a wonderful and excellent experience.",

        "caption": "Our family of four went to celebrate our college son's birthday as it seemed to be one of the few places in IC where we could get seafood. The decor is weirdly fancy with curtained off areas for tables. The server was very friendly and helpful although the main issue we had (the pricing) was not something she could help us with. Entrees are all over $25 and most are at least $5 or $6 more than that. Very little is included with the entree although my steak did come with a generous, but uninteresting salad. Sides began at $6. My son ordered the sea bass and much to our dismay, immediately after ordering it, we overheard the party at the next table complaining about that same dish! He dismissed them as he is an adventurous eater, but found the meal not to his liking either as it was smothered in an ill-chosen Amaretto sauce. My husband's halibut (the special) was edible, but also overpriced. My own choice, a ribeye, rang in at $31 and was no better than one I have made at home for much less money (and I am no great cook.) My husband and son did enjoy the lobster bisque, but that was the highlight. The rest was just nothing special and certainly did not warrant the high pricing in a college town. My younger son was not feeling great so just had fries and pronounced them to be delicious. So, hey! The fries are good! We wish we had checked an online menu beforehand so we would have known what we were getting into. No bang for your buck at this place!",
