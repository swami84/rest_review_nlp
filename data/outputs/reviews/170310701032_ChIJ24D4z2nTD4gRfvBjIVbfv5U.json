Granted, I was the only customer in there at the time due to weather, but the counter guy couldn't have been more personable and the grilled cheese (a bit of an understatement, as it has sauteed spinach and carmelized onions along for the ride) and rosemary fries were great as was the store-made lemonade. A bit pricy - no boutique sandwich shop isn't - but completely worth the money for quality American comfort food. They also have adult beverages ranging from beer to shots as well.",

Thick slices of yummy corned beef covered with spicy sauce made for a decadent treat. The chicken sandwich was made of 5 breaded chicken tenders tossed in buffalo sauce, with blue cheese and a celery slaw salad. Both sandwiches were huge and filling, maybe even a little unwieldy because of their size.  We also had fries with truffle sauce to top it off. The fries are well fried and tasty. The truffle sauce is sinful and too easy eat!  They also serve alcohol, but we didn't try any. The place is clean and well designed. The music was great, while we ate at some point the song, There is a Light that Never Goes Out by the Smiths. That was nice.",
