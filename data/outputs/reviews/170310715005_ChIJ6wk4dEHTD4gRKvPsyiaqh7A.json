        "caption": "Real Good has so many tasty food options! I LOVE the vegan chocolate chip cookies, the breakfast burritos and the overnight oats (which they sadly don't sell anymore). The reason for two stars is because I've encountered a staff member (woman with red hair) on a few occasions who has been short with me and I'm not sure why. I'm not a sensitive person but I can pick up on nasty attitudes pretty quickly.  I normally would get something from them in the mornings because I work in the area. I've watched how this employee kindly address other people in line before me yet be short with me. In addition to that, there was a time when I was getting the overnight oats pretty regularly. Other employees (who have been incredibly nice and helpful) would offer fruit and granola and it was the same price every time. One day I ordered the overnight oats from this rude person, ordered it the same way, and she charged me an extra dollar for granola. I told her that I hadn't paid for extra granola in the past. Her snippy response was \"well they should've been charging you.\"  Another time, I was asking about hot food items with the dumb assumption that she would apply good customer service and assist me with some options. Nope. Instead she turned her back to me and started working on something else and I was left awkwardly standing there to just figure it out on my own.  I've noticed that I get anxious about going into Real Good because I don't want to deal with this person. So I don't bother going there anymore. She's either overworked or misplacing her frustrations or she's just a genuinely nasty person. I'm not spending anymore of my hard earned money at this location.  And just to reiterate, I've encountered other employees there who have been so kind, helpful, and nice to talk to. I'm not 100% familiar with the items they offer. So helpful, kind employees do go a long way.",

A girl named Lily made the best smoothies and bowls for me every morning. I had a great experience daily. However, after she left I noticed the management changed.I\u2019ve had one to  many terrible experiences ever since. I\u2019ve gotten SICK from their smoothies and juices constantly.The management is poor. I have traveled to Old town, Lakeview and Southport. Completely disappointed.Streeterville is the closest to my condo. After all this time I find out that They\u2019re NON-ORGANIC after being lied to by Real good staff and I\u2019m taking this up with Whole Foods! The staff is UNSANITARY also highly unprofessional. Total disappointment. I have spent so much money at real good and officially will never return! Officially giving that new Goddess place a chance. Disappointed!",
