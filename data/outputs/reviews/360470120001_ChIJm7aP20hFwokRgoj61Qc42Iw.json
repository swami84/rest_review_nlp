My husband said that my stomach hurts when I got home. It didn\u2019t take long for me to get back to my stomach. I had a diarrhea yesterday, I am still diarrhea, and the front desk service is not. Well, the tip also asks people to take things. I won\u2019t go to this house next time and spend money without saying that I still have bad stomach. \ud83d\udc4e  (Original) \u4e0d\u597d\u670d\u52a1\u6001\u5ea6\u4e5f\u4e0d\u597d\uff0c\u6628\u5929\u8ddf\u5bb6\u4eba\u53bb\u5403\uff0c\u5f88\u5bf9\u6d77\u9c9c\u4e0d\u65b0\u9c9c\uff0c\u56de\u5bb6\u8def\u4e0a\u6211\u8001\u516c\u8bf4\u809a\u5b50\u75db\uff0c\u56de\u5230\u5bb6\u6ca1\u591a\u4e45\u6211\u809a\u5b50\u4e5f\u75db\uff0c\u6628\u5929\u62c9\u809a\u5b50\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u8fd8\u5728\u62c9\u809a\u5b50\uff0c\u524d\u53f0\u670d\u52a1\u4e5f\u4e0d\u597d\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\uff0c\u5c0f\u8d39\u8fd8\u8981\u6c42\u522b\u4eba\u62ff\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u6211\u4e0b\u6b21\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53bb\u8fd9\u5bb6\u5403\u4e86\u82b1\u4e86\u94b1\u4e0d\u8bf4\u8fd8\u5403\u574f\u809a\u5b50\u3002\ud83d\udc4e",

Other than that the non seafood items are limited. Overall the seafood was good. We ordered crabs, crab legs, giant prawns, oysters, small live shrimps, razor clams and etc. They have a small selection of quick bites (fish ball, wood ear fungus, ramen, straw mushrooms, sausages and 2 flavors of the same pastry) on the revolving belt. Overall the food is good but the seating layout and table is very cramped. I'm not a big person but I was trying not to knock down anything from the table. With 4 personal hotpots, a seafood platter and few plates here and there the table is already full. The hotpot is so close to you that you'll get a hotpot facial. The edge of the hotpot is just 2.5 inches from end of the table.  The table next to us ordered oysters and found a worm in one of it. The manager took the plate of oysters back without hesitation and asked them if they wanted another order - they declined. I would too, if I found a worm. Other than a worm in a oyster the small table the place is not bad.",

Is a cool thing at a restaurant bcuz not many hot pot places have this. This is an AYCE place but portions are small which are understandable. Minus 2stars because the soup base is not enough flavor and the food are not that fresh. Like fish fillet usually takes 30 seconds to cook.

The picture feels good. So I had dinner with my family on Saturday night and enjoyed the seafood buffet. After trying it, I thought I would not go there for the second time, because the sea clams are all sand, the Argentine prawn meat is very bad, and the crab legs are not dripping. It seems that the salmon meat has been kept for several days. Three people went to eat, each time only four or five pieces of each thing, five or six clams, four clams, too tired to eat and add. Finally orange juice, with foam on top and transparent water below, shouldn't it be yellow? A dozen dollars in a bundle! Didn't eat the sea urchin, crab, fish fillet, and the ten-second beef tongue mentioned on the Internet. Does the boss need a special order? Merchants say that their personal tastes are different, but it is true, but the amount of your shop for the first time is very small. The next time it is, every time, I am afraid that people will eat too much. Please let me try a second time, I am not interested!

A moving conveyor belt, not with sushi, but with plates of hot pot items!  AYCE for a great low price ($19.99 a person). The belt is never empty and around and around comes the little portions of fishballs and other staples. I've tried at least 3 of their soup bases, all of which rich in flavor. My favorite? Tomato. Pots were constantly refilled and skimmed.  The atmosphere is nice, lighting wasn't too dark. Decor looks trendy with a hint of British accents. Though, I felt cramped when it came to seating wise. No where to hang coats and bags, couldn't even do that behind my chair since they're rounded.  This place has quickly become our new favorite in the neighborhood.",

Compared to many other places in Chinatown, Hometown felt pretty clean and welcoming to first timers. The menu definitely had some terrifying items, but wasn't too intimidating. They also had great options for vegetarians, as long as you each have your own pot.  The decor and vibes were pretty cool, young and hipster.  Would definitely go back!",
