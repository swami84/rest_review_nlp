When I made this suggestion to the staff not only did they not know what bubble tea is but seems to be sarcastic in there reply when I suggested to mention this to the owner. Typically bubble tea cost $5.00 dollars and the mark up is over 100% so why would you not offer this? I ordered double tuna which the cashier charged me for two bowels vs. adding $7.00 dollars as an example for extra tuna. Why would you not offer this option in your POS system. I run my own business down the street, not a very good first impression. (new) please see chase card from snip tool showing I was charged 20.28, no drink, so not sure how this is a fair price to add (1) scope of tuna but ok. While I realize this is Hawaiian style one would come to know that poke bowl originated in Japan not Hawaii and while bubble tea was originated in Taiwan it was adopted in Hawaii, Asia, Europe and US main land. Cost is minimal to add revenue and might rethink your position on not offering this as I know many other poke bowl restaurants bubble tea. Doesn't hurt to offer something that customers like and adds value.",

I love that you can choose one of their bowls already made up for you or create your own or even make anything into a sushi burrito----the possibilities are endless here! The staff was also incredibly happy, enthusiastic & helpful which was a huge plus for me since their attitude made me want to return soon!

In addition to white rice and brown rice, the base also has a choice of buckwheat, white broccoli and lettuce.  The protein has the choice of spicy squid, squid, shrimp, tofu or chicken. The size of the bowl in a bowl can be chosen in two flavors. If you want to eat two servings in one flavor.  There are more choices for ingredients, and there is no need to increase the price of the whole meal. The price increase in the toppings is avocado ($1.50) or seaweed ($1), and the eggs are no longer added.  Finally, there are fried onions, garlic, tempura powder and so on.  There are up to 10 flavors of sauces, and you like Yuzu's taste of light grapefruit, but with a touch of spicy.  It is highly recommended that the Poke Bowl restaurant in Miami has a price of $12.5 in a bowl and $17.5 in a large bowl. In general, the bowl can be full.
