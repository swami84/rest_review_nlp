It is a humongous juicy fish ball shaped like a lion's mane with savory sauce served on a perfectly crisp bed of greens.  Healthy and delicious.  You need to try this.  They also have some of the best dan tat or egg tarts around.  The owners a friendly and make you feel like one of the family.  Also tried any of their stir fried dishes especially noodles.  They have super high BTU woks in the back that literally look like a dragon breathing fire. Anyone who knows good Chinese food knows this is critical to properly prepared stir fry dishes.",

We did not have a large order, however the staff forgot to bring our rice and neglected to bring the waters we had asked for. While dining, my fiance had to get our saucers and take out boxes. They made haste in tallying up our bill. The staff continued to stand over my shoulder as I counted my cash, then as I searched for my debit card and parking ticket. Upon return, the staff still hovered waiting to see the tip amount. I intended not to leave any tip, as my fiance provided all service besides bringing the food and processing my card. I was stopped by the staff immediately after standing. The staff member was calling me to turn around and shouted in a rude manner, \"Hey, hey! You must leave a table tip!\" I threw a single folded dollar on the table and proceeded to walk out. The staff member unfolded the bill, scowling at us as we exited the restaurant.",

The clerk insisted that neither Chinese nor English could be used, and gave me a menu of photos. As it was a photograph, something different from what I thought came out, but everything was delicious. Chinese tea comes out with a big teapot. A regular clerk took the egg tart near the entrance by the customer himself, and the clerk checked the order table. If you don't ask for vinegar, you can not bring it. It is necessary to ask the person in the shop to take care of the person who has a fugitive or do not go to the room with the key. It is near from Izumo Taisha bus platform. There are a lot of vagrants and uncles who are doing gambling along the riverside, so be careful as the security seems to be bad.

There are better quality restaurants for the same price in the same Cultural Plaza. 3.

The dim sum is always hot and fresh and I haven't been disappointed by anything on the menu.  Ordering is easy for customers like me who don't speak Chinese with the favorites shown on a picture menu. I mainly order by pointing at the picture to make sure I get the right food, which I've had an issue with at some other dim sum restaurants. Whatever makes ordering easier, I'm down!  My favorite is the shrimp look fun. The sauce is delicious and it always comes out fresh and hot. I love egg tarts and I love that they have it on their menu! If it's in the display case, you can take it to your table. They were all out when we got there, but we were able to get fresh egg tarts. Delicious!  My family and I will continue to eat dim sum here for a long time!",

Most patrons appeared to be locals or workers wanting a speedy in-and-out lunch. How they did so with the inattentive, haphazard service surprises me.  We were seated immediately, but after waiting almost 10 min for a server it took several attempts to flag one down (a male Cashier/? manager saw me gesture that we were ready to order, but ignored me). Couldn't wash up before eating because staff was not too busy to provide restroom (which was clean, but outside and about 30 yards away) key. Multiple requests were needed for a tea refill and water.  This is par for this type of place and is readily forgivable if the food is good. It wasn't. BBQ pork buns were cold; siu mai and har gow were lukewarm at best. And, STALE! With the exception of two non-menu items we requested specially, nothing we ordered appeared or tasted fresh. No wonder - most of the dim sum dishes were kept at a bare side table by the kitchen without even heat lamps or steam warmers.  To top it off, the check for four was nearly $60, not including the undeserved tip. I know things are more expensive here than on the Mainland, but I've had fine, fresh dim sum at many similar neighborhood places for $10-$12/person in San Francisco and NYC.  Overall, a major disappointment. I'd recommend giving it a miss.",
