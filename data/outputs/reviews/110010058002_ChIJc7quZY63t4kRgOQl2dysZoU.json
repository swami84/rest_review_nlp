Once I ordered a fried fish dish expecting a good-sized filet, as I have experienced at other Thai places, and the dish had a pile of tiny pieces of fish surrounded by a lot of crunchy batter.  I basically \"shelled\" the fish from the batter to eat it. On a positive note, the roast duck curry is good.",

This place has a nice vibe, seating is a little tight but once you get settled in you feel right at home. Bar appears to be fitted nicely, but we ordered a single tap beer which was served cold. We ordered one basil fried rice with chicken and one basil with chicken and a fried egg. Portions were decent, and the spice levels were spot on (the fried rice was ordered as a 5 out of 10 level and was perfect). The rice used in the fried rice was softer than what I like, which means it was clumpy, where I prefer rice cooked with less water. Service was great, never ran out of water. Everything was clean and had a nice authentic Bangkok decor. Being Thai food snobs we reserve a perfect 5 stars for places that can also cook to authentic Thai tastes. For Farang taste you can\u2019t go wrong here!",

The iced tea is a passion fruit tea and excellent in its unsweetened form, even for someone who grew up drinking sweet tea.  It gets crowded at lunch, but it seems like you can always find a table.  Dinner crowds some on the weekends, but during the week and on Sundays you can get the restaurant with just a few other people at dinner and enjoy a quieter more intimate experience.  This is one of my favorites that is in regular rotation for both personal and work lunches and dinners.",

There is patio seating, bar seating and plenty of tables. One thing odd about the bar is that your knees hit the bar before you can reach the table so that's a bit uncomfortable. Service was excellent and food was great. I ordered the Panang Curry which was very yummy and not too spicy. I'd like a little less peanut flavor in my Panang though. There was no parking, but that's expected with being in downtown. Loved it and will be back again.",

However, on my last visit I found a shrimp shell in my food - not a full, cooked shrimp, but an empty shrimp shell that looked like it had been half eaten or come from somebody's finished plate or something. I was so grossed out. After I called back for a refund, which I got, the person on the other line offered to give me a coupon for my next visit. I didn't take it because I will not be back.

The ambience was nice and the waitstaff was polite, but when my co-worker tried to order a beer, they refused to recognize his Puerto Rican driver's license as a valid form of ID. Then they made the mistake of asking him for his passport to verify his age, because he obviously wasn't a citizen. Last I checked, while not a state, Puerto Rico is definitely part of the United States.  We're both old enough to have seen \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in theatres, and we have enough grey in our hair and our beards - so age verification could not have been an issue. We walked out and found another Thai restaurant down the street that did accept his ID.",

I asked for Thai Spicy. I did not get Thai Spicy but it may be because of my extremely hot palette. The the vegetables were perfect. The noodles were also great. They are the thinner flat noodle versus the thick flat noodle that seem to be very hard to find in the DMV. My beef was good but it did not take much of the flavor from the sauce from the drunken noodle. Some of my pieces were tender while others were tough. The portions were perfect! I don't want the person reading this think that this place is not good because it is. I am giving it three stars because I have had other versions of drunken noodle that I like slightly better. Like I mentioned I love thick noodles. I also have a very spicy and salty palette. Maybe they were light on the dark soy sauce but the sauce seemed to sit in the back ground. I was expecting for it to be more prominent.  Customer Service: I was greeted when I came in. I was sat a table very quickly. My food came out in less than 5 minutes. My water was constantly being refilled. I was in and out very quickly. I was greeted on the way out as well! Customer service here is phenomenal!  I hope to come back and try their other dishes!",

It was a busy Friday night for most of the restaurants on the 6th street. We luckily got a table at here before the whole dining room filled up. All three courses came out of the kitchen in an extremely timely manner. My highlight was the Chicken Pad Thai. My friend really enjoyed the fried tempura ice cream. He forced me to take a few bites because he was really loving it and said he would kick himself, if he ate the whole thing by himself. I have to say that was a great way to end the meal. The Thai Smile Martinis were delicious! I would definitely recommend one of those if you want to try a signature martini. If not, then they have Shock Top, which gets no complaints here!",

My colleague and I came here for dinner during their HH so we ordered the deep fried beef strips and Thai fried chicken for appetizers. The beef was tasty (much better than I-Thai's) but the fried chicken was mediocre at best as it tasted like a normal frozen wings that they deep fried. For dinner I had the duck red curry and my colleague had the shrimp green curry. We asked for a 3/4 spice level and they delivered, quickly too! The food was well seasoned (no MSG, so they're not cheating!) with a generous portion. For the quality of food, portion and price this place easily worth the trip.",

The noodles are better tasting and they put the egg on top of the noodles. Overall a great experience.  The location is a little rundown, but should get better as time goes.",
