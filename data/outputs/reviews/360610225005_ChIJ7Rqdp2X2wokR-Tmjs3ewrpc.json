I\u2019ll start off by speaking very well about the food, as it is important that if you want good Indian food, you should know you won\u2019t be disspaointed. However, our experience here was, by far, the absolute rudest I have ever experienced in the service industry. My friend brought us here for the food, we are not locals and could have gone anywhere. We were seated outside and and our server went through the menu with us very thoroughly. We placed our order; 2 appetizers, 3 alcoholic brevags, and 3 entrees. Our server was very awkward, but friendly. After we got our food he disappeared immediately, we didn\u2019t even get refills on our drinks. After a while, he returns to pick up our table. THIS IS WHERE THINGS TURN...After finishing our food, we saw a sign that mentioned a buffet until 4pm; we ordered our food at 3pm. We mentioned to the server that we wish he would have told us about the buffet as it included free alcoholic drinks and a variety Of options (including someone of the food we ordered). HIS RESPONSE, \u201cwell, why do I have to tell you, there\u2019s a sign, that\u2019s what\u2019s signs are for\u201d We were taken away, as we were not rude, just explaining we wish we would have known. The best part of this is when he goes even further to tell us how amazing the buffet is and that it would have been a better deal, but we should have read the sign. We asked to speak to the owner, who told is THE EXACT SAME THING. For the record, we know very well he wasn\u2019t the owner, but the son of the owner acting as the owner, but we didn\u2019t want to pursue this any further. We paid our bill and left, never coming back. HORRIFIC SERVICE OUTWEIGHS AMAZING FOOD.",

We were a party of 7 (4 adults and 3 kids) and we were  dealing with hungry kids following the end of a graduation ceremony at CCNY.  Once we were seated, we were given water and tamarind juice to refresh our palates and invited to join the buffet and serve ourselves. The buffet had a lot of variety, but not too much to feel overwhelmed, and the food tasted so good.  The ambience in this place is perfect for date night, hanging out with friends or just celebrating. I loved the exposed brick wall and the ceiling within the restaurant. The  customer service was awesome - staff were professional and courteous. I definitely look forward to going back soon!!!",

The food was served fast, hot and most importantly, delicious! The chef came out and asked us how everything was and told us if we needed anything just let him know. The best service I've ever received in NYC.  It's apparent this customer service is consistent, given the amount of repeat customers who were greeted with a warm familiar welcome. Their signature iced tea was delicious and I don't even like iced tea. The chicken samosa and chicken Tikka masala were delectible and my boyfriend loved his curry chicken.  Anil and his wife are wonderful.  Let me not forget how reasonably priced everything was.  $33 for two appetizers and two entrees.  We will definitely be going back and ordering take out.",

The spice level (heat) was there, but the food itself was tasteless, almost as if the food sits there cooked and then you add the spices at the end and off you go. The breads were hot (good), but the Naans, parathas and pooris were all tough and difficult to cut. Not sure why. Chicken tikka dry Shrimp do payyazi was hard to describe -- did not taste fresh Okra -- not what I expected -- was wet not stir or skillet fry saag paneer - very bland = tasteless kobi aloo matar == some peas were like stones - hard partially cooked; cauliflower was there -but very small florets and not much of them chana masaala = ok but not great banana pakora = ended up being left after a bite on almost all plates sahani -- this was a new one for us - had some flavor dal poori - and coconut poori -- were tough but also tasted of either old oil or some oil we are not familiar with  We were excited that there was a new Indian restaurant in our neighborhood, but regret that we will most likely not try it again. It could be that this is just a completely different style of India than we know or expect and that explains why so many people like it.",

This friendly man was very helpful when describing each dish. So lets get started! First, I started with the tandoori chicken wings as my appetizer...they were super yummy...especially with the raita (cucumber/yogurt sauce). Next, I had the chicken tikka masala...this was one of the best I've had. Perfect balance of cream and tomato mix to the sauce and  it wasn't overly spicy, (like other kinds I've had). The chicken was really tender and the rice was seasoned just right. I also had their garlic naan. Words cannot describe how amazing this bread was! It was soft and yet it had a little crunch. Not overly garlicky...and had a sweet taste as well. My taste buds were overwhelmed with all the flavors! Last, I had 2 of their deserts listed. Rasmalai was the first one. I was interested in it because it said it was a cheese ball served with a sweet sauce. The texture was really different...in a good way! The sauce went great with them.  The firni was the last thing I tasted from this excellent restaurant. I'm a big fan of rice pudding and this one was definitely one of my top favorites! The little sprinkle of coconut shavings on top, really pulled it together with the creamy cinnamon flavors.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and service at Clove...I'll definitely go back!!",

Yes yes it does come with a harsh service and 4 things to choose from with naan and samosa, rice.  The service girl in green was having an off day, as the lady next to me said when she saw I got bad service. The green shirt lady sever jumped in front of me when I'm getting food, then she looked at me and said: \"oh you want this?? Fine, you go.\" I was like, well, I have been in line getting food, but thank you for your generosity to let me get food I'm paying for.  Then 10 minutes later (I usually take my time at buffet to enjoy food and peace) she came to my table and take the white water bottle and slammed it back down, I'm not sure if she was just checking to see if the bottle is empty, it's clear glass bottle so there is more than half water left, maybe water is hard to see... And before that, about my first plate, she came with a check slammed on my table, slammed the salt and pepper down to hold the check.... I started to think maybe this is just how she does things. So I laughed off and move on.  Food: it is not that great. I am in computer science field so yes I know how to judge Indians food since most of my friends are Indians. This is not what good food taste like, chicken was extremely dry wth sauce, shrimp is shrunk to the smallest and sauce is not creamy and tasty as regular paneer.  Samosa is ok, super small with little filling.  Ok I'm done complaining  lol anyway, I'm sad that I was fooled but oh well, NYC, I'm experiencing it.  The clear glass bottle ... But the server can't see water in it so slamming it down the table helped her know \ud83d\ude02slamming table is the new norm in service here \ud83d\ude3b",

After looking though the many of options (which is always a great thing) I finally order the samosas, nan, and lamb vindaloo.  The food came out very quick and was very good.  The green basil sauce on the table was very good and was a great compliment to my meal.  At first I was worry from the food portion that it was not going to be enough, but i was over stuff by time I left... And trust I'm a big boy.  One of the staff members heard me over talking about how I like really spicy food .. It turned out to be the owner who then went to the back and brought me out some home made hotsauce.  It  was spicier than average hot sauce but not really hot like I am use to having from Indian resturants.  However he did inform me that he had to cool it down as many guest could not enjoy the level of spice it was once at.  It was awesome to see a owner who was still able to be down to earth and still able to serve food and make time to talk to guest.  Will I be there again??? yes!!! It's a great edition to Harlem and the food was great.  Be sure to ask for the home made house sauce if you dare \ud83d\udc40",

It's supposed to be creamy, but there was no cream in it whatsoever. Also, I don't think the chef has any idea whatsoever how to make the dish. I'm never going back again. Really bad quality of Indian food! I'm Indian and I've never had so bad food before. What a waste of my $18! I ordered garlic naan as well, which was okay.
