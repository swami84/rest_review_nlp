I asked my nail technician to order a toast for me through the phone, the owner of the place said she can't do it, and that she have to order for at least $35. After my nail technician told the lady that they've been delivering food to a salon for a long period of time for smaller amounts the owner said: \"okay, you can order for $25\". I tried to place an order through their website (which doesn\u2019t say anything about minimum order amount), I received a call from the place saying that I can't order, and \"it is not financially profitable for them to deliver this sandwich\". My nail technician and I have already received numerous phone calls from the place asking to remove this review in exchange for a free sandwich! As business owners you should be client oriented, and if it's not profitable for you just close your place. Put a banner on your website about $35 minimum order amount or kindly ask to order your food through Seamless (and yes, the sandwich there costs $2 more, but they also have $4 promo, which makes it even cheaper).",
