We went here for a Friday night dinner and were two of the only people in the restaurant-which usually would have been a red flag! Except the reviews were so good, we decided to risk it. Had french onion soup to start - it was decent except the cheese had only been set on top and not broiled into a bubbly, cheesy, melty masterpiece. I orderes the pan seared chicken breast, and as soon as it came out I was a little concerned. It was pale white on all sides and didn't look like it had touched a pan at all. It must have been brined for too long because it was so saltly it was inedible, even when paired with the flavorless mashed potatoes. I overheard the only other table mention they had a similar issue. When we mentioned this to the waitress, she offered a complimentary dessert, which I declined on account of still needing a dinner. But we paid full price for our meal, starter, and drinks. My husband's burger was fine - nothing special, nothing bad either.",

The BBQ Shrimp was ok, but I asked for a medium rare filet ($36) and not once but twice was brought something that was well done. Instead of wiping it from my bill though I was brought a free appetizer that I didn't ask for (ironically, the friend green tomatoes were good). Nice gesture, but not the right resolution. The most surprising part was that the restaurant was almost empty. How do you overcook a steak twice when you aren't even busy?",

When I looked at my Groupons this week I realized it was going to expire soon if I didn't use it ASAP. So I came up with an idea because I knew I probably wouldn't make it down there in time. Valentine's day was approaching (today) and I was fully prepared to be sad especially coming out of a good relationship a few months back. So I decided to post on my Facebook looking for a couple who wanted to use my Groupon for Valentine's day free of charge...I even offered to babysit for free. I figured helping to make someone else's Valentine's day special would help me not focus so much on being single. So. Guess it sorta was a selffish thing really. Well none of my Facebook friends asked about it so I decided to post it ok a public Facebook group for people in the area. I got a lot of messages then but 1 stood out the most it was a family that had a rough year and I just instantly knew it was this family I wanted to give it to. Buy in order for all this to happen I had to contact the restaurants amazing and kind manager Damian to go over Logistics about how we could make sure the Groupon would be redeemed so It couldn't be used again. I also wanted to pay extra so some alcohol and dessert for the family. Damian was just so professional and kind. He assured me that he would make this family's Valentine's day dinner special and he did! They sent me pictures after and they had such a great experience. it's 1 thing to have good food it's another to have good service and people that care! Thank you to the entire staff for making a memorable experience for this family. I can't wait to take my friends there for brunch!",
