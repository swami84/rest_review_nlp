The restaurant was purposefully decorated with outer space and movie themed memorabilia, and even the music was space themed!  The food was divine.  The explanations and the connections to the Star Wars canon made the whole evening fun.  My wife has grown tired of my pure excitement since Rise of Skywalker was released, but even she appreciated the fresh look at the stories.  Your team is incredibly talented and courteous.  Chef Regan made sure we had enough paired drinks so that we could fully enjoy the menu as she intended.  This was our first time doing a non-alcoholic pairing, and it was truly a home-run.  Thank you for a wonderful evening.",

Regan is self taught chef (She holds a degree in Fiction Writing) but has worked at some of the best restaurants in Chicago, including Alina. Elizabeth is a single small rectangular room with seating for about 20 people and a completely open kitchen as part of the dining room. This creates an almost too intimate setting - one almost doesn't want to talk too loud so as to not disturb the chefs. Making up for most of this awkwardness is the service staff, who were kind, knowledgeable and very personable.",

Since the menu changes often all I can say is the food is  interesting, flavorful and very we prepared. If you can and it's your thing, definitely sit at a table by the kitchen. Watching food being prepared really heightened the fun of it for us. Wine pairings were discernably sensible for two people with no knowledge of wine. On the night we went each staff member brought out a dish and described it - it was really neat to kind of meet each person. A few notes. First: yes they are happy to accept tips. Not super clear for this kind of place. If you're a ticketed reservation novice like us there's the answer for this place. Second it was not clear coffee was not included in the price... A little annoying to get a bill for coffee but not really a big deal. Last there's no apparent dress code. Showed up in Friday work business casual with a backpack and no issues. Totally recommend overall.",

Keeping its Michelin star since 2014, the restaurant offers a seasonal tasting menu with the best of American food (forget about junkie food, we are talking about real food). When you arrive, the fa\u00e7ade can even scare you a little and it is difficult to see it written in the door in small letters \"Elizabeth\". The environment is a delight and consists of only 9 tables where you can see the intense activity of a silent kitchen in which the smell of the dishes being prepared with so many herbs and spices makes the restaurant have a friendly home atmosphere.  The menu costs USD 80.00 and is already paid at the time of booking, which can be done online without any problem. After the experience they send you the menu you tasted to find out exactly what each dish was. The space is an excellent option for vegetarians, but it also offers some meat dishes. The dishes may seem simple, but they are super elaborated to bring the basic ingredients to life.  The size of the portions is deceiving and you definitely won't go hungry, not least because I don't know if I was lucky, but in my case they offered some extra blacks as a courtesy, making my experience at Elizabeth even better! :)  The fact is: once in Chicago, schedule to go to Elizabeth! You will not regret!  (Original) Valorizar cada um dos ingredientes que vai para o prato \u00e9 a proposta do maravilhoso restaurante da chef Iliana Regan! Mantendo sua estrela Michelin desde 2014 o restaurante oferece um menu degusta\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal com o melhor da comida americana (esque\u00e7a o junkie food, estamos falando de comida de verdade). Ao chegar, a fachada pode at\u00e9 te assustar um pouco e \u00e9 dif\u00edcil de ver escrito na porta em letras min\u00fasculas \u201cElizabeth\u201d. O ambiente \u00e9 uma delicia e est\u00e1 composto de apenas 9 mesas de onde se pode ver a atividade intensa de uma cozinha silenciosa na qual o cheiro dos pratos sendo preparados com tantas ervas e temperos faz o restaurante ter um clima de casa de amigo.

O espa\u00e7o \u00e9 uma excelente op\u00e7\u00e3o pata vegetarianos, mas tamb\u00e9m oferece alguns pratos com carne. Os pratos podem parecer simples, mas s\u00e3o super elaborados para dar vida aos ingredientes b\u00e1sicos.  O tamanho das por\u00e7\u00f5es engana e definitivamente voc\u00ea n\u00e3o sair\u00e1 com fome, at\u00e9 porque n\u00e3o sei se tive sorte, mas no meu caso ofereceram alguns pretos extras como cortesia, deixando a minha experi\u00eancia no Elizabeth ainda melhor! :)  O fato \u00e9: uma vez em Chicago, se programe para ir ao Elizabeth!

The prefix of two favorite discs, the Game of Thrones, The Chronicles of Narnia, and so on. E. In the current theme is a restaurant, close to food, so we can communicate with you along with people. This restaurant is very small but very nice. Just like a porcelain doll's dreams. I really like chef Ana Reagan here to do things. I am pleased to have decided to store the Lincoln field.

The food is outstanding, but especially the beer/wine pairing is fantastic - we had both and I was amazed how often the beer had the same character as the wine, and fit the food perfectly. The wine was more whites, but also a bit of red, champagne and even a sparkling rose that was outstanding. Their cocktail selection of a few interpretations of classics is astonishing. The Downton Abbey had more seafood than I understand is typically their thing (and not mine), but I ate everything, even the salmon, which is a huge testament to how good it was.",

To borrow heavily from my dining companion's words: I could go on and on about all the reasons why I love this place. The food is always delicious. The energy is unpretentious but still at a level of class that is so dignified. It's clear that Iliana Regan is not only a stellar chef but a humble leader who empowers those around her. She is a genuinely good person who has never lost her passion for food, sees the raw power in bringing people together over a meal and who has a team around her that embodies all the values she demonstrates. During brunch a week back Iliana took time out from the open air kitchen to greet guests.  Her team never left our coffee mugs cold, and graciously fielded question after question about the delights we were eating, being so patient with our child like wonder. Last night's menu was created by one of the chefs on Regan's team; highlighting Southeast Asian street food and inspired by his year spent living in a rural town outside of Laos. The flavors were bold, pungent and spicy. His food was the star of the night. liana washed dishes! One of the FOH staff shared stories about her kids. Tonya ran outside, into the frigid cold, to make sure we didn't forget a mini to-go bag...it was perfect. Thank you for reminding us that there is a community of people who stand for something with no compromises in execution of their art.",

The dishes are a parade of eye-candy that display intelligence, whimsy, and a deep understanding of ingredients and their terrior.  The dishes are not merely beautiful, they are deeply satisfying. I\u2019ve had the most sumptuous slices of waygu at Elizabeth. One course was comprised of a pear-sized whole deep fried Hen of the Woods mushroom that I cut apart with a steak knife and of which I savored every bite. It was the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever eaten.  Chef Iliana Regan plays with contrasting temperatures in the most wonderful way. She also includes seemingly bizarre elements from nature, like Spruce tips and edible moss, the pickled roots of cattails, or tender legs of frogs she captured herself (fresh!). These wild items are not gimmicks. Rather, they pack powerful flavor and excitement. I requested seconds on a Spruce tip soda. Seriously, where has Spruce been all my life? The flavor is amazing!  One especially nice new opportunity at Elizabeth Restaurant is the truly excellent brunches and Casual Sunday dinners that one can find tickets for on the restaurant\u2019s web site. These wonderful meal options make Chef Regan\u2019s wonderful vibe and brilliant cooking accessible to a broader (largely blue jean-wearing) clientele. Those seeking fancy food should stick to Elizabeth Restaurant\u2019s dinner series. Brunch won\u2019t feature uni and foam, but it does sometimes feature wonderful, seasonal wild mushrooms, the chef\u2019s award-worthy bread, house made preserves, magically delicious eggs, house made bacon and other treats, my favorite of which are the Bunny the Bakery whisky-glazed donuts. Best donuts ever!  I particularly love the service at Elizabeth. The entire staff seems to emit a peaceful, bright, engaging resonance and operate from a sophisticated awareness of how to set the tone for each interaction.  This incredible restaurant and its brilliant chef earn my highest recommendation.",

At Elizabeth Restaurant\u2019s \"Downton Abbey\" Dinner Series, the courses themselves are the jewels!  The wine was really flowing when we visited Elizabeth Restaurant for the amazing \"Downton Abbey\" Dinner Series, Servants vs. Aristocrats. The pours were particularly generous with this wonderful menu, which seemed appropriate when celebrating the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their domestic servants in the post-Edwardian era.  While I was a huge fan of the show, you don\u2019t need to have ever watched \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d to enjoy this menu enormously. With courses like Salmon Caviar, Pickled Squash and King Crab on Iliana Regan\u2019s famous house made bread, the menu does not need to tie directly to the show, as the stunningly beautiful courses are fascinating and sumptuous beyond compare. I have loved many of Elizabeth Restaurant\u2019s menus, but this one is my favorite yet!  With such incredibly fine ingredients, I found this menu to be an excellent value for the price. The \"Thermidor\" of Charred Langoustine with Pickled Rose\u201d was my favorite course. I also loved the unique mushrooms, including matsutake and enoki. They play a prominent role in this menu and are, of course, cooked to perfection. The \u201cFoie Gras and Dry Aged Beef with Fermented Berry, and Buckwheat\u201d are seducing me back for another dinner while this menu lasts.  Chef Iliana Regan is a James Beard Best Chef nominee and winner of Food and Wine Best New Chef. Elizabeth Restaurant\u2019s well-deserved Michelin star shines brightly through this exquisite menu. As long as tickets are available, you will not want to miss this menu.",

We had so much fun with the Downton Abbey menu that I absolutely have to experience it again. One of my guests had never seen the show and she enjoyed dinner just as much as we did. Being a fan of the PBS hit \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is not essential to enjoying this important menu.  Can a dinner be important? Yes, I think this one can. The Downton Abbey menu is decisively my favorite Elizabeth Restaurant menu ever. The brilliance of Iliana Regan, is that she is an impressionist chef who never replicates dishes, but rather deconstructs and rebirths them as something entirely different. The heirloom dishes become a theme, more so than a model for her. Her creations generally far exceed the appeal of what she\u2019s riffing on, and herein lies her culinary and artistic magic.  Impressionist painting includes visible brush strokes, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of perception, and unusual visual angles. This is what I mean when I say that Iliana Regan is an impressionist chef. The menu is a blend of traditional and unique elements, but everything is translated through her unique and beautiful way of creating. For instance, the foie gras with vegetable crudit\u00e9s is served in her signature style reminiscent of Bunny the Bakery\u2019s famous Foie Gras Owls on a bed of what can only be described as a superbly beautiful garden of vegetables so fresh and delicious that one notices how truly beautiful their textures and forms are.  I also booked something new that I haven\u2019t tried before. Elizabeth Restaurant now has \u201cCasual Sundays\u201d where they serve family-style. These meals feature entrees like friend chicken, fish fry, or a whole roasted pig. I read that the friend chicken pop-ups that Chef Regan hosted last year were amazing and I was very sad that I had missed them. I just bought tickets for three Casual Sundays to increase my odds of catching a fried chicken night.  I also came for brunch recently and need to come back soon. The crust on the homemade sourdough was amazing and I\u2019m watching for another bread-making class to arise, so that I can learn the secret behind Elizabeth Restaurant\u2019s bread.",

The courses were too generous and numerous to write about them all, so I'll review only a few. The amuse blew my mind and I knew it was only up from there. \u201cCrisp Bread, Salmon Caviar and Pickled Squash with King Crab and Candied Lemon\u201d burst with flavor in my mouth. The next course was a perfect oyster with dashi that made me never want to eat an oyster without dashi again. This is the melding of flavors that will have me craving dashi on every oyster forever. The \u201cDry Aged Beef with Fermented Berry and Buckwheat\u201d was amazing on its sourdough bread. I would make this my last meal. The \u201cStuffed Swiss Chard with House made Bacon, Minnesota Wild Rice, Pumpkin, and Sunflower\u201d was such a lovely contrast to the dry aged beef.  Chef Iliana Regan is most certainly a genius. This is the fifth menu I\u2019ve enjoyed at Elizabeth and truly, the restaurant keeps besting itself. The Downton Abbey menu is magnificent from start to finish. The \u201cYorkshire Pudding With Rose Petal Ice Cream, Cured Egg Yolk and Rose Oil\u201d would have pleased even Aunt Violet and softened her tough exterior. As a beekeeper, the \u201cProfiterole with Bee Pollen Ice Cream and Pickled Pear\u201d is my favorite dessert of all times.  This menu was a trip through the richness of Downton Abbey, but it\u2019s clear that Mrs. Patmore could not have ever engineered such finery. This exquisite menu, the best I\u2019ve ever had, could happen only at Elizabeth Restaurant.",
