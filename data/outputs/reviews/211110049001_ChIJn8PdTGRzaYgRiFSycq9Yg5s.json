All the staff were incredible, very polite and good sense of humor. The food was just......wow. We all travel alot and know great food. You will not be disappointed here. Doc is a legitimate chef, not a line cook. All six of us were thoroughly impressed. Even the coffee was incredible. I can't say enough good things about this place. Please go visit them, don't let this lull business close this place down. It is an absolute gem.",

The pastries are very good I had a bear claw. Also met chef Reed who craved the ice sculpture on display when you walk in. Very easy going place",
