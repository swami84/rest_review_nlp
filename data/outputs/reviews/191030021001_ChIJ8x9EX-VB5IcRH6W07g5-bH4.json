Since being rebranded in 2012 as the Iowa City Downtown District, the district has expanded with new housing options, new festivals such as Taste of Iowa City and the Downtown Block Party. Most parking ramps downtown are free for the first hour and on-street metered parking is free after 6 p.m. Each week it seems like a new restaurant or business concept is opened and the facelift to the beloved Pedestrian Mall will be a welcome addition.",
