The start was a bit slow but you could see the server was taking care of all the tables in the lounge so we were absolutely fine with this.  The starters were excellent, oysters and escargot. Next time I will ask for no cheese on the escargot.  We ordered the NY Strip and Filet with au poivre, very interesting. The steak was crusted in pepper and a goose neck with a caramelized butter. Completely not what I wanted or expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise. My wife is French, so she was not expecting it this way either, will not order it for her again, but I will!  Sundays they have a 50% off wine page at the end of the list. We ordered the Shafer TD, what a super wine..  Overall the service, dinner ambiance and interaction with the server, and GM was wonderful.  I look forward to going back very soon!",

We started with the fried shrimp appetizer which was pretty good. I enjoyed the tartar sauce very much. After, we both got the filet and lobster tail, and the filet was delicious. But sadly we both found the lobster tail to be quite lacking. Almost as if it was just boiled and served plain. We also ordered corn, mashed potatoes, and the mushrooms as our sides. They weren't bad but they really weren't anything special either.  We both had 1 drink each and our bill came to about $250 before tip. Which was around what I had expected, but after eating the dinner I personally felt we could have gotten a very similar satisfaction for less at another steakhouse. I realize I have not tried much of the menu, but based off this experience The Prime Rib wouldn't be my first choice for going out for a nice steak in Baltimore next time. Although I would not completely write it off, or be opposed to giving it a second chance on a less busy night.",

We all had tremendously chewy slices which turned off a couple of us.  Sides were excellent as was dessert.  Perhaps the filet would have been a better choice.  All in all it was a good time.",

We have come here  without reservations & eaten at the bar which was fine.  The concierge seats you, usually quickly & efficiently.  The server,  all men, arrives within a couple of minutes & takes your drink order. He will ask if you need more time with the menu when he arrives with the drinks. We always order the prime rib, the 12 oz cut which is $47 & the side orders cost about $8 each.  We never get an appetizer because the prime rib is enormous.  The large cut is (I think)  $74. Both cuts come with fresh horse radish & au jus.  The prime rib is cooked to perfection & we always complement it with Greenberg potato skins, a dish the Prime Rib claims to have invented.  It is served with 2 different sauces which we ignore & scarf them with gusto.  If the dinner is a special occasion,  they usually serve a free dessert of chocolate mousse in a cream sauce & a strawberry.  The prime rib is consistently the best I've ever had.  You can order it blackened, with au poivre, or with Bearnaise sauce or many others. There is a 3 piece band with a piano player, a saxophonist & a guitarist playing softly in the background.  We have never been disappointed at the Prime Rib & doubt you will. Everything is attended to, every wish & desire.  It is not cheap but if you don't drink too much alcohol the bill will be high but worth every penny.  Enjoy!",

The staff all worked together to take great care of everyone and I was impressed by the service as much as the food, which was incredible.  Everything from start to finish was top notch--starting with the small loaf of warm, fresh crusty bread, the delicious potato skins, my husband's steak and my flounder stuffed with crab imperial, the creamed spinach side, and now let me get to the desserts!!!  They very kindly brought us a complimentary piece of chocolate pie for our anniversary, which was an unexpected treat, but I don't like chocolate so my husband got the pie to himself while I ordered the strawberry cheesecake.  It was probably the best cheesecake I've ever had, and it was HUGE.  Joseph, our server, was incredibly busy but took excellent care of us.  If you have a special occasion, you couldn't do better than The Prime Rib.",

They do have a bit of a limited menu so if you are not going for steak or ribs I would say go somewhere else. The place is really classy and they even have a lunge singer which i found really fun.  You are coming here for the rich food nothing more nothing less. It is fine dining and while the price is high, I've seen worse in Maryland and this is downtown Baltimore so you know it is going to be cheap. I wish they had more then just specifically drinks that cost so much. We just had water. My husband really enjoyed his ribs and was even really full by the end of it which is not like him. He said the meat was falling off the bone and the saute was so well blended that he wanted to find out what recipe they had used.  I had the chicken breast and some corn and when I say that the corn melted in my mouth it did. I can't say I have had anything better then that before.  He also got a small piece of cake because it was his birthday and we had made a regression. The chocolate was so rich and he really enjoyed it and he is not a sweets kind a person.  I would say it's worth the price, just know that the price is a bit high.",

I had the prime rib and my wife had flounder stuffed with crab which she believes was the best she has ever had . There house salad was delicious and the creamed spinach did not disappoint . I tried the the potato skins with horseradish add on as a previous reviewer had mentioned . Phenomenal ! The oyster Rockefeller was also great . I liked there shrimp cocktail which I get just about anywhere I get a chance . This was the best food we had while in Baltimore . If I lived here I would be a regular there . I thought the food was reasonably priced for the quality of what you get . If I had to pick out any negative at all it would be the size of restaurant . It\u2019s close quarters eating .

We go every year and will continue our tradition.  If you want to try a great place with great food- go to the Prime Rib.",

We made reservations during restaurant week and so glad we did. We were seated right away and was immediately taken cared of. I ordered the Caribbean Punch, which was very good. Our meal included a starter, a choice of an entreee, and dessert. I jad the Caesar salad and my husband had the Roasted Tomato Soup. For our entrees, my husband had the filet mignon and for $5 extra the Prime Rib both cooked medium rare. For dessert, he had Key Lime Pie and I had the Creme Brulee along with double shot of espresso and a cup of coffee. Everything was cooked beautifully. The sour note: the side garnish of horseradish could be left off the plate, too spicy, bitter and disgusting. Bathroom could use some dusting as well as the booths. Other than that we were pleased and will be back especially for the coffee and Creme Brulee! Sad there is no way to take it to go.",

For this kind of money, $100 a person for dinner plus a good sized bar tab, I was hoping for a more memorable experience. He got the order wrong, was not terribly attentive, and seemed to be sad. I hope this was not the norm and that he was only having a tough shift, but once was enough for me. Don't want to gamble with the chance of getting a waiter that seemed to have contempt for us.

The bartender was great and whole place has a very formal atmosphere. The dim lighting in the dining room would make for a romantic dinner. A live pianist enhanced the atmosphere. The prime rib was very good it the roll was not very good. It was fresh but a bit heavy and the softness turned gummy in the mouth. A good French dip should come on a genuine French baguette, light and airy on the inside with a thin crisp crust. If that\u2019s not available then a light brioche will suffice. I started the meal with a shrimp cocktail. If the shrimp was fresh then it was overcooked with a bit of toughness. If not, it could have been because it was frozen. While not up to the standards of Lawry\u2019s Prime Rib or the Prime Rib in San Francisco (no relation) it was good enough that I would go again.",

I would've given a 5 star for all of that, but the FOOD just wasn't nearly worth the price. The salad was not very different from a school cafeteria quality. We got a halibut and prime rib. The halibut was a little fishy and the prime rib was gamey.  The au gratin potatoes were fantastic.  We really wanted to love the place (we were there to celebrate), but were really disappointed with the quality of the food. Just not worth the ticket price and not at the level of the rest of the place (ambiance and service).",
