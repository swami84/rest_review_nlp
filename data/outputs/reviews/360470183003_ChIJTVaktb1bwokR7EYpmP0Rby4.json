I get up to see what the hold up was and the waiter was literally just standing there. As we got up to leave, he apologized and said he was the only waiter working. Although he was very nice about it, there were only 3 tables filled in the entire restaurant, And he wasn\u2019t even busy. he could\u2019ve came to see if we needed more water or came to take our main entree order in the meantime. I lived in Thailand for years, so I was excited to try this place and never would walk out of a restaurant unless the service was that bad... and it was that bad. Went to thaiholic instead and got our food 5 minutes after we sat down.",

I'm a vegetarian and I had the eggplant appetizer where they slice it down the middle and roast it, add a spicy sweet sauce. Ate the whole 'plant even the top which was very flavorful. Tofu and vegetable soup was delicious, the bowl was the size of my head and a half - devoured it. Staff was friendly and perfectly attentive. Too full for dessert but it looked tasty - will be going back.",

The food i really enjoyed because the lunch is a great deal which i highly recommend. Also it is enough for 1 person. The lunch special is worthwhile. I ordered the chicken pineapple fried rice with the soup and as an appetizer i got the curry puff and the gyoza. Now i will say that i enjoyed the soup because it was actually spicy and im a lover of spicy food. The appetizers were also very delicious. Over all i would recommend ppl to eat her and I will be returning.",

I questioned this and was told by the woman helping me I was charged extra because I ordered shrimp and chicken in my soup. I told her I only ordered shrimp. Then she told me shrimp was extra. I opened the menu to show her this wasn\u2019t the case.  She told me the menu was wrong!  We argued this point, until I told her to just remove the soup from my bill. Unfortunately she\u2019d already charged my card & didn\u2019t know how to void the charge.  Finally about 10 minutes later the charges were resolved and I left the restaurant with my food which was now colder than it was warm, under my arm.  As I turned the corner off of Myrtle a woman from the kitchen ran after me offering soup gratis, with many apologies.  It was a very kind gesture.  I would ignore all of this trouble if the food was good, however that was not the case. The vegetarian main course I ordered with string beans and peppers had a scant few of both. I was looking forward to having a new Thai restaurant close to home, but I am sorry to say I won\u2019t be returning.",

Since they opened a week ago I've eaten in with my girlfriend, and ordered take out for myself. The food is surprisingly good. I've had the Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and Ba Mee Pooh Moo Dang which were all great, and the Curry Puffs were super tasty.  It's a great spot, and the service is excellent. I'm happy to see a restaurant like this move into the neighborhood even though I'm moving out.",
