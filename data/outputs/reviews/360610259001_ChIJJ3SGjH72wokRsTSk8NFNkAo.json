I went somewhere else (wont shame this place with their competition) and they blew this place out the water and the portions were bigger, had more flavor and each dish was cheaper by at least 4 dollars. This place is close to a police precinct and you can barely find parking. I had to double park and wait 30 min for food that sucked...I do not recommend for their prices.Just my opinion but beware especially if youve never had the food before. They serve their takeout in styrofoam containers with the food slapped on the bread they give you then they cover it up making it soggy and the sauces to the food soak in...Never again. Not worth the money gas or my taste buds. In all fairness though the people who work there are friendly but friendliness has nothing to do with presentation and taste.",

They had great lamb and chicken dishes, and on Saturday or Sunday you could get some wicked fish ball soup! If you ordered early enough. Then Benyam popped up. It took me a while to come in for the first time but eventually the art on the inside and the little stand of potted plants on the outside drew me in. I immediately regretted waiting so long. The food is phenomenal! It seems a little pricey but the ingredients are quality and the portions are good so you do get what you pay for. The fellas who work there, and the matriarch of the place, are always genuinely friendly and act like it\u2019s their pleasure to serve you. No really! It\u2019s kinda crazy how much love they put into the place and the food. My only complaint would be that when I call for take out (since I live across the street I always get take out) it takes a bit long. But then I go in and see Benyam serving all these happy people who have seemingly trekked uptown or in from out of town for some delicious food and I don\u2019t mind the wait as much. It\u2019s manna from heaven!",

The sides of shiro and gomen were expected but cooked so perfectly. Add'l vegetable sides are only $4!  You can tell each dish is cooked with pure love. And when asked how she managed to blow me away, the chef (owner's sister) echoed those sentiments. She literally said she loves to cook for people and see them enjoy her food. I wish she lived in my home and cooked for me every day. But alas I would never lose my \"baby\" weight.",

We just explained that we wanted to try a little of everything and he brought us out some delicious apps and then a full family style meal that included lamb and chicken. As I tried each dish I could tell with each bite that not only was the food made with quality ingredients but it was home cooked with love. It was one of those meals that I will surely never forget! Excellent food, Superb service, and a comfortable atmosphere for friends and family alike. Two thumbs up and many thanks. :-)",
