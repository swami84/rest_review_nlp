One of the times I was given a drink that I didn\u2019t order, only to be told after it arrived that they ran out of tequila. Understandable! But that should be communicated before I order (or at least ask if I want something else instead of just giving me an alternate). Service was borderline rude and confusing throughout. No manager ever touched our table.  The food was actually good and a highlight but two of those in my group had the wrong order/specifications.  I am a lifelong service industry person, so all of this could be written off as a bad night. But after reading responses to other reviews by the owner, I am amazed that they (or whomever is running the account) would respond to guests in such an accusatory, pretentious, short, and rude manner.",

But Lucky Buns salad burgers (recent favorite is the Keu bun, with Gouda, pickled daikon, garlic mayo, sriracha, and other good stuff) and fried chicken (the Mumbo bun or Dirty Bird are \ud83d\udd25 - you can get grilled chicken but the no-bun cancels the fried part, right?) come with a perfectly crunchy, green goddess-dressed salad that I would actually look forward to eating on its own. They also have BeerLao, occasional Thai pop-ups, and great cocktails (last one I had with bourbon, passion fruit, and sesame chili oil was uniquely delicious). If you sit at the bar you can watch Bob Ross/The Joy of Painting on repeat. The patio is great for summer. Staff is super friendly (and working extra hard right now to keep take-out going!).",

The portions were perfect, a single burger fills up the small to average appetite and the double patty is great for those who are really feeling the hunger. The seating is limited, so be prepaired for a short wait on busy days, and it can get loud inside so I recommend the porch for those who dislike small crowded areas. I look forward to coming again!",

In lieu of supporting a local charity they hosted a happy hour for a big tech company.

They take reservations for groups of six or more so I had to gather some friends but was finally able to try it and I have been back atleast three times since.  Amongst the group we had a variety of different sandwiches including El Jefe, Dirty bird, Chicky bun, Hot tiger, and the OG. We also shared orders of Patatas bravas and spice bag.  The El Jefe burger certainly lived up to my crazy expectations. It is a burger accentuated with a hatch chilli and gouda cheese. It was a subtly spicy burger that really hit the spot.  Two of the burgers warn you in advance that they are not subtle when it comes to spice. The dirty bird is on the milder side of the two and makes for a fantastic crispy chicken sandwich. The hot tiger is made with a chilli paste and the spice lingers for quite some time, both both sandwiches were well received and prepared very well.  As far as the burgers are concerned that leaves the OG and Chicky Bun both of which are essentially the plain options. They are that is name alone and both pack good taste and are prepared fantastically.  As for the sides the patatas bravas (smothered tater tots) were prepared crispy with a soft inside. The sauce that covered them was an enhanced version of a spicy mayo. Additionally, the spice bag which was fries (& Chicken) in a bag shaken with a spice mix and keeping with the theme they were prepared crispy and the chicken was very tender.  Overall, I would highly recommend this resturant. Lucky buns boasts great food and friendly service.",

We went on a Sunday evening, and arrive shortly before opening, so we sat on the patio and waited for the restaurant to open. When it did we had our choice of tables (pick the front window, you get the most room), and staff came over quickly. Food is made to order, so there's a tiny wait, but it's so worth it, and it's not a long wait by any means. Both my fiance and I loved our burgers, I got the El jefe (the green chile was just the right touch of spicy) and he got the Beastie. Fries were yummy too! Overall, definitely worth getting there a bit early and waiting as the restaurant was completely full before our burgers were out. It's a small place when they don't have the patio open (we went at the end of February on a beautiful day, so waiting outside was pleasant but you wouldn't want to sit outside for a whole meal), but so so so worth it. We will definitely be back.",

The chicken wings are overpriced and mine were burnt but why complain for 4 wings that I paid around $15 for when you know you won\u2019t be back. But also the server was not welcoming she just seemed very rude. The drinks here are straight shots of liquor I ordered a captain and coke and was told there was no rum then had to get a jack and coke and ended up getting a jack and ice since there was so much alcohol in my drink. I tried again with a Bombay and OJ and ended up getting a Bombay and ice so no luck the second time. But on the bright side if you want to get drunk real quick then go here I guess.",

I then ask if I can come back at 4:50 PM to get seated early and she says no. I then ask if I can wait outside until they are seating and she says that wouldn't be a good idea either. She literally was being as vague as one can possibly be about the best time to come back to avoid the wait when it was a simple question to begin with.

However, there was one bartender that was obnoxious and likely drunk or hungover. He ended up getting an attitude with me when I asked him if he had a chance to grab the beer that I'd ask for 10 minutes earlier. I chalked it up to him having a bad day and ignored him but then noticed that he over charged my credit card. My gut tells me it was some sort of intentional payback on his part for displeasing somehow. It's really disappointing because the first bartender that was there when I arrived made me a great mezcal cocktail but he left when his shift ended and this other guy took over and made the whole experience unpleasant. Plain and simple - this one shady bartender is a cancer to an otherwise great hamburger spot.",

I tried ordering one of the specialty burgers with the BaconXO jam to be told it was 86\u2019d. Which I totally understand. So I ordered the basic Lucky Buns double with a side of the Curry Chips (fries). And had two of the $11 Japanese White Ale which you have to ask for a cold glass for. Really for $11!! It took quite awhile for the food to arrive and first came the Curry Chips before the burger. Why would the fries arrive in advance of the burger?  Timing seemed way off in the kitchen.  They were cold which seemed weird due to their open kitchen which seemed busy. I told the super polite and good Bartender and he apologiezed. He took them away and I watched as he consulultd with what must be a manager whom then proceeded to turn his back to me. He the manager never approached me to offer another dish or any apologies. The burger finally came and while good seems to have big chunks of far as well as two hard bites into what must hav been bone or cartilage (super gross!!).  I mentioned to the bartender when he brought the check it\u2019s bad service a manager never approached me, he was apologetic but the manager seemed to be right there (the place is tiny!!) did not seemed to care about me. Poor service, cold food, and poor quality! Look elsewhere for a good burger is DC there\u2019s lots of options! BTW- I\u2019m a senior manager in the hotel business here in the city so I know poor service when I receive it!",

The burgers are amazing, for lack of a better superlative. They are definitely the juiciest burgers I've had in DC to date, and perfect mix of flavors. They also do unbelievable fries, cut thicker and fried super crispy with fluffy inside, which you can also get in the curry version (didn't try that yet). I love that on top of doing great food, the place has a very relaxed and super friendly vibe too. It almost looks too good to be true, but it actually is! Totally going back for another burger very soon!",

Also, you can only order your burger rare or well done which I didn\u2019t like. For the price, you should be able to order your burger any way you like. My burger tasted ok, but it was insanely messy and I was unable to eat it with my hands. My burger also had a pineapple on it (yum!) but it still had the core in it which was very tough and impossible to eat. My friend got a chicken sandwich which tasted good, but it was extremely salty.

We called in, to see about burger week, and she couldn't answer any questions, and kept giving rude answers. We arrived,and got to meet the hostess, and she was just as rude in person. I asked her what burgers are part of burger week and her response was \" I couldn't tell you because I'm the hostess. You'll have to ask your server.\" Is it too much to know the most basic of questions, during the one week which is dedicated to burgers. YOUR HOSTESS SUCKS!!! PAY ATTENTION TO THE OTHER COMPLAINTS BELOW!!! We finally got seated outside, and was informed that all orders must go through the bar. So to recap, our experience, we were met with rudeness, we had to get up and go place our orders inside at the bar, and we had to get up to get refill our own drinks. So who do we tip??? No one!!! There was no service to deserve a tip. We then hear a waitress, actually take the order of the table behind us. Maybe race was a factor? Maybe it was because I had my kids? I dont know, but this needs to be worked on. The only reason I didn't give this one star, is because the only thing good about this place was that the burger was actually really good. The one that I had to go order inside, because I was the one  table that was too inconveniencing to have a waitress take our order. Will not return!  Update 1: I emailed you as requested!  Update 2: I emailed these guys, as requested, and there has been no response. They probably don't care.",

        "caption": "It\u2019s finally a sunny day after a week of torrential downpours. I find out it\u2019s DC burger week. It seemed like the perfect time to finally try Lucky Buns, which I\u2019ve heard a lot about from food critics and friends.  While out before dinner, I tell a friend I\u2019m going to Lucky Buns. She warned, \u201cThe food is worth it if you can get past the mean hostess.\u201d I shrug off this comment finding it odd.  Our Uber arrives a few moments after seven. The restaurant is lined with empty tables. I point an empty table and say let\u2019s sit at this one. By God out of nowhere a hostess stops me and says \u201cWe\u2019re booked and you\u2019re not getting a seat until 8:31 - no earlier.\u201d It felt like a challenge. I told her to put my name down for four. She said \u201cI said it will be over an hour and half. I will not call you until 8:31.\u201d I accept the challenge. She pulls out scratch from under her podium that probably doubles down as weapon, writes my name down, and writes 8:31 and underlines it several times.  We go across the street to have a drink at another lovely AdMo establishment. My phone rings. It\u2019s 8:24. I was pleasantly surprised. I answer and get a quick \u201cYour table is ready\u201d and click.  Over an hour and half wait, we picked up another to join us. We are directed to our table. The hostess stops and says \u201cYou said four. I wrote down four.\u201d I ask if we can pull another chair up. \u201cIf you can find one and get it yourself, sure. But don\u2019t bother anyone.\u201d  The waiter comes up. He is knowledgeable. The meat is from a great farm in Kansas, the staff all come from fine dining, and they have lots of unique options. I order the lucky bun with bacon rashers and patatas bravas. I order one of their specialty manhattans. Everything was lovely and the food was delicious. One of the best burgers I\u2019ve had.  At the end, my partner asks the waiter \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the hostess?\u201d The waiter doesn\u2019t show any sign of emotion or answer the question. It\u2019s clear she is in control. And he is afraid of her. Maybe she is part of the experience. A right of entry.  We leave through the door without making eye contact with her. \u2018Twas an experience. I\u2019ll be back.  But if I\u2019m not, you know who did it.  TLDR: food is great, staff knowledgeable, but you have to get past the hostess/bouncer first (look at other reviews to confirm). God speed and bon appetite.",

Upon arrival, was told that we would not be seated before 8:31 (it was 7 pm and there were some open seats) for a party of 4 and questioned whether or not we wanted to return. When we got the call at 8:24, we were pleasantly surprised! Showed up with an extra friend and were told by the hostess there were no more chairs in the restaurant and that if we happened to find one, were warned not to disturb others. We found another chair and enjoyed our meal - the waiter was knowledgeable and provided delicious food and drink recommendations. Not sure why the hostess (based on reviews) is consistently unwelcoming.",
