My friend, paid the  exact same as i did for the same drink, and now that I am asking to put alcohol in a drink that is supposed to have it, i was being blown away.

The pros: This place is right on the river, super casual, order your food/drinks at the counter/bar area, they give you your drinks right away and bring your food shortly thereafter to your table. We were there on a Friday night and they had a DJ which was cool, good music. Beautiful views as you eat. Staff seems very conscious about sanitation and keeping things safe amidst COVID times. The cons: this place can do much better!! It feels like it's just a spot that people will see first along the River walk and go eat there cuz it looks nice, and since there's that lure, they don't feel the need to impress via food or drink. The drinks and food are way overpriced for what you get...I understand this is on the river and that Chicago is expensive. Yes $14 is a pretty standard rate for a drink, but they literally poured the drink from a premixed pitcher and threw a lime on my paloma and a mint leaf on my husband's mojito. No. They should be making the drinks to order, or charge less. We got a variety of tacos and they were all just meh. $60 for a mediocre meal, and I won't be back. I honestly don't care if there's some price gouging for a good view/ambiance, but I want to still feel like it was worth it, that the food at least tasted great, but I can't say that for here. I would honestly save your money and either eat somewhere else along the river, or simply bring your own food and go just a bit further down the Riverwalk and find a spot to plop down and eat there!",
