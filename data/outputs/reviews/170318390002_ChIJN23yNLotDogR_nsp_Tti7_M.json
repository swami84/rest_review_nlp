Everything on the menu was appealing and made choosing quite difficult, but all four people in our party were totally pleased with our orders.  We loved our entrees, the warm bread with olive oil & parmesan and our desserts (Tiramisu and Triple Chocolate Mousse).  The wine choices and cocktails were perfect as well.  The ambience of the restaurant was also upscale yet intimate & relaxing.  I can't neglect to mention our waiter (Jack B).  He was both engaging and attentive to our needs.  We look forward to returning and will definitely ask for him again.  Thank you for a superb dining experience and enjoyable evening!",

We made the decision that it was absolutely necessary to really go out. Put on your heels, a nice shirt, those dangly earrings you got on vacation, and go. We also decided to treat the parents, who are equally due for a night out. We came across Pacino's by happenstance, but it was a chance encounter that felt like everything had just lined up. We lucked out with a table inside as it was a bit cold out and were instantly greeted. The menu is diverse and easy to read, so we got to decide on a bottle of Moscato, grilled calamari, and a Limoncello Martini to start. The grilled calamari was done to perfection, fork-soft and a perfect balance between buttery and smoky. The drinks came out quickly and the table bread was crispy on the outside, pillowy on the inside. All off to a wonderful start. For entrees, we decided on veal Parmesan, chicken Parmesan,  pappardelle with tomato-cream sauce with sausage, and linguine mediterraneo. High marks all around, everything was delicious. For dessert, the easy choice was tiramisu, which was remarked around the table as the best we'd ever had. The owner was very kind to thank us for coming, which was a very nice touch. We will certainly be back.",
