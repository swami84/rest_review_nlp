I set the pick up time about an hour after I placed my order online, and then arrived 25- 35 minutes after the app had estimated the food would be ready (so 1.5 hours since I ordered the food). Food still wasn\u2019t ready. Came back in 10 and they got my order together.",

        "caption": "Quantity, quality, and good customer service.  As of dec 24th 2020 their food was great. We got the chicken korma, kerala pepper chicken and garlic Naan. The curries were both spicy (enough for my Indian girlfriend) and flavorful. The garlic Naan was good, but was a little dry. My reasoning for the 5 star review is because the quantity was more than any other Indian restaurant while still tasting just as good if not better. We have recently been having trouble with finding a decent Indian restaurant in the area and we will definitely be trying adda again. P.s. this is a real person leaving this review",
