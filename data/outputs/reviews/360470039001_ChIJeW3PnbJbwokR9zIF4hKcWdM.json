        "caption": "This was one of the worst/humiliating racist experiences I\u2019ve had at a restaurant. My friend suggested the place who is of Indian decent. Out of mutual excitement to try the food I agreed. We were seated pretty quickly since the place was basically empty. We observed the waiter quickly refilled her water glass and neglected mines. Not wanting to jump to conclusions I didn\u2019t think anything of it since my glass wasn\u2019t as empty until it happened again; at this point my glass was nearly empty. Finally on the waiters third pass he filled both our glasses and of course mines was noticeably not as full as my friend\u2019s. Due to there being minimal table space while trying to shift around the dishes my fork fell on the ground, one of the waiters then attempted to place the fork back on the table. Then to make matters works while the first waiter cleaned the rice off the ground he was cursing while sweeping. When my friend requested to go plates he returned with one bag and sat it in front of her. She then gave me the bag and requested another. The waiter began to pack her food. Last, if you noticed I had to keep calling him \u201cthe waiter\u201d. He never introduced himself and didn\u2019t give us a customer copy of the receipt.",

After watching and listening to a loud group, 6-8 guys, probably what looks to be friends of the workers and delivery persons, 40 minutes later I hear a sizzling sound, like a mexican fajita sizzling.  Tandoori is a dry meat oven baked in a clay pot and what thw waiter set in front of me was horrifing.  Everything was sizzling in grease. The table, my arm and clothes were getting splattered with hot grease.  I'm a great cook at home and it was evident all my food was deep fried and over cooked.  Now I know why this schithole was empty at lunch hour.  VOID THIS PLACE and find a real authentic indian cusine, or you might get splattered with grease from a dish that was supposed to be oven baked in a clay pot. YUCK! I left most of it swimming is the grease, paid my $20.00 and ran like hell.",

The containers are very soft, so by the time it gets here, to me, to a customer, it is everywhere, but not in the container.  I called the restaurant, wanted to speak to a manager and may be give an advise, to use stronger containers, but a rude person answered the phone, said that the manager is not there and he is not sure when he'll be in... So, hopefully, the manager will see this review and make some changes, because it would be a shame. The food is absolutely delicious and it would be a shame if bad service would drive customers away from this place. Regardless of  how tasty the food is we, as customers, expect service, and when that's missing, unfortunately, I would not go back.
