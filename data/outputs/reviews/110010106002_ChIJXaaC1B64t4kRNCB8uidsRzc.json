        "caption": "Everybody who lives and works here knows how expensive it can be to eat in D.C.. Fortunately I work right where Uptown Cafe is located. They are a great place for breakfast and lunch with relatively decent prices, compared to a lot of other places. I love breakfast and hate skipping that meal, so I think a breakfast platter consisting of scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and two slices of toast each cut in half for about $6 and some change is not bad at all. They also have good omelette platters, a french toast platter and a pancake platter. All of them are good. I also like their fruit smoothies and big fruit cups. For lunch they make a great assortment of different sandwiches, also reasonably priced. I love their BLT, it is one of the best I've eaten. The ladies who work here are always so nice and polite no matter how busy they get, and this place can get very busy first thing in the morning with people coming off the metro and hungry for breakfast. They also have many items of convenience much like you'd find in any convenience store, including candy, muffins, Danish, doughnuts, bananas, apples, oranges, a wide variety of beverages and a decent coffee selection as well. Their to-go plates are high quality. Overall, just a great place here on M Street Northeast.",

It was very apparent the she was overwhelmed with the crowd instead of closing the shop down she tries to accommodate 10 plus people standing in line. While waiting for my meal I pre pay to help expedite things, so I can grab my food and go once ready. I noticed the customer in front of me waiting seemed to do the same however, when he was began to pick up his meal and leave she did not remember charging him and debated that he paid. Long /short, she did the same with me! She asked if I could prove that the paid for the meal and forgot that she changed me!! she did not give me a receipt when I paid first. I have been to this place often and figured this would not be an issue, having to get to work on time I could not argue with a person who should have better business knowledge when dealing with money and quick transactions. I called my bank canceled the charge.   I was treated as if I was asking for a hand out or a free meal \u201clack of value as a repeat customer\u201d is why I write this. I will never return to this Caf\u00e9 and warn others.",
