Tiramisu was partially frozen and the lady fingers were dry. So disappointed.  To call this traditional Italian food is a massive insult  but the people are kind.",

Service started out ok, but near the end of our meal, a few annoying regulars walked in and got all of our servers attention. 15 minutes after eating, we finally were offered boxes and a check. Planned on coffee and dessert, but the annoying regulars ruined the atmosphere with their loud talking. Disappointing experience after being blown away last time. Saved this visit for a special occasion, which ended up a terrible mistake. Will find another venue next time I\u2019m in the mood for Italian.",

They forgot our appetizer and did not bring bread until  we had asked several times. . The coffee was cold.. The sprite tasted like a mix of iced tea and other drinks combined and the salad had so much dressing I thought they had brought soup instead.   We decided to leave at that point and offered to pay for what they had served so far.  They actually threatened to call the police and said that they did not need customers like \"you people\" As my wife is Hispanic I sure hope they were not making a racist comment.  We ended up paying for what they had already served and will never come back. The are so many other restaurants near by that respect their customers and treat them well.    After reading other reviews it is apparent that the owners are indeed racist.  Several other people of color have posted similar reviews.  If Lincoln were alive I'm sure he would not be pleased with a racist restaurant so close to his home.  I would not recommend anyone eat there.",

It is an older restaurant that has an old time, quaint feel to it.  You are waiting for Frank, Dean, and the rest of the Rat Pack to come through the door.

I came in to this restaurant June 22nd for the first time and asked for a take out menu. As I am looking over the take out menu I could notice the cashier looking at me as if he was irritated by my presence. I ignore the way he looks and I approach him to place my order and when questioning him about certain items on the menu he replies with a nasty attitude and tone while rolling his eyes. He does this repeatedly so I ask to speak to the manager and a lady approaches me and says may be he is having a bad day. I tell her having a bad day is no excuse to treat a paying customer with disgust and unprofessionalism.  Right then a big husky white guy who is suppose to be the owner comes into my face and says \"oh I've been here 40 years and your kind comes here to pick fights!\" By saying my kind he is referring to me being black and immediately made me guilty due to my skin color. Although he was not a witness to his piss poor employees attitude. He just automatically took his employees side because I am black. After going back and forth I decided not to spend my money with a racist establishment and this owner or manager gets in my face and says I'll beat the piss out of you. I walked out of the restaurant and immediately called the police because he needs to be held accountable. So for those white and black and white especially. Please do not support a racist restaurant that discriminates against others because of the color of there skin..",

Service speed is reasonable and the staff is friendly. I had the manicotti, as did one of my friends, another had the lasagna. It was all very good. Good portions, although I wouldn't expect leftovers until you ate a lot of appetizers first. Its just a great little place to have a friendly meal",

I take the blame for ordering the fish dinner and not understanding that the main ingredients were bread and cheese and sauce. It was explained, but for some reason, I expected more than an ounce of fish. Lots and lots of cheese, tasty sauce, and a lettuce \"salad.\" My bad again for expecting a real \"Italian\" salad with veggies instead of lettuce soaked in salty oily \"Italian\" dressing.\" So I'll absorb the three stars I would have knocked off and give this place five based on my wife's recommendation. Just don't get the fish!! Oh, and if you're not into pork, good luck. Meatballs, meat sauce, and all the other meat dishes except the steak are pork based. But it is a nice place...",

When we said no, she sighed and told us we were going to have to wait for a table before disappearing into the back of the restaurant.  She was this way with the next two sets of diners who came in as well.  When our table was ready, an older gentleman too is back, and was also very unfriendly.  We were sat in a back room, alone to start.  However, our table was larger than anything up front, so we were alright with it.  Two other tables were sat after.  Our server was wonderful, she was friendly, helpful, answered questions, and never made us feel like she was rushing.  The two servers helping the others tables were nearly there exact opposite, to the point our table was discussing the difference between the three of them.  Food arrived in a timely manner.  Though I should mention there is no children's menu here, which was also a problem because we ended up ordering our 4 year old a $15 pizza.  Everyone except me really liked their food (lasagna, tortellini, pizza, and chicken parm).  I preferred the manicotti and was actually quite disappointed.  It was absolutely bland and the pasta was undercooked and nearly crunchy.  When I ate the leftovers I honestly added spices, at which point it was much better.  I'd like to give this place a higher rating, but really can't.  The food was pretty good overall, but a little pricey, and most of the staff we dealt with were unpleasant.  I would consider eating here again at a time it wasn't so busy in case things were better and because everyone else liked their food, but I was overall unimpressed during this particular visit, OTHER THAN our wonderful server.",
