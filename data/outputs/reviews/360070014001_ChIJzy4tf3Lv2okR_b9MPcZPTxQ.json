I'm glad I waited until afterwards, as the food would have been too cold before I was capable of finishing. They were exquisitely kind and thorough in explaining the menu, helping me choose the perfect meal for me (although after much fuss I did arrive at my regular meal of Chicken Tikka Masala). The food was prepared exquisitely to order, using only the finest halal ingredients. I wanted for nothing throughout the entire experience, and was truly treated as family by my standards. I eat Indian food frequently, and often order the Chicken Tikka Masala so that I can compare which restaurant has the best. After today, I can safely say I'm never going to have Chicken Tikka Masala prepared quite as well again. I think I might have to switch to a new dish when I order Indian food again in the future, as nothing else will compare to this experience.",

When we got the chance to sit down to our dinner, hers was spicier than mine. I mean, to the point that she couldn't eat it. I will definitely point this out next time we order but other patrons may want to make sure that spice level is understood, especially with takeout orders where you don't have the opportunity to send it back.",

The manager over there suggested biryani for me and stated that their biryani is the best.. having tasted Briyani at various restaurants in the US and almost every one fail promises.. I made my order simple with mutton biryani, chicken tikka and naan with no time to think much.. I thought its gonna be mediocre Briyani.. but it turns out to be the best Mutton Briyani I have had in the US.. the chicken tikka was excellent.. and the garlic/butter naan were soft and good.. The quantity is good for the price.. Well I have never made any reviews.. but I cannot resist for this one..  I will make sure I visit this restaurant on my next trip too.. :)",

I was expecting to complete It, but couldn't as the taste is so bad and piece is smelly. When i asked the waitress she said as the bone is complete they gave you boneless (without asking me). Right after her someone called Shakeel came and asked about the situation. I explained him and he is telling me that I ate half of it and playing games now, I was not expecting for an apology instead he is blaming me. I have never seen such a kind of person in my life and he says he is working for 20 years. This is my first time giving a rate to someone with so much disappointment.  The place is very bad and no clean at all. The chicken pieces smells and not cocked well. Not to mention but the washroom smells bad and not clean at all.  I hope the management looks into this and changes their behavior.",

We asked for lemon slices to go along with our kebabs and he suggested we borrow them from the ones they served with chicken biriyani that was someone else's on the table.  2. We requested that the rice provided with the curries(by default) be changed to naan. He refused. His reasoning was that rice is easier to cook than naan, so we couldn't  swap. Not only that, we did not even get the rice that was supposed to come with the curries in the first place.  3. He advised us to keep our wallets and phones in our pockets instead of table so that he could keep food - there were two on the table in a group of 10.  4. The food was super bland. Chicken curry (\"Chicken Vindaloo\") had over boiled, stringy chicken and undercooked potatoes. The gravy had a distinct taste of canned tomatoes.  5. Chicken Kadai was also the same. Over boiled chicken and tasteless.  6. Vegetable biriyani was an abomination. Bland rice with boiled vegetables and no spices. An extra small cup of raita(curd) cost us 1.99 dollars. No Indian restaurant charges that amount.  7. They destroyed tea. We ordered masala chai (spiced tea) and it had no spices whatsoever.  The Rogan Josh tasted nothing like what it is supposed to, but was edible. The kebab platter was also edible. The naan was soft. That are the only saving Grace in an otherwise sad and disappointing meal.",

The Chicken dish went really well with recommended Tandoori Naan Bread. Overall great food, we enjoyed ourselves. We can't wait to come back to Binghamton and try some more of their dishes, next time the owner recommended  Mutton Biryani",

The owner who was working as waiter/cook was nice and he gave us some insight about the area. We took his recommendation and ordered chicken biryani. It turned out to be great. We will recommend this place for friends and family.",
