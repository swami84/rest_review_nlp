Upon entering, I was immediately greeted and shown to a table which is always a great first sign.  The entire staff was super friendly and attentive. The food was awesome! I ordered a hamburger and fries. Important to note...I have a serious medical condition and therefore am on a strict no added sodium diet. Oddly enough since the restaurant is called Salt Factory lol, but they were so wonderful about altering my food! Even without salt, the burger had such great flavor and depth. My friend had the Thai Beef Lettuce Wraps and loved them. Also loved the decor here! We will definitely return and I'm spreading the word to my friends about this great place!  COVID note: there are clear dividers between the tables and hand sanitizer was readily available.  All staff wore masks and we were easily distanced from other diners.  UPDATE 03/22/21: Returned for the third time on a Monday (we usually go on Wednesdays) and unfortunately, it was a very different experience. The wait staff was completely different, inattentive and not so friendly. We had to wait a considerable amount of time for them to take our order and ended up calling over the manager(?) to take it as our server never came back. The food quality was no where near what is was previously. We had to send our soup back. After two stellar experiences here, we were very disappointed.",

My husband ordered an Arnold Palmer and they were out of lemonade for the night, so she hand mixed the drink with syrup and sweet tea, which was so thoughtful ! The manager was also very friendly and came around every so often to check on us, he also brought us a dessert because it was our first time( delicious btw) The food and drinks were awesome! We ordered the Louisiana burger, pulled pork tacos, and steakhouse burger, which were great and portion sizes were more than enough, very filling! we'll definitely be back and will be telling others to stop in for the full experience!!!!",

The food was good but not great, some individual components were hot and some were not: hot crabcake cold stale frites on top, hot mashed potatoes cool gravy... Beer could have been colder. The table, menus, cutlery, and bathrooms were clean. Again, friendly staff but service was very slow.  We told our waiter about the stale frites and he just looked at us and said oh.  I had to order my 2nd beer twice.  It seemed the wait staff were too busy in the corner discussing something more important?  Our first time there, maybe they weren't having the best night. Lots of other places to choose from in Alpharetta with much better service.",

The staff was very friendly and accommodating, especially with covid in full swing in GA. We jad a nice little nook outside to have lunch. I had the fish and chips. The fish was very fresh and tasted great. The slaw was out of this world and the fries were perfect. They were also the first restaurant I have been to that not only had ginger ale, but it was fresh and carbonated. My wife and mother in-law both had salads and the raved about them the whole time. The said the salads were the best they had and the loved their dressings. Then we did also have dessert as well. I had the brownie and my wife and mother in-law had creme brule. I tasted the creme brule and it was perfect. My brownie came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a little fudge. Hands down the best brownie dessert ever. I will be telling my friends about this place for sure. Great service, atmosphere and reaaonable prices. You can't go wrong. Absolutely worth going.",

Well, let me add to those good reviews! The atmosphere here was relaxed and not too loud. Our waiter was very attentive but not hovering. When one in our party was indecisive he brought out a sample for her. We ended up staying for 4 hours catching up with each other - never felt rushed. We left a big tip (at least 40%) to hopefully make up for dominating the table. But the best part I haven't mentioned is the FOOD!! SO great!!!  I had their Sheppard's pie that they make with real lamb and not ground beef - DELICIOUS!!!  My husband had the She crab soup and I tasted it - so good!!  I just wish we lived closer as this would be my favorite restaurant to come to often!!",

Seriously, I would eat here 7 days a week if I could afford it, but alas I am not that a baller, so special treat eats is where they stand. At Salt I am 90% a creature of habit and eat the Ahi Tuna Tartare as my main course. It\u2019s melt-in-your-mouth Ahi tuna with avocado and house made wonton crisps. Thanks to Salt I found my most FAVORITE WINE EVER which is Cherry Pie (Pinot Noir),  mmmm, delicious. They have several vegetarian options and many choices that are sure to spark interest in carnivores. My hubby enjoys the Shepherd\u2019s Pie or Gastropub Burger with a glass of Disaronno (which is always a \u201cperfect pour\u201d per him). Staff are always, always, always friendly, even if the location is busy, and whether indoor or outdoor the general vibe of Salt is one that is hard to come by. Do recommend!",

Now for the egg roll.....I can't even explain it's goodness. I have never had anything so flavorful in my life. Whomever is the cook gets 2 thumbs up for me.  For my entree I opted for the chicken fried chicken. Please not that it's enough to feed 2 people. Again, the flavors were amazing. It tasted like \"home\".  I sampled a piece of flank steak from one my dinner mates and it was perfect.  Definitely going back!!",

We still had to wait quite a bit, but it could have been a lot worse. We waited at the bar where the service was excruciatingly slow. At the table it was better but still a little slow & a little forgetful on drink refills/sauce requests. The food was delicious though!!! We each had something different, and every dish was great!! I would say our night was 5 star food with 3 star service. It was a busy night,  however,  with it being a small place it will probably always be a busy night... make your reservations & pack your patience for wonderful food!",

Liz M. is a really solid bartender and she brings it with fantastic service coupled with a great attitude.  My recommedations to eat are definitely the chargrilled oysters, she-crab soup, and meatloaf.  If in the mood for wings, they are darn good if you ask me as they are not too messy.  Stop in, enjoy a cold one with good food, and you just might find yourself a regular.",

Do you yearn to learn more about the world of rare spirits and seek expert advice?  Then your first stop is the bar and say hi to Liz. She will guide you to the best spirit or beer. Looking to experiment, maybe those previous Scotchs were WAY too smoky? She can lighten that up for you or recommend a sugary bourbon to go with your nice filet.  Speaking of selection, I was blown away by the rare spirits on hand. Keep in mind, I refer not to \"Blue\", \"Black\", or \"Red\" label stuff. I'm talking about the secret stuff you never experienced that costs half as much.  Here are a couple spirits to absolutely experience while at Salt Factory.  1. Balvenie Double Wood 14 Year - Legendary single malt from Speyside and rare find at a bar.  2. Monkey 47 - Legendary Gin from the Black Forest of Germany. Yes, 47 botanical ingredients grown deep in the mythical Black Forest of Germany. Best as a dry martini, that only sees but does not touch the bottle of vermouth!  Note to Management - Liz is a keeper and her knowledge along with incredible customer service puts her in a unique position to help guide the choices of spirits at Salt Factory.",

I was planning on taking some leftovers home, but couldn't stop eating, and by the time we were done there wasn't a speck of food left on our plates.  We had the smoked salmon tostada as an appetizer: abundant and delicious, my wife had the hamburger topped with shredded pork and I had the ahi tuna with sticky rice and bok choy.  Dishes were presented in a simple but artsy way, and most importantly packed with taste. On top of that our server was amazing, genuine, efficient, attentive to details, she exemplified what great service feels like. Fabulous summarizes the evening.  We'll be back. Next visit: I returned with my family and my medium rare burger was overdone.  It was very disappointing... Indeed noone is perfect.  It was just a rare bad day in the kitchen I hope.",

I wanted to get the double chicken pot pie but after the waitress told me of how much chicken comes with it I just told her I would have to come back another day to come at lunch time and get it, because that was a lot of food to eat after 9 close to 10 p.m. so I just got the pizza instead. Interesting that I kind of have a slight reaction to the pizza crust although she did tell me that they cleaned everything in the back, I don't know it was just that my bottom jaw and throat became irritated a little bit. But mine boyfriend had the chicken skewers and only two skewers and a little bit of couscous and mint on the side as a garnish, came with it and what look like a couple of slices of pita bread. But I mean the pizza had great flavor! He even told me his food was good although he was still hungry! LOL so I let him have a couple slices of my pizza and he liked it too! So I may go back and try the pot pie. But the waitress I'm glad she did all she could to alert The cooks to let them know of our seafood and nut allergies. Thank you. I never did get her name but thank you. And thank you for the birthday cake. He said it was very sweet... Very sweet. I guess he didn't want to say anything to the waitress because it may have... I don't know I guess he just didn't want to say anything but it was good I took a small bite because I don't care for sweets that much especially sweet chocolate!  Say to the kitchen for the birthday cake, try not to make it too sweet. Okay cuz some people don't like real sweet sweets.",
