        "caption": "Extremely disappointed. Service and food were awful. We had to remind our server multiple times of our drinks before we got them and food took extremely long to get out. We were patient as there was only one server but when we got the food it was a complete disappointment. The nachos were burnt as well as the meat in a steak taco. Sadly I would not recommend and would not go back. There are definitely better mexican spots in the area for the same price. The Jamaica was probably the only good thing from our order.",

It took 20 minutes since we were seated to get our order taken, and then other 20 minutes to get our drinks (no need for preparation, it was beers! - oh, heads up, all drinks are non-alcoholic). Food took 40 minutes to come, and it tasted really bad. The meat was burnt, the nachos had a weird flavor. We mentioned that to the staff, and just got an \u201coh, ok\u201d.  I don\u2019t recommend this place. I was excited to see a mexican restaurant opening in the area, but this is super underwhelming (not to mention pricey).",
