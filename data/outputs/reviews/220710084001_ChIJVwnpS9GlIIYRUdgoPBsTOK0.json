Then we ordered. 12oz Ribeye to split with each having our own 8oz Lobster Tail.  We chose the Onion Strings and Sweet Potato Souffl\u00e9 both very good, Souffl\u00e9 could have been our dessert.  Onion Strings went to waste not because they weren\u2019t good it was just too much food and we had to focus on the Steak and Lobster.  Was disappointed because I was too full to have dessert they had 2 of my favorites I would have loved to have tried.  Bread Pudding with no raisins and Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. We don\u2019t spend this much at dinner too often so I kept reading reviews on several places and decided on this one.  So glad I made the right choice.",

We made reservations and the restaurant was empty we got there while it was opening. The hostess lady looked us over a few times then placed us in the corner. When my husband asked the waitor Jimmy for another table he claimed all the others were taken.. even though all table were open but they promptly placed the white patrons at the open tables. It kind of soured the entire visit and I was disappointed in Mr. Johns. It's 2020 you guys. And don't think people of color don't notice the change in treatment and service. My husband and I are both professionals holding several degrees between us. Treat everyone with respect and dignity regardless of skin tone. The food was just alright, if there was a taste test between them and longhorn steakhouse I wouldn't know the difference. A big let down bc my husband and I have been wanting to check this place out for a while now. I'm sure the restaurant will comment with a robotic response but seriously guys....listen.",

I'm used to \"Ruth Chris Steakhouse\" where the steak is seasoned and I need nothing  else with it. Mr. John's only season with salt and pepper as stated on the menu. Welp, I guess my cousin missed that part when she told me this place was New Orleans' version of my favorite steakhouse. Not so, this place doesn't compair. Now I must say the service was EXCELLENT and for that I will rate this place 2/5 even though I wasted $70 on dinner that I didnt enjoy.",

We spoke with them  outside after and his fingers were blistering. Upon talking to the manager about it,the  manager proceeded to yell at this gentleman. Enough so that other patrons could hear what was going on. The discussion got very heated. And rather than show concern for this customer the manager blamed him and said that he was warned that the plate was hot. The gentleman was told that it was taken directly out of the broiler and given to him. Having worked in the restaurant industry for many years, it is common practice to transfer the hot food to a warming plate or put a plate underneath it to avoid such burns. Nothing should be served to a customer on a plate so hot that it causes blistering burns on your fingers. The manager did not handle it well. It was a very uncomfortable situation.",

It has an old school steak house feel, it reminded me of Crescent City Steaks, just more modern. It's so disheartening and disrespectful in 2019 to still deal with blatantly different service in a fine dining establishment due to race (it was the only difference between us and the other restaurant patrons). Especially in a city whose main economic draw is tourism. Either they don't realize you notice it or maybe they just don't give a f\u00f7@%! I can only speak on the experience we had at this restaurant, if our treatment was due to something other than race we could not identify it. We dine out a lot, everything from holes in the wall to fine dining establishments and sadly this type of treatment is still very prevalent. We pride ourselves on being exceptional tippers 20% is our norm. I will tip a lackluster server no less than 15%. I tip this way because I understand they don't think \"we\" are tipping at all let alone tipping properly. Needless to say, we won't be back anytime soon. I will say we have dined at their sister restaurant Desi Vega and the service was amazing!",

It\u2019s a Friday night at 5:40 and we asked if we needed reservations and were told no. We proceed into the restaurant ten minutes after opening and mind you just a couple tables were being used were told that since we didn\u2019t have a reservation it would be 9:15 before we could get a table. We then went out to our concierge at our Wyndham resort explaining our situation they immediately called Houston restaurant to see if we could get in and they said of course. We went there had a fabulous meal along with great music and a great vibe. As you can see I don\u2019t leave reviews except when needed. So anyone staying on St. Charles in New Orleans go to the Houston restaurant. Stellar.",

All of the food was great except for one filet that did not taste right that they had to remake. From the beginning the the manager wasn't kind or friendly about it but rather rude. Then it took 30-45 minutes to get the steak remade and by that time the rest of the party had finished their meals and half the party had left. I'm upset because I wanted to like this  restaurant as new alternative to Ruth Chris and Crescent City Steakhouses. When we paid we told the waiter that we knew it wasn't his fault and he was kind of rude about that but, thats what happens when someone does not a good leader to look up to.  I think this restaurant has great potential but needs a new manager.",

The waiters & staff were courteous, gave excellent service, and were attentive... Although I expect all of the above at any fine dining establishment. I had the surf & turf for my entree. The lobster was perfection; however, the steak lacked flavor of any sort. I would highly recommend a topping for any of their steaks if one chooses to dine here. Originally I wanted the steak without any additions as multiple friends had raved how good their steaks were & I wanted to taste this experience too. My fianc\u00e9 had the cowboy steak and was disappointed with the quality as well. I feel there are far better establishments in NOLA for steak. The prices seemed inflated as the rating on Google for their restaurant. Look elsewhere for date night.",

I ordered a blackened ribeye, but received a New York Strip.  As the waiter placed the dish in front of me, he said out loud \"here's the blackened ribeye.\"  There is no confusing the two cuts -for me, or for a server working in a steak restaurant.  He assumed I was ignorant.  He intentionally lied about his error.  However, the steak was perfectly medium rare -as I ordered it.  The tiramisu was ordinary. The chocolate torte was rich. The coffee was good.  On pricing, the steaks are all near $40.  The meal above with an ice tea and two cocktails was $147 before the tip.",

Bill was over $250, too much for the wait. I didn't begrudge the $250, I begrudged the wait. This is a lazy and rude group. I live in NOLA, and this is not the way of the New Orleans restaurant tradition of good service and friendliness.",
