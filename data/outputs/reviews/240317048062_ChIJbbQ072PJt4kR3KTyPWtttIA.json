The restaurant itself reminded us of a bistro you would see on the corner of a street in downtown Paris. The brunch menu was excellent - difficultly selecting among many desirable menu items is a great problem to have for sure. We also really enjoyed the service - the food came out fresh and quickly and our server, who's name was Elliot I believe, was very friendly. We really enjoyed our visit and are excited to go back sometime soon. The only thing I would say that we did not like was that the price for their food, especially breakfast food, was very high comparatively and many of their entrees did not come with sides so you have to pay and order for those separately. Aside from an above average price, their food and service were great.",

A decent wine list, but can't speak to beers as didn't order any. Small plates to start were creative and delicious. I enjoyed the duck sausage. Mains were also well prepared with seasonal purees and sauces decorating the plates. I had the duck breast which arrived just as I ordered it, medium-rare. Tried fries from a friend - crisp and well seasoned. He didn't like the burger however, but that is partially his fault for ordering it well done, it came out dry but what do you expect with ground chuck. Desserts were well made and delicious. Overall a good experience. Not a place for the price conscious person.",

They were polite but not in an overly fancy way that makes you feel like some kind of royalty from the 1800s. It was just perfect and one of the best wait staffs I've ever experienced. I felt respected but they were also fun and not cookie cutter humans: the restaurant allowed them to be themselves with style of clothing, piercing and exposure of tattoos.  Now for the food and drink. I got some kind of daily special cocktail that I don't remember the name of, but it was a deliciously perfect mix. For my meal I had the scallops with Israeli couscous and it was fantastic. The Israeli couscous is larger and smoother which was a perfect fit for this dish instead of regular couscous. The scallops were cooked well, and the puree and sparing use of green apple was a great blend. It was surprising but tasted like it all belonged together. Really complimentary flavors and I would absolutely get this again. I could not stop eating this dish!",

As a bit of a duck fan, it did not have a flavor, tenderness, or texture consistent with the idea that dry aged normally conveys. We also had the halibut special. For being a special, it was just fish. We shared the pappardelle and duck pasta, and it lacked seasoning. I also found the pasta tough, most likely overworked in the dough phase.  However, the steak tartar was great. We also had the smoked scallop ceviche and it was also very nice. The smoke is more of an aroma than a flavor.  The staff was very nice and friendly. We were the first table of the evening, and everyone at one point helped serve us in some form.  I recommend having a reservation, as even though we started as the only guests, they were very concerned about us not having a reservation. They also limit you to 2 hours at your table.",

The only thing that could be improved it's the portion size verses pricing (particularly in entrees where amounts of garnishes dis-proportionally small in the ratio to protein part of the dish). SERVICE: was very nice, efficient and professional AMBIANCE: cozy, comfortable, but a bit too loud when a full house for keeping a conversation. VALUE: a bit higher then it should be considering the portion sizes, but because of the quality of the food probably not high enough to scare customers away. CONCLUSION: when in Bethesda worth coming back.",

Our reservation was at 8 PM and our table was running a little behind, which is fine, no big deal. The bar is so small that we could not even squeeze in to grab a drink because people were already on top of each other so we decided to wait for our table instead. I used to work as a waitress for 8 years and between sideworks and taking care of my clients I know what being busy means, but this time, our waiter had zero sense of time or attention. He came in to our table, nice and polite, maybe a little too excited but still, friendly and amicable. He introduced himself and he was never to be seen until dessert time. I had to physically grab another waitress who was standing at the bar to take our order after we already received our 1st round of drinks and that was 40 min later. Our original waiter came back to check on us and he was sweating bullets. We saw him talk to the chef in the kitchen the whole time and I am guessing it was so hot out there that when he came out on the floor he was drenched, very unappealing for a waiter who is going to take care of your food and drinks. He said he was going to change our silverware but never did. And he vanished again. I then grabbed another waitress to get our dessert order because no one checked on us. Meanwhile, we were watching the staff, including our waiter, taking selfies between the bar and the kitchen. At that point, we could have just left, but it was my friends birthday so I really wanted her to get some dessert, at least. The food was not that great. She had the risotto and it was way too salty, so she returned it and I shared my crab salad with her instead. We did not want to wait another 40 min to get our food. Dessert came, and our waiter finally appeared after I waived at him. He offered a dessert on the house because of the food, which was kind of him to do but nevertheless, he was not around when we needed him. the dessert came, and honestly, it was not worth it at all. The profiteroles were good! but the other one was too dry. It could use more cream or sauce. The mille feuilles was too much and too dry. Anyways, I would not go back to that place. It's nice and cozy but not worth my time and money. Pour mes compatriotes Francais, je ne recommande pas de manger dans ce restaurant. La qualitee alimentaire n'est pas de hauteur et le service, ben n'en parlons surtout pas. Bonne chance a vous si vous decider d'y mettre les pieds. Peut etre le bar lui meme serait le mieux sinon.",

I had a cucumber crab salad which was great..  The cucumber and seasoning was light and added to rather than masked the crab.  I also had a aged duck breast, which was also great.

A bit on the small side for someone with an appetite, but it was cooked well.  My friends had the Tournedos and had no complaints.

But they were out if it. In fact, from six or so entrees, they were out of two.. You need a magnify glass to find a mash potato, which was a part of my dish. Scallops for 28$ was a plate of probably 3 large scallops, which were cut on several pieces and arrange in circle on the plate, with a few broccolino (?) (a fancy for the broccoli) pieces . And on the empty middle of plate, the parsley sauce was poured\u2026 Even I do not need much food, I was absolutely hungry after that meal and got some chicken from my friend\u2019s plate ($24, but was tasty enough with a good size). The waiter absolutely didn\u2019t care that my friend barely touched her fish dish. He just asked \u201care you done\u201d and took the plate. Cheese plate - $18 for 3 small pieces of cheese with one cherry tomato, one strip of the marinated mushroom and a slice of marinated onion\u2026. In short, 4 least expensive entrees, with a tiny cheese plate, and two glasses of white wine cost us $168 (without tips). So, after a $200 dinner, we being still hungry went to the Italian place nearby and enjoy a tasty, but not pretentious food for the fraction of costs. With so many nice places around, it was a huge mistake to come there (strong wind and sudden cold weather stopped us for going somewhere else after we sat down)",
