Be fore dinner had a few cocktails and the bartender knew what he was doing. My bride had a Manhattan and I had a Rob Roy. Both drinks were perfect. My better half had the butternut squash soup and Beef Wellington. Loved it. I had the duck breast. Yummy. Had the bread pudding for dessert. Was okay. Not my favorite. Overall a nice dining experience.",

Every time anyone ordered anything, the server disconsolately polled us to see who actually wanted what they'd brought. After the fourth time this happened, I was pretty over it.  The food was great. I enjoyed the meal I ordered, and I'd go back after we've all had a chance to recover from the changes brought in by the pandemic.  Decent beer selection, but I wish they had some brews in tap.",

When looking at my google map I saw this well rated place and thought the history of it sounded interesting. After dining here, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it and was surprised it had such good ratings. Our experience just didn\u2019t have the feel of a one time deal. First and foremost the service was terrible and very slow. Keep in mind we were there clearly after the noon rush (if it exists for this place) and there were maybe 6 tables besides our own. When asked about why our order of 3 basic meals (one being a special) was not on our table after 45+ minutes, the server was rude and unapologetic. To bring it in to perspective, 2 tables that came in after us were served (including dessert) and gone before we got our food. Once we received the food, it didn\u2019t get better. The server got one order completely wrong and the food was mediocre tasting. The drink refills weren\u2019t even done correctly. I wasn\u2019t impressed with the interior of the restaurant either, as it seemed dark and run down. The whole situation seems to need help, especially if you\u2019re going to classify yourself as a fine-dining, classic kind of place. So, if you\u2019re visiting Springfield I would highly suggest getting food elsewhere!",

Do so at your own risk as the service quality goes down when you are out of sight.  Bread and grated cheese was brought to the table after we sat. Olive oil was not. Just a little difficult to have the cheese with the bread when no oil is provided.  Don't order a medium rare prime rib at 7:30 on a saturday night. Yes, I know it was a risk. But I would also hope that an update would be provided telling me that med rare was no longer an option. It definitely came out at medium or just a touch higher.  It should not take 24 minutes to get a piece of Queen of Sheba for dessert. It was taken off the check but good grief!  Generally a fine place to have a wonderful meal. The ball was dropped during this visit. They will only get one more chance from me.",

The place needs some sprucing up; not with the decor but the place smelled musty. By the time we left, my nose and head were stuffed up. The food was good, my steak was over cooked but my husbands\u2019 steak was cooked perfectly. The waitstaff and receptionist were very friendly and polite. My husband called after he made the reservation and had them place a single rose at the table, which they did gladly and I was surprised by it. Next time we are down there, we are going to have lunch, (which I prefer that menu instead of the dinner menu), since my husband is not a seafood person. They have a lot of seafood appetizers and dishes on the dinner menu.",

I was able to have their French Onion soup and their Monte Cristo sandwich. The french onion soup was top notch - what you would expect from this unique soup. The Monte Cristo - fan-freaking-tastic. It was actually the first Monte Cristo I had ever had and I will be disappointed in any future Monte Cristos from other establishments if they are not of this caliber.
