In sum, I will definitely recommend this place.",

After spending 300$ I had food poisoning that night and haven\u2019t recovered 2 days later. Not to mention the server was not very welcoming. We wanted more information about the food and wine but she kept talking about the price point. I think we can afford it since our bill was $300 and still tipped 20% because we felt bad that the restaurant business isn\u2019t doing well as is due to the pandemic. I wouldn\u2019t return here.

As big fans of global street food, my girlfriend and I struggled to order as every dish sounded incredibly appetizing.  You absolutely HAVE to get the tempura elotes - they're the most popular item and a menu staple for good reason. The muhamarra was my personal favorite - even as someone who does not love pomegranates, this dish was phenomenal.  The scallops and khanom krok were both good, I would recommend the latter if you are looking for something a bit heavier.  The two of us chose to split 4 small plates  and one dessert and left satiated but not stuffed. Service was attentive and the ambience was great. I would love to come back, and intend to visit its sister restaurant Sepia very soon!",

The flavor combinations in all of the dishes were so bold and complex and inventive!! The tempura elote was such a fun and delicious concept. The baby octopus was charred and crunchy and tasty. The broccoli salad and the yellowtail dish were highlights because they were bursting with flavor and were so unique. The pork shank was my least favorite because I am not the biggest fan of the flavor of anise/five spice, but overall it was still very well prepared. We had so much trouble narrowing down the menu because everything looked so good, but we chose well and will be back to try more items soon!!",

Once we finally got to our table, everything from the seating area (we got a really great spot) to the service to the Valentine course meals was exquisite. The music was just right to have a great conversation. Service was exceptional, having each meal plate replaced right away after we finished with a course, water refilled right away and overall a good explanation of the meals when we weren\u2019t sure what to get. The meals were out of this world, flavorful & unique! The menu was inspired with international options. Delicious, delicious, delicious! In addition, the dessert was so well chosen together that your taste buds were buzzing with smoothness and creaminess. Overall, recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to take their significant other to a upscale place with amazing food & service.",

Our reservations were for 8PM and they told us that the people at the table were paying and we would be seated shortly. The restaurant was not crowded and there were many empty tables.  We went to the bar and had a drink. I had the take on the old fashioned and it was well balanced. The highlight was actually Keep it spicy which is a non alcoholic drink. The spice of the ginger is magical. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for our table.  We finally got to the table and started to look at the menu. Our friends gave us some recommendations, but our waiter did not say anything. He did not offer suggestions or tell us how large or small the portions were. For starters we had the cauliflower Indian special, the burrata, and the elote. These dishes were the highlight of the meal. The cauliflower was super crispy and the sauce was so rich and flavorful with a hint of spice. The elote was crispy with a creamy corn flavor in the middle. The burrata was creamy and I liked the addition of the squash. It needed acid to cut the fat. The bread was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  We ended up ordering more drinks after the first courses and we waited around 15 minutes to get them. Our waiter never refilled our water glasses.  For the rest of the meal, we had the mussels and coal oysters. The mussels were great. The broth was bold and flavorful and I like the addition of the saltines of the sausage. The oysters should not happen. They were torched, but had no flavor. The oysters were cooked and were very one note. It ended up being a weird texture.  We also had the lamb chops, which were cooked perfectly. The raita could have been seasoned more. The pork shank fell off the bone, but the sauce was too sweet. It had a great heat, but finished sweet. We could have done away with the pork. We had no idea how large the portions were and it ended up being a lot of food for us and our friends ordered more.  There were some dishes that were more successful than others. For the price of the meal, the service did not match it. I wouldn\u2019t come back again because nothing really popped, the food or the service.",

Came solo after a long day on a business trip and had a truly excellent experience from top to bottom. Huge comfortable table at the bar, kind and prompt service and fantastic ambience.  And then there\u2019s the food. The tempura elotes were good. The yellowtail and pomelo salad was, without exaggeration, divine. Each bite delivered rich and complex flavors and the portion was extremely generous. Closed strong with the Thai Mussels, which were also fantastic. Another very generous portion, with a nice side of sticky rice so that none of the sauce went to waste.  What satisfies me the most was the shockingly reasonable prices of everything, including cocktails. For one of the best restaurants in the city, it might also be one of the best values for the variety and power of the flavors you\u2019re getting in each dish. My only regret is I didn\u2019t bring more people with me so I could try more.",

There were two of us and we picked four different plates and that was enough for us, though we could have gotten one or two more and been full. We chose the red lentil hummus, carrot salad, scallops, and the black pepper pork. Everything was incredible.  The only drawback to this place, for me, was the seating; there isn't much room between tables and it feels very cramped. It was difficult to get to the seat on the inside (the booth seat).  Other than the seating, which I didn't feel was important enough to drop a star, this place is amazing and I will definitely go back.",

From there we proceeded to the kitchen counter (a product of a late reservation, but an awesome vantage point!) for dining. Our servers helped explain the menu, but being able to observe the food being created helped us make the best decisions, lol.",

Proxi is reviews were good and, after having travelled through Spain, we loved the idea of an eclectic mix of small plates. The tempura elote was awesome! All the flavors of Mexican street corn but in a pillow of air! Best dish was the mussels and Thai sausage in a spicy broth with basil and lemongrass. We had several other tastings and the only dish that somewhat disappointed was the jerk chicken as the meat was a bit over cooked, but overall a delightful evening with a taste for everyone!Staff was very attentive and helpful with the menu- a nice pre theatre dine or just getting together with friends.",

My party of three ordered the recommended 2 or three dishes per person which included the whole fish(A delicatable white fish) the scallops, a fried mushroom dish, the steak, the pork shank and a round of custom made house cocktails. The meal for three was around $300 which to be honest being from LA I thought was extremely reasonable especially since my party ordered 4 cocktails which locally would usually add about $100 dollars to the tab. Not being from Chicago I might be understating the obvious but parking was attrocious and the Valet while extremely nice took me 20 minutes to track down.  Service was exceptional our waiter and support staff were on top of there game. Again I blame this on our lack of local knowledge but we arrived dressed for a Michelin resteraunt and were surprised to find local attire drofted towards the casual. The food was excellent all the way around and while our waiter was extremely accommodating he slightly over reccomended on dishes. Having said that the menu layout was divine with larger sized dishes being at the bottom of the menu and smaller at the top. Most of the \"savory\" plates listed on the far right of the menu like the whole fish and the steak are legitimately large enough portions to be considered a main course. Overall the experience was good with me reserving that final star becuase my expectations for a Michelin star resteraunt here in LA is extraordinary and this didnt wuite hit that level. But then again neither did the prices as locally I would expect to pay 30 or 40% more.",

They were a bit sweet for my taste, although to be fair I didn't ask for less sweet drinks (I normally do). We were thinking of ordering dessert but ended up not having to order dessert because the drinks were sweet and delicious enough to count as dessert for us.  The interior of the bar/restaurant was very fashionable and visually interesting. We chose to sit in the middle of the restaurant where there is a section enclosed with curtains. We were seated in posh MCM chairs which were very comfortable and probably very expensive.  Service was friendly, professional and prompt. The bar was pleasantly busy, but we still had our choice of where to sit.",

I wouldn't put it on the same level as some of the other similarly priced restaurants in the neighborhood, like Girl and the Goat. But my meal was absolutely fantastic.  The restaurant specializes in street food, the focus is on latin and asian cuisine. Everything is small plates and shareable.  First, the place just oozes style. I need to figure out what spotify playlist they're using, because I could not stop vibing to the music. It's not loud music by any stretch, but it's just the right volume for you to hear it and enjoy it without being obtrusive. And the interior is just very well decorated. It's weird to say, but I felt cool by just being there.  Second, the service was very good. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and gave strong recommendations.  Third, the food was really really good. Like I said, it's small plates, and they aren't cheap. If you're drinking, you should expect to spend close to $100 for a meal for two. But if you're looking for a cool and interesting place to have a great meal for a date night... I definitely recommend Proxi.",

I found the menu and plates confusing for a table of six. Our waitor recommended the number of plates to order and a few plates that were popular.  Many of them were difficult to share, such as an entire fish or crepe. It ended up being a very messy experience trying them out.  Service was just ok. Plates did not come out with utensils so we ended up having to scoop things out with already used utensils. Curry is definitely not something to get into other plates! Took quite some to get it check after dessert.",

The waiter was very helpful and provided good recommendations. Generally the service was good although did get slightly less attentive toward the end of the evening.  We started with a couple cocktails that we enjoyed, and then my husband switched to wine and I ordered one of their more unique gin and tonics. I didn't love it and wouldn't order one again.  For food we largely went with some of the recommendations. For two of us we ordered 7 dishes to share and one dessert. That felt like the right amount. We enjoyed the roasted broccoli, smoked pumpkin, and short rib dishes in particular. The burrata was okay (wouldn't order again) and I didn't love the lamb kabob. The flan dessert was also good even though I don't love pineapple.  Overall a good choice for food and a lively atmosphere.",

The sesame leaves was a perfect contrast to the sweetness of yellowtail. The most unimpressive was the duck dumpling, it didn't taste anything like duck. We ordered the egg tart as dessert, because it was the most out of the ordinary. It was really good with matcha and jam. You only get 3 quarters of the tarte though. We joked that because there was only 3 of us.  We took their suggestion ordering 3 plates for each person, so we got 9 plus dessert. It was not enough for the 2 with bigger appetite and a lot for the small eater. So I'd think most men would wanna order more than we did.  Friendly and attentive staffs. The decors are very simple, modern and minimalistic, it has a cold and sleek feeling. Actually it felt like walking in high end men clothing store. There were mostly businessmen there too.",

But, what we now have is a NEW Favorite Restaurant!!  The atmosphere is kind of jazzy and laid back especially if you dine in the lounge area. But the food and customer service are what make this place phenomenal! The manager, Valerie, is just amazing...and our server, Steve, was awesome! I would say this is not a family or kid-friendly restaurant as the setup and menu are more on the exotic side. I can't wait to bring my husband here to try it. The overall experience is like no other.",
