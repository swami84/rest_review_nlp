After a craving for this food once the weather cooled off a bit, we decided to order the usual suspects to find out that the price had increased on our order by over $8 for the same dishes.  Upon dining, the food was incredibly bland and not anywhere near the quality that we had experienced a few months ago. There was nothing special or remotely similar to the delicious food we have experienced here in the many visits in the past which was quite disappointing. I completely understand price increases in this time, but that in combination with the reduced quality of the food will likely mean that we search for another go-to spot. I hope this was a one off scenario, but in reading recent reviews it seems that this has been occurring much more frequently as of late.",

The Vegetable Curry was ok, it was just tomatoes and onions crushed up together with some red chili powder. I cook a lot of Indian food, so I could tell that they had just thrown random spices in there. The Garlic Naan was hard and tasted bitter bc the garlic pieces were either burned/ stale. The Mango Lassi was on the sweeter side, but good enough. After eating just a little bit of this  dinner, I had a TERRIBLE stomach ache. I tried it again the following day and the same result. I wonder if it\u2019s the Amchur/Chat Masala spices they seem to use as their curry base?  The only reason I give 2 stars is for: 1) Quick delivery time for Indian food (30 mins) 2) Big proportions, with lots left over for 2 more servings",

It started with a couple of stale chicken dishes. I still thought it was a one off due to the covid situation. Then, every item, I would order would be old and stale or bland! And the things that I used to frequently order and knew for a fact were good.. I am just sad that the food quality has worsened and that I won't be ordering anymore.",

If you've never had South Indian food I HIGHLY recommend the dosa, it comes with a soup called sambar that's so good and the best chutneys. If you want to branch out the rasam, idli, and khaman are really good. I look forward to trying more stuff. The best part is even the stuff that's more popular in US Indian restaurants is also really really good- butter chicken and the butter dosa are top notch. I can't wait to try more here.",

All of our food orders were put in at the same time. Half of the food was brought out, and then no one came back for about 20 to 30 minutes. It was really awkward having half of the people without food and half of the people feeling uncomfortable eating but worried their food would get cold otherwise. The four that had food had all ordered curries but the naan wasn't brought out until the second half of our order came. We also were out of water so the people that were able to get started eating did not have water (more of a problem for those with spicy food). In that 20-30 minute gap no one came over to give us a status update or even apologize so there was a lot of confusion. It was honestly bizarre.",

Now, if you want the taste of exotic spices and flavors that will make you think that you are sitting at a Indian restaurant in New Delhi, then Mild 2 Spicy is the place for you. The curries are delicious, and you can adjust your heat level, without sacrificing spice and flavor. My son can't handle any heat in his food, and he devoured his mild Chicken Tikka Masala. I, on the other hand, love spice and heat. I ordered a Chicken Vindaloo that made me cry with joy and heat with every bite. It wasn't like they just added more chili powder to make it spicy, they somehow balanced the extra heat and the spices to create a party in my mouth.  Another thing that this restaurant does, and other cheap out on, is give you delicious fragrant basmati rice with your meal, without charging extra. How can you eat a Indian curry without rice? To complete the dinner, they have an amazing selection of Indian breads from naan to paratha, puris and rotis.  One thing I must mention, is that you have to try the Pani Puri cocktail. It's a delight of spice, salt, sour and sweet in a delicious drink. I will warn you, that just one will not be enough.  The prices here are very reasonable, and the portion sizes pretty much guarantees that you will have enough for lunch the next day.  Dang it, now I'm hungry just think about the food. I guess I know where I'm going this weekend!",

The desert items were limited but they had masala tea. Service was fine and I think the $15 for the buffet was appropriate.",
