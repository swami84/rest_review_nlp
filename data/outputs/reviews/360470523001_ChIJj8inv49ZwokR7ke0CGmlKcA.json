He told me it would not be there for at least two days, once when I had already received notice it was there from UPS. I went back two days later to pick it up and they were closed (despite saying they were open on google). I went back the following day and they were still closed (again despite saying they were open on google). When i went back for the FOURTH time, the owner told me that he had sent back my package because it has been sitting there too long. It went against UPS policy of them holding for at least 5 business days. He told me to calm down in a very rude manner.",
