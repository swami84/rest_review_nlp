The next day, he made a call and told him to work again because of a problem. It's a place where people ridicule and play around is amazing. Parking was not available, so on full-time working days, they picked up before and after work. You only make $10 (and you have to pay tax), but the conclusion is that even on a day of making $50 a day, you have to ride the bus for 1 hour (different from the initial promise). There is no politeness.
