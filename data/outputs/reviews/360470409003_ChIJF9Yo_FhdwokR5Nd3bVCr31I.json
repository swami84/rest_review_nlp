Whomever designed the storefront knew what they were doing.  The hostess/barista/manager(?) was very pleasant and very accommodating. There are a lot of menu options including some interesting fried rice bowls with a distinct asian (Phillipino) influence. I had the Tapsilog bowl which was pretty solid although I didn't realize that it came with a runny egg (I'm not a fan don't judge me lol). The hostess was happy to adjust and hard fry it for me. I appreciated the effort. I washed the bowl down with some Thai iced tea.  At the time of our visit the espresso machine was still being installed but they were able to get my friend a latte instead. I'm sure they've got all of that up and running by now.  The menu is wide ranging. They've got seats out front. Alternate side parking is available. I think I'll be back to sample the rest of their options. You should come with! It's worth it I promise.",
