The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the food&Drinks were amazing! Appetizer: - Camarones y ajo: LOVED the sauce the shrimp was in I used the complimentary bread and dipped it in this sauce I had to eat it all it was so good. - Ceviche (fish) I loved what it was garnished with It was some type of nut, hominey, and vegetables. THe fish tasted really fresh and it was delicous. - Tostones: CANNOT go wrong ordering this it goes with literally everything. Main: - Pollo Saltado: So I am usually a big fan of \"Lomo\" saltado the steak version of this plate but I decided to do the chicken version and it was amazing! The spanish rice they paired with it went perfectly. - Salmon: My colleague had salmon and she loved it the portion was huge she had to bring half home i had a small bite but I thought it was seasoned fantasically. - We each had red sangria and that was FANTASTIC. - Pisko Sour was also delicious. I will be coming back to try the Lomo saltado and a few other items on the menu that I didnt get a change of trying.",

Couple things: come hungry, they're not skimping on the meat, and it's freakin delicious. I've never had a more tender flank steak, ever. Also, if you've never had blood sausage or sweetbreads, now's your best opportunity without having to travel south of the equator. Both also really good. Oh yeah, appetizers. Don't think about it, just order the croquettes...and the ceviche if you want variety. Finally, they make a great Pisco Sour, so have one of those before the wine.",

(There's even a vegan selection of dishes!) As an Uruguayan myself, the chivito was always going to be the acid test for this place, and it did not disappoint. Tasted just like home, at a reasonable price point. 10/10 would recommend. Will come back to try their milanesas and grilled meats.  ***UPDATE*** Went back on a Saturday for lunch. Had the chivito (irresistible), the steak milanesa napolitana, and the chaj\u00e1 for dessert. Once again, everything was fantastic. Ideal weekend vibe, too. The first time was clearly not a fluke\u2014best kept secret in DC! Keep it up \ud83d\udcaf",

The cerviche was a delicious, plenty to share. The ChorizoPan was huge, I took half home. The yuca was so good, I wish they served a bigger portion, but truthfully, I didn't finish my sandwich so I cannot complain. Awesome place, can't wait to go back to try dessert!",
