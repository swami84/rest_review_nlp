Favorites: Tiger Cry, Pad See Ew, Cashew Chicken. But the clear standout is their potstickers... literally some of the best ever, with just the right mix of filling and dough. We've been known to just get several orders of these for dinner.  My only criticisms: 1) the chicken in every dish is \"rubbery\" and, 2) the spice levels can vary radically from one order to the next: medium spicy can be sweet and bland sometimes and burn your mouth another.",

I also ordered Pad See-iew, and maybe I\u2019m too picky but the wide rice noodles are the heart of the dish for me - the texture and the way they caramelize a bit is the best part. Instead for some reason the restaurant substituted thin rice noodles, didn\u2019t tell me, and it was really just not the same. I would rather be given the chance to change my order than receive something that isn\u2019t what I ordered. The thin noodles stuck together in clumps, the flavor was ok but very inconsistent across the dish. As others have pointed out, the portion size here is not very generous for the cost which I wouldn\u2019t even think about if the food was quality, but it wasn\u2019t so it can\u2019t be explained away by \u201caverage food but you get a ton!!\u201d, there were only a few pieces of vegetable (you can see it all in the photo). The tofu was acceptable but only that, it completely lacked the flavor of the dish. I don\u2019t think I will give this place another chance until I\u2019ve tried more options in Lincoln Square or indoor dining is back to normal. I definitely can\u2019t recommend and won\u2019t be ordering the Pad See-iew again unless the restaurant confirms that is not how it\u2019s normally made, and tonight was a fluke. I came on a friend\u2019s recommendation so maybe it was an off night :(",

Cute decor, great tables to work on, they play really good music and it's not too loud- I was able to hop on all of my work calls here quite easily. They also have wildly clean and nice bathrooms, which I really appreciate!  Secondly, the menu looks absolutely delicious. I had the Turkish coffee and the golden mylk latte which was especially delightful!! There are at least four more drinks on the menu that I can't wait to come back and try! I'm so impressed with their extensive list of house-'made nut milks! Again, I want to try them all! I didn't get any food, but their superfood options look delicious, healthy and filling.

I can take a lot of heat but don\u2019t prefer a dish so hot that that\u2019s all you experience.  There are people out there that cannot take any heat (so probably just stick to casseroles and pass up Thai altogether) but for those who cannot stand a lot, the heat level for their dishes are off.  If you order mildly spicy, it\u2019s enough heat for a slight burn.  Medium spicy, forget it; it\u2019s comparable to regular spicy at most Thai places.  So beware on the spice levels.  On two different occasions I tasted the Pad Thai and it was quite bland.  Pad Thai sauce consists of fish sauce (salty), tamarind paste (sour) and sugar (sweet).  It tasted like the sauce was omitted altogether.  It was just noodles, egg, carrots and peanuts.  No green onion or bean sprouts.  They also need a lesson on how to slice meats.  The chicken in the pad thai and beef in the panang were tough because they weren\u2019t sliced correctly, which is against the grain. The result was very toothsome beef and chicken which took away a pleasant food experience.  The panang has good flavor but was too thin with coconut milk. Panang curry is known for being a thick curry so this was actually just a straight red curry.  Prices are somewhat higher than some better Thai establishments in the area.",

We paid full price and left all of the food.  -The seafood platter had no flavor and the sauce was gelatinous. The crab was fake and squishy, the shrimp tasted like nothing. The noodles were the only things with flavor, but unfortunately, they were glued together in a lump. It seemed microwaved.  -The spring rolls were COVERED in another gelatinous sauce and were room temperature and flavorless.  -The Tom Kha Kai soup was just coconut milk, a TON of lemon flavor, and rubbery chicken that tasted greasy and old. No veggies, no onions, just lemon flavored, salty soup.  -The only thing that was edible was the chicken wing plate, and really just because they were fried and there wasn\u2019t much to them.  Why open a restaurant if you\u2019re going to offer food that seems like no care was put into it?? Sorry, guys, but the experience overall was just awful. Our server was nice, but that was it.",
