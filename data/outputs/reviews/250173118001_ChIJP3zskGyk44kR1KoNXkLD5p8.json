I kindly asked for a mocha iced and the guy had just finished tying a trash bag, didn't wash his hands and proceeded to make my drink. The mocha bottle was empty so he found a new one opened it and instead of adding the pump he poured it into the cup filled it to about a 1/4 to 1/3 of the way added the coffee and milk and handed it to me. Although I knew he was in the wrong. Another gentleman approached me to complete my transaction wasn't in a uniform and I kindly asked if my drink could be remade. He asked why I explained and he proceeded to tell me that's how the drink is made.  So yup I am not too happy and of coarse I am a usual customer of Dunkin donuts of coarse I know how my drink is made. Also as a business owner in the hospitality/service industry I would not stand for such carelessness.",
