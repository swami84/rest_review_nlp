He countined to yell at us. My partner asked him to stop yelling at her and stated she is a women, stop calling me buddy. Despite her request, he countined. He then countined to pace and stare at us through the window. Needless to say - we made our stop at Bone's after moving our car, but did not order and never will. Wish I could give zero stars.

They also have a great selection of Local, Italian, and classic NY Deli specialties (Sauces, imported tomatoes, Spiedie Chips!) and tons of baked goods or desert options. They do a great job of following the current COVID Guidelines and I haven't seen any change in quality since it has started.  This is one of the most welcoming businesses I've been to in Roc and it's obvious every person behind the counter puts a lot of care into what they do. They are proud of the product they put out and will make sure you are happy. All of this at a price of ~$11 a sub, it's such an amazing value and we're lucky to have them here!",

They're so big you can barely bite into it you literally have to eat it in sections lol....Plus the staff is the nicest group of people I've ever meet in my life no exaggeration and thats because they understand how a business should be run. I had a 12 sub order a half hour before they closed and they took the order no problem and they did it with a smile AND THEN THANKED ME!!! for the business. If that was any other sub shop in Rochester they would have been miserable af or turned me down, I've dealt with it before, trust me on this place, GO HERE!!! Well done Calabresella's keep up the great work!  P.S...I get the steak sub everytime it's absolutely amazing",
