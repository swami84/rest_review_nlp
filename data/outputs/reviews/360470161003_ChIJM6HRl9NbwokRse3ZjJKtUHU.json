Everything was delicious, from the Seafood Fried Rice (which had shrimp, scallops, and imitation crabmeat), to the Rack of Lamb, to the Dancing Eel Roll, their Sashimi, and their Salmon Skin Salad. Definitely worth the price. Quality is definitely great. This was ordered on a Sunday around 5 pm. Was recommended this place and was told delivery is fast so definitely a great reputation to have.",
