To my surprise and delight there were several gluten free options and the waitstaff was attentive and helpful with my diatary needs. And I asked for a salad as my side, but since the salad dressing wasn't gluten free they put together a simple gluten free dressing using gf soy sauce for me. I ordered the steamed tofu and vegetables over rice. The sauce they used was pretty good, and the tofu was silken and smooth. The reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because even after being seated we waited a very long time before they took our order, and people seated after us got served before we even got to order. Also my boifriend was given the wrong meal (ordered a curry bowl and an extra egg and was given a fried tofu bowl instead, and they forgot the egg too).",

My go-to is the Tampopodon, which has a generous portion of rice topped with a seaweed mixture and meat of choice, and their delicious spicy mayo on top. They also include a piece of broccoli and a piece of carrot, which I usually save for my \"dessert\" when I'm full. I get the white meat chicken with this dish, and it's always perfectly cooked.",

However, the woman there was very nice, and specially re-arranged all of the tables and chairs so we could all be together in such a tiny space!  I ordered the Pork Tampopo Don and shared the fried Octopus balls with a friend and they were both delicious and very filling too! Some of my friends tried the chicken teriyaki and curry that I maybe I'll try next time I go.  Aside from the driving nightmare that is Porter Square, there is a private lot for parking at Lesley University with very reasonable rates if you get your ticket validated for purchase of $10+. On the weekend I think it was $1.50 for 2 hours. We had to read the fine print and run back to the restaurant to get the lady to stamp all of our parking passes.",
