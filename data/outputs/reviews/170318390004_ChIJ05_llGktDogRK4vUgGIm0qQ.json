Very unprofessional from the majority of the working crew including management and owners! People who handle food during a PANDEMIC should take extra precautions while handling the food! NOT have their face masks off, not have their face masks below the nose and then talk when handling food, ESPECIALLY NOT touch their nose & face and then handle food that will later be sold to the public! When working with food, you should know the health risks and hazards of not following safety guidelines! I will NEVER again come to this restaurant! Overheard that the owner of this restaurant does not pay his employees! OWNER DISCRIMINATES! He steals from hard working employees! I do not support this type of behavior! I will definitely take my money and business somewhere else! As a business owner myself, I believe people need to be warned about the product/location they\u2019re supporting! Please take your money elsewhere! Support businesses that do NOT put their customers\u2019 health at risk, not discriminate against people, not steal from their employees, nor exploit their employees!",
