The best waiter there is the short Chinese guy who always greets you in English too or Chinese. I can speak fluent Cantonese. Sometimes waitress and waiters rely on tips and bring their China ways here which are very aggressive to ask for tips just like when they haggle with prices in China or drag foreigners to their stores to scam you. To all that eat here, if you want to tip ZERO due to poor service, you can. Do not feel threatened by the waitress to tip. I hope the manager sees this. The next time my girlfriend wants to eat here, I will complain to the manager. I would give 0/5 rating if I can. Food is overpriced here anyway from a Chinese person's perspective.",

The prices were decent and the food was good. However, after we had paid, and I tipped as much as I could afford, the waitress literally scoffed at it and asked for more. I added a little more, which was already stretching my budget, and she took it but arrogantly remarked that it should have been more. I did not get her name, but she was so rude that it ended the entire meal on a very sour note. Yes, I wish I could tip more, but tips are not supposed to be mandatory, and her asking for money just proved she did not deserve her tips.",

I didn't tip because at the moment, I cannot afford it, this lady kept pointing to the receipt and said \"you have to put something\" about 3 times. The first time was wen I signed it and gave it to her, the second was when I filled in the blank with $0 and the 3rd was when she told me to put the total and I did with the tip still being $0. I was forced to give her a tip, she would NOT leave our table until my friend gave her $3. NEVER AGAIN!",

It was a good meal, service was quick, price not too bad, and restaurant pretty clean.  I'm actually surprised I haven't tried this one before seeing that I'm probably in Chinatown once a week. The restaurant is actually quite spacious as I noticed a second level and has a full bar. For food, we tried the beef chow fun, some fish filet in garlic sauce (uber garlic-y, yums!), and a spicy pork chop. The noodles were solid and not too greasy (4/5). Fish filet in garlic sauce was my favorite and lots and lots of garlic (5/5). The spicy pork chop was good but what bothered me was how some pieces were overcooked and others were perfection (3/5).  Not a bad spot to hit and doesn't seem to draw the same amount of crowds as some of the other known spots throughout the Chinatown plaza. That's all I got for ya!  'Til next time.",

The spicy soup was very good with lots of kick for the hot/spicy food lovers. I tried the seafood delight because there was squid in it and that's something I haven't tried much. Ended up loving the texture and flavor of the squid. Shrimp was per usual and the crab was imitation which was no problem. Dish came with pan fried noodles that were crispy.  Service was above average on my opinion. Go check this place out if you want a oriental sitdown dining experience.  Try the seafood delight and spicy soup. CHEERS!",

This would not be my first pick, nor would i reccomend it. It's one of those \"Hey, have you tried this place before?\" And i would reply \"Yeah, it's okay, but if you haven't tried ~such place~ then i would go there instead.\" The tea wasn't the best and the smoothies weren't so great either. I had the pan fried noodles with bean sprout and bbq`d pork. The noodles didn't have much flavor and the pork was bland. Wish there was more bean sprout tbh. One thing i will say is that the servings are generous and the prices are good. Plus fresh crabs in the tank when you walk in. Major plus. \u2728",

They never check up unless you call them over and frequently forget food though they never forget to charge you for it,  and can be very rude. The first time we ate the the cha4ged a $60 tip, I paid tip in cash but left the tip spot blank on the receipt, (checked with bank) I thought maybe i had done it by mistake,  but after today all doubt has been removed. Wait staff was clearing out our table even though we were not done eating and demanded a 20% tip, and told us we were done eating, even though I told them not to take our plate, they gave us less food in take home boxes than what they actually took, told us we ordered alot of food, like that was a problem, were paying for it so didn't understand why she was so mad. Will definitely never be back and neither will anyone that has ever gone w us",

This visit my husband ordered the a platter with smelt, scallops and shrimp.

They also have your nontraditional dishes (orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc.) if that's what you're into. My family has been coming here for 15+ years to celebrate birthdays, graduations, or if we don't feel like cooking that night. I don't know why people are complaining about the service in the reviews because the service is fast and straight to the point. If you need something, just ask.. That's just how Chinese restaurants operate, fast and straightforward and that's how most restaurants are going to be like in Chinatown so get over it. Nobody is going to kiss your ass because you stepped into their restaurant. \ud83d\ude02",

My fish and vegetables food was warm, Not hot. My friends drink was sour instead of sweet, his beef and rice noodles was not cook per instructions. My wifes food was missing vegetables in her dish.  Very disappointed and would not recommend this fancy place.  The next day I informed the owners of the experience and the female owner was speaking Chinese to her husband to instruct him to send me away unaware that I speak Chinese as well. This is also after the waitress the night before insulted me stating I don't know what I'm talking about with the drinks because I'm Filipino when I'm Chinese as well, even after speaking Cantonese. Very rude staff and mediocre food, bad service.",

While we were ordering, My sister asked to switch out her white rice for fried rice and they would not allow that so we had to order extra. The customer service was also very poor. I asked the bartender if it's possible I could trade my pina colada for a beer and she slammed down her pen that was in her hand and said \"why? What's wrong with how I made it, this is how it's made\" I just said I was sorry I just didn't like it and she agreed to switch me for a beer but told me she wouldn't do it again. Also, Our waiter seemed irritated that we asked her to explain what was in some of the meals. Wouldn't come back here if my meal was free. Don't recommend coming here. Even their smoothies weren't good :(",

One of the problems we have is that we have found our favorite places in Chinatown, so we don't really venture out and try new places.  We were looking for desert, after dinner. We tried a bakery a few doors down from here and the cake was not very good. So we decided we needed a fresh watermelon drink to wash it down.  We walked up to check out the menu and a lady immediately opened a window and asked what we wanted. It was great and efficient. We did not even have to walk into the restaurant. We decided to grab a fresh watermelon smoothie. The lady went behind the bar and started making our drink.  We waited outside and our smoothie arrived very quickly. There is even a nice little shelf installed on the outside edge of the window. The prices were also great too. It was only $3 plus tax per smoothie. A few doors down there was another location and they were charging $4.45 plus tax per smoothie. That location was crowded. I wonder if these people knew they could save money a few doors down at this place.  The watermelon smoothie was really good. In fact, I don't think I've ever had a bad watermelon smoothie anywhere. It is always refreshing and delicious. So I am happy to say we have a new stop added on to our Chinatown visits. Plus you can't beat the price of the smoothies too.  Now it looks like this restaurant has a full menu. I can not comment on the food or what the experience is inside the restaurant. We only used the walk up window to grab a fresh fruit smoothie and that was a great experience.  I'm glad we now have a new stop now.",
