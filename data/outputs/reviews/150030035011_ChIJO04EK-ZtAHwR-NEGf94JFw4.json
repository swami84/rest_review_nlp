And I grew up in the midwest, so I have an extensive knowledge of bland food. Had I been blindfolded the only indication that it was pasta I was eating would've come from the texture. Couldnt taste the meat, noodles, cheese, nor the sauce. Virtually tasteless, in its own way it was kind of impressive. The cheese bread is definitely not worth $8 either as it resembles  the frozen \"New York garlic bread\" bread stick if you were to cut it in half, then 6 piece and sprinkle cheese over the top. Even then the frozen breadsticks have more flavor.  I really hope their other dishes have more flavor.",

She took them back to the cook, the kitchen is open and you can see everything.  The cook cuts off the burnt parts, throws it back in a pan and recooks. My son gets parts of the meatballs to eat.  We paid for the burnt pieces, the waitress shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  It was late and my son just wanted to eat and go home. The quality is not the same,  we ate there often but not anymore.  The customers keep the business running.  The business depends on contact with the public.",

I have mixed feelings about this place because some things were good, some okay and something's they need to work on.  Good! The bread is wonderful! Meat sauce is tasty Yummy cheesecake!  Okay: Sausage Spaghetti noodles...not quite aldente, but not overcooked  Need to work on: Angel hair pasta was overcooked Service could be better  If I come back, I'll probably try their pizza...",

Only 5 total tables of people the entire time I was there from the time we sat to the time we left.  Kind of sad for a Friday night.  The hostess was unpleasant and rushed to seat us so she could run back to her area and gonon her phone which she was on the whole night.  The waitress came to ask our drink order and my wife said diet Pepsi.  The waitress said 2 diet Pepsi's and I said yes I'll take a diet.  Then she said so 3 diets?  Made me think she was drunk.  I am a big guy and usually drink diet but I think she assumed I was getting a diet no matter what.  We then ordered an appetizer with the drinks.  5 minutes later we ordered our entrees.  15 minutes later our entrees came out and I asked about the appetizer and she said yes, one moment.  Then she came back a few minutes later and asked how the food was and said the appetizer is in the oven.  She forgot to put the appetizer order in, just apologize and move on.  At the end of the meal the appetizer came out.  The food was all good, I had the marsala chicken and the wife had chicken carbonara.  Halfway through the meal something started burning and smoke was filling the restaurant.   All the tables full of people, (all 3 of the tables) started looking around to make sure we were not in danger.  The smell and haze associated with burning food stayed the rest of the meal.  One table walked out witbout ordering thus resulting in loosing 30% of their customers.  I was upset they didn't ask if we still wanted the appetizer because it came out at the end of the meal.  I was upset and worried that they didn't address the burning, smoke and haze.  Last, everyone in there looked angry or unhappy to be at work.  Our waitress was nice, but she came off as either drunk or stupid and insensitive when assuming we both were getting diet drinks  Advice to management, hire better waitresses and hostesses.  They are supposed to be people people and nice.  If burning food happens often train staff to inform the patrons so they don't think there is a fire somewhere.",

Service is good but the food tends to take a little longer than average to reach the table so be sure you have plenty of time if you want to eat here! That said, the food is more of a local Italian flavor rather than authentic Italian. Portions are decent with a fair price. Pasta tends to be overcooked even when \"al dente\" is requested and plates tend to swim in sauce, which, only in a couple of dishes, is great.  I haven't tried any of their desserts so I can't speak to that.",

Terrible experience and I won't be visiting again.  Ordered the Ceasar salad, calamari appetizer and Chicken Parmesan a la vodka (which once upon a time was a trademark dish).  They didn't advertise a la vodka but they offered to make it when I ordered. I thought there was hope.  The Caesar salad was mediocre at best. Most likely store bought dressing with lettuce that was probably a day old. The salad had faint brown on its edges and has definitely been sitting for a while. The dressing was a little watery but flavorless. The croutons would have been a hit but a little soggy.  No ground pepper was offered.  The appetizer lacked the major player. The calamari. Plenty of onions, tomato and cheese and 12 pounds of butter buttttt three wedges of calamari.  The real disappointment was the entree. I basically got fried chicken tenders on fettuccini.  The a la vodka was anything but.  Very watered down but mostly flavorless.  The chicken batter was dark brown and slightly burnt. The meat was dry and flavorless.  The fettuccini was undercooked and I even showed the bright yellow and hard pasta to the waitress and she didn't have much input for resolution.  I ate the chicken fingers and the rest of the pasta went untouched.  The winner of it all was tho I didn't eat the pasta and even mentioned and showed it to the waitress - and I still got charged the extra fettuccine charge!!  I basically paid $30 for overcooked chicken fingers and a salad.  My suggestion is to find another Italian restaurant....... Way over priced and way underwhelming.",

They had light jazz playing in the background that was turned to the perfect volume, which matched the ambiance of the restaurant perfectly.  The building itself is perfect for an Italian restaurant.  It reminds me of something that you'd see in a movie.  I had an amazing experience, and i will definitely be returning.",

My husband and I eat there frequently and we haven't ventured to try another dish yet. We need to, but the lasagne is so hard to break away from and it's easily split between the two of us. It IS messy, but you don't eat lasagne with your hands do you? Either way you're going to use a fork, so it might as well be delicious and covered in their sauce.  Auntie Pasto's is a winner for sure. The staff is as friendly as can be. The restaurant has a very intimate layout. And I actually ENJOYED the fact that it was not freezing inside like most restaurants are. Top star establishment.  Mahalo!",

Seating was good...then it went downhill.... House Red Wine was like drinking Thunderbird. McDonalds makes a better salad. Main Course too much olive oil; and meatballs should be renamed breadballs.
