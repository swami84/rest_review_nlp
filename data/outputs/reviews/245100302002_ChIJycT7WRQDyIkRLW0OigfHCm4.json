This plus the fact that they obviously give you way too much rice so they can skimp on the vegetables/ protein. Also worth mentioning it's literally exactly the same as the food from Manchurian Rice Co.",

Popcorn chicken was great, recommend slightly less seasoning then these are a home run. The lemongrass grilled chicken bao was cooked perfectly and great taste. Only issue is the bao was soggy in places. My wife enjoyed her Sambal Chicken bowl. The pickled cabbage is awesome!

The first visit was nearly 30 minutes to receive a simple bao bun. Food itself was nothing special and was certainly overpriced which soured the experience that much more. Today it took 20 minutes to receive a few bubble teas. The tea itself was good but not worth my 20 minutes of waiting. While waiting for my tea, a man was talking to employees about being served raw meat in potstickers. I managed to catch a glance myself and they were indeed raw. I will take my business to better establishments that actually have quality product - Ekiben and Simply Sip Tea. This place is just banking on the popularity explosion of LA-styled asian food and boba without being the real deal. Avoid.",

        "caption": "I struggle between 2 - 3 stars for this. Lunch today was challenging. Our first outing here on their 2nd day open so I'll say they have room to improve. Taro boba tea was not bad but too much ice left it difficult to get the boba out and made my drink watered down in 10min. The ordering went quick and the food was ready fairly quickly. We sat upstairs at a comfortable round table with homey cushions and atmosphere. Our food was given in togo containers w/ lids and bags despite asking to eat in. I sampled a lot today: The pork & shrimp dumplings were amazing. This was the best thing on the menu by far. The popcorn chicken was a large portion with hearty dark meat but the breading was soggy. Maybe it shouldn't have been covered? Dipping sauce was spicy and excellent. The beef bulgogi was on the chewy side. The one piece I had wasn't bad, but my friend got tired of chewing thru the meal by the end. The teriyaki pork rib on bun was greasy and heavy with braised flavor. The portion size was good. The bun was a horrible mess and I couldn't finish it. It was rubbery like they microwaved the thing. It's offensive to call this wrap a bun because it was like a cheap pita wrapped around the meat. The buns need a total re-write. This one went to the trash. The veggie fried rice was an abomination. They actually put imitation cream meat in a vegetarian dish and don't call it out on the menu. The dish tasted heavily of sesame oil so much so, that it became tiresome to eat. This one went to the trash. The Sambal honey fried chicken was ok. It is reminiscent of another local area shop's signature dish so comparisons come to mind when eating it and it fell short. The lemongrass chicken was reportedly the best dish, though was not breathtaking. It was just better than the rest. Overall this was a lot of disappointed people out for lunch. The price was high to spend for lunch, especially when it didn't satisfy. I'll admit we walked in with high expectations after watching the IG photos for weeks, but this place needs some more work to be worthy of stopping by. About $10 for lunch is a common standard and I blew past that to $24 w/o tip. It's unsustainable at that price point for what amounts to a simple lunch",

I know they are trying and I know it's new, but the flavors were not there. For the price, I'd rather take the walk to Ekiben - larger portions and amazing flavors. Bubble tea was okay. Lots of ice and the bubbles had an unexpected burnt marshmallow taste. I prefer the walk to iFusion for that.",
