They shredded the pork too tiny to the point where it doesn't seem like I got any at all and it was sour. I use to get these noodles all the time and it was big chunks of pork. Also, I bit into big chunks of whole garlic cloves, eck! I will try this again but in the Manhattan location.",

I\u2019ve been eating here for five years, attended the grand opening of one location, and painstakingly recreated their menu at home when I cannot make it to the store. My choice is N1, a classic that the owners have made videos on, and describe as a favorite, for good reason. It should go without saying, given the signage in the store, that you should get at least the regular spicy level when you order here. It is the reason the food is what it is, and the chili oil has the depth that makes you question the reasons for life. If you do read this review: know that this meal is worth traveling hours for, and has a cult following for a reason.",

I told almost every person I know there is a XiAn restaurant here when it is opening.  But today, I got a pork burger. It contains less meat than before. And it is even full of fatty. I am a fatty lover, like in Katz\u2019s.  But now I want to throw out. The fatty is white and no taste. You can feel the whole solid in you mouth.  It is not only a complaint, as a Xi\u2019aner, I want people in different culture background respect our culture and food. At least, there should have a SOP for operation. Attitude is everything.  Updated after response: As XiAner, I can recommend some pork burger brands like ZhangJi in ZiWu Road(General Store). QinYu, inside ZhuBaShi, and WangKui, it was used to locate in ErHuan road near the Providence Stadium.  Definitely, we can\u2019t use that kind of standard. I just compare it with my previous experience in this store, which is fair in statistics. Today my burger is 80% fatty 20% lean.  If you are the manager who wants to follow something, I give you a cue. Check the your CCTV around 2:20pm. I thought the lean is all on the left one. See the right burger almost fatty. That is it.",

You have various options for meat, my fave is the oxtail because of the fattiness of the meat and it compliments the spicy wide noodle perfectly. The noodles are long and wide, I\u2019m pretty good with the chops so if you\u2019re a amateur it will put your wrists to work, go with the fork option if that\u2019s the case. You can also have the option of plain noodles or in broth. Old school hip hop is always on rotation.",
