The people behind the counter ignored me, not even looking up. A server moved around me not once, twice but 3 times without saying anything but excuse me so she could get access to food to be served. Being in the hospitality industry for 15 years I understand how service should work. Rather than ask how she might assist me, she avoided interacting. I finally interrupted someone to ask about my order. Without words I was led to a metal shelf stand next to the window and was given a bag containing my order. The food was good, cold by the time I arrived home 4 minutes later. The food warrants 4-stars but service or lack thereof - 1. I will try them again but service and customer attention should be a focus.",

It\u2019s in the shopping center with the Giant,etc. I usually get a burrito w/ half chicken/steak, guacamole , cheese, garlic lime rice, black beans, sour cream, etc. it\u2019s so huge I can\u2019t finish it in one sitting. Then I head to their salsa station and grab a couple little ramekins of tomatillo (green mild) salsa! Add that w/ each bite and it\u2019s heaven!!! The burrito usually runs me a little less than $12!  Everything is so fresh. You order then wait a short time while it\u2019s cooked like right in front of you. They always have a crowd inside since they\u2019ve been in the neighborhood . I still love and miss Qdoba but District Taco has taken over since Qdoba closed awhile back.  PS: I do wish I had the option to add queso to my burrito and not have to order a side of it! I want it inside my burrito!",

They don't offer any type of grilled tortilla to make it firm and more browned. In fact, asking so results in no appearance of it being grilled. The corn tortilla always gets spongy and almost falls apart. The salsas have bland flavors and a limited heat dimension. Lots of appreciation for having a clean place, fast service, a generous pico de gallo bar with great pico flavor, and having the option for single tacos. It is great to see a place use compostable cutlery. It is great that they have 2 vegan options. The side items come in a pitifully tiny container. The 3rd star is given for vegan options.",

We got several different types of tacos and the only thing not cold was the beans in the kids meal. The  the cheese wasn't even melted. So we told the people who work at the restaurant who were very apologetic and nice. They brought out the same food again, and again it was all luke warm at best and the cheese wasn't melted. We asked people around us and they said their food came the same way. Maybe my standards are too high, but definitely not going back to pay for cold food (also it's a good safety risk when food is being kept cold/warm, so look for the next Chipotle food safety  headlineto be District Taco)",

They've only been open for a few days, but I have to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. I've had the chicken tacos twice now. The tacos were fine, but nothing extraordinary. And like other reviewers have noted, fall apart soggy when you take them  home.  I'll likely be back because it's convenient and to try the other menu items, but it wasn't a \"wow\" meal for me.",

        "caption": "We were so excited that silver spring would be getting a district taco!  It's clear from the lines on day two that there is a need for more variety here.  First impression:  It is so loud that anybody with PTSD will need to stay away.  It's like a battle field with more shrill number shouting.  There's an immediate anxiety upon walking in which is made worse by the metalic grinding of the benches on the concrete floor.  Barbacoa taco- not sure why they gave us two tortillas as it had about 6 microscopic dry cubes of what may have been meat at one point and nothing else on the taco.  Shrimp taco- best to eat in house.  We live about 3/4 of a mile away and it was fall apart soggy by the time we got home.  Decent flavors but nothing special.  Carnitas Burrito- there needs to be some kind of burrito rolling course that emphasizes that the rice (all 2 pounds of it) need not take up the whole side of the burrito.  Anytime I bit into the right side of the burrito it was a mouthful of very overcooked and under garlic/limed rice.  The left side went like this: two mouthfulls of shredded cabbage (no frills at all), followed by two bites of grilled vegetables, followed by a bite each of beans first and then finally the meat.  Which was a mixture of carnitas that was bland and one or two cubes of barbacoa which I didn't order.  Oh yeah, and thanks for that hair mixed in with the shredded cabbage.  That was about the only flavor it had.  We are being harsh because we hope things change.  We want this place to succeed as we would love to have a local place to frequent in a few months once they iron out the flaws.",
