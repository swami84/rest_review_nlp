My hot appetizer came out long before my friend's so mine was cold by the time she got hers. At 9:20 pm we still had not gotten our entrees so we asked for the rest of our three course meal to go. I watched the person bussing tables finish clearing dirty dishes then touch the cheesecake (that had clearly come from a store as it was in one of those large plastic containers with the paper in between each slice) as she put it in our to-go boxes. Our pizzas came out in to go boxes with half of the ingredients they were supposed to have on them. Felt bad for the bartender/waitress, she was very sweet (kept apologizing to everyone) but clearly overwhelmed. The cheesecake is in the trash and the pizza is untouched in the fridge as I was not eating it at 10 pm when I got home so the only food I can judge is the cold dumplings. Very disappointing because the menu looked great, the place is cool and I love to support locally owned restaurants.",
