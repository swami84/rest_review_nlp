Now the containers are barely filled halfway, and the variety of vegetables has been reduced, and more inedible items like peppercorns are placed into the portion. I've seen this before, this is what happens a few months before a place goes out of business. Well, they lost me as a customer.",

        "caption": "Horrible food and service. Absolutely disgusting fried rice - drenched in oil, salty, no flavor with uncooked meat. Check out all other 1 star reviews here, they are very accurate. They know nothing of Thai spices and simply very rude. I ordered from here today and they arrived after 1.5 hrs when they estimated 30-40 mins. No apologies, the first person who picked up the phone hung up on me when I asked for a refund. When I called again they said they'd arrive in 3 mins, it took another 10. The food delivered was drenched in oil (when I had specifically asked for less oil), no flavor whatsoever but salty, bits of burnt flakes I couldn't identify and some of the beef was pink so I threw it out. When I called again to really ask for a refund, they simply stopped picking up the phone. Seamless reimbursed me, but the restaurant apparently said that I wanted the food (I did, until I had to wait even longer and see the horrible food) and refused to reimburse. You have some balls to operate like this when people can freely exchange their experiences and honest opinions online. My full name is listed and I can't remember ever writing anything on yelp but here it is. The worst food and service I've ever had NYC since my residence starting 2008, the only time I have ever had to call the Seamless customer service for my money back. If you think this food is edible you have absolutely no taste. If the Tom Yum fried rice tastes like burnt meat (it is supposed to be the most flavorful, but had no trace of lemongrassy spices in it - just salty and disgustingly oily) I can only guess what other orders must taste like. I asked for \"thai spicy\" in the order, too. Not spicy at all of course. This places knows nothing of thai spices and the kitchen is insanitary. The burnt pieces and pink meat were disgusting. I couldn't touch the food even after starving all day. Check out your latest ratings on seamless. People are picking up on the horrible service and food, and your business won't survive much longer like this. Why put garbage down my throat when there are tones of good options in UWS. I hope more people realize this sooner and do not waste their time and money. Big portions of garbage, served by people with no morals. Good luck.",

Great deal!  I have been here and ordered from here many times and after taking a break from this restaurant when their quality seemed to be going down, they have clearly made changes, and I have found the food to be better, fresher, and more flavorfully spiced than ever!  I got a yellow curry with chicken and it was probably the best meal of that dish I have ever eaten! Their Thai iced tea is also AMAZING! My friend got the pineapple fried rice which was also very good. We split spring rolls and they were tasty and fresh and delicious too.  This time I dined at the restaurant. Whenever I order they are always speedy with delivery as well! They do a lot of pickups and deliveries so they are pretty fast. I like to order in when I'm feeling lazy but like most restaurants their serving dishes are different from their takeout dishes and I think you get a bit more food when you go into the restaurant (portions are still large for takeout just making an observation).",

The Pad Thai had a pungent smell that made me question if I should even try it. The taste was worse... bitter and unpleasant. The Sweet and Sour platter lacked flavor (despite being drowned in sauce). The shrimp were mushy and taste \"fishy\" which indicated they were no good. I will NEVER eat from here again.
