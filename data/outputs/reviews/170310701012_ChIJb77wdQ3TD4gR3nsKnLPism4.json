Walked over to this sorry excuse for customer service I have ever experienced. I was spoke to as if I was homeless, told if youre not buying anything get out way before I even got to the Sneeze gaurd order area. This happened at around 415pm on sun june 3rd 2018, I really will not be eating at that location, I also will let all my postal employee co workers how these people treat the disabled. That heavyset  guy should be fired 100000000%, and maybe put someone behind the counter that likes being employed in a customer service based job.",
