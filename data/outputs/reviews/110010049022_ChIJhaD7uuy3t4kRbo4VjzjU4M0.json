The food was just down right good.  The appetizer had just the write hint of turmeric and I had never eaten a Marigold flower but I must say it definitely added some pizazz to the flavor of the dish. We had made reservations as I don't think you would get a table on a Saturday night with one.  They give you a 2 hour timeslot and that is your time.  I can respect that these days with the limitation on seating with Covid.  Their Covid protocol was good and made me feel safe  The Server was attentive and served us well.

The smell from the open kitchen made us can't wait to explore the menu.Soko Ketse was recommended and surprised how they can make this dish with such a simple mushroom to be so tasty. Ajapsandali (eggplants) dish would be completed if there were some kind of bread tag along. Ajaruli- the boat shape khachapuri is the highlight of the brunch. The Duck Dirty Rice is a love too although for me I think it could have been more flavorful but don't take my standard as this is my first time having it. Pork-beef soup dumpling ( Kalakuri) is something I recommend you to try as well. If you end up having a full belly already, just take it home and microwave it still tastes as good.  One thing they need to seriously fix is the fly problem. I sat indoor and often get bugged by fly and fruit fry in which the only excuse I could give to them was that the front door is opened?... still, that was not cool.  However, overall, It was a relaxing Saturday afternoon brunch. Please don't be in a hurry to leave if you come here, take your time to enjoy the food/drinks and relax otherwise you might get upset as the service can be slow on weekends.",

        "caption": "I had an immensely sleezy end to my evening here. So sleezy I have to give this place one star. A person in my party ordered a dish that required bread. As all the complimentary table bread had been consumed by the time his dish arrived and it came with no bread on it's own,(Which is surpsing. The dish should be prepared for the customer, not the customer prepared for the dish) we asked for more bread. Keep in mind, this is restaurant week and our meals are $35 per plus we ordered a $60 bottle of wine. He waited. Unable to eat his appetizer. So I asked again. He waited some more and our entree arrived. As we were finishing up that I asked again. \"He can't eat this if he doesn't have bread,\" I added. A man, I presume to be the manager, came over and advised the bread was made to order and was in the oven. He didn't seem pleased at all btw. Definitely with the tone of \"I'm being extra.\" Fine. But, also these are the dishes you set up for restaurant week? How can you serve a dish that absolutely needs bread and A LOT of it but not have any on hand.  I didn't say this, but still he was a bit curt to me. Finally the bread arrived just before dessert. We get the check. They charged us for the bread! I waved over a staff and pointed this out. She said, \"You receive two bread for restaurant week and you ordered one extra.\" I said, \"No, I asked for bread three times, but we only received two breads.\" She then said without missing a beat, \" You receive one bread for restaurant week, but then you ordered one more.\" You're going to lie to me right there! For $3! Like literally change what you just said to my face without blinking. I couldn't believe it. But I'm not going to fight with someone over $3 there. I'll do it here. That was a gross end to our evening. A. You were rude to me when I'm trying to ensure a pleasant evening for my shy guest. He's looking at me forlorned all evening because I guess you expected us to make sure he kept a ration of what was already a tiny portion of bread for 4 people for his appetizer??? B. You obviously desperately needed to hit me back in some way over the bread because it didn't matter how many breads we received, you just needed to make sure you charged me for it. Essentially, hey, I'm just there to have a good evening. It's you who came back with two unnecessarily emotional responses over something so petty. Mature a little.",

        "caption": "I do not ever post reviews, but I found this specific incident to be one of the most horrific treatments of verbal assault that I've ever experienced from a restaurant employee who is supposed to be representing a restaurant during a time when the food industry is particularly vulnerable. My partner called Supra on Sunday, July 5th at 9pm to simply ask about a possession that may have been left there a while back. When asked, the woman who my partner spoke with immediately laughed and was condescending. She said \"it's been X amount of time\" and did not bother to check. As my partner politely said \"thank you\" and proceeded to ask if they are open for outdoor seating (because we would like to support their business), she hung up the phone. We called back to express that it was very condescending and rude the way she addressed the missing possession, but also CONTINUED to ask about their status of the restaurant because we have been returning customers. She immediately shouted \"you have no idea what I've been going through today\" and again stated how it was ridiculous that we were calling about the missing possession, while still not addressing the status of operations. We were honestly speechless and shocked by the verbal assault she delivered, and we explained that we were simply customers and verbally should not have the burden of being the victim of a restaurant representative's \"bad day\". She then aggressively blamed her demeanor on the restaurant's position during COVID-19. This is absolutely not the way to treat customers during COVID. We asked to speak to a different person because she was not entertaining any questions, but she stated she was a manager. We asked for her name and she said \"I don't have to give you my name\" and continued having a manic episode over the phone. We eventually ended the call in frustration after getting an answer about their operating status, but it was without reason because we will not be taking the risk of supporting a restaurant that has verbally assaulted us, when we can easily support other local businesses that make us feel good as consumers. Driving customers away during a time when the restaurant industry is fragile is extremely hurtful to the restaurant and has absolutely resulted in losing us as loyal customers. This story will be shared widely, because no customer deserves to be verbally assaulted for simply asking if there was a possession left behind. We are extremely heartbroken because we've adored this restaurant since moving to DC, and as someone in the restaurant industry myself, I feel hurt that we cannot ethically support the business.",

I called this evening around 9 pm EST  to see if they still have it and spoke to a \"manager,\" who scoffed at my question, laughed, and said \"there's no way we would have that at this point, it's been months\" in a such a condescending tone. She then hung up before I could ask her a follow-up question so I called back and I explained how I found her tone uncalled for and unacceptable. She then began to lecture me on how I had \"no idea what she was going through today\" and that I had \"no right to be upset with her tone.\" I asked to speak to a manager to which she responded \"I am the manager.\" I then asked for her name to which she replied, \"I don't need to give you that.\" I informed her I would seek out how to get in touch with her supervisor and she responded, \"good luck!\" I honestly have never had such a negative, belittling, and dismissive interaction in my life with someone. This saddens me because I love Supra and am a loyal, returning customer, but I honestly am not sure I can ever return after this incident.",

They serve it with a pat of butter and an egg yolk that the server mixes in the bread boat for you and then you dig in. The bread tasted fresh and covered in melted cheese.... yum.  The eggplant was a bit of a surprise; rather than tasting like eggplant it tasted mostly like the nutty mixture that was inside the wrap. An interesting taste that I liked but wasn\u2019t my favorite part of the meal.  THIS. FISH. We never managed to get the name of the fish but we polished it off as cleanly as you could with a fork. Super tender with crispy grilled skin and served with a bunch of greens and a pomegranate sauce this was a highlight of the meal for sure. The fish wasn\u2019t fishy at all and frankly tasted great on its own but the salad definitely added another layer of flavor. We preferred to eat it without the sauce but the sauce itself was very interesting! Savory and sweet it wasn\u2019t like anything we\u2019ve ever had before.  Dessert was also amazing. Sweet and tart all at once with a texture that felt like a slightly grainier jello? I\u2019m not selling it very well but trust me it was great.  The atmosphere was good! It was fairly spacious and we didn\u2019t feel too close to other tables. It has the modern vibe that a like of mid-upper class places in DC tend to have. The service was good, our server explained the dishes well to us when we asked and had the information memorized and understood very well. There was a period where he disappeared for 10 minutes when we wanted the check but sometimes nature calls so I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt. It can be quite loud but that could also just be the other diners we unfortunately had next to us that day.",

I would like to try some of the others, but If youve never had khachapuri before, you should get the Ajaruli.  Beef Chashushuli: absolutely delicious, especially on a cold night.

Georgia is geographically on the northwest border of Turkey. The food had a similar geography. It reminded me of the Turkish pides and kebabs, but the roasted chicken had flavoring that reminded me of Eastern European dumplings. The decor of the restaurant has a midcentury vibe with custom teak/walnut seating and Georgian hats hanging from the ceiling. The bathroom had Georgian vinyl records on the wall and old black and white snap shots in the hall. The servers are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. I really loved the place. Try it.

        "caption": "Failed attempt at Georgian Food presented in French fine dining format (less is more) with absolutely dismal service. 5 of us drove 1.5hrs to Supra for the 1st time.  I have never walked out in the middle of service nor has I ever had Management comp my meal.   Supra did both.  If I had to break it down in stars:  Food: 2, Service: 0, Ambiance: 3.  Overall: 1  SERVICE: 25 minutes to get water.  Waiter couldn't pronounce any dishes.     Chkrhirtma was described as \"it\u2019s like American chicken soup\". No Georgian wines knowledge whatsoever.  45 minutes and we asked another waiter to order at least appetizers and wine.  1hr 45min into service!!! we finished appetizers incl. the ones we were advised by 2nd waiter to double as portions are small.  We finished our wine and empty glasses were sitting at our table. Our real waiter  silently grabs our empty glasses and menus and walks.  I asked if he wants to know if we like another wine?  How about entrees?  But at this point (1hr 45min) we called the FOH manager.  Result \u2013 we left!  Manager despite my objection, did buy our meal.  So service is non-existent and you think food would make up.   Nope. FOOD...  People of Georgia in the Caucasus region, famous for its hospitality and cuisine.  More is never enough there.    Serving Georgian food French style in a tiny little portions is like ordering Lo Main at Chinese place and have 1 noodle on the plate.   Visit any one of a dozen Georgian restaurants located from Philadelphia to New York and you will see how it\u2019s done.   Most appetizers here are very small \u2013 bite or tapas size. Exception would be a Khachapuri as it is good.  For Khachapuri I would only pick Ajaruli as a classic. Beet Themalit salad on the plate covered less than half.  Nothing special or flavorful. Eggplant Nigvzit was also small and it was sort of ok. Very special dish, Chvishtari - fritters of corn with smoked sulguni turned into a joke.   4 tasteless poppers with challenge to find cheese.  Sulguni is an excellent cheese and lemon-mint yogurt sauce could have made a difference if not for a tiny drop on the top and missing cheese. Lobia Kotanshi - too small to really figure out when all had so little of taste. I can\u2019t review any other food as we never got to it.  So why is this the way it is at Supra.  If you note, ownership and top chefs in the kitchen are not Georgian or from Georgia.  One sous chef is, but apparently her influence is not enough to say to the rest that this is not how food is served in Georgia, people, or any other Georgian restaurants anywhere in the world.   Front Staff has no knowledge of food or wines.  Not even an attempt of properly pronouncing names.    Oh, how I would have wanted to see a non-ethnic chef produce great ethnic food.  It would truly be an accomplishment.   I know It\u2019s been done before and I live with one as well.  But Supra misses the mark at food or service.   It\u2019s a shame as when reading highs of management staff credentials you realize it clearly don\u2019t mean a thing here.  Something else comical\u2026   General Manager was telling 5 of us about 2 Michelin Stars they have at Supra.   And I have a Brooklyn Bridge for sale.  Supra has no stars.   Supra is on Bib Gourmand list of restaurants in DC.  For those not familiar, Michelin Travelers Guide designed for travelers first and then foodies.   Foodies look at stars and the rest at budget meal places and hence the category.  Finally, as I have mentioned before, order a couple of Chachapuri to-go with a bottle of Kingzmarauli or Kvnachkara wine and hit home with it.  Do not ask or consult with any staff.  This is as close as you will get to taste Georgian meal in DC today.  We actually went to another restaurant that night as we were still hungry from \"huge\" appetizers.   Also first one for me.   Our group consisted of Executive Chef, General Manager of the Restaurant and Bar chain,  FOH Manager of fine dining restaurant, Catering Manager.  All from different restaurants.   It is with heavy disappointment that I brought myself to even write this review.",

There's a very cozy bar seating around the corner from the hostess too, great for meetups and dates, and you might not see it unless you're headed to the restroom already.  Great foodie spot on 11th!!!",

Service was very slow and not attentive. After we arrived we were waiting Water 20 min, then to order some appetizers its took other 25 min.it was hard to get our server attention. We end it up not ordering any entres and second bottle of wine. We end it up leaving  other place, up to street and actually got fantastic service and food.this place definitely has lots of things to improve. The worst thing was the manager, who has his attitude toward us.Improvement  need to start with management. We want to wish good luck to this place.",

I still dream about the eggplant nigvzit which was hands down one of the most memorable dishes of 2019... the khachpuri (cheesy bread with toppings), khinkali (soup dumplings, they have a daily meat and a daily veggie option, we went with the meat ones), and a cold cucumber yogurt soup rounded out the meal. All were incredible. As was the Georgian wine. There were so many other bites and spreads that we didn't get to that I can't wait to go back and try. Also really excited for Tabla, their new sister restaurant coming to Petworth (next door to Call Your Mother!) soon-ish.  Supra truly is a gem. A wonderful, tasty, surprising gem.",

We were blown away by our experience!!!  When we came in it was happy hour and there were excellent drink specials as well as smaller sized food portions at discounted prices. We tried almost everything on the menu and both had about 3 or four drinks and everything came out to only about a hundred bucks...way more than we were thinking and planning for.  Everything was delicious.  The wines from Georgia had an excellent taste which was like nothing I've ever had.  You could taste the earthiness from the clay vessels they are stored in.  It was amazing.  All of the dishes were excellent but the Imeruli Khachapuri and the Khibizgina were my favorites.  We sat at the bar and Brandon, our bartender, was outstanding.  He provided excellent recommendations and took time to talk about the foods and wines...giving us additional background on each.  He provided outstanding service!  Finally, the music they were playing was right out of my typical playlist...including Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Portishead, The National, and many others.  I've never been to a place that actually played that kind of music.  Kudos to your DJ!  Couldn't recommend this restaurant any higher.  It is definitely our go-to spot in DC.",

Unfortunately, my birthday night was ruined by the aggressive, rude, and hostile manager who was on duty this evening (Juanita 11/21/19). She reacted horribly to a situation and left a very negative atmosphere in her wake. After spending over $600, she decided to berate us over a $10 grocery store cookie cake. The policy (charging $25 to cut and serve the cake) was not the problem, the manager's attitude, delivery, and demeanor was. Sadly, it was enough to make us all never want to return, nor recommend to anyone else. Hopefully in the future, a manager with over 15 years of hospitality management experience,  one who should excel in customer service and interaction, will learn how to properly interact and speak to customers.",

It looks like waters and food runners just do not know their menu. The same time we have been waiting and waiting to get one of the sups we really ordered. The food was fine, we liked it  (I should give 2 stars because of quality of food). But the choice of wines is very specific and you should not drink vines in this restaurant.

Hopefully Supra will soon have service to match the excellent food.  Simply awful service. Our party of five arrived shortly after they opened at 5 pm, so they were not at all busy. And yet we were left sitting at our table for 10 minutes, with waiters walking past us, chatting amongst themselves, completely ignoring us. I finally had to flag down a waiter, who took our order with indifference bordering on hostility. He walked away and left us sitting with our menus still in our hands. I collected the menus and sat them at the empty table next to us, which prompted a stream of waiters offering to take our order. Why not assign waiters to tables? Supra's \"system\" is pure chaos, and shared tips does not help with bad service. But it did not end there. The rude waiter got the khachapuri order wrong (I clearly described what I wanted even if I did not know the name of the dish), and when the wrong dish arrived, I tried to politely say \"I thought I ordered the adjaruli\" - to which the impertinent waiter replied with an incredulous \"You think you ordered? Or do you know?\" He fixed his mistake, but that was the last we saw of him - the food came, cattle car style from random runners, but no wait staff checked in on us again. I asked the last food runner to pack up the remaining khachapuri and bring the check; he acknowledged my request and then almost immediately stacked dirty plates on top of the leftover khachapuri. We waited and waited for the check. I finally had to ask the hostess / manager for the check - I explained that while the food was excellent, the service was terrible. She mumbled something like \"sorry about that,\" but once she saw to getting the check, she wasn't the least bit interested in hearing about our experience. The evening ended for me in their filthy bathroom (at 6:30 pm - really?) with a disgusting autoflush toilet that wasn't working. And yet by the time we left, the place was full. I just read numerous reviews about the bad service going back several months, but I guess management just doesn't care as long as the food brings in customers. Well, Supra has several less customers now. I will not tolerate service like this, no matter how good the food may be.",

Definitely get a combination of cold, hot, khachapuri (cheese-filled bread) and khinkali (soup dumplings) to get the whole experience.  FAVORITES: (Cold) EGGPLANT NIGVZIT: Eggplant stuffed with walnuts, cilantro - $7 *The eggplant was very tender and the filling was nutty and herbaceous (Cheese-Filled Bread) AJARULI: Boat-shaped cheese bread, organic egg yolk - $14 *I've had this bread before but this was by far the best khachapuri I've ever had, the cheese was salty and eggy and the bread was crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside.  I also realized that I have never  mixed the egg and cheese enough because Juanita the manager mixed it for us and it tasted so much better! (Soup Dumplings) KHINKALI: Beef/Pork Soup Dumplings (6) - $18 *Really unique experience, their selection changes daily and I loved how the process of eating this was so great!  Steamed dumplings with hot soup inside.  Yassss.  I would suggest getting 3 if you plan on getting a lot of other plates. (Dessert) YOGURT MURABIT: Panna cotta, candied cherries, black walnuts - $10 *I love panna cotta but oftentimes restaurants don't get the texture right and this was perfectly creamy and the toppings of fruit and nuts really went well with the dish.  GOOD: ELARJI - $7 *this is gonna sound weird but the interior texture reminded me of crab meat but the dish was tasty, my friend wanted these but croquettes aren't my thing BOSTNEULL TOLMA - $8 *pretty tasty for grape leaves, weren't too bitter and it was interesting with the red peppers APPLE CAKE: Gluten-free apple cake, caramelized apples, vanilla ice cream - $12 *this cake was really moist and tasty for being GF but the panna cotta was so amazing that the apple cake was overshadowed  WINE: They have an extensive wine list with a lot of skin contact wines (Qvevri) which I found a little too bitter or sour for me so I went with a rose which was fabulous!  If you don't like Qvevri wines I would suggest asking your server which ones aren't.  SERVICE: Our server was 100% on for our entire dining experience.  The manager Juanita educated us on Georgian food and made great recommendations throughout dinner.  VERDICT: Yes this restaurant will be in my regular rotation - I can't wait to come back!",

Even on a Wednesday night, the restaurant area was pretty full.  The ajaruli bread was easily the best thing ever. They mix the egg into the hot cheese at the table and everything gets cooked to perfection. Impossible to stop eating.  Plenty of other tapas-style options for vegetarians. They usually have a meat and vegetarian option for the soup dumplings- we tried the mushroom dumpling and they were amazing! The summer squash dressing was really good too. The only disappointing part was the dessert, which was a chocolate tort. Unfortunately they were out of the chef's special even though it was pretty early.  Would love to go back one day just for the ajaruli or to try their brunch menu.",

Unsure if last week Restaurant week was not available in the bar area but we were not offered the restaurant week menu... Bar service was slow and painful: waiter had to be waved for water, ordering meals, etc. Also, lots of mosquitoes INSIDE the bar. My friend got bitten 6 times on the legs and we overheard a dad make the comment  to the manager about mosquitoes which fell flat. Having been to Georgia we were looking forward so much to this experience - we were disappointed. Overall price affordable.",

The manager said they were aware of the issue to which I can only wonder why it goes on. The more problematic issue is the cattle call way they delivered the food. We had a larger party and the server took orders from individuals. The food was delivered by a server walking up to the table and calling out a dish. This is lazy service and it implies we know the names of the dishes or what they should look like. We had never had Georgian food or been to this restaurant. The result was a whole table not getting what they asked for and feeling frustrated about it. The food as it was served was good, which is why the two stars. Had it been for service, it would have been one.",

The wait staff is amazing and know their food and alcohol pairings well! The food is great as well.  We ordered the dishes family-style, as they suggested, and we not disappointed as the dishes looked small, but were very filling and flavorful. Definitely give the egg bread and the soup dumplings a try! The meats are cooked just right. Parking may be hard, so look for the nearest metro station (Mt. Vernon Sq/ Convention Center area).",

The experience was fantastic from the kind staff, to the lovely traditional hats displayed around the venue to the food/drink. The menu looks like a small plate kind of place. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a medium size plate place. The portions are fair sizes and very good. I loved the pork dumplings out of everything I tried. The chicken kabob is tasty and comes with four large chunks of meat. The chicken comes with two sauces on the side - the spicy sauce was my favorite. Try the wine flight for $17- comes with three portions to try. My friend and I had the amber wine flight. The wines were very nice and different compared to wines I\u2019ve had in the USA. Come here and try Georgian food it\u2019s amazing. The servers were helpful and came out frequently. They instructed us how/ when to eat some of the foods. It was an educational experience.  Second review- Date night or a place to take an adventurous eater. The food is amazing and you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. I loved the orange wine. I wish I could buy more bottles to take home. The braised beef is a must. I would say get 3 dishes (1small, 1 bread type dish- the cheese egg one, and 1 big plate) and two people will be very comfortable. I loved the meat dumplings they were delicious.",

At first, portion size is really small. It's ok for French restaurant, but not Georgian. Second: in Georgian kitchen one of the most delicious dishes is kebob. It should be juicy, with special spices, cooked from a good marinaded meet and properly grilled. What we were served way too far from Georgian kebob. It was three pieces of burned charcoals called \"kebob\" by someone evil irony. I believe that Georgian chef left this restaurant. Real Georgian would die rather than serve such food to a guest. I'd not recommend this restaurant.",

Ajaruli bread: Bread was fantastic, but it's almost like a soup bowl and in the middle they put egg, butter, and LOTS of cheese.  Was almost too cheesy and we ended up just eating the bread.   Decent dish, but would have liked more spices.  Khinkali (Beef) Dumplings: Just average.  Was bland and lacked any potent flavor.  Didn't really come with any sauce or sides.  Layout: Beautifully designed restaurant, ample space.  They have a cool map of Georgia and sell small trinkets.   There's an outdoor seating area which was popular.  Service: Easy to make and change reservations.  Wait staff was friendly, prompt, and very knowledgeable about the menu.",

The waiter came by to tell us about the menu, and we ended up sharing the rolled eggplant, baked mushrooms, and bread with cheese and spinach inside. The food was all tasty but they were a bit bland and lacking flavor. The eggplant was unique and I haven't had any dishes quite like it, but the baked mushrooms were quite normal as they were just button mushrooms with cheese inside, baked. The bread was a cross between puff pastry and actual bread, and the inside filling wasn't amazing. It was all in all a very average meal. Service was friendly and our waters got refilled appropriately, but food portions and flavor were not great. The food was around $37 post-tax pre-tip which was definitely on the pricey side for the portions.",

IMO, asking for a sub of bacon, or literally anything else, instead is pretty reasonable since the eggs are what make the dish filling (eggs being the main source of protein and fat in the dish). No other place in my life has said \u201cno\u201d to this kind of request until this place. Customers don\u2019t like to feel nickel and dimed!

Parking can be a bit difficult so we found an office building right across the Marriott and which closes at 9pm (didn't catch when but Wed for sure). If you plan to leave before then, I believe it's $12-$22 max.  Service was great.  Food - this is where I give it 3 stars and only because this is my opinion and taste preference. I understand that the style of food is Georgian with American influence. However, I believe the restaurant could still improve the food flavor to fit more flavor palates in this area. The appetizers were what we mainly liked. Entree just didn't make the cut. Presentation is nice though!  Liked - Eggplant Nigvzit - interesting taste and definitely enjoyable - Kartopili Kamit (Fingerling Potatoes) - cant go wrong with potatoes - Walnut Cake - awesome flavor and textures  Okay - Pork and Beef Soup Dumplings - more meatball flavor with a lighter/blander soup - probably to compensate for the meaty flavor and plus they give you pepper to add on. Dish just didn't have the zing I'm use to from Taiwanese soup dumplings so likely a fault from my previous expectation (so this is a dish you should judge for yourself).  Disliked - Chkmeruli (chicken in garlic sauce and traditional bread) chicken was well cooked - seasoned and moist. But the creamy garlic sauce was what made it underwhelming and weird. The texture is more like the consistency of porridge or egg drop soup. The sauce tasted very bland like it was missing salt and although the bread was good, it becomes useless without a great dipping sauce. However we did get half a chicken so maybe that's why there was less compensation of flavor in the sauce.  Conclusion - It seems the way the food is made is more dependent on the flavors from the meats while the sauce or soup is to add more moisture/ fluid texture? The sauce/ soup are missing salt which makes them bland. Based on other reviews and my experience, I wouldn't be confident that I would enjoy coming a 2nd time.",

        "caption": "Cheese and bread galore! Supra is a fun culinary experience. My hubby and I had a Georgian feast with the tasting board, potato and cheese dumplings, and warm fluffy Khachapuri breads baked in a clay oven and filled with scrumptious cheese!  The $25 tasting board is fun to try and well worth it! The sampler of spreads, cheeses, breads, and eggplant rolls was a great way to dabble into the cuisine. The Eggplant Nigvzits stuffed eggplant rolls with walnuts and cilantro were hands-down my favorite item on the platter and quickly devoured! Of the Makho spreads, the carrot was surprisingly tasty and enjoyed the Nadughi soft cream cheese. The mozzarella like Sulguni cheese was my favorite, while my hubby enjoyed the guda cheese. Although I wasn't a fan of the minced veggie beet, spinach and green bean pkhali, it was nice to try them. The round cornbread was very dense, the rest of the bread basket was good. We ordered another round of bread which came with pesto aioli, it was so flavorful that I took some home!  The potato and cheese soup dumplings were quite tasty! The soft doughy shell with creamy filling and spices were delicious. We were so full from the sampler that we took some of the dumplings home. Surprisingly, they keep well and followed the Manager's advice to warm them up for a minute and a half covered with a damp paper towel to keep them moist in the microwave. It works, the dumplings were as good as new!  The standout dish of the night was the boat-shaped egg and cheese Ajaruli bread! It was fun to watch the waitress briskly stir in the egg and butter with the cheese. Voil\u00e0 the egg was cooked and ready for consumption! It tasted like cheesy scrambled eggs in a fluffy bread bowl. The dish was loaded with rich savory guda, ricotta, and feta cheese (no Sulgoni). After a few bites, we threw in the towel! Sadly, the egg dish doesn't make for the best leftovers and ate just the fluffy crust at home.  If you enjoy stuffed cheesy bread, then definitely get the Megruli! The Megruli is like a rich white pizza loaded with Sulgoni and 3 other types of cheese. Megruli was good, but a bit too cheesy for me! After having just 1 slice, it was time for my hubby and I to pack up the rest. It makes for great leftovers over the next few days - just heat it up in the oven.  The citrus bubbly Bagrationi blossom cocktail was delicious! The St. Germain, Creme de Cassis and lemon balanced the dry sparkling wine and added a hint of sweetness. The Bagrationi Brut is a bit dry, and preferred the cocktail. My hubby enjoyed the seasonal beer.  My hubby and I were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert, (which is rare)! The cheese and breads are so rich and dense that next time we'll opt for just one flatbread and pepper in some hearty veggie dishes.  Great spot for groups to enjoy a Georgian feast and sample a variety of dishes. I recommend getting 2 dishes per person and 4-5 dishes are more than enough to share for a couple. We had plenty of leftovers! Excited to come go back for the dumplings and try the spinach and cheese Pkhlovani bread along with some potatoes, stews, and salads!",

Another waitress even came over to show us what others were being served and to talk about the food. We enjoyed the happy hour so much that we decided to come back the next night for dinner.  Ehh....... the server crammed us in a corner next to two other couples. The first couple was immediately uncomfortable like us  especially since there was room all over restaurant. Our server didn't seem to have any interest in being at his job. He checked on us maybe 1 time and didn't seem happy about it. We were disappointed. Highly recommend sitting in bar area in future. The servers in there seem happy and beyond friendly. Food and drinks were so delicious!!!",

The decor inside is fresh and inviting. The food, while not mind blowing, was a novel presentation of what I can presume is Georgian soul/comfort food. On the chilly evening we were there, it hit the spot. Everything was hot, filling, and delicious. Our favorite part of the meal was the amazing walnut cake we had for dessert. Not to say that the rest wasn't outstanding. Overall very pleased with our dining experience. Lucky first night in DC i guess.",

I have never had Georgian food, so it seemed like a perfect opportunity to try it with no expectation.  The wine list is interesting. Not being familiar with any of the varieties, I found the descriptions to be very helpful. I went with the flight of amber wines, which were unique and wonderful.  I also ordered the Elarji, a cornmeal and cheese croquette. I instantly regretted having eaten early, while simultaneously making a mental note to come back for a full dinner. I also tasted a companion's Kubdari, a bread stuffed with meat. It was even better.  Our server let us know it was her first day, but she was prompt and friendly, and helped us make sense of the menu. Her service was better than most servers on their hundred and first day, which speaks to the quality of staff they hire.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and well laid out. Very stylish, but also very welcoming and comfortable. A dining room is separated from a bar area with high tops, giving it a sense of seclusion without exclusion.  I definitely need to return for a more thorough investigation of their menu.",

The service was slow at the beginning, even though the restaurant was quiet when we went -- it took 5 minutes to get water, 10 minutes to get water refills (it was a hot day!), and 20 minutes to place our order. But the waiter was really good at explaining different dishes and helping to guide us through the menu. The food was pretty good -- The soup dumplings were good, but not quite as good as I'd been expecting. The salmon was disappointingly dry, although the tomato-walnut sauce it came with was nice. The soko ketse mushrooms were very good. The cheesy immeruli bread was incredibly dense and filling -- probably my favorite dish that we ordered. The restaurant's atmosphere was pleasantly cozy. I think this will be an excellent restaurant once it's been open a little longer, and I'd love to go back with a larger group of people so I can try a wider variety of their dishes and find the real stars of the menu, because I'm sure they exist.",

They don't have many basic Georgian dishes. Khinkali (dumplings) were not fresh at all. I can go to any Russian gourmet and purchase the same dumplings 5 times cheaper. It's not that hard to make them on the house, I honestly don't understand why they've decided not to cook them themselves. When I ordered kharcho (tomato soup), they brought me extremely small dish. I could not even taste the soup itself. The wine selection is ridiculous as well. It looks like they brought the cheapest wine from the state of Georgia, and then decided to overprice it, bacause it is so unique for America. Please don't get me wrong, the Georgian wines are incredible. But there were no really nice wine on the menu selection. If you want to try the truly authentic Georgian cuisine - you should head to Brooklyn, NY. This place is the disgrace for the great Georgian culture and the hospitality.",

Our waitress was so friendly & nice and took a lot of time explaining the different items on the menu - so much so that she made our experience worth the trip to this establishment worth coming back again.  She even showed us the recommended dishes to try when telling her our food tastes.  Great fish, beef and cheese dishes per her recommendations.  I wish we can remember her name because she was so accommodating, friendly and attentive to our every needs.  She checked on us frequently to ensure we were ok with our selections.

Their chicken kebabs are like the kind you would find at a cheap Indian (it is literally Curry BBQ Chicken I swear; they claimed it was marinated, I doubt it since it was dry) or some super-cheap Afghan kebab place. They use some sort of CarbCounter tortilla for one of the \"lamb wrap\" things they have (perhaps the chef is health conscious or loves wheat stuff). It was also VERY LOUD in there and we were packed into the busy restaurant like sardines.  The ground lamb is just very unseasoned. I think someone in my party had also ordered regular Lamb which we all tried and I can't even remember it, it was that forgettable (and I absolutely love lamb so I don't know how this is possible). The parking sucked as always in DC (but usually if parking is hard in a place you should accommodate some other way like not fit everyone so close together I could touch their face). The only good dish was their Turkish egg-and-cheese \"pide\". Their soup dumplings are without salt or sauce, just your ordinary dumpling. I've had better in cheap cafeterias run by Koreans or Chinese. I love Central Asian dumplings but this one was meh.",

        "caption": "Wonderful Dining Experience! Enjoyed a lovely dinner at Supra. We started by reviewing an extensive Georgian wine list, ultimately settling on a semi-sweet, full-bodied, red wine called Kindzamauruli. Simply amazing!  For appetizers we tried 2 types of khachapuri -  imeruli and ajaruli. Both were delicious, but we especially liked the ajaruli, which was rich and buttery.  We also ordered the eggplant nigvzit, which was yummy, but not quite as satisfying as what I've eaten elsewhere...and at  $7/plate for three small pieces, way overpriced. We also tried the lobio kotanshi, which I'd never had before.  It was good, but not my personal favorite and not something I would probably order again. Warm kidney beans stewed with traditional spices and served alongside pickled cabbage and cornbread was a bit odd in taste and texture for this American palate.  For the main course, we tried the pork and beef kabobs, and chkmeruli (pieces of roasted chicken and traditional bread floating in a creamy garlic sauce). We enjoyed each of the dishes, but especially the pork kabobs. We heeded other diners comments about the meat being too dry, so specifically requested that the beef be prepared medium rare, and the pork not overcooked. Both kabobs came out perfectly; tender, hot and juicy.  And the chicken was nice and moist, with a robust garlic flavor. So we were very satisfied with everything that we ordered. Lastly, it's worth noting what exceptional service we received from Tanya, our waitress.  She was top notch; very attentive, helpful, and friendly... And really turned a great dining experience into a phenomenal one. We couldn't have been happier with our first visit to Supra and we'll definitely be back!",
