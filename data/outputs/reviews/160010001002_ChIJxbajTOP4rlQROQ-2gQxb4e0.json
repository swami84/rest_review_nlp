And the Breakfast burrito- amazing flavors wrapped in yumminess. Come hungry. Save room for the pie! Maybe tomorrow.... We will definitely plan our next trip around mealtimes here. Did I tell you about the great customer service? We liked the music and art, as well. Ending our vacation on a High Note. THANK YOU FOR A 5 STAR EXPERIENCE.",

The service here is friendly as well.  The reason for 3 stars is due to the difficulty of ordering over the phone. On one occasion I was referencing the menu found on their website, and the employee had no idea what some of the menu items were. They then admitted they hadn't looked at the updated menu, and the whole process took over ten minutes to place a simple order.  On another occasion, I placed an order for a breakfast burrito which comes with 7 toppings, and once I got all the way back home, my burrito only had 5 of the 7 I asked for (there was no cheese, and no cilantro cream sauce). Considering the price for just a burrito is $12, I was very disappointed and didn't have the time to go all the way back to ask for a corrected order.  The orders here take a while to be made, which is fine, but if I can't call ahead on the phone and trust my order will be right, it will make me think twice about placing a dinner/lunch order here.",

The soup varies from day to day, so I've probably missed a few, and I can say that just when I think there can be no soup better than the African Squash, High Note's amazing chef wowed me with the cream of spinach. I alternate between three favorite meals: Rosemary Seitan and Pesto Mushroom sandwiches and the breakfast burrito, and either the soup of the day or caesar salad. I'd eat here every  day if my pocket book could afford it. I was skimming the reviews and noted most people love High Note as much as I do. I want to comment on a couple of poor reviews b/c they should not deter someone from trying the best restaurant in Boise. There was a complaint/dig about them going to cash & check only. I wish that person would have asked about the why behind that decision - it speaks volumes about the integrity of the owner. The money saved each month in not paying for the credit card machine (that's a BIG hunk of money it turns out) is going to employees in extra salary b/c they're working through a pandemic. It's a brilliant decision to support people working in an industry that's really hard hit by covid, and I don't even consider it an inconvenience (it's old school charming, actually! my grandma and grandpa never even had a credit card, and they were the cutest cash-paying couple ever). There was also criticism from someone who waited a while for their food. I'm sure that was frustrating; however, I am also certain that experience was an outlier. I have probably gotten take out at least 25 times since High Note reopened after their temporary closure, and I've never waited more than a couple of minutes for my food - and I'm happy to wait so that my yummy sandwich is piping hot! High Note is amazing - I can't say enough good things!",

After waiting another 20 minutes (40 minutes total) we called a third time & were told our order had been ready for a while & that they had put it inside the door. No apologies for their miscommunication, & the server tried to blame it on another employee even though I'm pretty sure it was the same person on the phone all three times. Our food was fine, but cold. Oh, also the forks they gave us were broken? Not a big deal but definitely icing on the cake.",

It was a heartfelt goodbye in uncertain times but the owner said to me, ' This is not goodbye, we will be back, when it is safe for customers and our team.'   Anyone can be a small business owner but not everyone can succeed. High Note Cafe has survived and will continue to thrive due their passion for doing things right. I am encouraged and excited about them reopening soon as they bring a tremendous joy and smiles to countless Boise residents near and far. Whether it is a two hand delicious breakfast burrito, homemade bread, Jalapeno hominy, or Tuesday tacos, I and many more will continue to support High Note Cafe in the coming weeks and longer because they make a difference in our community.",

Needless to say I was hoping we could find a restaurant that could cater to her dietary needs. It was 8:30 on a Friday night so we were really pushing the limits of availability here. A quick Google search offered High Note. We were in luck as they closed in about an hour. We headed over in hopes of finding accommodating sustenance. So not only was it a cute, little \"hole-in-the-wall\" type place, but we were happy to find artwork from local artists lining their red walls. The waitress was attentive and friendly. Now...the food. I have been to other vegan restaurants and have left less than satisfied as far as the food was concerned regarding taste and portion, but let me tell you, this place left neither lacking. The portions were extremely gracious (in accordance with menu pricing) and the taste rivaled even most non vegan restaurants. I only wish I could have taken pictures to share. I HIGHLY recommend this local treasure to anyone, vegan or not. The food is beyond the labels and if you don't try them it is only to your disservice. Well done High Note, we definitely left on one. ;)",

The cafe is very small and cramped. It was uncomfortable already but we decided to try it anyways.  There were multiple tables that needed to be cleared off so we were greeted by a waitress and told that she would have someone clean off a table for us. We waited for about 5 minutes for a table to be cleaned off. We sat ourselves down and waited for menus. Again, 7 minutes went by and the waitress finally came over to offer us menus.  Because the service was so slow, I had plenty of time to observe the room. Most tables had food and, to the Cafe\u2019s credit, it looked appetizing. Staff seemed to do a lot of standing around, which was confusing based on how long we were waiting for everything. The music was loud enough that it wasn\u2019t easy to have a conversation. We had to shout at one another as we discussed whether we should stay or leave because (at that point) we had already been there 20 minutes and had not been approached for an order of any kind.  Ultimately, we decided to leave because the service was so bad, it wasn\u2019t worth trying the food to deal with the service and the uncomfortable atmosphere (as stated above, it was stuffy, humid, and did not seem particularly clean). When I found the waitress to tell her that we were going to leave, she said, \u201cYeah. Sorry about that.\u201d  I have never written a review but I felt compelled to share my experience with others. As a vegan, I was so excited to try High Note Cafe so I was beyond disappointed. We do not live in the area and made a special trip just for this restaurant. i am not one to walk out of a restaurant but it was the worst dining experience myself and my family has ever had.",

I'm only dropping one star, because A) going vegan is a morally positive thing to do, so good on them, B) the tomato soup is still godlike, and C) it served as a great meeting place for my uncle and I for years. It was great for so long, I can't bear to drop more than one star. It's just a shame that I'll never be able to have that incredible grilled cheese sandwich anymore.

We weren't  sure what to do so we thought maybe we need to seat ourselves since no one was saying anything, at the time we didn't notice the broken \"please wait to be seated\" sign stuffed in a highchair by the door. When we tried to seat ourselves a waitress snapped at us telling us we need to wait for her to seat us. So we went back to the door and waited a few more minutes. The waitress finally asked us how many were in our party but then went outside and started helping another table. At that point we decided to leave and apparently the waitress thought it was funny because she laughed as we walked past her. I'd been looking forward to trying this place for weeks and want to support vegan restaurants, but unfortunately we won't be returning do to their lack of service.",

I usually think vegan meals that use tofu are a cop-out but everything was so well seasoned, so many yummy ingredients, and it was huge!! Unique decor and music, a hole-in-the-wall gem of a place.  Note that since it's a small restaurant with fresh ingredients, they may run out of certain things (I believe we were the last table of the day to be able to get avocado with our dishes and we were there at about noon, which was 3 hours before closing).  Only complaint is that it was severely understaffed, hoping that someone called in sick and that's not a regular occurrence as it took about 30 min to order food (they had one waitress running their entire floor, but honestly she rocked it). Regardless of the wait, the food was amazing and we will be back for sure.",

Everything made in house and from scratch with vegan options. Even items get sourced from local growers. It's a great environment. There always seems to be something going on. I've caught local music, traveling bands, karaoke, and more. Ever since discovering about a year ago, I cant stay away. Always something yummy to eat. Plus handmade juices. Fresh juice lemonades are the best in the summer. It's a place where you can take your time and slow down to enjoy the atmosphere or friends. Definitely worth checking out.",

The atmosphere is great, they have good live music occasionally and waitstaff is always friendly. On Sunday\u2019s they have a great deal on mimosas, not cheapy mimosas either I\u2019m talking like blueberry basil mimosas with house made juices, I literally cannot say enough good things about this place.

The club sandwich is my current favorite, but I've gone through phases where I woke up craving the Torta and I spent months where I only wanted to eat their reuben. The street Tacos are better than the taco destinations nearby by miles, and the seasonal soups always surprise me with how damn good they are. Beyond the food though, is the magic. If you're from Boise, you know we have had some classic spots over the years. We still have a couple, but we've lost places like the Brick Oven Bistro (Beanery). High Note has the feel of a classic Boise spot. The owner, Maria, is often serving food, and her eyes literally sparkle when she sees someone enjoying their food. High Note supports local artists, musicians, and poets strongly, and has relied on word of mouth for their success. This is a low key punk rock diner tucked away on a quieter corner of downtown Boise, and it is my favorite place to find myself on any given day. There is only one High Note, and if you aren't regularly there, you are literally missing out on the best eating experience in Boise. If I had to pick one meal to try out, I would suggest the club or the Torta with whatever the seasonal soup is and a glass of their iced tea.",

Select $5 appetizers: Bruschetta or Hummus served with HIgh Note Toast or Chips & Dip-- Happy Hour could use some work, IMO.  Wow, what a great place! I've had it on my bookmarks now for well over a year. Not sure why I hadn't visited here before. I'm downtown a lot, but since it's tucked on a side street, I've just not noticed it.  Walking in it isn't much-- just a small room, bright yet old colors on the wall, local artwork, hippy vibe, with a bar area, small amount of seating, and a relaxed albeit modern feel to it.  $1 mimosas (first two) on Sundays. They have four flavors. We had the pineapple and cucumber.  Everything here is fresh! They don't have microwaves, and even hand wash the dishes.  We had some super good food! We shared a Caesar salad (average... it's lettuce!) and breakfast avocado taco-- AMAZING! A++  Here you can get homemade dessert, too. They oftentimes have live music, poets club, and $1 Taco Tuesdays!  All-in-all, the food was good, the service was good, chill/relaxed environment, and a good weekend brunch menu (select items on Sunday only). I recommed you try it!  BTW-- it is located next to Guidos New York Style Pizza behind Flying M Coffee in Downtown Boise.",
