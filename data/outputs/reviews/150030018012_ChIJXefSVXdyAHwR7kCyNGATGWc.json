I said ok that\u2019s fine we will do medium size so we can get the pan crust. They said it would be 45-55 minutes. When they called to say they were 5 minutes away they asked if we could meet them at the lobby because last time he got stuck in the elevator. I was giving kids baths so sent my husband. We received 2 hand tossed crust pizzas- which my kids are just picky and won\u2019t eat.  That\u2019s why I ordered the pan crust. So pbj for 3 disappointed kids on vacay. And on the phone for another ten minutes to talk to person at dominoes only to be told she has to get the manager and then I get cut off. Maybe a mistake? Call back and another ten minutes on hold to talk to another person (who took my original order). Told he has to get a manager. Okay. Manager tells me he will not refund my money because I received product. Said he would make new pizzas and send them out. He must not understand how kids work because when I said my kids were going to bed we can\u2019t wait another hour for remade pizzas, he scoffed that it was only 8:30. He told me he cannot give a refund because that would be punishing a business for making a mistake. And when I said he was punishing me and making me pay for something I didn\u2019t order, he said he thought I just didn\u2019t want to get a solution because he was willing to replace it. I said I was more than happy to give him his pizza back but I had to get my kids to sleep.  He offered credit if he could pick up the pizza I asked what time could he come tomorrow because it was too late tonight and he started hemming and hawing. Mediocre already cold pizza is not worth this hassle. This franchise is ridiculous- I should have just paid resort prices and gotten pizza from the on-site venue.",

Either way, I called in and very simply stated to the manager that we were unsatisfied. They remade our food at a time of our choosing and it was perfect. Everyone we spoke to during the enter process was friendly and ready to make things right. The food was delicious. After the first order my husband said he wouldn't even want it re-delivered. After we got it remade he was ready to make this dominos our new go to for the rest of quarantine.  Very happy. Thanks Rahul and the rest of the crew.",

        "caption": "I would sometimes go into Waikiki on the weekends with friends for a night out. At the end of the night, about 12am-1am, we would order food from this Domino\u2019s since it would normally not be very busy even on weekends. This has been our routine for awhile now. But, sad to say we will not be returning to this Domino\u2019s. It is because of one of their late night staff. A male about 5\u20192 or 5\u20193. He looks like a local Asian and wears a hat. His customer service is horrible, very unprofessional. He projects a \u201ctough-guy\u201d demeanor like he\u2019s mad at something, which is not good if you\u2019re working in customer service.",

Since treasurer was about 24 dollars, I planned to put out 2 dollar bills, 3 copies. I tried to embeat it by grasping a fat male clerk in his hand. Fortunately I was grasping the original number of sheets, so I noticed that I handed over 1 piece and asked if I handed over a lot, and as I asked if I handed over a lot, I was returned \"with falling on the floor\" with a white lie. But if you did not notice it would have been a cat babe.  Perhaps it may be an indication that American salary is low, but the taste is good and the behavior of a single clerk has made it all out.

Talked to the manager and after \"Nadine\" investigated she said nothing was out of order which is weird since the driver tipped himself and then forged my signature, and then got attitude from her once I tried to explain the situation. So beware if you order from this store and check your receipts so you don't fall victim to fraudulent tips.  Replying to Nadine's store response: No one used my card number I paid for the pizza through the app she just went downstairs to pick up the pizza and your driver forged my signature and added a tip to it. Instead of trying to solve the problem you state the receipt looks fine as if you know my signature and take it to childish online responses which shows the level of maturity you have. Probably should let a competent manager run the store instead of you maybe they'll know how to hire honest drivers instead of criminals who steal from their costumers.",
