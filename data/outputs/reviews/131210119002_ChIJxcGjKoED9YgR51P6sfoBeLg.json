This is the third time that they have either 'run out of food' or 'closed' after my order has been placed and the money received. I've called and I spoke to someone once...who relayed that they had run out of food, at 8am in the morning. Okay.... other times they just let the phone ring. Today's order was my last from this company. Once placed, the order was accepted and I received the \"they're working on it\" notification.  Then they sent me an \"update order\" option because they didn't have any of those food items. As I'm updating, the store closes. So now my coworkers and I have to wait for the money to be restored to my account. This 'restaurant ' is ridiculous.  What restaurant,  dinner, or food stall runs out of food first thing in the morning? Order at your own risk.... it'll be kicked back more times then not.",

They had rice that looked like it was overcooked, filled with cheap green beans and corn bits that look like it came out of a 75 cent can. (if you are going to run an Asian style resutrant you have to get the rice correct).  The quality of the meat was gross. I got the pork, very bland, super chewy with lots of tendons.  The sides they had to go along with rice / noddle bowls were Asian slaw (that was okay) and things like black beans, shredded cheese, and pico de gallo (the tomatoes looked like they were poor quality and super watery, could see through the slices they were so transparent). How on earth do beans and shredded cheese go along with Korean glass noodles?  My expectations for lunch catering is never very high, but this was by far the worst restaurant to ever come through the Foda program.",

However, lately the customer service and the people working behind the counter are not at the level they once were. I came in and was told that lunch wouldn't be served until noon due to a large order. Totally Understandable. When I come back, I had three people that work there, yell at \"We ain't got no fried chicken\". Then when I called to find out how long it would be until it was ready, I got three people yelling so loud, that I was able to hear them in the back thru the phone! When I arrived, I asked \"Do you have fried chicken?\" I was meet with a hard eye roll and then she nodded her head. No verbal yes. I got an attitude for asking a valid question. Customer service has gone down. Also the cashier and cook were about to fight each other the day before!",

But the ingredients you can choose from is where things get interesting, and its what makes this place unique and awesome.  You have a variety of korean/southern fusion proteins and toppings to choose from, such as beef bulgogi, pickled daikon, and KIMCHI PIMIENTO CHEESE (yes!).  Everything I tried was delicious.  Though the burrito/bowl bar seems to be the obvious choice, they also offer a variety of other entrees that are cooked fresh to order, such as a bulgogi philly, korean fried chicken, and quesadillas.  I had the fried chicken sandwich (which comes with fried pickles on it), with added daikon and kimchi pimiento and it was fantastic.  The sesame fries are also sweet deliciousness.  I highly recommend this place for something different!  Also, the customer service is stellar.  The employees are more than willing to tell you about any ingredient that might pique your interest,  and they are just friendly in general.  Thanks!",
