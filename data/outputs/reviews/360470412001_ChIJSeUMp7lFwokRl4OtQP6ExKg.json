It took them an hour and they couldn\u2019t find my address - my food was cold AND I was missing a platter after having the man who took my order repeat my order back to me.  I called and they were not sorry said it\u2019s on the way without even confirming my address.  It\u2019s now 30 min later and I have yet to receive the missing platter ( my guest had to share the meal)  I then called and asked about it and again not sorry and continues to say \u201cit\u2019s on the way I\u2019m busy\u201d...  He hung up and I called back and said I want my money back. The man reacted as though he didn\u2019t hear me and just repeated his \u201ctacos Lopez\u201d I say I want my money back and he then hung up on me.  They are still calling me asking for my address after I even texted the delivery man.... the first time.  I placed my order at 8:26pm it got here at 9:25pm  Called to complain at 9:26pm and it is now 10:04pm  And still no platter.  Just another phone call asking for my address and yet again I was hung up on.  Rude. Unprofessional. Unacceptable customer service.  So sad because We love their food & we respect the hustle.  Stick to one truck or Get it together guys.  Never again.  Update** 10:30pm and still nothing... just ANOTHER phone call asking where my address is.  Oh and I\u2019m speaking in Spanish....  They are acting like they can\u2019t find my address and I honestly don\u2019t think they are going to deliver....it seems as though they want us to just give up and let them get away with being this rude and unprofessional. Guess who\u2019s getting dressed to get her $ back ? \ud83d\ude43",

They would also steal money from you at night thinking you came from the nearby bar. And when you think the workers are okay, they would say they don\u2019t have certain dishes but, then would give that same dish to their next customer. Average food though",
