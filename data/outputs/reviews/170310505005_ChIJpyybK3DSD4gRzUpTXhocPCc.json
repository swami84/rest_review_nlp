The food was on another level and we ended up buying 4 bottles of our two favorite wines.  The patio was heated and nearly all the tables were covered by an umbrella. We had the best seats in the house at the bar which was decorated in fall and Halloween theme which created a cozy and charming feel.  We came prepared to conquer the cold, but in the end, we left all of that in the car.  Can't recommend this place enough!",

The brussel sprouts were decent but not the best we\u2019ve tried. We tried the candied bacon and deviled eggs and both were unique and tasty. Reclaimed\u2019s wings were smoked and some of the best I\u2019ve had in terms of flavor, moisture and texture.  For entrees we tried the lamb burger and venison loin medallions. The venison was so tasty that as soon as my girlfriend tried it she asked to trade before even trying her burger. It really was phenomenally good and this place is worth trying if only for the venison. The lamb burger was well executed as well with a nice Mediterranean flare. The party was moist and rich with lamb flavor.  All in all a properly good experience. The only two things I would recommend changing would be the dim lighting and the venison really should have come with a sharper serrated knife. The flavorful food and service made up for these shortcomings and I will absolutely be returning ($6 Old Fashioned\u2019s on Tuesday dont hurt either).",

The food I've had had been very good (try the scallops and polenta!) and the cocktails are inventive and well-crafted. They often have live music and the choices are excellent. The monthly Beatles Brunch is particularly fun.  But. While the service can be excellent, I've had just abysmal service there as well - forgotten orders, unplaced orders, unclear who is helping you, can't catch anyone's eye, etc. Nice people but perhaps not all trained waitstaff.  The commitment to music is great, but there isn't really a great space to set up there so they move them around a lot. Plus I've seen a lovely jazz duo playing right under a TV showing high-school basketball. Pick a lane.  Overall, recommended. Has a chance to be a bit more.",

We started with the brussel sprouts and corn & crab fritters (they're really just crab cakes, but they're really _good_ crab cakes) and loved them both. The brussel sprouts were soft and slightly charred with a light drizzle of cheese. When it was time for the corn and crab fritters, we were astonished that they were really full of crab and delightful! The lemon aioli complimented nicely without overwhelming the senses.  I went for the Reuben (on regular toast because rye should be outlawed) and my wife did the lamb burger. They were both fantastic. I had to take half the Reuben home because they give you so much corned beef! The lamb burger was served medium and was not dry, filled with flavor.  Our visit was punctuated by the helpful, friendly service of Lindsey. She was funny and helpful, but never really doting.  We will be back for sure! This place is relatively unknown now, but should blossom into another \"must visit\" venue in the St. Ben's subdivision of our North Center neighborhood.",
