The tapioca dumplings were bursting with flavor, and it had a little heat at the end to round it all out! The beef cheek was quite flavorful as well and the sauce went well with it. The curry was delicious and had a very rich/umami flavor. The beef tongue was the only dish that didn't blow us away but was still good.  As for the drinks, we had the hanumanh and the toucan sam. Both were quite good. The toucan sam was very tropically, as you'd expect. Some drinks come in a fun container.  The food comes in small plates and most dishes range around $13-$16. 3-4 dishes filled us up as a group of 2 since all the dishes, except for the dumplings, came with rice.  Will definitely be back for the food alone!!!",

I started with the \"blooming mushroom\" (I learned it was a battered enoki) with fermented tofu and tamarind salt. Funky, sweet, sour and salty. It was a bit much for one person because of the richness and flavor intensity. I followed that with grilled pork jowls. There's something you don't find everyday! Also, rich and tasty. For those whose taste is less adventurous, the menu has dumplings and coconut curry. Note: their menu changes fairly often. I chased the richness with an unusually refreshing, spicy cocktail called the Som Nahm Nah (\"you get what you deserve\"). If they had a few more items like Lao salads or noodles, I would have given 5 stars. I will check it out again when I'm in DC and need to escape the tourist scene.",

I was comfortably filled by splitting five dishes between three of us. -The service was attentive and quick. They brought each next dish when we were a minute from finishing our current dish. -The decor was lovely, especially the epic painted story-book walls.  Cons: -The price was high for how little food we got. You would never leave this place with leftovers. -The stools at our table were very impractical, with no comfortable way of sitting in them.

Oh and here is a request...make the food like momma makes it. Don't overthink it, fancy it up or add ingredients that don't belong....and add some heat for goodness sakes!  P.S.

It was tasty but not the least bit hearty. Just like really really good fried stuff with not enough of this so called tofu sauce. The drinks, however, were creative and delicious we had the Hanumanh which was so interesting. And also had the gin drink with the pineapple syrup. Can\u2019t remember the name. Really solid drinks. Didn\u2019t taste the alcohol but had a nice buzz going.  The coconut pudding dessert was interesting. Light, refreshing and not too sweet. I wouldn\u2019t get it again though.  Also important to add some of the prices for things were a bit absurd.  I probably wouldn\u2019t go back there if it weren\u2019t for the interesting drinks. Perhaps when they rotate the menu in the future I will be drawn to the food more again.",
