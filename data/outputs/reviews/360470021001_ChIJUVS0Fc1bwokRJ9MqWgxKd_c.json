        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Bit lost with so many options in the Time Out Market, just stopping at the Little Ada because I always liked the hummus tahini. We decided to try a different hummus and opted for the sweet potato. We bought two pita breads to go with it. The breads were fresh and warm, a delight to accompany the hummus, which was without doubt the best I have ever eaten. We ordered one portion only and it was more than enough for two people. When the bread was over and we went shopping he kindly gave us two more for nothing. Very polite and friendly. I'll be back there for sure!  (Original) Meio perdido com tantas op\u00e7\u00f5es dentro do Time Out Market, acabei parando no Little Ada porque sempre gostei de homus tahine. Resolvemos experimentar um homus diferente e optamos pelo de batata doce. Compramos dois p\u00e3es pita para acompanhar. Os p\u00e3es estavam frescos e aquecidos, uma del\u00edcia para acompanhar o homus, que foi sem d\u00favida o melhor que j\u00e1 comi. Pedimos uma por\u00e7\u00e3o apenas e foi mais do que suficiente para duas pessoas. Quando acabou o p\u00e3o e fomos comprar mais ele gentilmente nos deu mais dois sem cobrar nada. Muito educado e simp\u00e1tico. Eu voltarei l\u00e1 com certeza!",
