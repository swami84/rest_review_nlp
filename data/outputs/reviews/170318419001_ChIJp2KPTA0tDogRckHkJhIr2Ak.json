The burger tastes pretty normal and not anything special. Still there are better options in greektown. Also more drink options please I am stuck with soda all the time.",

        "caption": "Yeah I don\u2019t know about this one chief.  The food is exceptionally bad. The experience begins when you walk up to the counter. You have to place your order with a woman who\u2019s had a fair amount of interactions with the tooth fairy in her adult life. The food options are fairly minimal, which would be fine if any dishes on the menu were edible. My burger tasted like something between frozen beef and salmonella. I\u2019m fine with a frozen burger at a $9 price point, but it has to at least taste good. I wasn\u2019t here for healthy food, just tasty food, and they somehow failed at both. Personally, I\u2019d be embarrassed to display such ignorance both in customer service and the food I\u2019m feeding people. Definitely not the place to go, even if you\u2019re absolutely starving. You\u2019re better off getting a bagel from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.  Edit: Went back against my better judgement, considering it\u2019s been several months since my original review. Can\u2019t say anything has changed. Dare I say the food was worse than I remember it.",
