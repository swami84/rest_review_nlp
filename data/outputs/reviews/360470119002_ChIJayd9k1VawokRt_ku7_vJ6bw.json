The hostess was warm and welcoming and made sure to take each persons temperature, staff are all wearing masks, and they strongly enforce the mask policy with guests as well.  We had the braised short ribs with mash potato, butternut squash ravioli, and the grilled octopus everything was delicious. I highly recommend and will be back soon to dine indoors.

Yes I get it we are are in challenging times due to COVID but this is not how you treat patrons who are PAYING for the meal. Not only did we have to deal with this, the food took about 40 minutes. I mean we only ordered pizza and pasta which are quick dishes.  The food was basic....marinara sauce was bland. My 9 year old daughter makes better sauce.

Which is a good sign!!  Food incredible, wood fired pizza that you can see them make from the dining room. Oven is the centerpiece of this restaurant and they make a bunch of dishes inside there other than pizza.  Had the wood oven mussels, really nice tasty and extremely fresh. Loved it so much we order another.  Pizza is crisp with airy crust and just the perfect amount of charring. Check out this one that we decided to take home with us. (Photo attached)  Really a must try. We will be back!",

From their wood fired pizza to their fresh made pasta you can not go wrong.  Try their fritto misto (fried calamari and shrimp) just the right amount of crips with a lightly spicy maranara sauce to accompany.  Or their grilled octopus (OUTSTANDING).  For pasta I have been enjoying the housemade Cavatelli in the wild boar rag\u00f9 and the strozzapretti with sweet and spicy sausage in a vodka sauce. Both really well prepared I can not choose a favorite out of the two.  Dessert a must try is their famious Italian cheese cake. Fluffy, light and melts in your mouth.  Don\u2019t even get me started on their metro pies! You will just have to see it for yourself! \ud83d\ude0b  Check it out you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
