We had wings as part of our appetizer which were smoked and then fried adding to their outstanding taste. I opted for the Peach Pork Belly burger for my entree. As a self proclaimed burger aficionado, this one checks all the boxes. A great blend on the burger itself with a nice mix of salty and sweet between the burger and the jam. This burger sounds different on the surface but is well worth the adventure. Overall we had a great experience at Parkside. It\u2019s a bit off the beaten path in Lafayette but well worth the trip.",
