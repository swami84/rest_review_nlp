I have been traveling here and eating at moon wok  for years.  My daughter who lives in NOLA now is a frequent flyer at moon wok.  The charcoal pork chop dinner is excellent and very reasonable.  Actually you cant go wrong eating here especially if you want to pay what food should cost and not the jacked up tourist prices.  Love Moon Wok!!",

The rest of their food is actually the worst I have ever had and it pains me to say that because it's cheap, in a great location, and the employees are amazing. The veggie tofu and shrimp lo mein are terrible. The sauces are watery with no flavor and taste really weird....there isn't enough soy sauce in the world to help it. I'm pretty sure the lo mein is actually spaghetti. Gross spaghetti. I haven't eaten all day and I'm just going to make something else at home. It's all going in the trash. This breaks my heart.  I got the crab rangoons as well previously and they had this sweet, weird cheese in it with an odd texture and no crab at all. It tasted like old cheesecake filling and the dough was rubbery.",

But this place has been here for a long time, past hurricane Katrina. They know what they're doing. I stayed there for much longer, and watched Sharknado movies of strangers, and I connected a lot to just random people who love the food.

I don\u2019t know what brand they use, but the rice was very mushy at top, and hard at the bottom with brown remnants from the RicePot with a few lonely pieces of what I think was green onion.  Second attempt. Same thing.  I appreciate this business for being a form of affordable Asian cuisine in the French Quarters but pls. Owners/Chefs not at the price of ruining the culture and experience for its supports. Invest in a better rice pot, quality rice, ingredients and bang! I\u2019ll be back.

The amount of time it took for this kid to argue how busy the restaurant was, he could've told the manager about 30 times that there was a call for them. Once he finally got someone, (spoiler, it wasn't the manager), the woman he got told me they'd refund me for the soup withing 20 seconds of conversation. I gratefully accepted the refund, and then told her she should check the soup so nobody gets sick. She then said, \"We have sold out of it and nobody has complained besides you.\", yeah,  because that's believable.",

I don't know what they're thinking. We ordered their lomain and got angel hair pasta. When we called regarding this, they tried to tell us they've always used that. NO, Lomain is the type of noodle. If it's not Lomain,don't call it Lomain. They're a frustrating last ditch of Chinese food cravings, but you're better off ordering from someplace that consistently provides what they advertise",

I'm a huge advocate of small restaurant / hole-in-the-wall establishments, and I know everyone has an \"off\" day, but man they were bad.  By bad I mean, aweful / dirty ambience (which can be overlooked since this IS \"The Quarter\").  Food that will put you in the hospital.  Seriously.  I ordered a beef Entree.  Fortunately the lack of seasoning caused me to notice (from about 3 feet away) the sour smell of rancid beef.  It seriously smelled like something died in my bowl. I am a huge fan of traditional Asian meals (I am Asian and was raised on Asian food).  I was too self conscious (I know, I'm a dumbass) to send it back right away. Alas, it was so pretty and well-plated that after 2 unsuccessful attempts at ingesting this rotting corpse, I had to send it back.  I ordered a sandwich instead.  Well now, here I am after having spent the following day with \"it coming out at both ends\".  Yeah you know what I mean.  I live alone with my son, this is the only meal we haven't eaten together (thank God -I usually cook at home).  Doc says it was definitely something I ate within the last 48 hours.  This place sucks.  Hands down.  If you want to attempt suicide by \"the Hershey Squirts\" I recommend this place.  There are plenty of other Chinese/ Authentic Vietnamese in town.  Try any of the places on Decatur (Samurai Sushi / Ginger Lime, etc.).  Seriously, you've been warned!",
