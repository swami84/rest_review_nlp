        "caption": "A lovely taco spot inside Domino Park, right on the East River. It\u2019s a lovely spot for some al fresco tacos ($4 - $5) and margaritas ($10) or beers ($7). There are only two vegetarian taco options (cheese and mushrooms, or a double cheese taco with crispy cheese) but the elote ($5) and guacamole & chips ($8) are also meat free. The elote has a nice kick to it, the tacos could\u2019ve used a bit more seasoning but the hot sauces provided are great and the self-serve limes and radishes are a nice touch.  If you want to avoid long lines, go there during the week - I didn\u2019t have to wait at the cashier and my food was ready in less than ten minutes. Super friendly service. Thank you :)",

What I mean by this is, I ordered one taco initially and I asked for the price of the drink just to see if I would buy it or not. I decided not to and just and just get a taco, next thing I see is the cashier (person at the window taking your order) open a bottle and hand it over to me. I was in awe and extremely grateful. With receiving this service I want to tell Tacocina continue the good work and continue hiring such great staff.  P.S.- I would just lower the price a bit perhaps 2 tacos per order for maybe 6 dollars per order. Its a bit too little per order for the price you are demanding. Other than that, you have great food, great service, and a great location somthing every restaurant should aspire to have.",

It's located right along the water in Domino Park. I love the beachy sand vibes that it has going. What I didn't like is that there was literally construction going on right next to our table. It seems like they were making more tables but literally had the tools left right there will people are eating. I ordered drinks and tacos with queso and guacomole. The chips were insanely salty as well as the queso. I wasn't really wow'd by my drink. It is definitely a nice spot but they really need to do better. The cashiers were really nice and pleasant.I hope this place turns around;  I'm definitely rooting for them!",

While the views and location are truly the star of this no frills eatery however a few dishes do the heavy lifting for the restuarant. The standard taco offerings are slightly above average but provide fun twists that offer options for all diets. If you are going to order one item off the menu make it the Cojita and Monterey Jack taco which features a crispy cheese shell with gooey cheese filling, arguably the best thing at Taco Cina. This isn't a destination worth a special trip alone but when combined with Domino Park the synergy makes it amazing.",

Why the restaurant is receiving only one star is because of the careless attitude they took towards my girlfriend's shellfish allergy. We were very clear with the young lady taking the order that there was a shellfish allergy in the order and we double checked all of the items she ordered to make sure they were all safe. One of the members of our group ordered a shrimp taco, and we asked them to make sure that it was separate from the rest of the food. When we went to the window to pick the food up, the shrimp taco was sitting on top of the rest of the food we had ordered. When I attempted to ask them to clarify if care was taken to make sure her food was fine, they casually passed it off and said it was fine. My girlfriend, who is not all that sensitive, wound up having a reaction to the rest of the food.  I would recommend avoiding the restaurant if you have any sensitivities or allergies. We were extremely excited for the experience, as we love Danny Meyer's restaurants, but this was an extraordinary disappointment and brings up many concerns about their care and attitude towards allergies, which can be life and death for many.",
