For $11, it's very well worth it. My husband ordered the special of the day: reuben sandwich with kalua pork, he loved it. We got there at 2pm so it was their happy hour. Ordered a crab dip as appetizer, tasted amazing. Will definitely go back and try more food.",

Amazing flavors, good balance of poke components, good serving size, and great choices. The menu tries to be extra hip, but that was the only sign of it being part of SALT.  I'm very very picky about crab dishes, but the crab dip appetizer was AMAZING. You CANNOT get a higher quality crab dip on island. They use REAL crab at an amazing price. The dishes were super tasty, as was the drink we ordered. The specials are well-designed, and the poke is to die for.  The staff is great. Everyone on the floor is attentive and helpful. Shaun was our server, and he could not have done a better job of watching for each tables pace and needs. Our waitress was also very attentive, without being overbearing or repeating the common trope of \"first mouthful of food asking how everything is.\"  Seriously could not be happier with a poke place.",

Another insider tip are the daily \"Cultivated LOCALS\" lunch specials - Chef Reids' gravies are delicious.

So to find a restaurant that did just that is amazing.  We had the yuzu ahi poke which blew our taste buds away!  Okonomiyaki fries, spicy smoked salmon dip and crispy wings were top notch.  The drinks were delicious!  Who thinks up the combinations?  I had a Momotaro and it was just divine!  We were getting full already by the time dinner came out.  We had the Tan Tan Noodles, Kalua Pig Fried Rice and the Lechon Kawali - no one talked.  There were a lot of pointing and \u201cmmm\u201d noises coming from our table.  What was surprising was my picky kids ate it all.  Did I say this was a birthday dinner?  So out came the dessert.  The Mini Malasadas with Horchata Ice Cream.  OMG!  Our eyes rolled into the back of our heads.  Now the kids are fighting over the dessert.  Please don\u2019t wait for a special occasion to go to Redfish.  The place was amazing!  Not only was the food amazing but the staff was top notch and the chef and his team of magicians we cannot praise them enough!  Thank you again for a great birthday dinner and beautiful family memories.",

Mono Poke was my favorite place that we ate at in our 4 days on the island. We ordered from the Happy Hour menu. The Poke Platter is a must order item, as well as the Crispy Wings. I could have done without the fries, but they were good as well. The Poke Platter came with 3 different proteins, cucumber and fried wonton chips. So dang good!The fries look good from the picture, but it has an interesting taste. Not a fan of the sauce. The Crispy Chicken Wings are a must order too and the pieces are quite big. There was just so much flavor in every dish.  The front of the restaurant is a poke bar where you can get a bowl to go. I imagine it would be great during the day. I noticed that there was outdoor seating, so it would have been nice to eat outside too. It's clean, spacious and the staff are friendly. Worth checking out if you're in a hurry or have time to sit down for a good dining experience.  Plenty of street parking in the area. I remember there being mostly metered parking.",

What a strange name for a business but I made the connection to the color of top quality ahi tuna and potential poke bar since this place is associated with Foodland Farms.  As we approached the entrance of Redfish, a worker handed us a menu on a clipboard so we could see what they offered in their new establishment.  Walking in, we were met by friendly workers behind the huge poke bar that features 8 ahi tuna aka redfish poke styles as well as hamachi (Japanese Amberjack) and salmon poke all made from FRESH, not pre-frozen, fish.  For non-meat or fish-eaters, there is a vegan beet poke and a vegetarian tofu poke. But, speaking of different poke styles, there is even a pipikaula (Hawaiian beef jerky) poke.  At this poke bar, you can customize your poke bowl or choose from their Signature Bowls.  There are 10 choices for unlimited toppings.   Prices range from $11 to $14.  This front area is mainly for TAKEOUT meals but there is a small counter where you can sit and dine.  In addition to takeout poke bowls, you can purchase any of the fresh poke by weight like at a fish market.  Being curious about the advertisement of their full bar and restaurant service, we roamed to the backside of the poke bar where we found the cocktail bar and gregarious bartender.  You can order your cocktail or beers on tap as well as a quick bite to pair with your beverage at the bar.  The quick bites being offered are selections like okonomiyaki fries ($8) to   P\u016blehu short ribs (16).  We were seated and proceeded to order several small and medium bites and washed them down with a couple of locally brewed beers.   The poke can be pricey BUT they use fresh from the fish auction fish nothing is frozen.   They also make the poke in small batches so the product is fresh and not over-marinated or over seasoned.  Redfish is a fun place to come in to sit and grab a beef and/or cocktail with some great tasting local snacks.",
