When my wife came back 15 minutes later the same female manager told her that she aleady gave her the pizza. Wich was not true since it was still on the holding shelf behind the counter. The female manager started insulting my wife in fron of my 12 year old son, using inflamatory language. Even though the manager relized her mistake and dropped my order on the counter she continue to insult my wife. We have never experienced such awful treatment  at any other dominos  location but this one has serious management problems as it has not been the first time of poor customer service at this location",

Around 10:15pm someone from the store called and told me that they hadn't even started on my pizza and it would take another 2hrs if I wanted to wait. I don't told them to just cancel my order. The second time I called in the order and placed a meat lovers pizza and cheesy bread. The pizza came and it had NO SAUCE! It's the first thing you put on a pizza how did they miss that?? Needless to say I won't be ordering from them again.",

Meanwhile a group of maybe 3-4 employees are standing around talking in a circle one of which keeps looking at me and i keep looking at him because he looks like he's going to come help me but then he just keeps goin back to the conversation he was having.so im standing there for a while girl still on the phone employees still talking the girl starts calling for mohammed she calls him a good 7-8 times before getting an answer and she's asking someone if they can get him but they continue their conversation finally Mohammed comes and she explains to him What was happening on the phone and finally this guy comes and takes my order.later on the girl has another problem with another customer and again she's calling mohammed and when he comes i realize they both have headphones in their ears im like maybe that why she had to call him so many times before  Anyway i say all that to say the customer service here is horrendous the deliveries take forever and i live literally 3 blocks down this place needs to completly retrain the staff",
