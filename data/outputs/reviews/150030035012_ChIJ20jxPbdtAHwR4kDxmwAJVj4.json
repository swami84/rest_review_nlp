The food is a little pricey for an izakaya but it was delicious! Our servers were nice and attentive despite service being a little slow. We went on a Saturday night so they were probably busy.  The food selection was good but since they just opened recently they seem to not have anticipated the amount of customers as they were out of some menu items that day.  They had a good selection of drinks but the chu-hi I ordered seemed like it didn\u2019t have much alcohol.  Their menu selection is really nice though, and atmosphere was good. Highly recommend if you like Japanese food. Will come back for the matcha roll cake.",
