The last time I visited here though on 6/11/19 I ended up getting violently sick a few hours after eating their Thai Peanut Chicken salad for lunch. Was out for approximately 4 days so I suspect something was tainted in one of the ingredients or there were some unsanitary preparation/handling practices from their made to order station. Will never visit this place again to avoid an episode like that in the future.",
