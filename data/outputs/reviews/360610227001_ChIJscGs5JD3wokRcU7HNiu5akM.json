I tried the prosciutto with tomato and mozzarella and it was nice and fresh, tried the lamb and it was beautifully cooked with even temperature on both pieces, which is a sign of a skilled chef. Service might take some time, usually for me that knocks down the rating to 4 stars but I understand that things are not the same since the pandemic, other than that a nice restaurant with great atmosphere. Make sure to check the back area, it's quite and relaxing if you want to enjoy a conversation",

The front outdoor seating area however borders the pedestrian outdoor space and can get distracting. There was a birthday party happening 10 feet from the restaurant's front outdoor space. Also a group of people were sitting very close to the restaurant tables and I was confused for a moment because I thought they were having dinner, but realized they pulled up a table and some chairs and were just hanging out a few feet away from some diners.  The food is meh. Truffle fries were a good texture, but only got a few pieces with truffle oil so that was disappointing. The frittura di pesce (fried seafood) appetizer's texture was good, but it was made of frozen seafood. Mussels tasted fishy and disintegrated in my mouth. For an $18 appetizer, you're expecting fresh seafood. The pulpo was actually cooked and seasoned well, although a small portion. The linguine al frutti di mare was bad!  They used the same frozen seafood mix that they used for the frittura di pesce and the sauce was very basic tomato sauce with few distinguishing flavors. Again, at $23, they can at least afford fresh seafood... And it wasn't even linguine (it was spaghetti)! Pasta was cooked well (al dente) but was a boxed pasta (which would be fine if they didn't use cheap frozen seafood mix).  Service was overall just ok. The waitstaff was very nice, however service was very slow and we had to go find them to put in a dinner order.  I'd come back for drinks and maybe an appetizer, but would not recommend a full dinner service.",

The moment my friend entered the lovely, intimate, warm L'Artista.  there were amazing aromas (,the short ribs with rosemary).  The owner, Frederico, was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and wine offerings, and the history of that slice of Hamilton Ave.  The mushroom lasagne was delicious, the nutella tiramisu something I'll be craving my next return.

Met a wonderful bartender who made the most exotic cocktail with mezcal. Very surprised at the refinement of the menu.  Had dinner and started with their grilled octopus. My mouth watered as they took it off the grill. Once I took a bite I was sold. Succulent and chard in all the right places. Continued with their 10oz burger and ate it rare. It was amazing.  Whole experience made me smile. Glad to see Sugar Hills developed a smooth and charming dining scene. If you are looking for a new spot that delivers L\u2019Argot is the place.  Have gone back several times since and experience the same hospitality. Their wait staff and bartenders are knowledgeable and serve with tendered kindness.",
