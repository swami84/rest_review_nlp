We decided to give them another chance, so we ordered chicken biryani and Vegetable biryani with shrimp in it. The chicken biryani was so oily and spicy and it also had many bones in it. The chicken itself was bland. The vegetable biryani and the shrimp was so bland and the shrimp looked kinda raw. We tried to exchange the food, but they refused. We will never give this place a chance again and will probably go to Wok and grill or bbq nite.",

Most people have Sundays off so they should be mindful about having a speciality available that day. Anyway we were told we could eat the buffet which was almost done and was now cold. They were kind enough to offer us fresh naans and kheer since it was totally done. they gave us some kheer from the back which was spoiled because it had an odd sour taste so we sent it back. They gave fresh kheer after that. We ordered a la carte as well and went for a kebab roll and bihari chicken boti. Both were average. Their saving grace were the Paaye. My parents loved them so the two stars are for the paaye. I noticed the women on the counter had hawk eyes and were constantly monitoring who was eating from the buffet, who wasn\u2019t and if someone was sharing. Kinda left a bad taste in my mouth to be honest. I\u2019d give it another try for the Shinvari but until then i\u2019d give it 2 stars.",

First off, while trying to order kashmiri chai for me and my friend, i had to wait 10 min, not because there was a line, but just two people behind the counter ignoring me. There was 1 guy and 1 lady both just straight ignoring the customers. When finally ordering 2 kashmiri chai, the lady asks me if I want anything else, I politely say no thanks, then she had the nerve to comment that dont be cheap and try our samosas, I again reply no thanks. What I should've done was take the samosa and shove it in her fat face, but just took my chai and left the restaurant. Another thing, they overcharge for their food, kashmiri chai each is $4 but the guy charged us $5, I noticed this a bit later, had I realized right away I would've complained. This place lacks customer service, honesty and the ability to treat your customers nicely. Rude customer service, overcharge for things when prices are clearly listed on the menu.

In other words one shall not rate a place, person or business per one or two visits or experiences. I have been to this restaurant about 7-8 times so far and I find their food to be authentic, quality and tasteful. Their goat-karahi is better than most and samosa-chaat is really authentic. In appetizers category, Fish-Pakora is my favorite. Their service could be lagging so either order over the phone before arriving and reserving a table or be ready for a slow service with infrequent waiter/ess visits to your table. Environment is good enough to be between a good Italian sit in and a takeout. Furniture is not too comfortable but decent enough. Oh and their Chai (both regular and Kashmiri) are unique and good. I am guilty of being a spoiled brat regarding goooood food from a family & friends full of cooks, thus hard to impress. And wrote this one as a payback to reviewer community as I utilize their reviews on Google and elsewhere many times. U r welcome:)",

        "caption": "Before trying any new restaurant, I'm sure all of us often check it out online to see what other people have said about it. When my dad suggested Al-Nawaab, the first thing I did was yelp it. 2 and a half stars... my immediate reaction was to go oh hellllll nah. 2 and a half stars does not sound like a place worth going. But we were already almost outside (we were in the neighborhood) so we're like sigh, whatever, we'll give it a try based on word of mouth recommendations. My experience in comparison to the reviews I read: SERVICE: Okay, yes. I totally see how they could step up their service. However, I didn't think it was much of a problem if you decide to step back a little and consider that a lot of other desi places are also run in a very similar, casual manner. For example, we had to get up and get our own drinks from the fridges, request our own cups and go to the front to tell the lady we were ready to order before she quickly came over to our table. I guess at a more traditional restaurant you'd expect a waitress/waiter to pay more attention and be at your service but that's just not the vibe I got from this place. Maybe it's because we were a smaller party or maybe it's because our food was served relatively quickly, but I didn't think it was that much of a problem. Just kind of a lack of organization, which could certainly be frustrating for a customer when the restaurant is busier or they have come with a large group. FOOD: So they have some food items at the front of the restaurant that are already ready, and I think they just warm them up and serve. We had the daal from there and honestly is was SO GOOD. Normally I'd be super turned off about the fact that I'm not eating fresh food, but it was VERY good. Aside from that, we ordered chicken handi (basically karahi, it was okay), chicken boti (I forgot which specifically, it was eh), fish tandoori (very good), gol gappe (had to make them yourself which might be annoying to some people) and a zinger burger (actually pretty decent. Not filling though). Could I see myself going here again? Honestly, yes. The place was clean, the food was decent, the service was passable. Definitely not a 5 star restaurant but I do think it has a LOT of potential.",

The stamp anybody can put. if any place is Halal certified by New York shariah board scholars , they actually visit the place and check all the receipts time to time etc that is why they need to certified it first but they wont so i wont trust any one unless they are certified.

I got up and approached the guy on the counter he said will be there soon.  10 mins later a girl came with a pen and paper to take our order.  I asked for menu she said \u201cyou should know what we have\u201d.  She finally got us the menu.  Everything we picked they didn\u2019t have.  I asked for fish karahi they didn\u2019t have.  Asked for beef kabob they didn\u2019t have.  They just had few meals cooked I don\u2019t know when.  Finally we ended up ordering from what they had.  I order lamb chops which came with a piece of lemon and the lemon had someone\u2019s hair on it.  I told the waitress about it and she took my fork from my hand and picked the lemon up and said \u201cbetter now\u201d.  Never returned with another fork.  We were not offered anything to drink.  I got up and grabbed 2 sodas from the cooler.  This place is the worst in WGT entire world. Horrible service dirty kitchen I\u2019m assuming because of the hair.  Food was not tasty.  How could someone eat after seeing a hair in their food. Unfortunately I had to give them 1 star there was not a lower ranking to give issued.  Save your time and money folks eat else where.",
