The broth was bland, it was t spicy at all, the egg was over cooked and cold, 1 piece of pork, and way too much filler ingredients. The bowl was so full of the filler ingredients (mushrooms,sesame seeds, sprouts etc) you could hardly get any broth. They served it with a regular spoon, so that didn\u2019t help. And it wasn\u2019t hot! I prefer my food pipping hot it was warm. For $20 it is not worth it",

It almost dethrones my favorite ramen restaurant because it is that good. Also, it\u2019s reasonably priced compared to the other vendors at Time Out Market. A win-win eat!",
