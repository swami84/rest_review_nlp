The ambiance is great, generally no TV on and always good music regardless of who's choosing the tunes. Their food selection is fun, most generally consisting of the NZ-style meat pies, sausage rolls, and their amazing pretzel with beer cheese. Not a huge menu, but quite functional. There were charcuterie boards pre-COVID, which haven't made their way back yet. Also, ice cream sandwiches from a local place.  Speaking of beer...I guess that's the point many folks are interested in when it comes to breweries. Matt is a true IPA wizard. He mostly makes New England style, and he does them so well. They also do some great, great saisons, good stouts, and pilsners on point. Now that the weather is warming up, too, I'm expecting to see sours back on the menu.  They've done a great job keeping staff and customers safe through the pandemic, and accommodate those who would sit inside (now that it's a thing again), outside, and take beers to go. Really can't say enough good things about this place. Check 'em out!",

They had heaters for the outside spaces which was great when it got a little chilly at night.  Highly recommend and will definitely be visiting again.  Ended up leaving with a case of beer!  Update: closed inside due to MoCo COVID regs - responded by lighting up one of their outdoor heaters and had some new delicious beer. Love this place.",

        "caption": "First off I must say the food selection though limited was very good.  We had a steak and stout pot pie along with a local flavors platter.  Both were extreme good.  Now regarding the environment it was extremely loud and trying to order was very disorganized.  The place may want to consider noise damping pads in the ceiling or upper walls to help with the noise.  It was difficult to even talk without yelling.  That ought to be expected at a busy bar but as a result didn't say much eating.  To get a menu you had to go to the bar and then had to go to the bar again to place our order.  I had to almost push through people to get through the crowd to the bar.  Once you place your order I noticed there was some confusion later in the night when cashing out because credit cards are stored at two registers versus keeping it on file and giving you the card back or keeping it in one location.  Also, after ordering I was given two glasses of beer and an order number then asked to come back for plates and silverware.  It would make sense to me to have a common area for this or be willing to bring it to your table especially if servers would like a tip.  When receiving part of our order our number was then taken before all items had arrived and it was so loud and busy I didn\u2019t expect our final item to ever arrive.  It did but then was asked if the other numbers left at our table were for other orders and everyone replied no.  As a result, the three numbers were taken away.  It was very busy for the space but seems like the place needs to work through better signage for water, reducing the noise especially with medium level music playing in the background and having menus at the tables or allowing for a more seamless way to order.",

The stout was good and not overpowering in chocolate and coffee notes. The pale ale and the 2 IPAs were also good, solid beers.  The meat pies were also quite tasty. I had the steak and stout pie. The crust is REALLY good, flaky and buttery.  I am looking forward to going back again.  The only criticism I have is that they don\u2019t fill growlers, they only do 32 ounce cans (crowlers). I tried to get a grower filled and they said they don\u2019t do them. EDIT: I received a response from the owners and they stated that they don't fill growlers because they don't have a way to sanitize them and ensure that they are not contaminated before filling. Fair enough, I hope that they add this capability in the future so they can keep up with every other brewery.",

I particularly liked their Alfie stout and Birthday Wahine pale ale. Opening with four solid flagships (I assume), was smart and I can't wait for seasonal and rotating offerings. The food options are minimal but delicious; the service friendly and fast. Great addition to downtown Silver Spring!",
