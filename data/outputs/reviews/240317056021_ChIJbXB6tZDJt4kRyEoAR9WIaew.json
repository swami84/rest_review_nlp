The vegetarian samosa was hot and flavorful.  The mussels were prepared in a coconut curry sauce.  For an appetizer there were enough mussels for a meal and they were nice sized with a large piece of meat in each.  I like my mussels served with some sort of bread do drench up all of the yummy sauce.  It did not list that it came with bread.  An order of naan was brought to our table and no one in our group could figure put who ordered it so we all shared.  Perhaps the naan came with the mussels.  The bathroom was clean and stocked.  I have always had good experiences there.  They informed me that they are starting Sunday brunch at their sister restaurant Indique in Cleveland Heights in June.  I can imagine it will be delicious.",

        "caption": "I will not go back to eat at this restaurant. The restaurant seemed nice when we first arrived- based on the decor. We were seated in a  nice room with only one other couple.  When the second person in my party arrived, the hostess did not even address them. After waiting, my friend decided to walk around the restaurant until she found our table. Then the waiter brought us all a glass of water and then we did not see the waiter for another 20 minutes- but there were only two other couples in the entire restaurant and they seemed to have a full staff present. Once the waiter took our orders it took an additional 30 minutes to bring our dinner to us (we didn't order anything complicated). The food tasted decent but the portions were very small and a little cold. Then I went to pay the bill. The original bill did not include a gratuity. When I asked the waitress to apply the discount we had, they took off 30% but added an 18% gratuity. So basically we paid $5 less using the Groupon Reserve which seems a little pointless to go somewhere based off of the discount which is what enticed me in the first place.",

The appetizers which came first were okay but  the main dishes that came were cold and served with no naans.  The naans that came later were cold also.  It looked like the food had been kept  in the kitchen ready to be served but was not brought out for who knows what reasons?! The taste of the food was also not good at all.  We had to call the manager to get fresh warm food for us. I will definitely not recommend this place to anybody I know ever.",

Maybe the restaurant is too big and the ceilings were too high and thus they avoided the intimate feel of other, smaller Indian restaurants.  Service was friendly, at a slow pace but it didn't matter so much.  It gave us more time to enjoy our wonderful meal!",

Service - It was horrible. The lady came and put a basket of naans/bread once and nobody showed up after that. We asked for another basket and it never came, we finished the lunch buffet with just rice.  Food and service was not worth the price..I would avoid it..",
