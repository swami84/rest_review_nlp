Well, this is the right place to try it, because the tortilla is the key of a good taco and Sobre Masa has the most amazing tortillas in New York (well, out of all places I've gone to in the whereabouts at least). We went on Sunday and ordered the carnitas tacos, tlacoyos and conchas. Everything was full of flavor, really well prepared, absolutely authentic Mexican food. Good service, nice and friendly; the atmosphere is so original just like the food. In summary, this is a great place to eat amazing Mexican cuisine; the reason why I don't give them five stars is because the door was open an the place was freezing in a very cold morning. When you go to a restaurant you expect a cozy place, unfortunately the inside was too cold.",
