My vegetarian son loves their veggie options and has great vegan options too. Try them today for a hot good meal with grub hub delivery or walk up now. UPDATE- They've now got a great walk up for take out, just use the street parking in front(2 spots!) walk up and ring white door bell, pay  and in minutes you're on you're on your way back home. Their Walk up gives you a similar experience as the former pick up inside, fast and easy . with the walk up today i got chicken Pad Kee Mao that was good and filled me up.",

I thought that since just every other review here complained that the calamari was horrible, and the owner's responses to reviews were positive, that the calamari would have been improved by now...NO! It is STILL the most inedible \"stuff\" I've ever seen. They were fried until they were completely dried out, and the calamari (IF there was any actually in there) was hard as a rock. Since the owners don't care that they are selling stuff that cannot be eaten, I can only surmise that they are continuing to sell it to carry out/delivery orders so it can't be returned and no refund has to be given. It will always be extra money for them that they steal from their customers because they know the customer will NOT be able to eat it. So, even though the soup was delicious, I'll never order from nor eat in this restaurant again. I do not patronize businesses that deliberately rip off their customers like this.",

Everything on their menu is so fresh and delicious--I have so many favorites, but I highly recommend their crab rangoons, sesame chicken, Thai iced coffee, and the sticky rice with fresh mango, or their homemade coconut ice cream.  Mama Toom is from Thailand, and she and her cooking is the REAL DEAL, no Americanized  Thai or Asian food served here.  The service is pretty good, and even though it's not the speediest (they run on a small staff, but the wait isn't unreasonable either), it's more than worth the wait, and Mama Toom welcomes everyone, treating all of her customers like family.  I've been going there for the past several years, and the quality of the food and service is consistently excellent--HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

The menu is simple and straightforward, with all the familiar classics and a few unique options that aren't as common definitely worth trying. I ordered the panang curry noodles with chicken and was blown away by how insanely flavorful and delicious it was. It's quite thick and not watered down at all, so the flavors really pack a punch. I didn't have any previous expectations but was pleasantly surprised. I like the idea that you can build your own bowl when it comes to ordering the curry noodles, and the egg noodles were a great choice. The noodles held on to the curry really well and had a great slightly chewy texture. I enjoy spicy food, and while this dish had a fair amount of heat, it was just enough that it didn't hurt and was very tolerable. I've never eaten a whole bowl of curry before in one sitting, but I finished every last drop of this. It was that good. The service was great as well and all the staff were really friendly. I highly HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and look forward to my next visit!",

Moderately sweet and refreshing. Excellent crab rangoon, the sauce however was pointless. In a similar way the pad si ew was lacking a general flavor but was prepared perfectly. If you like your veggies cooked crisp an hot with but not dry with no regard to flavor this is a dish for you. Personally I think if I'm going to cook a veggie I want to excite the flavor with it. Duck, I went cashew sweet chili. Absolutely amazing. Upon request they made the sauce sufficiently spicy. Mild and medium are also options which is not always the case.",
