Simple and quick, low key, great food with great portions. You rarely find prices like these anymore.  The breakfast special at $4.99 - hands down, easily one of the best deals and values in town. They don't make 'em like this anymore. Cashier and cook seem to work well together and friendly, low key. They offer a catering menu too! With ample street parking,  you can get a quick and ono breakfast - cheap! Go for it brah! Cannot go wrong! \ud83e\udd19\u270c\ud83d\ude09",

You can park in their structure (first hour is free) or find street parking.  It's a small place with 4 tables or so. They open early and even have breakfast.  The ladies behind the counter were really friendly and nice. The menu has your typical local Korean plate choices...meat jun, kalbi, bbq chicken. They even have bowls to choose from such as beef stew or loco moco. Most plates are $12-$15.  I decided to order a meat jun plate to share with my boyfriend ($14.95). Most Korean take out places, let you choose your vegetables/sides. Here, you automatically get whatever they made. I got kimchi, seaweed, bean sprouts, mac salad and cabbage. The veggies were good and not too salty or doused with sesame oil. But the portion was much smaller than you usually get at other places; you got about half the amount. This was disappointing to me since this is my favorite part.  The overall size of the plate was standard and the meat jun was good. The meat wasn't too chewy or had parts in it like at some places. I liked the meat jun batter too.  Overall the location, food and service was good but I just wish they gave more vegetables.",
