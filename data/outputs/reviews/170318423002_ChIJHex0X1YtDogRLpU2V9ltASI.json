I prefer a slightly thinner consistency to my maple syrup but the flavor was good nonetheless. My main dish was the hot ham \u2018n cheese crepes. They came topped with an arugula salad, drizzled with honey mustard having a glaze like consistency. The sweet and savory flavors complimented each other nicely. My husband had the meat wagon omelet which was loaded with a combination of meats to which he added cheddar cheese. The meat was all high quality with great flavor. He had the house potatos on the side which could have used seasoning as it was not flavorful like the rest of our food. The portion sizes were all large we took home plenty of leftovers. I always appreciate when the waitstaff keeps my water glass and coffee cup full, which they did. I would definitely recommend Stax to anyone looking for a high quality, unique breakfast while in Chicago.",

I am a big fan of their food, they really know how to do breakfast right.  There are so many choices that, you can come here many times and get something every time, and each time will be just as delicious as the last.  We had the braised beef brisket benedict (sauteed with celery, carrots, & onions, with poached eggs & hollandaise sauce on an english muffin) with house potatoes, and the half pound angus burger (with lettuce, tomato, onion, pepper bacon, cheddar & tomato jam) with a side of fries on the first day.  The braised beef brisket benedict was the favorite, and the half pound angus burger was a close 2nd.  On the second day, we had the prosciutto avocado benedict (two poached eggs & hollandaise sauce on an english muffin) with house potatoe,s and the meat wagon (chorizo, fire roasted tomatoes, poblano, queso fresco, topped with pico de gallo & chipotle.  Both entrees are very popular and are served with house potatoes.  Both are really good, again the prosciutto avocado benedict was the favorite.  Try the strawberry and orange juice, it's almost too pretty to drink!  Really loved the decor, it's a modern, bright, open space with an outdoor patio.  I would've given this restaurant 5 stars, except for one exception.  When we sat down on their opening day, I turned my coffee mug around and it had lipstick on it!  It was there before I got there.  This was within the first hour on the first day that they were open to the public.  Our waiter changed my coffee mug for me, but, this is not something I would expect from any restaurant, let alone a new one.",
