I ordered on Door Dash and 32 minutes after the order was supposed to be delivered, not when I ordered it.  That's when I received a phone call from the owner saying he just received my order and was out of fries.  That's totally okay, it happens, he offered me chips or to wait until his fry delivery came in.  I opted for homemade chips.  I didn't expect to get anything for free, but the chips are cheaper than the fries and I wasn't credited for it.  Then 50 minutes after my delivery was supposed to be here I received my  order of the Chick-Fil-Lie salad sandwich, to which I added bacon and mustard.  I got it with no bacon or mustard.  It had NO flavor.  It was just awful.  I was so disappointed.  But honestly, those were the best chips I've ever had in my life!  I'll probably give them one more try to see if this wasn't a fluke, but I just didn't have a good experience.",

However, no one explained to us about the seating situation. This restaurant has a walk up window to order/pick up your food. There are picnic tables outside, but since it's FREEZING, they told us about the seating upstairs. We followed the outside stairs to the floor above the kitchen. It was so super tiny. There was a pub table, a bar with a few chairs, and a loveseat. My friend and I were comfortable, but it might have been awkward/weird/crowded if anyone else had joined us in the sitting room. We were completely caught off guard. So now you know in case you're planning to go here when it's chilly outside. :)  EDIT- I want to add that this place did have really great food and I love that a lot of it is locally sourced! :)",

I had the espresso chocolate soft serve, which didn't have a distinct coffee flavor, but it made the chocolate that much more delish. All soft-serve is lactose-free btw!!! The kitchen was remarkably clean from what I could see from the window, and I visited an hour before closing.  There is seating on the deck to left as well as indoor seating above the kitchen.  My only complaint is that there's no option for a twist cone because of the flavor combo shindig, and ya girl loves a good twist cone.",
