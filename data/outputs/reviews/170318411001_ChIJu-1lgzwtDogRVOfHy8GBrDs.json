Their service and food were absolutely the worst. Their otoro, which is supposed to be the fattiest part of tuna, had the same texture and taste as regular tuna sashimi but cost twice as much. Salmon sashimi was still frozen on the inside and we had to just sit there and let it thaw for 10 minutes before it didn't feel crunchy anymore. This pathetic excuse for a sushi restaurant is nothing more than a bunch of people claiming to be sushi chefs serving the worst quality sushi I've ever had. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TASTE SOMETHING WORSE THAN GAS STATION SUSHI, THIS IS THE PLACE!",

We were seated and got a rundown of how everything works by a waiter. Obviously you can pick anything off the conveyor belt, where plates range from $1.50 to $6.50, or order off the iPad that each table comes with. If you do the latter, a bullet train will shoot over to your table with your dish.  Overall, the experience is very very fun with all the cool gadgets, the restaurant is very clean and modern, and service is attentive. There\u2019s a variety of rolls, nigiri, and appetizers and large dishes such as ramen and poke bowls for those who don\u2019t want sushi. We paid around $20 per person and wasn\u2019t stuffed, so it is a bit pricey but honestly on par with regular sushi restaurants.  As a tip, the $2.50 (yellow) plates with four pieces of sushi rolls are the best bang for your buck! The ramen and bento boxes also look like good deals.",

You pay for the dishes you get from the belt, upon the color of the plate, also you can order from the iPad and get it from the kitchen carried by a cute train (or maybe from the robot -so coooooool-). This place is vibrant and cool, also I don't really find it expensive. Plus, alcohol is a great deal here. Asahi for $5? Yes, please!  Place opened at the very beginning of the year, so it is still basically brand new, so expect to wait to be seated. Good thing to know is that you can join the waitlist here at Yelp to reserve your spot if you are on the way. We did it, but still we had to wait, it was Saturday night! The wait i worth it, no worries.  Sushi was really fresh, a quality is good for the price you pay. My favorite rolls were Fiesta Roll, Boston Roll and the classics Hosomakis (Salmon and Tuna). We got some appetizers too like takoyaki, shumai and seaweed salad. Very good as in their previous location.  The only thing I am not really sure is about accommodating big groups in here, I didn't see any big table. Hopefully they will be able to accommodate big parties soon, so we can celebrate there with friends.  Oh, almost forgot it. Get your rewards card. For every $15 spent you get a point, and when you reach like 10 points you get $25 off from your bill. I just did it, using my card from the Broadway location and got the discount, plus a cute tea cup!",

Worked at sushi restaurants before, and the sushi does have a little too much rice for my taste, the fish is a little too thin, but of course this is fitting for the price. Miso and edamame app were good. Ramen dish I definitely had better but for the price it is very comforting dish, the pork pieces however were very hard and dry and had no flavor, I did take the pork pieces home and fed them to my dogs since they were not salty! Definitely a fun place to go with the train belt and robot!",

The staff takes your temperature when you enter and then asks you to use hand sanitizer if you are dining in. Tables are distanced appropriately. The sushi is delicious and fresh as well as kitchen items. The meal is super affordable and fun experience. Give it shot, you will not be disappointed.",

There's usually a wait, so plan accordingly and try to join the waitlist.  The rotary is pretty fun and custom orders come on a cute little train on it's own track. The inside is vibrant and new, although it can even be a little too much. Most sushi rotaries are more expensive than conventional so I can't complain too much, but this one feels a bit more so, even charging $2.50 for tea.  Sushi itself is alright, pretty average in my opinion. The sashimi is thick cut and tasty, and scallops, himachi, plus salmon nigiris are all pretty good.  Overall decent experience, something cool to try or go to every now and then!",

The sushi was fresh and delicious, there\u2019s an iPad menu at every table you can order specialties from. When you order things from the menu either a robot will bring it to you or the little train on top of the rotary sushi will. So cool!! Super friendly, great service, the atmosphere is fun and the place is brand new and clean. I\u2019m coming back here for the rest of my life for a nice time.

The price range is similar to Korean sushi restaurant. The restaurant design is quite neat and the system to order by train is also fun. As the name suggests a bar, it seems to sell a variety of cocktails and alcoholic beverages. The quality of the rice is a bit too stiff and Nigiri Sushi seems to be made using frozen fish. However, roll rolls and warships are worth eating. There are also bento menus at reasonable prices, so if you want to eat sushi simply, this is the place to go.

        "caption": "This place is just so freaking COOL! Now I have been to conveyor belt sushi restaurants, but hands down this is the best one so far. First off all, the choices this place has to offer is quite vast. Love sushi? No problem! Hate sushi? No problem! They even have stuff for kids.  Not only was the food really good, the drinks were as well. My favorite cocktail was the spicy mango margarita. However, I also had their sake, and I was not left disappointed.  If you don't like what the conveyor belt options have to offer, or you don't want to wait for a while for an option to come back, they also have an iPad ordering system. It's almost worth trying because of how the food is delivered. Once your order is ready, it's delivered by a train!!  Though they don't take reservations, you can easily put yourself on the Yelp wait-list and plan accordingly.  I can't wait to come back!",
