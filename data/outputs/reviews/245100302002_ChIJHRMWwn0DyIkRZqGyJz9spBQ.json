The decor and ambiance of the private room we dined in were perfect for the occasion. Our guests raved about how good the Chicken Tortellini, Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna were. The Limoncello Cake and Tiramisu were light and delicious!  The owner Paul was very acommodating in providing details and amenities that were needed for planning and making it an evening to remember. There is a decorative chair in the second floor hallway that was a perfect prop for our photographer to take photos of my mother and our guests. The restrooms were conveniently located down the hall from the room and were very clean and serviceable. The waitstaff were very attentive and detailed in helping us progress through the planned activities of the evening. Pay parking is located across the street from the resturant which was a plus. I highly recommend Dalesio's for your future dining needs and hosting private events!",

We asked our waiter to help choose between dishes, and he recommended the penne alla vodka e cream and fruitti di marre alla Mediterranea. The linguine sauce was creamy and scallop flavored, albeit a bit heavy. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly and not overcooked. The penne was more tomato flavor than feeling dense. The only critique would be about the dessert tray that was brought to our table. I'm sure it was meant so you can see the options, similar to the artificial food displays in Japan, but the desserts were clearly old and did not appear appetizing. The tray turned us off from wanting dessert.",

Classic, simple italian-like interior - almost as if you are dining in someone's home. Perfect lunch menu - - not too much, not too little. Classic dishes, nothing trendy. We ordered gnocchi, linguini, Mediterranean seafood and ravioli - staples, that if you can't get right, you can't make Italian food.  Everything tasted homemade - I'm certain the pasta is made on the promises. The gnocchi was great, and the marinara sauce is the real deal. The linguini was exceptional pasta, but slightly over-cooked- not al dente. All ingredients tasted fresh. I didn't try the seafood because I'm allergic to shrimp, but that diner said it was exceptional. The real treat was the ravioli - never had ravioli like that!  For classic, simple northern Italian food, I think you will find Dalesio's a real treat.",

My girlfriend decided on this place and at first I was a bit skeptical mostly because there was no other patrons when we arrived shortly after opening (perhaps not many people have time). However I was proven wrong and I was so glad about that.  The interior has a antique charm to it and is well maintained. Although the area ate in was cozy there was another area and possibly an upstairs area.  Our server had a little trouble understanding us but he was very attentive and welcoming providing excellent service.  We ordered an appetizer of lobster raviolis and shared gnocchi in marinara and chicken parmesan. The cream sauce the raviolis sat in was buttery, light and just perfect. The raviolis were nothing short of perfection as well. I could tell they were made from scratch based on the texture and consistency of the pasta. It comes with three pieces priced at $13 but was well worth it. Definitely the best lobster raviolis I've eaten outside Boston.  Possibly just as perfect as the raviolis was the gnocchi and the marinara sauce, both of which are made in-house. I could eat that sauce alone being so flavorful, light, not too sweet, and being a beautiful bright red color. A full serving costs $13 but seems like a steal to me.  The chicken parmesan was very good priced at $13. The breading was excellent and the chicken was juicy. It was served with the same marinara sauce and pasta. Had I only order this I would still be very impressed with the restaurant. As we left the owner, I presume, dressed in a plain white t-shirt and jeans personally asked us if we enjoyed the meal to which I profusely thanked him.  Overall, if you want quality Italian please make a stop to Dalesio's. I will be coming back.",

While we were there, a fight at Mo's Seafood (restaurant directly beneath the balcony) broke out, there was a lot of screaming, and the cops showed up. NOT a good environment for a relaxing dinner. When we arrived, there was no silverware on the tables, we received bread with not napkins or plates... and again when the food came out, it was a sad excuse of italian food.

Everything went extremely well. The appetizers and wine were ready when everyone showed up.  The wine was outstanding and flowed well. The pace of the evening was great. We were not rushed. Everyone enjoyed themselves. The food came out at appropriate times and temperature. And the food was OUTSTANDING. I hate to put this online, but the food is incredible for the price you pay.

The fresh seafood wrapped in homemade pasta topped with an awesome creamy tomato and basil sauce was delicious.  We decide to stay.

We had stopped by the night before to look at a menu, chose to go somewhere else, however we were remembered the next night. Ordered a appetizer, the vegetable soup with Maryland crab, very large portion size and quite delicious. Had three different entrees, one seafood, one vegetarian, and one veal - all very delicious. Had a great dessert (panacotta) with wonderful espresso. Would return and recommend to friends!",
