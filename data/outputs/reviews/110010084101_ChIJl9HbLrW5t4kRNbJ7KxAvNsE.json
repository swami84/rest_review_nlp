I ordered the Fried rice combo which came in a very small portion with hushpuppies that are a dollar a piece that came out cold plus the sweetest coleslaw I've ever had in my life. Our reservation was at 4pm we  didn't get our food until a hour and 30 min later. We were put at a table by the bar that rocked back and forth like a see saw. The manager saw this and said not one word but was quick to replace a chair missing a piece on the leg at the table next to us meanwhile my red drink just rocked right off the table onto my brand new all white shoes and he never said a word. Didn't care about our experience and displayed no concern what so ever. The food was great not enough but still great the prices are ok in some areas and excessive in others. Our waitress was at least amazing but this was not a great first experience  for us.",

Even the sausage wasn\u2019t cooked all the way  The crab legs were perfect and all my extras (potato, corn, egg and broccoli ) were just OK. It was later in the evening around 6pm and busy maybe the people cooking food was tired and ready to go. I MIGHT try this place again and eat in. Oh, the 2 hostess at the door (on 3/21/21) were super nice and sweet .I\u2019m a New Englander and I know and LOVE seafood, they need a little bit more practice. Like I said I will try again and eat in at an earlier time maybe things will be better. BUT, try the place yourself, everyone has different taste.",

Me being from Maryland and growing up cracking crabs and peeling shrimp since knee high I wanted to see what it was all about. I visited the the DC H street location with a few of my friends this past Saturday. We made a 4:30 reservation and we arrived at 4:50 because of DC traffic. We where told by the host at the front door that every reservation has a 10 minute grace period and that our table had been given away and that we would have to go on the waitlist to get a table which would probably be about two hours. I requested to speak with the manager (His name was Johnathan) he came and spoke with us and was very professional. He made accommodations and had us seated in 10 minutes. I ordered the Cajun pasta and I also ordered the Lil Boss Mukbang Bowl. When I tell you the seafood was some of the best I\u2019ve ever had!!! The flavors and spices where amazing! I highly recommend this place to all true seafood lovers!!",

Placed an online order that stated I would be able to pick my order up at a certain time\u2014 arrive to the establishment and waited an additional hour for the order. I drove 1 hour and 45 minutes for horrible service. I could have flew to Florida in the time I waited for my order. When I called in to question the website/wait time discrepancy, the young lady laughed at the fact that they were behind and the website was grossly inaccurate\u2014 per her words \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to tell you\u201d.  When we received our food at 11pm (order placed at 9pm, order was supposed to be done by 10pm) extra items we ordered and paid for were MISSING, food was cold and one of my crab legs were empty. There was no way I was going to ask for my extra items because waiting any longer was unimaginable\u2014 so we chalked the loss and left.  I went to the Brandywine location a few years back and had a good experience\u2014 but because of this H street experience, I will take my business elsewhere.. $100 wasted.",

Tonight\u2019s service had me so heated, I NEEDED to leave a review. If I could give half a star I really would. I work in the food industry and know what its like when it gets busy and how to tend to customers even in our busy time frames. Upon arrival, I was initially told the wait would be no longer than 30mins, so me and my friend go for a stroll while waiting for a text. After 35mins or so pass, no text. We decide to go back to Crab Boss to check in and see whats going on. Multiple staff members and hosts pass by as well as other guests, no acknowledgment. After 20 or so minutes of waiting, the same host who initially came out to add us to the wait list asks if we had a reservation. We clarify that we had already been put on the wait list over 40mins ago. The same host then seats a couple that comes after us stating they \u201chad a reservation\u201d so the table that was set for us was just taken by them. My friend and I are understanding and decide well, its alright we can wait. Another 15mins or so passes and we are finally seated after waiting a little over an hour. As we sit, the area is still wet from cleaning products that smell as if the rags used have not been rotated or clean. We had one fill of water and no waiter comes to the table after 20mins or so.No waiter served us the entire time we dined here. I get up, walk over to the bar and ask a gentleman who was kind enough to let us know he was not our server but was able to place our order. We waited for another hour for our food to come out. Within the hour we waited, there was no service provided. No refill on our water was provided. When our food arrived I was so shocked to see a small basket for 22$ with 3 small crab legs, shrimp, small corn, and 3 little balls of hush puppies.. blew my mind that it took a whole hour to prepare this dish. My friends food came out and it was cold. I will say the food was delicious especially the crab fries, that is what made the meal good. The service was definitely horrible, even if your are a busy establishment and with all the staff that was seen catering to other customers and seeing if they were alright none were present at our table. After we finished our food, we thought we\u2019d give the establishment the benefit of the doubt and wait for our checks. 15mins later, I walked to the bar to ask for our check. Upon leaving, then and only then did two gentleman speak to us with customer service. This establishment did not have good service, their food was good but not worth the bad service given.",

The key is the sauce and they got it right.  Other places typically don\u2019t put much effort in the sauce; mainly buttered old bay or that other nonsense to add to high blood pressure. Crab Sauce is not some seasonings with just butter; your sauce should be well blended with no granular traces. Crab Boss has given crab sauce dignity again\ud83d\ude0a Nothing was watery or discolored in my Lil Boss combo.  The shrimp was a generous size and very fresh.  The sausage was different, generous portion, and had a nice kick. You could tell the sausage wasn\u2019t that processed like kielbasa is. I prefer the small red potatoes however you won\u2019t complain about not having enough potatoes.  The potato is basically half of a baked potato.  The corn was excellent; it didn\u2019t taste like it sat in water all day long.  The crab legs were a nice size and meaty.  You must order the Scallop Rockefeller; especially if you\u2019re not an oyster person.  All in all this is how a good low country boil should taste and be enjoyed with friends \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe P.S.

The manager rudely comes up to us & says I can\u2019t have y\u2019all standing right here due to COVID they may shut us down. Ummm you\u2019re right I shouldn\u2019t be standing here because I made a reservation and should be at the table you all should have reserved when confirming my reservation. Seeing that we were all getting upset, they took our number down to call when a table was available. 10 minutes later we get a call that a table is available. Not only did it take an hour to receive crab legs... mine were cold & orders were messed up. Idk if it\u2019s just this location or what but never will I be visiting this establishment again.",

She also ordered the catfish platter and she said that was good. My oldest daughter ordered the crab legs and lobster platter and the broccoli was basically raw which she said should only be in a salad so she wasn\u2019t impressed either. My husband ordered the shrimp and crab cake platter and said it wasn\u2019t really good at all. Lastly two drinks were ordered and when the order was picked up, no drinks were included. He had to go back to get the drinks and you would have thought something free would have been given to him because he had to go back but nothing was offered. All in all it was my birthday and I was very disappointed because I chose the restaurant. I feel what keeps people coming back to a restaurant is the great food and the exceptional customer service. I feel like the mark was missed today!!!",

I will say that the food that we did receive was good, but I would not order again because of this situation.",

I had made reservations for the rooftop and upon arrival, I was told that they overbooked so we couldn't sit on the rooftop. It took a very long time for our server to come to our table initially. And once we put our orders in, we had to wait over an hour for our food to be brought out. And when it was brought out, two of our orders were wrong. And the waitress never really checked on us to see if we wanted anything else to drink or anything while we waited for our food. They were very lax with people wearing their mask correctly or at all with both customers and employees. The only saving grace was the food and drinks. And someone from the kitchen brought us out free shrimp for the wait. Other than that, this place was a total let down. I even felt like the owner's apology was just lip service. It didn't feel genuine at all. Particularly because he gave the same exact speech to the table next to us. You come to a restaurant for the ambiance and the experience. And we just didn't get that on this visit. If I ever feel like having Crab Boss again, I'll just go to their MD location for take out and eat at home.",

I ordered 2 crab cake platters, broiled oysters and crab fries with extra crab (for 7 more dollars) and I must say I am UNIMPRESSED!  I was expecting the crab cakes to be prepared MD styles with less filler. After eating some of what I had,  I would never suggest anyone order the crab cakes as a sandwich because eating it as is supplies enough filler (very bread-y).  In my opinion the crab fries were just okay.. the \"alfredo\" sauce is powdery tasting and I'm still searching for the crab amongst the sea of soggy sauce drenched french fries.  If y'all want delicious CRABBY-crab fries go to \"Be Claws\" in Hyattsville they've got it down pat!  Lastly the oysters were okay but the amount of cheese used was a bit off putting.  This oyster experience reminded me to NEVER trust a charbroiled oyster outside of NOLA!!  The hush puppies were good though.  All- in-all everyone has different taste, for me Crab boss missed the mark. I'd only eat it again if someone was to treat me, but give it a try for yourself these are just my thoughts.",

Their beautiful rooftop is a close second to their food. I got the Half Boss while my wife got the catfish plate and we shared a Seafood Mac & Cheese. All of it was savory and delicious. The cherry on top was the friendly staff and great drinks. Since only the rooftop is open, we look forward to seeing the rest of the restaurant when it opens. I can already see this being the new hot H street spot. Thanks Crab Boss!",

We are all paying the same prices so why should we be treated differently.",
