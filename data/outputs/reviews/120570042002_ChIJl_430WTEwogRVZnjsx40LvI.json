The mac'n'cheese was good, but I could tell that someone different made it and that shouldn't be. Also, the broccoli had waaay too much sauce and was slightly overcooked and the collard greens were also not the same. #2 I ordered the chicken and it came out just barely warm which  is unacceptable. My friend wants to go back, I'm sceptical, but will return to try it out again. Pics are from 2 different visits",

About 45 minutes into my wait time they proceed to sit a group without reservation and when I ask to speak to the manager the hostess says \"we don't have a table for you\" (I am unsure what the purpose of a reservation is then....) The manager then tells me that they didn't realize they sat another group and that i was waiting for an hour (poor internal communication). Needless to say the customer service here is subpar.

Today was a beautiful Florida day to be outside and enjoy, and that is exactly what happened. First off the Flight of Mimosas really took me in. I had to walk it off and drink water for the rest of the afternoon as I was pretty buzzed. There was a blackberry, lemon/citrus, watermelon, and then my favorite strawberry rose!!! Our service was pretty amazing. Hats off to Joshua and his A one service. He was very friendly and even though they were out of the appetizers of our choice, he went and asked the chef if they could make a fresh batch for us and sure enough they did. The chef came out and hand delivered it to us and took a bow! We felt special! My first time having monkey bread, and happily took the rest home! This was my first time trying eggs Benedict let alone it being over a pork belly and biscuit but it was sooo flavorful. There was no need to add any salt and pepper. Then came what my special guest tried... a loaded up corn flour pancake with pulled pork, coleslaw, onions, topped with a lemon maple syrup and smoked butter... LOVED IT! So many flavors in your mouth it was explosive. Everything was so fresh!!! I truly recommend this spot if you haven\u2019t went always. This is a hidden gem for sure.",

Cut into our steaks, cold in center...extremely rare .both the tables next to us had already sent their steak back..and we really didn't want to but had no choice.  The picture shows how my steak came back...burnt to a crisp on the outside..the manager placed our steaks down and walked away, not a single word.   Our bill was $151 !!!!

Waiter was far from energetic and substandard compared to first experience.  Food was okay, but not worth the price point of $100+ per guest.  I highly recommend you place a filter on your ice machines.  My mixed drink smelled like fishy Tampa water and killed the drink flavor.  I said something to the waiter and he simply said \"sorry about that.\"  Guess its normal.  Fortunately, everyone else in my party drank wine.  If you go, I recommend you either get wine or get a drink without ice.  Wife and I both agree we won't be back.  Not worth the price point...especially if your looking for something a little more upscale.  Unfortunate...because the location and atmosphere are great.",

It arrived with a underdone gummy skin, completely inedible, so my server graciously took it back to have the skin cooked longer.  It came book looking much better however, they cook the meat on a wood burning grill which made the taste completely overwhelmed the flavor.  The manager came over and apologized and asked if I would like something else.  I ordered the rack of lamb, and had 4 tiny ribs, and also completely charred by the grill and took a bite and all I tasted was char. I took 2 bites and left it on the table.  Everything is ala carte, and the side broccoli was also charred from the grill.  Paid 200.00 with tip and left hungry.  My suggestion to the proprietor, you have beautiful cuts of meat, you should give people an option if they want it cooked with our without wood.  I would have loved to taste the flavor of the meats.",

Have to say they did an amazing job, you can tell by the taste and that they all the time wear gloves or wash hands. Also To see the manager/owner all the time looking around to see that everything is OK is not something you see in all resturant . Defently high class. The service is more than beyond wow.

For appetizers I  highly recommend the Buffalo cauliflower and the goat cheese tartine. My husband had the duck and he loved it. I had the Mac n cheese and Brussel sprouts and they were also Devine. The only thing I can say to improve is that when you box someone's food for them please include everything that was on the plate. The duck came with ribs or bones as garnish? I guess they had fat on them my husband wanted but they were not included in the take home box. Some cultures enjoy that fatty bones.",

The food runner Zach really impressed me when he dropped our food and explained everything on our plates. I've never been to a restaurant where a food runner was knowledgeable about the menu! Overall all, the food was great, service was great, and staff was great down to management! As someone in the industry as a manager, I definitely give this restaurant 5 stars. Great work guys!

        "caption": "The hubby and I came here for our anniversary dinner after being frequent Armature Works fans.  We made a reservation and when we got there a few minutes early, they were ready for us.  We were seated in a little bay window seating area which was perfect given the reason we were here; very cozy and quaint.  The vibe of the place is very industrial modern, but still warm and inviting.  We started with drinks with The Steelbach and You Look Mauvelous.  The Steelbach is very refreshing; champagne bubbles tickle your nose and it's a nice fruity flavor.  You Look Mauvelous was much sweeter with berry flavors and more of an adult fruit juice which can be dangerous.  The way their menu is setup is to order an entree and then to order sides that are big enough to split with your table, almost tapas-style.  My hubby ordered the lamb which came with two different flavored salts; one regular sea salt and another of cilantro with a cream sauce that when you put them all together is the most heavenly and tender bite of deliciousness.  The scallops were also amazing.  They sit on top of a sweet potato puree and when you dip them in it, it's a perfect blend of sweet and savory.  We ordered the roasted carrots to share which were awesome.  They're sweet and crunchy, and just like I like to make them.  For dessert, I don't like chocolate, so my choices are usually limited.  I was surprised to see that they have a hummingbird cake.  If you've never had it, it's the same texture as a carrot cake, but with more fruit inside and it has nuts on top, usually.  My hubby had never had it, but I love it since I'm not a chocolate fan.  He fell in love with it.  The frosting was creamy, but not heavy.  The candied nuts on top were a perfect bite of crunchiness and the cake itself was perfection.  We ate the entire thing.  There was nothing left on the plate.  On a side note, our waitress, Missy, was awesome.  She was so knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  She helped us out with every step and gave her opinion on everything with heart.  You can tell she really believes in the products they're putting out there.  If you're in the area, you MUST try this place out.  It does get pretty packed, but it's worth it.  Make a reservation, come hungry, and leave with a full belly and a happy food coma.",

My gf ordered the mimosa flight that had orange, carrot, strawberry and cucumber mimosas. We loved it and the interesting idea of different juices with champaigne. I had the pork belly eggs Benedict that I really enjoyed . She had Nutella stuffed French toast that she thought good. The bacon was fatty and maybe not cooked enough for $5 as a side seemed steep. I love the ambience in this place. Really cool lighting and fixtures and bottles of booze everywhere that really give it an authentic feel.",

The grapefruit juice was like cheap koolaid. Not Florda grapefruit for sure. The bbq pork on corncakes description sounded delicious! But the dish lacked much flavor, the pork was dry, had no smoky flavor at all and minimal bbq flavor. Cole slaw very bland. Extra bbq sauce was super sweet/no tang. The corncakes were good, but added to a dry dish. It was missing 'something' that could make it mouthwatering. Perhaps it should start with a decent portion of juicy, smoky, bbq pork. I would try another dish some other time. But it might not even be remembered as a place to try again.  Updated: Its a popular brunch dish? I did not see a photo posted. Thank you for responding,  but it was not reservations I had that was an issue.",

Service was good although it would have been nice to be offered fresh pepper upon receiving our meals, as other tables did.  The food?  Blah.  For $65 the steak should have been at least close to what we buy for ourselves and cook at home (for much less $$$).  For $28 my 1/2 chicken should taste at least close to what I make at home (organic whole chicken feeds my entire family for under $12, Publix), but it was dry without flavor.  If my potato side had goat cheese in  there, it couldn't be tasted. I don't know what was up with the \"shaved corn\" or whatever that was.  Couldn't cut the pieces so picked up one with my hands - good flavor. The kids (21 and 16 respectively) had scallops and the mac and cheese.  Son said scallops were good and they were.  Daughter enjoyed mac and cheese, but claimed mine from scratch using the quality cheese I use, purchased at Fresh Market, is better. Attitude by dude that was packing up leftovers was horrible, as polite as we were to him he just wouldn't acknowledge us. When we are sans kids we may try one more time and sit at the bar for apps, but I'm sorry guys, but for just shy of $300, (including three beers, three wines and two mixed drinks) I'm going else where for a nice dinner.  Server Jack should be commended for being polite, punctual and pleasant.",

I had a hand made chorizo and pickled stuff charcuterie board kinda thing as an appetizer, my Wife got the filet mignon, I was thoroughly impressed. Our waiter (whatever is P.C. nowadays) was Josh, and he was perfect.  We never had an empty glass, and the food came out hot and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend Steelbach,  don't be surprised if the manager stops by to see how your meal went, and bring your appetite. You don't want to skip dessert. Tonight was my first visit, and I'm absolutely coming back to see what the menu has next time. (Locally sourced food and rotating menu with local veg is what I think they're specializing in. I know our steak was Florida sourced, and close by as well) Highly recommend... Have a special night out!",

Perhaps my choice to go with 3 was influenced by the fact that we happened to recently dine at several restaurants that are truly far above average, so it was hard for me to give Steelbach only one less star than such true excellence. I actually hate giving any less than a good review when there wasn't anything necessarily wrong, per se, but I hate being dishonest even more, so here it goes. We had the duck and red potatoes and the food was good, not great, and I'm not even sure I'd describe it as above average at all. We've had far better duck, and potatoes aren't terribly difficult to get right. Honestly, the best part of our experience at Steelbach was the well above average service from Peter. In fact, while I tipped okay (25%), I regret not tipping more because our check was small since we had a big, late lunch and ordered light for dinner. Anyway, just being completely honest, my main impression of Steelbach is consistent with my impression of Amarture Works overall, which I consider a hyped-up mall food court that's perfect for pretentiousness and appearances of quality, class, etc., but light on actual quality, class, etc. By the way, I happened to sit facing the open kitchen in Steelbach and I don't want to go into detail, but would just suggest that they remember that guests seated there can see everything they do and don't do before serving our food off that counter (just to be clear, I am not referring to our server who was excellent and did nothing to make me question our food).",

I was concerned because they said they could not give me quinoa, or corn, or most vegetables because they were all pre-prepped. A restaurant should not be a fast food already prepped place. Steelbach does not make food from scratch in their kitchen. I was given a dish with my main allergy on it which was onions. They told me no onions were in there. I thought I was eating fennel. Once I ate into it, I questioned them again, they brought it to the kitchen and then said it was onions. I was sick in their bathroom, immediately had to down emergency medication, started to swell up, got red, itchy, rashy, and very sick. My eyes were swollen and face....etc... This is serious. I don't think I will ever want to go to ANY restaurant after this. How can this even happen? I gave them an allergy card. How can they even stay in business. I've even been there before. Don't go to this restaurant if you have allergies and want to live. Don't go to this restaurant expecting a real chef that's culinary trained. I think they just have cooks. Don't go to this restaurant if you think you want to eat fresh, made from scratch food. I've eaten here before and the food was great and they were able to make me food without onions in them. I don't know what happened to them. I left only leaving a large tip for the bar. I obviously was not going to pay for being poisoned. Luckily, I was am ER nurse and had ALL the drugs I needed and this time so far didn't have to go to the ER. I'm still having the reaction, so I might need to get injectable steroids if my pill steroids and pill antihistamines don't work. Even my head itches. I did loose some weight in the bathroom though. They did offer to call an ambulance. The male bartender was beside himself with what happened. He was compassionate and extremely apologetic and could not even believe this happened to me. If you want to go to Steelbach, drink at the bar only, they won't kill you there. They have skilled, compassionate bartenders.",

Wait staff and managers were very attentive and did a great job of taking care of our group. Had a family style service for appetizers,  salads and sides. Entrees were per person and I had the 30 oz Tomahawk ribeye. Fantastic! Cooked perfectly medium rare. Restaurant was busy and loud. We valet parked which was $10. Regular park and walk was $5. Located in the Armature Works complex. The area was very busy. We had a good time.",

The ambience is warehouse style with a room full of people trying to talk over each other (very loud and they could use some sound dampening features as it just reverberates). We ordered the deviled eggs to start and they were very good. 3 of us ordered the fried chicken (have heard so many great things about this chicken) and 1 ordered the paperdelle. We also ordered the poutine to share. The poutine was awesome, great flavor and I loved the duck. The paperdelle was also very good and well prepared. The fried chick unfortunately came to the table burnt. We had to wait for them to cook it again and once they did it was very good. The manager was very apologetic and accommodating. Offered us some popovers and a round of drinks. The popovers were interesting, not sure I liked or disliked them. Let's just say I found them unique. Overall the place has good food and accommodating staff. Tough to compete with Ulele a few feet away from its doors, but they do a great job of carefully designing their menu to be different.",

After being seated was were told that seats where reserved so we would have to move to the lounge area. After sitting in the lounge area of the patio to it took almost 20 mins for us to get a menu. After getting the menu the server then proceeded to let us know that we can only have drinks and  no food. To the left of us there is the same lounge seating where the party visibly lighter in complexion than us was being served food.  My cousin went to the manager to ask how come the other table was receiving dinner service but we were told we couldn\u2019t not eat in that area. The manager who seemed confused or embarrassed maybe because he was the same complexion as us then proceeded to then advise us we can eat at were we where seated.  When finally getting the food it was horrible overpriced steak with no taste. I left to have a smoke when I got back the server advised some other people than they can seat themselves in my seat where my plates from my meal still was there.  Think twice going to this restaurant especially when it\u2019s busy.  Thanks but no thanks.",

My wife misunderstood what she was ordering (avocado salad) for a more traditional salad, but it was more a Tapas plate of avacados and other various vegetables. When the server noticed she hadnt really enjoyed the plate (really due to her own misunderstanding) she immediately took it off the bill (which we ended up paying back via her tip).  In addition, my wife and I, from Illinois were looking for a recipe for an appetizer that we thought was amazing. I creepily hunted down people who worked there on linked in and connected with an individual asking if he would be able to share said recipe. He responded within an hour to the strange request of ours which is thoroughly impressive (didn\u2019t give full recipe but basically told me how to figure it out through google) Would recommend to anyone visiting Tampa for either business or vacation!",
