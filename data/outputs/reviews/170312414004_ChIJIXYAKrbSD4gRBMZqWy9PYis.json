I guess the other server realized and he started to take care of our table. Another thing is the main course came so fast and the server took our plates away before we finish our appetizers. Besides that, I tried different Turkish restaurants, but this is the only one serves only one adana kebab kofte and lots of pilaf on the plate. You might be new, that's why I rate 3 to leave room for improvement. Thanks for everything anyway!",

        "caption": "I decided to eat at this restaurant by looking at google reviews. As a Turkish person, I was so excited to learn that they might be really good Turkish restaurant nearby my hotel. We ordered Lahmacun, Cag kebap and iskender. Honestly, the Lahmacun I had at this restaurant is probably worst Lahmacun I have ever had in my life. Real Lahmacun dough is supposed to be very thin but Lahmacuns at this restaurant are so thick almost just like pizza. Bottom of the Lahmacun was little bit burned but top of the Lahmacun was not cooked. The top part was still like uncooked dough. Also, real Lahmacun has good amount of ground beef. When I was eating the Lahmacun, I felt like eating vegan Lahmacun. They probably put very little ground beef and put too much vegetables. And the vegetables had no flavor neither. It didn\u2019t have any spicy flavor at all. \u201cThe chef \u201c of the Lahmacun should look up how to make Lahmacun on internet. They can learn it on the internet. The second food we ate was Iskender kebap. Which was not good either. Iskender kebap is made with PIDE bread , gyro meat, source and butter and yogurt. They were too lazy to make pide bread for the Iskender kebap. They literally used loaf of bread that you can not use for Iskender. Their Iskender meat was not bad. But the source they put on top was bland . And another failure of Iskender was the yogurt they served with it. Yogurt is supposed to be thicker just like Greek yogurt. But the yogurt they used was not good at all. It was bad. The third food was Cag kebap. Cag kebap meat was actually good. It could be better but after Lahmacun and Iskender taste, I would say Cag kebap was good. However the bad part was the rice and yogurt sauce. The rice was too much and had no flavor. I littered only ate the chickpeas. Yogurt sauce was really bad. They should add some good hot sauce. Overall I think my experience was bad. After I paid the bill, I left. When I got to the my car, the waitress come and asked me why I didn\u2019t leave tip and gave me the bill back and made me to leave her some tip. In total, I paid $70 for 2 Lahmacun, 1 Iskender and 1 Cag kebap. Probably Worst restaurant experience in my life.",

We ordered  mostly dishes containing salmon and we felt pleased. After leaving the restaurant, we found out that our car had a boot because the person monitoring the parking lot made the premeditated assumption that we were going to some other place (if you deviate a few degrees to the left from the restaurant's door that's enough to get a boot). He didn't bother to check if we entered to the restaurant.  Despite we left restaurant with some leftovers and showed him the receipt, he still continued justifying his initial assumptions instead of removing the boot. He was so coward and dishonest to admit his mistake that he kept blaming us and he ended up charging us (stealing!) $170.00 dollars to remove the boot. We are NEVER coming back to this place after such a horrible service. If I could give negative stars to this place, I would give it negative stars.  You can't have a sustainable business by being so rude, dishonest, disrespectful and stealing money from your customers. You could have had a loyal customer and now you only have a very displeased customer; someone who is never coming back.",

On last day 3 hours before the departure of my flight,  we said let's go one more time to  cafe Istanbul with my wife.  While we are in the uber i called them to give the order.we already know what we are gonna  eat.  Despite my insistence on the phone they did not receive my order.  I told them about my flight to another state and i told possibility for late arrive to airport but they did not help at all.  I didn't like what they did to the customer who just visited them 1 day ago and returning one more time.  I was also extra sorry ,so as a Turkish. I talked them on the phone and try to convince them with my own language,  but they  didn't trust me...",

Not that I'm a seasoned vet in this area, but this place easily puts out the best food I've had in Chicago and tonight was one of the best meals I've had in a long, long time.  Was here for a rehearsal dinner in which we got to sample nearly the entire menu and nothing was a let down. All the.meats - they are all great. My faves were the chicken, and whatever they call these lamb lollipops. That bed of delicious rice.. Mmmfph. The Turkish flan - so good. The cheeseless pizza - also great.  The kicker of the night, surprised me. After being stuffed with far too many courses, and I've reached a point to where I've eaten so much food that I can't stand to take another bite, came the baklava. Hands down the best baklava I've had in my life. Not too sweet, superbly balanced.  The only thing that outshown the quality of all the home cooked food was the service. Everything was top notch and these guys are doing everything right. The only downside is the AC was out, and the restaurant was pretty hot on a day like today. I will absolutely come back the next time I'm in Chicago.",

From the moment we walked in we knew we were in for something special. The renovations have taken it from a cold open room to a warm, inviting place to relax and enjoy some truly spectacular Turkish food. We were greeted warmly at the front desk, and even though we didn't have a reservation we were seated promptly. We started with some delicious and complimentary hearth-baked bread served with a yogurt-garlic-carrot dip that was to-die-for. For an appetizer we split the SU BOREGI, homemade dough filled with feta cheese and fresh dill, served with fresh dill and creamy yogurt garlic sauce. This was reminiscent (to me anyway) of a Turkish-style kugel. Very hearty and satisfying. For our entrees we went with BRAISED SHORT-RIB, red wine and fresh herbs, served with soft polenta and ISLIM SARMASI, Braised lamb shoulder, wrapped in eggplant, served with basmati rice pilaf. OMG so good and so tender! And the portions are enormous. We had to take half of our food home to enjoy another day. Note that the short rib takes about twenty minutes to prepare, but it is definitely worth the wait. Prices are reasonable and the staff were friendly and welcoming. We highly recommend Cafe Istanbul and can't wait to return.",

I really appreciate when your server notes a distinct flavor profile of something that people may not prefer (ie: I would have not enjoyed my drink if our server had not pointed out that what I was going to order had a strong licorice taste). It is a small space, that didn't feel too crowded as much as cozy.  The food was seasoned very well and eveything was so fresh. I could be happy eating just the rice- it was so good. I ordered the lamb shoulder kebab and it was excellent. We also had the zucchini 'pancakes' which were more like fritters and they were delicious.  I'm pretty sure you could order anything and it would not disappoint.  We were too full to order dessert but it is nice that you can see food on tables near your and the desserts looked intriguing. They serve a muffulletta style bread with eggplant that just begins your meal on a high note and it continues from there. It always warms my heart when people understand how to properly season food. They also have a good amount of vegetarian options- too. And there is even a parking lot! Definitely going back and I can't wait to- either.",

All exquisitely prepped, deliciously tasty,  well presented, moderately priced, very easy parking, knowledged & attentive servers, not to mention that this is a quite nicely furnished locale with white table cloths and comfy seating.  Plus, very good selection of surprisingly satisfactory Turkish wines.  There is also an adjoining nice cozy, relatively well stacked bar within the restaurant facing that amazing open wood fire pit where you can eye witness the horizontally stacked marinated rotating lamb/beef \"cag\" kebab dripping and lightly spreading out-of-this-world aroma!  An open invitation and challenge of; Try Me!  Simply put, that alone by itself is the epitome of carnivorous dish that must be experienced by all meat lovers. Two words; outrageously delicious.  By the way, there are also numerous tasty dishes to satisfy vegetarians as well.  In essence, it was such a pleasant surprise to finally experience a really enjoyable, well layed out, attractively furnished Turkish restaurant in Chicago.  Ohh, don't omit the omni present Turkish coffee with kunefe desert to top it all off and whether you ask for it or not, they will serve you a cup of Turkish tea on the house!  Bon appetit.",

The food was exceptionally delicious and fresh The lamp chops are on my top of my list, so delicious so tender and juicy, Doner and Adana kebab were also very flavorful and excellent.  Our hostess Aisulu was extremely nice , she explained us everything about the food since we never had Turkish food before, our server Ferhat was a very courteous young man. We were served with complementary Turkish Flan beautifully presented , which made my daughter's day.  The ambiance was lovely, with Turkish accents, we highly recommend this place  and can't wait to go back.",

Then they surprised us with decadent Turkish flan (see pic) that we tried to eat a polite amount of, not because it wasn\u2019t super tasty, but because we had already gorged on everything in our plate.
