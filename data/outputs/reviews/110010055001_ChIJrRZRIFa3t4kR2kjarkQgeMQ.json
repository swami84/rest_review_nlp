I dropped one star because I think compare to other Persian restaurants in the area offers less generous portions of food as a trade off of  being first luxury Persian in the USA.

The most amazing soup (I think called Ash Reshteh). They were willing to split it for us so they put yogurt on my date\u2019s portion but not mine.  We also got the tomato and feta toast (feta on the side). The tomatoes and incredible olive oil sauce with the bread were so good. The Romaine Heart salad was fine. We got the albaloo rice, which was dry. The bronzino was incredible (I couldn\u2019t help but try a bite) and I loved the spinach and side apricots with figs that came with it. The warm bread they served before the meal was excellent too! The chef and the other owner stopped by the table to say hello and were both so nice!!! We can\u2019t wait to go back.",

Grape leaves in the Doulma were chewy and the dish lacked flavor beyond \"salty.\" Pistachio soup was bland and served lukewarm. Watermelon salad was nearly flavorless and the elements were not well integrated. Lamb stew was simultaneously bland and oddly spiced. The rice that accompanied the stew lacked any flavor whatsoever, in spite of appearing to be infused with saffron.  This restaurant has the ability to be amazing if focuses on flavor and seasoning and lowers its prices a bit. Also, in their defense, I visited on opening night, so hopefully the kitchen can up their game in the coming months. But the current DC restaurant scene is too competitive for this level of indifference to flavor.",
