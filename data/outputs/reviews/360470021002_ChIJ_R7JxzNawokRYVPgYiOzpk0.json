It was super refreshing in a super hot day. Definitely a must try item. I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. The bread was nicely toasted on the outside.

Of course, my FIL is really concerned and considers calling an ambulance. The manager tried to apologize and asked if he could get us anything else. We calm down, order another cava, and, manager brings out some dessert for us along with a cappuccino. He then tried to charge for one of the desserts that we never ordered! The owner came out and, you think he would apologize and make everything better BUT HE WAS REALLY NASTY! They\u2019re supposed to be in the hospitality business!!!

It was super refreshing in a super hot day. Definitely a must try item. I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. The bread was nicely toasted on the outside. I like the service here. They were friendly and didn't seem rushed. Price of the foods are easy on your wallet. 10/10 I recommend this spot to anyone.

Highly overpriced for the quality of food though. Had the baked eggs but it was literally just scrambled eggs in a dish. They charged $14 for this. I literally could've made this dish at home and it would've tasted better. I occasionally get coffee here still out of desperation when i have a shoot that takes me to the triangle out front all day but it's also mediocre and overpriced. So visit if you're a tourist just looking for a snack and want to pay some hefty NYC prices for bad food, small portions, and below average service. Don't come here if you're a local. You know better. Really surprised this is at the forefront of any tourist guide recommendations for dumbo. This place is the epitome of what's wrong with NYC.",

I came today to speak to the owner about his customer service and his staff and he basically told me that there's nothing wrong with his staff but there is something wrong with me. I refuse to spend my money there again and I will be sure to report him to the Department of Health. Everyone is going to know about his crappy staff, terrible customer service and the quality of his food.  There has been more than one occasion where his service staff was extremely rude. They even hung up the phone on me. I refuse to spend my money there again and I have told all of my fellow co-workers who are in agreement that they will no longer order from this filthy, unprofessional \"cafe\".",

Started with a \"Cafe Dumbo\" which I was told is just mocha. Well let me tell you this: that wasn't \"just\" a mocha at all. I drink about 5 - 10 mochas a week and I'm always on the hunt for a new place to try one. When I tell you that this was hands down the absolute BEST mocha I've ever tasted, I mean it. Sweet, but not too sweet, super chocolatey, but not too much chocolate to overpower the delicious coffee flavor. This mocha was perfect.  For the main I had a pastrami sandwich. This New York favorite is very much about preference. There are so many variations of the pastrami sandwich, but typically, your two distinct styles are thin sliced on rye or thick cut on a crusty roll. I prefer thick cut on the crusty took which is exactly what they served up. This sandwich didn't come with cheese and my topical choice of provolone isn't served there, so I asked for it with mozzarella. After a short wait, out it came in all its glory. I was surprised ave excited to see two thick slabs of fresh Italian style mozzarella atop that savory mound of sliced meat. I bit into it and my taste buds exploded! It was editing I dreamed a pastrami sandwich should be and more! I got the mustard on the side so that I could appreciate the flavors of the pastrami, but to have the option of tangy yellow goodness of I so desired. With or without the mustard, it was perfect.  For dessert, the New York style cheesecake. Every bite was perfection. The strawberries were fresh, sweet and crisp, the chessboard was everything chevalier should be, and the thin cake crust was firm and delicious.  I'm ecstatic about my experience at Archway Caf\u00e9 and I intend to make it a regular stop on my Brooklyn escapades.  P.s. If you're lucky enough to have Ryan as your waiter, you'll feel pampered and important. Make this place a stop on your list for sure!",

        "caption": "I'm not even sure where to start with this place. The food was actually pretty tasty, but the service was horrible (not just wait staff, managers too). When we came in, the manager almost seemed surprised that we wanted to eat there. Upon sitting down, the waiter came up within 30 seconds and asked us if we were ready to order. I ordered a sandwich and a side of guacamole. The sandwiches were all quite good. The guacamole...was just guacamole. No chips to eat it with. That's weird. I ask if there are chips on the way and am told by our terse waiter that it doesn't come with chips, and that \"he can bring me some potato chips, but (he'll) have to charge extra since that's not what I ordered.\" Who serves guacamole with no chips? Anyway, our sandwiches were good, however we were never once offered a water refill. Upon bringing out our check, we see that every single item on there is listed as $1 higher than what it is listed on the menu. We point this out to the waiter, who then says \"Oh yeah, we're getting new menus printed, there was something wrong with these.\" We point out that he should've mentioned this, or they should write over the prices on the menus. He literally responds with this \"Yeah, you guys are right, but I can't do anything you know, I'm just a waiter.\" Wrong answer. You go get a manager and have him sort it out and honor the prices on the menu we ordered off of. He did apparently have the authority to add a 20% gratuity to our bill, which seemed generous considering he never once came by to refill waters. Upon leaving, the manager overheard us talking about our experience on the sidewalk. We explained our frustration with the prices, and we were told the same \"Not our fault\" story. (BY THE WAY: There are reviews on Yelp with this same complaint from NOVEMBER. Tell me again how long it takes to get menus printed? This is just a flat out LIE). We said they should have told us at the very least, and he said \"Well, your waiter should have said something, but he was probably in a hurry since we try to close by 10:00.\" I look at my watch and it's 9:57 and we're standing on the sidewalk. From the moment we walked in, they seemed in a hurry to get us out. However, there are NO hours listed on the door, and there was ZERO sign that they were getting ready to close. It's New York City, if you say you serve dinner, I'm expecting you to be open until at least 10:00. If you're getting ready to close, DON'T SEAT US! Or tell us the kitchen will be closing in 10 minutes. There was ZERO indication that they were preparing to close. I work around the corner and will not be returning. Deceptive pricing, rude service, and odd menu (seriously, you ever try eating guac with no chips? It's like eating baby food).",
