The service is by getting a salad served to you behind the counter with all ingredients and dressings and then paying at the end. I suggest you try the \"sobe shrimp\" with honey dijon, but if you want to have it your way, you can order it item by item.  If you are used to eating salads, Portion is on the right size!",

I was starving so I ate it but I dreaded it. I loved the create your own salad option but I think my Salad needed some more TLC in the flavor department, my salmon at least. Fresh for the most part but I could not rely on my dressing or salmon for flavor so it was blahhh which is noticeable in the picture. Perhaps chicken would have been the better option.",
