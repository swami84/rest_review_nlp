We ended up getting mild because the spices are super hot because in the medium they use habanero peppers  (even for someone who likes spicy it's hot). We got two of the chicken sandwiches, some fries, and the loaded macaroni and cheese. It was so yummy, lots of flavor. My only complaint was the chicken was a little bit on the smaller side but overall a great and flavorful experience especially for someone who is from out of town!",
