Twice now we have ordered goat from them, and they gave us beef, or have demanded we pay them more for goat, AFTER we had already paid. We also had 2 orders of wings this last time, and they sent only 1. I doubt we will order from them again, very disappointing. Oh and if you order online or on the phone, expect them to always be late.  Response from the owner a day ago Dear Joseph, I'm so sorry you had this terrible experience. This is not what we stand for. I can't believe this has happened twice. Something is not right. Any chance the person you're talking didn't understand what you ordered? Regardless, this is not acceptable. Please call and ask to speak to the Manager.\u201d  I placed both orders online. Not over the phone, so there was no confusion on what I ordered. The first time you called me AFTER I had ordered AND paid, to tell me if I didn\u2019t give you more money, you were going to swap out the goat with beef. The second time, you just swapped the goat out, without so much as a warning. You missed an entire order of wings the second time, and after I wrote that first review I ended up cracking a tooth on one of the wings.",

It was very flavorful and came with a great hot sauce. My daughter had a vegetarian dish with the fufu, which is similar to mashed potatoes. Next time I would get fufu instead of rice, it is perfect for soaking up the sauces. Prices are very reasonable. The service wasn't stellar, our waitress had a hard time remembering our order and disappeared for long periods of time, but part of that may have been because we were alone out on their (lovely!) patio.",

I went on three separate occasions and today will be the last time I purchase anything from this restaurant. I called and placed my order and the woman over the phone told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got there 15 minuets later greeted the three men who were sitting there and was ignored (no big deal). I went up to the cash register where I greeted the woman. On the website the food I ordered was priced at 8.99 she told me me it was 9.99 and didn't adjust the price as it was advertised online (no big deal just 1$). I sat there and a Caucasian young man walked in instantly the owner who had just previously ignored me jumped out of his seat welcomed him offered him water and a table to sit at. (hmmmm) After tending to one of his more valuable customers I think he felt guilty and decided to come over to me and say \"God bless you\". I appreciate the food I ordered from here and the blessings he offered me I'm also happy I was able to support a black owned business but Ill think Ill spend my money where all customers are welcomed with the same amount of hospitality.",

When I am craving a home-cooked meal and don't feel like cooking, I go here. I've had the jollof rice, limbe beef, roasted fish, saut\u00e9ed spinach, fufu, and I'm sure several other dishes. The food is always fresh and served hot. Mr. Patrick and his staff are awesome hosts. I highly encourage a visit to Roger Miller. #CityExperts",
