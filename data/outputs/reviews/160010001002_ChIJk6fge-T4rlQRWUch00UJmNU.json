Our food came fast. The online ordering made it easier to request food without certain ingredients. My only complaint is that I wish we could have tipped more.

Probably the best thing we had while in Boise. If you are not tech savvy then you might have some difficulty as you have to scan a QR code to get to the menu and order online from your table because they are trying to go contactless. We went to a nearby restaurant the day before and they had their menu online but still had full service which went much smoother. They do add a 16% service fee on the bill which we didn\u2019t quite understand until we saw a sign on the table in really small letters explaining that it was for the tip. That\u2019s totally fine but just not quite communicated very clearly. The service was very friendly though, and they are glad to help if you have any problems. Definitely would recommend if in the area!",

The server was named Zack and had a very casual demeanor. We asked him, \u201cHow is your day?\u201d He responds, \u201cwell I\u2019m here.\u201d \ud83d\ude12 Once we were served, I opened my place setting to find a sticky and dirty steak knife. I let the server know, and he had a nonchalant attitude and said, \u201c Yeah, it\u2019s really hit or miss.\u201d \ud83d\ude33 he brings me a new silverware and AGAIN is sticky and dirty. He doesn\u2019t come back out for 10mins which by then I had washed my hands and decided my hands were the best option at this point. Informed him about the silverware, he says sarcastically, \u201c yeah I wasn\u2019t here last night to make sure it got done.\u201d It\u2019s a group effort of an establishment so his attitude might as well have been flipping me off. Once we got the check we saw a \u201cservice fee\u201d of 16%. My friend and I contemplated just not tipping if they are just going to add on random charges. It wasn\u2019t communicated to us until after he brings back our ticket and cards to tell us that the 16% was an automatic gratuity but that extra tips were appreciated. He didn\u2019t bring a pen because of the current pandemic, yet he could serve me disgustingly dirty silverware, TWICE! This is the first time I have been at a sit down place since COVID and I\u2019m appalled by my experience. Our order of riblets, sweet potato fries, brussel sprouts, and 2 cocktails ended up costing $60. Even without COVID this would definitely not be appropriate.",

Also, when you order on the app, they add a MANDATORY \u201cservice charge\u201d of $10.00 which is ridiculous considering our meal WOULD have only come out to $40-50 had we not finally walked out.

        "caption": "EDIT: Eureka is tumbling. The wife and I were so excited to finally be able to eat out again after the ridiculousness of COVID. After we were sat we were told about their new way of \"Contact-less ordering\". This alone turned out experience upside down. First off, the staff did not explain it very well. Not only did it take forever, its difficult to navigate and customize food.  It's not very specific and it takes the fun out of \"Going out\" IE... the wife wanted a beer, but the menu online has no options other than light beer/dark beer/malty/surprise me. She ended up getting frustrated  with the beer choices so she decided to go with a stiff drink. However, I had already submitted our order online at this point and now we would have to place a whole other order just to get a drink. This would require about 3 minutes on the phone to order another drink....again the wife said \"forget it, they've made it too difficult\". The staff also made it more difficult on themselves not accepting gift cards on the online platform. They had to redo our entire checkout process.  Second to note: The food seems to be going down hill. This was our favorite place to eat in all of the valley. However, it seems that the long COVID break broke the chefs for good. The nachos were lacking any sort of toppings and were incredibly bland. The chicken sandwich was overcooked - the chicken was chewy, dry and when you took a bite the entire chicken slid off of the sandwich because your teeth couldn't bite through it.  On a positive note the staff were always pleasant as usual.  All in all the date night was not very pleasant because of the reasons above. I don't know that we'll be going back anytime soon. They have pretty much killed the ambiance that once made eating out fun and an easy task.  Original Post: Oh gosh, where to start with Eureka....  There is something captivating about this place. It's not overly done in any particular way, but as soon as you walk in the door you're always greeted quickly, the drinks and the food are always made fresh and from scratch. The staff is always helpful and friendly. The people around you are always smiling, laughing and enjoying their visit. I've been here at least 30 or 40 times now and yet to have had a problem with anything. The staff here aspire to put out only the best it seems and it works! This is one heck of a restaurant that I suggest everyone tries at least once! Oh, and don't forget the mac n cheese balls.....",

My main reason for reviewing is the fact that our to-go bag came with a sticker reading, \u201cNext time, put on some pants and dine with us.\u201d Umm... What an odd thing to tell your customers. Perhaps somebody at Eureka thought that that sticker would be funny and witty. Myself and everyone in my party thought it was in poor taste.  I can\u2019t imagine why an establishment would choose to be condescending to ANY customer, regardless of whether they dine in-house or order to go. When one factors in the pandemic and current recommendations to limit public outings, this choice seems especially tacky.  Not that it\u2019s even REMOTELY your business, but pants were on when we ordered, thanks. I\u2019m glad we had the chance to experience this mediocre offering between shifts at work. Our families come to Boise once or twice a year\u2014 now we know to leave Eureka off our list of dining recommendations.",

The place is neither small nor large - it's the inbetween size, not cramped, but also not so large that it becomes sequestered into zones and impersonal. They have a good selection of microbrew beers and ciders, and the $5 happy hour appetizer plates we tried were pretty good (truffle fries and fried cauliflower) and priced right. We also got the classic American burger, which was also fairly good and cooked correctly. We sat at the bar which features square metal stools that are somewhere between OK and a little uncomfortable - but the bar staff we interacted with were all friendly and efficient despite being kinda slammed on a New Year's Eve, so I didn't mind it so much. I will go there again.",

The amount of sweet potato fries we received was a joke, and for an extra $2.50 a pop, was extra aggravating. If I want to spend 50 bucks on 2 burgers and fries, I expect it to be good. I got the fig burger which was good, even though it was cold, but the bison burger my husband got was slathered in overly sweet jalapeno jam which made it really unpalatable. Both burger's buns were greasy and soggy so that was also a let down. Probably wont be coming back after this experience. Pic related was the amount of fries we each got with our burgers.",

The deviled eggs with horseradish are to die for and the firecracker sauce on the hot wings is out of this world. When you bring children they bring their food out first to make sure they aren't waiting too long. I have had a little trouble when ordering drinks that they seem to sit at the bar and the waitstaff forgets to bring it to your table for a long time so it just sits there - on more than one occasion,  however their drinks are to die for and are ALWAYS worth the wait. I have tried about half of the items on the menu and all of the appetizers and have only had one thing I didn't care for. The hemp bowl is my favorite entree, and my husband loves the jalapeno egg burger. It is worth going to try their food just because of all the different options they have that are exciting and so different than other restaurants.  Eureka is really something special.",

We were greeted quickly at the hostess station by a waitstaff, as the hostess was busy, and he took us to our table.  That service was good to start, and just got better.  When ordering a drink, it came out incredibly quick.  You'll notice that it isn't necessarily your server that brings it out, it (appears to be) whoever happens to be near it when it's ready.  Result = NO waiting for your next drink. :)  Food was absolutely fantastic.  We have two kids under age 10, and this was great for them.  Loud enough that we didn't feel like we were being obtrusive to others.  We would definitely come here again!!",

Portion sizes felt smaller for the amount of money I spent, however like I said, tasted great. Had to spend around $25 just for myself tho to leave satiated (5'7, 160 lb guy), and of course I ordered a $14 drink as well so, quite a spendy night out. Did not entertain myself to the bar area but it looked like a fun place to go, watch a sporting event, eat a burger and socialize with a drink. Only rated 4 stars mainly because of the lack of variety in food selection. They did have food for you vegan/vegetarian folks as well",

        "caption": "Just got off a long plane ride with my son and wanted to go downtown to eat and look around. Saw these great reviews and knew I couldn't go wrong with a bison burger.  Went with the cheese fries + truffle dipping sauce for an appetizer and my son found a chicken strip dinner of kids menu.  The fries were good, and my son had no complaints. Needless to say, i didn't enjoy my bison burger.  The bun was cool to the touch (like it was refrigerated??). I asked our waiter if this was intentional and he went to kitchen to ask and he let me know it was not and that they would heat the buns if i wanted.  I don't make a habit of sending food back to the kitchen so I didn't go with that offer I just endured my cold bun burger.  The next thing was I had to pull my red onions off.  I expected them to be grilled with no structure remaining but after taking a couple of crunchy onion bites they had to go.  The other strange thing was there seemed to be 2-3 salt pockets within the meat of burger as ifi meat and spices weren't mixed long enough??  I did opt for the fried MacNcheese bites, instead of fries and I'll say neat concept but not for me.  Reading a couple of reviews I see there is a fan base though.  The host and waiter were very nice and attentive (4PM on a Wednesday so there was only a table of 8 besides us there) so that was a plus.  Also, the atmosphere and location were good.  I'm sure I got a rara bad experience with my bison burge, especially after seeing all the other five \ud83c\udf1f reviews but can't say I'll be back.  Theres just too many other places to eat downtown.",

It is like they didn't really know the flavor profile or how to make it, so they didn't try.  They should probably give up on this menu item...
