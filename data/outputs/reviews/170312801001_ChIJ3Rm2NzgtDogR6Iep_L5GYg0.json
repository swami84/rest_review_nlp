All I\u2019ve tried there was fresh and delicious. BUT my every coffee experience was just horrible!  I should note right away - I\u2019m an espresso type of person, so I prefer espresso-based drinks. Being familiar with the coffee scene in Chicago (from mediocre to outrageous offerings), I can state that my experience in this place has been below mediocre. \u201cBaristas\u201d don\u2019t care about your drinks - it\u2019s all about the speed even when they are not busy. I once ordered a small almond milk latte and received a medium size - while I should be happy for a free \u201cupgrade\u201d - the proportions used to make my drink stayed the same. So basically, I just got more milk. And yes, any plant-based milk MUST be steamed to temperature less than regular milk, but I burnt my tongue trying to drink that coffee.  My final point that made my write this review was that \u201cbarista\u201d forgot to add an espresso shot to my latte!! So she served me just the steamed milk!! REALLY? it was NOT during rush hour! This made me to actually order a \u201chand steamer\u201d on Amazon and never go to Marker Creation for latte again!",
