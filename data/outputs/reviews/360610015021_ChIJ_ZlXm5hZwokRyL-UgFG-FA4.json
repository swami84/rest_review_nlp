Toasties is a small deli and shop by the Duane Reade that boasts a Mecca of sandwich and salad options.  For my inaugural meal, I decided on the blackened turkey with chipotle mayo that just blew my socks off. The hero was toasted (as their name suggests) and was lightly accompanied with cold slaw and cheese. Sitting at my desk, other coworkers remarked on my un characteristically silent demeanor as I made happy faces while enjoying the sandwich.  Prices are decent for FiDi. Today's sandwich plus a bag of chips set me back $10 and change. If all hoagies are this good, I am definitely coming back!",

I ordered their Jerk Turkey sandwich and I was really surprised. The sandwich is lightly toasted with tons of marinated jerk turkey inside with Pepper Jack cheese. It is a huge sandwich and I was really full afterwards.  They only have a few small tables and majority of people just order to go. If you are hungry, this is a good lunch spot for sandwiches.",

The variety of sandwiches is clever yet not pretentious or overly complicated and TOASTING the bread is their thing (you'll have to make sure you ask for it though). The thanksgiving sandwich is great, but I always add a little extra cranberry sauce since I like it on  a hero. There is also the typical deli stocks of juices, soda, water, chips, coffee, etc... But you really came for the sandwiches",
