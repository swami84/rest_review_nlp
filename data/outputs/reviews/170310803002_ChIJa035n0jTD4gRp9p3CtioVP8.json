To my surprise, Chicago lacks late night (past 11pm) options. We chose this place because they offered gluten free stir fry dishes.  We ordered the beef and shrimp stir fry dishes. It was overpriced and took almost an hour to arrive. Finally we received our food, and it was absolutely disgusting. The sauce had no flavor whatsoever and was completely tasteless. The beef was slimy and full of fat and the shrimp tasted old. We stopped eating and tossed it in the trash in hopes to avoid food poisoning. I\u2019ve had gross Chinese food before, but this place I can confidently say has the most disgusting Chinese food I have ever had the misfortune of eating.",

The meat was very fatty and  I basically wasted 40$ worth of food. We got 2 half sized sesame chicken and orange chicken.. the soda I ordered didn't even taste right? The crab rangoons were good though! I should have looked at the other her reviews on here",

I CALLED BACK & SPOKE WITH YASSIN. HE WAS VERY POLITE & TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD GIVE ME CREDIT FOR TOMORROW. I CALLED TODAY AT 11:45 AM & SPOKE WITH THE MOST NASTIEST RUDE GUY ON THE PLANET. HE TOLD ME THAT HE WASN'T GIVING ME ANYTHING FOR FREE BECAUSE I DIDN'T PAY FOR THE CHICKEN FRIED RICE.  I TOLD HIM THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO PAY BECAUSE THE DRIVER WALKED AWAY & THAT I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PAY FOR IT TODAY WITH RECEIVING A DISCOUNT FOR THE OTHER ITEMS THAT I DIDN'T RECEIVE. HE SAID NO HE WASN'T DOING THAT. HE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE & VERY OBNOXIOUS. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT HAPPENED & HE KEPT CUTTING ME OFF.

I ordered twice cooked pork and it was by far the worst twice cooked pork I have ever had.  Actually the only thing in it that is in traditional twice cooked pork was the pork.  But even that was stretching it, as they used a completely wrong cut of pork.  Every other ingredient in the dish is not an ingredient that is supposed to be in twice cooked pork.  Needless to say, it was missing all the crucial ingredients.  It tasted nothing like twice cooked pork.  And when I say nothing, I mean nothing as in the way steak tastes nothing like cream of broccoli soup.  Even if I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were making a different dish, I honestly don't know what that dish would be.  A moo goo gai pan ripoff with pork instead of chicken?  And preserved bamboo instead of fresh vegetables?  Possibly.  Except that dish doesn't exist in Chinese cooking.  Whatever it was they thought they were making, I can vividly describe what it tasted like:  decayed meat covered by a weak white wine based (as in mostly starch instead of wine) sauce.",
