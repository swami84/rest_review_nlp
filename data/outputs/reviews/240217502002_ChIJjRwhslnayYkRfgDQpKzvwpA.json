We had: Braised octopus and Vichyssoise as a starter, Sea Scallops and the lamb as our entree, and creme-br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. Well, starting with the Octopus: perfectly soft, tender and juicy, seasoned to its perfection; Vichyssoise: creamy, DELICIOUS and arrived at the perfect eating temperature! Each entree came with a little salad (you can choose between house and Caesar salad). The lamb was so tender and delicious! The Sea Scallops were almost like butter, amazing texture and seasoned perfectly! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was perfectly sweet with no egg smell or taste! Jason, our server, suggested a great wine to go with the scallops and was very friendly. Overall, an excellent dining experience!!!",

Here's my experience:  After telling the waiter about my allergy and then repeating when I placed my orders, the appetizer came out contaminated. The salad he was unsure of and had to verify, and though the allergen was not present, it was still concerning that he had to check after bringing it out to me. We had discussed how to modify the entre to accommodate my allergy, but the normal meal was brought out and I then waited more then 5 minutes for the waiter to return.  Meanwhile, my husband's dinner got cold and they did not take his back to keep warm as we asked. We had asked to have wine served with our meal and had to remind the waiter the second time my meal was brought out that we had asked for the wine. Up to this point the manager had been walking around to other tables and we thought he was unaware of our situation, but when he made it to our table he made a comment about my meal now being correct and moved on. At no point was an apology made by the manager and no discount was offered on our final bill. We were traveling from Boston to visit for my birthday and had been looking forward to trying this restaurant. Although the food was delicious, we were very disappointed by this experience.",

The portion sizes were much larger than we expected. My favorite item had to be the cauliflower soup. I was a little surprised at how basic it looked when it arrived at the table.

It is very expensive and I would say maybe a touch too expensive for what they offer but it wasn't the food that wasn't up to snuff. It was some of the service. Our waiter Tre was cool and very well groomed for that type of restaurant, however some of the busing staff need to be a little better versed at when people are done or not. They either cleared plates too early or way too late. I expect top quality for prices like that and it was lacking just a little. Overall it was great. Had a good time with fam. Would go again.

Ambience could be a bit better, the oddly shaped dining space lends itself to a more intense noise level at the back end, but the corner location with large windows is very nice. Also wish there were more USA wine options under $80/bottle (as it is, feels like a special occasion restaurant rather than a 'visit often' place) but it IS the tasting room so I'm sure the priority is quality over budget. Definitely go for the food, and hopefully you find a wine in your budget. I didn't look at them but there are options from outside the USA.",

The staff is not the friendliest and the place is crazy loud. So loud sometimes you can\u2019t have a conversation. That is due to the bad acoustics and drunk people at the bar which is part of the dining area. It is also small and cramped. When you enter you always feel like you are bothering them to ask for a table. Forget getting a friendly welcome or thanks for dining with us. This is typical in Frederick. The staff is very cold and aloof from the management on down. It only gets worse. Won\u2019t be going back.",

        "caption": "Good service from Kendall and food from the chef, a real gem, worth the one hour drive! We started with two decadent choices, the lobster chowder and the fois grad. Excuse me while I get on my soap-box, what sets food apart in my opinion is technique and ingredients, the tasting room technique is simple and straight forward, but also precise. And the ingredients are so fresh and flavorful, they would only be better if they grew them ina tasting room farm. The fois gras was cooked perfectly, rare enough with a slight crisp on the surface, the super thin jam crostini was not an after thought but a perfect texture addition to the fatty duck; the chowder was creamy but not oily and the tender pieces of lobster and potato and onion and corn swam in the tastiest creamiest sauce. Mmm! The superiority of the ingredients was really showcased in the fois gras l, the honey, the fruits and the herbs were so fresh and full of flavor. For entree we had the fillet mignon and the crab dip. We upgraded the potato gratin to lobster creamed potatoes and were not disappointed. For dessert both the carrot cake and the crepe br\u00fbl\u00e9e were on point. The only thing we were not happy with was the cauliflower stew but that was more of a palate than anything and they did not charge us for it. The tea selection from Mighty Leaf organic was the perfect ending to a lovely meal that was both refreshing and decadent.",

We had a reservation, we arrived on time, and the table was ready for us. Our waiter seemed a little Irritated to be serving us from the onset. When the entrees arrived my fianc\u00e9 was in the restroom and our waiter sat down a plate of scallops in front of her seat. My fianc\u00e9 does not enjoy any type of seafood so I said  that I think he had placed them in the wrong spot, someone else must have ordered scallops. He definitely heard me but chose to ignore me. I told him again that he misplaced the scallops and he cut me off mid sentence and forcefully told me she ordered the scallops. Then insued a childish, back and forth argument about whether she did or didn\u2019t order scallops and I told him that she would never order seafood because she does not enjoy the taste.  The waiter told me I was wrong and he would have to check with my fianc\u00e9 when she got back from the restrooms.  So she comes back a minute later and the waiter rudely shoves a menu in her face and asks her what she ordered. Keep in mind she has no idea we\u2019ve just been arguing about scallops (yes, it was as ridiculous as it sounds)  so she is taken aback by his aggressiveness. Of course, she tells him she didn\u2019t order scallops and they end up bringing out her actual order. He does not apologize, he just looks further annoyed. Not cool when he\u2019s the one who took down the wrong order.  To be fair he may have been having a bad day, I hope that is not his typical attitude. Plus, the scallops did look pretty good.  All in all, the food was good and the server was the rudest I\u2019ve ever had. For a fraction of the price you could be treated better at Waffle House.",

The fillet was perfectly cooked and seasoned...one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. And last but not least, the sorbet for dessert is sinfully good. The waiter was also super attentive and very friendly. The food was worth every dollar for the quality of food and experience. The $45 fillet here is better than others from restaurants of comparable cost and higher IMO.",

My whole experience, start to finish, was fantastic. I came here really for one reason, to try a good steak. My local friends said this was the place to go and to try the Fillet Mignon: rare to medium rare.  I did just that. My wife and I both ordered the mignon. It was perfect: best steak I\u2019ve had in Frederick by far. This was a lot better than other nearby restaurants that served expensive steak.  The place is pricey. We spent about $200 for two of us - without appetizers. So this is a once in awhile date for us.  I would like to see a better selection of craft beer. That was the only thing that made the place not so great. Also it is fairly small. I hope they can expand and make it more open.",
