Customer service is friendly and fast.  Cons: -The menu stated \u201cfree refills $3\u201d but they still charged us for refills because they can\u2019t refill our cups cause of covid and have to replace it with a fresh cup. I understand and respect the safety protocols but the menu should have said that. My friend and I ordered a drink because of the free refills. The table next to me also asked why they got charged as well. -We got charged the auto 18% gratuity for more than 6 people at our table when there was only 3 of us. We did have a party of 6 but because of covid regulations we had to be split to 2 separated tables of 3. Again, I understand the protocols but we didn\u2019t even sit next to each other. -We had a parking validation issue when they only stamped our parking ticket once. We had to go back into the restaurant to get it validated again.",

You will probably prefer this place if you do not have preconceptions of what your meal should be. The seasoning is just about right - but something feels a little off. Not bad, just... not what you might remember.  Parking is the usual mess for that area. There is a lot nearby, but there are fewer spaces than there are seats in the surrounding restaurants. I parked down the street at the DonQ, but you could try the WallMart or Ross lots if you plan on shopping there later. Once you arrive, it is noisy inside. You may have to shout to be heard, but there is a festive atmosphere. It can be crowded, with elbows and knees rubbing. This is a place to bring friends and celebrate.  With the aforementioned caveats about the food... Southern sweet-tea it ain't. The fried baskets were pretty good, but there were no po'boy sandwiches on the menu, which is confounding to this po'boy. All they need to add is a hoagie roll toasted with garlic butter! Their boiled seafood was somewhat unexpected. These are not Gulf Coast spiny or slipper lobsters, nor are they green or blue crabs. They have substituted Pacific options, which is okay. I found it amusing that they provided gloves to everyone, but no crab-mallets or crab-crackers to crush limbs of the arthropod of your choosing. You can cut open your sea-legs with a pair of sturdy scissors. It works, but again, it isn't what I grew up with. Not bad - just different. Good to eat communally - break some stuff apart with friends.  Flavorwise, I ordered \"spicy\" hot, but found it muted. The flavor was interesting, and just about right for Cajun. Good garlic, but it didn't soak into my crawdads very thoroughly. You're not eating the crunchy bits outside with the flavoring, so I recommend dunking your meat back into the soup in the boil-bag for a soak while you continue peeling your crustaceans.  Not quite Louisiana, but this place seemed very popular with Japanese tourists.",

It was actually a seafood restaurant that eats wild. It is like a chain store that originated in the continental United States.  I looked into the store around 16:00 and there was only one pair. I wonder if you can choose the menu carefully! I decided to enter the store. The menu was only in English, but the store's older brother was very friendly, and it was easy to get along with us who couldn't decide the order.  After all, I ordered a combo with my elder brother's recommendation. It was about $ 68 for two people. Order popcorn shrimp and french fries set and ice tea It was $ 100 including total chips.  The taste is garlic's butter soy sauce that works well, so I think it is a favorite seasoning for any Japanese! We can choose the spiciness but we choose normal Still it was a bit tangible. Shrimp, shrimp, mussels, clams, potatoes, corn and sausages are served in a plastic bag. Do n\u2019t try to eat It \u2019s so hot that my hands are almost burned.  It was really delicious with no strange smell!

We go early since it's a kinda small place and there is always a line out the door on weekends. Staff is super attentive and on the move...they hustle. Our table ordered by families...so we ordered 3 different items and some fries to share. My wife and I (and daughter and boyfriend) ordered from the \"by the pound\" menu...shrimp (my daughter opted for the Kauai prawns) and snow crab...plus an order of potatoes, corn, and rice...in their house sauce...mild. Everything was perfectly done. The only thing I wish they would do is devein the shrimp. They could use more sauce too...seems to be less than before. My other daughter and family had a \"combo\"...which came with clams,  mussels, potatoes, corn, susage, and rice...and they chose snow crab as their main...in hot sause. They also ordered extra sausage on the side. Food always comes out fast...10 mins tops...and it's very hot (temp)...in a double plastic bag. We dawned our bib and gloves and dug in...shrimp and snow crab shells were flying everywhere...a totally fun dining experience! The actual seafood ingredients are average to good quality...but it's their sauces that make this place special...and they have about 5 or 6 to choose from...mild to super spicy.  We all usually select the shrimp, Kauai prawns, and snow crab...but they also have king crab, Dungeness crab, crawfish and a few other choices.  We're not drinkers...but they do serve beer...soft drinks  are refillable. There is also another section on the menu with items like fried catfish and other items I can't remember since we never order those. Prices are reasonable...$40 to $60 for 2 and goes up from there depending on your selections..can easily reach $100+ if you keep adding mains, sides, and drinks...or go with the higher end combos. All in all...a great place for an eat with your hands and fun meal...and tasty too.  We love this place.and will keep going back!!!",

This is the level of fraud ...  I got a $ 4 cheaper platter and I got a tip of 18% and 20% each, so I gave it $ 300. I wanted to be a little expensive, but then I did not notice that the service charge was duplicated and added an extra tip. It was a mistake ...  There is a basic service charge per person and it is not listed.  It's amazing how Korean people are packed in this way.

Everything is fine, but the crab inside is not good. If you eat a crab combo with two people, you get a lot of batter I ate the shrimp for an additional $3. Free drink refill is available.
