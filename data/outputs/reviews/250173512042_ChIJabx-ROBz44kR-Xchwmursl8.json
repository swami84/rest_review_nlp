Today we tried: Mocha, Vanilla, Cake Batter, Red Velvet, Fruity Pebble, Vanilla Rose.  All great.  We ordered online, ahead of time and were able to pickup same day, in under an hour, with an easy pick up.  We enjoy trying Macarons from all over Greater Boston when we get the chance.  Yes, they are a bit pricey and thus an occasional treat, but we make sure to fully enjoy them when we do get em.  SO worth it! I noticed today, they will deliver, so this would be a perfect bday gift package.  Also saw, a 3-6-9 or 12 monthly subscription-how cool is that?!",

We wanted to support a local business and are so glad we found Maca; Tamy was so great to work with! Not only were the macarons delicious but they were beautiful. Tamy was able to customize the treats (both flavor and design), even including some edible gold leaf to add some extra glamour.  Maca not only bakes these wonderful macas but boxed them up for us as well. When I accidentally didn\u2019t provide Tamy with enough twine to complete the macaron packaging, she went above and beyond and purchased some more on her own knowing it was a crazy time for me. Our guests can still not stop commenting about how great the macarons were. We would highly recommend Maca to anyone! Run, don\u2019t walk, to Bow Market to try some!",

Small batch style and I believe flavors are always rotating which is a big plus for me! Some were a little too soft as opposed to being chewy but I would take that over a slightly over baked one any day. The only downside is I don\u2019t live near there so I can\u2019t go there every day!  I do have a couple negatives but these do not affect the rating (They are more suggestions  ) 1. Just make the macs an even $3 (maybe 28 on a dozen) 2. If the flavors are always changing/rotating I would recommend a daily post with a list of the flavors you can acquire on that particular day. This way if you have flavors one would want on that day they may be willing to travel if they know that flavor is available that day.",

Some macarons are brittle and hollow but these are always perfectly moist and soft and have a lot of filling, whereas other companies try to skimp on the filling.
