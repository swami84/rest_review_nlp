I had it with guacamole and every bite was pleasing. I did put a dollop of the salsa verde and it did what I hoped it would do, make the variety of flavors blend and it did just that.  The esquite we ordered was also great. Fresh tortilla chips to go with and the squeeze of lime over it was marvelous. I highly recommend you give these guys a try.
