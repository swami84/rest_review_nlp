The portion sizes are great and nothing was too anything (oily.salty, sugary, etc). If you're looking for a new, flavorful chinese spot to try- you got to try this place. Also, they gave us some free cakes and we were actually celebrating my birthday so that was really sweet.",

        "caption": "I had to read through the reviews again to make sure I\u2019d been to the same restaurant that people were complementing...this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I\u2019ve ever had. The restaurant only had a few tables occupied when my party came in, no one greeted us, there wasn\u2019t anyone on the floor or counter, it was ten minutes later that someone appeared with menus. We each ordered separately and our food arrived one by one, all at different times. The scallion pancakes were the last to arrive, burnt and inedible with the exception of two pieces where it was possible to eat around the burned edges. The braised eggplants was bland and stodgy, the sauce vaguely grainy. The dan dan noddles were tasty, if sweet. No one checked in with us to see how the food was. I had to get up to ask for water, because our waters hadn\u2019t be refilled since we sat down. Instead of coming by the table to check if we needed anything, such as refill the rest of the waters on the table, the waiter disappeared. We asked for the check twice, the restaurant was empty except for us by now (it was only 10), and yet it took the waiter another 10 minutes to finally bring it to the table. The prices on our check didn\u2019t match those advertised on the menu. When I confronted the waiter about it he gave me all sorts of excuses, including: 1) the price on the computer is the right price, 2) these are old menus, 3) we ordered something different, 4) the price on the menu is for a starter side not an entree, 5) he would have to call a manager and ask, it would be difficult, he insinuated. I was perplexed by now. He came back to our table only seconds later with the prices changed, it had apparently been no trouble at all, making his list of excuses that much more confusing.  Having worked in restaurant before, I just wanted to leave and never come back. There was so much wrong with this place, so much they could do to make it better.  Other issues: there\u2019s no music or ambiance; there\u2019s no chilly oil or other condiments on the table to season the incredibly bland food; this place is definitely violating health codes, at a nearby table unsealed food was marinating in a metal tray.",

The second time I went here I asked the waitress what she recommended. \ud83d\udc4dShe was very honest and helpful and recommended the orange chicken. I ordered that and pork buns--I've had the general tsos before so I knew what to expect. The quality of the meat is extremely poor. Never in my life have I encountered meat like it. It is dry and just a bizarre texture but each time I just go with it. The sauces are so sticky! You can almost pick it off the meat. The pork buns were gross. I've eaten pork buns on campus and they were amazing (shredded pork inside). The pork here was a weird, bland grey-brown lump. The outside of the buns were fine but inside it was a soggy mess. I took leftovers home of the chicken and ate it a few hours later. The chicken tasted sandy (?? So bizarre), it was like the meat changed entirely between me packaging it up at the restaurant and reheating it for two minutes in the microwave in my dorm. The texture stopped me from eating the rest. I was very disappointed.\ud83d\udc4e If I could give one recommendation to the owners: you have an outstanding team in the kitchen--they work so fast--but I would appreciate fresh chicken or in the very least something different than what you have now. I like the idea of supporting a small local Chinese restaurant (hence my two visits) but even the dish the staff recommended did not satisfy me.",

What I got was cold, mushy, pork that was fried but I don't think it was the right dish as there wasn't one piece of pineapple in it. I did not get thai shrimp fried rice with my order, but plain white rice NOT what I ordered. They did not put any napkins, plastic ware, or anything extra into the bag that usually comes with Chinese delivery. This was NOT worth my money at all and I won't order from here again. I ordered online so there should not have been any miscommunications with what I ordered. So I don't know why they didn't give me that.",
