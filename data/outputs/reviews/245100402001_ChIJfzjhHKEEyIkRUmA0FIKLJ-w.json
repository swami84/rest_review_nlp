When we returned to get it was asked \u201care u sure u didn\u2019t get it\u201d why the heck would I be asking if I did. That irritated me to no end.

We had a nice conversation with Ms. Connie herself while we waited.  My daughter is looking forward to returning.",

Connie is doing something special here.  If you are concerned about the location, use UberEATS or their website to place a delivery order.  If you visit in person, there is a wait and you might have to wait behind some of those UberEATS orders.  Because this place is growing in popularity.  Connie needs to open up a full up restaurant.",

Y'all should have 3 tenders with that or if they not a nice size add another one. I love to eat and support anyone. I don't think I'll go back unless they add more tenders an not burn them.
