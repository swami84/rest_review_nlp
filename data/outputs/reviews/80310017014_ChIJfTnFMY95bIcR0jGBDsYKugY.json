And when I asked if I could just cancel the order, the woman sounded greatful and thanked me for canceling.  All because I wanted to add broccoli to my fried rice.  6:20pm Monday October 5th, 2015 Very bad business practice.",

All the battered and fried protein isn't over cooked. It's actually juicy meat not just fried batter. The Crab Ragoons and Fried Dumplings are to die for. SO So glad I found this place.
