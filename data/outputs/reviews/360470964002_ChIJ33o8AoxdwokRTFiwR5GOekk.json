I was a little disappointed they did not have the Fried Crab Po-boy which was advertised on the menu, it's actually sauteed crab meat. Instead I got the Shrimp Po Boy & Fries ; Great flavor (sandwich have five jumbo shrimps). Could have used more salad and a sauce to make it a real po-boy sandwich. I Love the fact that you can pick between Cajun, Sweet potato or regular fries. I also got the fried calamari (big pieces not those skinny rings you get at most places) Crispy batter & Seasoned well ,but a little bit salty for my taste but overall the food was Good. It is a NEW seafood place for the area and I will definitely go back again to try more items.",
