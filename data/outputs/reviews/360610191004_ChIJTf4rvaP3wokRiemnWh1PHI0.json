Also the people preparing the food in the kitchen are no longer Japanese.",

It\u2019s never crowded, consistently delicious, and has so many things on the menu that I don\u2019t even know where to start.  We come here almost every week.  We\u2019ve never had a bad dish - and this place reminds me of being back in Japan.  I almost don\u2019t want to leave this review because it\u2019s our favorite little spot and we don\u2019t want it to get more crowded but that would be a disservice to this place, especially in Covid times.",

They treat you like a mix of royalty and family.  Their menu accommodates those seeking comfort food, old favorites, and new taste adventures alike. They have a large regular menu and changing specials menu. You'll find dishes that you've never had before and the ones that you have had elsewhere are better executed as well as carefully & beautifully presented here.  All of their house specialties are amazing. My favorite is the eel prepared by the chef and owner. The best eel I've ever had.  They also have a well curated sake & shochu list.",
