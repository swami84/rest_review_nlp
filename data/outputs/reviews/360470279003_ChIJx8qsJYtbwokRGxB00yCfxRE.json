We said ok no southern food from there again but maybe something else would be good... I ordered a 3 piece and fries one night in exhaustion to feed my kid quickly. I said I wanted a breast leg and wing.he gave me the boney breast part with tht lil piece of meat pressed into the spine, a small charred wing and a wing tht was huge so he broke the drum part n called it a leg\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f .the co owner who was there that day looked at him and then at me but I kept quiet tht day.at this point most of the neighborhood wouldn\u2019t eat here due to him and his food. Yet here i was a 3 rd time months later...they were trying to get money coming in with a five dollar menu. I got something in a moment of hope and laziness after a double shift. It was dried out little chicken wings and stale fries, when I brought it back the waitress (or w.e) asked me what do u expect for five dollars! I expect for u guys to take pride in your livelyhood. To drive it all home the co owner has left the restaurant to the rude one to run there was a big scene n all. Most are waiting for this guy to be replaced by something that effects the community with positive and quality service. Last thing to consider... do u want to eat from a place that someone is living out of that doesn\u2019t have an equipped bathroom?cus dude lives there now, which almost made me not write this but they didn\u2019t care bout anything but getting my money so y should I?",

We waited a long time to get the food which may or may not have to do with the actual restaurant. To begin, we ordered curry goat and got stewed goat. We waited long enough for the food so we just proceeded to eat it. Now, I am not an avid goat meat eater. It has been years since I have eaten goat so, I don't really know what the fat from the goat looks like. Thanks to this restaurant, I am fully aware of what it looks like because that is what I was served. A platter of rice and peas and goat fat. As I am eating putting the fat to the side and noticed that ALL of what was suppose to be goat meat was fat. ALL OF IT! There was a sprinkle of goat meat here and ther but ultimately, all fat. I was very upset. I called the restaurant and informed the owner. He said to bring it in. So I did. He proceeded to tell me that because I ate the food, he wasn't going to do anything about the fact that he gave me all fat. We had a huge argument in his store. I came to the conclusion he was not going to anything to make this right. Not only did I come to a conclusion, he said it out of his mouth. I wasn't expecting a full refund. I was expecting atleast some kind of courtesy due to the fact that he served me all fat to eat. I informed him of my expectations and he told me he is not doing anything about it. The food that I did eat which was the rice and peas and buffalo was merely edible. Nothing spectacular about it. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this store. Unless you enjoy eating pure fat and mediocre food. When I told the owner about the review I would leave, he pulled the race card. Talking about, I don't do that to the chinese when I order from them. So now, it's because he's black. Not because I ordered curry goat and got stewed goat fat. I hope this poor review actually helps this guy because without happy customers, you have no business. If you make a mistake, you should correct it. Not argue with customers.  April 27th 2017  In response to the owners lies, I guess you didn't check the Yelp review that I posted with pictures of the the fat that you served me. Try again.",
