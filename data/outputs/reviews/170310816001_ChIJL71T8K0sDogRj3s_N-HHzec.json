Think they're trying to mix it up a bit with different focus but the food isn't quite as tasty, nor the menu that appealing.  House burger was pretty good along with chocolate/coffee dessert. Gnudi not so good. Burrata and ham toast yummy and generous portion. I do miss the cheese curds.",

Sable is far more than your average hotel bar (Hotel Palomar) - it stands mightily on its own.  Well worth a visit - I try to come by every time I'm back in Chicago.",

I sat down at the bar and talked to the bartender briefly about their drink list. I had absolutely no idea how extensive the list was. There is an entire page for gin & tonics. They have classic cocktails with a twist, and their \"unforgettable\" cocktails. The bartender had only been working there for a few months but he had the entire list memorized. After my friend got there, she told me it was on of the best cocktail bars in the city and she had always wanted to go. The waitress was so funny and quirky. She also had so many recommendations and was very knowledgeable on the drinks. When she was busy at other tables, what I can assume was the manager would swing by our table and ask how our drinks were. He was suggest other drinks based on our taste preferences, and assured us if we hated it he would send it back and try something new. It was such a nice surprise for being in downtown Chicago. I would go back again in a heartbeat.",

In the back they have a beautiful dining area. I called ahead for a party of 6 so they seated us in a very nice room in back.  Overall food was extremely overrated in my opinion. I did enjoy the cheese curds which came with a spicy ketchup and offered a very unique flavor but lets face it you don't go to a place like this looking for cheese curds.  Unfortunately the Venison and the Octopus were both taken off the menu which was a bit disappointing.  The scallops were a bit too salty but fairly large. The drink menu offers a plentiful variety of drinks... I chose to try the bourbon flight and will admit it was OUTSTANDING and one of the few reasons I still gave this place a 3 star.  The restaurant manager was a nice guy and did send us some champagne and a free desert on the house as well as an order of Turkey Poutine (the Turkey Poutine was a bit awkward as most of our diners were vegetarian and I told him that upfront). The toffee cake is very delicious and worth trying!  Overall I recommend coming here for the drinks and not the food! Not a bad option for a drink after work or a weekend evening but far from what we expected!",

Everything on the menu sounded amazing but at a half win loose ratio I'm rounding down.  I thought we could just walk in 20min before our 9:45am reservation with no problem, but apparently people make reservations at 8am!? They did apologize for the wait and offered us coffee, even though we were early, 1 point Sable.  We were right next to the kitchen so its hard to not have good service but our waiter was very helpful and peppy.  I got a caffeine buzz just from a cup of coffee being poured next to me. The fresh squeezed orange juice is good but the portion size is huge, like 500 calories (estimate) huge, but clearly I couldn't waste any!  As instructed we shared all dishes family style, half portion between 4:  Pull Apart Butterscotch Monkey Bread 7, couldn't hold a flame to my grandmothers. Too much bread, not enough butterscotch goodness.  House Cured Salmon Gravlox: pickled red onions, pumpernickel 10, loved by my Swedish grandmother, and everyone else. The thick dill shmear really made this dish for me as I'm not a salmon fan.  Maine Lobster Frittata: potatoes, chives, corn, oven dried tomatoes 11, was good but too many potatoes. Here's a hint $11 for a hockey puck sized frittata shouldn't have any fillers, like potatoes. Lacked that sparkle for me, but enjoyed by my less judgey family.  Espresso-Cocoa Nib Steak & Eggs: farm eggs, steak, hash browns 15, was definitely a winner. The steak was super tender and flavorful and a very good sized portion.  Three Sister's Grits with White Cheddar 4 were delicious and comforting and the same size porting as all of the entrees! Definitely recommend adding a side of these!  We ate light and didn't have booze, our check was around $72 for 4. I would be up for trying dinner but I won't be back for brunch, too many other places to try!",

I asked her to have my hash browns crispy and she said, \"That is how we make them!\" I was like perfect, maybe my birthday is turning around right now. My wife ordered a egg white veggie scramble that came with fresh fruit. She asked if I would split the order of Applewood Bacon with her. Honestly does she need to ask me? We're talking Bacon here! Adding Bacon to anything is a simple YES! Now the more I thought about this I thought sharing or splitting Bacon just isn't right but I decided to honor my side of the agreement. Trust me I was thinking about how to get all the bacon though. Don't judge me because it is my birthday!  The Eggs Benedict were good. There were simple and traditional but that is what I wanted. I did not want a crazy chef inspired version of Eggs Benedict. This totally hit the spot on my birthday. Now the star of the show was the Hash Browns. These things were amazing and one of the best Hash Browns I have ever had in the city. There are other restaurants in the City that only make Hash Browns and they make the worse Hash Browns I have ever had. I won't name them but I think you can figure out who they are. They only really make Hash Browns. I think the Sable should change there name to: We make VERY DELICIOUS Hash Browns! I would go to a place named that.  In fact, the Hash Brown were so good I even had to Tweet about them. I was even lucky enough to receive a response from the Chef Heather Terhune. I thought that was really sweet of her. In fact, she has promised to email me the recipe for my birthday. How nice is that? We spoke a few times and she had to cut down the recipe for me from 50 servings to 3 servings. Thanks so much Chef! This is turning out to be a great birthday so far.  My wife loved here breakfast. It was perfect for her. It had everything she loves for breakfast: egg whites, veggies and fresh fruit. She gave me a taste and it was really good. She was a little let down with the bacon. When she hears Applewood Bacon she is expecting a thick cut of bacon and this was not very thick cut. So I can see her complaint. For me it is hard to say no to any piece of bacon and I had no problem cleaning up the bacon.  This was a great place for breakfast.  Also a shout out to Chef Heather Terhune and thanks for the recipe. I need more Hash Browns...you have me hooked and thanks for making my day special. I truly appreciate it.",

The food was delicious and well portioned.  We shared the Poutine, Short Rib Sliders, Bacon Jam and Chicken and waffles.  Our server, Rachel was fantastic in helping my wife pick out a wine and she made great recommendations on the food.  She was very informative, extremely generous and decidedly very laid back.  She did not make us feel rushed in choosing and made us feel as though we were her only table.  Overall, this was one of the best experiences for us, dining in Chicago.  A true gem!",

Wether you get it smothered on cheddar scallion scones at brunch or on the crisp, buttery baguette at dinner, you can't go wrong.  My all time favorites besides the bacon jam are the corn creme brule, veal meatballs and the fried green tomatoes. Every time I go back, I fall in love with a new dish.

I love coming here for afterwork drinks and bar bites - they have everything from homemade beef jerky, Wisconsin cheese curds, and lots of great bacony dishes!

They have booths and open tables so it's great for a friends night out or a date night. Some of my favorites here are the short rib sliders, deviled eggs, and the sweet corn creme brulee. Not to mention that Heather was also a pastry chef for a long time so she kills it with the desserts, they are all so good it's hard to pick a favorite. Behind the bar leading the crew is Mike Ryan ( a former Moto employee) his flavor profile and ability to construct drinks is almost unmatched in the city. He has a great personality and a awesome haircut. The staff is all very personable and you get treat very nicely. If I am able to sneak out early one night from work, this would be on my list of places to stop at before I make it home.",
