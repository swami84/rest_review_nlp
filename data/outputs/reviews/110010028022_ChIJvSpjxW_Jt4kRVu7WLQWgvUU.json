His food recommendations were very tasty as well so I\u2019m glad I asked questions. He was willing to answer all of them and never got annoyed. For the appetizers we tried the samosas and Keema Pav which were very flavorful! We also had garlic naan. For the entrees we decided on the butter chicken which came with complimentary rice as well as the Lamb Rohan Dosh. Our meals were very flavorful and the right amount of spice! My friend and I are African so we like our food well seasoned so Bombay was absolutely delicious. The place was clean and the food was served hot! The tables are well spaced out so they are definitely conscious of COVID standards and also do contact tracing. We will definitely be back. The service that our server (Noor) gave was outstanding!",

Only good thing is it\u2019s included with 2 pieces of tandoori chicken which is good. The area restaurant surrounded by is completely shady with lot of beggars and street vendors. I you try some authentic food better not go here. It\u2019s Americanized completely that\u2019s why you see good reviews. My wife from Nagpur didn\u2019t like any of there food. Note: In worst case if you go there beware of the arrogant gatekeeper and don\u2019t ask any information about menu he\u2019s so blunt .",

This place has the best taste out of all of them. Their Butter Chicken is spice well and extremely creamy. Their appetizers are all delicious but on the spicier side. The portions are all big, an entree will fill you up and the appetizers are of a portion to be shared. Mango Lassi was also delicious too.  Price: At around ~$14 per entree, this is on par with most places in DC. But the portions are bigger so well worth the value.  Reservations: Yelp says they take reservation, but in my experience they actually don't. Be prepared to wait a bit during the weekends as it's always packed. I get mainly take out for this reason. But well worth the wait.  Experience: Extremely friendly staff that is prompt with their service without compromising friendliness. The restaurant is clean and the table space is about average for a DC restaurant. I honestly wish they had more room to serve more people.",

It did not even taste like pav bhaji. It tasted more like sambar. The masalas were nasty in pav bhaji and again it didnt taste even close to pav bhaji..the gobi manchurian was ok and too dry..I would never go back again.",

Being an Indian, I am usually skeptical about the taste of Indian food abroad but this restaurant takes me back home. I am really fond of their vada pav and Palak chat and they are great appetizers. I recently tried their keema pav and it didn\u2019t disappoint me at all. Their biryani (both chicken and lamb) are specially cooked giving an authentic taste. I usually drink the chai or mango lassi depending on my mood and they certainly quench my thirst for a good old Indian beverage.  The service is very quick and the staff is very kind and cordial. Plus it is reasonably priced and super affordable even for students. Overall, highly recommend it. I bet, once you eat here, you will go back to try some more.",

The place looked promising, and music was nice as we entered, the service was excellent, but food was way below expectations.  The vada pav was too oily, and didn't have much taste. I was like, that's fine, let's try chilly chicken. Well, that was biggest disappointment. The chicken was so hard that one could not use fork, also the taste was not as I imagined. Anyway, I requested if the kitchen could make it again, but then it seems fried chicken was supposed to this hard - the kitchen said. Chicken roll was replacement, which was average too.  The chai was good.",

You get 6 different types of dishes with rice, nana, biryani and gulab jamoon. It\u2019s a complete meal for two and you get to taste 3 vegetarian and 3 meat dishes. Dahi poori was very good and the biryani was so tender and hot. It\u2019s a must try if you go on the area and make sure you have some time as getting a table here is difficult.",

Now mostly all was ok , I had better North Indian sabji and bread - naan. But it was not bad . Good or different was Malai kofta, mango laasi, palak chaat.

It's hits the sweet spot of atmosphere - large tables with large portions in metal containers coming to you to share with whoever you're eating with. Everything down to the glassware used to serve chai, the serving dishes for parata and naan, and the food itself reminded me of the Indian street food scene. Not so fancy that you have to dress up, and not so cheap that the curry is water. We had samosas to start (2 in 1 order), chicken Tikka masala, chana masala, and alo Gobi parata and garlic naan. Absolutely loved this place - will definitely be coming here again with a much emptier stomach.  Pro-tip: This place gets busy, although Google will tell you there's no wait, get there a little early and put your name down on the list. They told me they'd seat me in 30 min and it ended up being 10.",

This place was an onslaught to the senses. Packed to the brim, if that was Bollywood music now I understand why all the crazed wide eyed Chershire cat smiles, interior decor street slick vibes to PC collage blowup wall... thing, and vibrant colors everywhere. It takes a special personal kind of aesthetic vision to concoct what we experienced. It borders between kitschy and chaotic. At one point I felt like Bruce from Bruce Almighty where the music/people get so loud where you can\u2019t hear yourself think. I\u2019ve read SO MUCH that service was great... hm, off night I guess. I felt like we were invisible, at the bar. They poured water into the glasses of people that were before us, for us! It took the mgr 3X to get the bartender to get to us, and when he finally did he moved slower than molasses. It wasn\u2019t until someone else commented on it when I realized that it wasn\u2019t me and that the guy was in a trance. We watched him screw a cap unto a bottle for a full 2 min before he realized it was already closed. He just kept turning and turning the cap, like how this review keeps going and going... all in all, I think we\u2019ll go back and try some other dishes. Why not? We\u2019re gluttons for punishment.",

If you like substandard food this is your go to place. We ordered vadapav which was mediocre, Gobi Manchurian which had more ketchup than cauliflower, for appetizers. We decided to try the Veg Kohlapuri for main course. The sauce for this curry tasted of uncooked garam masala and the vegetables in it had not been cooked very long for them to get flavorful. The naan was dry and hard. When we mentioned this to one of the people ( I think it was the owner or manager of the restaurant) he said he will let us order one item instead of the veg Kohlapuri. By that time we were ready to head out so we ordered Paneer kathi roll to go, for which they charged us. Well, well, how nice of them, right? Wrong!!! They packed sheek kabab kathi roll instead and this vegetarian was furious to say the least. If you are truly looking for authenticity, this place misses the mark massively.",

I love the \"Monsoon season\" menu, which includes spicy Indian snack foods like fried paneer, which comes with a delicious chai. The staff is friendly and efficient, and the space is roomy and clean. I highly recommend this place!",

It seems like a small space, but once inside, you see its two rooms can sit many. There's booth seating, table seating, and a large bar.  The service is very good and genuinely friendly.  The food is excellent. They have a large menu, but where they win is their appetizers. I recommend the keema pav. It's a steel pot with minced chicken/lamb and ginger and garlic. It's like a stew and comes with grilled rolls of Hawaiian sweet bread. It easily is a full meal and perfectly seasoned!",

My friend and I ordered the bombay palak chat appetizer and the dinner for 2 bombay thali special. The palak was delicious. The crispy texture of the fried spinach and creamy yogurt chutney was perfect. We saved some to dip with with currys.  The thali special includes a bunch of samplers from the butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, saagwala and chick vindalo. It was a lot of food for 2 people and well worth it. My friend and I loved the butter chicken, saagwala and rogan josh. All of these meats were tender and seasoned very well. Beware, if you cannot handle the spices the darker the curry expect the spicier the dish. Overall this is a great place for some authentic Indian food. Prices are reasonable and service here is great. There is plenty of neighborhood street parking in the area.",

I went with my Yelp Elite buddy Skyler and we enjoyed a wonderful feast.  The Vada Pav (5/5) - Veggie sliders with a spicy potato patty sandwiched between fluffy buttery grilled bun that's soft on the outside and crispy on the inside was divine! We were seriously contemplating getting another round. This was my favorite dish on the menu!  Bombay Palak Chaat (4/5) - Crispy spinach with onions and tomatoes topped with raita (yogurt sauce) and a variety of savory and sweet chutney sauces was tasty. Traditionally, the chaat toppings don't sit on a bed of spinach and instead are on top of crunchy crackers \"papri chat\", or a samosa, or inside crunchy shells \"dahi puri\" (which is on the luckily on the menu!). Will opt for the Dahi Puri or Bhel Puri next time!  Dinner for 2 Thali (5/5) - Large sample platter with healthy mix of 3 vegetation and 3 meaty curries + tandoori butter chicken was perfect for sharing and the hefty $35 price tag was well worth it! Even comes with fluffy naan, basmati rice, and crunchy pauper. Of the vegetarian dishes, the savory lentil Daal Makni and spinach Saag Paneer with small chunky cottage cheese pieces were flavorful, while the chickpea-based Choola had a nice spicy kick! The indian curries were quite authentic, they weren't oily and I couldn't taste any cream. The little dishes are a generous portion as we delightfully split up the leftovers to take home.  Delicious affordable meal for $25. Looking forward to coming back for some Vada Pav and exploring other items on the menu!",

However, during busy times of the day, don't expect to find parking easily. Patrons in this neighborhood are relegated to parallel parking - if there's space available.  That's not the restaurant's responsibility though. Walking in, you'll see a bar and booths with decent lighting, talkative staff, and the wonderful smell of Bombay street food.  The hostess masterfully directs the hordes of customers, and proactively responds to questions.  The food then arrives at the table rapidly. The meat was tender, the sauces spiced with heat and fragrance, and the naan well seasoned with garlic. But, a couple sprinkles of salt may have done the naan justice, but otherwise it complimented the food well. Lastly, when the plates say anything about being spicy, BELIEVE it. It's important to note that the heat didn't mask the flavor of the food though.  Overall, I can see why this place is always packed. The ambiance is good for both dates or a casual hangout, the food was delicious, and the service was quick and helpful.",

I love the dal makhani, just order it with some garlic nan and you are sorted. The kababs here sizzle and come to you with that trail of smoke which makes everyone look at you. It tastes better than most of the kababs I have had in India. Finally for dessert I\u2019d suggest gajar ka halwa. Its not super sweet but neither bland. Cooked well. I personally am not a big fan of really sweet stuff, so this was just perfect for me. I m sure I ll be going there soon enough and keep updating here.",

Silverware and the dishes were very average, so was furniture.. there are many better places around without the buzz in DMV.  Maybe we came with high expectations..when you add Bombay to any name especially if the restaurant is cooking the Bombay street food you always expect the best or quality.
