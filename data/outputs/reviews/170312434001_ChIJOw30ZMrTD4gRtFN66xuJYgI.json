Instead it was dark thigh meat and my order actually had some fat cooked in as well.  On to the dahi bhalla, very bland bhalla and one of them was still frozen (enough that I couldn't even break it with a spoon)  while the other two were thawed enough.  Again for the price and quality being advertised, this should not be acceptable.  The yogurt was on the sweet side and it had pomegranate seeds in it too.

We really enjoyed all the curries we tried - especially the cashew tikka and matar paneer. The dahl was also a really delicious side dish. The value was also great and we'll get another meal out of leftovers. My husband enjoyed his gin cocktail, which was nicely balanced. The service was great and everyone was really friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back!",

Goat Sikh Kabab was flavorful although a real char was missing on the meat which is hard to do on typical restaurant grill as opposed to a charcoal unit. Baby corn and pea curry was flavorful but more watery than I expected. English peas were mentioned on the menu but  they tasted more like frozen peas - not canned. The Tandoori Chicken was advertised as being flavored with several ingredients but the result was not intense by any means and there were grill marks on the breast which I didn't expect from a Tandoor. Will have to try again.",

It's maybe my fifth favorite Indian restaurant within the city and it won't even stand up next to the ones in the suburbs. That being said some of the dishes were pretty well done, like the Chaat, the goat Momo's, the Paneer Tandoori, the Gruyere Cheese Naan, and the Shahi Korma. I think the Pistachio Paan Kulfi wasn't even good though. That is not what actual Kulfi tastes like and adding paan to if did not make it better. And my friend said she's had better Kulfi from Costco. The ambiance was nice, the service was excellent, and the drinks were okay. I would probably give this place a 3.5, but I'm rounding up.",

Most importantly, the food was spectacular. We got a couple appetizers, the Lamb Tikka Masala and the Lobster Curry, a side dish of spinach and paneer, and the Naan. Hands down the BEST Nepalese food I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve had it all over the U.S. I would even argue that this is the best restaurant in Chicago. Amazing cocktail list, extensive wine list, several herbal teas to choose from, and a menu that\u2019ll keep you coming back again and again. Give this place a shot, they deserve it, and you deserve it too.",
