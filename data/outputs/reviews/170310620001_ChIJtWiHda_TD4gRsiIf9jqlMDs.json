I\u2019m changing my previous review below as they gave me so such a lovely Experience.  I wood have loved this place if the portions hadn\u2019t been been small or the food hadn\u2019t been disappointing. They served us the saddest looking cheese plate with an inedible cheddar. I let my waiter know and when he said he\u2019d take care of it he actually meant he\u2019d just take 5 dollars off the total cost. The lamb was incredibly fatty and the sea bass dish was a culinary disaster. The fish itself was good but the garnish was bitter and drenched in an acidic bitter broth and the vegetables were inedible.  For a meal that cost us over 100 dollars we were sorely disappointed.",

You won't talk about it while you are eating. This is better than ok food at a higher end price.  The service is another ugh! Each time I visit this place I feel like I am getting the cold shoulder. I feel automatically judged and I never feel that way. There is some kind of unfriendly environment here the minute you enter the door.  Sadly, there are not too many options in Boystown for food. This would be one of the better ones. However, the food is overpriced. Maybe they have to charge more to pay there rent in this space. I rarely see it busy.  I never recommend this as an option for dinner. Maybe they don't need more business. Maybe I don't understand what they are going for as a vibe.  I wish this place the best, but it is not an enjoyable experience.",

We sat on the patio which is always fun, it's a good people watching spot. Our server was friendly and efficient, the food was pretty good and the drinks were ok.

Time went by, tables cleared & we still had yet to be told a table was available. Finally our bartender told us we could have a seat wherever. When we sat down, the host came quickly & told us the kitchen was closed, and that they couldn't handle the traffic. If that was the case, why were we not told at the very beginning when it was busy? We would have been perfectly fine going elsewhere. It is very disappointing that we were set with the expectation that we would be able to eat here, then come to find out after waiting that we were out of luck, & the money we spent on several drinks.

We were excited to eat here, and I was intrigued by the menu. It started off just fine. But then things came off the rails. We ordered appetizers and entr\u00e9es all at once. Our appetizers came out and were fine. They went heavy on the coarse salt on top of the charcuterie slab. But it was fine. Then, we waited, waited, waited...for an hour and forty minutes for our entr\u00e9es to arrive. The server came out a couple of times to assure us that they would be out shortly. Then nothing  For an hour and forty. When the entr\u00e9es finally arrived, I was excited because it must be extremely delicious due to how long they took to make. I got the hangar steak, medium rare. And when I got it, it was cold, and flavorless, aside from the heavy dash of coarse salt, which I had to pick off. And the server, while nice enough, didn't seem to care too much that we waited spent nearly 2.5 hours for a dinner without dessert. Not a tasting menu dinner. Just a casual dinner with friends. All in all, it was a unremarkable dining experience, and with how many great places there are to go to in Chicago, even in the area, I doubt I will be back to Wood.",

Maybe he overhyped it and my expectations were too high, but Wood did not live up to that great intro.  There was nothing wrong with the service but everything else didn't live up to the hype.  The menu is small so understandably the options are limited.  The food is good, nothing I remember eating stood out.  The prices were obnoxious for the portions with no real star ingredients that commanded the prices being asked.  The drinks were outrageously small compared to the price.  Several drinks were served in the incorrect glasses, but maybe this was on purpose to encourage smaller portions for more money.  Its trendy decor is inviting and it stands out on a busy corner but I could get more from my money at other places in the area and enjoy the entire experience.",

The server, Patrick, was a nice guy but accidentally entered the wrong order in the computer, so the kitchen brought me the wrong dish and I sent it back.  Accidents happen, but what's important is how to deal with them. They brought my meal out when the rest of my friends essentially finished theirs, and I was offered no drink, salad or anything while waiting. Then when the bill came, I was surprised to see that I was charged full price. They basically didn't do a single thing to make up for the mistake or to apologize by offering a dessert...just something. After my initial 2-star review was posted, however, I'd have to say that the manager, Paquale, did handle it well. He found my number from the reservation and called me to personally apologize, to explain that such service was not intended, and offered a gift certificate to give them another try.",

Then around 15 mins to get our bottle of wine, which came out after the food. At 10 mins I asked about the wine and was told \"it's in the works.\" The manager was also indifferent about our long ticket time - for a bottle of wine that could just be grabbed from the cooler...  When we were finished with our food the server silently dropped off the dessert menu. He barely spoke the entire experience. We seemed like a major inconvenience for him, though if he were simply nice we certainly would've gotten another bottle and probably dessert. It's a shame that a place with decent food has such awful service.",

The waiter had a displeased face as if he was grossed out by us. I don't know if it was because we were Mexican or because we were wearing casual wear (because of the hot weather). Regardless, that should never be the way you present yourself to a table as you're not there to serve who you like, you're there to represent Wood and ensure the customers have a great dinning experience.  Still, I  decided to ignore that and ask the waiter to tell us about the menu. To our surprise, all he could summon was a simple, \"the appetizers are one the left and the entres are on the right\" in the most condescending tone you can imagine. At that point he asked if we wanted to order drinks to which we said we'd need a minute. As soon as he left I talked to my friends and we all agreed that we were not welcome there by the waiter and I told them we should leave, which we did imediately.  In my personal opinion, I am not willing to stay at a place that cannot make me feel at the very least welcome. I feel like he forgot he's supposed to be working us up for tips, but it's as if he decided he wasn't going to get a good one here (or something like that) so why even bother.  I can say now that I will never go back there again. All that I hope is that others don't experience the same.... In case management is reading this and cares; the waiter was serving the back booth/high stool tables (right behind the host stand) on Monday May 28th at 7pm. He didn't even bother telling us his name.",

Took ages to even get acknowledged at the bar and then even more to be served. On top of that, when one of my friends moved to try and get noticed, he got back talk from the bartender who let him know he had already seen him, but was still not serving him. This place has potential. Hopefully the bartenders will adjust to moving a little quicker and bring a little more customer focused.

Service was pretty good, but my favorite thing about this place is the ambiance, and that\u2019s what bumps it up from a 3 to 3.5 stars. I love the trendy feel of this place, and it seems like a great place to get drinks. But as for dinner, the tables are cramped too closely together, so that if you\u2019re of larger than average size, don\u2019t try squeezing between the tables to sit on the booth side, because you\u2019ll just embarrass yourself. We ordered the lobster spaghetti, which was delicious, but was super tiny, even for a small shared plate. Good amounts of lobster though, which a great white cream sauce. Had to go with the braised short ribs too--- but this dish was somewhat of a let down. The meat wasn\u2019t as flavorful or as tender as I liked. Yes, it was soft and tender, but it still seemed dry at the same time, and just didn\u2019t wow me. Overall, it was more of a bland dish. I wish I was in the mood for a cocktail when I went, but maybe next time, when I\u2019m stopping by just for drinks.",

I loved the Strictly Platonic cocktail (made with ginger beer) and their house ale ain't bad either. The portions are generous and reasonably priced; we ordered 4 small plates and couldn't finish the entree!  I love the burnt orange satin high top booths - it's so cozy in the corner spot! The service was very friendly, and very attentive despite the fact that every table was full. I LOVED the beet salad- it has roasted beets, whipped goat cheese, and a beet mousse that allows you to enjoy different textures of the same flavor. I'm a huge fan of the burrata and tagliatelle, but not so much the sablefish or scallops. Gorgeous presentation-- the chef's training at Alinea is palpable.",

Everything came well timed!  Food This is where the place falls apart. The portions were fairly well sized but it lacked many vegetarian options (besides salad and mushrooms). The four of us had the shrimp, mushroom, lox sides and they were ok. Some of the dishes were over salted and didn't really have much excitement to them. I was hoping the sauces would be amazing but it was just ok. For the large dishes our group had the lamb as well as the potbelly (I tried them a little) and they were ok but again it seemed that there was a little too much salt. The lamb was really well cooked and the presentation of the dishes was ok. Overall I didn't feel like there was anything amazing or special - seemed a little lackluster. Their desserts were ok but felt like things I had before - not very inventive but maybe I had different expectations for this place.  Drinks I asked for our waiter to surprise me and he brought out a great drink that we all really enjoyed. He mentioned it was not on the menu.  Please also keep in mind that reservations are required (not sure why considering the place was empty for our time slot for least over an hour). My friends and I went here because they heard about it on WTTW and wanted to give it a try.  Overall I don't think I would come back here for the food - maybe just enjoy drinks with friends at the bar and that's it.",

It was packed (fine), so the host told us it would be a 15 minutes wait, and then didn't ask our name or offer us a place at the bar while we waited.  When we finally found one seat, I squeezed into it and my boyfriend stood.  An hour passed, and no one came with any information.  When we were finally seated, we were told by the waiter that the kitchen was closing in 7 minutes, and we had to order.  I have been a strict vegetarian almost my entire life.  I asked if it was at all possible to make the gnocchi with rabbit confit, sausage, mushrooms, and carrots vegetarian.  Had the waiter said \"no\", I would have gladly ordered the only (seemingly) vegetarian item on the menu.  He just said \"Oh yes, that's fine\" and left in a hurried manner.  When my food finally arrived, I was so tired and it was so dark, that I just ate it.  Later, I was awake for most of the night, deathly ill, and then also for most of the next day.  Upon closer inspection of my leftovers and several others' opinions, there was definitely a gelatinous confit of animal fat that was the base of my entire dish.  The only way it was made \"vegetarian\" was by leaving off the sausage.  I expect a restaurant in a major city in 2013 (practically 2014) to take food restrictions seriously, especially when they can lead to major illnesses (or worse). I have not been so physically or mentally distressed in a long while. Needless to say, I will never return, and will warn anyone I can about this place.",
