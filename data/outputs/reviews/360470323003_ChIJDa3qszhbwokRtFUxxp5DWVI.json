Anyone who\u2019s anyone has been and even though I was amongst the first to score a reservation... it\u2019s almost impossible for me to get a table anymore. The beverage program is out of this world, the starters are divine, the steak was perfect (I hear they have the beef flown in daily from New Zealand!), and the deserts almost killed me. Phenomenal front of house too, the whole crew said they\u2019d just started after years at Jean Georges. Wow! Bright future for Trienta y Tres.",

Although the menu is limited, that's what makes it all the more easy to choose your meal. After you've inhaled your lobster blinis, you are kindly served with a soft cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, completed with a rich custard base and the crunch of a satisfying caramel layer. I do recommend leaving a tip though, or a waitress with long hair will assign you a 500 word essay. That's all!! I hope you take Treinta y Tres into consideration for your very important meal.",
