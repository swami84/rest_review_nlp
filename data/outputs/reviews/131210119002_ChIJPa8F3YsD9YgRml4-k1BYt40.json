We had a group of 30 people with varied tastes. The barbecue and brisket was very juicy, the wok-fried green beans Were extremely crisp and flavorful, and the banana pudding was definitely a favorite. Their bread and butter pickles were a surprising favorite, as well, even for people who don\u2019t like bread and butter pickles.

But it looks like I'll have to take it off my lunch list because the parking lot is way too small for the volume of business and they only validate your parking ticket for an hour. In the past this was not a problem, but now that the market is so popular it doesn't really work out good because it's common to spend 10 minutes trying to find a parking space, then 20 minutes or more waiting to order in crowded lines and get your food plus the time it takes to find an open table to eat at. Not bad if you work for Grady Hospital, but anyone else drives just to get there and lose the value of lunch by rushing through the experience. Any thoughts about briefly shopping after you eat are out of the question. If you drive, its best to visit when you're not at lunch.",

I've never written a review before, but this is something that needs to be addressed.  Not only were they out of everything, but what little they did have they couldn't even get right.  I ordered a pork sandwich with coleslaw and the lady said they were out of coleslaw so I told her baked beans instead.  She charged me 10.50 which I thought was kind of pricey for just a sandwich but I was in a rush to get back to the office so I paid for it and tipped her.  Then the cook gives me a pork platter with mac n cheese and baked beans.  That was not what I ordered and then I realized why the cost was higher.  I told her I did not order this and she argued with me and said \"yes you did\"  Umm... no I didn't and they guy in line behind even heard me order a pork sandwich.  She then said \"well what do you want me to do about it?\"  I just left because I was hungry and didn't want to wait back in line for a refund.  I figured, oh well it will still be good even though I wasted $12. It was not good.  I got more fat than pork.  All the food was cold.  Beans, mac n cheese, pork were ALL cold and gross.  I will never eat here again and never recommend this to anyone.  I was in the food-service industry for years and this service and food was so unacceptable.",

Highlights were the brisket and Wu Tang smoked chicken wings. Loved all of the sauces, especially the coconut lemongrass ribs, unfortunately they were rather tough.
