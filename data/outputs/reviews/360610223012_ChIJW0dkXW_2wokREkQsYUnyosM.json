There are so many excellent places around not tacking on this extra charge, I see no reason to go back or recommend.",

The service at first when I called was pleasant.  However when we arrived it seemed as if their was something going on amongst the employees.  Mind you our food took a hour and 17 minutes.  Not once  did our hostess come over to apologize or to maybe just make small conversations. Instead she sat with another employee and whispered back and forth.  Once our food came it wasn't like  the usual. Grits were loose my fiance fish was over cooked  me and my sons meal was missing the bacon bits that usually comes with the shrimp and grits  our Orange juice was warm and tasted like they used old oranges. This experience really shocked me.  My fiance was also asked for his id. After the order was placed for a belini. In which we were never asked for in the past.  We are in our late 40's. Then we were charged for unlimited belinis. We asked for mimosas, however they didn't have none.  It was just a whole Vibe. But definitely not a pleasant one. I don't think we will ever return.   The pregnant girl who worked there a while ago. Was always so pleasant.  You would never know if she was tired or having a bad day.  Good luck.",

How they are still open is a miracle. problems: 1. no air conditioning. 2. the front door bangs so loudly that you jump out of your seat each time it closes 3. extremely loud blender that made it hard to talk 4. $15 for one waffle (regular size, nothing special) 5. The 2 cut up strawberries that came with the waffle had one rotten spot in each piece of strawberry.  (I sent them back and the replacement ones were without rot.) 6. The shrimp frittatta was inedible: very fishy tasting 7. The final insult was to be charged 18% service charge - ON TOP.  I had read about the service charge, but foolishly thought it was included in the food charges (since the food charges were so ridiculously high.)  The only thing positive I can say is that the wait staff, who seem to be in training are young and doing a great job.",

Did not recieve my salmon patty with my meal had to remind them but that is only after my husband had to remind them that he did not recieve his chicken culet and by that time he was finished with what he was going to eat off of his plate.  And lets just say the salmon patty has no words to describe along with the burnt rubbery chicken cutlet sent out to us. The waiter seemed lost an overwhelmed and it was beyond hot in there. It's very safe to say I would NEVER go back. Sorry not sorry!",

It is a good weekend brunch spot for friends and families alike. It has the all important one-hour bottomless mimosas and Bellinis that we go to brunch for.  It\u2019s been written up in Oprah magazine with a shout out from Gayle King.  The atmosphere is beautiful and relaxed, it\u2019s not crowded, there wasn\u2019t any wait when I went and we did not feel rushed (5 hour brunch anyone?). Love this place will definitely be coming back. It was great to see Donna and the staff again since her original spot on 135th street and Frederick Douglass BLVD  in Central Harlem closed.  I remember spending hours reading and studying in that window seat. Back then it was the one and only healthy eat-in restaurant in Harlem at the time.  Great to see Home Sweet Harlem back and better than ever!",

Coffee is sometimes good, sometimes burnt-tasting. There's a nice brunch deal of dish+drink (mimosa, Bellini or similar), or an unlimited for an hour (is that length right?) as an affordable add-on to your brunch meal.  They're great with kids too; so I often bring my friends with little ones here. Also, for those of us with allergies or dietary restrictions, there are vegetarian (but not vegan-- at least I don't think so, but should double-check) and gluten-free options.

Me and my wife always get the egg combos which come with a ton of food and side of griddle cakes for good measure.The biscuits and the sides (yams, grits, etc) are the icing on the cake of a great meal. The people who work here are so nice and always super accommodating to me and my wife even when we bring our 7 month son. I would eat here everyday if I could. Can't recommended it more.

Went out with the hubby for date night in the neighborhood and walked in on live music and singing. We both opted for the fried chicken special, which came with two sides. We both chose greens and macaroni & cheese. I had no idea there was feta in the mac & cheese and my pregnant, sensitive nose couldn't stand the spoiled milk smell. After talking to Donna, the owner, she politely explained there was feta in the dish and offered a substitute. I got the baked sweet potatoes and was satisfied. The chicken was moist, crispy, and flavorful. The cornbread was a bit dry for my taste, but good, nonetheless. The greens were as good as my mother's, with a nice smoky taste and not too salty. I enjoyed a blended melon and mint drink, which would have been great, if it wasn't for all of the melon chunks and half-ground seeds. I couldn't enjoy it through my straw. It also tasted as if the melons weren't ripe enough, as the drink is not sweet. Hubby had one with pineapple, ginger and mint, which was much more flavorful, but almost as chunky as mine. For dessert, we ordered a couple of slices of sweet potato pie to-go. The pie is always good. You'll just have to try it to see what I mean. The best part of our experience was the genuinely warm atmosphere. Not only were Donna and her staff cordial, but even the live entertainment was friendly and engaging. The singer even dedicated a few songs to our baby-to-be. We really enjoy this hidden gem and plan on patronizing more often!",

My frittata came with copious amounts of food (for only $12) however the frittata itself was salty and again underwhelming.

Our waitress could not answer basic questions, and made no attempt to find out. Once we ordered, we were served beverages. As we waited, a party of four (we were three) entered; their orders were taken and they were served promptly, while we still waited. Finally, we were asked what else we were drinking, so we ordered Mimosas & orange juice. These were served, meanwhile we simply waited for our food while those who came after us were enjoying their meals. No matter what we ordered, we should have been served well before the larger party entered. Needless to say, we opted to leave cash for our drinks on the table and leave.

We ordered the St. Nicholas Park Turkey burger and the Riverside park burger, which was a salmon burger, and cheese and noodle souffle. We went around 7pm on a Tuesday and the place was pretty empty.  Check out this place if you want good, organic food! Or even just good food!",

I am glad that I gave it a second try, because their fish and grits meal was AMAZING! The fish was fried and had a side of eggs and grits with butter (you can have cheese with your grits too if that's your thing).  The only meals I have had at the restaurant were breakfast, but I would be interested in returning and checking out their lunch/dinner options.",

I went around brunch time on a Friday.  I consider myself a French Toast connisueer.  The organic  challah french toast with organic maple syrup was amazing. Great flavor and cooked perfectly.  The menu they had was very diverse which definitely makes me want to make another visit VERY SOON. Everything from sandwiches to soups to salads to delicious entr\u00e9es.  The staff and service was very personable and that is something I value just as much as great food.  The staff made me feel at home . Guess that's why it is called Home Sweet Harlem.  Met the owner and she is as sweet as pie and truly has a passion for food & her business.  PLEASE DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS KEEP YOU FROM STOPPING INTO THIS HARLEM GEM!! I Plan on becoming a regular there.  Hope the staff doesn't get tired of seeing my face :)",
