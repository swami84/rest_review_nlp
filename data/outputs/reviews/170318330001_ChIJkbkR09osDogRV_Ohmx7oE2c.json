Door Dash on the other hand... the first driver pulled up on the street and tossed it by the newspaper stand!  Before I could run down there someone picked it up.  I\u2019m disabled so nothing I could do.  I was so done at that point but the nice lady at Door Dash ordered it again for me and man am I glad she did.

I was surprised that the restaurant was smaller than I expected, but the space was super cute and well-decorated (as expected with anything in Soho House).  I came for dinner with a friend and we got the chicken and waffles, dirty burger, and coleslaw, as well as two kinds of beer on the menu. The chicken and waffles were definitely the best I've ever had, especially with the house hot sauce. The dirty burger reminded me of In-N-Out, but in the best way possible. The burger was a bit small but reflected the price fairly. The coleslaw was a surprise favorite of the night for me. It was light and refreshing, and definitely enough for two or more to share.  I'd recommend coming here for lunch or brunch rather than dinner. When I came for dinner, there were more people there for drinks than food, and the portions also felt a bit lacking. Whether you come for brunch or dinner though, the ambiance and service will be top-notch and you're sure to have a pleasant experience!",

You can add rotisserie chicken to it, and I\u2019m glad I did. Otherwise the salad is just Bibb lettuce and avocado. Overall it was still good but I\u2019d probably go for just chicken as the gf option next time.  Service was fine, the server we had was quirky and kind.

No one was seating and we waited a few minutes. so I went to ask the only worker I saw if there was a host or should we seat ourselves and he rather rudely stated to wait to be seated. Once seated he poured water and took our drink order, then brought my husband his beer. Then we waited and watched 3 other tables get seated and order food before we were ever approached again. I had to stare down a different server to get waited on. Then we watched as everyone else got their food. When ours finally came, half the food was cold (butter doesn't melt on a waffle?) and half was too hot to eat. Other servers eventually started working and it got a little better regarding asking if we wanted more drinks or food, that is until we were completely done and then waited and waited for someone to bring us a bill. The food was good,  but not worth a special trip when there's dozens of restaurants around the area and plenty of chicken and waffles around town.",

I forgot what the name is, but it\u2019s the perfect mix of sweet and heat. Great combo with the chicken.  PRO TIP:  Just skip the fries here. The are just terrible and way over priced. They taste like frozen fries that were reheated in a microwave... it\u2019s just bad.  P.S- Hit the like button if you agree and maybe they will work on them!

The food come out one plate at a time maybe 5 mins apart. After we finished eating we tried getting the waiter's attention but he would just look pass us. Someone from our group got upset and went and asked for the check. He came to the table next to us, after we told him we were ready to leave and he did nothing to acknowledge us, we wanted to go plates. He Never acknowledged us. He cleaned tables' filled water jars and then 15 min later we finally get the check. No worries we got the message LOUD AND CLEAR!",

The food was overpriced and not executed well, one of our food items was legitimately bad (as in bad / sour dairy), and the service was poor.  My wife and I came here and shared the chicken dinner special, which is $40 for a rotisserie chicken and 2 sides. The chicken was OK at best. The white meat was dry, and the seasoning on the chicken was nothing special at all. I expected a very flavorful chicken from a place named after it\u2019s chicken.  One of the sides we selected was mac and cheese. Not only was the texture lumpy and gritty, some of the dairy was bad. It was legitimately sour, you could smell it. When we told our server about this, she told us she didn\u2019t know how to take it off our bill because it was part of the dinner special so we should just reorder something else. After some back and forth she finally went to find someone else who knew how to deal with it.  The other side we had was the Brussels sprouts, which were sufficient. They were the lone bright spot of my visit. Even apart from the mac and cheese debacle, the service was generally inattentive even though the restaurant is very small and it\u2019s easy to keep tabs on the entire place.",

They brought two out and sat them in front of the my friends. The food runner brought the third out (mine) and it was cooked significantly longer than the other two.

So I call Chicken & Farm in hopes this was an error; first person was so confident she could help me, she couldn\u2019t so she transferred me to a restaurant manager. The manager tries to tell me it was for delivery! Huh?! Chicago & Farm upcharges the takeout menu to cover delivery from third source who also charges, delivery, service fee, tax and gratuity?!  Nope not going for that. It makes no sense. I tell him this and he quickly say he\u2019ll get a manager. I thought he was the manager. He puts me on hold, and I\u2019m guessing since no one could answer the question they left me on hold and would periodically pick up, then place me back me on hold. After 11 minutes, I finally hung up.  Cheaters never win!!!!",

Even friends from the South have had good comments.  The reason for the 2-star rating is the service.  First, not everyone's food comes out at the same time. During my second visit, I had to ask if my entree was coming out since other people at my 4-person table had received their food and almost 5 minutes had passed. Second, we've had to ask our waiter for a second round of drinks at EACH visit. You would think they would be more on top of this since it means more money!  Finally, I or someone else has had to ask for our bill at each visit.  It was clear that we were done eating (plates had been cleared) and drinks were finished.  We were just sitting there and kept looking when a couple or group would come up to see if seating was available, and the waiter would just look around and shake his head.  All in all, good food and drinks, but if you are short on time and need to get somewhere quick, this isn't your place unless you are OK being aggressive with the wait staff.",

When you walk in the front of Soho House, there will be a lot of people who are ignoring you , go to your right, pass the bar  and go all the way to the stairs.  Walk up the stairs, down the hallway and you will arrive in the chicken and farm shop.  The rustic decor is in sharp contrast to the rest of Soho house, and I was told by our waiter that the space used to be a leather shop.  The menu is chicken, chicken, and more chicken, soup and salad or burgers.  For dessert your have your choice of apple pie, brownie, or banana pudding.  The drinks menu is more extensive and they offer soft drinks, cocktails, beer and wine or milkshakes.  We took the advice of both our waiter and Yelp reviewers and ordered the chicken and waffles and the fried chicken sandwich.  We've never had the chicken and waffles before, and boy are we glad that we did. Really, really enjoyed it. The fried chicken sandwich was huge and we actually ended up splitting the chicken and waffles and taking the chicken sandwich home. Our side was the coleslaw, which was a large bowl and was shared by two people.  If you order one of the lunch specials, you have a choice of a dirty burger or a dirty Cop Out Burger, the fried chicken sandwich, or a quarter chicken. These are each served with your choice of one side and a soft drink or iced tea.  For dessert we had apple pie which was very authentic American, great tasting and reminded me of the kind your mom used to make.  The restaurant is very casual and I would recommend making a reservation for the weekends.  They definitely know how to do chicken, and I look forward to returning to trying one of their burgers.",

The nuggets are a bit over battered...meaning there was so much breading it took away from the chicken, made it seem a little chewy. I wouldn't recommend those, but tried a friend's chicken dinner and it was amazing. The cornbread was also tasty. Be mindful, though, greens and beans are made/seasoned with pork so if that's an issue don't order them. Corn comes with cilantro - so if you don't like cilantro, like me, order it without cilantro.   The millions of peaches was a strong summery kind of drink but not sweet as expected, but comes in a larger glass than the other mixed drink options made with dark liquor. Great ambiance for a Friday after work--hardly no one there until after 6:30pm. Earlier this year.... I ordered the fried chicken sandwich plain with white cheddar cheese along with fries (lunch special comes with a side and soda...otherwise everything is a la carte). The fries weren't good, so I was glad when I decided to switch to corn -GRILLED SND BUTTERED TO PERFECTION!  The bun for the sandwich was super moist making the sandwich extra delicious.  Finally we ordered the warm brownie with ice cream- a wise choice !! This is upstairs from the exclusive SOHO HOUSE CHICAGO, but it is open to the public thankfully.",

I will admit, I was a little intimidated by how large it was so I had to cut it in half in order to make it more manageable. For sides, I ordered the cornbread and Mac and cheese, both of which were just ok and at the end of it too much, since the sandwich itself was so much.

        "caption": "The restaurant is inside Soho House and has a rustic decor and not many tables.  We arrived around 7pm and there was no wait.  The menu is very simple, you order a size of a chicken of which we ordered a full chicken for two people with about 1/3 to take home for leftovers.  You also order a bunch of sides that you can share.  I liked the concept and the menu concept of having chicken is actually pretty original I thought for Chicago.  The service was great and the atmosphere was nice with trendy rustic decor.  The only downside was that the table was pretty small for 4 people and with the amount of food you are ordering.",
