Acknowledging that most of their business is take out, when you eat in you have to be prepared to experience a bit of foot traffic, delivery guys walking in and out quite frequently. However on Sunday, 6 delivery guys where standing around in the back of the restaurant (place is small) by the kitchen entrance/restrooms, talking loudly and constantly walking back and forth between smoking cigarettes outside and loudly talking inside/on phone. It felt like a train station and we where actually the only customers in there at that point.  This wasn't by far the worst of it. Our server had a cold and kept pulling up snot, coughing and picking his nose. I was so disgusted by him constantly snorting his snot back up his nose (instead of simply using a tissue), we requested boxes to take our food to go and left to finish our dinner at home. Needless to say I have first symptoms of a cold today with a cough and sore throat. This is so gross and simplest service industry rule number one, DON NOT COME TO WORK WHEN YOU ARE SICK, you spread is to dozens of people through food handling!  Extra bummer: the rice was undercooked (absolute first for me in an indian restaurant). Another last bummer, my husband is allergic to almonds and we had slices almonds sprinkled over both our dishes, after we intentionally ordered none of the sauces that contain almonds. Unfortunately will never be back. :/",

As a Bangali customer they take good care, behave very well even they make the dish special for me. They are very caring for all the customer, this is the reason they have been running the business successfully since 2010.if those reviews were true, they had to close the restaurant right after they started. I would suggest customers that do visit the place,  you will find the best customer service",

I ordered from Seamless, and since their terrible user interface won't let me rate the restaurant on their site, I'm posting here.  Ordered some of the basics, Tikka Masala, Curry, Kathi roll, naan. Aside from the naan everything else was awful. Granted, I ordered late at night, but still the meal was basically inedible, and expensive. The Tikka and Curry sauces were basically just greasy paste, and the kathi roll was literally just raw tomato and lettuce wrapped in fried naan. Even the rice was overcooked.  I never post Google reviews, but this was garbage and I'm pissed that Seamless won't let me rate it there, so here we are. Again, can't understand why this restaurant is so highly rated. Complete waste of money, don't even bother.",

You get a soup, 2 appetizers, one delicious warm Naan bread, one tea', and 2 main courses for $14.95. Probably the butter chicken is one of their best and our favorite dish!  All the waiters are all really friendly. The last waiter we had, named \"Monzu\", was so great that we couldn't ignore to leave a great review about him. Probably one of the most genuine nice waiters we've had in a long time. He made us change some stuff we wanted different on our dinner special and even offered us an extra soup and one extra appetizer. If you like Indian food, are hungry and want to spend little but still eat great food, go here!",

The vegetable samosa (and meat samosa too) is big and very flavorful that also goes greatly with the soup. The sauces that come with the meal (one is a sliced red pepper, another is a green sauce and another brown) are very nice ways to bring out the taste. The chicken was very nicely cut and full of masala goodness. Absolutely delicious. The rice portion was huge and had some good qualities to it - not too watery, not too hard.. very delicate.
