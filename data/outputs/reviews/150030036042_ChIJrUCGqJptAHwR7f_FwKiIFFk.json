Use one of the 3rd party apps to order, even if you're doing pick up, or call your order in...  Because I ordered my food online and it didn't work, when I got to the restaurant to pick up my order, it obviously wasn't ready because the lady didn't even get my order in the first place, BUT, she was super apologetic and kind about it.  She felt really bad and got my order in and done as quickly as possible with only one person cooking, and other people in the restaurant.  As for the food, it was really tasty.  We ordered the ceviche sampler, and the flavors were so good, the fish, talk, shrimp, was perfect. Order this if you love lime, cilantro and seafood.  We also order the seafood rice, Arroz con Mariscos, It was really good as well, the spanish rice with the seafood flavors, so much crab too. Awesome.  The seco de carne the meat was sooo good, just wish it was cut smaller, but flavor was awesome. I don't like beans, so I can't comment on that, but my SO said it was good.  And last was the Lomo saltado, this was really flavorful too, make sure you dip the meat in the sauce. So good. So full.  Overall the food was really good, the customer service was really good as well.  We will definitely be ordering here again, but over the phone next time. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udc4d",

The bench or whatever they sat me on was not strudy, I felt like it was going to fall forward at any second.  I overlooked that.  I cannot overlook the extra charge for using my credit/debit card.  Simply because I was not made aware of this.  I don't mind paying an extra fee if I am told about it, even at the last moment.  When I asked about the charge, our wonderful server quickly changed her attitude towards us.  This is why I am giving a 2 star rating.  Not informing the customer about charges is bad business, having a bad attitude about the customer asking questions is even worse.  How situations are managed is important to me.  The food was good, the yucca frita was delicious.  The dipping sauces were on point.",

To be absolutely clear to this \"owner\", IT'S YOUR SERVICE THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. not just at the restaurant, but as it's CLEARLY reflected in the seeming lack of ability to take responsibility for your actions in HOW you're (only) addressing 1 and 2 star reviews. ---------- UPDATE: Based on the response from the \"owner\" I can see why I received such horrible service. You think I'm nitpicking because I'm in a hurry and I'm cheap?? Wow, your fake apology and insistence on making it my fault is perfectly in keeping with my experience at your restaurant. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR BUSINESS. --------- We were the only other couple at the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday. As we put in our order, the person serving us told us some confusing story about the salad pictured. The name of the pictured salad correlated to the crispy chicken that we were looking for so we were okay to proceed with the order as we gave it. After about 10 or 15 minutes (!!), he comes out and tells us that he \u201cchecked\u201d the slow cooked chicken that was a part of our other order and that it won\u2019t be ready for another 30-40 minutes so I should choose something else. Absolutely no apology for the fact that he took that long to \u201ccheck\u201d on the chicken. No suggestion to help me make a decision and reduce the wait time. He just told me I need to pick something else and bounced. I decided not to pick anything else because I just didn't want to wait for the strangely slow moving service for the 4 of us that were in the restaurant. We ate the salad, got the bill and realized he was charging us for the more expensive salad plus an up charge for the chicken added to it. I tried to explain our side to clear up what our intentions were because at that point I wasn\u2019t willing to pay 50% more for a salad that we had no intention of getting. I wasn\u2019t able to see it but my wife tells me he had the gall to look annoyed. In the end he discounted the status of the bill by 50%, but the experience was so horrid that I just about hated every bite of that salad.",

The fish was fresh, and it was made in true Peruvian fashion with sweet potato (camote) on the side.  Perfectly seasoned and tender.
