Then, they gave me the wrong order. I came home and called them saying  I got the wrong thing, all they did is say sorry and didn\u2019t take any action regarding it. And the food was a waste of money. They just warmed up old food and put it in a bag. Disgusting!! And it\u2019s also very overprice. I had higher hopes from them but they let me down.",

Since I moved to this country in 2012 from Bangladesh, I have long been craving for some good old fashioned \"Puran Dhaka Style\" Kacchi Biriyani. However, I was disappointed by all the restaurants so far until I found Khalil Biriyani House. Their Biriyani was just perfect- flavorfull but not overwhelming, meat that falls off the bone and melts in the mouth. Overall it waw such a delight. It brings back memory from home. I live in Queens and I paid over $50 in Uber ride just to get there for $39 worth biriyani- but it was definitely worth it. I hope they will keep up the quality, and I will be visiting them over abd over again!!!!",
