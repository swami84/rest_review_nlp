I had the Ba Bong which is a vermicelli noodle bowl with beef and vegetables and a homemade dressing, it also comes with a crispy egg roll. My friend had the beef lo lac which is stir fry beef with rice and a different but equally tasty homemade dressing. I highly recommend both dishes! Everything tasted homemade and comes with tips on how to enjoy it the best way. We placed an order for pickup; it was quick, clean and efficient. If you haven't been to this little gem, definitely try it (especially the egg rolls)!",

Compared to most Thai or Vietnamese restaurant menus, the menu here is more limited, but there's enough to choose from to satisfy most people.  The food was very tasty, and everyone I was eating with ate everything on their plate. Additionally, afterwards the chef / owner came out to our table, introduced themself, and asked if we were happy with our meal. We got into a short conversation with him, and he was super friendly and nice.  My only (small) complaint is that they don't really allow customers to request that the food be made hotter (by adding more chili or spices) or less salty or sweet--the chef has a recipe and sticks to it.  That said, the food was very good, and the staff and owners were much friendlier than found at the average restaurant. Support local small business owners--eat at Prum's Kitchen!!",

Wonderful addition to GNV!  **UPDATE** By now I've been eating here atleast 3 times a month for the last 7 months or so. The food is consistently top notch (I always end up eating the beef loc lac). Leanna and Bo Prum are wonderful human beings and they take good care of their patrons. As someone who is still fairly new to Gainesville and many many miles away from home, Prum's Kitchen is one of those lovely spots that makes Gainesville home for me!",

I ordered the Ba Bong entree and Salt & Pepper wings appetizer, and my roommate ordered the Loc Lac entree, all of these were delicious. Our service was exceptional, and the server and owner checked on us multiple times to make sure we were satisfied and had everything we needed. The owner Bo also spoke to us after we ate and was happy to explain the flavors in our dishes. Thank you to the Prum family for this wonderful introduction to Cambodian food!",

I got two entr\u00e9es: Ba Bong and the Chicken Skewers (came with rice and salad).  I am SOOO IMPRESSED!! I almost finished the Ba Bong and started eating the skewers already!! (This was supposed to last me until tomorrow evening. :( )  Ba Bong: juicy stir fried beef, FRESH vegetables (lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots and cucumbers), and the egg rolls that it comes with were sooo tasty and freshly fried!  Chicken Skewers entr\u00e9e: rice was so fresh!, the marinade for the marinated mini salad was also good (has ginger, by the way!) and is a good palate cleanser; chicken was grilled perfectly, flavorful and moist!  For dessert, I split the mango sticky rice with my roommate: perfect amount of sugar <3, the mango was so RIPE!!!, the rice\u2014indeed sticky! Haha  Now, for the atmosphere:  The decor is beautiful and reflects part of the Khmer culture (mostly the intricate paintings!).  The owners and other employees are so sweet!! and able to kindly and patiently answer any inquiries about menu items. They are clearly invested in the restaurant and in their customers.  The restaurant itself is SO clean and looks well maintained.  The prices are good for the quality and quantity of food.  Overall my first experience purchasing takeout from Prum\u2019s kitchen left me completely satisfied. :) I definitely recommend!",

We have been wanting to dine at Prum\u2019s when they first opened months ago In Gainesville but time got away from us until today. Tonight, due to virus, we ordered curbside and picked up a family order to enjoy at home.  When we called in our order we received wonderful advice on which items to order as we we\u2019re unaccustomed to Cambodian  cuisine.  We have only ordered take away foods twice in the  past 8 weeks but our next order will be with Prum\u2019s Kitchen again.  Well Done, Prum\u2019s We certainly enjoyed our meal !",

I assumed it would have similarities to Vietnamese or Thai, but when I heard authentic Cambodian food, you know I was expecting some real Asian stuff. Funky stuff, you know? Well, the food pretty good, but pretty basic in terms of flavor profile.  I ordered the beef skewers, ba-bong, and crispy egg rolls. The beef skewers tasted great, and I thought the ba-bong was decent, not great. Overall, it seemed like stuff I could have gone to any of our local Vietnamese restaurants and ordered. The prices would have been cheaper there. Also, unlike the Vietnamese resturants who have like 30 items, this place has 4 items. Usually, this might be a selling point, but kind of disappointing when they are things I could get elsewhere.  I will say the boba ice tea (basically Thai tea with boba) and the boba iced coffee (similar, if not the same as iced Vietnamese coffee) was great, but i guess I've never had bad Thai tea.  I guess if there's one thing I had to say, it would be: while the food is decent, if I hadn't known it was a Cambodian restaurant, I would have assumed it was an overpriced Vietnamese one.",
