But we asked him about what came with it and he said it was ALL ala carte.  Well we proceeded to order two sides each and that was ridiculous as our table was packed with food. He had us order all of that food unnecessarily. So we didn\u2019t complain there as my wife didn\u2019t want to spoil the evening. But I just can\u2019t let it go. Now, it\u2019s not the money but he should know the menu or ask someone before having people spend on things they don\u2019t need.  I have been to Morton\u2019s on other occasions and NEVER had an issue but he just ....... My wife doesn\u2019t want me to put his name here which I feel I should but. I just want people in the future to ask about what comes with their meal.  Since our visit I have spoken to the manager and he apologized for the waiter and he has since rectified the situation. I definitely highly recommend this location for your dining pleasure.",

There were no tables available at any of these between 6 - 8pm but there were plenty at Morton's so we decided to give it a try. Now I know why.. The food was fair at best, but nothing great. We ordered the Grand Seafood tower and the lobster that came with it looked  more like a crawfish tail, It was tiny. The Shrimp were tasteless. The sides selection was OK and the steaks were blah. Our server made a mistake and put in the wrong steak for my wife (it happens) so when the steaks came out he had to take hers back and leave my daughter and I to start eating so ours would not get cold while my wife waited for her correct meal. Again, it happens. The worst part was after the steak finally arrives, a manager came over to apologize an ask how everything was. How do you think it was?  He should have at least offered my wife a free drink, a desert or something, but he did not. Terrible customers service on his part. We will not be returning.",

After ordering, I realized I made a mistake and neglected to request the steak be bagged separately from the rest of the hot food. I called up to make this request and the gentleman I spoke to was professional, friendly and accommodating. When I arrived to pick up our food, everything was ready for me, exactly on time. The steak was bagged separately (as requested) and our desserts were also separate, so they wouldn\u2019t melt on the way home. I really appreciated this thoughtfulness. We put our hot food in the warming drawer when I arrived home so we could start our evening with a martini. When we opened our entrees and sides to eat, we were extremely impressed. My husband had his 16oz Centre cut Rib eye rare and it was perfectly cooked. He raved about it. He said the cognac sauce au poivre was tasty and he was so happy he ordered it. The side dishes we ordered were decadent - sour cream mashed potatoes, The Troy and grilled asparagus. All lovely (and truthfully we had some left over to finish the next day, it was a lot of food). I had the Miso Marinated Sea Bass and it was wonderful. Opening the to-go container, the air was filled with a delicious, fragrant smell. The sea bass was perfectly cooked - moist, mouthwatering - a perfect texture. The broth and bok choi it was served with were both lovely. We didn\u2019t have room for dessert, so ate our desserts the next day. Delicious. My husband loved his New York Style cheesecake and my key lime pie was perfect - tart and beautifully textured. Next time, we will order appetizers.",

My wife sent her steak back.  While waiting for the steak we proceeded to eat our mashed potatoes.  We were shocked to see a bug crawling in the potatoes.  We immediately notified the nearest waitress who initially said it was \"chives\", until the bug moved and she surprisingly said \"Oh my, I apologize\" and proceeded to take the potatoes away.  Of course, we were given another side of potatoes, but my wife still did not have her steak.  Our waiter still had not returned to our table.  My wife still did not have her steak.  Our appetite was ruined and we decided we were done and ready to leave.  The Manager comped my wife's steak and the potatoes.  He did apologize as he gave me the bill for my steak and a salad.  Really????",

Also ordered a salad as main course and when delivered to table it was a plate of lettuce! no tomato, no peppers, no onions, no cucumbers..nothing but a plate of lettuce for $13. They did take that of off the bill but what a way to celebrate xmas eve. that experience completely put a cloud over the celebration. Never again. Poor service, poor quality of food selection for allergies. have eaten at several comparable and lesser reputable restaurants which have gone out of their way to accommodate this allergy concern and provided a quality meal. Despite it being xmas eve the restaurant was not busy so that was not the reason for the poor service. many empty tables.",

This is Maryland so we know what crab cakes are supposed to taste like. Morton's doesn't even come close to a premium Maryland crab cake. I discussed this with the manager. He said that they were required to use the recipe that comes from corporate headquarters. Apparently, the head chef at the corporate level isn't from Maryland. The crab cake they serve at Morton's is small, dry and uninteresting. Morton's is a premium restaurant. They should either serve excellent crab cakes or take them off the menu. ============ Terrific steak place. A bit pricey, but they let you split meals, and when you do, you still get plenty to eat. I had a French onion soup and a chopped salad. Both were delicious. Then my wife and I split a bone in rib steak,also delicious. If you are near the inner harbor in Baltimore, this is a great place to eat. I am writing this review on a Saturday evening, and the place is pretty full. But I have been here for dinner on weekdays, and it's quieter than on weekend evenings.",

The food was just right, salad, etc. etc. We compared it to our Morton's experiences closer to home in Tyson's Corner (now closed) and Reston, VA. Last night was a disappointment. Waiter tried hard but came up short. The salad I ordered wasn't the salad he delivered. He let his own thoughts get ahead of himself and really didn't listen to what I ordered. We couldn't finish our steaks and asked that they and the vegetables be boxed up separately. We were returning to our home and my out of town nephew, whom we were entertaining, was returning to his grandmother's house. Imagine our surprise and disappointment when we both arrived at our destinations to find the food had been switched -- my nephew got my food and I got his. Not returning to Baltimore anytime soon......",

I mean melt in your mouth tender. We chose the creamed corn and sour cream mashed potatoes for our sharable sides. We couldn't believe how well our steaks were seasoned. And have I mentioned tender yet?! LOL. I finished off with bread pudding for dessert which I had to take the majority of it home. (Being greedy ordering it in the 1st place if I'm honest) Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an outstanding dining experience at Morton's Baltimore, you will not be disappointed.

Kept tracking the location and realized it started to move when they closed and the employees left. Continued to track the phone overnight and provided the information to the management. The gm (Sam) n the management were very helpful in retrieving the phone back from the now former employee. It was unfortunate that an incident like this happened but I was very happy that the management was helpful in looking into details (checking with corporate to check addresses of employees to see if it matched the pinpointed address I provided with the phone tracker and much more) when they could\u2019ve easily try to protect themselves and their employees and simply said sorry about my phone with a smile.

What arrived was a room temperature cut on a hot plate that was bland and grisly on the outside. Had to return it. What returned, while seasoned (saw the cook spoon on some drippings) was no better than what I've had at a Ruby Tuesdays or a TGI's. I've eaten at the Ruth's Chris , The Prime Rib, Fogo's, and the Brass Elephant (all 4 or more stars In my opinion ) on more than one occasion, and have never been dissatisfied. Decided to go different this time around. Lesson learned! Almost forgot. Initially offered to comp ours desserts (plural) due to the mishap, but reconsidered when it came time to order dessert advising they'd only comp for one person's dessert in a party of two? Expected more from what's considered to be a high end Steak House.",

It's Pittsburgh style (burnt outside, raw/purple inside). Sent back again. 3rd time comes out. Same steak as the second one ($60 steak). Now it's all messed up. Well-done here, medium there, medium-rare in 1 spot.  Sent back. 4th time. Comes out medium-rare. Excellent finally. Up to this point, not the server's fault. Desert takes another 15 mins to come out after dinner is done. Then after desert, takes another 20+ minutes to pay and leave..... Happy Valentine's Day...",

While the food was what you would expect for the money, the service was not, and a major detraction. To me, at any restaurant, service is as important as the meal. The waiter seemed to be somewhere else all the time; and we felt like we were being \"fit into\" his mission. Moreover and what made the experience unpleasant to all at the table: He pushed to up-sell us ON EVERY ITEM. We had to fight him to just order what we wanted. As one example, he was not successful on getting enough side dishes when he first went around and proceeded to lecture us that we needed to order 5 sides for the party. When he didn't get the answer he wanted at one end of the table, he worked the other end. This could be a nice place; their management practice and staff actions made a celebration into an unpleasant event.",

Waiter could not have been less attentive.  Steaks (both of us had bone-in ribeyes) came out cooked poorly.  One was to be medium, the other medium rare.  We could hardly tell the difference between the two and both were close to medium well.  It took a loooong time and we both decided not to send steaks back. Sides were ok but not great (had mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts as well).  At this price level, mediocre will not cut it.  I was there for 1.5 hours and the waiter never refilled my original iced tea.  I had a cocktail that I finished within 15 minutes.  No offer for another.  Same for my guest's beer.  In fact, the waiter came back once after the actual meal hit the table... to bring the check.  Very disappointing experience.  Last time I ate at Morton's was the location in downtown Houston, TX.  Was quite different from this.  I will not be returning to Morton's in Baltimore.  I have been to Sullivan's as well as Capitol Grille (many visits).  I recommend either of those over Morton's.  In fact, I rate Capitol Grille very highly.  Just wanted to try Morton's here.  Now I have done it.  Let my experience serve as a warning to you.

It was fairly busy and the staffing seemed to be somewhat thin as evidenced by the often frantic pace of the staff.  I had a bottle of a German hefeweizen beer, lobster bisque and a combination platter which included a 6 oz filet mignon (medium), three large grilled shrimp and 2 scallops wrapped in bacon.  This was accompanied by three large stalks of asparagus.  I also had a loaf of the onion, garlic, and poppy seed encrusted bread.  The lobster bisque had a forward taste (beef consomme) that hid the lobster flavor but still acceptable.  The shrimp and scallops were average; not over cooked and chewy but not delicate texture either.  I like asparagus but the highlighter thick stalks were a little to woody for me.  Had one bite and left the rest.  This brings me to the filet.  It was cooked slightly past medium with a little charring on the edges.  The flavor and texture is what would expect from filet mignon.  All in all it was a very average meal at a way above average price.  Additionally, management has chosen to sacrafice the ability of its staff to provide the typical attentative service expected in this price range by not scheduling enough staff.  This is in no way a criticism of the staff.  I suggest you save your money and eat at an Outback Steahouse.  Similar quality food and same frantic waiting staff.  I will be going to a local steakhouse house (Johnny's) this weekend to be wow'ed by a steak and make my Morton's Steakhouse experience a forgotten memory.",

        "caption": "We love this restaurant.  I'm a little disturbed by some other reviews that focus so much on price.  If price is your concern, you probably shouldn't be going to Morton's or any of its peers for dinner.  If you fill up on bread and order an entree' with water only, you'll still pay $100 for two.  Add wine, sides, and the must-have desserts and you may get close to $200.  The atmosphere is relaxed elegant - or casual elegant.  One of the reasons we love it here is that t-shirt and shorts on a hot summer day are as common as suits and ties for business meetings.  Morton's is unpretentious in its welcome of guests.  The service, in keeping with the atmosphere, is professional and friendly, and is customer-first-focused.  If there's the slightest problem, one can alert a manager and be sure it will be handled in short order.  That being said, I was also disturbed about some other user comments about service.  If you aren't pleased and don't address it with the manager immediately, shame on you.  This is not Outback, and the experience shouldn't be judged on folksy servers or meals-in-an-hour.  It's a dining experience.  Plan on two hours and enjoy.  Look for their sometimes-unpublished specials:  Steak and Seafood for $99 - includes two salads, two seafood apps, two steaks, two sides and two desserts.  A great meal for two for a very reasonable price for a very filling meal.  The steak is a filet, but some seafood substitutions and steak upgrades are available.  They have some other off-the-menu deals as well.  We our frequent steakhouse diners.  In  Baltimore, we have found this to be the best overall combination of atmosphere, service, food, and price.  Server Brent is always top-notch, too.",
