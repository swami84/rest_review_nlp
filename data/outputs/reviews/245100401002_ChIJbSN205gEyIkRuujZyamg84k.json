She complained of a sore throat and asked the waitress, Rabina, for a recommendation for tea for her condition and was served a hot ginger tea. My friend knew almost immediately this tea was what the doctor ordered. I ordered Nepali unsweet ice tea which had a fine flavor. I ordered Keema Curry which had lamb and chicken and was very satisfied along with some garlic Naan bread to eat with it. This was a very satisfying meal, something different I haven't had and full of flavor and spices.",

There was a good variety of foods on the buffet with no less than 10-12 dishes to choose from, I would however steer clear of the curry goat as it was more bone and gravy than meat. The everyone must try \"X factor\" of the buffet to me was the fresh homeade chai tea. The service was great and attentive. Pricing is AMAZING for the variety and quality of dishes offered. The restaurant is in a great location suitable for walking, public transit and driving. Overall my dining experience was A+ and I will definitely be coming back!",

There were hardly any starters in the menu except for egg plant pakora. Seriously just one? The main dishes options were good but not a lot. I have been to so many Indian buffet and I have seen multiple options. The worst part was that no one was taking care to refill the dishes. I had to literally told them three times to refill it. Is it really how buffet should be? When I told them they were like giving me surprise reaction that they dont even notice that items are not there. Feels like they have scarcity of food. Who does that? Are you feeding for free? I would say bad customer service and very limited options. Overly Priced.....",

When they said yes, I was hoping to have a good meal, but most of the dishes were almost finished. I expect them to truly tell me that there are finished with the dishes and it would not be a good idea to get the lunch buffet. This is truly annoying. What is more annoying is that 3 people came in after me and they were also not informed that the dishes were finished. I don't like scrapping the bottom to get food which I was anticipating to have. Also, being an Indian, I can truly say that it doesn't taste like Indian food at all. Won't go back ever. Bad food and bad service. I could give negative review if it would have been possible",

We ordered two entrees (mutter paneer and gobi Manchurian) and single orders of butter naan, kheer, and mango lassi. I'll review each element separately but collectively, the meal was delicious. The servings were all exceptionally generous and the flavors, while mild, were delicious and balanced.  Mutter paneer (served with rice): Creamy, rich, and mildly flavored. I prefer a more red mutter paneer but this was a good creamy version. The sauce is thick and and luscious, with gentle notes of cashew, tomato, and cracked pepper. Don't let the pepper deceive though, the cream lulls out any heat. The peas were perhaps 2 minutes overcooked: not mushy but they didn't have that bright freshness either. The paneer was drier than I would prefer, but was generously heaped throughout the dish which I greatly appreciate.  Gobi Manchurian (served with rice): This will never be ideal for delivery. The precious crunch inevitably fades to a slightly greased limp. I was a little surprised to see a mix of cauliflower and broccoli but was unbothered (and honestly they tasted the same). The fried crucifers, peppers, and onions, bathed in thick and tangy tomato-based sauce that hung somewhere between a paste and a glaze. Spicy but balanced and the aromatics remained crisp and refreshing.  Naan: Generously sized, this was a superb naan. Fluffly, pillowy, and fresh. It wasn't over-buttered or over-charred, as many naan are. It had the perfect bite and sturdy texture to scoop up all the thickly sauced bits.  Mango lassi: My least favorite part of the meal, this lassi tasted more like a thinned yogurt than what I picture for a mango lassi. Sour and thick, the mango was a quiet second string to the yogurt. A good drinkable yogurt, but that's not the item I intended to order here.  Kheer: HUGELY portioned in a drinking cup. The pudding was bright, mild, and fresh and the rice were perfectly cooked to a gentle bite. I would have personally liked to see some cardamom or rose-water here but that's just personal preference.",

My friend and I wanted a quick (but substantial) dinner before heading to Center Stage. The quick and friendly service was just right. It almost took longer to decide what to order from their extensive menu (traditional meats, poultry, fish, and vegetarian dishes, plus desserts) than it did to eat! Portions were generous enough to share and still have leftovers. The dishes we ordered appeared to be modified for American palates, so nothing was too spicy, but the interesting flavors and seasonings were apparent. It was not crowded on a Wednesday evening, but there was a steady stream of diners while we were there. Parking can be a challenge, but another visit is in order.",

However, I noticed something odd on my recent visit there. A guy had handed the tip to the waitress in her hand and she looked completely taken aback. She then put the cash on the table and began clearing the plates. The manager then came to collect the bill. I then began noticing how every time someone paid in cash, the manager would swoop in to get the bill. And that's when I realized: they don't give tips to their waiting staff. Utterly disappointed at this behaviour, especially for a restaurant that is doing as well as they are. As much as I love their food, I don't know what to make of all this.",

They were so welcoming !! My server did not speak fluent english but she tried her best to make me feel comfortable. At one point when she realized that she wouldn't be able to communicate any more she called her boss who was the owner. I ordered for Gosht Vindaloo. They served it fresh. The portion was really good. Came with rice but gave me complimentary side dish which was fried potatoes and chick peas. Although the side dish was not great but the gosht vindaloo (which is goat cooked in a spicy gravy) was really good. The spices in the gravy were well cooked.  The rice was also of good quality and not to mention the naan was very fresh, crisp and well done !!  I give this place a 4 star and I would strongly recommend people to go here.",
