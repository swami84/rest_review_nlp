Still pushing it if on a timed lunch. Very surprised by how clean and efficient everything was once inside though.  I ordered their lunch box(B13) and crunchy dragon roll(B37). Pricey but it filled me up well. If you don't know a lot about sushi, the lunch has a roll, 4 individual pieces and a salad. The individual pieces has a punch of wasabi I wasnt expecting. Roll was typical, fresh rice and crisp veggies. For the specialty roll, it was definitely more of a meaty or heavier type of roll. Good for a picky eater though. Of course, if you have never had a Royal Milk Tea I LOVE them. Very sweet, but clean milk tea for a canned one.  It's no high end sushi but it was pretty good overall. Meat, rice and veggies fresh and textured well. Everything looked clean from the counter. Locals seem to love it.",

Apparently they deep fried them, this is different from my previous experience eating Takoyaki. They were ok but I much prefer the soft exterior instead. The waitress that served us didn't seem very prepared to explain to us the details of the Sashimi combo. That was unfortunate because we decided to not order that. Also the menu seems to lack details therefore an adept waitstaff is necessary. We ended up ordering the Margie roll and that was pretty appealing. The food overall was good but a little pricey. Oh and the chairs at the sushi bar and some of the tables are really low. So be careful tall people.",
