I guess the hours until 9pm are not correct? Or they just decided to clock out whenever they felt like it. Need to update your hours on the web if not correct. It's listed as 9 so that's why I came here.  Front door was unlocked, walked in but inner second door was locked. Pulled again because I thought maybe I didn't pull with enough force. No closed sign or anything. The girl at the cashier on her phone just stared at me blankly for a few seconds and then shook her head. I went to Subway instead, that's what I have to say about this place.  Been here periodically before but it never feels friendly. Barely a hello. Sandwiches have never been bad but it feels like the staff wants you to get out before you've even walked in.  I highly recommend the Jimmy John's one street over on Washington. Go there instead. Everyone is nice and cool and will say hi and thanks for coming, have a good one. Only reason I didn't go there this time is they close at 8pm.  I feel like this particular location needs a life line or a face lift or something to prop it back up. Gives off the vibe of an old animal slowly dying who doesn't even want to be here anymore. Do not recommend.",
