Another dish i wasnt too impressed by was the curry soup. I just found it to be underwhelming, taste-wise. But, the taco was delish. I could eat three of those as an entree. The risotto with cauliflower was very tasty and the cheesecake was scrumptious. All in all a very good experience but like in any other restaurants, it depends on what you order.",

They knew a large group was coming for their set menu and it took FOREVER to get our food. Food was pretty disgusting, staff was not helpful. The coconut ice cream literally tasted like vomit, everyone around our table of 12 thought the same. What was supposed to be an hour and half break for lunch turned into an hour longer, please note most guests had to leave early and we had to bring their lunch back to the office because it took so long to get our food. Cherry on top is that a chair broke. We expressed our concerns over everything and they only comped one meal \"only because her chair broke\". I will never suggest this restaurant and will never go back ever again.",

The food was fabulous! lol ordered the barbacoa tacos and crab cakes with a glass of wine for an afternoon snack. Small portions but so yummy. Tacos are $5 a piece so o got two. The crab cakes were three small cakes but between the two was just enough. Add a glass of wine and your day is made. Next time I\u2019ll order an entree and take pix before I devour it!",

I would highly recommend the Kimchi dumplings. The coconut wrap is outstanding and made in house with dehydrated coconut & cilantro. The filling had a light nuttiness with a beautiful umami flavor. We ordered 2 plates, it was that good. The mushroom tacos were highly recommended and were just okay. The seasoning of the mushrooms were delicious and well prepared but the tortilla tasted store bought and a bit old. It wasn't anything more than a standard taco in my opinion. The anipasti platter was thoughtful and flavorful - the olive oil cashews were delicous and the pickled beets were flavorful. I loved the stuffed olives too, it's rare to get a vegan stuffed olive anywhere! My husband had the flatbread and loved it. I had the kelp cacio de pepe which was absloutely amazing. My only critique was that it needed more pepper and olives. I asked for more pepper on the side, which made it divine. The briny saltiness  of the olives was outstanding but there were only a few small chunks, having more would have been amazing.  We didn't save room for dessert but hope to have some next time. The setting is really inviting yet simple. We sat by the window with great views of Michigan Ave. They are currently BYOB for a short while, it's nice to have the option to bring alcohol. I look forward to their wine selections once they receive the license. We will be back for sure!",

Everything, sans the Little Gem Cesar, which we found a bit underwhelming and bland, blew us away.  The Barboca Taco was packed with flavor and set our expectations high for the rest of the meal. The Kelp Noodle Cacio e Pepe was the real winner for me. Absolutely delicious!  We tried the Seasonal Flatbread (kale with truffle oil if I remember correctly) and quite enjoyed that too.  For dessert, we tried the Tahini Ice Cream, something I could eat an entire carton of if given the chance, and the Pineapple Coconut Sorbet, which was light and refreshing, better suited for the spring or summer in my opinion.  What we had a major issue with was our server. We inquired about the Restaurant Week brunch menu and were told it was only available Sundays, which is fine as we weren't aware. However, he never followed up with letting us know the lunch course was an option. We had to ask the hostess, who was very nice and got us the menu to order from.  Bad impression aside from our server, we'd go again to try some of the other dishes and definitely sample more desserts.",

We made a reservation and they had an amazing table for us by the window.  Service was OUTSTANDING.  There were so many options on the menu it was difficult to decide what to order. We had the kimchi dumplings, crab cakes, veggie burger and chickpea frittata.  The dumplings and crab cakes were excellent.  The chickpea frittata had a super fresh delicious salad on top.  The frittata was very heavy, dense, and dry.  The veggie burger was overcooked and a little dry. Although we didn't really like the entrees that we ordered we would definitely go back and try different entrees.",

Our group decided to order family style. Some dishes are definitely standouts but all were very good. I will give a quick rundown of our order below: - Kimchi dumplings (raw) 10/10 - these are EPIC! I could have ordered 3 plates for myself. The table agreed these were the best dish of the night - Crab cakes 10/10 - these were a close second best dish following the dumplings. The are mild tasting yet super flavorful and have a nice crispy outside yet soft inside. - The Plant Bowl - 10/10 - Essentially a 'buddha bowl' but absolutely amazing! This was the largest portion we ordered. It was a quinoa and lentil base toped with a ton of fresh, roasted veggies. This is what I strive to make my lunches taste like but I'm far from it. - Kung Pao Cauliflower - 9/10 - excellent flavor, the sauce was delicious. Perfect combination of salty and sweet - The Cacio e Pepe (raw) 6/10 - light and lacking complexity of flavor -very pepper heavy - The Lasagna (raw) *4/10* - I personally didn't care for this dish but my friends loved it. I don't think I liked they cold 'cheese' and the zucchini noodles.  We also ordered dessert... We came hungry - Coconut Creme Pie - 8/10 - super interesting for a raw dessert to taste so good. I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted more banana heavy than coconut. - Hibiscus Strawberry Cheesecake - 6/10 - Not a highlight for me. Didn't love the lime curd but then again it is just personal preference. The others loved it. Guess I'm more of a chocolate dessert person - Ice Cream flight - 9/10 - The have 5 ice creams and you get to pick three. We opted for Mint, Rocky Road and the Salted Caramel. They were so creamy you would never know they weren't make with dairy products. The Salted caramel was the clear winner. The mint left a lot to be desired.  Overall - we left very happy and ended up with a $200 bill which wasn't too bad for how much we ordered. We did BYOB with no corkage fee which saved us money. I am looking forward to my next meal here and would love to try the brunch!",

After Saks closes, security is there to let people go up to this restaurant. I figured this out after a walk around the block. Once in, it felt like I knew a secret that nobody else did. It seemed I had discovered an exclusive dining club...that was open to anyone and very welcoming. On approach, the bar was empty and, for a moment, I thought I was going to awkwardly be the only one there...but I rounded the corner to a VERY nice restaurant space.  Good atmosphere with just the right amount of ambient noise from the many others who were also clearly thrilled to be enjoying this secret place. I had the Barbacoa Taco -  Mushrooms were great and the sauces and garnish were too but I just wanted more of them. The Spicy Udon bowl was a masterpiece.  Easily the best bowl I've ever had. The warm and spicy cashew-hoisin (hoisin...hoisin...) sauce was a touch spicy but not overwhelming. I dunked the cashews and tempeh in to get them fully coated and they came out very tasty.  Lastly, the little scoop of Tahini Ice Cream (cashew base) was just right to finish off a very filling meal.  It was creamy, not too sweet and very interesting. The sesame seeds and caramel on top were nice. The waitstaff was friendly.  Everyone was working hard and keeping things moving and my water glass full.  I never felt rushed and got some great info about the menu and ingredients. If you're still reading this, stop now and go find this place and experience it for yourself!",

My hubby and I feasted on a bunch of dishes all bursting with flavor.  Barbacoa Taco (5/5) - If you love mushrooms, get it! Lots of great flavor packed into the tacos with oyster and maitake mushrooms, crunchy pepitas, greens, and pepita cream.  Mushroom Veggie Burger (5/5) - Hand-down my favorite entree! The house-made scrumptious breaded veggie burger topped with melted cheese and a meaty slice of tomato sandwiched between a soft broiche bun hit the spot! Even my hubby who despises mushrooms with a passion loved the burger and couldn't taste the mushrooms.  Spicy Udon (5/5) - The rich creamy coconut curry sauce with udon noodles, tenpeh, shiitake mushrooms, crunchy cashews, and bok choy was a nice hearty savory dish.  Basil Sunflower Pesto Flatbread (3/5) - The flatbread was bland and boring, and the only dish I wouldn't order again. I would save my appetite for other dishes.  Apple Beet Strawberry Basil Juice (5/5) - The cold-pressed fresh juice was refreshing with a great blend of fruits.  Secret Garden Mocktail (5/5) The Lavender and Rose Syrup was too sugary sweet for me. Some vodka would have been perfect to cut it!  When I visited a few weeks ago in July, the restaurant hadn't obtained a liquor license so it was BYOB and about to get their liquor license.  Excited to come back to try cocktails and explore the rest of the menu! Delicious vegan food that even my meat-lovin hubby enjoyed!",

Althea came right up on our search for that criteria and so we made a reservation! We didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but the restaurant was created by Matthew Kenney, who created Plant Food + Wine in Venice, CA (in our neck of the woods) and, as it turned out, the menu was similar. I kind of with the restaurants were named the same so my expectations of trying a \u201cnew\u201d place were not slightly disappointed with this realization. hat having been said there are differences and the food was top notch.  My wife (an alum of 2 Matthew Kenney classes in Southern Cal) had the Plant Bowl. She found it to be delicious and filling. It was a lentil and quinoa concoction with a shmear of red pepper sauce, along with carrots, spring radishes and broccolini She found it very satisfying and beautiful to look it.  I had the Kimchi Dumplings. These are served raw in a wrapper made of dehydrated coconut \u2028\u201cmeat\u201d and cilantro. This coconut based \u201cdough\u201d was completely legitimate on these dumplings, and the cashew \u201ccheese\u201d an cabbage pur\u00e9e it was on top of it made a delightful dish for my palette.  I also had a Barbacoa Taco - This was also super tasty. It\u2019s served warm and is mushroom based. I had so much flavor. I could\u2019ve eaten a lot of these.  I didn\u2019t so much like the Blackberry + Sage \u201cmocktail.\u201d  It lists ingredients in this order; Housemade Blackberry + Sage Syrup. Lemon Juice, Rose Water and organic Agave. The drink looked pretty but in the end the only flavor that really came through was the lemon juice and I felt like I was drinking a pink lemonade. I would have loved the blackberry and sage flavors to come through\u2026the rosewater too\u2026but I couldn\u2019t identify any of them in this drink and I ended up sending it back.  We shared the Coconut Cream Pie for dessert. My wife felt  it should be called  \u201cbanana coconut cream pie\u201d as she said \u201cthe banana really shouts at you\u201d. I really liked it. It had a great coconut and banana flavor and I never would have guessed it was dairy free. It also was a good size portion for sharing. My wife thought was too sweet (it\u2019s sweetened with dates and maple syrup.) But she and I will just have to disagree on that point.  Fine dining all vegan restaurants are not on every street corner, so if you are in Chicago and not  necessarily over familiar with their other restaurants, this\u2019ll be a good and novel upscale experience for you.",

I asked if she had any reservations for 4 people (mind you, this is 15 minutes before they close the doors for new guests) and she said she didn't... I proposed that we could have the table if no party of 4 walked in within the next couple of minutes and she agreed. Two minutes later, another couple walks in and gets sat by another hostess (or manager?), they also request the window table and are immediately sat there. I flag down \"our\" hostess and ask her what happened with our arrangement,  but unfortunately she had no answer. Anyway, just annoying and unprofessional. I hope somebody teaches her how to be more flexible. Aside from this, service was excellent and food was outstanding. I will go back next time in Chicago.",

They don\u2019t have their liquor license yet which was fine, because we were able to save some money and buy a bottle a wine from Trader Joe\u2019s nearby, and bring it with us. The service was fantastic. Danny took care of us and made great recommendations and helped speed up our order because he knew we had a show to make it to. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

This place is not super easy to find as Google map makes it looks like it's on N Rush St, but it's inside Saks Fifth which entrance is on Michigan and  Superior. It's on the 7th floor of the building.  The environment is neat and nice. They combined two window tables for us to allow us to have a better view while enjoying the meal.  We tried the taco, and it's so good! The mushroom in there makes every bite burst with flavors. The butternut squash gnocchi is probably my favorite so far, it's warm and comforting, the right balance of mushroom and gnocchi. Zucchini lasagna is less surprising. It's an interesting idea, but I feel like it may taste better if it's a warm dish? That can be just a personal preference. The highlight of the dinner is the new Tiramisu! Instead of layers, it comes with wedges of chocolate and coconut cream. While the mains dishes are kind of small portion, this dessert is pretty big. Three of us shared one and that's enough for sure (we are not super big eater on sweets). But you should save room for this!",

Starting with getting to the restuarant, you have to walk through Saks which really isn't an issue as long as you know where youre going (7th floor by the way). When you get off the elevator, there is a sign and you get greated by the host. They try to be very fancy with their environment, which is great if you are facing into the restaurant or are lucky enough to sit in the corner where the lights are dim, but if you are facing out, your view is the racks of clothes in Saks which takes away from the environment. Next is the service. Throughout the night we were greated with very inconsistent service. The host was great and even offered to take our coats, but the manager was sitting on her laptop with papers spread all over the table next to the entrence, again taking away from the experience (even though that's normally not an issue for me, it just doesnt fit the environment they are trying to create). The server we had gave us what could be pub service at best. Order taker not server. I asked about Matthew Kenny and her only answer was \"I don't know, he is a famous vegan chef\". I found this odd since his name is on the door, shouldn't they know a bit more about him? They also didnt have a liquor license yet, which was totally fine, but their mocktails were not balenced at all, one just tasted of lemon juice, one was way too sweet. There were four options in total. The food was good, not great. The cheese plate was good, but small, which was to be expected. We asked for more crackers since the plate only came with five and we were brought out six more for a charge of five dollars (which we only found out about once we got the bill). One of the cheeses was five star, the other two were three or four star. Total was about an ounce and a half of cheese, two ounces of sliced apple and five crackers. Probably shouldn't have been 23 dollars, but I was okay with it since it is more fine dining. The caesar salad was made into this deconstructed salad with undressed romaine leaves, some capers and croutons and a light drizzle of what was more of an itallian dressing than a mock caesar dressing. The gnocchi & farro bolognese wasn't that at all, at best I would call it a tomato farro risotto with gnocchi mixed in. Flavors were good, but it was too heavy on the tomato and too light on the umami that you should get from a bolognese. The absolute highlight was the \"tiramisu\" which realistically was just a bunch of ingredients haphazardly tossed on a plate to look like a fancy \"oops I dropped the dessert\". Flavors were good, but I didn't get any coffee notes and I failed to see what on the dish was supposed to represent lady fingers. It was good, it just wasn't a tiramisu. All in all, very disapointing, I feel they have a ton of potential, but they just need to take a look at themselves in the mirror and drop the ego for long enough to truely judge what needs to be elevated to create the experience they are looking for.",

We have not gone to a 'fancy' vegan restaurant in a while and were very excited. Everything we had was delicious- the service was great, and the view was spectacular. We came on a snowy evening to celebrate an occasion and the restaurant is over-looking the water tower.  Our favorite dish was actually the Cesar salad! it was perfect for sharing and the salty-briney-ness was awesome. We loved picking up each leaf during our conversation and crunching into them. The amount of dressing was perfect and that makes such a big difference. I also tried a wine made from oranges which was so cool. It is a bit pricey but we felt like we got a good deal with doing the restaurant week.",

There are gourmet vegan options at other restaurants in the city, but none with an entire menu that is made just from delicious plants! The food is really next level. Very reasonable prices from $5-25 per dish and I would say you need a starter and a main per person. Lots of raw options. The $5 taco was actually one of my favorite things! The raw lasagna with macadamia nut cheese was a show stopper.  Absolutely everything we tried on the menu was delicious, and left us both smiling the entire meal, raking in the gorgeous city views and delightful staff!! Do yourself a kindness and visit them soon and often!!",
