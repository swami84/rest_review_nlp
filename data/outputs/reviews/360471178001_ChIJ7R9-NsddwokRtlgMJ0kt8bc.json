The menu never said they would be spicy. We've been to many authentic Mexican restaurants and food trucks and never had chicken tacos that came out spicy. I ordered chicken flautas and they were plain non spicy as they should be which were good btw. The limes were oddly dry, when I squeezed them no juice came out. But I was also disappointed with my Torta sandwich bread being stale and having to pay $2 extra for Oaxaca cheese when it comes included everywhere you go in Corona queens.

I ordered two burgers over the phone for pick up and when I arrived only one was made; I had to wait about 30 minutes for another. Overall, they aren\u2019t too bad and have become my go-to spot for the days I\u2019m feeling to eat a burger. I\u2019ve never eaten inside because I usually do pick-ups, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the best place to sit and eat. It kind of reminds me of how your local Chinese spot is situated.",

This is the kind of food one would expect from a food truck in Williamsburg (but less costly!). I got queso flautas, a spicy pork taco and a goat taco. Savor those last words like I savored the food: GOAT TACO. The meat was perfect, doused with cilantro and more, in a double-shell soft taco. The spicy pork did not disappoint and the flautas were nice, crispy, and cheesy (and covered with more crumbly cheese and lettuce). This food was *exactly* what I was craving - - I'm glad I took the detour from my destination to find something other than the big chain fast food places in the neighborhood, and I was certainly not disappointed.",

To make a long story short, she we review the information, she tells me she is going to run it through again then hangs up the phone on me. I wait, I call back to verify if she tried it again. She tells me she has another call, she'll run it through then for the second time hangs up the phone.  By now, I'm hungry and angry, and irritated at the lack of professionalism that this employee of a restaurant that I have ordered from at least two times before and have used that card as well as a credit card. I have ordered with them before without a problem, not sure what went wrong tonight.  Mind you, I called back and explained myself and said some of the aforementioned and asked, is the order on the way? I have cash, I can just pay with cash instead she states, no, it is not on the way. She says no. I say, ok please cancel the order. I guess that was the adult thing to do? I don't play games and I don't waste my time being rude or ignorant...instead, I'm just simply baffled and how can I forgot to add...HUNGRY NO DINNER when it could have arrived by now. I will never spend my cash money there again. Hope you all train your staff to handle these things better, you are in the restaurant business, not everybody in East New York is a CROOK. So much for supporting your local business. Sooo disappointed. de M",
