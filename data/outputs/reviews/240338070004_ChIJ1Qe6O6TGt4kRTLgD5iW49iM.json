Anyway, I arrived to pick up my order and they had no record of it. They said they have no contract with Eat Street anymore, so it never got sent to the restaurant.  They made my order quickly but of course I had to pay them.  I got a credit from Eat Street on my credit card..PLUS Eat Street charged more for my PICKUP order.

The toppings didn\u2019t taste that bad, but the crust was the sort of mushy kind I don\u2019t really like.  The kicker? $20 each. If you want mediocre chain pizza, go to Pizza Hut or Dominos for half the price. Or do what I do and support an actual local pizza shop, with larger sizes, much better taste, AND cheaper prices!",

I presume the men on duty didn't understand my question because we had a lengthh back and forth of where they were located and my order I placed with Slice app. I finally got fed up enough to say I'd come by at 430 when I leave my office, though I was hungry at the time. When I got there I should them my app and confirmation email. Turns out Slice app didn't send them my order so we were both right lol. (Read: don't use slice app ... even more so, when you're hungry!) I asked/told them they should make me a medium pizza instead of the original small for my pain and suffering lol, and they did. Thanks, Pizza Bolis. Thay made me give yall one more star and made up for the back and forth earlier.",

The second time I ordered from here I waited over an hour and a half and had to call the store to be told that the driver had already been here, knocked on my door, and called me but couldn\u2019t get an answer. None of those things happened. I also left a delivery note detailing where my front door is...just read the note! This place is a joke, order from anywhere else in college park but steer clear.  I called the store and the guy on the phone was friendly, as was I, but after explaining my situation I was offered no discount, no refund or anything. I was told my food would get there eventually...which it might, but cold and almost two hours late.  Would give 0 out of 5 stars if I could.  PS I\u2019ve seen other people also complain about \u201cbeing called\u201d and the store blaming the phone carrier. I was able to call the store from my apartment. I had a clear reception and full bars. There\u2019s no issue on my end, it\u2019s the store. Y\u2019all need to tighten up the ship.  Update: Driver arrives and then tells me he knocked on every door! I was in my living room and never heard a knock at the door (that\u2019s 5 feet away from my couch) and he had the audacity to tell me I needed to leave a note to \u201ccome around back\u201d next time! He said he should show me my receipt, that it wasn\u2019t on there. ON THE TOP OF THE RECEIPT ON THE BOX IT SAYS \u201cBASMENT\u201d!!!! If I could I\u2019d give this place -1 stars. If I could attach a screenshot of my order with the note I left that reads: \u201cAround back basement apartment\u201d I would. Worst customer experience I\u2019ve had in awhile, and I\u2019ve worked in it for years. Cold food 2 hours late. I tipped the driver 20% on my card, enjoy the tip you truly didn\u2019t earn!",

I ordered from here after midnight because not too many places deliver after midnight and my toddler daughter was sleep so I needed my food delivered. When the driver arrived he told me that he does not deliver to the door after midnight and I need to come down from my apartment and meet him at his car. I told him my situation repeatedly and that no where was that communicated to me before or after I placed my order and now after an hour later when my food arrives you tell me this information. He claimed it was their stores policy and that he was not going to deliver to my door. He then tells me that he is going to call his manager to see if he can deliver to my door. I am standing from my balcony watching him because he has his light on in his car and at no time did he make a call to anybody  he then he calls me back to tell me his manager said he can\u2019t deliver to my door.  I then asked if I could call him back and called his manager and not only did he lie and not ask his manager his manager said that he is supposed to come to your door and will call the driver to see what is going on.  Immediately after hanging up with the manager the driver calls me and asks me in a very rude manner \u201care you coming down to get your food?\u201d. I tell him that I spoke with your manager and he said he is going to talk to you.  He then hangs up and I call his manager again who says to me \u201cThe driver is scared for his safety and does not want to come up\u201d. I proceed to tell him how unprofessional and sad this is.

The manager says to me \u201c IF YOU CAN ASSURE HIS SAFETY THEN HE WILL COME UPSTAIRS TO YOU\u201d. 2018 nothing suprises me anymore but really, this statement can be broken down in so many ways that all lead to \u201cjust wrong\u201d.  The driver then calls me clearly angry as if I am in the wrong here and says \u201chow much money do you have on you, I need to know because I want to have your change ready\u201d. He runs up the stairs quickly grabs he money and hands me the sandwhich and I calmly  tell him that what you all are doing is wrong and I am reporting this. He proceeds to yell as he is waking down the steps, \u201c y\u2019all don\u2019t tip\u201d.  The sandwhich was cold and soggy because at this point it\u2019s been an addition 20 minutes of this man trying not to deliver my food.  The driver calls me a minute later telling me to come down stairs because no I shorted him a dollar. I tell him that I did not short him a dollar but will drop the money in the morning.  The next morning I check the opening time which claimed to be 10:30am to give them their dollar because part of being a customer is to assure the safety of the delivery person and count the money he receives and deliver the money to him if he doesn\u2019t do his job and snatches money then runs down the steps shouting at someone and realizes he didn\u2019t get all his money. (Yes that was sarcasm)  When I arrived at 11:00am they were not open however they had their sign up that said opened.  The worst experience ever on so many levels and I will be writing corporate and anywhere else I can to make sure nobody experiences the same thing.  And for real Pizza Bolis y\u2019all need to do better and we need to do better as human beings. If you can take my money and deliver to me after 5pm when it is dark then you can deliver to me after midnight. Don\u2019t lie and make up your own delivery rules because it looks like you are discriminating on the community I live in which I love and have safely raised my daughter in the last 2 years. If you have a safety concern with my community then make it public so we know not to order from you. Be courteous and respectful to your clients and don\u2019t treat them like they have no value because of where they live.  God bless and I hope you learn something from all of this.",

The last three times, after waiting for over an hour (20 minutes past the Grub Hub estimated delivery time), I called the restaurant asking for an update and was told \u201cthe driver came to your address and called you but no one picked up.\u201d I received no missed calls, no voicemails, nothing. Ive never had an issue with any other restaurant reaching me, though. I explained this to the manager but was told, \u201cyou need to talk to your phone carrier, it isn\u2019t our fault.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until this most recent delivery that I figured out the issue...my phone number was put in incorrectly on the Pizza Bolis sticker. Now, I was told by the driver that the manager is responsible for putting the phone numbers in. The last four numbers on the sticker were 8353, my number ends in 8358. I confirmed my number on my Grub Hub profile was correct, so the mistake had to have been with the restaurant. When I explained this to the restaurant, and how this must have been what happened with the last three orders, they offered nothing. I said I believed I should get some sort of compensation because this happened three times, my phone carrier was blamed when it was in fact the restaurants fault, and they forgot my soda, to boot. The manager said, \u201cwell we remade the pizza for you on this most recent delivery.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that to be true because the pizza arrived cold. And so when I told the manager that this was unacceptable and that i was going to go and write a detailed one star review on every place possible he said, \u201cgo ahead, I don\u2019t care. Do whatever you want,\u201d and hung up on me. Absolutely terrible customer service, marginal pizza, and all around awful experiences. I believe in second chances but I gave Pizza Bolis four chances, and so I am done. I recommend ordering from any place but Pizza Bolis. You can get better quality pizza from Paisanos, and they have better customer service, too. Sorry, Pizza Bolis, but you guys have lost what would have been a repeat customer, and I will be sure to describe the attitude you exhibited to anyone who may want to buy pizza from you.  UPDATE: I changed my original review from 1 star to 4 stars, because Pizza Bolis did refund my order today (three days later, but a refund nonetheless, and so I am grateful). I will give them one more chance, and hopefully there aren\u2019t anymore issues next time.",

Best prices you'll find in College Park for the amount of food, great tasting ingredients and if you do pick-up, they can have the pizzas ready in no time!  Definitely worth a second try if you've ever somehow had a bad experience!",
