The curry spices were very fragrant, and the fish was generously packed with perfectly cooked shrimp, chicken, and char siu.  $3.49 lobster sauce on rice is very plain, but the fish cake gives a nice touch to the clean tasting gravy.

The fried rice tasted alright but about halfway through I found an unidentifiable black object in my rice. I am 99% sure it was a bug, it was definitely not a burnt piece of rice and looked very much like a small fried beetle of some sort. My boyfriend ordered sweet and sour chicken and he got several pieces that did not even taste like chicken.  Also, while I was waiting for my order a customer came in to pick up his order and they had messed it up.  Overall the service was fast, and the prices were reasonable, but at the chance of getting a bug in my food I would not risk it again. As I was leaving I also noticed that there was no paper in the window advertising their cleanliness rating.",
