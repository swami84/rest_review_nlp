Sadly they are closed on Tuesday.  They have excellent thai iced tea here but I wasn't blown away by the iced thai coffee.   I've eaten here 6 or more times because it's relaxing to sit outside and have fresh sashimi while people watching in Wicker Park.

So I ended up having to ask her to bring some fresh water with ice in it...lol...seriously??  The sushi itself was just ok...definitely not the best I've had although some of their choices seemed appealing. The rice wasn't fresh and the taste was just off...I ordered the Tokyo and the Dragon. Honestly, I enjoyed the appetizers much more than I did the sushi...In all the service was the worst part of the experience. I went at around 5pm on Tuesday with my girlfriend. There wasn't alot of people there but the servers acted like they weren't on the clock. The one girI  I had to ask to service my table was on her phone the entire time I was there...Anytime I needed anything, I had to get up and ask someone for service, not once did anyone come over to ask me how was everything, or if I needed anything...The only thing I didnt have to get up for was the bill...that they brought without me having to ask...how ironic...  I'm glad to say I won't be coming back there anytime soon if it all...probably the worst sushi and the worst experience I've ever had.",

I thought there was too much breading so it soaked up a lot of grease which made it lose some of the calamari flavor. Next, I warmed myself up with a cup of delicious Miso soup, this hit the spot on a bitter cold Chicago winter night.  I had the following rolls: Crunchy Spicy Tuna - decent, not as flavorful as other Spicy Tuna rolls I've had Maki, Grand Caribbean - fruity & sweet, makes it lose the fish flavor Monster - My favorite out of the 3, good spice to it  I used a Groupon which made it worth coming and it is BYOB. I would come back and try some other items. This is a good middle of the road Sushi establishment.",
