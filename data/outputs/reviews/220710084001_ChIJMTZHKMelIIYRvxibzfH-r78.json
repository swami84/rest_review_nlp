Not complaining about the size since most meals out are way too big but for the price not a good value.  The shrimp fajitas I had were cold and I didn't notice they still had the rails on.  But I will say the flavor was good.  The tamales my daughter and son in law had were aweful.  Could not eat them they were so salty.  The children's nachos and just chips with some cheese melted on top, and way too big of a portion.  Finally the nachos on the appetizer menu was tasty but cold. They looked smaller than the childs nachos. Then they added a 20% gratuity onto the bill.  I'm sorry to say this place won't last long unless major changes are made.  It looks like a nice fun place with a tasty menu.  We did complain about the tamales and the manager did comp them should have complained about the whole meal.  Not sure how this place has good reviews.",

Fast forward to my most recent visit, the food was awful and the service was even worse. The only reason for the 2 stars is because I really enjoyed my cucumber jalape\u00f1o margarita. The other guests didn\u2019t like theirs and thought it was too sweet. Our server seriously was acting like he was high or something...he was really dingy and went missing at times. I ordered the chicken quesadillas...mushy, bland and terrible. We shared an order of queso. I liked it and ordered more but it never arrived. I confirmed with the server on two separate occasions and he said my order was in. He then went missing for about 30 minutes and I had to catch him to ask a 3rd time. He started talking in a fast, low and indecipherable voice. We all gathered that he didn\u2019t put the order in. At that point, I told him to just forget it. Other than my margarita, the valet guys were the only other positive because they were very professional and speedy.",

Decent food, okay Margs but a bit too sweet for me. The tacos were over-sauced. We were brought the wrong set of tacos and our waiter tried to make us keep them (lol).

Nothing was cooked in the tortilla soup.  Raw veggies, with literal chunks of corn on the cob in the soup. Never seen corn still on the cob in a soup.  It was dead in the restaurant so no reason it should have taken this long to put raw veggies in a cup w broth. When i asked about my food the bartender was rude, as if i was a nuisance to him. Total waste of $10. No way this place makes it. Awful food, awful service.",

The conversation had something to do with reservations or something like that, but we were uncomfortable with the way that the hostess was being spoken to.

The bartender said to go with the salad.  100% right.  The avacado salad was light,  fresh,  and super crisp with very fresh ingredients.  This is one of the best salads I've ever eaten. I followed that with chicken flautas- cheap and flavorful. I finished with the chicken tinga tacos and the carnitas tacos. They were both excellent. The service was great,  the staff was friendly.

It was lukewarm. After joking that it should be warm resembling the heat from the motorcycle that pulled it along and there should be gnats in it to everyone's amusement, there was a gnat in it and another on the sugared rim. Our waitress had tables in the bar, to the far back right of the restaurant and another midway on the left. Who assigned that? The service was so slow we only ordered appetizers and our drinks came out ten minutes apart. We stayed about an hour and a half. The free valet parking was nice.",

Great job renovating the restaurant! Eric, the GM has a great F&B background and it shows. The lunch prices are the ONLY thing that kept me from giving 5 stars. As a concierge, I can recommend Nole with confidence to my guests.",
