There was one small restaurant on the East-West highway in Bethesda that we enjoyed very much, but they never really made anything that made us sit up and say, 'Good God! I can't wait to have THAT again!\"  Then one day and almost by mistake, we stumbled into Great Wall Szechuan House.  It was (foodwise) everything we had been longing for: great authentic selection, pleasant service, great prices, and Good God! Food that we could not wait to have again.  The Mah-la dumplings are sublime, with a flavorful heat that your palate wants to resist, but just can't help wanting to be delightfully tortured by it again and again.  Like watching 'Starship Troopers!' When we make our next foray out, we are definitely dining at Great Wall!",

The food comes out quick (which can either be a good or bad thing) and is pretty tasty. Our party ordered Szechuan tofu, vegetable lo mein, and chicken lo mein with a tofu & corn soup as well as a chicken & corn soup (note: both soups seem to contain egg). The food was overall good, but following  were some of my reservations: some vegetables in the lo mein seemed to be a bit undercooked, the soup came out a bit lukewarm, and the Szechuan tofu was very oily with not much flavor coming through. Barring those reservations, the food was plenty and for the most part tasty. The noodles were cooked well and the tofu dish completed the rice well (p.s. Rice is extra for some dishes).",

I get most restaurants close early due to business but she made it seem as if the restaurant has always closed at 10pm. And all I wanted was to place my order to go.  Placed my order togo and left quickly. I made sure to get a quick glance at the hours of operations on the door once more just in case I missed something because I always try to respect businesses hours.  I could see her watching me through the window btw LOL and sure thing, it said 10:30pm  I know that SHE knows that she was being dishonest about the hours of operation giving the look on her face lol  Do you want service or not?",

The decor was clean and intimate and the staff was attentive and  corteous.  The food was delicious and very fresh.  Just outstanding in every way. We are on vacation and it was worth the short cab ride to the Great Wall.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are craving authentic Chinese food.",

The older Chinese and foreigners in the next-door table have tea and water, and they are politely waiting. It\u2019s also Chinese, shouldn\u2019t we young people get the respect they deserve?

The sauce was excellent! My friend ordered the General Tsos which I liked better but it was basically the same dish without the orange flavor. A little surprised the bathroom was down a dungeon-like staircase into the basement but it gave that hole in the wall feel making the place more gem-like  I went back the next day just to make sure I my opinion wasn't ... biased from the previous night... and the food was even better!

        "caption": "I ordered the General Tso's, which is usually hard to mess up, but it wasn't very good. The breading on the chicken tasted slighty powdery, as if it had been coated in way too much flour before being fried. The rice was very dry (almost like it had been sitting out for a while or was microwave-cooked), making it difficult to absorb the sauce from the chicken. Overall, I was disappointed, since I was painfully hungry when I entered, wasn't initially expecting much, and ultimately chose to try it out based on the good reviews. Maybe I tried the wrong dish, but basing my judgment on it alone, not only is the food nothing to rave about, it also doesn't even satisfy that (Americanized) Chinese food craving.",

The dough on the orange chicken was slightly hard for my taste, but the sauce was tasty.  All in all for the price, not a bad place to go. Also, the restaurant seemed to be recently renovated in the inside. So, the picture that is on google maps is outdated. Nice dig indeed.",

No fancy decos, no fancy dinnerware (disposable cups only), no professional server (one of the delivery driver took care of us), but geeze, who cares, the food was really authentic, no differnt from what I had in China, and if we take cost-effectiveness into account, it's one of the best I had, 4 adults for $39, really full.",
