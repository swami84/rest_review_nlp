There\u2019s a cover charge even before you do anything which I found odd. We got there around 8pm for dinner. They seated us in a great space if we were just doing hookah but it was not feasible for dinner. It was incredibly hard to eat dinner with the tables being small and very close to the floor. Many of us had to put the plates in our laps. Which took away from the experience. We ate as little as possible just to quickly get it packed and out of the way. I\u2019d recommend this place only for hookah not dinner.",

Then the party next to us (all males) start dancing and she never told them to stop, she would visit them often so obviously they are regulars and they get a special treatment.

        "caption": "Today my girls and I decided to come to le souk. It was a very dissapointing experience. We\u2019ve been there a few other times but today just ruined it for this place. The spot is very ghetto with horrible customer service. We payed a entrance fee of 10 dollars, which was reasonable. The hostess sat us four in a booth, as we were checking the menus she came over and rrushed us with the menus asking us if we were done. Then five minutes later she comes over and tells us to get up and move so other customers can sit in our spot. We ask her if we can stay and they sit in that spot they are trying to make us sit in. We didn\u2019t want to be in the middle. We wanted to sit in the corner so we didn\u2019t have to be close to other random people. The girl says no and tells us to move again and says you guys will be close in the middle too. I found that to be very disrespectful, like how are you going to come and make me get up so other people can sit there when they can sit in the spot that they were trying to make us sit in. We decide to leave and We ask for our money back for the entrance fee. They refuse to give it back. They give us horrible customer service and thats okay, but they can\u2019t give our money back? The employees were completely trying to ignore us, the manager didn\u2019t even come over to see what was going on. The manager was trying to avoid us as well. Someone needs to teach them customer service and how to run a business. I do not recommend anyone to go there. You will be very dissapointed. And just want to say they don\u2019t even deserve that 1 star I just gave them.",

Chef Kay allowed me to drop off the decorations for the party the night before, when I arrived for the party everything was set up.  We had appetizers passed throughout the party. My guest were able to pay for their drinks individually and there was no confusion. The food was hot and fresh.  Chef Kay and staff kept up with keeping my guest fed and comfortable.  Many of my guest would love to use her space to host their next event. Thank you chef Kay, I couldn\u2019t have done this without you.",

        "caption": "Although the environment indeed contained a beautiful atmosphere, I am utterly disgusted with the poor level of customer service and how much of a RIP OFF this place actually is. According to Springfield Massachusetts Law, it is still LEGAL for an 18 year old to be a patron at a hookah lounge, just because they serve alcohol does not prohibit someone from going there just to smoke hookah. That is the same thing as saying you can't sit at a restaurant because they serve wine! The skinny manager does not know proper etiquette or how to show class with patrons, very appalled at such poor management led by her, she did not seemed to be concerned with how her customers felt or have the slightest idea of how to handle a conflict. What is most shocking is how every time you come here there is always a \"hidden fee\" or cover charge, HOWEVER such fee is considered unethical and illegal, as a business needs to prominently post that, such as a sign, that it levies a cover charge and also list the amount. What is most appalling is how this establishment OVERCHARGES on receipts and exploits from unaware customers. There have been several times that I have been here as a patron, they have charged me for more than one hookah. But the worst experience of all came from the black bouncer in the front. Never have I ever have been that disrespected by a human being. For some reason he always picked on me and does not know how to mind his own business. Did not let me in with my family on their wedding day but let's skimpy little girls go in freely without checking ids and have caught him several times getting paid in cash to let people in. How revolting. This place is by far utterly disgusting in terms of managing their establishment, and I will pursue further legal action for the damages they have caused to me and my friends and family. There are so many other hookah bars out there who won't give you such a hectic experience, but indeed know how to provide a lovely experience for you and your friends and family. They are losing more and more valuable customers who used to come religiously every week from different states. Shame on you guys, you are an embarrassment. This is not Le Souk, this is LE TRASH.",

We walked in after a group of people who were welcomed warmly who walked towards a table that was already seated and having drinks. The hostess after being told by my friend that we were a group of 8, before welcoming, smiling and without a beat said to my friend if you are not ordering drinks and only one hookah there is a 1.5 hour limit. Don't plan to stay for 6 hours. She then asked if we still wanted to stay or if we where going to be ordering. i am appalled and believe the reception. I totally understand a busy Saturday night and wanting to get in more revenue but that is not definitely not how a business should build a client base. Service was unacceptably slow- over 30 min for drinks and never checked back on. Music really loud, even above what it would be at a club. Belly dancer however was impressive with sword.",
