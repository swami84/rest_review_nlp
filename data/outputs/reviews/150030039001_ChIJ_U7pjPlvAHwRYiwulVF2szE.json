To be fair, we did take out (COVID 19 restrictions and convenience drove our desire to take out).  So...the shoyu pork was SUPER TENDER, and flavorful...UNFORTUNATELY, the shoyu pork was topmost plate and 1 of 4 plates that we ordered, and that was packed in one bag.  The 20 minute drive home led to the shoyu pork plate spilling over as the plate at the bottom collapsed under the weight of the 3 other plates above it.  SO, for us, everything under that shoyu pork (again, it was pretty good) had a nice enhanced flavor of the shoyu pork sauce.  IF you order take out from them...ask them to pack no more than 2 per bag (or whatever depending on what your order is), just so you avoid what happened to us.  Pictured is the bottom most plate, and the amount of shoyu pork sauce that was in the bottom of the bag after unpacking.",

When it arrived it was well packaged, food looked great in the travel tray, I can only imagine how much better it will look on the plate. Everything we asked for arrived, so no annoying call back necessary, therefore I am taking the time to acknowledge this business instead. We had the fried chicken, excellent! The Korean bbq beef, fantastic! The egg whites with veggies, scrumptious! And the pineapple cream pancakes, pure heaven!!! lol.  Thank you! See you soon!!",

My wife orders the pork cutlet bowl which is supposed to come with sides. They bring it with none. We ask the wait staff and one says it doesnt and the other says it does. So she gets no sides. Person next to us orders same thing and gets sides. It makes no sense. They do not offer to fix either my overcooked eggs or her lack of sides.
