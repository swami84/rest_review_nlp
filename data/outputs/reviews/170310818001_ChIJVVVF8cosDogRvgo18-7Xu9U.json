Not only did the correct food get here (hot and on time), but they had included some wonderful birthday treats for me as well.

Now we've found ourselves ordering delivery from Victory almost every Friday. The food is absolutely delicious. A few highlights and go-to items: Grigliato Misto is a great appetizer, lots of fresh seafood. The brussel sprouts are amazing, we order those every time! Pizzas are all great, we especially love the Elmwood Park and the Arugala & Prosciutto. The meatballs and the sausage and peppers are phenomenal as well! My wife always gets the meatball salad or the eggplant stack for her entree, which both are always consistent and great. The pastas are all great (probably most notably, the Nonna's Gravy). Chicken dishes are all great, but the standout is the Chicken Saltimbocca, that is my new go-to order. As a bonus, they always include a slice of their garlic bread with each order, which is great.  On a side note, the delivery food is always very well-packed for travel and arrives hot. I can't say that about many restaurants consistently, but we have never had an issue with Victory delivery.  Overall, can't speak highly enough of Victory. And whenever we bring guests there, they always leave raving and plotting their next trip.  Can't wait to return in person",

This is my second visit to Victory Italian, and I decided it was time to take my girlfriend to this gem. From the moment we arrived the staff was friendly and courteous. We were greated immediately and seated right away. The manager Jason came to welcome us to the restaurant.  The menu is vibrant and flavorful,  the more I saw the more hungry I got, but the garlic bread that was brought to the table helped me a bit to focus. We got a nice 2017 bottle of Daou which is a staple in my home, it just never disappoints.  On the calamari was spectacular! Fried to that perfect crisp golden brown and you can you tell it's going to be amazing by just looking at it. This fish is paired up with a really tasty cocktail sauce and a touch of horseradish. Now the main course was serious. My girlfriend went with the gnocchi with sausage and mushrooms, she did not speak to me the whole time we eat. The only thing she said if I recall correctly was \"Oh. My. God.\", until I decided to switch plates with her because I ordered Joe's Mama's Meatballs. BUT!! I asked our sever to substitute the tomato sauce for their Vodka sauce! (Who does that am I right?!) I'm so glad I did! I was already in disbelief of what i was tasting. Such a simple dish of spaghetti and meatballs in a vodka sauce, something I grew up eating all the time. But the flavor and the meatballs and the sauce and the wine, it was all perfect for me. When my girlfriend tried my dish she just went on and told me we needed to come back for my dish again. I didnt know I I almostvtisked not getting my plate back when I did that. Desserts were off the hook! Chef's Farina's tiramisu is a really great one, smooth clean, a classic. His cannoli was  a hit for both us, since my girlfriend and I are not big on cannolis,  I have to say this one may have changed my mind about them. 100/10 I will definitely will come back for more.",

We have ordered takeout 5 times and they have screwed up our order once, completely lost the order twice, and been extremely late with another order.  They are severely understaffed at front of house and not trained properly. They have all these screens and papers everywhere and it\u2019s just a jumbled mess. They frequently will answer the phone mid conversation with a customer and continue the conversation on the phone while customer is standing there.  It\u2019s a shame because they are so close to us but we are done here. I\u2019m sure the experience is much different if you dine in, but as far as take out I would run.",

Being further from the theaters, it was full but not S-R-O, and we were able to get a table for two in just a few minutes. The  wine list should please most, with modest house selections and then reasonable prices for finer choices, leading to some rather top-shelf selections for those REALLY in the know.  Your first blessing is the amazing home-made slab/slice of garlic bread. They start with a 2\" thick slice of focaccia, generously love it with butter and garlic, broil it to a fine balance of crisp and bronze, and finally give it a generous dressing of grated parmesan. What an opening!  Come hungry as the portions are nearly legendary; the lasagne is served in its own casserolette that easily can feed three adults (it was the perfect blend of spice, sauce, and cheeses-  offered in both meaty and vegetarian styles.)  So much to love  on the menu, we definitely will be back to try more when we next have the occasion to visit Chicago.   XO-",
