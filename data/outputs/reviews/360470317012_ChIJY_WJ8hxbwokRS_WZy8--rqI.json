One of the Salmon courses, my friend Said had a slight taste that it was about to go bad. He told the chef about it and the reply was \"it just came in yesterday\" .  The hush puppies were burnt and we were told they need to be well cooked.  Since the salmon was off I ordered a seafood chowder. It appeared to be from the bottom of the pot as it was mainly potato and barely any seafood.   They put five grilled shrimp on top to hide that it was a potato chowder(unheard of).. The first and last appetizer came to the table 45 minutes apart.,and 25 minutes between entr\u00e9es ,yet we were charged an extra $180 as we were a table of 8. Our complaints were greeted by the staff OPENLY laughing at our grievances. NO ONE APOLOGIZED FOR OUR EXPERIENCE! I have never been so disappointed in restaurant service as I was during my experience at SAVVY BISTRO!",

When I waived my hand at my waiter, I was ignored on several occasions. I only wanted a refill on the pitcher water, salt, pepper, and hot sauce. The wings were still great. The staff knew that a peddler approached my table and did not do anything about it. The outdoor seating is a great set up. I could not believe this was my covid expierence. The tent lights started flashing different colors in strobes. It was too much to handle and I almost could have expierenced an epilepsy.",

I finally got the opportunity for a visit one Saturday evening. Didn't try the food this time. (But I'll be back).  We got there as the hip looking patrons were finishing up their meal and in about twenty minutes, this intimate, sexy, quiet spot was transformed into \"Night At The Roxbury\" with just the slide of a few tables and chairs.  The DJ kept the tunes coming (he also took our requests very kindly) and other than a couple of folks checking out a BB match on their large screen, everyone was moving to the beats as we sipped.  Drinks were very reasonably priced. VERY. I'm afraid to use the term cheap in case the owners read this review and up the price... chit, I just did didn't I? Smh.  Feel free to bring your little ones to lunch, brunch etc because even though it's only one stall, it's large and equipped with nappy changing table, cute. (There's something wrong with the door latch though. I hope they fix that soon. I had to pee in the dark because I was afraid someone would walk in on me).  Savvy is located next door to a few other spots so make sure you look for some wings and other awesome artwork on their wall else you could easily walk into the wrong space.  My recommendation for a super chill OR pumped up evening goes to Savvy!  I. Will. Be. Back!!!  \"What is love? BABY DON'T HURT ME, DON'T HURT ME NO MO'...!\"  The End.  U P D A T E!: Since writing and posting my above review to another online forum (forgot my trusted old Google). I'm pleased to say Savvy's is still 100 in my book! *I've since tried their food (many different dishes and they've all been amazing except for one particular dish/dip which I found to be a tad too salty. BUT, I don't eat salt so don't hold that against them. *The toilet door has been fixed. In fact I returned ONE week after posting my review and it had already been taken care of! *Also available for private parties!  Savvy's has been going through some changes. Each time I go it gets better and better and even BETTER! How is this even possible?",

We got there just my hubby and I first. No one told us were to sit even though we made reservation. We sat and ordered drinks. Its took over 15 mins to get drinks. The place was not yet packed. Our two cousins then came. The food took Very Very long. The waiter looked like he didnt really care about us. I ordered another drink which took over 20 min that time. My meal came in two parts. Everyone was already done eating before my protein came out. Again the waiter looked like he was in a diff zone. Just uncaring, and uninterested. Nways. The place, music, and food was excellent. The service, not so much.",

For starters I couldn't have a glass of wine to go with my steak and couldnt find the guava in the guava bbq ... shrimp cooked to near perfection fornthe medley but my interpretation of medley was not what the menu delivered.
