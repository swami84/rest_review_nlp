My daughter and I wanted to find a place with homemade Italian food that was not the same old heavy sauce. We also wanted to eat outside and were concerned about the weather because it was mid-March at 7 pm. I called and Gia told me they had an outside seating area with heat and it usually gets very warm so don't worry. Gia wasn't kidding, the outside area was very cute and very warm. There were so many things we wanted to try! I had the homemade Gnocchi Gorgonzola and Walnuts (with butternut squash and asparagus). My daughter had Casoncelli (stuffed pasta pillows with pork, Parmigiano and breadcrumbs in a butter, sage, and pancetta sauce). Both were beyond delicious! To end our meal we shared the chocolate creme brulee and it was fantastic! The prices are very reasonable too even with a bottle of wine. We are going back tomorrow.",

The drinks were even better, if that\u2019s possible. The service was quick but still allowed us to enjoy our dinner. If we lived in town, this place would definitely be a regular spot.

The staff was very apologetic (there was really no need they were understandably busy) and accommodating.  Wine was reasonably priced by the bottle and was a very good meal overall.  Will be back!",

My stepsons didn\u2019t like the menu when we sat (which we were seated at the bar Bc they were booked OR was it our attire?!!). We decided to leave and go somewhere else and since we had been served water were even kind enough to leave a tip for the inconvenience.  Exhausted we went next store and ate.  On the way to the car  we realize we did not have our keys and we left them at Gia\u2019s when we went back they denied having them for two hours and in fact we had to pay to have someone open our car.   Once threatened by 911 on the phone Gia the owner herself came out jingling the keys in her hand trying to pretend like she couldn\u2019t feel the weight of the keys underneath the napkin After knowing our situation.

We all noted the nice decor and ambiance.  And the service was great too!  5 stars all around!  And reasonably proced too!  The bill came in much less than I expected.  Let's talk about the food.  One word: AWESOME!  We ordered so many different things - appetizers, entrees, desserts.  All phenomenal.  I had the burrata and also grilled octopus apps.  Both were great and we eve ordered a 2nd burrata tonhabe more.  As an entree I ordered the Summer Carbonara.  I'd never had it like this but it was excellent!  Great flavors!!  The gelato was great and the selection of cello was the best I've seen.  We had Limoncello and Pistscchio cello.  Suffice it to say this has been the BEST restaurant in Little Italy I have been to and I and the members of my group agreed we will all be going back!",

The menu offers great options for all sorts of tastes, the service was excellent and friendly, the ambiance is lovely, with quirky and colorful artwork adoring all walls (and tables), and owner Gia herself came to our table to check that we were having a good experience. It was delightful and delicious!",

Cafe Gia is an absolute disgrace. I would never eat there again even if someone paid me. Not only was the food horrible, but the server was very rude and greeted us and other guests with attitude. The only reason I can even give this place one star, is because the only good thing about it was the look of the restaurant. It is actually a very cute little place and the art on the inside and outside of the restaurant was very beautiful, but the food does not live up to how beautiful this place was and how amazing Italian cuisine really is. I am amazed that this place is still in business and has such a high rating. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to give a bad rating on something.",

The grilled octopus ($15) was so tender and juicy. The beef carpaccio ($14) literally melted in your mouth. It went so fast. But the main attraction of this meal was the Osso Buco ($35). I get it, $35 is a little pricey for a meal but if you get the opportunity to try it at least once, take it. If was absolutely delicious, I ate the entire thing just because of how magnificent it was. Definitely recommend Cafe G\u00eda if you ever have the chance.",

I've never had a bad experience in Little Italy, so I picked it quite randomly (and because it was open for lunch) It was delightful. One thing I really appreciated was a wine list with descriptions. You can generally prefer pinot noir or malbec or chardonnay, but being able to read what notes and finishes each has is always helpful, especially when you're thinking of what it's going to taste like with the food you order. The burrata was very, very good and nicely complemented with the accoutrements they picked (greens, thin slices of fresh peach, and some other things. Great flavor and texture balance). I got the porcini stuffed pasta pillows and my friend got the bison and ricotta and penne (a very nice take and uptick of spaghetti and meatballs). Despite a cream sauce, the porcini stuffed pasta pillows was very good and not overly heavy. The decor is quaint and quirky. Everything is colorful and decorated, and definitely done with intent. Very Baltimore. The wait staff was very nice and attentive and answered questions. There were several window seats to look out (all taken by the time we got there) Definitely recommend, even if you're in the \"not sure what to get, but want good food\" mood.",

I had arranged to get flowers on our table prior to our arrival; however, they weren't there when we got there so I asked Ms. Gia about it. She had someone run across the street, get flowers, and surprise my date. Simply fantastic, a true gem in Baltimore.  P.S. The Gnocchi dishes here are so good! ------------------- So I went to Cafe Gia for the first time after trying over and over to get in-- there's always a wait here (and for good reason)! From the outside, Cafe Gia draws you in with its eccentric yet welcoming wall d\u00e9cor and murals. Once you step inside, you're invited to a small yet intimate space bustling with Italian hospitality, smells and fragrances of balsamic dressing and bursting fresh basil and pesto. The restaurant has 2 floors and has recently expanded into a bar in the back area of the restaurant. Though I was not lucky enough to get a seat upstairs, the downstairs seating area is more than adequate. Tables are pretty close together so the noise level can get high, but Cafe Gia just has a great vibe to it. Service is excellent as well and the food is some of the best you can get in Baltimore's Little Italy. I tried the Bruschetta antipasti and Chicken Fiorentina as my first entree. The Bruschetta was excellent, as the bread wasn't soggy and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe with a flavory hint of balsamic vinegar. The chicken in my entree was buttery good and melted in my mouth, alongside the side of green beans and giant potato wedges-- simply fantastic. Service was great as well, with all waiters being extremely accommodating. I'd recommend trying the Concannon Cabernet Sauvignon red wine with the chicken entree.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and portions are pretty good compared to other Italian restaurants in the area.  A welcoming, quality Italian experience enveloped with a warm ambiance makes for the perfect go-to restaurant in Baltimore's hearty Italian district.",

The homemade fettuccine was definitely the highlight of the night. Unfortunately it didn't come with my meal. I got the Eggplant Parmesan and although the eggplant was cooked well and was tasty, I found the red sauce to be overly acidic and kinda bitter. Overall, I found the food to be just average. My portion was adequate, but I found almost everyone else in our party had relatively small portions as far as Italian restaurants go.  The restaurant is small and the ambiance was fine. There is only one bathroom. And not one male and one female--there is literally one stall.  Our waitress was friendly but horrible overall. It took a LONG time for her to come by and take our orders, she never came by and asked if everything was okay, and it seemed to take forever for us to get our check at the end of the night. We decided to skip on dessert because we didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for the dessert menu.  There was really nothing special about this place. Just average and I won't be sad if I never go back.",
