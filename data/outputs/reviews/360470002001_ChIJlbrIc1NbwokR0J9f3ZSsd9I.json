They have a heater over the table.  The garlic bread that came with the seafood was to die for.  We had chicken wings, calamari, French fries and sweet potato fries as appetizers.   The wings and calamari are very good.  I had the king crab legs by the pound with the super spicy sauce.  I enjoyed it thoroughly but I did not feel the sauce is spicy at all (p.s. I have very high tolerance to spices).  My coworkers had a couple of margaritas but claimed that the drinks were not the best. The waitress was very accommodating and made them new drinks voluntarily.  I do not drink, so the my review of the place is not affected but the quality of their drinks.  I would dine here again.",

The staff were friendly and provided excellent service. This list of draft and bottled beers was amazing. We ordered a fried calamari appetizer to share. It was delivered to the table in a basket. It was hot, very well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. We shared the steamed seafood combo with 1 whole lobster, snow crab clusters and head on shrimp. It was cooked in medium hot sauce. The seafood was all amazingly fresh and cooked to perfection. It was a great experience and we will be returning soon.",

The seafood was fresh and their twist sauce was great. It\u2019s just like any other boil where you can pick you sauce and how spicy you want it. I opted for a mild spice and it was good enough for me. They also bring you utensils for the crab legs which makes life so much easier. To start they bring you out garlic bread (which was delicious) and we order calamari as an appetizer. All the food came out quick! And the servers were attentive. They only have beer but they may be byob (id call and confirm). Otherwise they had sodas and water to offer. I will be returning any time I\u2019m in Brooklyn!",
