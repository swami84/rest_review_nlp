This stuff tastes just like the food I had in Chengdu...it\u2019s sour, sweet, salty, smokey, garlicky, spicy, umami goodness, and when I say spicy I mean OH SO spicy. I got the extra spicy option for everything and they do not dumb the spice down; it had me in tears (in a good way) and was on par with the spice levels of everything I had in Sichuan. I got the douhua, zhou dumplings, and tianshuimian and was blown away by everything. You can really taste the spices like star anise and Sichuan peppercorn in their chili oil and it tastes so fresh, not old and stale like the chili oil I\u2019ve had at some other places. To top it off, it\u2019s super affordable and the packaging was incredibly cute and well designed - every single container was branded and they even gave me a complimentary KN95 mask with my order which made the take out experience feel so much more special during these times. Do not miss out on this place, they are truly a hidden gem in this city.",
