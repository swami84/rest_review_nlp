I was waiting on by a very friendly bartender. We chatted away while I waited for my sandwiches.  I talked about how I look forward to going there now that you can eat either inside or now that it's getting warmer and we can eat outside.  We ate our falafel sandwiches in the car because we were in a rush. It was quite good. We love the french fries. They are the kind that are battered and fried. I made sure to grab them out of the packaging right away so they were nice and crisp. My mother was more sensible and had her falafel sandwich with a salad and she said that was quite good too.  Looking forward to trying more of the menu of that the bartender was encouraging me to have!",

I had the best Mediterranean food AND dessert(the picture speaks for itself). I\u2019m Extremely pleased by the courtesy demonstrated by the owner and staff. You can see they\u2019re passionated about what they do and it makes the difference. Nice ambience and the prices are extremely reasonable compared to similar places in the Brooklyn area.. Another gem of a restaurant in the big Apple. I highly recommend Mazzat. Thanks. You guys the best!",

I never saw more than a few people in there so it couldn't be very good, right?  What I didn't understand was that Mazzat has such a loyal following in the neighborhood that most of its business was delivery.  My favorite middle eastern food in the city is at Tanoreen in Bay Ridge. It's also rated by NY Mag as the #1 middle eastern restaurant in NYC.  Well, Mazzat comes very close and, in fact, surpasses it with some of its dishes.  Their hummus is the best I've had anywhere. Their rice is addictive.  I love their mixed grilled platter.  Bacon-wrapped dates, sujuk, baba ganoush, tabouili... all first rate.  Robby and Jimmy, the owners, are affable guys, eager to please.  It also has a large, well-stocked bar and is a popular place for world cup viewing.",

It was served with fresh pita bread, a salad, and Egyptian rice - which is absolutely amazing. I almost went with the pilaf, and am so glad I did not. Can't wait to try this one in person - I read they have great buys on wine.",
