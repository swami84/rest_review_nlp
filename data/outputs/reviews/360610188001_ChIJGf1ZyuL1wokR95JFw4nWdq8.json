Huge chunks of strawberry and basil leaves made this the perfect thirst quencher for a warm Summer night.  Now, for the food.... from the perfectly selected cheese and crackers onto the salad, salmon, shrimp and fillet.. the food was cooked perfectly and the presentation simply stellar.  Concluding the meal was the a selection of the world famous pudgies. I wish I could say I had a favorite, and at this point my favorite is the coconut, but had you had asked me a few months ago I would have said the banana pudding. Everything was just so good I cant pick just one thing I would rave about... hence the reason I am at a loss for words.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you have never stopped in or ordered from Evelyn's kitchen. Although there is no formal seating, there is a chefs table that can be booked in advance and there is always catering and the dependable \"to-go\" or delivery option. Bottom line, whatever your dietary restrictions Ayala and her crew aim to please and accommodate... so there is NO EXCUSE to miss out on this hidden gem of Harlem.",

We had them provide catered meals multiple times over a 2 week period for groups ranging from 30-200 people, including crew, cast and talent. Everyone was impressed.  From the moment they arrived on set and walked in with the food (in warmers, toasty and ready to serve) and accessories to set-up, we knew we would be well cared for. They thought of everything, even bringing their own water to fill the trays! Some of our favorites were the chicken wings, sausage and peppers, broccoli and ALL of the desserts. They were also very flexible and made sure to provide options for those that were vegetarian, vegan and gluten free. They were super flexible and willing to work with us in any way to make the whole catering process a joy.  Catering for a cast and crew of nearly 200 people is always a challenge. Usually someone has something to complain about. But with Evelyn\u2019s all I heard was praise for a wonderful meal, and that is worth every penny. We will definitely be using them on future productions, and I\u2019m already looking forward to next time when we get to have more of the amazing banana cookies they make!",

Rules are rules but the delivery guy had no problem, it was supposedly the owner's call on this one.  So I ended up placing a whole new order online with a fake address and just met the guy.  when you have a friend who's pregnant in the house and a craving hits, you just gotta make it happen. but I won't be giving evelyn's place any more of MY money.
