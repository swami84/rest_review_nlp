The  plates are very cheap , the food was very very disappointing. I thought it was supposed to be a Saint Lucia place but it\u2019s more Jamaican inspired. I feel that there is allot of work that needs to be put on the menu. Here is a suggestion. Have dasheeen, yam, green banana, green fig salad, bakes (not that hard dough stuff) we need a proper Lucian menu.",

Most Caribbean  restaurants give more rice and less meat but I got less rice literally 2scoops of rice  and even less meat when I brought it home I was shocked being that my fellow peers hyped this restaurant up on social media. It might be because the servers didn\u2019t know me  I\u2019m guessing but then that\u2019s favoritism  I don\u2019t know but my food was little. Apart from that the food is descent enough. But I wouldn\u2019t take that 30 minute drive to go there being that the quantity isn\u2019t up to par.",
