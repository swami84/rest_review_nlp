There was rude customer service over the phone although the manager was apologetic. When i got there i waited over 30 minutes for my food even though it was ordered 20 minutes prior to me getting there. I observed the cashier being rude again.  The back staff although nice was unorganized which i think accounted for the long wait. The seem to keep forgetting orders. I clearly wasnt the only customer waiting for a while which was confusing because food was constantly coming up. There was also a concern that none of the kitchen staff wore gloves. I saw cooks wipe their brow or head several times and it didnt look like they washed their hands but because of the counter i couldnt be sure. The only reason i gave 3 stars is because the food was still ok. It wasn't as good as my first experience. But it was still good. Also i didnt qualify for the special price by ordering online. I paid 22.99 for a crab and shrimp combo when is was priced at 15.99 in store. You cant order over the phone is what I was told. Only online or instore. Overall i was disappointed and felt i could have saved $40",

I believe the manager or owner interacted with me and my friend, he was very nice! Food was good. They give you enough food for one person, I had the shrimp potatoes and crab legs for a decent price. I added sausages in for an extra buck. The only thing I would say is, my food was good but a little salty but I think that's cause I added too many flavors. I had garlic butter and cajun seasoning, next time I'll tell them to go easy on the seasoning they sprinkle on top. Other than that, good food!",
