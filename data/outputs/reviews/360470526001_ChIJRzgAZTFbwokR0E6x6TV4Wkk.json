What could better convey the transitional period of the neighborhood?  (Mimi's Humus perhaps?)  There is some good food here but it is most definitely double $$, pushing on $$$ dollar sign.  It use to be cash only and there is still an ATM on-site.  The coffee-obsessed barista has both soy and almond milk for that expresso or Caff\u00e8 Americano (god forbid you call it anything else).  Portions are small so be warned if you think this could be a suitable spot for a hearty dinner.  I've had a few different dishes here plus coffee, tea, hot coco and some pastries.  The humus plate and chipotle egg dishes are tasty and the coffee is very good (though I am not picky about my hot bean water).  The pastries are good too, although expensive.  Outdoor seating is an added bonus and service usually runs between a little slow and kinda fast.  If you prefer a less yuppie coffee stop you can always head to the Connecticut Muffin just three doors down or Catskill Bagel only a few blocks East.",

The man working upfront told me it would take 5 min. After waiting 15 min, it was still not ready and the cook had not even begun my order. I had to leave with out food or a refund. So i went to work late and with no food. This man was very unemphatic and unkind, wish i had the girl serve me as she is much nicer and fast. This seems to be a common issue based on the negative reviews here. Transparency is more important to the customer rather than false timelines.",

So I get my latte go sit back down and a few minutes later I walk back to the counter to order an eggs Benedict which had little to no flavor whatsoever. At the end of my meal I bring my cup up to the front cause why not help out. As I'm trying to hand him (to the same guy with an attitude from before) the cup he says the bus box is under that fridge over there. Apparently I was out of line for expecting the person who works there to put my cup in there himself, I should have have known that I had to go behind the counter, reach down under a fridge and place my cup in a box( sarcasm). I love the atmosphere of this place but they really need to do something about their customer service.",

On a weekday morning pretty much every table was occupied by laptop-glued patrons basically camping out, so getting a table was difficult, even though nearly all tables had only one person at it. Overall, prefer Madeline's down the block, though prices here are better (read: Madeline's is more overpriced.)",

(It makes me rage... )  I have a love hate relationship with the food. Some dishes are truly sexy, comforting and hearty while others are super meh, bland and you know, nothing to write home about. Like this morning, my Mediterranean eggs with Zaatar were delicious but my friends egg dish had frozen portobello mushrooms. (As if they forgot to defrost it and just dumped it on the plate) who does that?  They do have outdoor seating which is awesome when the weather is nice. And the price to portion ratio is perfect.  So yes Qathra. I hate you, then I love you. Then I love you, then I hate you.",
