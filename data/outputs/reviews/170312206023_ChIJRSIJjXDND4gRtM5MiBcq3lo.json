It took me 2 years to try Choi's, even though I live around the corner. It just doesn't look like much.  The portions are huge, the food quality is very high, and the prices are low. It won't win any awards for complexity, but if you want to pay $15 for enough tasty standard Chinese fare to last you 2 days, this place is fantastic. Big soft pot-stickers and crispy Crab Rangoon, great curry, kung pao and cashew chicken. Dishes are full of veggies and nuts. Hit's the spot. Definitely order takeout or delivery because the ambiance is non-existant.",
