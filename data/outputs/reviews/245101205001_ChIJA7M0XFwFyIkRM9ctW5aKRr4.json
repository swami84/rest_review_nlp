Now I'm sure this sounds cheesy, but the stepping through Orto's doors really made me feel like I was transported out of the US (or at least out of Maryland). Maybe its the lack of traveling I have done due to the pandemic, or maybe its just a magical place... I guess you'll have to see for yourself!  My partner and I started dinner off with the arancini. These perfectly fried risotto balls were complex in flavor, and yet light at the same time. The fennel sauce and tomatoes that were paired with it created a light and cleansing element which made this risotto dish very balanced.  For my main course, I had the Charred Broccolini Orecchiette. The charred broccolini made this dish smoky while the poached golden raisins delivered surprising pops of sweetness to this already clever dish. I have to say this tops my list of all time favorite pasta dishes!  Unfortunately, we were not able to save room for dessert! Next time I go to Orto, I will be ordering the Lemon Pistachio Cake though. I cannot even try and recall the number of them I watched come out of the kitchen.  Overall this restaurant gets a 5/5. The food was unbeatable, the ambiance was magical, the music was always on point, and the service was stellar! Some may say it is pricey, but you can taste the quality in the ingredients that they use. Although it is not a place I can afford to each at often, I will be coming back as soon as I can!",

There is a small parking lot directly across the street from the entrance which accepts cash payment only. You can also try for street parking out front, but need luck on your side. We started with the burrata and it was light and tasty, but it didn\u2019t wow me. The Orto Caesar should not be understated. It\u2019s a good option to get started with if you plan on having dessert. I ordered a pasta dish featuring lasagna-type noodles with curls on the ends and different kinds of mushrooms, but I found the dish to be a bit dry and it would have benefited from more sauce or cheese or both. The cheesecake was very rich and tasty, but the Zeppole won my heart, for sure!! The red wine selection was also impressive and hit the mark. I will try the Bronzino on the menu next time, which cake recommended by our server and is a personal favorite.",

The olives were over seasoned with tarragon (?), tasting of anise more than olives. The eggplant with burrata - the eggplant was burnt to a crisp. The pasta dish was dry, as if it had been sitting around, then reheated under a salamander. I won't be going back.",

The ambiance and decor are spot on, the lighting is low and romantic. The art and furniture have a certain maturity. The prices are reasonable but not cheap, and they wouldn't be for this type of experience, making it a reasonable value. The food is delicious and well presented. The portions are solid and leave just enough space for dessert. They have an awesome snack menu that includes olives and almonds, two of my favorites. The desserts are well worth it, too. The area is very lively on a Saturday night, outdoor seating allowing you to enjoy the energy of the street. If you're looking for a trendy Italian dining experience, Orto will not disappoint. I reccomend the grilled skirt steak.  Traveler and Adventurer - IG @brian.dent",

We had the burrata, some small plates, 3 pastas, all different yet equally delicious, the spring pea agnolotti my favorite.

None of us knew what to expect because this was our first time at Orto. However, as enthusiasts of Italian food, we were so pleased with our choices! Between the three of us, we ordered the butternut squash agnolotti, pomodoro e ravioli, and rigatoni 'alla norma, all of which were divine! Our only complaint was that the portions were small, but we made sure to savor every bite. Afterwards, we ordered coffee and a hazelnut cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which were also exquisite. The service and ambiance of the restaurant were also wonderful.  This restaurant was a bit out of my usual price range, but it was so worth it! I can't wait to come back soon, although I think that I would struggle to choose between all the amazing options!",

Loved the interesting appetizers (conserves) olives with preserved lemon and marinated mushroom also the burata flatbread was so good we ordered two, it was super fresh and had this really tasty sweat onion jam. Some really nice pastas and the best was an agnolotti butternut squash stuffed pasta with Madeira and sage. Lastly we all agreed that the dessert was the best we have ever had at an Italian restaurant... the Italian donuts (zeppelini) and the most wonderful blood orange brown butter tart made us wish we had ordered a second round to have the next day! Definitely will be back, great addition to the neighborhood!",

The service was outstanding and I was thrilled I could still get the magical blood orange tart I had loved at Bottega. Everything we ordered was delicious, but I felt that the portion size was a little small for the price. It\u2019s hard not to draw comparisons to Bottega since so much is the same, and while we had a lovely meal and spent $125 on it, we left a bit hungry.
