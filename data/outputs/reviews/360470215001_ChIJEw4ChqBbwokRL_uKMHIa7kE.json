I was charged for  a drink that \" the bartender made by mistake\" according to our waitress so why were we charged 22$ for that as well as why was I not able to see my bill and see that gratuity  was already  included before I added extra gratuity.  Very shady. Def  will not be back.....an extra 45$ for no reason  and the food was not that great. I do have to say that the waitress was very sweet and helpful.   And I'm sure the bill was not her fault as it came from the bar.....she def should have checked it to make sure that mistake  drink was not included as well as let the patron  see their bill before making a final charge....",

I love the open concept with such a small place. We went last night and it was like 75 degrees out. The windows were wide open, lights were dim, candles were burning. Just beautiful. Great vibe.  The food... The BEST fish and chips I ever had. Drinks were strong, bartenders were attentive and friendly.  My only issue was the bartender telling us that there was 20 min left of happy hour.. then hands us a drink menu so we assume it's the happy hour menu... It wasn't.. we spent about $96 dollars on 4 drinks and two entrees (they include 20% gratituity off top). I also asked the bartender what drinks she would recommend she suggested I go with specialty drinks (again assuming I'm looking at happy hour menu) so I ordered specialty drinks which made the bill and the 20% tip higher in the end. I felt played a little I won't lie lol.  I would go again but ask for clarification next time.",

About 20 mins into us being there the waiter finally comes over to take our drink orders. Before we get our drinks the manager comes over to us and ask us to switch tables because they had a party of four coming in (which never showed) and they needed to accommodate them. Ok, we  were sitting in the front at the tables in the middle and was moved to the corner. Not a problem,  however at this point we\u2019re still waiting for our drinks to come. Now we finally get our drinks and place our food order they brought most of what we ordered but forgot my dates shrimp and told us it would take 30-40 mins before they could bring him an order. So we opted not to get that order and ordered another round of drinks which we never got. We asked for the check and saw that the gratuity was tacked on the bill already. Now why should I (my date) pay for a service that was horrible.  He asked to speak to the manager who came over and was nice at first until she found out why she was being called to our table. She did take the check and took the gratuity off however, when she brought the check back she threw it on the table as if we caused her an inconvenience. Very unprofessional,  I would not go back to this establishment.",

The service was good, the atmosphere was nice, the food was good.  I had the catfish, just felt like it wasn't enough. (that's y I'm giving it 4 stars). Ordered a pineapple bomb and it was the bomb, (which is y I dont remember what my husband had) but he enjoyed his food. They play a variety of music. Space is kind of small, but I would definitely go back.",

        "caption": "I visited this lounge on Tuesday June, 5th. I live a few blocks down from this location. I had been there 1 night previously just before they closed for the evening.. my friend and I sat at the bar ordered some very poorly tasting mixed drinks.  Seeing that we were practically the last patrons for the evening we summed up that probably the barman was a bit tired.  Anyway I decided to return again and that WAS A HUGE MISTAK E   Now if you are familiar with the area you know that we had a choice of restaurants and bars, but instead decided to patronize a probably black owned and run location.  Now before anyone gets hot under the color I too am black.  I try to support my race any chance I get.  We sat down nearest the door.  Now it seemed as though this was their comedy night.. we did not know this,  We ordered food and drinks and proceeded to have a conversation.. something everyone else in the room was doing.. the show started.. we were not interested in it so we continued or conversation, only to be told by a gentleman standing next to us that a show was going on and that we should keep down our voices.  Now this is just my male friend and I, not shouting or laughing out loud... but just having a conversation,  I told him this is a bar and thats what people in a bar do.. talk.  I felt very much offended so I decided to leave to go elsewhere... I went over to the bar to cancel the order and pay for the two drinks.  the girl who took our order said the food was already being made... I did not care. A woman walked over to our table and asked what the problem was.. I told her.. she agreed with the Man that they could hear our voices over the man on the mike??? What???? impossible.. we paid the tab and left... when we were almost down the block she came out shouting at us asking if we did not want the 8 bucks we left as a tip... cause our money was not wanted there??? What??? that is why some of us black folks would rather NOT patronize these venues... they do not know what customer service is!!! I would NEVER set foot in this establishment again.  The management sucks!!! Customer service NON-existent.",
