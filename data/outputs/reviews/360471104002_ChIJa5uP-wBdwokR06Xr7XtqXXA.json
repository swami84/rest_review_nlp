In the age of pandemic where safety, speed and cleanliness are paramount--I appreciated being able to order online and have contactless/curbside pickup--about 40 minutes from order click to first bite (on busy Valentine's Day).  On Stanley Avenue, curbside could be a little tricky so make sure to time your pickup with care and caution!   As for the kind of food--this is a treat to me and my family so I wouldn't order this stuff just any old day but only for special occasions and I will definitely order from them again!",

Going to try everything on the menu -- burrito bowl, nachos, quesadillas,  tacos, empanadas -- yumm!! GREAT alternative to the fast food, Chinese food, etc in the area. Food tastes clean, fresh, and not greasy. I asked for no guac and they still included it, so that's why 4 stars not 5.",

        "caption": "One day passing through Brooklyn with my boyfriend, we decided to stop here and get something to eat. We saw the menu and it looked so good we couldn\u2019t wait to eat. It was about a 30 minute wait because they were making the food fresh. When we received the food and began to eat in the car, it was TERRIBLE! My boyfriend had chicken empanadas and they were sooo greasy and the texture was unlike any empanada I\u2019ve ever seen or tasted. We also ordered loaded nachos to share which were COLD!! We ate the food as soon as it came out so we were confused to taste Lukewarm/ cold nachos with cheese and meat on it. Lastly, I ordered 3 tacos for $12 which was a great deal. I ordered shrimp , beef and a pork taco and was disappointed again:  the shrimp taco tasted like artificial shrimp and the beef was flavorless and greasy. The ONLY thing that was great to me was the pork taco: it was tasty and prepared well. This food didn\u2019t taste that fresh at all for such a long wait to receive our \u201cfreshly\u201d prepared food. I was highly upset and disappointed especially since this was my first meal of the day and I spent so much money in total for our food. I will never come back again. Sorry, but I do not recommend coming here to eat. I only got a picture of my tacos which is why there is only 1 picture.",
