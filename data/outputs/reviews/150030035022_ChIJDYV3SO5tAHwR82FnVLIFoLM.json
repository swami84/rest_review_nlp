I called to ask what was going on there since I used to order a lot but haven't in the last few months. I had the 'pleasure' of speaking with the owner who was extremely rude and not apologetic at all. He spoke over me when I was trying to explain what the issue was and then hung up on me.  Do not order from this place, their service and quality has gone way downhill and does not reflect their current rating!! I wish I could give half a star.",

        "caption": "This is the pizza place formly known as Magoo's Pizza. Used to be a fantastic place to order a quality pizza. While a little pricy they had a special of 18.99 for there large pizza which didn't hurt the wallet too bad. Unfortunately,  changing places means they have changed their prices. Now a pizza will run you about 33.95 for a large or so. They no longer seemed interested in providing the same service they once did. They are great, but there are far better pizzas on the island for that price.",
