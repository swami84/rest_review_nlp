It was a pre-fixe menu so I\u2019m not sure why there was such a delay. We literally had to flag staff walking by for assistance. The table next to us waited almost 50 mins between starter and entree until I said something to the staff.  They seated us in the outside of the restaurant in the transition area from lobby to restaurant. The area is surrounded by glass and leads to outside. First off, since I made reservations at a upscale place this is not where I expect to be seated. Second, no heaters really!?!  Overall I\u2019m sure this place is delightful. Just not on Valentine\u2019s Night.",

My daughter (6) and I are in town for the weekend and I had requested in our reservation that they call her \"madam\" (she thinks that is a sign of \"fanciness\"); they went above and beyond. From our entry, the staff was so attentive and kept \"deferring\" to her for choices. They provided her with table service of a bottle of sparkling cider (after checking with me), complimented her continually, and generally made her feel like (in her words) \"an elegant lady\". The smile on her face during dinner is one I will never forget, and I will be forever grateful for the wonderful memories they've helped to make. You have earned a loyal customer in Mom, and a definite future customer in daughter. AMAZING SERVICE!",

While the servers tried and were mostly friendly, it's the organization and management of the place that threw the whole thing in disarray.  Most of the platters of food did not have any serving silverware -- maybe they were never placed there or they went missing.  There were two bowls with butter, but no knife or any utensil to scoop it out.  Hot food got done and were not replaced promptly.  All the jams went missing and were never replaced during my entire hour there.  Food quality was not exactly stellar either.  I came here for dinner many times before previously and was generally very happy.  But this breakfast experience really did it.
