I decided to order again the next day, i told the young lady about my previous order so i had her repeat my order twice to make sure this doesnt happen again. When i received my sandwich this time low and behold they screwed it up again nothing could be done at that time because it i ordered well aftet 9pm & they close at 10pm. I called & told the driver about the screw up because they wasn't answering the phone after 10 he put the manager on the phone and he told me to save my receipt and they will send me a new sandwich the next day. I called the next day & politely told them about both screw ups and they was unbelievably rude & unprofessional. I was out of $18 $9 a peice for both sandwiches. They hung up the phone on me twice refused to give me their names so that i can report them. This is how they treat loyal customers! I love jimmy johns but I will never order from this location. I had to go to bed hungry both nights after i paid my hard earned money & to top it off im a patient in the hospital.",

My father who is 71 years old and suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease and is an insulin dependent Diabetic  came to this particular restaurant. He explained to one of the managers that he was not feeling well. He asked if he could sit down to gather himself in order to call my brother. He was denied a seat. Both \u201cmanagers were rude to him\u201d.  He had asked the \u201cmanagers\u201d why were they treating him like the guys from Starbucks? After hearing this I was upset.  I called the establishment and asked for the manager. I asked the gentleman what was the policy regarding allowing individuals to  come into their establishment to have a seat. The man hung up the phone. I called back. I asked to speak with the Manager again, this time he was reluctant to tell me. He then Asked for my name and I told him. He said that his name was Bryan (and I\u2019m not really sure if it was). I asked him did he hang up on me? He denied it. I asked \u201cBryan\u201d again what was the policy regarding people not patronizing their business and requesting a seat. I was told that they ask those individuals to leave. I spoke to him and I asked him did he remember my father who came in. My father is 6\u20198, i\u2019m Sure not too many elderly tall men could be forgotten about. I had explained to him that my father stated to the other gentleman that he wasn\u2019t feeling well. I asked him not to treat anyone else like that because you never know what people are going through. He did apologize. However, I am not sure if my words truly carried. As a human being, he should\u2019ve had way more respect for my father than that. I cannot image telling someone who is elderly stating they had Parkinson\u2019s and being able to visibly it, saying NO. I will never again support a business like Jimmy Johns. What I will do is support the Brown Hotel across the street. My father was able to make it across the street to that hotel and asked one of the Bell serviceman for help. He explained that he needed help calling my brother because his hands were shaking really bad and he didn\u2019t feel well. So you know what the gentleman did? He treated my father like a HUMAN BEING!!!! He offered my father a glass of water and ginger ale. He helped my father call my brother for help. My father cried while telling me this. He thanks God that someone saw him and helped him. He felt hurt and humiliated by the people at Jimmy Johns. To the man that helped my father thank you soooooo much. To Jimmy Johns. I\u2019m still debating on calling the news about how you discriminated against my father. All he needed was help. Chasing a dollar should not mean more than helping your fellow man. Shame on you.",

However because of how they handled the one time we did have a problem is the reason for this low rating. We ordered 2 sandwiches and only one was delivered. I called the store and told that I was wrong and two were delivered. After speaking to the manager I was told the missing sandwich would be made and sent out right away. After 30mins, we still had not received the missing sandwich. I called a 2nd time and was told it was on the way. We finally received the missing sandwich 45mins after the first one was delivered. And we were offered nothing in way of an apology or gift card for their mistake. My fiance was on his lunch break and ended up not being able to eat because from the time I originally placed the order to when he got his missing sandwich it was over an hour later.",

After entering the store, not ONE person greeted me or even asked \"May I help you?\" All the employees continued making sandwiches and talking to each other. The manager was busy laughing and talking to another employee! I stood at the counter for over EIGHT minutes. Still no greeting!  An employee came up to the cash register, and evidently it must have been down, even she didn't offer to ask what I wanted to order. She called the manager over and he took about FIVE minutes to fix the registers (turning them off and back on), then walked away and stirred out the window. He did not say \"Sir, sorry for the issues\" or \"How can I help you\" or \"Sorry for your wait.\" I walked out! I will never go back!!! Horrible customer service, poor management and unprofessional employees!!! I asked for the General Manager's name, and that's when an employee answered. I hope the General Manager (Mike) read this review. I would like to talk to you. But regardless, I WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!!! Just review the camera. I stood there for over 15 minutes, before walking out.",

Also wouldn't it possibly be better to have people deliver your customers food that are clean and presentable, these drivers represent your business.
