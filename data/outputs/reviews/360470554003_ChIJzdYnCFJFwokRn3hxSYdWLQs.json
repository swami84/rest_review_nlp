Food is still very good, only minor complaint was the rice was a bit too hard. Otherwise everything was overall really good.  4.5 stars would be a better score indication. Would recommend!\u00b0  Previous review below: 3 stars.  Posting again since this review doesnt seem to show up for other people. Positives: Food is good. Friendly staff.  Negatives: It's complete chaos, no one approached at first, had to ask for help. Constantly bumped by passing people due to lack of space. Took a while to get our check even after asking.  The staff tries, but there are just too many people in such a small place. Once the place gets a little less hectic, maybe a month or 2 from now, I would definitely go back.",

It came off the grill dripping but it felt dry after a couple of bites. The people with me ordered lamb shawarma, which is said to be the best thing there (although some argue for the baby chicken shawarma) and they were also a little unimpressed. The shawarma was also apparently a little dry. Then they got beef sliders, medium well, and those came out similar to my burger. So overall, the food tastes good. Just a little dry. Maybe they were expecting us to put sauce on our food?",

I have several food allergies and made that distinctly clear to the waitress. All their salads are laced with either vinegar, sugar or other unnecessary spices. There are NO other options. That\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. They serve the sandwich with French fries. Extremely unhealthy options and food and your forced to pay the full (overpriced) amount. A helpful solution: offer the sandwiches on their own. You cannot force unhealthy food down people\u2019s throats; that\u2019s what it felt like and to boot I was criticized for it. It\u2019s a matter of time before this poorly run establishment shuts down. Never will walk back in there! Never!",

We were there yesterday with 2 friends and we ordered 4 entrees  2 of them came after about  15 minutes And the other  2 we had to ask twice where they were they did not show up for 40 minutes later. The excuse was for some reason  the order did not go in. Since they only open up about 3 weeks ago and the place was jammed , with absolutely no room to move, I can see where they cannot yet figure out how to handle a crowd and are getting stuck. The food was very tasty The lafa bread is out of this world Great The salad bar  Is good , However I don't understand that when you order a $25 dish that they use mushrooms out of a can which tasted like they were heated up in the water that came in the can. As I said I am giving them 5 stars since I know they will improve with time and  Our experience was a good one. I must also say that the wait staff tried their best to serve people even though they have almost no Room to move. I look forward to going there again but I will give it a few weeks.",
