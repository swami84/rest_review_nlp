I ordered a medium sized Curry goat with white rice, cabbage, and plantains. I also got a piece of Jerk Chicken on the side. The total came up to $18. I'm really upset because the medium sized plate was small and he gave me way more rice than Curry goat. The rice covered more than half of the plate!! (Look at the picture)The plantains were burnt and nasty. But I can say the jerk chicken and the curry goat were good but other than that I'm very disappointed. I used to come here a lot but after today I won't be back for a while.",

It\u2019s a community business with decent food  and I try my best to take into consideration many things. But after two prior unsatisfying occurrences I decided this time to alert others before their spending hard earned money. I found hair today in my order of oxtail rice and cabbage. It was a long noticeable strand of hair in my food. When I called the Resturant a woman who said she was the \u201cmanager\u201d decided to handle the situation. As a manager her conduct first was unprofessional. I was told to take a picture of the hair, ok. but when I tried to explain in the picture you couldn\u2019t see this strand in the food Ill put it on a napkin she became irritable. She felt I should bring the food to them. But what would have been the point of delivery? She said this never happened before and  deemed it proper  to hang up on me.  I called back to get a refund she and my number was blocked. I had ordered more food with this order and at this point was turned off from all. All who order out knows it can be pricey especially when for a family.I am big on customer service in any industry. As a customer who considers people, who tips, and who worked with this Restaurant;  I think other hard working businesses deserves my money. Good luck to all that consider. I really hope your experiences are better than mine.",

The jerk chicken is spectacular, but the oxtail and the brown stew are also excellent. BBQ chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was special. Next time I might have them put the jerk sauce on the chicken, and see how that works out.  Each plate comes with 2 or 3 sides. I usually get mac & cheese, cabbage, and plantains, which are all really good.  I usually get a ginger infused sorrel juice with my meal. It's a terrific compliment.  The family/staff is really kind and friendly, and there's a good vibe in this nice family restaurant.",
