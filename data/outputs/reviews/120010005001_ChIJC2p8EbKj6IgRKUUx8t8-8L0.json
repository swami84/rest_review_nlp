The cocktails are not overly adventurous, but they are put together with class and care. Great for a traditional drink, think Old Fashioned, Tom Collins, Moscow Mule, Mai Tai, that sort of thing.

Dont call that tzatziki, it's dill flavored mayonnaise drowning a flavorless veggie patty.

A great location for late-night food, including a bucket of fried chicken, which is amazing. The drinks are on the more expensive side but they're well made and fairly priced in my opinion.",
