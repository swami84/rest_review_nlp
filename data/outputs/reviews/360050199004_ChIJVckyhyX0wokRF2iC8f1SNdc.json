Sorry to have to give such a review because I've been shopping there for at least 30 yrs.& have always had a great experience & I know Manny Jordon Jason & Brian who are all great guys. They've always contributed to our community so kudos to them but your staff leaves a bad feeling among some of us & it's not all staff.",

There's this one guy who tries to act cool and flirt with the girls wearing his hat to the side in a angle while you are waiting to be called. Just when you tell him something now he has to do something all of Sudden. Not only that they take their sweet time cutting cold cuts. One morning I waited 15 mins just to place a beacon egg sandwich. While there was only one person in front of me and it wasnt busy. Need more employees in there. I have to admit this fine fare is pretty clean. Please just have a sale price list on the buffet in stead of weighing the food. One time I put mangu with onions and salami something that cost 5 the max 6 dollars was $9.75 I left the food behind and went up the block.  P.s please order a lot of low sodium cold cuts. Not everybody can  have alot of sodium in their body. Such as low sodium balongi, turkey, ham, cheese. Everytime I ask deli manager and he tells me we don't order it cuz it doesn't sell here in this neighborhood and I have to drive all the way to stop and shop in yonkers for my uncle to get his cold cuts. Nice people but have very bad habits. But is a very clean supermarket. And with the best fruits and veggies.",

I bought some fish fillets that were more skin and bones than meat. The fish also had a weird smell I couldn't identify.  I have bought fillets from Food Bazaar that are better in every way. I would love to shop in my neighborhood but the quality of the seafood keeps me away.",
