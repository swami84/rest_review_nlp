Jamon croquettes were alright, perhaps a bit bland.  Crab ceasar salad was a very delicious and unique offering, though know that the \"old bay chips\" are literally chips, like ruffles. It took some getting used to...  Lobster ravioli was OK. The ravioli itself was very good, though didn't get many with the meal. The sauce was very lemony and acidic, but still overall a good dish.  The espresso martini was fantastic. The doughnuts were tasty, not overwhelmingly sweet.  All in all, the food was good and the experience was great, will definitely return to try some other dishes.",

The burrata was one-note and overly sweet, I would recommend adding some nuts or seeds to add textural variety. The panzanella was genuinely good - I enjoyed the combination of flavors between the vinaigrette and pickled onions. The short rib was tender, though it needed more flavor. The cheesecake was okay but, again, fairly unremarkable.  Overall, another classic example of a Chicago New American restaurant which is fine but does not impress.",

I called to move our reservation inside as the forecast was not looking good for later that evening and the staff was very accommodating. Turned out to be a good move as it rained for the firat half hour plus that we were there. The menu is accessed via QR code and the tables were sufficiently distanced.  The menu is somewhat upscale but the burger at the table next to us looked fantastic so those looking for simpler fare should be well served.  All-in-all a very nice dinner and I would happily recommend you give it a try.",

It came with sides of potatoes and brussel sprouts. The potatoes were really good, brussel sprouts were the only thing I didn't really care for. They had crushed peanut on them, which I thought was unusual and I was very interested in trying it out, but....meh. Felt like it stuck to the roof of my mouth (but please do not add jelly!).  And maybe not a big deal, but I found the way the menu was written to be annoyingly pretentious. Why write pommes pure when you can write whipped or mashed potatoes? Maybe they're going for fancy, but it's obnoxious and inaccessible.",

A little noisy, but a good place for a date. Everything on the menu looked good, but we were in the mood for burgers, so that\u2019s what we ordered along with beer, cocktails, and a salad. I felt a little funny ordering burgers at an upscale restaurant, but they were exceptional. Double patty, American cheese and dijonnaise on a brioche bun with fries. The salad and cocktails were great as well. We had to order the burgers again on our next visit. So good.",

Every thinly sliced beef is coated with olive oil, pepper and pecorino. The arugula green and shaved egg yolk complements its rich taste profile. The rainbow trout is also another winner.

        "caption": "We were walking in the neighborhood on a Saturday evening after a play at the nearby theater and decided to give The Willow Room a shot. The hostesses greeted us in a very friendly manner and almost immediately had us a nice table in the window. The restaurant is well done in a visual sense, airy, old brick, lots of well placed and interesting art. There is also a dining room in the basement that I checked put and would certainly be a nice cozy spot for a romantic dinner date. Then...it went all wrong. We were given menus and water but no server addressed us for over 10 mins. Suddenly a food runner appears with an order of Burrata and sets it down and walks away. My wife tried to call someone over and they ignored us. So she began eating it, it was her birthday and we were hungry travelers. It was a great Burrata. A server comes to the table with a harried look about her and asks \"did you order this?\" My wife says, \"nope, but it is really delicious and just put it on our bill\". The server says nothing more and walks away. The runner appears at the neighboring table with another order of Burrata and another appetizer, the couple says they didn't order the Burrata but did the other. We looked at one another and knew something was not going well here. Finally our server comes, introduces herself and asks if we want to order. 25mins after seating. We order: soup and the trout special for my wife. I am out of sorts at this point, little sounds good so I order the shrimp/crab cocktail appetizer and a cheeseburger/fries that sounds like tasty and easy out. Fortunately, my wife is enjoying her wine and Burrata, the place has good energy from the patrons. Our server doesn't reappear for ages, the runner and another server top off my water and check on my lady's wine. L's soup appetizer arrives....as does my dinner. Server finally appeared again \"I am soo sorry...I uh...didn't understand...I am not sure why this came out this way...do you want me to hold this for you?\" um no. I will just eat it now and have my appetizer for dinner. She walks away befuddled and my wife and I are as well. Burger and fries are tasty, lots of fries, good bun, little bit light anf thin patties but they were delicious. L likes her beet soup very much. The trout dinner shows up. It is a very handsome and fragrant plate, a generous filet of trout. L is delighted. I am slowly eating so I don't out pace her. Server swings by if all was okay. I said yes, good food and whenever the kitchen has my appetizer done I will take it. (we hadn't eaten since 930am and had walked all day) We finish what we have and wait. Server asks if we want to see a dessert menu, we do just for kicks. We don't see anything too interesting at this point so we pass. Server floats off. 10 mins later returns with our check. No charge for the mistaken Burrata nor my never seen or heard from again appetizer I had ordered. We are just as confused as our server seems to be. If the restaurant had been a madhouse I would have understood a kitchen mistake, but even the couple behind us, who had started long before us, were just receiving their dinners. It had such good potential: comfy, pretty and a little sexy atmosphere. Nice tight menu with good options for dinner or even just sharing with friends. I hope it was just an off night for our server or the kitchen cause it is well positioned to be a great upscale neighborhood place.",

We were sat immediately upon arrival and within seconds our server....a charming little guy....greeted us and offered to decant the bottle of wine we had brought in. He even commented on the vintage (05 Burgundy...Mmmm)! We then asked for recommendations on apps and entrees as we hadn't been here before and were blown away by his selections. Personally I can't say EVERYTHING on the menu is great, but the Meatballs, Mussels, Cauliflower salad and Trout were all spot on!! In between courses an Italian looking gentleman (i assume manager?) stopped by our table and inquired about dinner and mentioned that the next time we came in we needed to try some of the impressive selections they have on the reserve list. A request i rarely agree to but in this case...why not??? After dinner we adjourned to the bar for a cocktail and my wife immediately took to the bartender! \"Murph\" as he calls himself was hilarious and a veritable encyclopedia of information on Bourbon!! Before we knew it it was past midnight and we had to get home to the kids, but if you're in Lincoln Park and are looking for a great date night spot, Willow Room lives up to the hype!!",

First, we had to wait over 20 minutes past our reservation time to get a table, after being brought downstairs and a server telling the hostess we couldn't sit there because a large group was coming in 90 minutes. Then we waited at the bar where both bartenders ignored us for 10 minutes while trying to order drinks. We were finally seated and our waiter was very nice...but after an hour of being at the restaurant we realized we still didn't have any food, and that's when our entrees arrived prior to our appetizers. Even though we told them we no longer needed the appetizers, they still brought them and comp'd them...along with a round of drinks we had while waiting for our food to arrive. Every other table in the restaurant seemed to not be having the same issues we were having and we did ask if we were being punk'd but no one on staff would confirm our appearance on an upcoming reality show...and we never did manage to have a manager come over and apologize for the entire evening.",

We asked the waitress/waiter multiple times as to where our food was. Of course we assumed that there would be some sort of apitzer so eventually my grandmother went and asked for bread and butter. They said we \"don't normally serve that\". They then came out with a microwaved plate of bread and a scoop of butter. The service was terrible and after the hour passed still there was no food, we left and went to a much more reliable and amazing restaurant. Therefore ruining our image of this restaurant.",
