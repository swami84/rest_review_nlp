Covid19 protocol was on deck, temperature check and names were required before entry. The few groups of celebrating gatherers, 2 maybe 3 tops were spaced accordingly and signs were everywhere, even the bathroom reminding us that we were safe in this establishment. Masks on deck with smiles that you knew were there behind the masks, professional staff and service but the music was blah!!! Pretty sure it was an outsourced D.J. that needed a gig, lol! Top shelf drinks are light on tang as well as a pretty good tap on the wallet. I didn't dine here but the atmosphere was welcoming and I shall return! Pro tip, pre-game first and enjoy the space and the welcoming environment to cut loose post covid19!",

A random lady who I'm not sure if she work there or not told us to seat ourselves. After that we sat there for 20 minutes. Before I got up went to the bar and asks for a waitress. So we ordered after about 15 more minutes. You get Appetizer and entree . And a bottle of champagne for $45. So in the meantime I ordered a hookah. In which lil mama's that I ordered from try to confuse you with the price. But basically I'm going to say it was 35,but gave her 40 dollars. She didn't bring any change back. I was going to tip her anyway. Sooooo. Anyway I managed to smoke all my hooka mind you by myself.  And no food yet. Ok over a hour goes by finally food. But why is it the entree? They forgot to make  The appetizers. So we ate that frist after I had the asks for Utensils sooooo lol now asks for a hookah refill from a different hookah gril why she gave me back to the same girl. More double talk. She must have thought I was going to over pay again.  So when she left to refill. We ask the other hookah girl what was the refill price. 20$ and that's what she got. She almost look confused. Smh. So again waiting for our appetizers again which took 30 from us finishing our entrees they started coming out 1 by 1 in 10 minutes intervals. Smh but the food was absolutely amazing. We had the Fried calamari, Shrimp mon fongo. And the DJ  was super awesome. Bless our waitresses heart she try but service  is so super slow.",

I  purchased 4 vouchers on living social, I used 1 to celebrate a birthday and I got to say that they were attentive as soon as we arrived, despite being busy with another party. The service was great, the staff including the manager Franklin was great in accommodation to our table after conversation with him about voucher deal. They had just added a special menu for the Groupon/living social vouchers 2 days prior, however it was bypass for today thanks to manager. We're able to choose items from regular menu as stated on site when purchasing voucher. However had to pay extra $10 for certain dish thought it was only like $4 from actual cost of voucher limit. a bit disappointed cause I had purchase like 4 more to used on different time with family and friends.. however , I will ask for refund for the other 3.. for today we were able to order from regular menu.. we did enjoy ourselves and I do however recommend this place for the great food served,  especially if your not to far from here. bonus... they had live music playing after we had our dinner...I may Visit again, however but only if in area.. to owners: please update site for voucher sales, so the people buying will know exactly what they are paying for and not get surprised when arriving to place with different menus or cost. Thank you.",
