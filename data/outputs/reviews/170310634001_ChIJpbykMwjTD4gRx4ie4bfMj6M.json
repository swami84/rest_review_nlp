I got the Nashville hot and although it wasn\u2019t as hot as I was hoping, it tasted incredible and had a great heat to it! The chicken was juicy but still had that delicious fried crunch to it. My bf got the OG fried chicken sandwich and his was equally as juicy, crispy and delicious!  We also ordered the truffle fries and duck fat fries and wow...just wow. So they came soggy, which we figured, but when we popped them in our toaster over for a few mins at 425 they crisped right up and the flavor was everything, especially the truffle fries. Duck fat fries definitely tasted like the crispy skin on a chicken and it was tasty! Will definitely order from here again!",

My partner and I love their bacon jam burger (borderline obsessed), both fried chicken sandwiches, and the duck fat fries with mustard miso butter. Those items keep us coming back for more. Half the time the food is amazing but the rest of the time the cooks seem to throw it together like they don't care at all. It is a huge gamble that often ends in disappointment. Slowly we are stopping trying to get good food from there all together. The biggest issues are with the sides and forgotten sauces and drinks. We do order from Postmates but that is not the issue. At times the elotes can be wet and almost soupy or other times dry from too much powdered cheese and not spicy at all. The cole slaw can also either be extremely watery or basically dry cabbage with pepper. I recently got a salad with rotten lettuce all over the bottom. Not wilted from the chicken but yellow, brown, slimy, and rotten. Their flavors are top notch but they need to get their cooks to follow the same recipes or we will not be coming back, which is extremely saddening because we loved them at one point. Take your chances but don't get your hopes up.",

I wanted to start off by complimenting  the staff, I do not eat bacon and didn't notice one of the burgers had it. Once I received the burger I asked the staff if they could make me a new one and the gladly did even though it was completely my fault for not being fully attentive to the menu description. In terms of the food, the Nashville burger was phenomenal, as was the Gouda Burger. Truffle fries and fried pickles were also very good. 100% would recommend!!",

I picked up my order, took it back with me and then as soon as i cut into it i saw that my burger was still raw, bright pink. I called and told bluebird and they said they would have another burger ready in about 10 minutes. 10 minutes is a very short time to cook a burger all the way through that was my estimated wait time before.  I go back to pick it up take it back and cut into it again and ITS STILL RAW. I literally re-cooked the burger myself on my own time. In my order I wanted two sauces and those were forgotten about as well (they usually forget everytime) I'm glad that i caught this instead of eating it and getting really sick. I probably will not be coming back here. Please cut into your food before eating here!!!!!",

I had already got into 7 bites until I realized my burger was undercooked. I notify doordash and I tried called bluebird and everytime I called I got a dead tone at the end. I got food poisoning and was throwing up repeatedly for the past 6 hours because of my undercooked meat. People should be aware and should be given an option for how you want your meat.

        "caption": "Delicious food in an upscale counter-service style. I've visited twice, and intend on making myself a regular.  First visit, I had the shrimp po' boy and duck fat fries. Being from Maryland, I take seafood seriously, and when it's served in Chicago, I take it with a grain of salt. This exceeded my standards for sure. Giant shrimp and generous portions, all the flavors were on point.  Second visit, I had the Nashville hot. I was hesitant because I don't love spicy food, but this is a total winner. The chicken is outrageously juicy, and the spice is more flavorful than it is heat for the sake of heat. The slaw and pickles really round it out, and the buttery bun is better than Chick-fil-A.  To top it off, the service is friendly and enthusiastic. I wish these guys all the success in the world.",
