I\u2019ve so missed during covid a beautifully crafted cocktail by a master bartender and we received just that. When we wanted one more drink before our dinner reservation (but could really only drink one more) and were planning on sipping/sharing out of the same vessel, the bartender unprompted split the drink for us and put it in two beautiful glasses with their own garnishes. We felt like we were treated so well and it\u2019s a beautiful spot. We live uptown and will absolutely make Sugar Monk a regular drink place for friendly meetups and dates.",

It is intimate, charming, and sexy - great for a two person date (I did that) or a Girl's Night Out or a catch up between friends! It holds less than 50 people, so it will never get too raucous for the evening!  The DRINKS. These are the BEST drinks I've ever had. There is a beautiful attention to detail that each cocktail has that is so special. My date and I tried 3 different drinks and had a total of five drinks consumed for the evening. And we didn't even touch the vast array of delicious drinks left on the menu. Absolutley Superb! Be prepared to spend $15 - $18 per drink! So worth it!  Lastly, the service was very inviting, kind, and respectful.  I felt valued by the owner, the bartending staff, and my waitress. The owner/manager made sure I felt comfortable and offered advice for choosing from the drinks.  Run to this place! A gem of a spot in Harlem! I'll definitely be back! Thank you for the amazing service!",

A must visit for any cocktail enthusiast in the city, it'll certainly be worth the journey.  Easy walking distance to the subway makes this an excellent option for those located around midtown looking to escape the madness or anywhere off the A/D express lines.  Quick Summary: Excellent cocktails and bar staff.  A true gem in NYC.  January 2020 Update: The bar is still delivering impeccable cocktails from their menu.  While the menu is large (I doubt I could order all of the drinks), I'd love to see them rotate the menu from time to time to keep me excited for what's new (or a specials board).",

And don\u2019t forget the food. We more than enjoyed the olives and pickles, charcuterie and the hummus. Each plate was a winner. The hummus was so special we asked the charming owner for the ingredients and learned they have two different hummus recipes. The one we enjoyed had harissa in it but they also have one made with beets! when we return, which we will, we will order the hummus again and will be happy no matter which recipe is being served. We topped the experience off with the handmade chocolates!  I wish I took more and better photos but better you come and see Sugar Monk for yourself.",

        "caption": "An adorable spot with amazing handcrafted cocktails. The dedication to crafting these amazing drinks is worth watching and also worth the hefty price tag. They have a literal book of drinks to choose from all different and all with infusions I\u2019ve never heard of. Unless you are a mixologist of the same capacity you probably wouldn\u2019t know have of the stuff they mix together but to me that made it more fun. The bartender was very helpful on deciding and explaining. Personally I picked randomly and I was not disappointed. I had a delicious spiced bourbon martini that smelled like Christmas. We also had delicious infused truffles one was champagne the other was tequila and espresso and the last was a Manhattan, yes all truffles and yes all delicious. If you happen to spot it outside the first thing you\u2019ll notice is it\u2019s dark and hidden with a large ornate dark wooden door. Inside it looks like you\u2019re taken a step back in time, dark walls, soft lounge chairs, and beautiful glassware complete the aesthetic. This is an expensive cocktail bar but more importantly it is an excellent cocktail bar. 15/10 must visit",
