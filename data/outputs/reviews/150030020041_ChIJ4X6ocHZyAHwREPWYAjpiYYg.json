Others in our party had fresh fish with a variety of accompanying sauces.  For dessert, we all shared Roy's signature dessert: chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  The service was impeccable.  Dining tables were well spaced out to enforce social distancing, and the open design of the restaurant further gave us a sense of safety.  (All waitstaff were properly masked, as well.)  Everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed our dinner  and the superb service that we received throughout our meal.  We look forward to returning again, soon!",

Smiley his name is Luis we could not have asked for better service in the most amazing steak I have ever put in my mouth the potatoes and the corn everything was a five-star he recommended dessert that we should order it a little early cuz everything is made fresh please please take this advice if your friend ever ever asked you if you want dessert immediately say yes if your friend is asking you if they want dessert that means they want dessert don't deprive them just because you might not be in the mood for dessert it's okay for you to change your mind after it is once on the table but don't ever slow down the ordering Rams looking out for friends so happy I discovered Hawaii never going back",

I waited about 15 minutes and sat down. Although the number of seats is large, it may be better to make a reservation if possible.  They ordered one appetizer and one main. (This amount was just right)  The appetizer Smoked Ahi Dip ($ 12) was made with tuna paste and toast, which was surprisingly delicious! This alone is quite full ...  Mainly, salmon (Seared Ora King Salmon $ 38) was soft and the sauce was good and the answer was correct. Unfortunately, the Ahi steak (like Yukari-crusted Ahi Steak ...) that I ordered was not good enough. But the brown rice that was served was very delicious.  I felt like I was trying out various menus and arrangements.  The atmosphere was relatively lively.

If you're willing to pay a few extra bucks then it is 100% worth it, but if your just looking for some cheap happy hour fun there is better places within the vicinity. I will say that if you can make it to their,  \"Power Hour\" between 5 and 6pm the prices are much better.",

We tried several foods and liked them all - Brussels sprouts appetizer,  calamari- but the tiny squid was a bit undercooked,  the paella is quite tasty - even though it looked small,  3 of us still had leftovers.  The baked cake desert was so good. The fish was delicious.  And they let us sit and just visit with our friend.  I would return. Incidentally,  the burgers looked really good,  for next time.",

What made this place stand out to us however was the incredible service. The staff is not only extremely knowledgeable of the menu but they were highly attentive. We were blown away by our server, Louis. The guy was world class in his hospitality. If you get lucky to be served by this individual you will not be disappointed. The other staff helping out as well were just as professional. Bryson who was part of the wait staff treated us like gold. If these two individuals reflect the entire team at The Eating House then you are in great hands. We will definitely be coming back!",

My wife and mother both ordered the butter fish and the results were mixed. My mother got a beautiful piece of fish, perfectly cooked. My wife on the other hand got a thin, rubbery, greasy fish that was not at all up to par. The rice that accompanied both dishes was just not good, mushy and very bland.

        "caption": "This is an awesome place to eat--so much so that we went twice in a matter of days.  I have some significant dietary restrictions (allergies) that make it difficult to eat out. Usually when I tell servers about my restrictions, they are not received particularly well. Sometimes a server seems annoyed or irritated, but at best, they are hesitantly accommodating. Our server, Kimmie, was very understanding of my restrictions and treated my situation more like a fun challenge. Kimmie worked with the kitchen to figure out what I could eat and gave me a lot of great options for wonderful meals. The food was delicious and my date was thrilled that I was so happy\u2014perhaps better described as giddy\u2014so it was a big win for him as well.  In addition to Kimmie\u2019s excellent service and the delicious food, I was so happy to have had the best old fashioneds I have had in a long time. I have them wherever I go and even try to make them myself. So when I get one that is well done, I\u2019m floored. These old fashioneds were so amazing that we had several each and the bartender was kind enough to send out the recipe for me so I could try to recreate it at home.  A few nights later we hit the town again for dinner and decided that the only place we wanted to go was the Eating House. So we asked to have Kimmie again, and we had another wonderful night full of delicious food and cocktails.  The wait staff, kitchen, and bar staff helped me to have a safe night while enjoying delicious food. And even the management was great. Thanks for being a great restaurant that handles food allergies beautifully. You're awesome and I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area again. In the meantime....consider branching out to Colorado? :)",

So onto sharing about the Eating House. Casual dining in an open air but covered eatery. Prices are $$-$$$ but when you experience the flavorful combinations, that's what you'll remember the most. And if it's your birthday, you receive the most amazing panna cotta dessert ever! The flavors weren't overpowering each other. It was just yum! And so refreshing! For my next visit, I'm going to enjoy their take on the paella. Can't wait!",

I asked about a dish, verifying that the dish didn't have certain ingredients. She confirmed what was in the dish, so I ordered it. Took forever, not to mention my father had wanted his soup and salad together, but they brought the soup first anyways. We finally got our food and my dish was filled with ingredients that I didn't like. Had to speak to different server to have it taken away, our server didn't come to check on us for about another 10 minutes after our food came to the table. What angers me the most is that she came by and said \"So I hear you didn't like your dish?\" as if I didn't like the dish as a whole. I didn't like it because it was filled with stuff that I specifically asked to not have in it. Terrible experience.",

The atmosphere here is very Waikiki, busy, bustling, vaguely indifferent, very touristy, and loud. We had a table near the edge of the dining area near the valet/parking lot and it wasn't too bad, but it was noticable. The servers were friendly but not the most attentive, especially for how many there were that stopped by our table throughout the 2.5 hours we were there. Drinks were fine. The food was up to Roy's standard but a little more down to earth and accessible with burgers and steaks, poke and salads. The presentation was beautiful and every thing was scrumptious. It was funny that this was a poke bowl though...it's a musubi. Did I read that wrong on the menu?",
