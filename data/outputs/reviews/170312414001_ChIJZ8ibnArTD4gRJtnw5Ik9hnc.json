Here are the positives of this place: - Great Location/The Overall look of the place is A1 - Good Music - Great Drinks - Good Prices - My friend said \u201cWhoever seasons/cooks the steak knows what they are doing\u201d lol  Here are the negatives: - The waitress was too busy taking selfies w/ duck lips to keep up with her tables (Key issue: A friend ordered bottomless mimosas along with most of my party. She forgot my friend\u2019s glass multiple times. She did receive the glass about 15-20min later than the rest of us) -  Overall the food is OKAY (It was recommended that the chicken and waffles were good without the fruity pebbles.... incorrect. It had zero flavor.  The salad was bomb (but I mean who can mess up salad though)  Veggie empanada was pretty good and it looked aesthetically pleasing! (What I ordered)  There was an issue with incorrect food being brought out. I ordered veggie and was given meat. Situation was rectified but after that it seemed as thought things went sour  The manager approached us (with an attitude) saying she saw the review that was left (my friend immediately left a review while we were still dining). The manager offered to give us a discount which was nice but she was not apologetic. It was almost as though we were an inconvenience for her.  Once we received the check, we were charged 6 bottomless mimosas when only 5 of us ordered bottomless. So we add this to the many issues that were going on. When this was addressed, again, it seemed as though we were like nitpicking or like addressing a mistake was uncallled for. (If you charge me for something or bring a wrong item out, by consumer rights, you are obligated to say something. It just makes sense.  After the check was corrected, some other waitress walks up and tells us we have an hour after our food is ordered to wrap up and leave. (She said it in a nicer way than the way I put it just now) She also stated that there was someone else who RSVP\u2019d for that table. Which I get, especially for busy places, there is a time allotted to eat and drink.  But here\u2019s my thing, 1) why is this not anywhere on the menu. 2) why isn\u2019t my waitress telling me this 3) I felt that it was out of spite because of everything that transpired before. 4) We still had 4 pitchers of mimosas on our table we still needed to finish.  This place has soooo much potential. I just need them to get it together so they can retain customers.  More than likely, I would not be back unless I\u2019m sitting at the bar for just drinks.",

All of the sudden, two of the extra film-crew members standing outside (who were doing nothing but also starring inside) started being very disrespectful and yelling at us. Their level of disrespect was appalling. A third crew member got out of the van parked right in front and threaten to assault me, was very profane, and used verbally abusive language. My girlfriend and I had to rapidly leave fearing our lives might be in danger.  All for what, because we slowed down while walking past a restaurant? They could have just nicely told us that we were disrupting their ability to work or something and asked nicely if we could not stand where we were (on the sidewalk, outside, for only 2 seconds....).

Brought just after reminder, it was a Caesar salad. Without sauce! for the full price! Salad, in which the main ingredient sauce, without sauce! Are you kidding me? for $8!

Our bartender made a mistake when placing the order, and ended up bringing us the wrong food. We attempted to get his attention multiple times,  but he was too busy chatting with co workers and playing with his phone to notice. More than 10 minutes passed before he checked in and realized a mistake had been made.  Same story with the check.  We sat at the bar with empty plates and glasses while the bartender played with his phone.  Wasn't even busy, we were one of 3 tables. There is no shortage of better options in the neighborhood; I would suggest you try them instead.",
