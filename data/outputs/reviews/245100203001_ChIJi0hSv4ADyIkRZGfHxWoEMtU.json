They handled our crowd with ease. The owner and Brooke put together a fabulous selection of choices for us. The meat and cheese platter was all of great quality. Salad and appetizers were excellent. Try the duck egg rolls. Amazingly good. For dinner some had steaks which were all cooked to perfection. I as well as many ordered the crab cakes. They were easily the best that I have ever had. I also tried the smoked crab cakes. I'm not a fan of smoked anything but the flavor of these were fantastic. A mild smoke with more of a sherry flavor. Not overpowering at all. Just delicious. I will surely visit the Pierpoint again.",

The crab cakes were indeed yummy. They had a smoked version and a standard. I liked the standard a bit better but the smoked was an interesting twist. We had a pasta dish with pumpkin filling and a gorgonzola sauce which was also interesting but we thought the cheese was a bit overpowering. Service was attentive, atmosphere cozy and the chef does the cooking in an open air setting which I always like.",

We hung out trying to ignore the smell. \ud83d\ude37 We ordered wine & appetizers. The wine & appetizers were great. I recommend the duck spring rolls, amazing flavor. Although we ignored the smell there was a group of fruit flys (gnats) that flew around our heads and faces like insects tend to do. I am not sure what the smell and bugs were about but it was highly discouraging.\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28 For dinner I ordered the crab cake special for which this restaurant is known, they made it onto the Food Network. The crab cake special included 1 smoke & 1 traditional crab cake served with fries and brussel sprout slaw. The presentation was okay.\ud83d\ude11 The actual food left plenty to be desired. The slaw wasn't even shredded just chunks of brussel sprouts covered in mayonnaise that was a NO for me\u2639  The crab cakes were okay as well nothing special I've had better. The crab cake were droopy & wet on the inside. We laughed our way through dinner and enjoyed one another's presence as a group. However, this was an experience but not one I will repeat any time soon. First impressions are everything. The staff was pleasant but you cannot convince me that they didn't smell that horrid smell.",

My friend and I were dining in from out of town, and we'd just left a line dancing event, and we wanted authentic Maryland seafood, crab cakes to be exact and we found this spot. I will warn you that parking can be difficult in this area, especially during the height of the weekend at peak dining hours. However, we arrived shortly after 7 pm, found a decent space within walking distance of the restaurant, and we were so happy to have chosen this place to come dine. It reminded me of some of my favorite downtown restaurants in Boston. I love that it's literally a little nook in the cut! If the outer facade wasn't painted, \"yellow\" you would miss it.  First and foremost, when we walked in it felt like we were walking into a family member's home. It\u2019s casual in appearance. The Chef/Owner, Nancy was super nice, and invited us in. She was entertaining a few friends that had just completed dinner and dessert, and they were just chatting as we arrived. She seated us, and gave us menus. Everyone was so nice! We ended up chatting with the other group and that was really nice. We even found out that the owner is friends with someone we line dance with. We ended up ordering the crab cakes and I added steak. The food was delicious. The steak was decent, but the crab cakes made up for the steak. The crab cakes was lumpy and perfect! I loved them! The owner also made us a couple of margaritas that we ordered, and it was so refreshing and good! I can tell this is a neighborhood favorite because, she's been in that location for 30 years. It's definitely a place I will be returning to because, the food was good and the conversation was even better! The owner shared with us, some of her really wonderful life stories. It was so awesome to meet her and talk with her because, she's very active in the community and with mentoring Baltimore's inner city youth through her cooking classes, and she's very passionate about building, improving and sustaining the cultural integrity and history of the City of Baltimore. I just love this is definitely the kind of place \"where everybody knows your name...CHEERS!\" Check them out the next time you're in downtown Baltimore! I promise you will not be sorry! As one of the previous reviews mentioned, if you\u2019re looking for a spot with a \u201csleek\u201d appearance and contemporary dining experience, then this is not the place. It feels like home, its a little dated (But who cares, I liked how it looked. She\u2019s been there 30 years and that means more to me.), but the crab cakes and conversation alone is enough to make you come and just hang for a bit!",

At first we checked out recommended places in Fells Point only to find out there would be a 1 hr to 1 1/2 hour wait so after a little research we lucked out and discovered basically a small place a few blocks back in off of the main drag waterfront. At first there were only a few folks dinning and wondered if we had made a mistake. Could my research have failed me? From the outside it just looked like a hole in the wall but we walked in anyway and was probably one of the best meals my wife and I had in quite some time. I had the double crab cakes 1 smoked and 1 traditional, corn chowder, salad... My wife had the soft shell crab which was amazing and do not leave without trying the most luscious bread pudding we have ever had! Do not and I repeat do not judge the book by its cover.",

I have had Chef Longo's crabcakes in a controlled temperature environment, and they are delicious! Even under hot NYC studio lights they are good. And as for the smell in the restaurant Ms. Barker spoke of: again, it was hot, it was humid, and it is a small space. And it always smells delicious in there!!",

The crab cakes smelled like they were cooked in rancid butter on a dirty grill.  Not the aroma I wanted driving back to NJ.  I ended up putting them in the trunk. The second was the size,  at $18 each I expected a larger crab cake, definitely over priced.  Ok,  size doesn't matter but taste does...this crab cake was not good.  I'm not picky,  but want what I pay for and this was not worth the $$ or the bad taste it left. Worse crab cake I've ever eaten.",
