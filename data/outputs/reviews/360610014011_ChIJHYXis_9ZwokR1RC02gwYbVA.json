I took a fry out and ate it. It was different. I took another to eat to figure out the taste. My brother in law said it was brine in pickle juice. Very interesting. I also tried the sauce and it was good. Also tried the comeback sauce. I was eating them and then my sister comes home and clearly I forgot to send her the photos. If you're looking for crunchy fries, these aren't but they weren't exactly soggy. It's a bit addictive. Fries tasted good with and without the sauce. I also got their watermelon lemonade. It came in a cool plastic bag that stands up. You can zip it up when you're not drinking it. You tasted both the watermelon and lemonade. I forgot to shake it so it was sour from the lemonade haha",

They were everything I had imagined and more. The pairing of sauces is impeccable. The Sriracha Aioli and Onion Aioli were perfect with each.  I'm planning my next pre-flight excursion to include a Beyond Burger and the signature Fried Pickles.  This is NOT a snack bar as listed with Google. While you can grab a snack they have a full meal menu with spectacular flavor combinations.  They are also very dietary conscious.  They offer vegan, gluten free, and Kosher options.  Well worth the time if you have it.",

The fried pickles are made fresh using pickles from The Pickle Guys right next door. Also, they serve 2 types of lemonade which are made with their homemade pickled fruits. I highly recommend trying the watermelon lemonade! They are currently running a promotion on Sundays in which you can get a free lemonade when placing an order, if you follow their IG account.",

I'm happy The Pickle Guys decided to make an extension on something they've been cornering the market on! It's great for a quick bite or with a group of friends. Although space is limited, the park is just a block away and you're able to enjoy their delicious food on the benches. Amazing to see them develop something you just don't get around the Lower East Side.  My favorite is (of course) their signature fried pickles as well as the rice balls. Brine fries is a close 3rd to my list. Beyond Burger is a nice touch with its popularity. I've been trying to cut down on meat and it's a nice substitute. All in all, I'm grateful for their hard work and will happily recommend to anyone. Great food and staff! Keep up the good work fellas!",

The folks who work here are also super friendly and personable which I always find to be a big positive. I highly recommend Diller if you have a large appetite.
