I have tried other pad Thai from other Thai restaurants, and others really don't compare to Thai Oscars. I like the spider maki, spring rolls, egg rolls, and fried leek dumplings as appetizers. I still need to try more. Thai iced coffee and tea is really good as well.",

It was breaded fried veggies, like if my mom made fried veggies, I've had better tempura at the county fair... Bad.",

I like to compare Thai places based on their pad thai since it's so ubiquitous. So take that as a good sign they care about the quality of their dishes. OH and the fried tofu sticks appetizer is really awesome.",

This place has THE BEST crab rangoon and I absolutely love their Woonsen Pad Thai with chicken. Now their sushi isnt the best but it always is a nice complement to the thai food, I think the maki choices with shrimp tempura suck bc their tempura batter isnt up to par. But all the other maki choices are yummy.",
