The inside was set up kind of like a (pre-covid) book shop / cafe with 2 big tables and some armchairs. Really great and unique looking place. They also have some (usable but still incomplete) seating outside.  The food was spectacular. We had Duck and Crab dumplings and the Tonkatsu. All of it was perfect. I was particularly impressed by the unique consistency of the rice in the tonkatsu. it was very sticky and soft like you would have in a mango sticky rice dessert but this was for a savory dish that worked perfectly with the chicken and sauce.  The best part of this place was the service. The people working there were very vested in making sure that we had a perfect experience there and held themselves to a very high standard. For example, even though we didn't even notice that time had passed because we were having a great time chatting at the place, a staff member came up and apologized for the delay it took to bring out our dish and offered us beverages to make up for the inconvenience. I thought this was a very classy move and showed their strong customer focus.  The food, service, and decor was amazing. I expect and hope that this place becomes a very popular one soon! Until then, I'll enjoy this hidden gem while I can.",

Dumplings are innovative and excellent, whether steamed or fried. Get the reco itch fish and corn soup when they\u2019re on the menu. Borrow a book from their library.
