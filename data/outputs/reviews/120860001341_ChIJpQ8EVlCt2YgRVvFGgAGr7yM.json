Their fig lamb chops and steak is cooked beautifully but could use seasoning. The fig was over bearing for the meat but if you love that figgy taste then you should try it. AND for my octopus lovers -- this is to die for.... it will literally melt in your mouth and full of flavor!!! Will definitely be coming back to try more of their most popular dishes \ud83d\ude0a.

I enjoy the option to either dine in or sit on the patio which is covered. The staff is welcoming and VERY ATTENTIVE! Which makes your experience so much better. Hector the manager along with 2 others came to check in our table several times. Our waiter was such a sweetheart, and explained the menu very well! Now on the BEST PART....PASTA!!! Well let\u2019s start with the presentation... the chef comes to your table with fresh handmade pasta and a giant Parmesan wheel. They finish your pasta by tossing it in the wheel, then plating to serve. It was such an amazing sight to see, and the taste. Out of this world!!! Your food is 100% fresh and not frozen. The sauce, cheese and lobster were cooked to perfection. I mean it was truly a beautiful moment in every bite. The fresh bread and oil were so delicious and our drink was delightful. To finish the manager gave us the cutest hand written card and free appetizer for the next visit.( forgot mine by accident)...but the thought just made the experience so special. I would recommend this restaurant to the ENTIRE WORLD!",

But this restaurant made it happen. The vibe was great. The manager was very nice. We we're hesitant to go to this location as it didn't have that many reviews but we were advised by the manager it was because they only open up a month ago.we are glad we went.

The server had an attitude and the manager was even worse. The food was good but unfortunately the all experience was terrible. They are plenty of other Italian Restaurants in the mall that puts this one to shame. They give you an attitude if you have pets and won\u2019t let you sit outside with them.

When we arrived the hostess was less than welcoming. We told her we had a reservation and were told that even though we had a reservation it was going to be at least a 10 minute wait. The hostess was rude and rolled her eyes after making us aware that we needed to wait. So, although we weren\u2019t happy we understood and patiently sat down to wait. Soon after 3 large parties arrived. One was seated right upon arrival and another argued that they had an 8:15pm reservation and needed to be seated exactly by that time. They bullied the manager into being seated before us. Although we had already been waiting for at least 15 minutes and had an 8pm reservation. Of course we felt belittled and appalled that they would sit several people before us( a party of 3)! My husband and I decided to leave and will NEVER return to this location. I recommend the Doral location instead of this piece of junk location. Shame on the management for rewarding bad behavior!",

Johnny was an incredible server and was more than happy to offer his own suggestions and be available whenever needed. Supported by it's prohibition era theme, the drinks offered here are extensive and well-crafted. The white sangria was not overly sweet and had a nice balance. The smoked old fashioned was the best I ever had and is a bit of a cool spectacle when it's brought to the table. The meals were exceptional - Tuscan salmon grilled and seasoned perfectly and the the lamb chops were cooked and dressed to perfection as well. Ambiance is relaxed yet still lively and comfy. There are also gluten free options for those who require the choice. Prices are well suited for the experience here.",

The hostess was nice to sit me down, and I didn't have to wait too long, and the server Juan Carlos, I think he mentioned he was Peruvian, he explained the specialties of the restaurant. I ended up eating Mascarpone Pasta, really good food. and he also suggested some signature drinks, that I'd like to try next time I come here. Everyone took the time to make sure I was comfortable and food was well done. Nice restaurant inside the mall",

Once I came back to dine with my friend I was greeted with a smile and sat at a table the atmosphere was friendly and positive everyone had a nice attitude and professionalism. The quality of the food was great and pricing was what you\u2019d expect in a location as such.  The experience was amazing and I met the manager a second time whereas she stayed to chat for a bit. If you\u2019re in the Aventura area check out this location in the Aventura mall. You will not be disappointed.  Thank you for having us,  Manny.",
