However the manager who had to make a price adjustment because the price I was going to be charger was not the price on the menu was absolutely rude and on the verge of being disrespectful. He was annoyed with me for making an adjustment and then he charged me double the tax and twice for a condiment that is usually free. He made the entire experience aggravating and still he managed to swindle me out of the balance.  Then he started to undo what the cashier bagged  to check how much food they put in the containers-the lovely cashier put an end to that.  Don't know if he was having a bad day but that was no way to deal with a customer.  Just had to update-looks like he owes me a $5 side that is not with my order.",

The food display is very clean and has a nice presentation. The staff is usually very courteous and accommodating. The food is well prepared and they usually have a good variety of entrees to choose from. Overall the taste is good and very satisfying. The price is moderate considering it's an Express place (no waiters or waitress). A few gripes about this place. One being the utensils they use. They have bottom tier pre packaged utensils, but do not have bottom tier pricing. Wendy's has better utensils than this place those. I really wish owners of these places would pay attention to the details that really make the experience at the place much more pleasant to the patrons. It really sucks to have to cut your Yuca with a bending knife, and to try and get your ropa vieja with a twisting fork. It literally almost entirely depletes the joy of being able to eat a great meal in heavenly enjoyment when you have to shift your focus from the flavors, to having to craft your meal with the subpar cutlery. We need more available table salt, enough to not have to wait for someone else to finish using it. We need an easier, more available way to be able to have water without having to actually purchase water, or have to wait online to ask for a cup for water (which often gets challenged bc there's a fountain machine with sodas available). I'm certain there's a law regarding this. Perhaps including a small water bottle with every meal upon request given the price being paid (Pruzzo's Deli includes a 16 oz. Kirkland water bottle with the purchase of any deli sandwich or hot meal at no additional cost) I'm sure that although it may increase your expense by a few dollars per case, it will greatly increase your revenue overall bc more people will know they will have a more affordable complete meal here. There tends to be a lot of clutter in the passage/hallway that leads to the back once you pass the fountain machine. It's a bit of an eyesore. This feedback is actually constructive, and most business would love to have it. So I will say you're welcome for the feedback and I look forward to the possibility of these improvements being implemented. Prioritize on the utensils though. That would be greatly appreciated. Next time I come around, I'll be looking for the change. If I see it, I'll update the review and add another star. Overall a good place to have a nice meal, despite the above. I recommend.",

Food was good, they have traditional Spanish foods, such as carne guisada, ropa vieja, chicken, rices, beans, platains, etc. The spanish foods stuff.  Food was good, they have menu options of 1 meat with 2 sides.  Some for $8, others for $12 and when you get the fish or salmon, a but more.  There are Coronas, and jarribos to drink. Expect to pay $5 for a beer, yes $5. I think they make a lit of money of the drinks as the place looks like a sports bar.  Big TV and lovely ladies.  Parking is available as it's a mall with other stores and food places.  Enjoy.",

At this point I'm watching my meal not covered and dealing with a clueless employee 3rd the guy rings me up at one price then another lady whispered and then he said no is more money at this point I was expecting my two orders and my friend order to be together. They did not now I'm standing there asking where is his food and why I was charged a crazy amount for two orders and some drinks.the women became so irate she called a guy who stated he was the manager. Simply because I did not want the drinks any more. This manager then decided to take care of the entire people waiting and leaving us for last to get  a refund. The female employee should definitely find another job other than serving clients. The food was under cooked pork chops had red blood in it and the only salad i got had no dressing no utensil just a plain plate with lettuce and avocado. This place made me feel discriminated and i will never visit this location.  And i will report health department violations noted.",

One customer even had my exact order and eating it at table and entered 15 minutes after. My shrimp mofongo were tiny baby shrimps and far less than past visits. Few customers laughing at the young lady opening 2 packs of Oscar Meyers Ham for sandwiches (cant get cheaper).
