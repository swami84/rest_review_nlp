What I don\u2019t Understand is that my husband has been calling from the same number he ordered form several times after waiting over an hour and they did not answer. As soon as we called from a different number they answered. And when asked them what is going on with our order they told us it\u2019s on it\u2019s  way. It did arrive at 12:33am cold and nasty. I attempted to call several times and they kept picking up the phone and not speaking. The guy we spoke to on the phone earlier his name was Sam (Sameer) is what he actually told us. The worst customer service. Could not eat the food as it was cold. Will be calling the manger tomorrow as this is not acceptable. We pay for the food to be delivered and this type of services I wouldn\u2019t accept even if it was free. Horrible !!!!",

They have more 1 star reviews than anything else and don't believe the 5 star reviews because they are fake like someone else said. This place is horrible. Citing some \"security policy\" they won't deliver to your door. So I contacted corporate and looked on their website and there is no such policy so when I said that to the manager, she said it is up to the discretion of the driver if he wants to take that risk. So I asked her what do you do for elderly, pregnant women, disabled, customers with children, who cannot come outside to pick up the delivery? She didn't have an answer. So if you are disabled, elderly, pregnant, and/or have small children, don't bother ordering from this place. Actually, nobody should order from this place. Then I asked for the name of the MCO, she wouldn't give it. So I asked for her name and all she said was \"Ali\" I said I need a last name and she refused to give it and hung up. Horrible management, horrible customer service, and horrible staff. STAY AWAY!",

I asked the delivery guy what was the situation because I tried calling and I couldn't even cancel my order if I wanted to since I already paid and couldn't get hold of a person in the store. He informed me that they have more deliveries than drivers and the store manager is terrible and refuses to get more needed drivers for certain days they are swamped. It is incredible to me that they can have me waiting for 3 hours without calling and notifying me what the situation was or give me the opportunity to cancel my order. I feel terrible for the delivery guys who will end up getting skipped on tips because of their managers poor managing of the store. I pay my money and they can't even offer an apology or credit for something else at another time. This store manager clearly can't manage and needs to be replaced or retrained immediately. This is the second time I waited hours for a pizza at this location and to conclude I will no longer ever use that store.",

I'm like that's interesting that I have to pay 9 extra for 3 less toppings? Fine.. He gives me the pizza, I paid. I open the box and it has also bacon, pepper and something else. I'm like, this is not what I ordered. He argues with me that this is the Hawaiian pizza. Shows me on the menu. It says Honolulu Hawaiian. I'm like i didn't want this. He goes they can make mine but it's 15 mins. I'm like, fine, but deliver it. He tells me he has to charge me another 5 for delivery. I'm like no. I paid 19.95 for a large 2 topping pizza, when you have some special going on. Just deliver my 10.95 pizza for 19.95. He is like he can't do that. Do I want to cancel. Yes I want to cancel but I have no dinner either. I told him you need to ask if you have different hawaiian pizzas which one I want. Mind you i wanted a basic ham and pineapple which is a hawaiian pizza everywhere else in the country. Never going there again. Rude, no customer service skills... he supposedly reversed my payment, which I'll see in a couple of days. But still hingry... thanks Dominos...",

I ordered 2X from the Lefferts location and both time the food was not fully cooked! Tired to order again but only got the option for Lefferts store which would take 94-104 mins! Called the store 2x only to get some to put me on hold and never came back to the line. How horrible! Ended up ordering from the 78th st store and will pick up. I should have the option to order from which ever store I prefer I am a paying customer and the 78th loc have delivered to my home many times prior to this new location opening.",

While on the phone with the \"manager\" he hung up on me. I went to the story, made a scene and the \"manager\" said I gave him false information.After he hung up Dina (a worker) called me and told me the pizza was still in the oven and agreed I shouldn't have been hung up on because its rude.  basically, horrible customer service. they chose anyone to be the manager. if you have any problem, Dina is great to talk to!",

There are a bunch of them and some do not know how to pay attention to customers. Sometimes,  they just keep talking between each other.  They have this system that shows your name on a screen when your food is ready.  They have no problem getting your order,  but to give you the food when is ready is a totally different matter.  YOU have to call their attention and tell them that your food is on the rack .   That's when they decide to check the boxes with food and give it to you.  YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM???  That is ridiculous!!! The last time I was there, I was going to place a take out order.  It looked like they were taking care of a large order for someone else because they were putting a bunch of boxes together.  The first thing the worker DOES NOT say to me is \"Welcome to Domino's\",  but he says instead  \"it is going to take 40 minutes if you order,  we are very busy\".  I looked at him and I walked out of the place. I will NEVER go back or order online from Domino's again. Since I live close by,  the food would be coming from this location.  I refuse to give  my business for a location that treats customers  this  way.  Their pizza is not always good either. I gave them a pass on that a couple of times,  but the rudeness and treatment when I was there the  last time is not acceptable.  A real business must know how to take care of ALL customers,  small or large orders. It was unprofessional and discriminating.  This  Domino's location lost a customer and I'm sure they will lose many more. I would rather order or stop by at Alphie's Pizzaria.  They have been around this  area a long time and they know how to take care and keep their customers. Plus,  Alphie's pizza is one of the best!!",
