Brian went well beyond the call of duty to accommodate the vegans making several trips to our table to suggest various dishes he could provide before coming up with a veggie pasta and salad. He was wonderful with the kids also. The food at Filuppo's is always outstanding as is the service, however Brian took it to another level that night. You are missing a great treat if you haven't been here yet.",

The quality is worthy of four stars relative to the price, but at $52 for a ribeye, the quality doesn\u2019t rate 5 stars.  Also, my wife ordered a filet, but they brought her a ribeye. I rated it down one more because we took our three kids and I asked them to split an adult meal (spaghetti and meatballs) between two of them (ages 5 and 7). My eldest, 9, ordered an adult meal for himself, shrimp pasta and soup. They said they wouldn\u2019t split the spaghetti, but could bring an extra plate.  They forgot the extra plate. We reminded them about it. They never brought it. We used the bread plate. Then when reviewing the bill I saw the charged $7 for the extra plate we never got. I didn\u2019t ask them to fix it as it was a $250 bill and I usually leave 20%, so I just subtracted the extra plate charge from the tip. Anyway, won\u2019t return a third time.",

The food is good quality and the prices are upscale as is the service. Unfortunately I think this place suffers from the same condition most Italian restaurants that claim to be upscale in the region have, their food is not bad but it's really not distinctive either. The ingredients don't seem as fresh as really good Italian food should be imo. For the prices they charge, is disappointing that they also try to upsell you on extra things to top your entree with. All Things Considered, this place is consistently among the better Italian places in the area.",

The shrimp appetizer with olive oil and garlic was delish. Their red gravy was a tad bit sweet to me but delicious. Everyone else at the table absolutely loved their entrees (Trout Almondine, Veal Marsala, Veal Picatta and an Alfredo dish) all saying can it was the best they've ever had. The Tiramisu was excellent. Their bread pudding was OMG! You could really taste the cinnamon but it wasn't overwhelming. We had to wait for a bit for our entrees but so worth the wait. Oh, I forgot.

They said it was the second busiest day since Thanksgiving and they were not expecting such a large crowd. It was our first experience and we waited at our table for 3 hours for our food. They were so apologetic that they gave us free drinks and cannoli. And in all honesty after we waited there for 3 hours they should have comped our dinners. We decided to take our food home to go to eat due to the fact that it was so late. But I have to admit it is the best Italian food I have ever eaten. I will not allow this strange occurrence stop me fro giving them another chance. It's a little piece of Italy sitting right smack in the middle of Metairie. Kudos to the chef.",

There's a flaming cheese dish that is brought to your table-- still flaming!!- that I'd highly enjoyed Great for a date or family dining.  It's in a sort of strip mall with safe, free parking but don't let it fool you.... inside is really nice! If I'm ever back in Virginia I would definitely pay them a visit!",

I consider myself a sort of lasagna connoisseur, trying it wherever I can. Most of the time, I leave the restaurant disappointed. Not this time. Hands down, this is the finest slice of lasagna I have ever eaten. The chef pays attention to the smallest details, with layer after layer of perfectly done lasagna noodles interspersed with incredible cheeses, meats, herbs, and, out of nowhere, the thinnest slice of eggplant.  Yep, eggplant.  If I didn't tell you, you would have never guessed.  I talked two in my party into getting it. Both were entirely delighted. All of us took home substantial portions.  So it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway), the portions are HUGE.  The quality outstanding.  The service is perfect, almost appearing out of thin air with a refreshed glass is whatever you were drinking.  I have eaten here in small groups and with a party of 18. I am never disappointed.",

How many years have I wasted finding total satisfaction in a 1st class Italian cuisine Restaurant. Look no further, it is here. Everything you desire and more. How many of you have been looking for the local Italian flavor of the highest quality? Look no more. This is my favorite by far and will share this best kept secret with my family and friends from now on. Thank you very much and we will be a regular in your most special establishment for years to come. This is a place where memories are made. =)",

As we were sitting and eating, we noticed that people kept walking in and saying hello to the staff like old friends. After we introduced ourselves to who turned out to be the owner and felt very welcomed into the community. Definitely recommend the food and the whole experience!",

It should be the nightly special rather than the trout almondine that I took once and I won't take again, it is just not Italian  enough and really not special . There eggplant dish  and appetizer  are delicious. Their salad with crab meat is delicious. Need to make lasagna...... it is an expected dish in an Italian restaurant :) I will go many times again ... just make few little upgrades please.",

The food and service  was nothing to write home about for what we paid. I know I will not be going back to Ristorante Filippo again even if the prices goes down. I was thinking that the great reviews that u read  were written by the owner himself. If you want a good meal for a great price go to the come back inn on west metaire, the food is much better and at a fraction of the cost..I eat there at least 2 or 3 times a week and I have no ownership whatsoever, try it...",
