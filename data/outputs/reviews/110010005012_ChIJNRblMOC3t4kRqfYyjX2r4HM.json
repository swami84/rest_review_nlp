The service there is very professional and they have definitely set the bar high with their adjustments to all the COVID craziness going on.

Definitely check out this place!  Updated Review: I've lived in Woodley Park for over two years and have desperately craved great Indian food. It has finally arrived! Every time I come here the food and service are outstanding. My only regret is that I'm moving to Navy Yard, but the food is so good I'll be making the trip back frequently just for this food!  Original Review: A welcome addition to Woodley Park. The food is amazing!",
