We ordered apps, entrees and dessert, and everything was delicious: carrot appetizer, soup of the day (cheddar with tomato and potato), rabbit stew, trout, duck, chocolate mousse and raspberry amaretto sorbet. Everything tasted extremely fresh and homemade - nothing processed. Somehow they even managed to make the French fries with the kids entree taste superior to all other fries.  We also were happy to discover that we were on time for their Saturday Happy Hour special and ordered up the cocktail of the day: the black walnut old fashioned made with rum and black walnut bitters. It was strong but incredibly smooth. Changed the whole idea of old fashions for me.  Last but certainly not least, the service was excellent. Our server was very friendly, professional and on top of things. There was also several people who would come by to clear our empty plates and ask if we needed anything else.  It seemed very organized and like everyone was enjoying their work, which is something you don\u2019t always see.  Nice atmosphere, too. Even though it was busy, it was not too loud. And although we sat on the first floor, they have two big screen TVs upstairs that show scenes from the streets of Paris. We may request the second floor next time.  I highly recommend and we can\u2019t wait to go back.",

Our group had a nice sampling- chicken chasseur, bouillabaisse, steak frites, duck cassoulet and the fish of the day, branzino-all delish. Very accessible wine list, and of course, fab French desserts. We will all be going back again-soon!",

The room is wonderful, warm and inviting, and the service was excellent. Unfortunately, the food was a complete let down. The cassoulet was served in a warmish cast-iron container, but the contents were barely room temperature, and didn't taste remotely like a proper French cassoulet. The gnocchi are French style, and therefore different than usual Italian, and were described as being fluffy. Instead of fluffy and light, they were gummy and undercooked, and incredibly salty. Obviously, someone did not taste this in the kitchen. We enjoyed the wine, which is thoughtfully selected, and the chocolate mousse was delicious, and a good vehicle to make you hyperactive.  Since it's easy to spend $200 for two, I don't think we'll be returning soon.",

As someone with over 30 years hospitality industry background, I can be a tough customer who notices everything, so I'm particularly thrilled will Le Sud. We didn't have a reservation and weren't really dressed for a fine dining experience, but fortunately it was early on a Wednesday night, so we had no issues getting a table. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming and accommodating. Friendly hostess; great waiter (Sean); amazing cocktails. (both Sean and two additional servers brought our drinks and helped clear our table. Great teamwork!); Food Runner was friendly and professional and made sure to crumb our table before marking us between courses. INCREDIBLE FOOD -- Grilled Octopus starter was fork tender. Scallops were beautifully  caramelized and both apps had numerous delicious and complex complimentary components; Bouillabaisse was a show stopper; Brown Butter Ice Cream was rich and intense. Definitely will return. Thanks!",

But since the new Chef has taken over things have changed and not really for the better. Last night was the second time under his stewardship and we felt that his tweaks to the menu that made the restaurant a hit, are misses. The flavors over power each other on the duck, and the steak frites has become pedestrian. We realize things change and menu items come and go in order to maintain the edge in the industry, but it seems like the subtle balance originally achieved here has been broken. Service is still excellent but the Management is different. Unfortunately we're going to have to wait out the changes for a while, hopefully it's just growing pains.  Excellent Restaurant in the heart of Roscoe village. From the Friendly greeters to the knowledgeable waitstaff, you'd think this place had been open for many years, but in a short time they have themselves a well oiled machine. We started with the charcuterie and salad and had Duck and Steak frites for our main meal. A tour of the French red wines by the glass accompanied our meals. I finished with a classic cocktail and my partner had some handmade gelato. Excellent spot for a date, or dinner with friends. Can't wait to go back.",

When a table became available we waited for another 30 minutes at which point we flagged down a waiter to see what happened to our food order (made > 1 hr before). He then informed us that it was never started.  I haven't really ever had problems with service before but we ended up waiting almost 2 hrs before actually receiving our food which felt longer than acceptable.

Overall, we left satisfied, and took plenty of photos (see attachments). However, we are on the fence on whether or not we would return again in the future.  First of all, we noticed that menu items on their website (specifically the bouillabaisse) was not on the menu at the restaurant. Nevertheless, we moved forward, and ordered appetizers: Seasonal cheese plate, Spanish octopus, and Ni\u00e7oise Tartine (marinaded grilled tuna). The octopus was outstanding, the tuna good, however one of the cheeses (Scottish cheddar) had a strong mold-like taste. One server was kind to provide us with an extra slice of the creamy blue cheese, which was delectable.  For the main courses, we had the pan-roasted duck breast and the Mussels Proven\u00e7al. The duck was flavorful, but chewy and fatty. The mussels dish was good, but was supposed to include prawns as per the menu description. Not sure why they were left off. Also the broth was a bit too salty to drink alone without the toasted bread.  The Cabernet ordered was silky, refreshing, and left the palate begging for more. But that was the problem (see photo). They poured so little of it and still charged $11. One has to wonder if this was an adequate \u201cserving\u201d.  During the evening, the service was phenomenal. You really had the impression the people working there were focused on taking care of you. Water glasses were filled promptly, and the dishes came out in a timely manner. That said, we only wished they offered better in terms of food and drink to bring us back.",

Great addition to the neighborhood and hopefully we will go again. We got a reservation and would suggest that especially with it being new.  Only one suggestion to them, kids burger for my son the top bun is a little thick for a kid to eat effectively. I took a bite and it was great tasting so it\u2019s just a little thing. You can\u2019t go wrong with scallops, pork chop, duck, or the vanilla maple ice cream.",

We had to wait a few minutes for our table, which was fine. For food, we had croquettes and a baguette to start. Scallops, the duck, and french fries for the main. And the Basque cake for dessert. We enjoyed all of it and would recommend those dishes.  For service, our water glasses were always filled and we generally didn't have a hard time getting our waiter's attention. I was most impressed when he immediately brought the wine list when our entrees came (we made a comment earlier that we'd switch to wine). I appreciate that we didn't even have to ask. And about a minute after that the manager walked by and asked if we knew what we wanted. He saw my dish and immediately gave me two recommendations and then brought me a taste of each of them without me asking.  While I live in walking distance to the restaurant I thought it was good enough that it would bring me to Roscoe Village if I didn't live here. I already have reservations to come back in a month for a family celebration.",

This got my palette going. The foie gras was arguably the best I ever had. Even if you don't like liver, try it. You will love it. On to the octopus salad. Tender and loaded with flavor. The French fries finished off my dinner. I was full and satisfied. I enjoyed a wonderful Cabernet.  I look forward to going back with my wife so we can share some large plates. I finished everything with a cognac infused wine, recommended by the bartender. All this for less than $60. You can't go wrong. Enjoy.",

The lavender glazed duck was so good I wanted to lick the plate. I can be picky, especially with duck and it was great. The wine list was nice, I had a delightful pairing offered to me by Mark, our server, who I've worked with in the past and who kept introducing me to everyone who worked there, including the owner who was incredibly sweet. I used to live next door to the woman who baked all of their bread- in house and I had previously worked with the management team. So many worlds collidided to make me feel right at home with some delicious contemporary French food in a very intimate and homestyle setting. Dessert was good; I enjoyed the cookies that came with the ice cream the most and was glad there were some gluten free options for others.  It did get quite loud being primetime on a Saturday night, although I didn't quite mind. We were on the second floor, so I'd imagine being on the first floor and/or going earlier/later in the night would be more manageable if the noise bothers you or you are hoping to have long conversation.  It was a great experience, the food was delicious and the service was excellent,  especially for how busy they were. The staff were all friendly and other guests seemed to be enjoying themselves as much as we were. I look forward to going back.",

The customer service was top notch. Our waitress was amazing. She helped us navigate the menu. So many exotic flavors & so healthy! We started with bread and olive oil with herbs along with the Shrimp appetizer. The shrimps are hearty-sized and were perfectly seasoned. I would highly recommend these to start. Then we shared the roasted brussels sprouts, roasted carrots, and seared pumpkin fregola. The taste of all these dishes were so flavorful and so satisfying. They took some of my favorite dishes to the next level. The manager, Noel was very accommodating and helped us pick dessert. The Basque Cake was divine and different from any other dessert I have ever tasted in my life! I know I will be coming back because the exotic flavors and their taste set the crave. A great experience of local French cuisine overall. Magnifique!",
