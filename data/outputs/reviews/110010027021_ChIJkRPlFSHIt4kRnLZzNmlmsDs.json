The waitress seemed like she was trying to sell us plates instead of simply serving. I talked to a couple friends who were also very underwhelmed by their experience here. The interior design is nice to look at but not comfortable to be in because the seating is very hard wood with no cushions. The cheese appetizer was very good but the vegetarian platter was unsatisfying as a main dish. It's also served with minuscule flatbread. We had to go home and order pizza after this. My friend ordered a dish with fish, so more protein, but it still didn't fill her up.",

Their menu includes numerous authentic, and many inspired dishes that combine multiple flavors into a very balanced and fulfilling experience. It's easy for a restaurant to get savory, sweet, bitter, and other palettes right. It's much more difficult to combine or contrast flavors, and even more difficult to match them and bring the dish to the next level. That's what this food is, next level. It has been a consistently positive experience every time we come. The service is attentive and warm. The atmosphere, welcoming and restrained. It's a small place, but it's easy to get lost and let the hours go by. Their regular menu is reasonably priced, especially for the quality of the food you receive and their happy hour is a steal. Regardless of time or day, I'd recommend you to go and experience some of the best food, and best restaurants in the District.",

Not only was our server Jessica extremely professional and helpful when describing dishes I had never tried but the help she received from her colleague from the bar was awesome. Constant attention to customers, without being to intrusive. The food was spectacular. Everything we tried was amazing and fresh. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The only complaint I had was I was not able to try the entire menu due to my stomach not being big enough! Will definitely be back to try more of the dishes. Oh and to top it off they received a bib gourmand! I have no affiliation to this place but highly recommend the community support Mola and the staff there. Almost forgot about the wine, 10/10 would buy another bottle. You will not be disappointed!",

All the food is lovingly hand cooked and presented. The ham croquetas were incredible, hot and golden just salty enough and resting in a wonderful green sauce. The Torrijas (cinnamon & orange flavoured French toast with orange blossom honey) was mouth-wateringly delicious and the Fried Goat Cheese with orange-blossom honey & dried plums was other-worldly.

        "caption": "After dining at Nido's and now Mola, I think I know what it takes to open a successful restaurant: 1) Focus on a small, fresh menu and master each dish creating art with food, 2) Cultivate an eye for design and lighting, 3) Train your staff in being pleasant, putting diners at ease, and 4) Ask for feedback along the way. The owners of Mola can teach a class on this.  Mola is a Spanish/Moroccan restaurant in Mount Pleasant NW. Once inside, you'll be greeted by a pleasant host before being seated in dining area. The design is simple, inviting, and their floral logo is genius. Fun fact: The owner, Carlos, made all the wooden furniture himself.  There's a full bar in the back and to the left of the bar is a five person \"bar nook.\" They intentionally don't have heavy alcohol cocktails but rather offer more light drinks like the Tinto de Verano (red wine and limonata).  Their menu has fourteen items on it ranging from snacks to a large pot of paella. It's simple but that only means they have perfected each dish. We (my wife and I) ordered one snack sized dish, two medium dishes and the paella and we were satisfied. Here's what we ordered that we will have us running back for:  1) Pork, sausage, chickpea, and spinach paella: It comes in a large pot perfectly fried with the best oil. They make sure they slightly burn the rice on the bottom giving you an extra treat. Truly, the flavors are perfect.  2) Fried goat cheese with honey and beer chips.  3) Sherried artichokes with egg, herbs and pine nut sauce: The artichoke is perfectly cooked and never chewy.  We didn't get dessert, but we hear it's amazing so we'll be back!",
