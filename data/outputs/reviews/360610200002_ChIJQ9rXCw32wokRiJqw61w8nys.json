Not sure if that makes sense. The flavors were there but it wasn\u2019t enticing. Also I ordered a salmon clay pot and they put tomatoes in it which made the sauce more acidic then needed. Lastly, the place was freezing. We had to ask for the doors to be closed to which a gentlemen\u2019s looked annoyed that we even asked. Lastly we had a \u201cmoms recipe dessert\u201d it was just too much chocolate and additives. Not enjoyable. Our total price was $130.00 for a party of 2 and I left hungry and unimpressed. I will not be going back.",

Fortunately it was only for renovations. The newly renovated decor was intricate and elegant, a combination of Eastern and traditional. This is a great date night location. They did social distancing barriers and masks required. Service was impeccable and the waitress was very attentive and gave good suggestions for my dinner partner who has a multitude of sensitivities and allergies. She ended up with the Hari Mirch Ricotta and the Lamb. She loved both, which were perfectly seasoned. The lamb had rareness choices and was nice and moist. She was offered samples of her drink order to make sure that it was a good choice and did not have any additives. I chose the samosas and the Vegetable Curry with Naan. The samosas were seasoned but not too spicy with a crispy pastry. The Curry was the right amount of spicy, (I usually have to add, not this time) and the vegetables were crisp and fresh. Dessert was a whole other world. I chose  Alice's Rum pudding. I don't typically like pudding, but this was a delicious relative of Tirimisu. The rum flavor was present up front, with a mixture of cream and nuts that was amazing. I added vanilla ice cream and it wss complete dessert heaven. The Chai was authentic and there wasn't a need to add anything. All in all a great dinner, with great service, reasonably priced, and close to home. Highly recommended.",

The string lights and the intimate-looking front patio made me want to go in, so I checked out the menu and was happy to see that they had vegetarian options that sounded as equally good as their meat and fish options. Also, the music was great and added to the chill vibe of the place.  The hostess and servers were patient, attentive, and professional, though it did take a little long to get served in the beginning. I felt comfortable with the precautions they were taking re: COVID. They took my temperature, cleaned my table in front of me, and gave me my own paper menu that I could dispose or take home with me. The patio was divided with tables well spaced and blocked off from one another, and they also had an outdoor space in the back where people could sit.  I had the kale burger (you can get it wrapped in lettuce for a vegan option). The patty didn't have the consistency of meat; it was its own thing, and it was so so good. I could definitely taste the Indian influence in the spices, and everything combined to make a strong but smooth and savory flavor profile. I also got the okra fries with my burger, which were phenomenal. The house ketchup and spicy mayo were distinct and so delicious I ordered more to go.  I also tried the samosas, which were good, and the Indiarita cocktail, which was spicy, sweet, smoky, and just delicious. For desert I had the rum pudding, which came in a large portion and was very good, but very rich. I could only eat a couple bites of it. I would definitely recommend sharing this desert with another person, or taking it home if you can't finish it. Overall, I had a great experience and would 100% recommend this place. One of the best restaurants I've been to in Harlem!  Edit: went back here with a friend and we tried their salmon burger and lamb chops. The meat and fish were well cooked and very well seasoned, the flavors distinct. Would definitely recommend these dishes for meat and fish lovers.",

Service was poor.  Update:  My friend and I revisited Chaiwali on  10/30 and the staff and owners were very apologetic to what happened our last vist. They also honored us with free kale burgers which were AMAZING!  So worth the double wait!! The kale burger actually tasted better than I remembered, tasty n slighty spicy with fresh avocado....so good. Chaiwali is definitely an experience; so beautifully and thoughtfully designed and the food is really great.  I am so happy we went back and they took great care of us this visit. We will certainly be back.  Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

Each dish had enough personal touch from Chef Trehan bettering any Michelin starred offering you get in the lower part of town, but more sophisticated than any normal Indian fare. As a starter we had the Hari Mirch Ricotta (Indian Green Chili Ricotta), which had an unexpected kick much to the delight of my wife who is a fan of spice.  The star of the night was the Velvet Carrot Butter chicken - one of the best takes on this dish I\u2019ve had anywhere in the world, including its spiritual hometown of New Delhi.  We paired the dish with Naan and a garlic naan, both of which were surprisingly \u2026 normal. For dessert we had the Rum Pudding, which is the best piece of Anglo-Indian cuisine I\u2019ve had on this side of the pond.  The drinks \u2013 the Delhi Gymkhana Martini (served with bits of Gold leaf), and Ah Na Nas \u2013 were good, but not to the class of the food.  The service was phenomenal, with staff holding the line between attentive while not being pushy. The manager, Natalie, did a great job of making us feel welcome and ensured that we come back for brunch at this awesome establishment.  Best of luck to (the awesomely named) Chaiwali!",

I arrived around 5pm Wed. eve which at that time it was very empty with the exception of 3 other persons being there and so I was expecting a lot of attention. The decor of this restaurant was very beautiful in every area and clean. The service was not exceptional (energy was flat), I had to ask my waiter what was his name halfway through his service. Now what i'm about to write is the honest truth! I ordered the house chai, Masala fish & Quinoa. My chai came in a metal cup(I thought to myself, maybe this is their style) I didn't enjoyed it, then my entree arrived and when I saw it, the first thing that came to my mind was frozen fish from BJ and I had to ask my waiter if it is fresh....(it was fresh),then the Quinoa came in a metal bowl. Seriously, I did not appreciate paying over $30 for a meal and get served in metals. The food was flavorful but there was something deeply missing which I can't figure out. My expectation was very high and that expectation was not met. My food wasn't satisfying. I will not be returning.  Bonus: after being there for an hour only 5 other persons came in the restaurant and I was shock to see that all the other restaurants in the neighborhood were filled and full of life as I toured the area.",

The naan (4$)was terrible and tasted like pita bread. I overheard they outsourced the naan to keep it non gmo but an Indian restaurant that cannot make a decent naan to me is red flag. The kale burger (16$)was good, but I found it to be flavored with way too much onion and garlic. The place is very cute, but it is obviously indian food for the general fusion public. The service was super slow, and disfanctional , lots of staff standing around  doing nothing , and only one server for too many tables. I really wanted to like this place!",

Food is impeccible, music selection perfection, decro  breathtaking. If you haven't had the privilege of visiting, it's time you do!
