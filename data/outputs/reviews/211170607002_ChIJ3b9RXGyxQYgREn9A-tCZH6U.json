It really sets the tone here as very cozy and inclusive.  The food orders are always ran through down to the last detail requested prior to leaving the kitchen by staff with the customer/delivery driver. Accuracy is always a priority here and the food is always made to order so it's always hot and fresh.  Each time I am here EVERY employee has a facemask on - properly. They also have hand sanitizer and are following all local and CDC guidelines.  Perfect location! Easy to find with quick access to the highway.  Parking is no problem either.  Can't wait to see you there!",
