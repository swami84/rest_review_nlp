What I didn\u2019t expect was the result of a nice renovation which consisted of beautiful Mediterranean styled tile work laid intricately on the floor.  I may be mistaken, but I can almost see the light touch of designer Zoe Feldman in the decision to move the soda refrigerator from its previous perch to its new location about 5 feet away on the adjacent wall.  Seemingly small changes that contributed to an almost electric atmosphere.  Few locations allow the opportunity to rub shoulders with drunk college students, police officers, Architect of the Capitol employees, Hill staffers, and whatever it is I am.  But, Boli\u2019s offers all of that as well as a slice of cheese pizza lovingly packaged in a delightfully colored box along with a can of ginger ale for the measly sum of $5.00.",

Order arrives after abut 40 minutes, I tip the driver 5 bucks i glance at the order i tell the driver the order is wrong i didnt see any buffalo wings only cajun he assured me the order was right the buffalo wings were on the bottom. I get back upstairs to the lunch room open up the container all dried up Cajun wings with one ranch dressing no buffalo wings no blue cheese. I called the driver back and let him know. He informed me he would immediately bring back a new correct order that was hot. I wait around for 25 minutes, lunch break is over. They call back saying the driver is downstairs he has with him two blue cheeses and a little container of buffalo sauce. I guess i was suppose to pour cold buffalo sauce over CAJUN wings, which are damn near frozen by now. hummmy cold Cajun wings with cold buffalo sauce. Worst customer service ever, obviously this manager is clueless about what customer service is. Get the order right the first time if your to stingy to cook more wings and bring them back out. NEVER AGAIN!!!! only the second negative review i have written in my life I couldnt let this slide...the worst. I ate three wings and threw the rest in the trash. 20 bucks including tip down the drain. The worst.",
