        "caption": "Ever since my favorite fish restaurant closed, I\u2019ve been searching for a replacement.  I\u2019ve heard good reviews about Make My Fish and decided to give it a try.  When I arrived to the restaurant it was a bit crowded which I took as a good sign.  The staff member taking the orders did so quickly, I waited less than 5 minutes to  place my order.  The staff member who took my order was very polite and professional.  It took me less than 10 minutes to receive my order.  I was pleased with the fast service.  While waiting on my food I noticed a staff member stepped outside.  He then came in and used hand sanitizer than put on gloves and got right back to work.  Make sure you have cash on you because the restaurant only accepts cash.   There is an ATM in the restaurant as well in case you don\u2019t have cash on you.  I ordered the whiting fish dinner with baked macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and candied yams.  I appreciated getting actual whiting fish as some places say they have whiting but gives tilapia instead.  There were about 7 pieces of fish.  The fish was filet in which I love because I don\u2019t have the time or energy to pick through bones.  The fish was seasoned with too much black pepper, I\u2019m not a black pepper fan as I think it\u2019s too spicy for me.  My mom loves her food with lots of black pepper and she even said it was too much black pepper for her.  The yams were bland, too hard and crunchy, they weren\u2019t cooked long enough.   The macaroni and cheese had a weird taste to it was very bland.   The collard greens the best side out of the three.  It was cooked well and had a lot of flavor to them.  Out of 5 stars, I would give: the food a 2\u00bd, customer service a 5, wait time a 5, overall rating would be a 2 because the wait time and service was pleasant.  I was hoping this would become one of my favorite spots after reading all the positive reviews.  However, I wouldn\u2019t return to the restaurant but give it a try you make like it.",

My only negative is that the \"catfish sandwich\" is just a regular order of catfish with two slices of sandwich bread. Just putting the fish on a bun with sauce would be amazing, but it's a little weird that the bread came in a ziploc bag. It was still incredible fish and I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for fried fish in Harlem. Also, the fried shrimp is on point as well.",

They guy he hugged had on gloves, hugged him back and continued fixing food for the customers without changing the gloves. The guy that came in with his coat on fixed himself 2 side dishes of Mac and cheese and collard greens, wrapped it up and started talking. The guy also was walking funny when asked why he said it was sciatica disc problems. When I did receive my food after about 28 minutes later, I did not like it. It didn't seem to be too seasoned. I ordered shrimp and fish along with clams. I got home and threw the majority of the food in the garbage. I traveled all the way from Queens. I will never go to Make My Fish on 116th again.",

The shrimp are xl and seasoned well too. Shrimp and Whiting combo gets you about 5-6 medium sized Whiting along with about 6 of the shrimp all of this for $16. The tartar sauce is even good. It adds to the flavor but never distracts from the flavor of the food.  If you ever went to a southern fish fry and enjoyed it-it's like that. There is a bit of a wait but you can call in your order too. They have mac and cheese, collards, candied yams.  All of the food is very very tasty. The staff is friendly and professional.  I wish they would  open a spot on the lower east side. We like fried fish too.  Lol.",

My BFF said he definitely enjoyed his dinner too. He had fish, mac & cheese and yams. We will definitely go back for fish and a sample of their cheese grits. I don't eat cheese grits, but honey it was really good. I definitely will be getting some to go with my fish the next time we go back.",
