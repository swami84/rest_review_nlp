They have an ok happy hour to get you started, but nothing that'll sustain you.  It's the usual rail drinks, select wine and beer.  They didn't have any food on the happy hour menu, that's always disappointing.  The waitress was really nice, and had lots to suggest for someone who hasn't been there before.  The Chicken Schnitzel was honestly one of the best chicken dishes I've had in a while.  Price wise, my part of the bill was $43 and included 2 happy hour drinks, 2 shared small plates, entree, and tip.  So the place isn't cheap but it isn't expensive either.  Overall, it was a pleasant surprise for a restaurant in NoMa and I'd go back, no issues.",

I had previously been charged $4 for the mocktails, which was a little steep; however, last time I went they wanted to charge me $54 for 4 mocktails. This is completely unreasonable and ridiculous. The bartender offered me a discount but made it clear they will cost more moving forward because it is fresh juice. I could go to Whole Foods and buy a gallon of fresh juice for $12. Most bars charge $2-3 for a mocktail. Overpriced, total ripoff. Taking my business elsewhere.",

I had teenagers, adults, vegetarians and meat enthusiasts.  Then I remembered that Carving Room NOMA (I had been to the original Carving Room many times) had just opened.  It's such a pleasure to know that everyone can find something on the menu and to see smiles on everyone's faces (we have a very picky group).  The vegetarians were enchanted by the earthy beet puree (with fresh bread!!) and the impossibly light and smooth ricotta cheese with a touch of honey.  We also had a tender and flavorful carrot salad. They finished off with a beautiful fresh tomato flatbread.  The meat eaters had a ribeye flat bread with a Harissa drizzle (mmmm...), and a burger that was absolutely insane.  It was impressive with a fluffy fresh baked bun, onion jam and came with crispy hot cumin fries.  We also had an order of crispy spiced meat cigars (think exotic egg rolls) which I remember from the original restaurant.  I'm so glad they serve them here!  The service was friendy and attentive without being intrusive.  I liked that food came out as it was ready.  We were all able to talk and share bites.  The owners (Oded and Rachel) even came by to check on our food and and were really kind!  They took the time out to  give some cooking advice to one of our teenagers that had questions. They chatted about making all the homemade sauces and were just natural hosts.  We all left pleasantly full and satisfied.  I'll be coming back to try their cocktails!  It looks like a great place for a date.  The bar looks very inviting!",

        "caption": "Highly disappointed by this one.  I live in the neighborhood, and saw that this place had opened up while I was walking by one night. The place looked fantastic, with a great ambiance, a very nice looking bar, and plenty of patrons. So my fiance and I decided to try it for lunch one day. We soon regretted our decision.  Upon arrival, there was a line out the door. We feared that we had shown up too late, and had been beaten by the midday lunch rush. As we got closer, we saw that the line was due to a logjam at the main podium, as soon as you walk in the door. Nearly all of the tables were still open.  Now normally, I assume a place with this sort of setup will have you take a seat, and then place your order with a waiter/server. Here, this was not the case, hence the long line out the door into the heat. You place your order and pay at the front podium, and then get a table number along with your receipt, which the servers then have to run around searching for the right number. It's a highly inefficient process, only helped today by the fact that there were not too many patrons there all at once.  Ordering at the podium was a chore. The hostess, or more seemingly the system was inefficient. We ordered an entree for each of us, and it took nearly a whole two minutes of the hostess tapping away at the touchscreen just to get the first item entered in.  My fiance ordered a chicken schnitzel sandwich, and I went with the CR Burger, thinking it would be difficult to mess those up. Upon ordering, I came to the shocking realization that the listing prices on the menu ($13 for both entrees) did not include ANY sides. Fries were extra, and thus I did not order any.  We proceeded to our seats, and waited for our food to arrive. In the meantime, we had water at the table to keep us occupied. I did go up to the bar and ask the bartender for a refill of water and some lemon. It was no trouble at all, but he carried himself as if I had just asked a tremendous burden of him. Not a great impression of service.  Service was generally lacking the entire visit. No one checked up on us for refills of water, no one asked us how our food was, and no one came to clear anything from the table. Just generally felt incredibly isolated, and a very cold experience. I've had far superior customer service interactions at my worst visits to a place like Nando's, which follows a similar dining model.  As to how the food was, the burger was thoroughly okay. It was cooked a good medium, had decent flavor, and the special mayo was a nice touch. However, the patty itself was incredibly underwhelming in terms of size, especially considering the price for it. I would have been better served with a burger from Five Guys, and paid far less, or equal with a side of fries.  As for the chicken schnitzel, it was disgusting. The chicken was of obviously very poor quality. Very tough and difficult to chew. Seasoning was okay, but overall just inedible. My fiance ended up eating the sandwich without the chicken on it. We both tried a small bite of the chicken, and I know the servers were looking at us as we did, and we made disgusted faces, but did anyone come over to ask us how we were? Nope! They all stood in the back in a circle on their phones.  We will not be back here. Not only was the food disappointingly mediocre at best, but it was incredibly overpriced, and the staff clearly do not care about the quality of the product, or their patrons, and that's a damn shame. A place like this, but of true quality, is a place that this neighborhood could really use, which makes this just more disappointing.",

        "caption": "Hopefully, it gets better but was charged extra for fries with the burger I ordered. The Happy Hour menu as of 6/20/2019 implied that the burger came with a choice or fries or salad. When the bill came, the waiter clarified that that wasn't the case. The waiter agreed that the menu was confusing.  The Happy Hour prices are not the best but aren't absurd either. If I go back, it will probably only go to drink in the future.  The rest of my party were very happy with the cocktails they ordered.  If you want a beer, I suggest going to Red Bear. If you want a burger, I suggest going up the few blocks to Five Guys.",

Cocktail was watery. Nice plates and atmosphere.  Charging for extra bread is insulting.  Servers had a generally smarmy attitude and didn\u2019t get our orders quite right, but that\u2019s to be expected at a new place.  I\u2019ll be back, maybe for happy hour when prices are more in line with quality and quantity, and will update my review if they fix their problems.",
