One of my parents' favorite places to eat, and the chefs come out and talk to their patrons, and even with masks on, they recognized them and all said hello, while giving away steak chili Mac to signal their reopening during Covid19 shutdown. They are happy to get their Patio Time back end of month!  Go support this fine dining establishment, keep our top quality restaurant around thru these shutdown periods, they could use your curbside, patio dining, or delivery services, as could us Grub Hub delivery drivers! We love this place, one and all!",

        "caption": "First, make a reservation. They were kind enough to seat us even though we didn't have one. The service was top notch, even had 2 different managers check in on us. When asked by them how everything was, we couldn't be liars, we told them the food was great because it truly was one of the best tasting steaks. Best part about the steaks is HW does NOT put any seasoning on their steaks. That tells me they don't want to ruin a great piece of meat. And might I suggest getting the spinach salad. Of course raw spinach tastes different than boiled, but there's a bacon dressing HW puts on it that's too good. Then there's boiled eggs, mushrooms, small pieces of onion, slices of radishes, croutons, and I'm sure I've missed more of the salad, but I could have had a whole meal just from that. We also ordered 2 sides. The green beans were excellent, they covered in some sort of garlic sauce. The other was the lobster mac and cheese, which wasn't the best I've ever had. It didn't seem to have enough lobster and the mac was bland. But to end on a positive note,  I'll say the bread that was brought to the table was also good, giving 3 choices of butter, a salted, an herb, and sweet butter that gets rotated out. On our visit it was a pumpkin spice, which I thought was pretty good. But overall, definitely worth every piece of 5 stars.",
