One of my parents' favorite places to eat, and the chefs come out and talk to their patrons, and even with masks on, they recognized them and all said hello, while giving away steak chili Mac to signal their reopening during Covid19 shutdown. They are happy to get their Patio Time back end of month!  Go support this fine dining establishment, keep our top quality restaurant around thru these shutdown periods, they could use your curbside, patio dining, or delivery services, as could us Grub Hub delivery drivers! We love this place, one and all!",

        "caption": "First, make a reservation. They were kind enough to seat us even though we didn't have one. The service was top notch, even had 2 different managers check in on us. When asked by them how everything was, we couldn't be liars, we told them the food was great because it truly was one of the best tasting steaks. Best part about the steaks is HW does NOT put any seasoning on their steaks. That tells me they don't want to ruin a great piece of meat. And might I suggest getting the spinach salad. Of course raw spinach tastes different than boiled, but there's a bacon dressing HW puts on it that's too good. Then there's boiled eggs, mushrooms, small pieces of onion, slices of radishes, croutons, and I'm sure I've missed more of the salad, but I could have had a whole meal just from that. We also ordered 2 sides. The green beans were excellent, they covered in some sort of garlic sauce. The other was the lobster mac and cheese, which wasn't the best I've ever had. It didn't seem to have enough lobster and the mac was bland. But to end on a positive note,  I'll say the bread that was brought to the table was also good, giving 3 choices of butter, a salted, an herb, and sweet butter that gets rotated out. On our visit it was a pumpkin spice, which I thought was pretty good. But overall, definitely worth every piece of 5 stars.",

I ordered a Sazerac out of curiosity, Lisa chose a select Kentucky Bourbon.  Both drinks were excellent and bartenders knowledgeable in their craft. Once seated, we ordered; fish, fillet mignon, 3 side vegetables and baked goat cheese w/roasted pepper with toasted bread as an appetizer. Lisa's fish was light delicate flavorful, my aged fillet was melt in your mouth tender. The vegetables were roasted, cooked yet crisp. This meal was by far one of the best meals we have had in the past 10 years. I enjoyed the surroundings, staff was attentive, if not a little stiff. Be aware, HW is a great dining experience, yet be prepared to pay for excellence. One star deducted for charging me for anchovies on my Caesar  salad.",

It took 1.5 Hours for us to be served our soup and salad, as we watched those who came in after us being served theirs and some even their entrees. It wasn\u2019t until after we received our soup that a manager came to speak with us and simply giggled and said \u201cWell, I hope the rest of your food is delicious\u201d. She then left and attended to other customers multiple times throughout the night, disregarding us. While our meals had already included dessert, their only offer to compensate for their service was more free dessert. We were overwhelmed with dessert and underwhelmed with the service. Overall would not recommend. While our server was great, the kitchen and other staff were unprepared. As a restaurant with steep prices, they should\u2019ve been better prepared on a fairly slow business night.",

The prime rib hash should be relabeled \u201cplate of potatoes with cheese and a few dried out pieces of meat, served warm after sitting under a light for a while hash\u201d.  Omelette served without advertised sides/ingredients. Not a huge deal if it hadn\u2019t cost $18.  Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e comes with complimentary hair, if that\u2019s your thing then definitely dig in. Looking at previous comments leads me to believe that someone there has a thing for putting hair in food.  The pancakes are big pieces of oversized goodness. I would eat these again. The hair issue has made me cautious though.  Management \u201ccared\u201d but not enough to make it right. No discounts, nothing, just a \u201chope to see you back\u201d and a removal of the hairy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e from the bill.  Again, save your money and time and go up the street a bit to Watson\u2019s, Destihl, Big Grove Tavern, etc.",

A touch more expensive than perhaps Google Maps let on, but you pay for rich, quality food. The establishment is not large, but doesn't feel tight. If there is a lull in the conversation, Big Band music can be heard unobtrusively in the background, however most of the Saturday night, the room was filled with laughter & genuine conversations. Surprisingly, I was probably on my phone the most (taking pictures of the food & writing this review), but others were thoroughly enjoying each other's conversations & presence. And I had a nearly equally  good time, delighting in the food, taking in a contemplative solitary supper & observing others. What a gem; I'll certainly return.",

I recently had the rack of lamb which was very well prepared (I did have to add salt), the crab cake (tasty and would get again), and the heirloom tomato tower (interesting dish that I would like to try again when tomatoes are actually in season). The prime rib, while prepared well, was under seasoned. I have had a few of their blue plate specials for lunch and these have always been great meals at a very reasonable price. The service I have never been impressed by, typically a bit slow with the entrees. Overall this is a good place to eat lunch and, if you want to have the Chicago steak experience, then dinner as well. It is definitely pricey (besides their blue plate specials) and I find that their sides and non-steak items are generally the best parts of the meal.",

After eating a couple, my girlfriend literally spit out a bite.  After trying some of the oyster that that came from it literally tasted rotten.  Then, our steaks came out and I ordered a filet, my girlfriends, a rib-eye.  My filet was completely under cooked in the middle and charred black on the outside.  I am a fan or medium rare meat but this was nearly raw on the inside.  I am not one who likes to send food back but I had to since I didn't want raw beef.  After it came back, It was even more charred on the outside to the point were the only taste I could notice was the one of burnt carbon.  Not to mention that they barely cooked it much more on the inside.  My girlfriend's rib-eye was sub-par.  It was a very thin cut, which does not leave any room to keep the center medium rare or get a good sear on the outside.  The only thing that was ok about the meal was the lobster tail I ordered on the side with my steak (which in all honesty is one of the easiest things to cook without messing it up).  I also failed to mention that the prices there were absurd.  For what was nearly a $150-200 meal for two, which was supposed to be a celebratory meal, this was absolutely THE MOST disappointing dining experience I have had in a long time, possibly ever.  I would never recommend this place to anyone and will certainly never go back under any circumstance.",
