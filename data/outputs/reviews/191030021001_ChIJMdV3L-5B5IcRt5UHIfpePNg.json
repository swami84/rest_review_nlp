Would definitely recommend more for dates than large groups.  The food was phenomenal. We got the Samosas as an appetizer and they were very tasty, a little spicy, and hot. My Dutch burger was cooked right, juicy, tender, and flavorful. The Gnocchi with Crab was also good, as I got to sneak a bite from my date. For dessert, the lemon poppy seed cake was very flavorful and well balanced. A nice little elegant dessert.  The homemade elements of each course were addressed by our waiter, who I believe was also the owner. I could really feel the love put into the recipes.  Drinks were good too, nothing too crazy complicated, but done right.  One of the best dining experiences I\u2019ve had in Iowa City!",

The menu now is more eclectic and interesting and includes several vegetarian and vegan options which is really cool. The owner Matthew is so passionate about his product and the care he puts in is evident. Kudos to him for soldiering on despite the COVID pandemic. This is a difficult time for fine dining establishments but he maintains an excellent experience. We had drinks including the mojito and gin rickey and they were incredible....fresh and sweet and tart\u2014just right. We had the vegetable samosas, made fresh in house and omg delightful! The mint chutney was amazing. All four in our party loved our entrees but the winners were the 126 burger (with house ground local beef and homemade brioche bun) and the ancho rubbed pork chop (tender and full of flavor with amazing Brussels sprouts on the side\u2014absolutely delicious). We ended with homemade sorbet and poppyseed cake and they were a perfect light ending to a delicious meal. To top it all off we had amazing, prompt, attentive service.  I think this little place is a treasure and a labor of love, and a visit will be well worth your time. Please support local fine dining establishments here and wherever your home town is...we don\u2019t want to lose the chance to sit and visit and take delight in amazing food like what is being offered over at one twenty six!",

Matthew even put together kids meals for our 2 and 4 year olds. Thoroughly enjoyable evening on a shady patio downtown. My SIL said he's never eating anywhere else in Iowa City.   Highly recommend!

This was our \"nice\" dinner while at the University Of Iowa attending continuing education classes.  I lived here for 11 years nearly 30 years ago, return every few years to attend class to maintain my dental license. Reservation was for 6:15 on Friday the 11th of October on a football weekend.  Arrived at 6:10, seated right away.  Water was brought and drinks were ordered.  Drinks served, and appetizers ordered, a cheese plate with three very good cheeses, dates, walnuts and perfectly toasted French bread.  We also had the marinated olives which complimented the cheeses very well. Order another glass of wine and dinner.  Wife ordered the steak frites medium and I the tenderloin medium it was complimented with whipped potatoes and broccolini.  Or I should say I think it was.  Original entree order was placed at approximately 6:30-6:35 also ordered the bread basket (it's not complementary) bread came just a few minutes later.  At 7:20 our young lady server brings two simple dinner salads explaining that another server had inexplicably taken our order to another table.  Please accept these salads and of course the wine is also on us. Salads, simply greens with a nice vinaigrette.  No bread left but that's fine.  The trek to the bathrooms go directly by open kitchen up a long flight of stairs. After the salads went to the bathroom up the very tall stairs for the second time we've been here nearly 1 1/2 hours with cheese and bread and wine........ coming down the stairs there is NOTHING on the grill? Get to the table there is still no food. It's almost 8:00pm.  Olives, bread, drinks (the cocktail not the wine she said was comped) cheese.  We decided to put $40 cash on the table and left.   We did briefly say we had to leave, to our waitress as she stood running another patrons tab. We told her we had left some $ on the table and she just smiles and says oh really?  Then we went to find food.  I would have thought when our order was found to be lost every effort to bring our dishes as quickly as possible would have been afforded.  Or at the very least kept updated. Nothing no communication after the salads were given.  We ended up at 8:15 pm trying to find a place to eat on a football weekend in Iowa City.  So disappointed.",

The desserts were delicious. They have an extensive wine selection and a full bar but no cocktail menu.",

As I entered the dungeon, I felt as if I was in an alley between two really high ancient brick buildings cause that's what the walls of this place were: just solid raw brick, no paint, dark, simple wood tables, no decorations of any kind. A very tall, slender, guy approached me. He greeted me. I asked him for a menu. He explained they were no longer serving their lunch specials and that I was there at kind of an odd time. I told him that I just wanted something that \"tasted good\" that was \"filling\". He said, \"I got just the thing for you. It's a sandwich we make called Cuban Pork\". I said, \"I'll take it\". He said, \"Would you like any fries with it?\" I said, \"Yes\". He asked me where I'd like to sit and suggested that it would be nice to sit outside cause it was a nice day. I smiled and said that I'd rather sit next to the open window. He grinned broadly and said wherever you'd like. He didn't ask me if I'd like anything to drink, but said he'd bring water. I hate water, but I didn't say anything. He brought the water. It was in a nice large very clean looking glass. I took a sip half expecting to taste chemicals (city water). I didn't. I actually liked the water. He brought my food. I don't really like pork too well, but if someone says something is good, I just get it. The Cuban Pork was so awesome that it was out of this world. Wow, I thought. I wasn't too impressed by the fries, but I'm not really a frie person anyway. You'll just have to try them yourself. The fries came with ketchup, but I hate ketchup, so I asked if they had any hot sauce. He said they had Sriracha. I said that's even better. The meal was a good portion of food and it costed under $15. I was real impressed by my waiter though. He was a very nice guy with a very friendly smile. Another guy from the back even said hi and gave me a wave. They make you feel like you're home at this place, so I gave him a $3 tip for the hospitality, and the really awesome sandwich. You're probably thinking, \"Then why not 5-stars?\" Cause I wasn't crazy about the fries. Poor excuse, I know, but I'm very very picky about what I eat. I highly recommend this place though. All my 4-star and 5-star reviews are worthy places. Stars are just what my personal experience was, but yours may be better. Not everyone is going to have the same experience. Try this place out today.",

The food was decent, but expensive. Lunch for one person cost $25.20. This price was for an open-faced chicken sandwich, salad, and iced tea. A 20% tip was automatically added. I noticed that the alcoholic drink menu is also very expensive, with a glass of beer $7 on up. You must climb steep stairs to get to the dining area.",

Mistakes happen at restaurants, and I\u2019m understanding when food takes an extra long time or you deliver the wrong food.  When my girlfriend and I were at Moonrakers, one of our plates had been delivered to another man first who began eating from it.  When he realized his order was wrong, that exact plate with his used condiments was delivered to me.  This is beyond a simple mistake, and dangerous if it\u2019s not also a violation of health code.  No amount of being busy makes this a reasonable or acceptable way to do business.  Now I\u2019m wondering if my girlfriend is sick because Moonrakers gave her the fries that someone else had started eating already.  They didn\u2019t acknowledge that our food had already been picked at until we said something, and then we got to wait another 45 minutes on top of our long original long wait for food.  I have to advise steering clear of a place that\u2019s so wantonly reckless with their approach to their customers\u2019 health.",

They brought out several appetizer pizzas (margherita and bacon-onion) which were crispy and delicious. The salad was a good mix of field greens (no cheap iceberg) and, while listed to come with balsamic vinaigrette, came with a surprisingly good and slightly spicy tomatillo dressing. They brought out plates of fries for tables to share, which were fresh and crisp. For the main course, I got the local grass fed burger with bacon. The meat was probably the best on a hamburger I've had in ages, and came medium rare, as requested. The bun was good, but they slathered mayonnaise on the top half (not indicated by the menu) so the top half was left to waste. I had the chocolate torte-like desert with raspberry sauce, which was rich and delicious. Only complaint I can come up with was the mayo on the bun.",

The chardonnay we received was flat, obviously from a bottle that had been open for a while. We ordered a burger and curry wrap, both with fries which were limp as soon as we received them. The burger was fine (it's hard to botch organic beef on a house-made bun) but oversalted. The curry wrap, however, was essentially Spanish rice in a tortilla, lacking heavily in curry and virtually absent of vegetables (if there were any, perhaps they were minced and included in the tomato sauce). Simply put, it was not a proper curry and very disappointing.  The place has a nice look overall, but this is hampered by glaring lights, muted big screen TVs, and high volume coming from the bar TV.  Our service was efficient but cold. The menu specifically states that burgers are prepared as per the customer's request, but I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger.  One could easily find a random establishment that provides better bar food than what we received here, or at least know to deliver crisp fries. Having both worked in food service, we know what we received was unacceptable.  The bottom line: The quality didn't live up to the prices. We would never go there again, or bother to try Hearth or One Twenty Six, which are at a higher price range.",
