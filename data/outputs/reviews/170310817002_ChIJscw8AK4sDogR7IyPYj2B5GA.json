On Friday, March 19, I again called the restaurant and spoke with an employee to inquire whether a special dietary request could be accommodated. I was assured it could. On Saturday, March 20,2021, at 7:00pm,  my wife, our  two friends and I approached the restaurant and found the door locked, the lights off, and no one answering the phone. Other prospective diners were also standing on the street, visibly agitated -as none of us had received even the courtesy of a text message to inform us of the unscheduled closing. Consequently, we were necessitated to leave and find an alternate choice: on a Saturday night, at 7:00pm, during Restaurant week, and amid a throng of diners responding to the relaxation of Covid restrictions. Obviously, despite having frequently patronized this restaurant in the past, we will never return-nor will our companions, who regaled us with stories of this restaurant\u2019s owner\u2019s past history of questionable business practices, as we dined at another restaurant several hours later that evening. These people do not DESERVE to remain in business.",

All we received was a small container with seven small pieces of butter chicken (lots of sauce), what looked like a spoonful of rice (not even enough for one), a small portion of fruit, two small arepas, and two types of naan. The food was good, but the amount of chicken was definitely not enough for two people!  ...especially for $78...  I thought they would\u2019ve, at least, sent two orders of the butter chicken.  After calling the restaurant, the woman told me she was sure that amount was correct, but that a manager would call me back. No one called. When I tried to call back today, I can\u2019t even get through. It goes to voicemail - all three times. I definitely will not be going back to this restaurant, and am disappointed with the service.",

I was there for 35 minutes just to be asked if they took my order. I work in the industry and understand when a place is bad understaff but this place really did not do much to provide us with any normal type of service. A restaurant managed like this does not deserve my business. I read reviews and always want to give places benefit of the doubt but I seen similar reviews that date back months. What a waste of time and having to drive and pay for parking for a night out as out first restaurant week on the list place. Cost me more for the trip and wait time for nothing. Hoping at least the food is awesome cause menus sound amazing but I would give this place 0 stars . I felt bad writing this review being a chef but I'm also a customer. And I read over other reviews and this seems to be a very common trend with late food and bad servers. I do not recommend and would not even want to go back if the meals were free and paid vacation.",

The achari chicken was served without its accompaniment. I requested for it. The server said she would get it. But there was no sign of her for several minutes and the accompaniment was not served eventually. They charged us for an item that was not ordered by us. When we asked the server to get the check corrected, she kept us waiting for so long and came back asking us what we were waiting for !! She basically forgot to even get the check corrected. The food quality was below average, especially the butter paneer which had a watery texture. Overall a horrible experience.",

The dishes reflect the vibrancy & intimacy of the flavors present in both cultures, with specific nods to each individually as well.  They are taking the utmost care as far as sanitation & health/safety are concerned. Everything sanitized, barriers between tables, staff is tested for COVID EVERY WEEK, which is even more than I can say for some folks I know in medical professions right now. Sounds like they will have outdoor heaters & air purifiers soon as well for the colder months ahead.  Overall, really conscientious staff as well. Beautifully redone interior & diverse menu. Definitely 5 stars. Best birthday dinner I've had in a long time, and that's saying something in 2020!!!",

The appetizers and complimentary naan and fries were great. My friends and I all had the mutton (goat). It was okay, but my mind was probably made up due to me being Jamaican and growing up eating curry goat. The dessert was not tasty at all. However, my biggest complaint about the restaurant would be their portion sizes. I would call this place a tapas bar. I see it more for tasting/sampling foods, rather than going for an entree. So I also thought that it was extremely overpriced. However, the presentation of the food was beautiful.",

My second visit was last weekend. Ours was the only party dining at 7:00pm on a Saturday evening - it was odd, and perhaps a bit sad to have the place all to ourselves.  Our server apologized for not being able to accommodate two of our selections (they ran out of batter, apparently). The entre\u00e8s we ordered lacked a balance of flavors, and had a stale but just heated quality.  A disappointing dining experience. On the slightly bright side, the Farrokh Chotia black and white photographs on the walls still exude a sensual vibe.",

We were a party of 5, so not that difficult to accomodate. It seemed like we were being punished for showing up early!! We even contemplated going to another restaurant, but since we did not have reservations, we stayed. The food is a fusion of India and Latin America. The food is a bit of a hit and miss. Some of the dishes were absolutely great, while some kept you wondering on the taste. The portions for the appetizers and the main course were small, so you really could not have a second chance at tasting if you could not figure out the taste! Some of the items on the menu were not available. We were told that they were \"out\" of some of the items on the menu as it had been a busy day. We had reservation for 9 pm (showed up at 8:40 pm). I have never heard that from a restaurant before, and that too for wines as well. I am told that there are a number of options in Chicago for Indian food. Maybe we should have stuck to a more authentic Indian restaurant. Not sure if I will revisit this place if I am in Chicago again, purely because of the attitude of the staff. Overall we did not have a great experience at Vermilion. Stick to more authentic Indian or Latin American restaurants, and there are plenty of these in Chicago,  unless you want to be treated as trash.",

I don't write any reviews online but I'm forced to considering the money we spent: nearly $900 (yes, nine hundred US dollars) for what I think is HANDS DOWN the WORST FOOD in ENTIRE NORTH AMERICA in my last 10 years of business travel. This is nothing more than a well decorated place with a fancy name. All the appetizers served to us were cold that made us wonder if they were ordering food from another restaurant. The main course were served so late that some of the colleagues had already left. All the food served were tasteless, had no flavor whatsoever, half-cooked, breads so hard and what not... absolutely horrible. They food was served in a themed dish but does anyone care if they taste so bad? I have called the restaurant to share my grievance; they took my number and promised to call back to discuss but never they did.

Was served water in a glass that was clearly not clean (large residue from some other beverage on the glass). Stayed, assuming it was just a mistake.  Waiters did not write down our orders and came back several times asking us questions about what we ordered. Assumed the waiter was new and tried to enjoy my night.  Was served the wrong food - served me a different meal than what I ordered, charged me for it, and then asked if I wanted to switch.  After I paid, my credit card was not returned until I personally asked for it (it was on floor of the kitchen).  Never ever go here. The worst service ever. I should have not even paid.",

The organizer outsourced the contract to a 3rd party who owned the DJ and coat check. The restaurant still owned the drinks (bar) and food. Both the sides had no sync and the customers were at a loss as to where to go and what to do.  DJ was pathetic who played pre-recorded Bollywood remixes from YouTube. Speakers blasted our ears coz the acoustics of the dance room was horrible (well that's what it happens when a restaurant tries to earn some extra bucks in new year by arranging a DJ night which they got no clue how to pull it off). Started off by 11:35 when all the other clubs were playing at their peak. Announced the NY late by 3 mins and the countdown didn't sounded energetic anyways.  Didn't ate any food but the bar service sucked big time. A single order of beer took 15 mins and there was a line waiting for their orders. Beer wasn't even chilled, figured they didn't had time to put them in freezer yet wanted to bluff customers by telling them it's chilled.  The cherry on the cake was the event organizer misbehaving with my friend and threatening him on calling cops and throwing him out when he simply complained on bad music, delay in food service, poor quality of sound and lighting error.  Overall 1 star just for the masala fries. Failed attempt of arranging such event. I wouldn't go back to this place even for dine-in.",

This was advertised as a club level event and even the lights were not turned down. The music, again by the same person, was monotone and were not dance numbers. You dare to call yourself a DJ but playing copies YouTube tunes and full Bollywood numbers doesn\u2019t make you one. Event started late.  Vermillion , you advertise yourself as a classy restaurant, but this was nothing but a third rate and pathetic representation of your values in the form of this event.  I liked the fries!!",

When we got there around 8:30 on a saturday night the place was almost empty.  The server was extremely friendly and gave us great tips for ordering from a menu that looked a little strange to us coz of the all the weird fusion stuff going on. So we were off to a good start.  For drinks we had a lychee ginger martini, a cucumber mint martini and mango mint mohito. The drinks were definitely top-notch and extremely delicious!!! So 5 stars there for sure!  For the appetizers we shared the \"degustation of  4 appetizers\" which includes about two bites of 4 different dishes that the chef chooses. On this day there was a duck appetizer, which neither of us are fans of, so we got the chicken doubled  and we had two other different vegetarian dishes. One was pani puri and the other was artichoke something. These were all awesome!  The main course is where things started to go downhill. We ordered butter chicken and the goat mutton. The butter chicken was great, but lets get real, butter chicken is very hard to screw up (even if you try it at home, its pretty easy. Takes forever, but still easy). The goat mutton was not so great. It was way too spicy (even for indians), some pieces of the mutton were overcooked, some were undercooked. Even the pieces that were nicely cooked were very unsatisfying. I ended up not eating most of it and just ate the butter chicken. Both these entrees came with naan, which was also extremely disappointing. It really didn't have that fresh naan feel or taste to it.  The dessert was the worst part. There was actually a chocolate cake on the menu with some type of chili masala. Are you kidding me???? More spice? I think by the time we get to the dessert most people have had enough spice. None of the other items on the menu looked appealing at all. Once look at the dessert menu and we just asked for the check.  Even without the dessert, we had spent wayyy too much money. I dont think we would come back here. Definitely not with a group, coz you'll end up paying a small fortune to feed more than 4 people. Its a nice place if you want to try something new. But if you're going here to satisfy your craving for 'modern' indian food, you will probably leave unsatisfied. If you're from the suburbs its definitely NOT worth the trek downtown. There are much better options in the burbs, in every burb.  Heck, there are much better options downtown as well.",

On a Lollapalooza Saturday (potentially one of the busiest weekends for restaurants in Chicago) the restaurant had a many tables open which I thought was really odd. It took a while for us to get served, which made sense as there really was only two employees there! One waitress made our drinks and served everything while another employee was the chef and also helped serve food items. The restaurant was also silent... the only music or audio throughout was that of the conversations of the other dinner guests or the bass of rockit next door. All in all a very weird experience. The staff were courteous, but overall the food was just so so. The pani poori drink was cool in conception but after a few sips I couldn't finish it as the flavor profile was just too strong. I wouldn't come here again, unless chef/ownership changes.",

Interesting concept, \"fusion\" a combination of Indian and Latin flavors. Who knew they would complement each other so well!

I tried Vermilion after realizing fusion options in the River North area are kind of scarce, so that I could have a possible option for my guests who are interested in something different. While the menu at Vermilion is certainly out of the ordinary, I will never be sending any of my guests to this restaurant. Service was very much lacking. My waitress knew the menu very well but she wasn't friendly or inviting and she was not very attentive either.  The food was okay at best. I had their signature lobster portuguese & chimichurri new york strip surf and turf. The lobster was disgusting. It was very dry and tasted like it may have been frozen at some point. The steak was flavorful, but very tough and chewy. I have to say I did enjoy the mixed flavors of everything but the texture and lack of quality meat was very disappointing. One thing I will say is that they had some very good cocktails. The drinks were the best part about the meal.  I know this next part isn't very helpful for anyone who isn't a concierge, but typically when a concierge is visiting a restaurant for the first time, it is customary for the restaurant to offer a discount or sometimes comp the entire meal. Neither of these options were offered even after I presented my business card. I understand that restaurants cannot always accommodate this but SOME kind of effort to make a good impression may have persuaded me to send them some business. Unfortunately this was not the case and I will never send a guest to this restaurant, because I fear that they may have a similar experience to mine, and I would look like I don't know what I'm talking about.  Sorry, Vermillion. I had high hopes and was rooting for you, but in the end I was severely let down.",

However, the sad part about this evening is that it ended with an issue with the valet parking.  This valet was recommended by the restaurant at $12.00.  When we arrived, we were informed that it was $14.00 with a curfew of 3 hours.  Annoying, but okay.  We were 2 minutes over our valet time restrictions and were told it would be $20.00.  Very annoying, especially since we spent over 2 minutes waiting for our car.  We had just spent close to $1,000.00 to eat at Vermilion and now we were being gouged for having used the valet they recommended.  We could afford to pay the valet, but we had a principle to stand up for (not everyone is a sucker).  Telling our waitress about this swindle got us an apology - let\u2019s hope it gets attention on a higher level than \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d so that other patrons aren\u2019t duped into overpaying an absurd valet service.  We told the waitress we would never be back and we won\u2019t.  The valet experience negated the whole good food experience.  Too bad for them, since we could have brought them several more visits of ten or more people in the future.",
