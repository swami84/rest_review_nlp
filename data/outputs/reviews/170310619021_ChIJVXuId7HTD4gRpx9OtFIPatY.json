The Purple Haze was SO good, it's definitely a must try. The bagel sandwich was delicious, the chive cream cheese was amazing. The berry crepes were also great, the granola on top of the crepes is such a fun addition. I will definitely come here again!",

The chicken and waffle is good as well and so is their burger. Definitely a cute spot and love the flowers in the ceiling.  Drinks are also very tasty and I love their purple haze ( Coffee with ube).

My favorites so far are the breakfast tacos (tasty tortillas!), burrito & ube pancake. I love how their eggs are seasoned and the delicious thick-cut bacon. The purple haze latte is also really well done.  It\u2019s easy to see that the owners, Sarah & Gabe, truly care about their customers and go the extra mile to make all experiences a welcomed one. Jason & Mandyn are always so friendly and make some delicious drinks too! I\u2019ve really enjoyed some of the unique offerings like getting to test out new menu items in their Egghead Club, coffee subscriptions, & the bonus face masks in to-go orders. Thanks Wake \u2018n Bake!",

That tots on the side are very good as well (salty in a good way) . The bagel was very good too and chive cream cheese tasted homemade:) overall great price and great food/portion will be back!
