This location advertises menu items they never have (sweet chili shrimp or ANY shrimp for that matter) yet they refuse to take it off the menu. Even when calling in orders, they take exceptionally long. The food isn't bad, but it isn't great either, middle of the road.... we've always had great options in this neighborhood. I've never heard of Peppas until recently, however they operate this location dragging their feet as far as order speed, and are considerably rude as well. We are VERY familiar with West Indian kitchen culture and we're not asking for much. This location is not cutting it, and I'll only come here in a pinch. Fisherman's Cove and McBeans are still my go to. Peppas needs to work on its hiring practices and put better people in it's Nostrand location. I'm 41 years old, lived in this neighborhood my entire life and my mother worked in food service and hotel hospitality for 40 years.... I know how this is supposed to be done, and this location needs work! Heed the warnings before your brand reputation is damaged.",

They need a tutorial or refresher on quality customer service. They are often preoccupied when you get to the window. I found myself repeating my order several times as well as not getting what I asked for. Over charging for less the size serving and its obvious because the container is clearly not even halfway full. Come on guys please get it together. Other then that the food is still Amazing. I would just hate to go ALL THE WAY to Flatbush to get a Peppas Saucy and Savory serve of anything on the menu.",
