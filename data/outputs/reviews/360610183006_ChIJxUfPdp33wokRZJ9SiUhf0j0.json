Favorite item is the Bao buns, if they have mushroom thats the best variety. You might end up staying and spending anywhere between $15 to $100+ especially if you get drinks (though they usually have free Sake). Great for groups where you can share plates and try several things. Staff is attentive and friendly, definitely make the place what it is. Table and wall art is cool too, especially if you like sailor moon. If you\u2019re visiting or have lived here a while, can\u2019t recommend anywhere in UWS more than Moonrise Izakaya.",

Something for everyone here; with the sacrifice of service and them being out of many things. It\u2019s understandable since the weather warmed up a bit, and dining is coming in a little more full swing since the pandemic. Hopefully they will improve on these fronts.  Food: 5/10 Food was mostly \u201calright\u201d across the board. (Favorite to least favorite) Sticky rice, corned beef bao bun, shrimp dumplings, potato croquettes, mini ramen. Sticky rice was tasty but over cooked. The tempura fried rice was almost rock solid to where it wouldn\u2019t be chewable, however the spicy tuna moistened it up. Mini ramen was bland, and tasted like the burnt ends of the pork from the dirty grill. Croquettes were the only thing that came out hot, and even then they were only good because they had both eel sauce and spicy mayo drizzled (instant red flag at \u2018japanese\u2019 restaurants).  Menu: 5/5 Expansive, a great mix of everything. Mostly small plates with some large plate options. Variety of proteins and plenty of interesting dishes to try out and share. The drink menu is ridiculous. They kill it on that point alone.  Value: 3/5 Food is fairly priced, smaller portions but slightly better than what you typically get at boutique type restaurants. Drinks are pretty PAR with the rest of Manhattan, although they do have a happy hour which knocks this to above average.  Experience: 3/5 Bailey was a phenomenal server; despite the service being spotty at first. This was due to the restaurant getting slammed at once. I think the venue will be able to iron out their service a bit as the weather warms up. Plenty of outdoor seating, heating options in the street seating. Some tables lacking menu QR code is annoying.  There is a bike lane going through the outdoor sidewalk seating and street seating, all i could think about is how many people have been taken out.",

Unfortunately when I went, they did not have heating, so it was a bit chilly while we waited for our food.  Booked this place through Resy, the check in was fairly simple and we were seated right away. We ordered a series of different dishes, both from the brunch and dinner menu and were given a free complimentary sake shot. We ordered the soft shell crab sandwich, pork belly Bao buns, matcha waffles with chicken kaarage (The Panda Combo), cheesy corn, sweet potato avocado toast, and the matcha swirl cheesecake. Due to the amount of people eating there, our food did take a while (about 40 minutes I would say) to come out. I was a bit disappointed when my Panda combo came out as my chicken kaarage was forgotten. Everyone else who had their food, enjoyed their meal.  By the time my kaarage came out, I had already finished my matcha waffles as I was starving and did not want cold waffles. Individually, the matcha waffles were amazing, and you can taste the earthy matcha flavor (I have not been able to achieve that when I make my own matcha waffles), and the kaarage was tasty though a little too salty. I can only imagine the combination together, I think the waffle and syrup would have cancelled out the saltiness of the kaarage.  Aside for the matcha waffles, another highlight was the matcha swirl cheesecake. Not only was it beautiful that we almost did not want to eat it, it was light and creamy as well.  Price wise, I would say it is average ($7-$20), as it is located in Manhattan. Service wise, the waiters were really chill and down to earth. Unfortunately we were seated around the corner, so it was hard to get their attention without having to get up.",

The warm Sweater Weather cocktail definitely helped in the freezing cold. The Bao Buns are average, the dumplings are fresh and tasty.

They have an enclosed heated patio which was only restricted to party of two which I think was unfair coz it was almost empty the whole time we were there.

The cheesy corn is a crowd pleaser. Every time I go I always order the fried chicken and the sausage and the agedashi tofu is super addictive. I love the seafood pancake too. Even the sashimi platter has generous slices of fish and tastes fresh. I keep rotating through the other items like pork and fried chicken bao buns and I heard from someone else that the cheeseburger is delicious so I definitely want to get that next time I go. Right now they have matcha cheesecake but I heard soon there\u2019s going to be tempura ice cream and mochi ice cream I can\u2019t wait.",
