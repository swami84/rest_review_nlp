Me as well as my good friend purchased the sandwiches as well as we were not let down. My one idea is to maintain the cold exterior. Till next time!",

        "caption": "Ate here this evening and received HORRIBLE service. THE WORST EVER. We came in at 9:30 pm, 30 minutes before they closed and all the lights were turned off and the waitress only offered us drinks. It was clear that she didn't want to serve us real food since she was almost done with her shift. After respectfully asking if the kitchen was still open (it obviously was open until 10) she reluctantly handed us menus and barely spoke a word to us or asked for our orders. We literally had to order from across the restaurant because she wouldn't leave the bar area to come and take our order. When our food came out, she didn't ask if we needed anything or how our food was tasting, she just sat behind the counter. As we ate our average tasting food, she turned off more lights and locked the door to the restaurant, even though it was only 9:52 pm. She asked if we would be charging our food to our room (from behind the counter of course) and we said yes. Since she hadn't said a word to us, we assumed she had taken care of our bill so we got up to leave. As we were leaving, she looked at us and said across the restaurant \"EXCUSE ME!?\" Puzzled, we walked back over to the bar to see what she wanted, as she handed us our bill. We paid (and left no tip of course) and we were out the door at 9:58 pm. A)Don't lie. If you are open until 10 pm, don't act like your kitchen closes at 9:30. People aren't stupid. B) Learn common sense. Even if you don't want to serve the customer, you'd do well to be kind and serve them warmly so you can make an extra $5 because you're going to be sitting around for another 30 minutes anyways. C) Learn manners. Be polite and walk over to your customer to let them order and to present them their check. If you hate your job, quit. Don't take it out on the innocent customer.",
