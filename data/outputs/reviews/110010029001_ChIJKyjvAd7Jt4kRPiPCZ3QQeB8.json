The rockfish dinner was delicious, but the quantity of food was the definition of slim and for the price of the plate and I think that's unfortunate. They need to add something more filling to the plate and not raise the price. I was hungry immediately after I left. I ordered wings (yeah) at Wonderland. The desserts looked good beware those were pricey too, we passed though, we were in a rush (wonderland can get packed and we wanted to avoid the wait). And the steak (again delicious) was $29 with no sides, so he also left hungry. I see this location as a for special occasions only. To be fair I should add the pasta dishes maybe more filling than the meat plate (including fish) options. One of the people at the table said the chicken dish was filling.",

GF got the namesake dish, while I ordered the lobster risotto.  The wine list is pretty small, but we found something nice.  Both dishes were delicious.  GF's veal was super tender, and my risotto was loaded with lobster meat.  I crushed it!  I will definitely go back.",
