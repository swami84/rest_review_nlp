As it will always help the restaurant, we should order from the business using their own website.  The delivery experience was not as expected this time but I think they can improve in the future. I placed an order at 1:06pm and called at 1:57 to check, and they still don\u2019t have a delivery person available. Our food was ready when I called. Unfortunately the food arrived cold. The restaurant called after to check in and explained that was a staff mistake and offered refund. I appreciate their customer service. I wanted my husband to try this place but he had to leave for the airport. He ended up ordering from a taco place that comes quicker.  Since the weather is getting warmer now, I would go and get fresh food from Bricolage. If you have to order, still should use their website to help them avoid fees charged by the other platform.",

I\u2019m not even comparing it with what I\u2019ve had in Vietnam but to just a simple basic bowl of pho you can find in nyc. I ordered the pho bo, I appreciated the thickness and tenderness of the beef brisket and tripes were crunchy but they had no taste at all! The broth tasted like nothing to me. It was so bland! I wanted to ask for salt which I never thought I would have to for a bowl of pho. I couldn\u2019t finish the noodle because it was so bad so I asked for it to go (to not waste food and since I had to pay $18 for it).

We felt ok, despite this area being totally enclosed to keep heat in. I was surprised that they called it outdoors given the way it was enclosed in all areas. Shortly after, many other groups came in. They packed us in, my boyfriend was back to back with another table 2 feet away. We wore out masks for a few pets of the night until finally packing our food to go.  People\u2019s safely should be everyone\u2019s first priority. This place did not care about that. And if there is some sort of ventilation system that no one can see allowing that to be called safe, I\u2019d love to understand how.

The banh xeo exterior was crispy with a light brown crust, and it did not get soggy from the shrimp and bean sprouts interior. They did not skimp on the ingredients for this one.  Lastly, the house pickles were a good treat to have with these two dishes. I did not have the five spice fries, but could smell it from the table across from me and wished I had the stomach space for it!  In addition to the food, Bricolage has a charming backyard seating with vintage pieces for it's decor. The open kitchen lets you watch how these delicious bites are put together.

At a time when so much about the world sucks, to be able to go to such a beautiful space, feel safe, eat delicious food  and HAVE FUN is something I don't take for granted. But Bricolage provides all of that. So as my wife was celebrating a big milestone, I started considering the possibility of throwing her a small party in their backyard. It felt like a risky proposition and I worried that few of her friends and family would want to come. But somehow, enough people agreed to make it feel worthwhile. And I couldn't have asked for a better partner than Bricolage. Their owners and staff were so kind, so thoughtful and so detail-oriented that the party went off beautifully. Everyone felt safe. Everyone was blown away by how delicious the food was. And for the first time since March, everyone HAD FUN. Thank you Bricolage!",

When we were scorching in the summer heat, we moved to a partially shaded spot.  As the sun encroached on our spot, they manually cranked open their awning to ensure we stayed comfortable and cool(ish).  Oh right, and the food and drink? Delicious!  I had a salad and the boyfriend had the pho.  We ate every last bite.  The tomato juice they use in their bloody mary is freshly made in-house - creating a surprisingly refreshing, light bloody mary that is a little too drinkable.  If you're in the area, I highly recommend that you give this place a try.",

From then on, the waiter didn't come by at all until 7:30PM and that's after we waved him down because he wasn't coming by. While we watched him go to all the other tables that sat after us. Throughout the service, they barely came over. We waited a while for our food and then when it finally came, the waiter didn't come back at all until we waved him down for the check. We didn't get water refills until we asked the bus boy for water. We pulled out a card to pay and then it took the waiter again another 15 minutes until he came back to get it when we waved him down. They charged a mandatory 20% tip on the bill and didn't actually provide any service to earn that, which was probably because they knew they were charging the 20% tip anyways. Also, it was not noted on the menu anywhere that they were going to charge 20% for tips for a larger group. If they didn't provide such horrible service, the 20% on top would have been okay. The receipt had an option to add tip on top of the ridiculous amount they already charged on top of the bill. We sat at 7PM, didn't get to order until 7:30PM, left the restaurant at 9:10PM while taking only 20 minutes to eat. Most of it was waiting.  Some of the food was good, some were mediocre. The beef chips they had were just dehydrated thin slices of beef and there were only a few pieces for $8. We had chicken wings, they were seasoned well. The emerald rolls were good. For main course we had the pork chop and steak and those were good. Other items on the menu was not all that impressive.  Not impressed and will not be going back.",

I got the vegetarian banh xeo which was a crepe with eggs and beansprouts and mushrooms. It was bomb and honestly filling- I'm not sure if I was supposed to eat it with my hands, but I did and the sauce was addictive.  We also checked in to get the summer roll. Good work, kitchen team!  The business is built on being sustainable and it shows from the solace of the nature-y backyard to it being a renewably powered restaurant. The owners care about building a bit of the natureness of Vietnam in Park Slope and I'm here for it",

I think they nailed it.  Upscale Vietnamese, but also \"Vietnam-izing\" some things you wouldn't normally see in a Vietnamese restaurant.  We had the blackened Shisito peppers, the vegetarian summer roll, the deviled eggs, the pork rib appetizer, and shared the pork chop main, and finished with pudding that had rice, mango, tapioca and some other delicious things in it.  A bottle of tempranillo accompanied.   Thanks for a lovely evening with delicious food.  The highlights would probably be the pork dishes (amazing, cooked perfectly, tender and flavorful and surprising), the peppers (hotter than we bargained for, but awesome), dessert, and... hell, everything was great.",

At 8:45 we left considering no one had even checked in with a status. This is NYC, I realize reservations run late, but they were rude and obviously could care less if we stayed and waited for another 30 minutes or left. Won't be back and won't recommend to others.",

House Made Banh Canh Noodle -coconut milk, tofu, pickled vegetables, bean sprouts\ud83d\ude0d \u2022 THE CHEF \u2022 \u201cOpening a restaurant is not just about being able to cook. We both worked for many years with Charles Phan in San Francisco, managing his restaurants. Ultimately, the difference between managing and owning a restaurant is profound; now we have skin in the game. . So, why New York? Hah, everyone wants to be in New York, it\u2019s exciting! You know the song \u2018If you make it in New York, you can make it everywhere'! Our mentor, Charles Phan, followed the concept of letting ingredients shine and we admire him for elevating the Vietnamese cuisine, and for introducing it to the mainstream in California.  We\u2019ve realized that there aren\u2019t a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in New York, and the ones that you see are more the typical Banh-Mi shops or the old-school Vietnamese restaurants. . We aim to change the perception of Vietnamese food and to introduce a fresh, modern Vietnamese concept. Due to the Vietnam War there is no long-term exposure to the Vietnamese cuisine or culture in America. Refugees brought over Vietnamese dishes, but they were trying to survive here, so it wasn\u2019t the same caliber of cuisine as one would see in Vietnam. . We've been fortunate to find a great group of chef friends with whom we try to push the envelope and modernize Asain cuisines by taking good ingredients and investing the necessary time to create something worthwhile. Our collective friendship over time blossomed into @AsianFoodMafia where we and other chefs meet monthly to cultivate culinary ideas, support one another, and quite frankly, just have fun! We aspire to further elevate Asian cuisine as there's much to be appreciated in its diversity, nuance and flavor. For us, we can already see changes in how Vietnamese cuisine is being perceived and it's truly fantastic!\" ~  Lien & Edward Lin (Chefs/Owner of @BricolageBk) \u2022",

It takes a lot for a restaurant to make it in NY for any amount of time. I feel this will and can keep it going if they keep up what they are doing. They have happy devoted employees that are willing to go above and beyond and be genuinely smiling and happy about it.  Of course food and drinks are always the star of the show, but in an area where it takes \u201cextra special\u201d to make it, they have what it takes. Of course their food is excellent. Exciting and adventurous. Their drinks follow the same characteristics. Tyler the bartender, pours his life experiences into his drinks, bringing in cocktails from around the world. He also has more of what it takes to be \u201cspecial\u201d. He actually spends a little time with all his customers, generally moving onto a second drink concoction that is not on the menu but fits your desires. Of course art takes time. If you are in a rush, this may not be the dinner experience you want. But I\u2019m sure if you told them in advance you had time restrictions, they would probably do their best. They are those kind of people. I live in NJ and come to NY maybe once a year at the most. I would definitely come all the way here just for this.",

There was a trendy crowd on my visit and i'd say it's a place for couples or small groups, as you can order a range of plates and eat them tapas style.

The menu is very exciting for brunch since it's a Vietnamese restaurant so there were lots of choices beyond the usual benedicts and pancakes you can get everywhere. There were also some fun fusion ideas like the chicken and waffles which didn't try this time.  The portions are generous. The service was a little inconsistent, but everyone was very personable.  We enjoyed the papaya salad and Imperial spring rolls to start. We LOVED the Banh Xeo turmeric rice cr\u00eape with mushrooms. We added bacon to it and I used the nouc cham sauce that came with the soup on it since that's how my Vietnamese friends serve this dish.  Unfortunately, the duck soup was a little disappointing. It was fairly bland and the noodles were a little overcooked. It would have looked better and tasted better with some bean sprouts and some Thai basil, more like pho.  We'll definitely be back!",

Everyone was pretty let down by the entree food, especially after waiting over an hour for it. Inexcusable when you have 4-5 staff in the kitchen and a pretty empty restaurant at the time. My meal of fish on noodles was luke warm and the shrimp dish was literally a few shrimp in a sauce with no side of rice or anything else. We got fed up waiting for the check so walked in and paid it. For this price it was a major letdown. Go to Ki Sushi instead. That place was incredible.",
