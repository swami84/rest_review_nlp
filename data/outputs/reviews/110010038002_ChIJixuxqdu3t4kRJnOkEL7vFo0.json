The mics didn\u2019t work properly, the room was extremely small, and it took more time to learn how to work the machine than we actually had to sing songs. I was extremely disappointed as this was an anniversary activity. If I could give no stars, I would. It is NOT worth the time, money, or energy going to this awful place. SERIOUSLY!!! This place has 3 stars for a reason. Frankly, I am surprised the rating isn\u2019t lower than that.",

Still charged room card for other orders, as well as had card and receipt of group member at bar , confused at the over charging, lack of customer service and communication , was not offered anything as well as she swiped my card twice!  when told about the over charge, the card at the bar and orders on room she became flustered and aggressive, shoed off other guest trying to check out, swiped my card for the over charged refunded me and then had to charge my card for original price ! Smh I wouldn\u2019t recommend this spot go to wok and roll across the street ! Cheaper and maybe better service , they just want your money here and will not accommodate or offer anything! Poor customer service , rude service, lack of communication, over charging and language barrier ! Everything is ok until you get there !",

We originally had reservations from 8:30-11pm and had an email confirmation. My sister asked to change to a bigger room and asked if we could still get the reservation until 11pm and the manager agreed. Around 10pm the karaoke stopped working and we were told we had to leave, we were confused because the manager originally said we could stay until 11pm. The manager proceeded to call my sister a liar and said she super late to the reservation anyway. My sister got there at 8:32 and wasn\u2019t checked in until 8:35; the whole experience here was just terrible. The manager could not find a way to accommodate use in the situation she created. We were having so much fun doing karaoke and lost an hour trying to find a solution. When we left no one else was even using the room we were in. This definitely ruined my sister\u2019s birthday. Horrible customer service by the manager who couldn\u2019t even communicate clearly.",

We found their music system to be hard to use and not intuitive -- for example searching for an artist required us to select by ID, type in their name, press cancel, then attach the artist into our queue.  Searching was generally poor as well -- searching for an artist might not bring up the artist, but using their ID would -- it was a mess. Service was on point though, and they were very attentive to their patrons (this is what saved this review from a 2 star).  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) this is the only local karaoke bar in the area so you are kind of stuck with what you got.   I hope they work to upgrade their rooms and pricing structure.",
