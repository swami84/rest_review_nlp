When we receive our food it was cold and the fish & shrimp combos were terrible. Neither the fish or shrimp had absolutely no flavor (seasoning) it had been cooked in what apperead to be old coooking grease. The fish was soggy and you can smell the burnt grease. It was not even remotely edible. I would not even feed it to my dog! I was highly disappointed because when they first opened it was amazing. It was cool to see a black owned  restaurant deliver quality food.  But this go round made me never want to eat from there again",

I asked if that could be done and he told me that i had high expectations. He told me that his server did one thing wrong and wanted to explain why he hires people like her. He wanted to have a conversation about what I felt was wrong, and then told me that in a minute he would \u201ctell me no\u201d regarding wiping down the table.

Don\u2019t understand how you can be out of KETCHUP and TARTAR sauce but think it would be a acceptable thing to send only 1 2oz portion of ketchup an tartar sauce. Then when the customer calls the best answer you can give them is \u201cwe are out so you got what you got\u201d and hang up... Then when I call back multiple times to speak to someone higher up \u201cthe owner\u201d I am told they are not there. WELL OBVIOUSLY THEY AREN\u2019T THERE BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE SPEAKING TO YOU AT THIS POINT! So when I asked for a contact I was again hung up on. She was so incredibly nasty and rude. Last, as we went to taste the food the fish tasted old and the texture was very chewy and slimy. Not anything near a fried fish texture even after being in a container for an hour. Now I\u2019m trying to dispute it through door dash for this $60 meal I received. IF YOU\u2019RE READING THIS DO NOT GO THERE! Save your money and your time!.",

Never again.  Edit:we just called and the young lady told us they are closed!!! It is now 9:33pm and we ordered from 6:00pm. Outrageous! There was no communication whatsoever.

The food is awesome (highly recommend the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and spicy honey wings) and the owners have a generous heart as evidenced by the fact that during Covid they've been giving away free food to the community everyday.  My only complaint is that both times we've gone they've forgotten part of our order. The first time we caught it right away and were able to get our missing wings added, but the second time we didn't realize we were missing our two orders of fries until we got home. Bummer! So my recommendation: go, but make sure you've got everything before you walk away.",

The great thing is they are open to the criticism and have worked out the downs. And I'm sure will continue to do so with all feedback.  My favorites from the menu, so far, are the Troy Ave shrimp and chips (sweet potato fries for me!) and the BBQ wings. The shrimp are so FLAVORFUL and have a nice crisp to them without being too crunchy or hard. And those fries are tasty with a lil Bergen sauce.  I had heard talks about the chicken sandwich being taken off the menu, but I'm excited to see it's still there because I'm coming for it!  The Bergen has been doing it up for the community during this pandemic. I appreciate the love and the dedication from the owner and staff.",
