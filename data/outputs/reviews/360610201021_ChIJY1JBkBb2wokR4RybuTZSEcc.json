Best thing to do for bang for your buck is to go for combos as buying the food individually is  for the flavor. too much butter sometimes whole block drenched in sauce. The sides aren't spectacular either. Less than average but better than subpar. The dirty rice isnt dirty, its just bland. You can make any side better at home. Consider the time of day when going as you may catch them when they're at their worst. This was done in the night after 8p.  Plus side, the wait staff that worked were VERY friendly and accommodating considering the circumstances. Best part of the restaurant. Just wish the food quality matched \ud83d\ude13",

Despite all of this, I have to point out that the backyard enclosure is still too cold, the servers brought out our sides before the seafood boils were done which led to our sides being cold as soon as our boils were served...not cool. The corn and wok charred cauliflower was undercooked and hard but my partner's broccoli was well cooked, yet flat in flavor. The ginger butter boil was flat. The rice and beans was also flat.

We had family in town and wanted to escape the heat of the Valley and Moonshadows seemed a great respite.  All four of us were pleasantly surprised how wonderful the food and the service was excellent.  I'm still reeling about the chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread with pesto sauce and whatever else yummy ingredients made their way to this excellent, decadent, amazing sandwich.  I have been begging my husband to take me to Moonshadows just to have the chicken sandwich.  The rest of us had a burger which was devoured by my 84 year old Father-in-law, both girls had the coveted beet salad with grilled chicken which they loved.",

Twice it was overcooked and dry plus they forgot an item. Although, they were tasty, the plaintain chips and salsa is overpriced for the quantity that you get.",

We spent over 80 dollars and the sliver ware was plastic and the plates were throw away tin pans. The staff were friendly trying to over compensate for the environment which is extremely low level for the price being paid. Another downer is you have to pay before ordering; this is disappointing because if you actually saw the eating area you would move on to a more desirable eating destination. Bottom line, this establishment needs to modulate their pricing and upgrade their environment before I would spend another dollar!",

I had 2 dishes to share with a friend and that was the way to go. One was this battered shrimp over French fries which had so much flavor. The other was there shrimp boil which we were given gloves to eat with. It's a messy dish so you totally needed it. I have to say that was tremendously good and one of the tastiest dishes I had in a while. It was in this coconut curry sauce with HUGE pieces of shrimp, potatoes and corn. They're was a lot of shrimp... A Lot of shrimp. They were way bigger and way more than I thought we would get. My only complaint was that the sauce is so good in that dish I wanted something to soak it up with. So I started to soak the fries in there. Mmmm... So good. Oh and there's a back yard so I can't wait to go back in the summer.",

Lolo's Seafood Shack was right around the corner from where I was, so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the coconut shrimp and fries basket ($10). The coconut shrimp came with about 6 pieces. They were nice and crispy and had the perfect amount of coconut flavor. Fries were delicious. The basket also came with a yellow aioli that was a little sweet but went well with the coconut shrimp and fries. The food took a little longer than expected to come out, but it wasn't a terrible wait or anything.",

You can get some sun in the backyard or keep cool in one of their three dining areas. Even though the space is not big they made the most out of the room that they do have. There is one communal style dining room which is great for up to eight people to have a private event which was unexpected. Regardless if you get a table or not there are a bunch of counter space and cozy spots that you can choose from. You pay at the counter and get a number and sit anywhere you like, they literally come find you LOL the food comes out as it\u2019s ready which I love so everything is always hot and fresh!!! It does get busy so try to go during their off peak hours which are listed on google I think. I usually go with about 2-4 people and we always have a feast: Pom Pom shrimp, Johnny cakes and honey butter, snow crab legs with coconut curry sauce, wok fried cauliflower \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f and of course the crab cake sandwich ( any sand which really the bread is soooooo good).
