My friends and I manage to find enough cash on us to pay for the bill and an okay tip, but when we hand it to the waitress she counted it all out in front of us and said we weren\u2019t giving her a big enough tip. Then she says she can take card after all. We\u2019re extremely suspicious at this point, and just trying to leave because we\u2019re extremely uncomfortable. We sign the bill and go to leave, and the waitress literally chases us out the door and asks why we didn\u2019t tip more. After leaving we saw a bunch of other reviews online of people saying this exact situation happened to them even when they tip more than 25%. Overall extremely odd and weird and uncomfortable. Never experienced anything like this in a restaurant before.",

Great appetizer with tons of soup in every bun. Just becareful not to burn your tongue as the soup can run really hot. The Shanghai noodles were great, but wish we had a little more. I have to take one star away because the \"chef specialty 5 flavor duck\" was extremely bland. The presentation of the dish looked very promising, but as soon as i bit into the dish my face was full of regret. The skin was soft like boiled chicken and the sauce tasted like watered down curry. The more appropriate name for this dish is watered down curry duck, not five flavor duck. I much prefer the duck from ANY other Chinese restaurant. We couldn't even finish the dish. Overall, the bao and the noodles were a hit. Service was pleasant.",

The dumpling is at least on par if not better than Joe\u2019s (I\u2019ve been to Joe\u2019s before, the owner came out and explained the way it was made and cooked, hand-wrapped skin so it\u2019s thin and tender, steamed to the right minute, he said ours was actually steamed one minute longer, but nonetheless, delicious! Other dishes were very authentic tasting Shanghainese dish as well, a little bit on the savory side. Highly recommended if you don\u2019t want to wait in line at Joe\u2019s for an hour and go after the hype but want to have the same tasting experience of crab soup dumpling.",

Great appetizer with tons of soup in every bun. Just becareful not to burn your tongue as the soup can run really hot. The Shanghai noodles were great, but wish we had a little more. I have to take one star away because the \"chef specialty 5 flavor duck\" was extremely bland. The presentation of the dish looked very promising, but as soon as i bit into the dish my face was full of regret. The skin was soft like boiled chicken and the sauce tasted like watered down curry. The more appropriate name for this dish is watered down curry duck, not five flavor duck. I much prefer the duck from ANY other Chinese restaurant. We couldn't even finish the dish. Overall, the bao and the noodles were a hit. Service was pleasant.",

The quality of the food was great (particularely XLB, think they are the best in Mannhattan Chinatown in point of the taste of the broth and filling, juciness and quality of the wraper). Though some of them were touching each other none got torn when was handled which is a rare case with XLB. Can't recommend this place high enough for XLB lovers. The only thing that they have to change is their hours on Google and other webs. I called and they said they open at 10:30a (not 11a) every day.",

The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly while remaining extremely efficient. Food is served promptly and it is very fresh. Fortunately we were splitting everything we ordered or it might have been awkward when the entrees arrived separately, especially since the appetizer had yet to arrive. Despite that, this place remains 5 stars in my book. Best of all, the lunch prices are cheaper than back home in the Midwest. The food was so flavorful that I will probably be dreaming of it for years. We had the twice cooked pork and curry chicken lunch entrees that came with rice and a delightful soup. I have to start by saying that I usually dislike Chinese curries, but this one came recommended by our server and it was AMAZING. The twice cooked pork was even better though. There was no description on the menu, but it is basically pork, bok choy, tofu and carrots in a bright red chili sauce that was not hot at all with robust flavors that blended so well, I could not easily identify them. We also had the duck and crab dumplings. These were filled with meat that was finely ground and formed into perfect balls of pure delight. Along with the meat was a broth that was perfectly clear and had rich meaty flavors that perfectly complemented the dumpling dough. As great as the rest of the meal was, I would have been completely content to eat nothing but these dumpling for the entire meal. Finally we finished the meal with a red bean pancake. This fried delicacy is mildly sweet with the big flavors you get from deep frying dough.",

It's a normal tea served in Chinese restaurant. I didn't order it. It's a common complimentary). I was okay to pay for tea and consider that it is a tip that they should get. (tea charge was already more than 30% of my food though) I might misunderstanding them but they started complaining in both Eng and Chinese that I should give them extra tips too! I mean normally, no matter how much I order I always give tips but free tea. They charge me 30% of my food for the tea and still asked me for the tips? and complaining? I don't think it's fair.

The feeling of giving people is particularly affordable. The two of us had to eat a table of dishes, and the fullness of the food was packed and brought back a lot. It took only 30 knives.  The taste of the dishes is also great! I think that at least on the small island of Manhattan, his family is one of the few authentic Chinese restaurants. It is especially recommended that his family's hot and sour soup ~ really super delicious ~ is better than the Sichuan restaurant!  I think his boss is not easy.
