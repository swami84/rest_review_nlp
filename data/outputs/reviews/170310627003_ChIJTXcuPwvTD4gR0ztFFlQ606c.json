        "caption": "The chicken and waffles were great. The chicken itself was perfectly flavorful, crisp, and cooked to perfection. The honey mustard that came with it was whatever and the syrup was also pretty good. Didn't have the same consistency as most real Maple syrups but it was still enjoyable.  The \"chorizo\" hash really didn't have enough chorizo. That's I think the biggest complaint for my experience. It came out and I actually thought they brought me the wrong order. It wasn't until I flipped the eggs over and discovered roughly a quarter cup of overcooked chorizo. It really should have been corn, potatoes, and eggs with a side of guacamole and chorizo. If you ask me I'd get rid of the sauce and maybe even the corn and double up on chorizo. Heck, I think there might have been more guacamole than chorizo.  I was also surprised they served Intelligentsia Coffee. Kudos!  The staff were very nice and accommodating. I think that definitely helps the experience!  3/5 for good 5/5 for service/staff 4/5 overall",
