The orange chicken didn't have enough sauce and had a strange taste and the pad see ew also had an odd taste. The price was around $11 and the portion size was tiny. I threw most of it away.

Meaning I got a scoop of brown rice in the main styrofoam lunch container with a small scoop of fried chicken in a corner of the container. They charged a flat $10. I would have gotten the steamed veggies as well for another dollar but they were straight from a frozen bag where the carrots are crinkle-cut. This place never has a full line in the food court at Merch Mart like Mezza does right next to Silom. Having a basic cooking background, I can tell when a food court just transfers food from being frozen to something heated up and charges a premium for it.",

Their model is typical food court where you simply pick 1, 2, or 3 entres and they assemble it for you in 60 seconds. They have many traditional Thai dishes like massaman, panang, basil, and pad Thai. They also have a couple typical Asian-inspired dishes like orange chicken and egg rolls. My advice is to stick with the Thai food as it has been consistent good for me.",
