I enjoyed the french toast (prepared casserole style with a tasty tart compote) and the hefty breakfast sausages. It was rich and far more filling than the simple size of it would suggest. My dining partner had the Belgian waffle which was light and fluffy and topped with fresh fruit, not syrupy glaze. Service was attentive and cordial, suggesting upscale dining even in hoodies and sneakers. Will dine again!",

        "caption": "I came here for a V day dinner expecting a nice meal with good cocktails. My first complaint was that they had a \u201cspecial\u201d menu which did not match the one posted online when I booked the table, which showed vegetarian options. The special menu had no vegetarian options at all, only salad. The server, a nice-enough young man, told us they could prepare a vegetable and pasta dish, so I went along, not having any other options, very hungry and already feeling the cocktail. The pasta dish and my partners dish came out suspiciously early. My pasta was intolerably disappointing, a weirdly almost curry-spiced soupy pile of angel hair pasta with some sad, soggy cooked tomatoes (and no other vegetables). It truly tasted and looked horrible. For context, I\u2019m a very good cook and I could tell zero effort was expended on this meal and am confident I can cook 10x better. However, my partner appeared to relish his roasted chicken dish.  I complained to my server who took back the plate with no questions asked and took my order for a salad in its place. The salad was okay but contained huge unchopped halves of baby lettuce and was deeply unsatisfying for my hunger. The portion size was insultingly small and for the taste and effort expended, it was overpriced.  The cocktails were good. My server was nice. The rest of the staff had a weird, cold vibe. Including the hostess who repeatedly asked us if we had a reservation, yes we did, we had even called to confirm. We were told the patio lounge was \u201clit\u201d by the whitest guy imaginable. We went upstairs to find the expected set of middle management type Gen Xers and R\u2019n\u2019B from the 2000\u2019s. The patio was too cold to really sit out on. It was really pathetically lame. Obviously being a weird group of socially isolated straight white people, nobody was talking to each other, just the person they came with. Thank u, next.  I will never revisit this lame and disappointing establishment. I can\u2019t believe they bombastically bill themselves as a \u201cworld class\u201d restaurant. A world class restaurant would be able to whip up an acceptable pasta dish. Hell, give me some tomatoes, garlic, basil and tomato paste and I can whip up a GREAT pasta dish! They could have even offered me a quinoa side dish I saw with one of the other meals. The total lack of respect was shown in the poor care given and poor food that was served. If you are looking for an extravagant, nice night out (which is so rarely something I indulge in), this is not it. It\u2019s as if everything is a mirage, the interiors are nice but littered with dead bugs, an appropriate symbol for the entire experience. Maybe they didn\u2019t respect me because I\u2019m relatively young (27) for their demo and Indian-American, but that is just another reason to avoid this place like plague if you are anyone like me. I have been to truly world class restaurants in Montreal, where I am treated warmly and respectfully, and there is no problem making dietary accommodations. This is really just a cheap place that\u2019s overpriced.",

(we had Root Beer) She also didn\u2019t seem to want to do her job. She wasn\u2019t rude just gave the impression she didn\u2019t like her job. The food was pretty good. I had the half roasted chicken and my wife had a filet. The food wasn\u2019t worth the price. The Overall experience was okay. I probably won\u2019t go back. Happy I gave it a try though.

I felt horrible for a large party that had children with them who were having the same issues we were. After airing their displeasure, the manager came out and actually began arguing with them, in earshot of all, about their complaints.

My visit was on 12-18-18: Ok so here's the thing. Company department went for a work dinner. When I found out where we were going, I was a little unsure about it as I had read some bad reviews of the restaurant online. Firstly, this place is expensive. I was surprised that the entrees do not come with sides which are equally expensive. $8 for a bread basket? $13 for a Caesar salad? Ridiculous. Especially considering that entrees are $29+. Now we were a fairly large group of 11, but it was completely dead and service was slow. It was about 5 minutes wait for drink refills after being asked if we wanted one (mostly draft beers and in my case an iced tea). It took about an hour from everyone being seated and ordering until we started being served. As I stated, I ordered iced tea because I don't drink alcohol) I would think that a place as \"upscale\" and expensive as this would have fresh brewed tea, but it was Lipton Brisk which I don't consider to be tea - it's sugar water with some food coloring (and that's a generous description). Now I'll admit, that's on me for not asking before ordering. Now, for the food review. I ordered the filet mignon (8 oz for $49!) cooked medium because I don't like a lot of pink in my steaks. Because it took so long, the steak didn't come out piping hot as you would expect (I do understand that meat should rest for a bit before being served) but rather what I would describe as a little warmer than warm. It also had A LOT of pink so I think it was done medium rare or rare instead of medium. I bit the bullet because it was a work function and I didn't want to be that guy to make a scene. That being said, I thought the steak was absolutely delicious. It was probably the best steak I've had in my entire life; it was full of flavor and just melted in my mouth like butter. I would have loved to give this a 5 star review but with the amount of time it took to get served when there was almost no one else at the restaurant (maybe two or three different couples but certainly not any other large parties) and the time waiting for refills, and the food not being as hot as I felt it should or could have been, I can't give it more than 4 stars. The staff was great, very friendly, and our main server looked a bit like a redheaded Benedict Cumberbatch. I may consider returning for a special occasion but definitely not casually.",

We were celebrating my in-laws 60th wedding anniversary and thought it would be an extra special and beautiful venue.  Dry dry dry dry food all around the table of 10. Food was cold or just warm,  eggs  benedict was no better than some I could get at a family restaurant, Monte Cristo sandwiches looked unappetising and hash and potatoes were super dry.  The eggs benedict took up less than a quarter of the plate...maybe a tablespoon of hollandaise sauce on each egg.  Presentation on every plate was nothing special...a sprinkle of parsley. When I made the reservation I told them it would be a 60th anniversary celebration and the hostess said she would write that on the reservation, all they came up with was a quick happy anniversary after we asked the waitress to take a group picture before we left. Maybe I was expecting too much..I thought they might surprise them with a special drink or something.  I wouldn't go back. They need to step it up if they expect people to come from the towns outside of Buffalo. Left us so disappointed.",

Pork belly was ok but quite fatty - which is to be expected. Scallops were delicious - which gives me hope that perhaps there were other items on the menu that were just as good. Service was super slow - the server (Emily) took a very long time to greet me and take my order, and even longer to take my bill at the end.

I walked in with only seeing the bartender asking where to sit. He said bar or seating, I choose seating always. I waited and was greated awkwardly however she seated me then briefly after the waiter arrived. I asked what type of cider do you carry; she quickly said Stella. She arrived 15 min later with a different cider and stared to pour it. I mentioned that is not a Stella miss.  Their was no one sitting or enjoying beverages at the bar so I'm not sure why it took so long in the first place. This was only said to myself at this point. I was asked if I would like anything else, I replied with anything sweet. This one took another 10 min to arrive with finally a water that should be serverd when you sit down. The $17 porkbelly blt was half fat, which you would think a $17 small sandwhich would be well sorted without a 1/4\" slab if fat in the while sanwhich. The margarita pizza was the best part and it bursting with flavors. Very disarisfied with the service and quality of a high class restaurant $17 sand which and lack of serving water and beverage before I get my meal. Yes that's right I did not get any sort of beverage until after I was served my lunches.",

With one exception we loved the food...I wouldn't recommend the Berkshire Pork Belly small plate as it had only 1 very small piece of pork and I've had similar dishes at similar type restaurants and this was just a total rip off.  If the piece weighed 1/8 ounce I'd be surprised.  C'Est la Vie.  I will return but forgo the small plate stuff.  My wife had the octopus which was fantastic and of normal portion size.  For dinner we enjoyed Strip loin and Salmon w/ mussels.  Both were very enjoyable.
