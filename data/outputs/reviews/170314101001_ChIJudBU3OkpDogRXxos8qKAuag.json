Immediately I felt a sticky-ness from the front of menu as I opened it - also, I was sitting in a booth facing outside towards the window and that window and every other window was streaky and \u2018caked\u2019 up. At this point I became suspect of how just how clean this restauran is. Off putting and gross m.  The menu is odd because it is a fusion between two different types of restaurants. I ordered blackened chicken with mashed potatoes and corn - the chicken was seasoned nicely but it was rather dry - the mash potatoes were not good at all since they were loaded with butter with no seasoning/chives and the corn was overcooked(completely wilted and dry)and poorly seasoned. My guest ordered a fried seafood platter - the crawfish are breaded whole which is odd and they were completely, dried out. I had a fried okra and hush puppy - both were OK. I also had a friend shrimp which was OK.  Service was fine. Bottom line is this restaurant has poor hygiene and sub-par food. Will not return. .",

It was flavored well and had huge jumbo shrimp in it. It was so good, I started telling my sisters about it. I ordered it again a few days later for my sisters. This time I paid to have added brown rice ($4.00 extra). When I picked it up I asked, \"Where's the rice?\" The waitress replied, \"It's in there,\" meaning in the bowl of rice, MIXED IN! I paid an extra $4.00 and you put two tablespoons of rice IN WITH THE GUMBO? Okay, whatever, maybe they misunderstood, but the food still tasted great. Next time I ordered the same gumbo and I noticed the shrimp are now medium sized shrimp and the added rice is still mixed in. When buying a $9.00 bowl of gumbo, I do not expect for the shrimp to get smaller, nor do I want the added rice to be mixed in because it takes away from the amount of gumbo in the already small bowl. I ordered for the LAST TIME today, the same thing Shrimp Gumbo with brown rice. I get there to pick it up and they inform me that they don't have brown rice anymore and here's some white. This time I actually got the white rice in  a separate container, BUT I DON'T EAT WHITE RICE. I taste the gumbo and it's horrible! Completely bland and now the shrimp are the smallest shrimp I've ever seen. Not ever medium sized, more like salad shrimp. I don't know what the rest of the menu is like and I'm sure I'll never go back to try. This is totally ridiculous. Save your money and don't even stop by.",

Everything from the decor to the food is all middle of the road,  and doesn't leave much of an impression.  The clear theme of this restaurant is unclear, as the decor and the menu are directionless.  My date and I had the New York strip, with \"truffle\" mac and cheese,  and shrimp fettuccine.  The steak was cooked properly for the most part but the cut of meat was awful, full of fat and chewy. There was not one once of seasoning not even salt or pepper, the truffle mac incorporated no truffle whatsoever, it was also bland and tasteless. The noodles themselves were under-cooked and semi-stiff, the \"cheese\" was grainy - awful.  My date's shrimp Alfredo was bland! The dishes are garden variety dishes and this restaurant struggles with executing these basic dishes. the fettuccine was under-cooked, thus registering a really tough chew.  All in all it appears as the chef is adverse to seasoning.  All in all i'd say avoid this place as the price to experience ratio is way off, you can do much better by popping over to whole foods and purchasing the ingredients yourself, the execution here was downright pedestrian and first time cooks have a shot at producing better results than this.",
