The manager who is running the place is extremely rude and mean. Typically it is a hassle to even receive the order and I usually end up unassigning. I will only accept orders from this place as a last resort if I need the money and am having a bad night. You, sir, and your mistreatment and rudeness towards customer service workers, have lost a potential customer and any support for this establishment! It doesn\u2019t hurt to show a little bit of kindness. We\u2019re all struggling here, and making people\u2019s jobs and lives harder for them than it already is doesn\u2019t help. Try and grow some empathy and decency towards other people! Shame on you!",

It was also not rolled properly and came with the smallest sliver of fish. It also only had 8 pieces when normally it comes with 10. After explaining to the waiter that it was not the roll I ordered, they refused to remake it and told me I was wrong even though I have ordered it many times and showed a picture of what it normally looks like.

We were very understanding of the given circumstances with the lack of service, but it shouldn\u2019t have been that slow in a restaurant with 6 tables filled. We ordered a sushi and sashimi for two platter and a martini which ended up have a fruit fly. We did get a replacement, but the bartender didn\u2019t seem too happy. Portions are a bit skimpy for the price, but I guess the environment makes up for it. Bathrooms are a bit dark in the ladies room with buckets in the way.  Not for or against another visit.

I've had the garlic eggplant in the past,  which is also excellent.  Fast service, and friendly staff. Pretty decor, and outside seating is also available.

However, after my 2 most recent experiences I will not be giving this business my money any longer. Their lunch comes with a soup and a salad. Recently, they have not been giving me the salad. I always ask for it politely, and the host usually apologizes and gets it, but the last two times I was confronted by the owner and told it was my fault they didn't give me a salad. He was very rude both times and basically gaslit me about my own order. He launched into two different very long convoluted explanations both times. It was so weird and made me really uncomfortable. I just wanted my tiny little salad! I see that other people have had bad service experiences here, and I honestly think it's because the owner is a really strange, mean guy. I think they probably treat their employees terribly. I'll be steering clear even though it's convenient.  P.S. I did recently notice that they use CONSIDERABLY less fish (specifically spicy tuna) in their lunch rolls, as I ordered one at dinner.",

My Pad Thai tasted like a mixture of ketchup and peanuts and my boyfriend's veggie sautee was extremely bland. The wakame and tofu square apps were delicious, though, and the atmosphere was great. Our waiter, Adam, was rather rude. He seemed annoyed any time we asked a question and looked at us like we were dumb for asking if they had spicy mustard or to simply add broccoli to the vegetable sautee. He also gave us our bill without asking first after disappearing for long periods of time. 2 or more of us wanted dessert...and it was a good hour before they even closed. I'm usually pretty understanding having been a server myself, but the mix between our unpleasant waiter and the very mediocre entree dropped my rating down to average. The appetizers and cocktails are what kept it above a 2-star, and honestly, the sushi my friend got looked amazing. In the end, though, for the price you pay, it wasn't worth it to me and I don't plan on returning here.",

I am a big fan of Thai food, and as there aren\u2019t many Thai places in the downtown area I gave this place two tries with two different dishes (the second was Pad Thai because I figured that\u2019s a classic), and I am not sure that I have been more disappointed by Thai food either time. So, I decided I would give their sushi a try. Gainesville has great sushi, and this place is just not up to snuff. The spicy mayo was an odd white color and had a completely liquid consistency. I have never seen sloshy, white spicy mayo elsewhere. I don\u2019t normally write bad reviews, but I gave this place a lot of chances and in the end it was a waste of money. Do not recommend.",

We went on Valentine's day, so I can understand being busy, and there being a wait for sushi orders, and having a new server in training, and the possibility of being short on sushi chefs, and even our party forgetting about it after our bottle of plum wine and a good main course, BUT.... I really wish we would have received our Black Dragon sushi plate that was ordered and paid for. I bet it would've been yummy. Other than that; 4, possibly 5 stars.",

We sat down around 8pm, opened our menus, and this blonde girl brought out water, got uncomfortably close to me with her eyes wide open and asked \"Hi theeeere! How are yooou?\". By the way she looked at me and the way she stretched her words, I was fairly sure she was drunk or high.  Once she handed us drinks, she never came back. She walked past us about 6 times. We did all the regular \"we're ready\" signals (closed our menus, unrolled our napkins, even made eye contact with the server). This blonde girl just kept walking right past us despite looking me in the eye and smiling. By about 8:15, we debated leaving. At this point, another couple came in and sat down; the moment they sat down, she whipped over to them with water and took their orders. That's when we got up and walked out.  On our way out the door, the host WHO JUST SEATED US said \"thanks for coming, have a good night!\". We looked back and told him, \"we didn't get served. You know we just came in, right?\". He looked as us very confused, almost as though he was as high as the blonde server. From 8 to 8:15, they only seated us and that one other couple who came in. Dude...like, you seated two tables, how the hell did you forget us that quickly?  I lived in Gainesville for several years, I've been here several times and never had a bad experience before. I came to visit from Houston and wanted to eat here because I've missed it, but wound up at Boca Fiesta instead. I've tried calling to discuss this matter, but nobody has been available to speak with me.  Very disappointed, guys.",

Good location. Bathroom is having some issues and service is a little slow. But still, it was $9 for two rolls a soup and salad so it really turned out okay.

The atmosphere is quiet, so it is possible to talk with your dinner companions without raising your voice.  So pleasant.  Our server was good except she decided the serving of the fish Ordered was too small and, without asking me, she held up my dinner while another, larger portion was cooked.  As a result everyone at the table was eating well before my dinner finally arrived.  The smaller fish was also included and it would have been just fine.  In fact, I ate the smaller fish and took the larger one home.  My birthday dessert was wonderful...a yummy cheesecake that was plentiful enough for good sharing.  I had a bento box and everything was very good.  Everyone else seemed pleased with their food and we will be back.",

The miso soup is the best I've ever had in my life and I like to frequent Asian restrauants. Their ginger dressing salad was exceptional. I ordered the filet mignon and holy moly I was in love. My boyfriend got two sushi rolls, both he ate each bite with a small orgasmic moan because it was so good. Definitely recommend this place.  I will be back.",

        "caption": "Description: I came here a few weeks ago for lunch. A friend of mine said their food was pretty good and worth trying so I figured why not. From where it's located to its name, Liquid Ginger, sounds like a cool fusion hip restaurant if I had to take a wild guess. Although the interior is nice and somewhat ideal to bring a date, it wasn't what I was expecting. The place looked a tad worn out and generic. My guess is that the restaurant has looked the same for a long time. Again, nothing wrong just not what I expected when I heard the name.  Food & Service: I will say their lunch menu is very affordable and quite reasonable. A lot of their lunch specials came with a soup and salad, not bad. It seems to be a solid place for people getting a bite to eat on their lunch break. Not sure about their dinner. Anyways, my experience turned a bit sour from there. After getting my water, my waiter didn't come back for awhile to take my order. Granted he was busy but it took longer than usual. I ordered the coconut curry with shrimp. Soup and salad were very basic. It's nice that they come with the meal but it's just filler food in my opinion. The curry was eh. Flavor wasn't bad but it was slightly watery and wasn't very hot. Rice portion was a tad stingy. The vegetables and shrimp weren't good though. Not well seasoned and tasted like packaged food. The shrimp was way too rubbery, definitely overcooked. I was in and out pretty quick because I had to work. The waiter was kind enough to bring me a box and my check swiftly so I could leave.  Final Thoughts: Overall, I'll still give the place 3 stars because I didn't have a terrible experience but it definitely won't be memorable. There's a chance I'll come here again for lunch because of the prices though. I'll stick to something else next time. I've heard their dinner is not bad though? I'll do a possible updated review in the future. Oh! I heard they do have some good tea though, also something to check out maybe.",

You can tell they cut corners and sacrifice some of the quality. If you want sushi I would recommend Dragonfly down the street. The red curry was mediocre, no kaffir lime taste or Thai basil to make the dish stand out. Also, we waited 45 minutes for our food when it seemed pretty empty inside.",

It was really mushy and soggy and just overall greasy from the mayonnaise. We ate a few pieces in a hope that the roll would redeem itself but it did not. I told the waitress that I didn't like the roll and asked if it could be taken off the bill. She was very nice and told me they could make a new roll. We were already done with our meal and didn't want to wait for a new roll so I asked if she could ask the manager if the roll could be taken off the bill. She came back with a menu and stated that he said they would gladly make us a new roll but would not remove the roll from the bill. I asked if I could speak with the manager directly. The manager came over and we had a dispute about the quality of the food and removing it from the bill. This dispute lasted for several minutes and in front of numerous other customers. After several minutes I gave up the argument because I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave and he finally decided they would remove the cost of the sushi. Overall it was an awful experience and I would not return. The whole situation was completely unprofessional.",

Last night, we were seated next to a couple who had a problem with one of the items they ordered. We overheard the discussion because after they politely asked to send the barely touched food item back, the manager refused to remove the item from the bill. They asked to speak with the manager directly and he publicly argued with them refusing to take the item off their bill. From what I heard, they had good reason to remove it because they had already finished the rest of their food and the sushi item was of very poor quality. If I were the manager, I would immediately take the small loss to keep the customer happy. It was clear they were dissatisfied with the quality of the food and not trying to cheat the restaurant. It made myself and I imagine the others around very uncomfortable. Very disappointed with this experience and will not be back.",

I thought it was just a discoloration from a lettuce leaf until I saw a leg and then wings and the head. Yep there was a fly that had drowned in the ginger dressing. I was disgusted. Told our waiter and he just looked at the fork., and offered me a new salad. Of course I didn't want one I just wanted to leave but I wanted my sushi. We got our check and nothing was discounted and no apology was offered. I asked him to speak with a manager and he was the manager. He said that it wasn't a fly. Excuse me sir!!!

I've been to Liquid Ginger several times, and the food has been fantastic for each visit: the fish specials and steaks that are on the regular menu are fantastic. Service can be a little slow, even when the restaurant isn't that busy, so I always try to budget an extra hour or so when I go (especially for large parties) but I feel that it's well worth the wait. Great wine selection and drink menu as well. This is definitely a place I bring friends and family from out of town!",
