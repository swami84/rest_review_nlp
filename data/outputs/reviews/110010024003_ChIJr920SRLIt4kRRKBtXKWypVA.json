Well that got my attention. My friend who is a builder said prefabricated food. What a concept!!! Lol  FYI I've eaten here before and didn't particularly like it. Very bland salsa very small portions I've had better food at taco Bell. And I'm sure you can see what my last name is Padilla. So I'm familiar with Latin food. Staff was nice service was good. Pleasant atmosphere and good drinks but would eat elsewhere.",

When it's a Friday evening and I want margaritas and taco, that is definitely something I take into consideration and usually end up at one of the 14th St locations instead.

I\u2019m sad to say it has been slowly declining over time. The service is very hit or miss lately. Some servers are very prompt and responsive. Others (one in particular) walk up to your table without greeting you or asking what you want and just stare at you. The last time I was there, I was seated outside and both tables on either side of me asked for a variety of things (their check, their drink, more chips and salsa) MULTIPLE times. I have noticed for some reason, that no matter who the server, they are stingy with chips and salsa (in particular). The salsa is served in a tiny cup that is typically used for ketchup or dipping sauce. This is something that is sort of expected at a Mexican restaurant and wouldn\u2019t you want to eat the cost of this trivial item to serve more if it made your customers happy? Lately, the food has not been served hot and the order has been incorrect. I don\u2019t know of the management changing lately, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going through a rough patch or what, but I hope they restore themselves to their former glory because they have the potential to be an EXCELLENT restaurant!",

Perfect for families with ample high chairs, plenty of roomy seating, and staff that are more than welcoming and excited to see us bring in our young son. There are many kids eating here with families (especially during early evenings), and there\u2019s a great kids menu to feed them. Drinks come in little cups with a bendy straw to prevent spills, which is nice.  The food is also excellent. It feels pretty authentic for Mexico City, coming from someone that grew up in Southern California with a fantastic selection of all types of Mexican food. It fills a huge void in this city for true Mexican food. If you\u2019re from California and miss the Mexican food options that just aren\u2019t available on the east coast, give Taqueria Del Barrio a try. It\u2019s close. So very close.  I\u2019m a sucker for the cheese dip, and the amazing taquitos work well as a shared appetizer or even a main course. Try them either way. The guacamole is good, and the milanesa torta is my solid go-to when I\u2019m not on a diet. It\u2019s serious comfort food level.  There\u2019s no carry-out,  but sit down and enjoy the food and a fantastic margarita out front on the patio when it\u2019s a nice day.",
