They have such a nice selection from tacos, burritos, salads, quesadillas and desserts. I love the variety of meat options they have. The chicken quesadillas were my favorite! Wow I\u2019m still craving those! I live in LA and we have some of the best Mexican food around but I woke up today thinking about these quesadillas honestly the best I\u2019ve ever had lol. My nephew loved the steak tacos they\u2019re perfect for about 2-3 people. The shrimp taco dinner plate was so delicious and comes with rice and beans. The chimichangas wow yeah I need to another visit soon the rice, beans and cheese were so bomb and I loved the Crispiness okay yeah I\u2019m getting hungry again  I definitely recommend checking them out!

If you are looking for delicious Mexican food, look no further. I tried the Tacos Alambre Combo, see photos attached. I ordered the dinner portion which was the perfect amount. So filling. This is a must-try location! Can't make it in the restaurant? Ordering directly from the website and save 15% on your entire order. I will be back, Mixteco! Thank you for the wonderful service and fantastic meal. 5 stars across the board.",

It\u2019s located conveniently on Belmont St. in the heart of Lakeview.  It\u2019s right in between the red line/brown line stop and Clark Street.  Second, the food is very good.  I tried the works burrito with steak, chicken nachos and tres Leches Cake for dessert.  The works burrito lives up to its name as it is stuffed with ingredients.  They also did not skimp on the steak.  Next, the chicken nachos where very good.  The chicken was tender and the crispy chips were loaded with beans, cheese and guacamole.  I liked that the chips were strong enough to hold all of the ingredients.  While I enjoyed the nachos and the burrito, the true highlight of the meal was the tres leches cake I had for dessert.  It was creamy, moist and was sitting in a pool of condensed milk.  No meal is complete here without it.  Third, the staff was friendly and the service was super fast.  If you are in Lakeview, skip the Chipotle and come here.",

I saw him near me, and I saw him take the burrito (which was strange and at that point i didn't want it anymore) so I let him go. I didn't realize he took my phone, but the cashier noticed him and didn't say anything, so that's upsetting. Overall it's my fault my phone got stolen, so it's okay. It just really screwed up my trip for the week to not have a phone.  I guess this is a rant, not so much a review.  The burritos are good, and they are open late. Good place to go after bars, or if you want to meet up with a homeless person.",

When I got home ( live far southside), I had paid $14.00 for just onions and bell peppers Enchiladas... There were no other veggies inside... Also, before I had left the establishment, I had asked for a cup of ice to go...I was told there were no courtesy cups, but was offered a hard plastic drinking cup to drink water there... I was not eating there, so why would I want a cup of ice in a restaurant cup that I cannot take outside the establishment.... I just spent $14.00 and you cannot give me a regular soda cup for a cup of ice. Bad business... Will never return, plus the Vegetarian Enchiladas were horrible....there was no cheese inside, just onions and bells... cheese was on top... I had wasted my time and money visiting this establishment. I am a foodie and love to explore new food and restaurants in Chicago. I will not return to Azteca Grill..",
