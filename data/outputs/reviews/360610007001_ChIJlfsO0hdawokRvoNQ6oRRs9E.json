I hardly found them. Mistake was i just informed her the toppings and i was on call. I didnt notice when it was prepared. I asked for sauce toppings. She didn\u2019t respond and she closed the bowl. When i asked wat about the sauce, she just opened nd added on top. I m very very unhappy. And I am not coming back. This is not the way u serve a regular customer.",

Besides fresh, this location and the Broadway+Park PL location surprised me with their friendly service. I was expecting the typical \"I do not give a damn\" customer service attitude. However, the salad choppers at both locations were friendly. The Bdwy+Park PL chopper put so much care into my salad I had to tell him he was too serious, because its JUST A SALAD.  Good to know there are still fast food establishments in NYC, where the training puts emphasis on friendly and professional customer service. They convincingly earned my business.",

My new spot is now this Just Salad location.  There is nothing like having an extensive salad menu for those of us who are easily overwhelmed by more than three options. If your prefer your own masterpiece, they have you covered there as well with a spread of fixings for your perusal. Also noteworthy is the long list of interesting dressings. I can have a completely different salad every day with so many choices without fear of burnout.  If you want to save some money or the environment (or both!) they offer reusable  colorful bowls you bring back for two free toppings, though I still need to warm to the idea of walking around Manhattan with a bowl.  Where do I put it?  Service is quick and staff is very friend.  Don't let the chaotic lines during lunch hour scare you away.This is after all the Financial District where people literally grab-and-go dine.  This has been my salad spot for a couple weeks and I highly recommend it.",
