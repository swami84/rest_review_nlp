Let me remind you we sat in front of  the other location for 20 minutes. It took us 15 minutes to get there. A total of 35 minutes. And when we got there it still wasn\u2019t ready. But I couldn\u2019t help but notice that there was no a/c. The employees were sweating profusely! It definitely was 95 degrees or more. It has to be going against some labor laws. Fast forward 15 minutes, finally ready. First time trying the chicken and shrimp Alfredo (i usually get chicken Wings and 2 sides but their sides are so salty). The sliced chicken and shrimp was good but the pasta had no flavor and it was watery.",

I traveled 30 mins to support another Sister in business only to wait 2hrs when I was told 45 mins, totally Unprofessional  and Disrespectful. The carry out was not clean, and 120 degrees inside when ordering your food.  I truly applaud the workers for working under such poor conditions. No chair to sit in outside or given a bottle of water , tea etc to show some kind of appreciation for the  customers waiting for over an hour or more just like me. I\u2019m sorry! But you can\u2019t go on social media for the money and not Deliver a Professional Service especially when your charging  restaurant prices.... NO MA\u2019AM!! When running a business you want to perfect the first one before starting a second one. Our goal in business is ALWAYS  to please the customer!! You seem to have a great team! But they Must be APPRECIATED!! They should not have to work in such poor conditions they\u2019re the ones who help bring in your business by cooking tasteful dishes. I will say my food (salmon & shrimp  Alfredo was really good - but my crab leg was not fresh). My daughters stuffed chicken was okay,  not the best. But again after a two hour wait we were told they ran out of collards greens \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14I only hope that you take this as a help and not a insult. I really appreciate Chef Steven who I met there and gave his warmest apologies and offer me a cold drink, free desert and refunded one of my meals. I pray that as you continue to grow that you become more customer conscious of our time. This wait literally cause some of my plans to be cancelled for that day. Again my time is valuable just like yours. Thanks again to Chef Steven! And your team of cooks... I pray your environment becomes workable and comfortable soon.  Customer!!",

The food is usually immaculate. However, these last couple visits, not so much. We just went yesterday and we always order over $100 worth of food because we like to have leftovers for the next day. However, this experience will be our last. First, I called my order in because it takes us an hour to get there, and the wait time given was 35 minutes. Knowing them from past experiences and their inaccurate time guess-timations, we made a few stops and went on our merry way. It took us a little over 2 hours to get there, while close in route, we receive a call that 3 sides we ordered were no longer available. Really? Okay, things happen. We replaced and arrived to the location to find our order not ready. Mind you, 2 hours had passed. Strike 1. Next, going in to pick up the food, there was zero air in the place. ZERO! I was sweating profusely while awaiting my order, so you can imagine, so were the workers. Sweating...while cooking my food...and prepping my food...and packing my food.  Strike 2. Lastly, we get home, ready to dig in, only for the food to be HEAVILY salted and overly sweet. The chicken wings, turkey wings, string beans were so much so salted, that we couldn't finish the items. The yams and corn bread were entirely too sweet, also couldn't finish. The fettuccine with whiting, and steak was tasty. But Strike 3 for me. So we won't be returning. Overall service was a no for me as well but I don't hold that against them because as hot as it was, I too, would be irritable and short fused.",

Waited over an hour to get 4 lamb lollipops and 4 small shrimp (had flavor on shrimp and lollipops but absolutely no flavor on yellow rice) for $26.00.  Last time I came they were rude and didn't want to take my order laughing and being unwelcoming.  The portions are small. They only had yams and mac as sides.  TIP: work on customer service and add more staffing to get customers out in under 30 min., make portions bigger for price, add seasoning to your sides. Add more veggie sides. Don't yell, telling your customers to get out, be tactful/respectful when enforcing social distancing rules, we are supporting you so be mindful of our experiences.  Thank you.",

The first issue was we received a call stating that a side wasn't available and that was the seafood salad. At this point collard greens were chosen, once the food arrived we had to walk out to the car to get the food. On the platter one had collard greens and the other had doubled mac n cheese that wasn't requested. For both orders the Lamb chops was pink pink in the middle and I'm confused. I'm truly truly upset and very disappointed, because I've seen the reviews, that is one of the reasons why my supervisor chose to order our lunch from you all. We called and was not able to speak to a manager at all but I can honestly say the staff was very pleasant. We also requested well done I'm confused. The mac n cheese had so much grease at the bottom I wasn't even hungry anymore the fact that this was my lunch that I couldn't eat. I will not recommend this place to nobody period. The only reason why you have one star from me is because Google make you hit a star just to leave a review and FYI maybe Ms Carter should come in to cook herself IJS\ud83d\udc40",

I am a dasher, I deliver for Doordash. I had a customer yesterday who had a dasher before me but the original dasher abandoned their order. I had no idea why nor did I know I was this customer's second dasher. I'm just trying to work and make money for my family.  This customer was full of rage. I calmed her down and assured her that I will not abandon her order and I will bring her order to her. I quickly got to Miss Carters, excited that I turned around an ugly situation. This Customer was waiting and hour and a half already, surely her order would be ready by now. Unfortunately I was wrong.  When I walked in, I said \"hello, I have an order pickup for -customer-\" and the lady behind the window rolled her eyes and said \"it ain't done and won't be done till its done.\" Then walked away and proceeded to ignore m  I was baffled. I just calmed down this customer for this establishment and I'm being attacked unprovoked. I try to get her attention in an attempt to explain the situation and how I found a way to make it better and she doesn't give me the light of day. The restaurant phone rings and when she answers it, it's my customer. I'm seriously standing there like \"what is going on, I'm here trying to warn you about that very customer your talking to and how hangry she is and you cant get out of your own world to listen?!\"  Instead of acknowledging me, she pointed to a rude sign that reads \"Food take 15 to 25 mins Regular Time. 35 to 50 mins When We Are Busy. If You Don't Have Any Patience $ Please Don't Order. Thanks Chef Carter!!\" Like then what happens when it's been 2 HOURS!!  She seriously had no value for me as someone bringing money to this takeout place (which pays her checks) or the customer putting the money into it. This place is a problem. I absolutely understand why the original dasher left! They didn't have time to waste for basically no pay. I gave my word so I stuck it out.  When locations like these take forever, we lose money. When customers get angry, our ratings go down which means we lose money and maybe even lose our jobs as dashers. We need to be able to deliver food on time.  You people working at Miss Carters may devalue your customers and prefer that chill slow life but don't drag us down with you. We have no choice but to be on time. Our pay and our jobs depend on it.

I immediately called and it took me 8 times to get an answer and hearing that the voicemail is full. Once I did get a person I explained to her that they had charged me $48.72 twice. She put me on hold for approximately 15 minutes. She came back on the phone to explain to me where she sees the transaction put through only once. I once again informed her what my account says. Her response was you have to go through your bank to get there mistake fixed. I informed her that I now have a hold on my account for two charges and I had written checks on this account. Thank God it is not an account that I use all the time. I use it for transactions such as this. The young lady asked for my phone number and said someone would be calling me back. I then said you are getting ready to hang up and you did not even ask my name. I said  don't you need my name  to call me back?  It is 9:13 am the next day and I have heard nothing. Honor your word. They did not.  I do understand that it is a business and they are constantly busy. In my opinion the food is great. I do agree the customer service behind the counter needs much help. You can stand there for 5 minutes or more before someone takes your order. You try to place a order over the phone and you do not get an answer. That can be frustrating. My husband and I love there food and it is convenient to where I work and park my car.  I say this to Miss Carter's Kitchen: Customer service is monumental in running a business. Your establishment lacks that. If you make a mistake with a customer be humble and own it.  Maybe you should take some of the money you are making and send your staff to some type of customer service training. Customers should be treated fairly and respected when they are spending there hard earned money in your establishment. Please remember customers make your business successful.  I work in customer service in a Human Resouce office for the State. We have applicants come in off the street looking for work. We have applicants come in for background investigations and we are reminded that customer service and respect are key in our office. On our voicemails it states that we have stepped away from our desk and we will return your call. It is a major part of our job duties to do this.  I never post reviews but that is the only way I could let you know how I feel. I am going to straighten out my account and I will probably never hear from anyone. Everyone be careful using your bank card there.",

Unfortunately its generally a miss.Especially when it comes to the collar greens and mac & cheese. I cant even eat it sometimes.  I assume the cooks switch out and one time right before closing the greens and mac were amazing. But haven't been able to get that batch again. Yams are the safe choice. Still highly recommend!",

Customer service is horrible, workers sit behind the counter and chat with one another non stop, and workers show favoritism to customers who they are familiar with; however the food does smell great. I placed my order, and after an hour of waiting and finally inquiring about my order, the cooks realized they hadn\u2019t even started it yet, get started without even acknowledging me at all. I got my food (which was for my gf) and saw that there definitely was not a lot of food for the cost. I thought that this experience may have been a one time fluke for me, so I looked through the reviews (something I should\u2019ve done initially) and saw that many other people have had similar experiences. And what sealed the fate of the restaurant for me was when the owner responded to one of the reviewers and pretty much chastised the reviewer for her experience. Like what kind of service is that, really??? I can\u2019t support a company like that ever. Hopefully things improve for this business",

Mac&Cheese should not sit in oil and be super greasy. The location in downtown Baltimore was absolutely disgusting. They have a thick layer of grease and oil on the fryer and I didn't see it before I paid for my food. I just prayed to God that I do not get sick from eating there. The counters were gross and the ceiling looks like 15 years of oil grease was on it. The place is super grungy. The only reason I'm eating my food is because they did put gloves on when they handled the food. I saw some Glad plastic containers (the ones from Wal-Mart) that there were serving food from. They were not refrigerated or sitting somewhere clean, they just sat it on top of their the back countertop. This is a very, very nasty location. They really need to take some money and close for a weekend and clean this disgusting place up. There is no reason for I to be so gross. Off street parking.  The only saving Grace was that the fried Catfish was fried perfectly. That's likely why their still in business. Just clean this place up!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is absolutely no reason for it to be so disgusting. Also, take some food service classes on food storage before you make somebody sick and they contact the health department!!",

Uber Eats canceled my order without reaching out to me and no one attempted to fix the situation on either end.  I try to support black owned businesses but these are the shenanigans that make people go to big businesses that understand customer service. On the other hand, Uber has lost my business period! I will use one of their competitors for regular Uber and Eats.  Who has the time and energy to wait nearly  50 mins for a delivery for it only to be canceled? Not me!

I responded to the location in person and placed an order for a stuffed chicken breast meal and waited over an hour for preparation. The business was completely empty when I arrived, other patrons entered ordered their meals and received them within 15 min. When Inquired about my meal I was given no explanation for it not being prepared. Finally I requested a refund and my meal miraculously appeared. Next, other patrons continued to tell me about their meals and how delicious they are so I decided to give it another try(everyone has a bad day),this time I ordered via Uber eats. I received a message my meal was being prepared, waited the estimated time and decided to track my order, only to find out the meal was cancelled. I called the establishment and spoke with someone with a not so nice disposition who advised they didnt have any of the food I requested and didnt have time to call and offer me another option. Moreover, I will not be patronizing this business again for any reason. The customer service is despicable.",
