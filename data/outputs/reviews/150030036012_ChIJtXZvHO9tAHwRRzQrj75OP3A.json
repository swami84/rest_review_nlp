Said it was the best he had so far in Hawaii. I also had their strawberry shortcake and thought it was ok (had better).  Now on to the custom cupcakes! The design of the cupcakes were ADORABLE. Just what we had asked for. However, upon the first bite I was left confused. I clearly remembered ordering cupcakes, not corn bread. It wasn't even good corn bread. Super dry. The butter cream frosting tasted like room temp butter mixed with sugar. (I love frosting btw so not biased!)  All in all, a huge disappointment because if I wanted corn bread, I would just go Zippys and not pay $5 per. I think their custom cakes are probably ok (based on the strawberry shortcake).. but I would give the cupcakes a hard pass. Do try the cream puffs though.  (The 2 stars is for the cream puffs and design of the cupcakes.)",
