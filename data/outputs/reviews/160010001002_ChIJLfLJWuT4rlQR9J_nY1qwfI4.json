I thought that the sweet potato was a bit peculiar but i thought 'what the heck, could be worse'. The sandwich was amazing! I could have eaten two if i didn't have the salad on the side and the rest of my wife's salad as well. The sandwich seemed to have the right amount of everything. Normally i prefer my cheese to be melted but the Swiss was the right amount and paired well with the herbed aioli and sprouts. The sweet potato and avocado finished the sandwich with a sweet smoothness i find myself craving note as i write this. Now on to the salad my wife ordered; potatoes in a salad, really? Not sure what to think. This is idaho, it was good but still wonder how this came about. It is appropriately named the idaho club and was delicious as well! I usually don't get bacon on or in many things so picked the pieces out but the dressing was amazing. The combo of the ingredients were delicious. I would recommend this deli, the prices are in line with the amount you get but the flavor will push it up a notch.",

I got the Latina Insalada and a cup of broccoli cheddar soup and OMG, it was so good. They let me have a small sample of soup before ordering it too! At one point the owner came over to see how everything was and happened to find out one of my sisters hadn't tried beets since she was a kid. He went right over and grabbed a sample of 2 different kinds of beets for her to try! Talk about customer service! :-) I'll be recommending Main Street Deli to everyone!",

Awesome meat, slaw, sauce and absolutely love the bread it comes on. Rivaling it's awesomeness was the music playlist the owners were rocking...memories of late grade school abound! Nice to meet you and see you again soon, MSD!",
