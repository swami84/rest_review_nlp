Let me address each one separately.  The cleanliness issue.  When I first arrived in the place I had to visit the boys room. One can really see the cleanliness by looking at the details of the washroom. For instance, at this restaurant the floor is splattered with drippings from the toilet as well as the urinal.  This is then walked in by the customer who take that same urine to the part where one eats. Rather bothersome to me and anyone else who wants to indulge in a good meal.  The food...  Unlike the other part, the food doesn't need as much work. It's actually pretty good. I had the Santa Fe which had chicken and much salad goodies. Some of the lettuce was wilted but for the most part it was good.  Overall consideration...  Being handicapped I dont expect people to help but do appreciate when they do. For instance, I had say at the table with a friend of mine who is also physically challenged.  We were both made to get up and walk about 20 feet to the place where a lady was standing. This would have easily been addressed if someone could help and take an order at the table. That wasn't done.  They did bring our food to the table.  Recommendations...  Not more than a few building away is a senior center, yet there were none in the place besides us. Something is wrong with that picture. Seniors love coffee and pastries yet those that  are shown online are not available.  Judge for yourself. Maybe I'll come here again in a few months but then again....",

Honestly, the salads and burgers have been the most decent. But what really bothers me is that almost every time I order, the meal is very different from what the menu states. Grilled means flat top pan fried. Panini means regular white bread. Cheese sticks once came with no cheese and all breading. What I am getting at, is that they half-a** your order. My suggestion to the manager is just have your cooks follow the menu as described. Customers appreciate fast service, but most importantly, food as they ordered it.  Overall, I'll still order here. It's convenient and not completely bad. Just beware. Your expectations AS THE MENU LISTS will not be met.",

When we stepped through the door we were greeted by a very friendly young lady at the front counter so we proceeded to order I got the gyros plate my mom and daughter got some really yummy looking burgers the food came and I was totally amazed with my meal so much food on the plate I spoke to the owner while we were ordering he was very nice and very handsome lol so we ate I couldn't believe I ate everything on my plate i really was hungry but all in all everything was delicious i asked the owner if they deliver he said yes but his comment was even better he said it would be nicer if I come back to the restaurant \ud83d\ude0d",
