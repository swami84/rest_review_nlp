My sandwich took approx an hour and 1/2 to arrive. I contacted store location after an hour of waiting and young woman said driver had 4 other deliveries along with mine on his outing and that he should arrive shortly?? Driver never notified me or knocked on door as per instructions to let me know my order had arrived; I just happened to check after an hour and a half. The sandwich looked a bit disheveled. Also, the day before I placed an order on the website for delivery approx. 10 minutes prior to the store closing. I was phoned by the store advising me they could not honor my order because they had closed everything up. I was charged for sandwich and I am still awaiting a refund to my card. I would recommend some sort of cutoff time when ordering from the website prior to store closing or redirecting you to the closest location for delivery.",

While there eating my sandwich, I noticed the 2 employees standing face-to-face talking about 3 feet apart not wearing masks. I pointed out to them the necessity of wearing masks and socially distancing and they informed me that they did not have to since they were working there together. I share with them that over 250,000 Americans have died from Covid. Those facts did not matter to them. I took a photo and a couple videos documenting the situation and they became loud and belligerent toward me. They told me that I have been banned from their location, and called the police to have me arrested for trespassing. When the police arrived, I promptly left the store, but also explained the situation to them. My next step is to report this location to the St. Louis Health Department and ask that this location\u2019s license be suspended.",

After 40 minutes of not getting the sandwich and then receiving notification that it had been delivered, I called the store,  the employees forgot to place me on hold and instead argued about whose responsibility it was to deliver the sandwich/ make sure it was delivered.  Employee came back and said they had a misunderstanding and that it was \"walking out the door right now\"  40 more minutes go by, I call again, the employee says the person delivering my sandwich had their bike break when they were part way to me, so they had to come back and get a new bike.  I live 3 blocks away....... their line of thinking was to get nearly halfway to me, turn around and prolong this already absurdly long delivery.  Great work",

I didn't receive my lunch until 12:25 which means I either going have to eat my lunch real fast or take a few bites before I go back to work or just not eat my lunch at all! I have ordered lunch from here before without ever a issue and I know they come on bikes so this last order which was today I gave a little more on the tip side which nobody deserved. I did call and spoke to someone before my food showed up and told them that I wasn't happy I didn't go off or act crazy I was cool about it they apologized so I ask to talk to the manager but he was busy so they said they would have him or she call me back, never received that call. I work for a construction company and we do work all over the city I'm also a Union member, I will be letting people know about this Jimmy John's and I probably won't be eating Jimmy John's anymore no matter how much I like it especially since the manager didn't return my call customer appreciation goes a long way.

Called twice and was pretty much given excuses as to why it was late (the rain, only two drivers, etc.) I understand you are busy and short staffed, but an automated system should be in place if your order is delayed. I received no apologies. Won't be utilizing this location anymore. Shame they've lost out on a ton of catering orders.",

Naturally, I call to check the status of the order because I did receive a text notification that the amount has been taken out of my account from Jimmy Johns of $11.50.  Apparently they never received my order because there was an issue with the online website.  They suggest I contact their corporate office to resolve at $11.50 issue.  What a joke.  No compensation, no apology, horrible customer service.  I'm very disappointment with my experience here and guarantee my business will be taken elsewhere.",

But at least when they finally brought us the food, they also didn't apologize or acknowledge that they took over an hour to bring us 2 sandwiches and drinks. We won't be ordering from them again.
