The hash browns were perfectly done and crispy. We also ordered Kale & Parmesan Biscuits & Gravy with dill and parsley garnish. Don\u2019t take my word for it or how good the photo looks, give them a try. You will not be disappointed. The biscuits were crispy and the gravy was delicious! Highly recommend and will definitely go back here again! The staff was covid friendly and had sanitizers and outdoor seating available.",

The cool thing about it is that they serve a mixture of Asian and Classic US cuisine. Yoo's mushroom Reuben quesadilla ($14) is awesome. The greasy tortilla taste did not stand out at first, but when dipped in pink Russian seasoning, the oozing dishes were like the best drinking sides in the world. The wonton ($13) has a layer of pork dumplings, topped with a stack of shredded cheese and elegant mushroom slices, sprinkled with cardamom powder. It feels as refreshing as minestrone soup or Yankee bean soup. We are lucky to have Yoo bring us next time we have the flu. Diners are also not known for their excellent pasta, but the hearty, curly Taiwanese noodles ($18) are so eye-catching they may become the belt in the next Gucci collection-will make you reconsider. Although the taste of vognole is not as salty as its stewed clam dish, the fermented black bean sauce is precisely a home-cooked dish we don\u2019t know. Golden Diner was always famous for its picturesque location with a great spot near the Manhattan Bridge. The area is vibrant, yet pleasant.",

After seeing how busy the Brockport diner was on Sunday November 1st, a friend of mine and I decided to try this diner out again. There was no wait to sit down but the wait for food was 45 minutes at least. We ordered normal breakfast food and there were orders going out ahead of us. Not only that, but the food was terrible, terrible service, and when we ask to get water filled up, the waitress came back over and when she poured the water, it splashed into my face. With no apology. This was the first time we didn't give a tip and I guess I'll just have to try again in another 5 years, if it's even still around \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

The drinks are super creative but maybe I was expecting a bigger serving for the price or they charged for the quality of the ingredients. The cocktail itself was pretty top.",

The pricing is reasonable, which I'm thankful for, but that might be a function of the location.  The food volume amd quality to price is what will keep me coming back. What will make me reluctant is the wait time to get a seat, but that's mainly on the weekends.  Really nice staff and they don't make you feel le they are doing you a favor for dining at their space. I really hope the staff keeps up the good karma.  The food is tasty, filling, and thrilling to look at.  Overall, I recommend!",

The combination of Taiwanese noodles, black bean sauce, and clams with breadcrumbs is savory and addictive. The noodles have great bite to them as well.  The kale and Parmesan biscuits and gravy are another thing you should definitely order. The chicken gravy is really good (leaning on salty), but the real star is the biscuits. They almost have the texture of a pound cake \u2014 really dense but somehow also very fluffy. Those biscuits alone are worth ordering the dish for.  The vegetalian hero is massive, but you can comfort yourself by saying it\u2019s all veggies anyway.  Service is efficient and friendly. Decor is on theme without being too campy. Beware of loud trains passing overhead, which might interrupt conversation.",

My GF took me there and she recommended me to get the burger, excellent choice and must get the special sauce (extra $2, but it\u2019s worth it) and she got the Chinese breakfast sandwich. Food was amazing, service was incredible and loved the spanish music. I loved the mixed culture feeling as soon as I stepped in. Friendly staff all together and super cool.",

I think they do Yelp waitlist so definitely do that to save yourself some time.  My partner and I came on a Saturday night at 6ish and there was no wait. However, more people started showing up as we were halfway through our meal so it does get filled up later in the night.  For food I got the seasonal bibimbap and my partner got the chicken Katsu sando. The bibimbap used fresh seasonal veggies and used some type of grain I don\u2019t remember. The portion was a bit small but the flavors were strong. I think it was vegan friendly too so if you\u2019re looking for that then this is a good option. I think they are well known for their chicken Katsu sando and I could see why. First off, it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s very filling even for one person. My favorite part was the chicken and the slaw. The chicken was juicy and had a nice crunch. The slaw with the bulldog sauce was so good. Tangy and crunchy. For dessert we got their seasonal apple bingsoo. It was refreshing and if you like apples it\u2019s like eating apple pie! Will have to come back to try more of their menu!",

The small vegan burrito that our friend had was super expensive ($19 because of vegan cheese, egg tofu replacement & added avocado).

Found this place online and after seeing pictures of the chicken katsu club sandwich, I knew I had to go there. Luckily I had to fly to NYC for a wedding. So this place was my #1 spot I had to visit. The flight from Korea to NYC is roughly 13 hours, but after eating here, the travel time was worth it. Clean facilities and a friendly staff just add to the simple fact that the food here is amazing. The chicken katsu club was everything I expected and more. Luckily my wife and the groom to be accompanied me when I came here so I got to try bites of their food. My wife got the breakfast sandwich, and wow, that scrambled egg in the sandwich. Just so delicious. My friend loved it so much, that he went the next day for lunch with his family. It was great to show a New Yorker a great New York restaurant. Overall, if you want delicious diner food. Go here. If you want great delicious diner food with a twist. Go here. If you just want delicious food, you need to go the Golden Diner.",

The quality is supreme which makes all the difference with simple breakfast foods. Sam checked the temperature and quality of every burrito and sandwich and would send it back or prepare it again if it did not reach his standards.  The egg sandwich was a soft bun with a crunchy hash brown toast and melt in your mouth eggs. The combination of textures was amazing and delicious.  The burrito was delicious, with pico de gallo creating a different taste sensation when combined with hash crunch, eggs and soft wrap.  Golden Diner sure to become my favorite regular spot although it's sure to become super crazy popular soon which will make it tough. Enjoy!!!",

How do they do a burger?Server took my order and oddly didnt ask for a temp i assumed because he didnt ask it would come out medium It came out rare Its just not healthy eating raw beef I asked for more fire and they burned it It was charcoal I couldnt eat it and asked for the check and to be fair to them they didnt charge me How do you screwup a burger it's just so easy Guys I've eaten in dozens of diners growing up in Queens and I'm in the restaurant business so this was just so sad because everyone seemed nice enough and it's right in the neighborhood I'll take my money elsewhere",

Really surprisingly tasty and special. Came on a Sunday and the place had super chill, good vibes. We waited maybe 15 min for our table of 6. Great music/ambiance (old school r&b and some hip hop), nice crowd, friendly service. I met the chef/owner Sam who was right behind the counter cooking our meal. Great classic diner spot with a modern Asian twist. Pro tip: The matcha coffee cake is extra matcha-y and not overly sweet (exactly as I like it)! Price is right too. Totally affordable. I had a really positive experience and am coming back in a couple weeks haha. A true new gem!",
