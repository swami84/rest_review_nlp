The kimchi fries had so much flavor. The bulgogi was fantastic and well seasoned!  It was delicious. We do want to go back and eventually try more.",

The first time we had a variety of things like the kimchi fries, wings, galbitang and pork belly which were all delicious! The second time we got the wings and galbitang. And the last time we got the wings and the jjampong.  The wings progressively got worse for some reason. Maybe it was the delivery or different chefs, idk. But the jjampong for some reason the soup and the noodles came together in the same container so by the time it got to me, there was barely any soup left and the noodles were mad soggy. Plus, there wasn't much flavor to the jjampong as I was expecting. Maybe it's to cater to those who can't handle spiciness or something, but it was more than that -- there was a lack of depth to it overall.  Get the wings and kimchi fries! Don't get the jjampong.",

I had a morsel of her tofu: it indeed only tasted like the charred aftermath of a California wildfire. They had no potatoes so we could neither order the kimchi fries not the truffle fries. I ordered a $4 homemade limeade only to receive simply syrup, seltzer water, and a 1/4 slice of lime.

Because when I go for Italian or French how am I gonna know if one is authentic or not.I might fall in love with some Italian or French which are not authentic at all. I get to somewhat agree with Brian Kim's opinion below when I scroll down the google review.

For today, the kimchi has gone bad. It's beyond sour. I had budaejjigae for once, it tasted disgusting. It litereally tasted like a vomit. So I tried to kimchi itself, and you can definitely tell the kimchi has gone bad. It tastes like they turned off the kimchi fridge or something for long time. It was disgusting. I am Korean Asian myself, and I know what kimchi tastes like. For O-Sam, they don't stir-fry squid and pork together. So the squid doesn't have any sauce inside or cooked. For kimchi pork and tofu, since the kimchi has gone bad.. you can imagine how it tasted. DON'T EAT HERE. I won't come back here even if the food is free. I'd rather have a cheap cup noddle since at least it's not disgusting.",

I visited on an early Friday afternoon and there was not a ton of people inside, much how I like it since that means immediate seating and less noise overall. The menu, for some reason is on these letter sized papers attached to a clipboard. I personally don't mind this at all, but others who are nitpicky may see this and immediately think poorly of the restaurant's quality, but I can assure you, the quality is top notch. Prices are pretty reasonable for most items on the menu and serving sizes are fairly big. I ended up ordering the Oh-Sam (the only thing on the menu with a fairly high price) and the shrimp fried rice. The Oh-Sam, which is fried calamari and pork belly with vegetables, arrived steaming hot on one of those cast iron-like plates where the food continues to sizzle and cook in front of you. It's mostly for show, but the only drawback is the food is HOT, and stays too hot for a while. The fried rice was served the same way. Both were absolutely delicious and outstanding. We complimented the food with a bottle of Sake, which was also amazing. Overall I can easily recommend this place. It's so delicious and so fairly priced.",

On a Friday night, the place is not super packed. I can easily get a booth table enough for 4 or more. This spot ended up as a perfect date spot. With the correct ambiance and deal on drinks, we had a great time. Beside not having to yell at each other and overhearing someone else conversation, the waiters are so nice.  Food is delicious. We just got some tapas including their wing, kimchi pancake and some pork belly. Their Seoul mule is strong and huge which is well worth the $11 or $6 happy hour special. It's equal to two drink size tbh. The hot toddy is decent but I would go for something else.  Wing is pretty good. I think they need to be marinated a bit more as the flavor isn't all the way into the meat. The kimchi pancake is a bit sad due to the size and it's not midtown quality. They need some more work or a better recipe. This place has potential but need more work on their food of course. The bar is a good deal and drinks are on point. The noodle we had come in a sizzling hot plate but it ends up burned at the bottom. Good show but not ideal for eating.  Service is 100 %. Everyone is super nice.",

The Banchan (small starter dishes) typically given to start off meals was the smallest amount I've ever seen with two tiny bowls of Kimchi. You get like 6 or 7 in Manhattan.  - The Pajun (scallion pancake) was nice. - JapChae was decent, but definitely better at other places. - The Sundubu soup was good flavor, but the meat was chewy - The fried Steak and Eggs cooked Dolsot style was the best dish. The crispy rice was flavored exceptionally well. The meat had the same issue being soft and chewy, but flavored well. Had me wonder meat quality to be this chewy  The big kicker was the spotty service. It IS very slow. We thought they were forgot our order at one point as the couple seated right before us were able to eat and receive their bill before we got our first dish. We waited almost 40min for the first order to arrive (the appetizer scallion pancake) during a lunch that was not busy at all around 1:10pm on a Sunday. They also gave us a wrong dish during this time.",

Literally had to go and ask for the bill both times. The staff here have no business working in food service - inattentive and zero concern for their customers. Thought it would be better to order the food in and avoid the inexcusably bad service - wrong. Order was delayed twice by over an hour. No one would pick up at the restaurant after eleven calls and eventually had to get seamless to settle the issue for us. Turns out they are on Seamless but don\u2019t have any delivery drivers?!?!? Incredible food, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll get it. And in a year they will wonder why they are out of business. Would not recommend - our last time EVER here. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.",
