There\u2019s no system for pickup- you just give your name to the staff member at the door- so people skip ahead in the nonexistent line (clump) and others are left waiting for ages. I think it would benefit everyone if there was a better pickup system. Perhaps the staff member at the door could take multiple names at once instead of bringing sandwiches out one by one, there could be tape on the ground for distancing/queuing purposes, etc. We love the sandwiches but it\u2019s been tough to stand in the sun with a baby for 20 minutes just to pickup an online order.",

They have a great variety of sandwiches that can satisfy any type of taste buds.  The only issue is the bread is very hard, so biting and chewing into the sandwich will be a problem, and they don't have a wheat or multigrain bread option.  They operate on an honor system when it comes to paying for your meal which can be a problem because after you order your food; you have to go to a separate area to pay for the sandwich and verbally tell the cashier what you ordered.  Normally they give you a ticket of some sort at other deli's, but they don't practice that here; so I would recommend they track their purchases.  Parking here will definitely be a problem, so I highly recommend a car sharing service, taxi or public transportation if you are dining in.  With all that being said; the sandwiches are definitely great and this store is certainly worth dining in at.",

I had to walk for almost about a mile in the cold windy streets of the west loop and all of my efforts and wait were totally going to be worth it. As i reached the store I was greeted with their customary style at the deli counter and at the payment counter, you get a feeling of belongingness and a comfort zone with this place. I decided to go with their famous Mr. G which was quite a big sub for the price. Mr. G has their unique hot oil sauce which has flavours of mustard, balsamic and truffle oil that provide a distinct flavour to the sandwich. The meat is very fresh and the marinated artichoke with lettuce soaked in oregano amd vinegrette would make you crave for more. The basil on top does provide that unique fresh taste and blends well with the entire package. All in all this was one of my best subs in the chicagoland area and does leave a unique flavour for you to remind about what JP Graziano\u2019s is all about.",

I grabbed a sandwich to go from JPG's - a prosciutto sandwich specifically. Now, not being a fan of tomatoes, I asked them to substitute giardinere instead. But when I got home and dug in, I didn't really notice it - in fact, I think they forgot it altogether (though the sandwich was sans tomato, which was a good thing!).  The bread was good, the prosciutto could have been a little more robust. I plan to try the place again - I honestly feel a bit like an outcast with the three star review, but I've had better sandwiches at Capri in River Forest, Alpine and Al & Joes.",
