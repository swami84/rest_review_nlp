It was also a tske mom on a date night and catch a show at sheas across the street. We didnt make a reservation but were able to seat quickly. The dinner selections were amazing.   The crab cakes were perfect. Nice snd hot and well cooked. The salad and dressing was also delicious with the crab cakes. I had the lobster ravioli and it was delicious. The kids crushed their meals (flat bread pizza and home made penne with meatballs) also the fresh table bread and finished it off with their brownie sunday. Kids literally licked their plates clean which rarely happens its usually a fight to eat all their food. Service was amazing and drinks were perfect. Even just a dounle whiskey and cola was done to perfection. The perfect amount of each slight taste of whiskey slight taste of cola. Rarely do i leave a restaurant having the perfect experience but had one this night. Thanks bijou! We are never disappointed when dinning with you but this night was just perfection on everything! The only thing i would say as a con is the beer selection. Would have liked to see more local stuff from resurgence woodcock and the likes but not enough to ever stop me from coming back.",

I didn't like seeing the older women (maybe the owner) standing by the cooks area hovering while staring at all of us in that tiny room Let me say she didn't ever look happy and she never greeted anyone with a smile on her face.. I felt very uncomfortable. I had pecan chicken crusted chicken salad, the chicken was good but there was just a med amount of the spring mix lettuce 4oz of chicken and gorgonzola cheese that's it.. I thought kind of small for the price and it really was just good not really good. I won't be back and big part of the reason is the woman/owner/managers presence at all times",

After our waitress finally brought us our food, she came by to check on us once, and then we didn't see her again for another half hour. While sitting around waiting for service, we noticed other people looking around for a waitress, and trying to get their attention. When our waitress finally appeared again, we ordered the chocolate LAVA cake. Supposed to be warm, right? The cake was cold, as was the \"lava\" inside the cake. Then when it came time for the bill, we had to get up and physically go ask for it because it was taking so long, and we were running out of time. I will never come back, nor recommend it to anyone.",

We ordered our food with our drinks as we wanted to enjoy our meal. It took over and hour food to arrive (restaurant wasn\u2019t at capacity). When our food came I requested our bill as I knew service was terrible, I had to ask twice and even though we asked for separate bills he brought one check. By this time we had 10 minutes to show time, I just quickly paid still tipped him and left. Next day reviewing the bill I see he charged us $19 for a meal we never got. My sister initially ordered the Chicken caprese gluten free, he came back 15 minutes later to say can\u2019t guarantee its gluten free so she changed to Caponatina pasta but our incompetent Robert never removed it from the check. We were in such a rush I didn\u2019t notice we were over charged. Poor service, decent food and over billed. I will never eat here ever again.",

Herb oil and bread were a good start but the food itself was pretty disappointing for the price point.  With tip $35 for the two items pictured. The first a sample of their meatballs (soft with good texture, but very bland) and stuffed pepper (again bland but slightly cheesier filling) for I believe $9. The other was their chicken caprese. Two small medallions of chicken and 1-1.5 cups of orzo. Pretty meager portion and one dimensional flavor for $19.  My dinner compatriot got their spaghetti and meatballs which oddly came with two smaller meatballs (maybe 50% smaller, just as bland) and watery 'marinara'",
