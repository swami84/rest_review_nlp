Was at the bar twice, one time got two drinks ( captain morgan and sprite ) paid 24$. But some guy bumped in to me and my drink fell so I went to get another one and payed 12$. But on Monday I was shocked to see that I was charged 24$ as supposed to but for the second time 42$! Well I did not purchase any other drinks and definitely not left a 30$ tip. I always leave tip in cash! I called this place on Tuesday around 9 pm to asked to do investigation on this, and a nice guy who said he was manager for that night took my information and said that someone will contact me. Well no one did, so I called on Thursday again and no one had a clue what I\u2019m talking about and I had to explain my self again, and of course they took information again and said someone will call back. NO ONE DID! I wanted to resolve this with them with out doing dispute on credit card but I guess they don\u2019t care. It\u2019s sad because the place it self is very nice, but the way the operate is sad. Just check your credit cards after you visit this place.",

The bar tender at the main bar couldn\u2019t keep up and became flustered and rude. Everyone needed to have their drinks remade because it was pure water with a splash of alcohol. They messed up a vodka lemonade numerous times. They were also extremely slow taking orders and getting their drinks and food out. They ran out of clean glasses and started reusing dirty ones thinking no one would notice. To make matters worse I went to the other bar and the girls kept informing me that my card was saying invalid for a $35 charge. I used a credit card with a high limit so I knew that was impossible. I then get an alert stating she tried to charge my card $3,500 twice. So my credit card company flagged it and declined it. It\u2019s hey frustrating to try to get out and have a good time when the establishment you\u2019re paying is rude and negligent. To make matters worse we had a vip section",

Dancers and performers seemed to be overbooked for a mum night (and the performers performed halfheartedly at that). Drinks were good and fairly priced, but a signature cocktail wasn't available on a Saturday night (!!) due to \"not having gotten around to preparing infusions I guess\" quoting the waitress. Lastly and most importantly, for a sky bar, the lounge is on the 6th floor of Michigan Ave with the only area accessible to the windows roped off for VIPs. You can't meander over, drink in hand, to enjoy the view. It's a sham to be marketed as a sky lounge with no view. Will do if strictly contained to the South Loop. Otherwise, head to River North for a better scene and better rooftop lounges.",

So it felt like at any moment the tone of the room could switch and this swarm of attentive gracious men could become a pack of entitled assaulters. It put me on edge.  Other than that the service was fine, the food was acceptable (not great), the cocktails were terrific (and pricey), the view was amazing.  The jury is out on the decor of the room. Most in my group thought it was weird. I thought it was pleasingly eclectic ... if they had stopped with 2 fewer elements. Its just too busy, with the crushed velvet AND the floral upholstery AND the purple mod sofas AND the shrub-covered wall AND the Asian inspired woodwork AND the space-age plastic AND the brass wall hangings ....",

She did a great job preventing him from getting wet by spilling them all over herself. She didn't let it effect her attitude at all and remained professional. She deserves a raise! Would recommend to people trying to have a fun Sunday brunch with a bunch of friends! Thanks for a fun time guys! Hope the waitress didn't get in trouble it wasn't her fault!",

Bc it's not quite in the heart of downtown and on weekends it's dead bc the main part of this area is school or work. SX is a much needed addition. The decor is interesting. Huge over sized chairs and a lot of attention was paid to the smallest details. Not a fan of the wall champagne art, it's tacky and so not done well. Perfect spot to pregame before an event. I'm sure with any event in Grant Park, e.g., the Taste of Chicago, concerts, etc., this place will be packed. SX specializes in craft cocktails and a merriad of small plate options such as sushi, chicken, etc. I suggest the Elotes Dip along with a classic Martini.",

If you try to split the bill, they will over charge your card & print out receipts that had nothing to do with your order until it adds up to a price THEY think makes sense.  Let\u2019s start off with the positive...You can definitely get some great Instagram pictures in this place, but don\u2019t let the looks fool you. My friends and I (three of us total) had a reservation to go get drinks/appetizers from SX Sky Bar before another event. We received our food/drinks but had to return one plate because the chicken was not cooked all the way through. (It happens, so we weren\u2019t mad about it. The waitress Alexia nicely took it back to the chef and brought us a replacement fully cooked)  The real issue was our check... We explained to the waitress we wanted to split the bill three ways. (Cash & two cards) When she returned with our cards (over 20 minutes later) the original bill & the cash was no longer in the card holder and we were over charged on our cards. So we asked the waitress why this was and she said \u201cthat\u2019s just how our system is. It doesn\u2019t split the bill like you wanted.\u201d We were not okay with this because the receipts she brought back for us to sign weren\u2019t even items we had. The receipt mainly showed 1/8 Pepsi for multiple line items and one item we actually had until it added up to a certain price. So she said she will fix it with the manager. (Another 20minutes goes by) Then we asked for the manager. So the General Manager, (according to her card) ERICA came out saying the same thing the waitress said \u201cthat\u2019s just how our system is.\u201d Not once were they apologetic for these fraudulent receipts they were trying to have us sign. They had more of a \u201cit is what it is\u201d attitude towards us shrugging their shoulders. We asked multiple times for the original receipt they brought us before we gave our cards/cash, they finally admitted that they THREW IT AWAY. They said they couldn\u2019t reprint it from their system because (again) \u201cit doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d She swiped our cards again with the lower price and said that when they close the system out, our bank statement will just show the one charge for the \u201ccorrect\u201d amount.  I will be watching for this correction to happen and give it a couple of days... But as of right now, the charge is still incorrect.  Let me be CLEAR! We still OVERtipped the waitress. This doesn\u2019t have as much to do with the money as it does the principle of them being fraudulent, unapologetic, & never taking blame for THEIR mess up. If they were clear from the beginning with us when we asked to split the bill, there wouldn\u2019t be an issue. The manager should have come out to speak with us right away instead of the 40minute wait between these transactions she claimed she was trying to \u201cfix\u201d  I get SX Skybar recently opened a couple of months ago, but I don\u2019t understand how fast food restaurants can split the bill and give you the proper receipt but this \u2018fancy\u2019 place can\u2019t....\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28",

The view is awful (trees) and even if you wanted to see out of the windows the view is blocked and you have to pay $2000 minimum bottle service for the privilege. The liquor and wine selection is very poor and overpriced.  I give this place 6 months before it converts itself into a nice bar rather than a poor man\u2019s club.
