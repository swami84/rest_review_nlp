The food is always excellent, and the wait has been minimal. 10-15min at most once the order has been placed.  Fair warning however, now that spring is here and Covid restrictions are apparently gone. We went this weekend to get a take-out order. It was a beautiful day and the Downtown Alpharetta area was busy. There were four parties ahead of me in line, the wait wasn't terrible to place my order - 15-min maybe. I then waited nearly an hour to get my food! And items were missing to boot, which we didn't realize until we had already arrived home.  The staff was very nice, and they credited me for the missing items. BUT, waiting an hour was ridiculous. They need to get more kitchen help or communicate the wait time.",

Crazy! In addition, the lady taking our order seemed very unhappy and got my son\u2019s order incorrect. I heard him order and he did speak clearly but like I said, the lady taking our order seemed very unhappy about taking our order so probably wasn\u2019t listening very well. In addition, I was literally being attacked by flies! The flies weren\u2019t just trying to get to my food, they were actually landing on me! So, that was annoying too! Nobody checking on people at the tables to see if they need anything. With lots of other restaurants nearby and during a pandemic, Chiringa really needs to step it up and offer better service and more for their customer\u2019s money!",

The menu looked good, but the wait time for food was over 30 mins after ordering on a weekday afternoon, and then the fries were soggy and tasted like old fryer oil, like it needed to be changed. My power bowl would have been great, but the rice was under cooked and crunchy to where it hurt my teeth. I didn't complain becuase I knew it would take forever to resolve. The worst was that we ordered the plantains and guac which looked amazing, but my son said he started feeling bad after eating it, (didn't tell me until we got in the car) and by the time we were almost home, 25 mins drive we both had to race to the bathroom from bad stomach cramps and super upset stomach. I think we got some sort of food poisoning and the plantains and guac were the only thing we both ate. It was awful, we felt terrible for the rest of the day and a day after.",

If you don't look outside it feels like one of those beach shack restaurants in Clearwater, Florida.  Food: this was the best part of the restaurant. I heard this was owned by the same people who did Tin Lizzy's so I was skeptical of the food quality but they knocked it out of the park. I had a fish sandwich costing $16 that was comparable to a $30 fish entree you would purchase at a nice sit down restaurant. My wife had one of there bowls costing $11 and she felt it was remarkable. The food is very healthy, tastes great, and was cooked to perfection.  Drinks: they have your typical beers and wines in addition to frozen Rose and margaritas. The drinks we're tasty but cocktails were a bit overpriced in my honest opinion. $4 beer. $11 margarita.  Seating: this place is kinda small with typical high top and booth tables inside. There are only about 10 or less indoors. The outdoor seating is great though. They have about 4 picnic tables with adjustable umbrellas for shade. They also have some Adirondack chairs perched under some beautiful trees.  Parking: none specific to the restaurant but Alpharetta downtown has ample parking within a few blocks of the town square. For now at least.",

Menu for lunch is pretty limited but enough variety where everyone in your group should be able to find something they like. I had the fish sandwich which was very good however I'm still suffering from sticker shock. They do it via market price. Today was fresh snapper. Awesome in theory but $17 for a small piece of fish.. ouch. $21 for lunch after tax and tip with water to drink. I would have to suggest they find a piece of fish for a normal price fish sandwich and then also offer an upgraded fresh option. Just my two cents. Loved the place other than that. Nice addition to Alpharetta.",

I think it is a bit pricey for walk-up counter service but the food and drinks were awesome and the service is great so it's still 5 stars from me.
