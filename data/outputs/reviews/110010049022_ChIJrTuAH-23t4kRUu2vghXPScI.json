However due to the fact that they take their Covid precautions to the extreme, will not come back. I could not enjoy my dinner, because every time I was in the middle of enjoying a dish, a waiter would come around to bring something to the table and ask you to mask up. This is a pre-course dinner so they keep bringing dishes, and drinks so imagine having to put n a take off your mask at least 20 times during your dinner.  There are plenty of other restaurants in DC that allow you to safely have dinner during Covid without going over the top. This is not one of them. Also, even though they are so cautious about Covid, one of the waiters kept touching his mask ( I assume the N-95 mask was not fitted correctly on him, hence he had to constantly fiddle with it)  which defeats the purpose of wearing one if you constantly touch it, and the pour water or bring out my food after touching your mask.",

You go to these places for the full experience and unfortunately this place failed to deliver on that front. They took covid awareness to a different level. Just to note we are very conciousness  of this ourselves and take every precaution. Every time a server came around you had to mask up. In fact we were told at seating that while we are not drinking or eating we should mask up while sitting at the table.  You literally  have to keep.your mask on one hand all night. After a while it really got out of hand when you are on a  5 meal course. They said that was DC rules which I think was exaggerated.  In the past weeks we had visited  Bresca, Nobu and  Blue Duck  and we didn't experience the same policy.  They should advertise their policy and let people know ahead of time of this when making reservations. It may seem like a small thing. But trust me  when I say it was honestly annoying. Make sure to take a disposable mask otherwise you'll smell your dinner for a long time as many times we masked up. I don't think we ll go back again, perhaps when covid is all done with we'll give it another try .",

In a post- COVID world, this restaurant will continue to put patrons and their staff first which is a great quality!  The food was phenomenal and was honestly better than anticipated! The ambiance was so cute and fun and made the night feel really special. I can\u2019t wait to go back again!!!!",

The instructions for reheating were easy to follow, and the presentation was visually stunning, even replated. Also, order the Dabnog. For goddess\u2019 sake, order the dabnog.

There are two bonus items you get on top of the menu (bread at the beginning and bon bons after dessert) plus my malted chocolate ice cream dessert was literally as big as a softball.

Ended up getting all the snacks (they're all included), the butternut squash on the fire as an appetizer, the chicken and dumplings (their unique take with TONS of fall root vegetables), and the apple crumble for dessert. And it was my birthday, so they put a candle on my dessert and brought us complimentary prosecco to celebrate with. Truly one of the best meals I've had in the last decade or so. The ambiance is wonderful, too. Would give more than 5 stars if that was possible.",

(When you are pregnant, you cannot control when you really need to use the restroom.) We asked if we could use the restroom as a paying customer and we were told no. I understand this is all because of COVID but I cannot support a business that doesn't want support their patrons. Also, it's not like they are doing  takeout only, they take reservations and offer outdoor dining services. I hope they are not treating us differently because we are Asians.

We had an excellent meal at such a reasonable price for a Michelin starred restaurant. The snack, the starter, the entree, all excellent. The sweet potato roll with catfish was like a Chic-fil-A sandwich on a Sunday, a rare treat only to be had due to tragedy. The chicken, was finger licking good, and the dessert was like a nice fancy brownie cake. -----  It was 5-6 stars up until the entree. Unfortunately, like many places the apps way outshine the entrees the way Beyonce outshines the rest of Destiny's Child. If we had just stopped at the apps we would still be on a cloud. We ordered the Sweet Potato Roll with Pork Belly, the Poached Farm Egg, the Buttermilk Biscuit, the swordfish and the grilled pork. I want to go back again just for the Buttermilk Biscuit, for it is divine, egg, foie gras, a thin sliver of ham and the maple.....heaven on a plate. The Poached Farm Egg, also excellent, creamy, with pork. Then after that, things went to the land of 'just okay'. The swordfish may as well have been tofu because it didn't seem to have a taste of its own and the other things on the plate just didn't seem to go with each other. The grilled pork was also just okay. The dessert, as others have mentioned, leave much to be desired. We had the blondie as it was the only thing that seemed to promise chocolate. It was okay sort of. Not bad, just more of a let down. The tiny pecan cookies that came with our bill were way better. Service was good. Atmosphere was charming, and after about 6:30 you must speak with a raised voice. We will return, the Buttermilk Biscuits are calling my name.",

The catfish is crispy, yet melts in your mouth with the right toppings, sauce and bun to create the ideal bite.  Service and ambiance are great. I sat at the bar and the service was attentive and friendly, without rushing. I love the decor, with the fireplace, open oven, brick and plants.  I had a \"smoky\" tequila cocktail that didn't taste smoky and wasn't worth $14. It left me craving mescal from a nearby spot.  The chicken and dumplings left me feeling mixed. The broth has a great depth of flavor and the chicken is tasty (some pieces are a bit big for a bite). I also liked the dumplings, but you have to go on a treasure hunt to find them at the bottom of the pot. The big miss is the addition of raw winter vegetables. I love carrots in soup, but these were too crunchy (no texture benefit) and served as a distraction, not an addition. Cook the carrots longer, add more dumplings, and this dish is a home run.",

My wife said, \"if you're not putting any extra sauce on them, they must be good\" and they are indeed. Besides the sliders, we purposely tried to have different items than we did the 1st time. I got pics of everything we had this time to make it easier for our next visit lol. Our waitress recommended ordering 4-6 items and our consensus is that's too much for us. The sliders themselves are a pretty solid start, but if you take the table bread (which is also delicious) and drinks, we personally think it's too much seeing that you want to get dessert in too ;-) The star of the night: braised short rib. Fork tender and so delicious and pairs perfectly with the creamed potatoes. Initially I was disappointed not to see the Butterscotch pie on the menu, but not for long as the Apple crumble may have taken the dessert crown. Good food, energetic setting, & great service. Look forward to our next visit.  1st review: Dabney was sooooo good! We will definitely be going back to this place. It's a nice place, great wait staff, good drinks, and really good food. We tried a lot of things and they were all good. Also, the Butterscotch pie is a great dinner ender. Can't wait to go back...but get your reservations in.",

My brother and I reserved a table and there wasn\u2019t one thing we didn\u2019t enjoy. The firewood, the ambiance, the servers were fantastic (we had Hannah I believe, thank you) and even the restrooms were all so beautiful. I enjoyed the decor and noted how the time for the food to come out was surprisingly quick. Wine selection is also very nice and the food is diverse, yet sticks to what the restaurant is. 10/10 will come back",

The space is beautifully put together, rather cozy and intimate. It elevated our dinning experience before we sat.  At the bar we were greeted by Megan behind the counter. She was most courteous and thorough presenting the menu to us. She'd continue to assist us through our meal with a level of warmth and attentiveness that made us feel at home.  We had the radishes, oysters, NY strip and swordfish. Each dish was meticulously put together with color and flavor to delight the palate. The food was, simply put, excellent.  I look forward to my next trip to the DC area just to experience this little gem one more time.",

The only dish we didn\u2019t like was the steak one, neither the cut or technique made it tender... it was too stringy and the veggies were too hard. My favorite dishes were the sweet potato rolls, the fluke and the baked Virginia.",

Our server shared with us details on the menu, specials, and her personal favorites. She didn\u2019t rush us but as first timers there we also didn\u2019t feel like we were left hanging stranded on an island.  All of the playing was beautiful and we went with about half of her recommendations, and half of what we thought sounded good. There wasn\u2019t one dish that we didn\u2019t like.  Let me go back to my exceeded expectations comment.. we had a tough time deciding on dessert.. much to my surprise they gifted us one of the two desired options AND brought us a glass of champagne to cap it all off.  I\u2019ve been to several Michelin stared restaurants in the area, and this one truly made me feel special and made the dining experience unique, warm, and welcoming. I\u2019d definitely go back!

Just be aware that the plates are small and they encourage you to share, which doesn\u2019t make much sense to me except that the prices are pretty high ($10-25 per small plate) so you probably won\u2019t try many dishes unless you share.

Fair warning... the cuisine is served as small plates that offer diners tastes of a variety of dishes so if you\u2019re expecting a traditional menu of one-serving meals, this is not for you. But if you like variety with unique ingredients combined in creative ways, you\u2019ll love the choices that are updated daily. The staff is knowledgeable and can offer recommendations based on your tastes. Expensive since about 4 plates is close to a full meal, but try it if you\u2019re looking for something different.",

A unique concept that adds to the experience and is great for photos or a quick stroll to explore. The Dabney specializes in small plates and unique dishes with interesting combinations. However, somehow it all works together and becomes a perfect marriage of flavors in your mouth. You wont go wrong with the catfish sliders, which are absolutely delicious a must try that leave you wanting more. The broccoli crab, flank steak and potato salad. Each dish is presented with a nice little introduction that gets you excited about getting ready to taste your meal. Sarah took great care of us. She was attentive and answered all of our questions with great details. The decor is modern and there is a vibrant yet private feel and exclusive atmosphere. Although the restaurant isn't overly spacious each table setting is exclusive enough in that you feel alone and unbothered by others around you although every table is full and in great conversation.. When finished head next door to the Columbia Room and enjoy the rooftop deck and a couple of very eclectic drinks that you just have to try in order to understand.  #fallynsfoodieexcursions #thedabney #smallplatescanstillbegreat #alleyrestaurants #thecolumbiaroom",

Decided to try a different wine and she was good enough just to give me a taste before I committed (which was great because I did NOT like my first choice). She then recommended another that was just right. Open kitchen, so you can see everyone working. Fancy cocktails with fresh herbs. You can eat both inside or outside. Only drawback was it was a little expensive (dinner for 1 person with 2 glasses of wine was $77)",

The bread was so good, soft warm and sweet, the catfish had a nice crunch, and the pickled and mayo flavors just made this a package of delicousness. SCALLOP CRUDO - This reminded me of a ceviche. The scallops were super fresh and the texture was just right. Yum! HEARTH ROASTED SPRING VEGETABLES - I was on the fence about getting this dish at first, but am happy we opted for this. It was nice to have some greens and vegs before the last two heavy dishes. SOFTSHELL CRAB - This dish was good.. but it wasn't my absolute favorite. I just might not be crazy about softshell crab in general. The fact that it was deep fried and had a layer of some type of mayo sauce on top made this dish too rich for me. It was nice and crunchy. The green sauce (I think pureed pea shoot) helped to balance the richness a bit. GRILLED BEAVER CREEK QUAIL - There were no beavers harmed in the making of this dish.. lol This is a quail dish. The quail filet was cooked to a medium setting - never had poultry cooked medium before, but it worked out well! It was so tender and tasty. The claws also made me lol. I held onto them to eat the teeny quail thighs which were soo flavorful. BENNE, MILK & HONEY - This dessert had a variety of textures and flavors. There was definitely a sweet and savory thing going on. Loved loved the candied honey comb! We wanted to go with a dessert that is really different, and this fit the bill.",

Some of the food was really good, in particular, the big streak thing (T Bone if I'm not mistaken) was really top notch. The bread was also very good  I didn't like: 1. Most of the food wasn't actually that great. Nothing was bad, but 7/10 level 2. The disserts really sucked. We ordered all of them so I tried all and all were quite bad. Most of them salty which wasn't to my liking 3. No real coffee (just the weird American thing they sometimes wrongly refer to as coffees)  Overall great experience but I am not sure I would come here for the food, it's the whole experience that is great.",

The Dabney is one of those spots that is so frequently raved about but so difficult to get into that I had never been.  From the time I entered the restaurant, I was immediately welcomed by warm service. The hostesses were very helpful and seated me right away.  The meal starts with the most wonderful bread and sorghum molasses butter. My friend and I could have probably eaten a whole loaf of this bread with the butter. SO good.  The fried oyster sliders were incredible, probably my favorite part of the meal. The sweet potato bun and the crunch of the oyster worked perfectly together.  We also ordered the scallop crudo which was just okay, honestly. I was kind of disappointed that our waitress had recommended this dish because it was a little bland. Not terrible but not mindblowingly good like the fried oyster sliders were.  For the entrees we ordered the quail and the chicken. The chicken left a little to be desired, honestly. The quail, however, was fantastic. The rice underneath the quail was actually quite good and I don't even really like rice!  Drinks were solid. I ordered a cocktail that had celery in it so the taste was pretty unique and on trend with the celery craze taking over America.  We didn't get to dessert so I'll save that for an updated review. I definitely want to come back!",

The food was delectable, the drinks heavenly and the service encyclopaedic; the epitome of charm and diligence. Abby, at reception, squeezed us in and was cheerful and friendly. Ben who served us was a walking bible of good food and drink.  The crew at the Dabney should be proud of what they've created. The ambience is relaxing and warming (both times we've nearly been the last to leave). The cooking is simultaneously back to basics and cutting edge. Take a look at the wood-burning hearth in the open kitchen and watch the nonchalantly accomplished chefs moving the skillets and pans around in the flames and heat. The food is a perfect mix of tiptop ingredients, served in beautiful, colourful dishes woven together with imagination and creativity. This without being over-engineered and instead hearty and delicious. The team run the restaurant like clockwork but with the customers not the numbers first.  I think this might be DC's best restaurant and I don't say that lightly. Go there if and when you can, I'm not the first to realise this place is an absolute gem...",

We went with 6 people, and with two nice bottles of wine and cocktails, our tab came to about 800, so unless you're rich, don't expect to go too often.  We got one of about everything on the menu, and while the meat dishes were cooked and flavored to perfection, the vegetables were insane - I didn't think carrots could that good, and I imagine brassicas must be pretty hard to cook since I have never seen them on the menu anywhere else.  Best dishes out of the 10 we tried: Catfish sliders on their homemade buns, grilled carrots, fried Chesapeake Sugar Toads, and charred greens.  Well done, Dabney!",

All of the dishes are adaptations of Eastern shore standards and comfort food taken to a haute level with the freshest ingredients, the best preparation techniques, and the most well thought out plating and sauce/spice complements. The plates are small so if you are a group of 3 expect everyone to get one bite from a plate. Definitely order the off menu catfsh sliders. The beef spare rib (family style) is perfect for 4 people who are also getting 4 or 5 other plates or just 2 people who are doing maybe 1 or 2 other plates. Eastern shore dumplings were another highlight. Good cocktails round out the experience. Service was on point for a one star and if they up their plating game, work on combining more textures into each dish, and add a few waitstaff to each table then they will get a second star in the near future.",

The flavor and delicate texture are almost indescribable in their perfection. The pacing of the dishes was excellent, and the waitstaff were extremely attentive and solicitous. Of course, the food was the main event, but I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn't find a single thing to critique about this place. Bathrooms? Spotless. Music? Tasteful and not too loud. Lighting? Romantic but not too dark. Decor? Impecable (and seasonal). Temperature? Ideal (I'm usually too cold at restaurants, but I was actually able to send my coat to coat check here and I didn't miss it one bit!)",

The restaurant is tucked away in a cobblestoned side street and you wouldn\u2019t know it was there if you weren\u2019t looking for it. The interior is beautiful. What\u2019s special about the Dabney is that they use a big wood fire so that the food has a certain smokey quality that cannot be produced in the home kitchen. My parents said the food was terrific!

The bar also serves up some classic and original delights. The waitstaff are sweetly enthusiastic, warm, and welcoming without being overbearing or energy-draining. The atmosphere is cosy, but not too dim. The open fire which the kitchen uses to cook many dishes sets off the room beautifully. The open kitchen is a delight to watch, as everyone plays their role with precision and grace. Notably, the kitchen feels relaxed and collegial; no manufactured display of high tension, only a practiced confidence and a deep respect for the food. They share love, here. Reservations are recommended, but you could sneak in to the bar by yourself or one companion without too much fuss most weeknights.",

We had to wait for about an hour (theres bars next door), but we were given a table instead of a place at the bar, which was nice. The food was lovely, we liked everything we tried, but the brassicas and the sweet potato bread pudding were phenomenal. We felt that the sugar toads could have been more flavorful, it was not a bad dish, but it just didn\u2019t stand up to how impressive everything else was.

St. Malachi Cheese: A charred cracker with cheese, honey, and fruit. Overall it was a good combination, but nothing that blew me away. The char on the cracker was the main taste that came forward.  2. Crispy Pig Ear Lettuce Wraps: The pig ears taste like perfectly crispy bacon, and the wraps bring a very delicious combination of savory from the pig ear and freshness from the lettuce and vinaigrette.  3. Maryland Blue Crab: Absolutely amazing, the crab with the texture and tartness of the walnuts and apples is divine. I could eat 5 orders of this.  4. Winter Squash: One of the most delicious vegetable dishes I've ever eaten. The greens complement the nice hearty flavor of the squash.  5. Charred Carrots: The carrots are always sweet, savory, and tasty. The only problem with these is sometimes the cuts are a little uneven so the center of the bigger pieces are slightly undercooked.  6. Grilled Scallops: If you love scallops, you will love these. Cooked with a chewy center and crisp on the outside.  7. Winter Radishes & Fried Oysters: Definitely one of the best looking dishes I ordered. The crispy oysters work perfectly with the tart radishes. However, you do end up with 80% radishes, which can be a little too tart on their own.  8. Foie Gras Biscuit: The foie gras had a creamy texture, and has a very strong savory flavor which pairs nicely with the sweet sauce on the biscuit.  9. Chesapeake Rockfish: I would definitely be sure to get this dish. Every element on this dish works perfectly together, from the two different sauces to the winter spice crumble. One of the more complicated dishes they make, and every part is worth the effort.  10. Spicy Lobster and Grits: Awesome buttery lobster, and a side of creamy grits. I can't ask for more.  11. Autumn Olive Farms Pork: The unassuming black pepper mash they put next to the pork can surprise you with the level of spice concentrated in it. Everything on the dish nicely complements the juicy and tender pork.  12. Bourbon Brown Sugar Sundae: The alcohol used in this dessert is not overpowering, and the sweetness of this dessert is nicely accented with the marshmallows and candied ginger.",

The Bar seating is first come first serve but I recommend making a reservation (we had to make ours two weeks in advance-yes they fill up that quickly). Our server Jessie was amazing along with the whole staff. Our waters were always filled and she was very attentive and the cocktails were made very well and in a way that you could actually taste the flavors of the liquor and herbs and not just a sugary concoction. I recommend to ask your server for recommendations on drinks if you're not sure on what to try. It's a short walk from the yellow/green line and walking distance to Chinatown Gallery Place. Would recommend to anyone to come and enjoy an evening.",

Everyone that we interacted with demonstrated that they really cared about our experience.  Their team really is fantastic.  The snacks, small plates and the family style choices are perfect for sharing and provide a community feeling.  We ordered 3 snacks,  a few small plates, the main, and all of the sides.  There wasn't a single misstep in presentation or taste. Everything seemed to belong together.  Pacing was great, never rushed or left waiting. Flavors were absolutely amazing. Cocktails were outstanding. There was some serious skill on display from the mixologist.  Very nice wine list as well.  We finished with 2 great desserts and 2 fine ports.  There aren't enough adjectives to describe the experience.  Simply put, one of the finest dining experiences I've ever had.  If you have the chance to go, do not pass it up.  Go hungry, and try everything. You will not be disappointed.  If anyone from the team at The Dabney reads this, thank you very much for a truly fantastic experience.",

The acoustics were great -- guests want to be able to hear each other at dinner and so many places don't get this right. The sound was good especially given we were near the open kitchen which added theater to our dining experience but didn't intrude. Very attentive service.  The rolls for the catfish sliders were whispering from across the room when I spied them on the slide in the kitchen area. They didn't disappoint. The food was beautifully styled and delicious. We almost ordered a second tuna Crudo. A simple pea  and mint spread was complex and served with warm grilled pita. The charred raddicchio don't sound that appetizing but it was one of the best dishes. I loved the look of the beet dish and the flavor, but the texture of the uncooked beets against the cooked beets didn't work for me  We had the lamb which was perfectly seasoned and roasted and had a simple but perfect tomato salad and a grain dish that I loved but can't recall the details of. We had at least half the dishes on the menu so my palate was happily overwhelmed.  The desserts didn't dazzle as much as the other dishes. They seemed a little stingy size wise but that gave us more room to eat second dessert at Butter cream.  This was probably the best meal I've eaten in DC... ever.",

Light on mint, bold flavor. Wine list was heavy on Italian and Spanish wines - not an issue, but I typically prefer something less thin, with filler body.  We got the short rib and acoutrement. Short ribs were good and crispy but over seasoned. The quinoa has too much soy, but I get how they were trying to match the short ribs in flavor. Tomato salad was basic but refreshing, especially when paired with such heavy, over seasoned dishes. We didn\u2019t get dessert (too full)  I\u2019d return, but be more thoughtful of our structute of the meal.",

The wines I selected were very good and included a nice mix.  The plates were good but did not really knock me off my feet but I will likely go again since my selection was limited.",

My hubby took me for an amazing experience.  The food was delicious with the unusual combinations you would never think of. They cook their food using an open wood-burning kitchen.  I watched as they added more wood, fan the fire, poke the wood to make the perfect amount of fire to cook with. The restaurant is a very pricey but worth it for the experience.  At the end of the meal, they brought us 2 glasses of bubbly compliments of the house and after dessert they brought us what they call 2nd dessert a pair of freshly baked gingersnaps.  The food and the staff were amazing.  Thank you Dabney for helping us celebrate my birthday in style!",

Dishes are larger than tapas but smaller than full-size entrees. The waitress's recommendation of 2-3 dishes per person was appropriate. Each dish was creative and attended to details. Dabney did not need to win attention from your palate with excessive oil or salt like many other  restaurants (e.g. Tail Up Goat). The dishes were full of flavors, distinctive while harmonious. Dabney wasn't trying to be very fancy or theatrical like a lot of two or three stars places , but if the taste matters most to you, this is the place to go. Excellent selection of wines as well (not that they collect an expensive list , but they actually \"select\" good-value ones for you within the small menu). I can't wait to come back again.",

The outstanding  dessert was the highlight of the meal; I'd follow the pastry chef anywhere she goes.  Overall a disappointing experience for a place I've heard so much about, and which takes pride in sourcing unusual local ingredients; don't think I'll return. :-(",

As soon as you walk in you see the large fire that they've become known for over which they prepare almost everything that comes to your table. Even if you can't get one of the must have reservations, try your luck at getting a seat at the bar where you can order the full menu. Defer to your server as many of the menu items shift. The breads are all lovely, the sliders are large, and everything is best enjoyed shared with a friend or four. All of the service lives up to the hype (and price tag). Drinks are unique and fun - have an extra one here instead of going to the much talked about neighbor, Columbia Room. These are a better value in a far better space.",

The setting with the open kitchen and the huge fireplace is beautiful and the wine selection is perfect. But the best part was the food!! Scallops and leeks in an amazing sauce. Wonderful vegetables, fresh, tasty and served with the perfect match if herbs and spices. And there was the quail... I don't remember what were the spices, but I do remember this was the best quail I ever had. Tender, juicy and so tasty I didn't want it to end. Will definitely be back next time in in D. C.

Perhaps it\u2019s Michelin arrogance, but the standard and service have dropped markedly. The menu on the day was uneventful and the portions have been sized down. Suddenly you find yourself spending over $100 per person for a number of shared plates with an unsatisfied appetite. The Dabney is the type of restaurant that will now charge you $15 for lettuce, and market fois gras and toast as modern cuisine, while offering three items on a plate for two people (really?).  I took a friend from out of town to The Dabney to impress her - we left unimpressed.  REVIEW OCT 2016:  Love, love, love this place. Hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to in DC thus far. A total experience: excellent service, excellent ambiance, excellent setting. The food was exquisite, small plates but absolutely delicious. That they're small plates encourages you to order a few plates, thus getting a wide taste of the menu. Well deserved of the Michelin rating.",

Mixing and matching between the small plates and large plates gives you the best bang for your buck. The roast duck, smoked squash and foie grois biscuit were some of the highlights! Hopefully they'll still be on the menu when I go back.",

My girlfriend and I tried five dishes and a dessert, and two of the dishes were perfect, while the others were *better* than I could have imagined. We can't wait to go back. A reservation is highly recommended, and should be made well in advance.",
