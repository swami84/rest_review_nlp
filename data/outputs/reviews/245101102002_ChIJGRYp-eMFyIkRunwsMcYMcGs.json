Went on a friday night around 9:45pm.Immediately the music selection was good, every song a good song , R&B, new soul and slow jams. There was a wait about 20-25 minutes. Many people were entering and exiting but the wait to be seated was a while. I want to say we sat down around 10:20ish. Before that the live band started playing and singing. We got seated and a waitress came over introduced herself and took out orders. The menu has a lot of option and they portions are big. I ordered the jerk soft tacos and honey Brussel sprouts. They were out of the Brussel sprouts she  suggested the cauliflower bites - honey lemon pepper with buffalo sauce on the side. The  tacos were great, a lot of meat and a good portion. The bites came out hot and crispy. I ordered the Pink champagne which was thee best and 1 tequila shot. Overall the the customer  service was good. the waitress kept coming to check on us,  the atmosphere was a vibe and the open mic when different people started singing was a vibe. I would definitely return to this place but I would arrive a little earlier.",

I ordered crabby fries and was also going to order the chicken and waffles, but when I saw the crabby fries I changed my mind. My cousin ordered hot wings, they were really good. However my crabby fries were phoney, it was crab dip plastered on top of some fries. I was expecting the ooey-gooeeyness of melted cheese and lump crab meat on the fries, not crab dip. If you like crab dip then you might like these. It looks like tuna salad. My palette was a little upset lol, so I didn't finish it. My cousin and her friend ate them.  The service was kinda slow it looked like there were only 3 waitresses. Our waitress was cool.  I would return to try something different and hopefully the service is faster.  It is black  owned.",

First off, the atmosphere was lively however I waited over 2 hours for appetizers and my entree. Both were cold and did not taste good at all. After waiting hours for my food and it being nasty and cold I asked for a refund the manager said I could not get one after knowing my food took hours. She offered to make something else, which took another 45 mins. I got there 8:30. I left around 11 (closing) bc the service was so long. I spend $125 all together and I only consumed 2 drinks and a little bit of my appetizer. Total waste of money, they are extremely busy and need better chefs. I would not have minded waiting if the food was good but everything was cold and had no flavor. I would not come back or recommend anyone to come here.",

There was no real dimension to the \u201ccocktails\u201d we were served either. Almost like they just threw some stuff in a cup and put it on the table to drink.

I also had the 3 piece wings with mac n cheese as my side. The Hennessy bbq flavor wasn't the best, but the chicken was tasty and fried perfectly. The mac N cheese was a little on the watery side and needed more flavor. My friend loved his lamb chops and my other friend didn't like the jerk chicken tacos. The service from our waitress was superb, BUT the service time took forever. It took a while for our food and drinks to come out. I plan on going back. Gratuity is added to every bill.

I believe this to be the building where I used to attend Louis ' Book Store many years ago and I think the glass doors are the ones from that earlier establishment. The fore part of Civil is somewhat gloomy and needs more lighting but we ate at the rear of the dining room and near the well lit bar. Civil is decorated in nouvoux something and reminiscent of the late 1930', with dark, padded two person dining tables: there's a posh wall covering of trompe d'oel effect faking padded and buttoned silk material. We passed up the buffet. My wife ordered a turkey club sandwich with 'fries and I opted for the Cajun Fettuccine Alfredo. The food arrived after a suitable period for cooking and it was fresh and hot. The server was adequately prepared to handle about ten folks who were dining at the time. My fettuccine was richly sauced , the pasta perfectly cooked, the peppers delicately sliced and the smoked sausage went down well with the Cajun named dish. The serving size was gargantuan, and I foolishly attempted to eat the whole serving instead of dividing out a take home portion: I swallowed a month's worth of cholesterol as a result. Our coffees were strong, piping hot and a far cry from the tepid offerings currently in vogue with our litigiously threatened catering industry. A good meal. This place may not have dessert spoons - or else they were all in the dish washing machine. There are several puddings on the menu and I do like to dive into a pudding wielding a dessert spoon, rather than the oversized teaspoons that seem common nowadays We exchanged a few words with a neighboring couple who praised their choices from the buffet meal and noting its freshness and adequate temperatures. It was their first time at Civil and they indicated they would be back. I will place Civil as the lunch place to visit each time we make our weekend trips to the Walters '. This will be a",

Beautiful ambiance, I guess people can come really casual or really dressed up, although I did feel overdressed wearing heels while some guests had sweats on. I liked the food although it did take kinda long on a random Thursday evening, my friend ordered an appetizer as her main course (crab balls) and her order took the longest; it came by the time everyone else finished their entrees. The entrees were so incredibly small for the price though I was actually really surprised i paid close to 40 dollars for a cut of salmon (with a side salad that never came, but I don\u2019t like salad anyway hehe) and crab mac and cheese sparse in crab and served in an appetizer style cup. Peach sangria was delicious. Definitely a spot to go to if you\u2019re looking for a bar, and might like a snack later.  UPDATE: I went out with a friend for a date, he wanted to surprise me with a \u201cnew\u201d place he\u2019d heard of, aka the Civil. Once I saw where we were I gave him the run down of what I thought of this place. Nonetheless, we went in to basically a club scene, very loud live DJ, a huge crowd, people just standing, people sitting at tables that clearly had not been serviced. We understood the crowd because it was fight night, so we went upstairs and were greeted by women twerking all over the place lol... There was one waitress in the area, the food on the menu had definitely been updated and there were way more options than my first visit. About an hour went by and I waved the waitress down to ask if she would be okay with taking our order. She nicely told us that we had to order at the bar and they would bring our food up. It took my date about 20 minutes to get us drinks from the bar... We couldn\u2019t even imagine how long it would take for us to order and RECEIVE our food. We left with nothing in our bellies. Also MANAGEMENT: please make sure guests are not sitting their drinks on the stairs! Huge safety hazard. Either be more strict or put out more tables.",

The crabs balls were terrible, hard and dried out. Had to be reheated before. I would zero stars if I could. The manager came over and made an excuse that this was all due to a change in shifts. I will never return to establishment. Needs to shut down. They need chick fil a training. Horrible Horrible Horrible",

Her biscuit was very under cooked and was basically dough. My Belgian Waffle was paper thin and tasted very plain. (Not how a real Belgian waffle should be)  The waitress noticed my girlfriends plate was still full when we asked for the check and asked what was wrong, but there was no offer to re make or discount the meal. When we got the check we noticed that our juices were $4.00 a Peice and they added a mandatory 15% gratitude bringing our bill to $36!  Now I normally tip without an issue and would have done so because the waitress was very friendly. But I was shocked to see the price of their drinks and the quality of their food was definitely under par.",

The Belgian waffles are not in fact Belgian waffles, the bacon was plated without any intention or class. The waiter was great but my biggest complaint would be with the kitchen. Completely disorganized. Be prompt. This place has a lot to improve upon. The customer bathrooms are down stairs (inconvenient) but they have a staff bathroom in a very convenient space. Who does that? Will seriously think twice before coming here again.",

The server needs a lot more training--the number of times she said \"not a problem\" or \"I'll make it work\" when we asked for things like coffee and maple syrup (which never came) was shocking. A server really shouldn't use those phrases. She also came to double check what we ordered 3 different times over 25 minutes. Our food should have come out by the third time she stopped by. When our food did arrive, it was underwhelming. The waffle is like a thin Eggo, omelette didn't have toast or potatoes, shrimp grits had 4 pieces of shrimp in it, french toast extremely dry (no butter or syrup was plated with it). Mimosas were almost all orange juice and she didn't come by nearly enough for refills (the glasses were those tiny tasters you use for New Year's toasting). We really wanted to like this place because the inside is beautiful and I think the hate they got leading up to their opening about the $60 gold chicken wings was unfair. They really need to focus on training their staff and rounding out the rest of the menu beyond the buffet. You can't rely on a $30 brunch buffet and not have any coffee in stock when there's so many other brunch places in the neighborhood",
