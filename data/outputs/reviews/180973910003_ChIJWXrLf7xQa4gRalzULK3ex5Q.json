We were told when we made the reservations we would be placed at tables near each other.  That didn't happen.  They moved half our party to the opposite end of the restaurant, even though there was an open table next to our loved ones.  Front Manager completely disregarded us and didn't even attempt to make it right.  It made it even worse to see him fawning over a table of 4 well dressed  patrons,  even though we were clearly spending more money. None of us will be back and I enrourage you to go elsewhere.",

        "caption": "Where do I begin? My sister in law made reservations for NYE (which was her birthday). Because of Covid we had 2 different reservations in order to accommodate our party. One was for a party of 6 which was at 5pm and the other for a party of 2 that they made for 4:30. 3 of us arrived at 4:15 so that we could secure our 4:30 reservation.  Upon arrival we explained to them that we had 2 different reservations but wanted to make sure to get there in time for the first one. We were taken back to be seated and was seated at the table for 6 which was the 5pm reservation.  We asked if we could be seated at the table that reserved for 4:30 so that we didn't lose it. After a little back and forth, we were moved to the table that was reserved for 4:30 and told that when the rest of our party arrived at 5, we could adjust and move accordingly.  5pm comes the rest of our party arrives so they sat at the table that was reserved for 5pm.  No big deal right? Wrong! Manager Sean O'Connell comes up to the table and tells them that they can't sit there because they can't just seat themselves.  That would not have been a problem had we not been told by the lady who originally sat us that when our party arrived we could move back to the 5pm table accordingly.  We tried to explain that very calmly to Sean who was not nice at all. The birthday girl asked several times, what did we do wrong? I just want to enjoy my birthday. He just kept saying you need to come up front with me NOW. We all followed him up front still asking, what did we do wrong? We were told we could move to our \"previously, already sat at table\" when the rest of our party arrived.  Once we got up front, we were asked to leave because we were \"causing a scene\". Never once did any of us raise our voice,  say anything rude or use any bad language so we are again confused as to what happened. I feel like Sean wanted us to \"cause a scene\" so that he would feel like he was in the right to ask us to leave. We \"being adults who did absolutely nothing wrong as far as we're concerned\", asked for his name and left. Unfortunately this completely ruined my sister in laws 55th birthday celebration.  There was a total of 8 of us who had planned on spending good money for dinner. I would say close to if not more than $1000 plus tip. Ruth Chris downtown has lost my business. I usually go for my Birthday often with friends because it falls during Devour.  Not this year. I would tell any and everyone that I know to stay far away from there as possible.  The sad thing is, with all that's going on with downtown and them losing business, you would think they would be a little nicer to their customers and welcome us with open arms and smiling faces.  Not Sean O'Connell! \ud83d\ude14",

I phone the restaurant and inquire, I'm told, by Tammy, I have to come into the restaurant and place the order with the hostess to pay with the gift card We travel to Ruth's Chris, I go into place my order with Tammy. She asks if I need a menu, I tell her no, I have my order ready, as I was the one calling. I tell her I would like the Dinner for 2 special and she again as. I repeat my Dinner for 2 order and she says. You can only order that online.. i explained the gift card situation and she asks me again if I would like to see a menu. Seriously,  Tammy needs some customers skill training..  I called the Ruth's Chris in Keystone,  placed my order over the phone, paid when I arrived.

I also tried a friends BBQ shrimp very good. My filet was awesome  cooked perfectly all the was through. I also has the hashbrowns that was delicious and I took most of it home. I can't wait to reheat and eat. I tried my wife's lobster mac and cheese.  It was ok was missing something.  I wouldn't order again. My first drink was a aged rum boulevarder at first the bitters kind of overwhelming.  I stired and  drank the rest of it. It was not bad just not my drink.  My second drink was blood orange grapefruit margarita. I did like it but wouldn't order again. Overall was very pleased with our experience with the restuarant. I have been to a few expensive restaurants and wouldn't go back. I will go back to Ruth Chris again when I can save enough money to go back lol.",

My sever Mike was extremely helpful and suggested a mixed drink that was very delicious. He was attentive, but not overbearing. The food was hot and served to me what seemed like as soon as it was prepared. My date was late and when Sean, who I assume was the manager, saw me sitting alone he came and reassured me that if I needed absolutely anything that I shouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask. I was given a birthday card signed by everyone \ud83d\ude0d as well as a gift certificate and the most delicious piece of carrot cake I\u2019ve ever ate the next morning for breakfast lol.

The floor is the same. The walls have spots on them. The booths reminded me of a Denny's meets downtown old strip Vegas vibe. And they turn the lighting down so The worn out isn't as noticeable. Not so much ambience lighting. As for the food, the steaks were amazing. The rest of the food was average. Well, except for the ahi tuna app. That was delicious. The lobster bisque was lukewarm and average at best. The au gratin potatoes were undercooked, and the mashed potatoes were bland bland bland. The Filet Oscar, AMAZING! Absolutely delicious. My husband got the T-bone and it was really good also. They should've warned him that even after the plate was done sizzling that it could still potentially burn your tongue though. They also did this really cute thing at the end because it was our anniversary. And it was adorable and I loved it! I just cannot give it five stars because there were some Misses. I would say it's closer to a 3.5 due to the prices to expensive for everything that was under par. Don't mind paying if it's good. But there was also some great things. More like appetizers entr\u00e9es and desserts they do wonderful, sides not so much. Also we were told that there was a dress code, and I can assure you that there was not! People were coming in off the streets and we will not discuss or go into detail what they were wearing. But no one was stopping them or saying anything.",

Whoever picked up my call let me know that I could come in and order at the bar if I wanted to go. I did , when I approached the bar an employee I believe to be either a bartender or a manger walked towards me it seem as if he was about to help me . So I asked if I could place a to-go . He replied I\u2019m sorry but being that today is Valentine\u2019s Day we\u2019re not taking Togo orders . I tried to explain that they let me know that I could over the phone but he walked off right after telling me I couldn\u2019t place an order . I don\u2019t live downtown or close I wasted time and gas . Being that I work in the restaurant industry I\u2019m livid. But it\u2019s safe to say I won\u2019t be returning.

When we go to Ruth\u2019s we have always had impeccable friendly service, but not so much on Christmas at the downtown location.  Drinks (not water) remained empty for too long, we were in a crowded corner where the servers had to lean over me and my daughters main dish came out wrong and she had to sit for 15 minutes waiting for the correct dish while the rest of us ate our food.  This type of mistake is typically compensated or at least apologies are given- not on this visit.  Typically management will walk around and ensure the experience is great but it did not happen. For the money we spent on this dining experience I do feel it was a top notch experience or worth it. From now on I will only go to the 86th street location.",

The waiter told us that they were out of lobster mac and asparagus once we tried ordering. We ordered crab cakes and they came out and said they were out of that also.  My friend ordered a drink and did not get that until 10:30p. We were not offered out desserts until after we asked while they were bagging up our food. One person in our party ordered a well done steak. She was brought a steak that was pink in the inside. It was taken to the kitchen and brought back out by Eric. Eric stayed that the oven was off and they would not be able to cook it any longer. We tried explaining these things to the manager Justin. He did not apologize at all. He was very rude and stated that he does not understand how the service was bad. Wow. I have never been to Ruth Chris and received Popeye\u2019s treatment.",

The nice thing was they took the drinks off the bill and also covered our deserts plus gave me a 25$ off card on the next visit. This was my first time on my birthday a place that ive been wanting to go to for while. Honestly I wasn't impressed by the food but I was impressed by the overall service. I do plan to return.

Thankfully I've been to other Ruth Chris restaurants so I know this is not the norm, because otherwise there is NO way I would ever return to any of your restaurants. It took our waiter forever to come around to our table from the time we arrived, to checking on us after food, bringing drinks, offering another drink, for example we waiting 18 minutes to get a dessert menu after we asked him! Our water glasses were empty and we had to flag someone down to get more. I would expect this kind of service at a low end chain restaurant but for the amount of money we spent I expect much more. A manager never came by our table or I would have talked to them about it. He only had 1 other table in our room, so I don't know if they gave him tables on the other side of the restaurant or what he was doing. They should have been well staffed since it was Father's day and we had a reservation. I had to ask what the manager was handing to all the other dads in the restaurant since no one ever came over and they handed me the discount card for next time. Which I highly doubt we will use as I need some time to forget this terrible service and I'll be looking for another high end chain to celebrate events at.",

The restaurant is well appointed with a pleasant, welcoming decor. The lounge area with curving bar sits up front along with a row of dinner tables along the sidewalk facing windows. A melody of familiar and robust tunes emanated from the lounge piano musician throughout the evening.

It was tender and nice but we could barely taste the meat because it was drowned in butter.  The mushrooms were also floating in a bowl of butter marinated in salt.  The oysters were good though.  Overall it was very disappointing for the price.  I\u2019ve had much better food at Mcormick and Schmidt\u2019s.  Perhaps it was because this location is Indiana?",

Hubby and I opted to not go with the Thanksgiving dinner package, but the kids got it and it was delicious - turkey was juicy and flavorful. I've done more than my share of restaurant Thanksgiving dinners, and this was by far the best turkey meat I've ever tasted. Hubby got a ribeye which he loved, and I got the seafood tower which amazing. Soup, salad, dessert, bread - everything was top notch. Oh and they gave me the most generous pour of vodka on the rocks, which was GREATLY appreciated. Highly recommended!",
