My husband enjoyed a regular pizza and raved. My cousin ordered the calzone and said it was one of the best she has ever tasted. Atmosphere: excellent. The staff are friendly and seem to genuinely 1) be happy to see you and 2) want to make your visit so pleasant and perfect. If you are not hungry, stop in for house made tiramisu or espresso. Excellent.  Non ho MAI mangiato una pizza senza glutine cos\u00ec buona!!!! Complimenti allo chef / pizzaiolo Gino!!!",

We have only had pizza but i look forward to trying other items on their menu. They make their own cheeses and have a dairy farm. The quality of ingredients is very apparent. They have a beautiful wine list, great cocktails and the setting is very inviting. We love to sit on the patio, its fun being downtown but just set slightly off of Michigan ave. They are always friendly and remember us. Go visit this place, its amazing!",

Right across from the Ghirardelli, this place is a gemstone of a find! Started with the burrata sliders and had the calzone napoli for lunch.  Portion size for the calzone is excellent for two mildly hungry people or one starving individual lol I enjoyed every bite.  The sliders were memorable too; cold creamy burrata complemented with flavorful peppers made this the best thing I've had in a while.   Highly recommend pairing with an espresso macchiato for dessert <3",

I agreed that they have a OK selection of beers and wines for a cafe and the staffs are definitely friendly and attentive.  Service was very fast, the pizzas were done before the Carprese.  The ingredients are fresh for sure, and the pizza dough is indeed the best at least for me because it is chewy.  It is not easy to find Neapolitan style pizza (thin crust) that is not on the harder and dry side.  But personally I think the pizzas are missing some flavors, I felt like eating a pizza salad with no dressing but that might be good for some people.  By no means I am one of those pizza dough dip in ranch typecof guy, but I think the pizza sauce needs a little more depth.  Comparatively speaking my recent visit to Pizzeria Portofino was quite different.  I will have to find a reason to come back here.",

After we were done with our pizza, which was underwhelming, it took another 10 minutes for someone to notice that we were waiting for our check, then yet another staff member had to alert the owner that our server had not given us any attention or service.  The worst part was that the owner did not bother to apologize when giving us the bill, and even had us walk up to the cashier to pay for the bill. Not even a \"Thank you\" or a smile when we left.

The mozzarella and burrattas are as fantastic as advertised, with a special shout out to the pizzaiolos who are not only efficient but make a seriously good neapolitan pizza comparable to ones I've had in Italy. The espresso I had was also absolutely fantastic and the caffeine options alone are worth the trip for anyone who considers themselves an Italian coffee connoisseur.  The 4/5 stars comes from a couple areas in which service can be improved (not bussing tables efficiently, mix ups and delays on non-pizza orders) and a couple questionable design choices (the menus, while cutely attached to pizza rollers, are cumbersome; there is no signage indicating where the bathroom/deli/espresso bar is), but at least the former should hopefully be resolved over time.  Overall worth checking out and looking forward to coming by more!",

I am in hopes that management will read it and make the changes necessary for it to survive in this neighborhood. The decor and ambiance are first rate. They really did make a huge investment. I wanted a place where I could get a quick cappuccino, slice of fresh pizza, a pannini, gellato,cup of soup with good bread. I don't want to spend $28 for a quick bite. I wanted a place that I could make a part of my daily routine. Some people don't want to deal with a hostess or waiter. The quality of food is excellent I just believe the business plan may not work for neighborhood regulars like myself.",
