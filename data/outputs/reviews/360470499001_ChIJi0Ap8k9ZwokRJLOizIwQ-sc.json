Maintaining a consistent crispy texture and flavor, their  chicken are for those that want all of that goodness minus the oiliness that usually comes with fried chicken.  The sauces that accompany each order seem to be homemade in the kitchen. Each come with 4 different sauces. My favorite was the one labeled \u201cExtremely Spicy\u201d and is sure to push the right buttons for any spice enthusiast. If spicy isn\u2019t your thing, the other sauces are amazing as well and is certainly worth a try.  Although their fried chicken is to die for, I wouldn\u2019t leave out the rest of the menu either. Their fried chicken burger and fried rice cake skewers are great options as well if you\u2019re looking for other variety.  Peep\u2019s Kitchen is a MUST-GO for fried chicken enthusiasts, or anyone craving a quick fried chicken fix. I will certainly be coming back here soon, and they\u2019ve made a regular out of me!",
