Coffee au lait didn't have much of a coffee taste, just a lot of milk. Ice coffee was just bland. Nothing special.  Pancakes!! I saw three different types of pancakes - original, blueberry, and orange and walnut - and I chose the orange and walnut pancakes. It was $5 more than regular pancakes. Again, nothing special. Just pancakes with orange slices and very minimal amount of walnuts. The orange sauce was too tangy to go with the pancakes so I asked for maple syrup and butter.  My quest to find the perfect, fluffy, light pancakes would need to continue.  They forgot to serve us water.  There is a parking lot at the back of the building that is shared by 3 other stores. Very very limited parking. I street parked about 4 blocks away. Street parking are metered around this area, 4 quarters per hr except Sunday and holidays.",

And, to get extra coffee, she was so busy and I had wait for long time to grab her attention. I wish the waitress was more caring and attentive. Although it was a bit not pleasant encounter with the waitress, I really liked the restaurant, so I give 4 stars.",
