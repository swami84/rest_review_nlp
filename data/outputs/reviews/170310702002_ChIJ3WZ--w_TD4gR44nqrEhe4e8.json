From the moment my family and I walked in the door, it was nothing but welcoming smiles and comfort. The young woman behind the counter was kindly assisting others as she phone orders and completed orders in the kitchen. The bell continued to ring as she took orders, wrapped orders and restocked the drink machine cooler. How can a human move like this? I made a very large order priced over $100. The cook in the kitchen quickly and EFFICIENTLY prepared my order. She assured me on the ETA with each passing minutes. To have a staff as attentive, hard working, efficient, caring and comforting as her is absolutely amazing. These two are always working hard to ensure that the customers are happy and well fed. This young lady goes ABOVE AND BEYOND each and EVERY TIME!!!! Oh. And I can't forget about the chef with the magic hands! All-in-All, I love this place. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK TEAM!",

We went and came back at around 11:30 we ordered food for dine in and once we began eating she said we have to leave because they closed we asked if we could finish she rejected, she didn\u2019t even see what we had to say. She called the cops on us and turned off the lights, then once we got up she started cussing at us. Very disgusting customer service, I would not recommend to come here. I hope the owner fires her. If the owner sees this please reach out to me I will explain everything that happened.",

Car was there for 1 hour while I had lunch nearby. I understand parking is difficult as you said, but that doesn't mean you get special treatment to park your sedan and suv everyday. You are slowing traffic flow for your selfish benefit. I will continue to post pics to yelp, google, open table etc until rectified.  3rd update: See pic below.

        "caption": "I stopped in for the first time ever prior to a interview for a cooks position at Philly Bros last Friday, and purchased a sandwich and a drink. The sandwich was extremely oily and wet and almost impossible to hold, though tasty.  The bread was very unimpressive bland and flattened.  As a multi decade commercial sandwich maker, I knew given some time, I could easily improve on the sandwich I had just finished only half of.  After a few mins of our first meeting, new owner Bart was insistent on me handling food right away and seemed interested in suggestions to improve the bread and make other changes to help.  The cook he put me to train with I noticed immediately handled food with bare hands clearly dirty under and around the fingernails,  and was generally in a foul mood, and difficult for me to understand. By my third shift I was getting a handle on the entire menu, but we were very slow so I decided to use my time and do some extra cleaning i could clearly see was needed and being ignored.  What I found was quite disgusting in rotten and foul vegetables and meats behind counters where food was prepped, and dirty soiled crusty dishes essential to the making of the menu were being ignored. I cleaned old meats off of a stairwell and encountered several insects during all.  I probably should have realized me verbalizing these food safety complaints, would get me in trouble. The next day, after being scheduled for the entire first shift that week, and being promised a key to open up first shift by new owner Anna, I received a text from owner Bart, firing me for being \"unqualified\", a odd excuse because I had made 1000's of sandwiches at far busier places with mostly outstanding reviews over a couple decades.  Lastly, the frozen beef they use for most all beef dishes, may or may not comport with the Islamic only standards advertised in the store.  Weird to be the new guy and only one to insist on wearing plastic gloves handling food which seems like a easy adjustment to make in a Covid world, but talking about it, and insisting on some cleaning standards, got me fired pretty quickly.  I would not recommend this place to anyone with the current owners in charge, they seem unqualified on food prep as fresh foods were handled with dirty hands, and menu essential utensils/dishes were ignored and or poorly washed, while expired or rotten foods languished behind prep counters ignored.",

My daughter Felicia works in service where they take Doordash and Grubhub deliverys and she fixes them all of the time. Adam pretended to take down my name and said he would \"hook me up\" next time.

The food selection and variety is lovely, weather its the Philly cheese steak or Deep Fried Oreos. From what I had, everything tasted delicious & clean.  Overall was a great experience and the owner Sam made me feel right at home (Shannon was a great server as well).  Highly recommend trying this place out not just because its Halal, but because it tastes good.",

My personal favorite is the Italian Beef Philly, and yes it tastes delicious. Another favorite is the Brotato, I like mine with mild sauce sprinkled with Parmesan. For dessert you HAVE TO try the Oreo Sundae, it is amazing and Philly Bros is very well known for it! I think it is a great place to experience and the food is definetly different!",
