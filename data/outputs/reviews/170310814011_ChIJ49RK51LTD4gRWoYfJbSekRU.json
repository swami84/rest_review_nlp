Better in everything from tastiness, service and atmosphere. and for $16 my wife and I were able to get (2) six inch sandwiches, 2 sodas and a bag of chips including tax, Just what the doctor order when traveling on a budget. The bread was oven toasted, the meat and cheese were fresh and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed. I highly recommend these sandwich shops if in the Chicago Area.",

I suspect management doesn't check up on this location because the staff is rude and apathetic, which is probably not comforting at all to the people whose kids are in the hospital. In addition to the slow service, I saw staff talking negatively about customers, even though the customers were polite and patient. One staff person was even complaining about having to work at all. Solution: quit and let someone who needs a job and has a work ethic work there instead. I was also surprised management allows staff to dress as if...well let's just say you see such fashion at 63rd and Halsted.",
