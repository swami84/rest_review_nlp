We loved most if not all of the dishes, especially the hay charred steak, gnocchi and the septagon. The frozen kumquat dish, not currently on the menu, was a such a nice treat - a great palate cleanser. The wine pairing was impeccable. The sommelier did a great job pinning the right libation with the associated tasting notes in each dish. The service overall was excellent and it was fun to see the kitchen in action. I would highly recommend Senia as great fine dining destination.",

Typically not a fan of fine dining fixed course menus, but having heard about this from multiple friends and food critics, my wife and I went to try it out.  Since we were only in Honolulu for a few days, we weren\u2019t able to get a reservation for dinner and opted to go there for lunch.  We both ordered their 3 course meals eirh the following items below: - Squash salad - Chopped salad - Confit  duck leg - Charred cabbage - Senia cookie  Wow!! It felt like there was a party in my mouth as each dish had a great distinct flavor. The Chopped Salad had a variety of greens, Salami, Avacados, garbanzo. Even though I\u2019m not a big veggie person, the Charred cabbage was wilding beyond my expectations. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  (Squash salad was the disappointment and would skip that)  The service itself was amazing as what you would expect with a fine dining establishment.  For parking, the closest parking garage is the public garage on Maunakea st & king st. No Validation.  Overall, while this place is known for their Omakase dinner menu, their lunch offering is great as well.",

Smell it, see it, feel the textures, experience all five senses on a plate. The service rivals the top restaurants in the world and I cannot reccomend this restaurant any more.",

When we ordered the risotto specially the server didn\u2019t think to tell us it was truffle and $60 a plate!  Shortly after we had 4 of the 8 dishes on the table. We had to ask our server to slow down, we\u2019d only been in the restaurant 20min. They slowed down with the service after we asked, to allow us to enjoy each dish.  Not all dishes pictured.",

Both chefs were out of town (boo) so we couldn\u2019t do the tasting menu but dinner was still extremely delicious and memorable! We ordered 5 dishes to share plus a dessert. Drinks were wonderfully crafted as well and you can\u2019t go wrong with any of the cocktails.  Highlights: Roasted bone marrow - I\u2019m not normally a bone marrow fan but this was AMAZING paired with the perfectly buttered bread *drool Charred cabbage- never thought I would be so excited for cabbage but the flavors in this dish blended together so well I was craving more after we finished Wagyu beef- a bigger portion intended to be shared- this was the best wagyu we\u2019ve tasted.. outside of Japan so definitely splurge on it if you\u2019re here already  This restaurant was definitely better than some of the Michelin\u2019s we\u2019ve had so I\u2019m definitely making this a mandatory stop every time we\u2019re in Oahu!",

Senia was suggested by a relative and it was amazing.  This gem has an open kitchen where you can watch these talented people put together a meal unlike you have ever had.  The shared dishes are three or four bite per person exquisite dishes.  Ordering three or four dishes for the two of us was perfect.  The waitstaff never bothers you but they always know exactly when to place the next dish or take away the last empty plating.  They are prepared to answer any and all questions and you can tell that they are as pleased to serve there as the chefs are to be culinary artists and we were to partake of one of our all time favorite meals.  If you miss this one you need to return to the islands to make it a must.",

My family and I had the pleasure of sitting at the chef's counter and we got to watch the kitchen work as we enjoyed our meal. The food is made to be shared which is great because you can try more dishes (they all were fantastic). The staff here was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, they all made us feel very comfortable. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, yet feels relaxed and not stuffy at all.  We also had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Chef Anthony Rush who was very kind and made for an unforgettable night.  Do yourself a favor and eat here as soon as you can. I know my wife and I already want to go back to Honolulu for the single purpose of enjoying another night at Senia.",

Es costoso el lugar, pero la experiencia estuvo excelente con sus platos y sus c\u00f3cteles. El Bone marrow fue el plato que m\u00e1s me encant\u00f3, es un plato muy bien armado, Charred Cabage y Tako a la Placha son mis preferidos. Vale la pena ir.",

I wish I could give them more stars.  First, quick shout out to our server, Martin. He was fun and bright and gave us recommendations on his favorite dishes (most of which we tried and he has my utmost trust from now on).  We started off with the ahi brioche which is not a menu item, but is apparently popular on their social media. It is AMAZING. Its ahi and an avocado on a homemade brioche and it explodes with flavor in your mouth. Absolutely incredible and you must try this if they have it.  The burrata was recommended to us by Martin and I wasnt sure if i would like it at first, but Im happy to say that I was so wrong. Saltiness from the goopy melty cheese, sweetness from the raisin puree and the truffle honey all over crunchy bread? That's hard to beat. I found myself enjoying it more and more with every single bite.  The charred cabbage is one of their signature dishes and very popular across social media. While this was also incredibly delicious for being a chunk of cabbage (make sure to drag it across as much of the sauce as you can), it was not my personal favorite.  Maine Sea Scallops. Incredible. They're soft on the inside. Crunchy on the tops and with the sauce and all of the accoutrements in one spoonful, it'll blow your mind.  Casoncelli with escargo and burgundy truffle shavings. This was one of my favorite pasta dishes of all time and definitely one of my favorites here. The pasta is cooked perfectly and the potatoes inside are delicious. This was my first foray into escargot and it was very very good. Everything sits in truffle and bacon oil and its a very rich dish overall.  The souffle cheesecake with the lilikoi marshmallows and the lime-avocado (its amazing) sorbet just all melts before it can hit your stomach. It's impossibly light.  The Freddie cocktail with the massive block of blood orange ice was so good. Definitely give that a shot.  Parking is found in the municipal lot in Marin Tower on Smith Street. It tops out at $3 so its quite reasonable.",

The dishes we had were very tasty, not too salty (as some places oversalt), and the portions were spot on for the price.  Great place to get a nice lunch in with great company.  Sorry didn't snap a pix of the lunch menu, but here are the dishes.  App was a \"Poke\" cracker, taste fresh and the crisp added a great texture contrast to the fish, first dishes were Tako, Beef Tartare, and the Kale & Quinoa salad - all were phenominal!  Main dishes were Porchetta, ahi burger, and I think a chicken burger - again, very tasty and not too salty!  All of these came with side of home fries which were really well cooked, crunchy outside and the inside was moist (careful not to eat it too fast because it was really (temp) hot) Finally desserts - Senia cookie w/ a cream and Ice cream and a Iemon bar with a cream/mousse.  Lemon bar was not too tart, the cookie was real moist and consisted of PB and Chocolate.  Very refreshing way to end a meal.",

We also indulged in the Kalua Pork & Cabbage Croquettes which were tasty but the sauce is what really made them. The Tako was cooked perfectly! We've tried octopus at a number of restaurants (including other JBs) and this was by far the best. Last, my absolute favorite was the scallops. These were heaven. Buttery, savory and a pure piece of art. To top off the perfect food, we had remarkable service. The waiter was attentive and friendly but allowed my husband and I enough space to truly enjoy our time with each other.",

I love the restaurant's space with built in booths along the mixed decor walls and the simple neutral color palette.  It's pretty, modern, and sophisticated.  I like that it's not stuffy so while it's an ideal venue for a date night, it's equally a great choice for an any-night dinner out...except Sunday night.  They are closed.  We were eager to order a bottle of wine, but the wine director suggested we look over the menu and decide what we would be ordering first.  After we decided on the oysters, poke crackers, salmon, kampachi, pork belly, foie gras, and bone marrow custard we asked for his recommendation on a nice pinot noir.  Both the wine and the food were excellent.  My favorites were the poke crackers, bone marrow custard, and kampachi.  We ended our meal with the sticky toffee cake and some Kona coffee from Kona Coffee Purveyors (my fave!).  I admit if you give me good wine and company I'll have a good time, but I sincerely enjoyed my experience at Senia.  The food is original and the service was warm.  I left wanting to shout from the rooftops for everyone to, \"Dine at Senia!  You will love it!!!\"  Instead, I settled with a facebook post and plans to take my husband.  What the heck; yolo.  Dine at Senia!  You will love it!  :D",
