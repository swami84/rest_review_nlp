Worst website ever for user friendliness. And I say that with 20 years experience of online buying.  But the pizza....  Because of the deal, I decided to give Domino's another try.  It has been about 4 years since Domino's opened close enough to make it an option.  Except for the website, I am glad I did.  This is the best tasting, best looking pizza I have gotten from Domino's  in Buffalo.  I think the secret, for me, is getting the hand tossed crust.  In past years I'd tried the regular and the thin crust.  In those pizzas each slice had 2 green beans, 1 or 2 pieces of sausage, and 1 or 2 mushrooms.  Always gave the impression  toppings were put on by computer.   This one looks like a pizza I'd make myself.  Another secret for me is getting carryout.   No problem with late and/or cold pizza.",

The driver honked like a mad man in the street . She then told me that can give me credit . I asked her if I can use it at another location she said no I would have to call the downtown location . I said ok well will I get before 2 hours . She got loud with me over the phone and asked if I knew how to count ? I asked her if she knew English ? 11:15 am to 1:00 pm estimated is about 2 hours . Worse place overly paid cold pizza ! Well here you the downtown branch is your perfect choice !",

As I was eating I smelled the smell of bacon and surely enough I come to find bacon on both the pasta and the pizzas. Only reason I am writing this review is because I want to make everyone aware of cross contamination. I would like my religious beliefs to be respected by not endorsing cross contamination practices most importantly and also have my food prepared they way it was requested with nothing more. Eventually I had to throw away the food and am left very dissatisfied. Please do better as a company!",

The first time they charged my card but when i called back 2 hours later to ask the status of my order they said I never ordered. Putting my fustration aside I decided to just redo my order right then and there. This time it finally went through but took another 3 hours to get to me and everything was cold. A month later I ordered again this time a bit earlier since I knew how long it took the last time for them to deliever. However that changed nothing and this time it was worse. They charged my card and after 6 hours, countless calls and them lying saying my order was on its way I call for the final time and it was a couple minutes after there closing time and they said \"your order was already delivered\" but when i told him it wasnt and gave him my number the man told me they didnt get an order from me and that I would have to call the manager tomorrow to see what happened. when i asked him will i get my food he just breathed heavily and hung up on me. They just took my money.",

I came by at exactly 1:32 AM to pick up my order, and the door was locked, the open sign was turned off, and the guy inside was busy closing out the register. I knocked on the window loud enough for him to hear me for nearly 3 minutes, but he didn't respond. I walked a block and a half back to my ride, got in, and was half way home when I got a call at 1:44 AM from the person there, asking if I was still coming to pick up my order. When I replied that I had already been there, he responded that the store \"was still open, the door was just locked and the sign was just turned off.\"  Yeah.  He then asked why I didn't call the store, and I would've, but I ran out of data on my phone a day or two ago, so I couldn't look it up. I've posted a picture of the front door with the time schedule on it so you know I'm not lying here. Don't bother with this place, the only thing I'm happy about was that I selected \"pay at store\" on the website instead of getting ripped off my money in addition to my time.",

Another friend of mine called back after my other friend hung up and asked to speak to the manager, told the manager about how they were unhappy with their customer service and all the manager had to say for herself was \"okayyy.\" They made sure to tell the manager that we will not be ordering from them and we will be telling all our friends on campus not to order from them and all the manager still had to say was \"okay.\" If you are looking for decent customer service, do not order from here. All you will get is one incredibly rude manager.",

The drivers will ignore the instructions and just sit outside in their cars waiting for you to come out and get the food from them. Food is iffy, 3 out of 4 times you order will be correct. But again, I have had the delivery drivers forget to give me sauce or drinks that I have ordered, multiple times.",
