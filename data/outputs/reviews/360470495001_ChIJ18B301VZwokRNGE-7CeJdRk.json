The soup was also very good. The broth was full of flavor as well it was the one with the duck. It's definitely big enough for two to share. The staff was very friendly and helped accommodate us.

The restaurant was almost empty when the three of us walked in. All the tables are 2-seaters. \"Can we move another chair to a table?\" we asked.  \"No,\" they said.  We stared at them and each other. Yes, they couldn't do anything for us. We left.  I went back twice more. Once at 3:30, and once at 3:50. (The alleged \"lunch special\" goes until 4.) Both times they were sitting inside and the closed sign was on the door. The second time I pushed it open and they confirmed that they were closed.  I dunno, I guess they just got tired of cooking and figured they'd have a cigarette or watch TV or something.  On the plus side, it's nice they're not overly burdened with responsibility. It's nice they listen to their inner voices. On the minus side, it's too bad their inner voices say \"F*** all these damn people who want food!\" They need to get into a business where their attitude would be appreciated. Maybe as IRS accountants, or spokespeople for President Trump.",
