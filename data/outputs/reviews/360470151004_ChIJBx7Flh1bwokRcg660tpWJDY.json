We usually order take out but this time decided to go sit at their street-seating and I have to say I was shocked and disappointed by what I experienced.  First, we were told to grab an empty table which was clearly not clean nor sanitized (we asked for it to be cleaned and it was).  We were then handed plastic menus that were clearly not cleaned in a long time, let alone since the previous customer (they were stained with food and finger prints).  Those things alone freaked me out enough, but then various other small things deepened the disappointment - service was slow; cutlery wasn\u2019t provided for all four of us and when we asked, we got some plastic utensils but were still short on what we needed; one of our noodle dishes was poorly done with way too much sauce and salt; and in general the outside area didn\u2019t look to be tended to very well with some rubbish lying around beneath the tables.  It seems to me like they are too busy to handle the demand and they are slipping.  We\u2019re all trying to be more patient with our neighborhood restaurants during these unprecedented times, but there is no room to drop the ball on hygiene and sanitation during a pandemic.  Will continue to give them a chance because I love the food but I will be more cautious going forward.",

I would have preferred it a tad spicier (I asked for Thai spicy) but the flavor was excellent.",

They gave us 4 settings and when they brought over the water one glass was half filled. Then we ordered drinks on the side our server brought 3 of the 5 drinks and then she blanked out. We had to asked for it.  The food was just ok. I've had better at other restaurants. Presentation wise the dishes looked great. Beware of the papaya salad. When they took our order they asked how spicy we would like it and we ordered mild. If that was the mild I would not order spicy from this place. I eat spicy foods all the time and that made me sweat. The rest of the party couldn't eat it.",

Luckily for me I stumbled onto this place on their first day and I'm so grateful for it, it means I could take the journey with them.  I've been there 3x's since they opened and I won't slow down until I try every dish! So far they have not missed a beat. Green curry chicken, Basil Chicken and Whole fried Branzino were all absolutely perfect, so delicious I forgot to take pics! This place will soon become impossible to get a table but hopefully they'll remember their original customers!",
