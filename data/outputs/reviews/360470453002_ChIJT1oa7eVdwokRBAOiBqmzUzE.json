The cocktails were MIND BLOWING , with names like : Purple People Eater , Cherry Bomb and  Bushwick Passion. Each one was not overly sweet, but had intense flavor that used unique ingredients. The servers were knowledgeable about all the food and drink options and were very attentive and motivated. Definitely kid friendly, Can\u2019t wait to go back . Thank you Chef Fernandes!",

It took us a very long time to order despite not being the busy. The wings had a great sauce but it was so hard !! It was like eating old wings that were refried a bunch of times. I didn\u2019t go during happy hour so would not recommend full price. The dumpling were alright. I also got the pork belly which had the same problem of feeling like it was old. The problem here is that the meat didn\u2019t feel fresh. The sauce on the other hand was amazing. Very flavorful.",

Originally my friend and I were going to Northwinds, but they were full in outdoor seating and these people did not look like they were going to move for a long while. We noticed immediately next door was Sweet Chili. We were so happy to dine here. Only 1 table was occupied,  but by the time we started ordering,  the place was full. We dat down at 555pm, 5 mins before the end of happy hour and John allowed us to order happy hour drinks and food. We ordered the $1 dumplings and $1 wings. The wings were ok, but the dumplings were really good.  I ordered the Bangkok Mule, and it was very refreshing.  My friend ordered the Pandan painkiller which has alot of rum, but was very subtle in in strength. It was really good. I then ordered a Liquid Pad Thai, again a really good drink but felt light or maybe I had too much already,  who knows. The drink did not last long and then I ordered the Spicy Watermelon drink and that was amazingly refreshing.  Meanwhile for food, I ordered the combo which included a vegetable roll, General Tso's chicken and broccoli with rice and i also ordered the papaya salad. The papaya salad was not bad, not as spicy as I was hoping for but very edible.  During this whole time, both John and Nicole kept checking back and they are both awesome in terms of customer service. Nicole is beautiful inside and outside. They both recommended good menu suggestions and they were spot on. I made sure I gave them a nice tip for their services. It was certainly worth it. I would without hesitation return here even just for the drinks.",

While in the neighborhood we decided to stop by for dinner, and we were so glad we did!  Everyone working there was incredibly friendly and the entire place felt so warm and welcoming.  We have an 18mo daughter and appreciate that they are kid-friendly, while also being a nice place to go and hang out and have some drinks with dinner too.  They have high chairs and a changing table in their wonderfully-gender-neutral bathroom.  There is even a kid's menu, and our daughter loved her chicken fried rice.  Chef Lisa has outdone herself and expanded her menu from the food truck, while keeping many of the classic flavors we had enjoyed before.  There are also fun, unique drinks and dessert options.  If you live in the area or are passing through, definitely put this place on your list!",
