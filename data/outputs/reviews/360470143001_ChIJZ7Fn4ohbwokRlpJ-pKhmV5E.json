First of all let me just say, that everything I've had here is great, but that salmon sandwich touched my soul. It was absolutely delicious and the salmon was perfectly cooked. They vary the bread they serve it on but I think the Texas toast added something extra. I highly, HIGHLY recommend getting something from these guys. P.S. I also love the names of their sandwiches. Nice way to pay homage to Brooklyn. UPDATE: I had the buffalo shrimp mac & cheese yesterday. DE.LI.CIOUS!! But I also forgot to say their MUFFINS! If you haven't had one before you have to try it. Especially the blueberry.",

It's worth mentioning now that prices have raised, so that, for example, the Sterling Place is $14.75. The sandwiches are still really good, but now you have to be prepared to dish out an extra $3-4 over regular delis, and I'm not sure if that's justified.  Always really well made sandwiches. They're also super friendly. If you're willing to spend the extra $1-2, if definitely beats out bodega sandwiches and is a nice actual sandwich establishment. Subs N Stuff around the corner is also really good.",
