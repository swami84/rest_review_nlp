At the checkout, the waiter asked whether the soup should be packed. We said that the taste was not good, so we didn't want it. As a result, their manager came over and said that they returned the two dishes, which cost 25 yuan for soup and 13 yuan for dishes, to the card and waited for the next meal to be used against cash. We ate more than 160 and gave 200 for the rest as tips. And this time I went there. It was not about the money in the card. It was just an ordinary 9 discount card. I felt cheated.

Loved their spicy pot of seafood and vegetables, spicy noodles, chicken with lots of hot peppers, the most tasty cauliflower I ever had, tasty peashoots and pretty good dumplings. Their service is excellent. But beware of their steps going up and even more going down where they seat larger groups. Not wheelchair accessible. Difficult for anyone with physical challenges. Also their bathroom downstairs was filthy. Only one for both men and women and the men left wetness around the toilet if you know what I mean. Had the bathroom been clean and the place more accessible would have given them  5 stars.",

Went with a group of 5 and ordered the Pork with Garlic Sauce, Chengdu Noodle, Potato Floss, Chengdu Wontons (they don\u2019t have dumplings anymore is what they said), Pineapple Fried Rice, Hibachi Japanese Tofu and the Chongqing Sour Fish I believe.  Most of the dishes simply had the spicy oil, which had no taste. The Pork with Garlic Sauce, Potato Floss, Chengdu Wontons and Pineapple Fried Rice all tasted just mediocre, nothing too special that stood out, but didn\u2019t taste terrible either. The Pineapple Fried Rice would\u2019ve tasted better if there was more flavor, but it was too bland. I do not recommend the Chengdu Noodle because it\u2019s not really noodles but some jello-like thing with no taste since it just had spicy oil. The Chongqing Sour Fish was simply fish (with some bones, not completely fillet style) with the preserved vegetable type of base. That was alright and had a big portion, but it just depends on your preferences.  The only dish that I did really like was the Hibachi Japanese Tofu as the sauce and egg tofu mixed well together. While the service was not bad, I was not particularly fond that they kept asking if we were ready to order every three minutes or so when it was evident we were still perusing the menu. The place also was not that big so we could have easily asked for a waiter/waitress to come over when we were ready. It was not near their closing time either so I was unsure why they kept questioning whether we were ready. Other than that, no major issues with the service since they were still pretty kind in informing us which dishes could be made non-spicy or less spicy as some of my friends could not take spice that well.",

I came here a few times before and I've been coming back again. It is one of the best Szechuan places I have tried so far. Every time I come, I bring a different group of people with me and they all complimented the food was good. This place has a variety of selections on the menu. And they serve a pot tea and refills it.  The only reason I gave them four stars is that the service was not great but not the worst neither. Just a bit above average in general. It's one of those typical Chinese services you couldn't ask for more. lol. An inexperienced waitress spilled chili sauce on my friend's new boot and she didn't apologize about it.  Well, the boot is difficult to clean especially when it was new. So it was a frustrating experience. We wanted the tip back :( Can't they train their new staffs appropriately?  Anyhow, I will come back for the food but just don't feel the tip is worth it to the terrible services sometimes...",

The taste of the previous service and dishes has always been good, but recently I feel that the weight of the dishes is getting less and less, and the service is getting worse! Because I knew that they had preferential activities, the cash checkout was 8.5 discount.  Before the order, I asked the waiter to confirm it. It was correct. As a result, when I paid the bill, I gave it a discount of 9.5. I feel like I was cheated! Before serving, there was a free peanut gift. As the children were hungry, they quickly ate it. The waiter could come back for another dish. As a result, I gave a few peanuts. I asked if I could come more? Immediately they were told by their waitress to charge, it doesn't matter, there is no problem with the charges, we bought a peanut; we ordered the boiling fish and spicy double crisp because there is soup. After the meal, you can take the soup and bring it home to cook the noodles. As a result, the waiter dumped all of our soup, and only brought the side dishes left at the bottom of the pot to us! Every time we spend about $200, it is really difficult for me to accept such a service! Decided not to go to this restaurant again!",

(There were two noodles on menu with same name, I had the JaJa Mein style ones)  The noodles were some of the tastiest I've had in this form. Portion wise I would say it's good as a small starter to share between two people. If I was having it as my main meal, I would need to have two orders but would be happy and full cause it was delicious.  The Sour Fish is definitely a share portion for 2 people, maybe 3 depending on what else you're ordering. Personally it was a bit on the spicy side for me, but my tolerance for spicy food is not high. Also, I'm not going to let that effect the rating as this is a Szechuan restaurant so you already know what you're getting yourself into.  I like this place because the food was flavorful, the wait staff was nice, and the presentation of the food was great. Will be coming back to try other items on the menu that caught my eye that I couldn't get to this time.",

A new generation of Chinese immigrants seems to be keen on opening regional cuisines in this and other neighborhoods in the city with a lot of Chinese residents. This is probably the first one in Sunset Park to really excel at the craft of Sichuan cooking, and is a real welcome. Scroll through for 10 photos of some of the dishes we enjoyed, which while some were spicy the focus was more on sophisticated flavor profiles than on heat and numbing.",
