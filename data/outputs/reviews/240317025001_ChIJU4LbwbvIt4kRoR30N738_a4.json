A question, how long do I have to wait outside for you guys to open the door? Because I was waiting for 20 minutes while someone was inside, looking at me and ignoring me to then scream from a far that it was closed, AT 5:30PM, while having an \u201cOPEN\u201d sign on and hours up that say 11:30 am to 11:00pm.

I got a message that it had been canceled as well as a call from an unknown number which turned out to belong to the driver, who said the restaurant was not open. Usually if a Grubhub restaurant isn't open yet there is something to that effect in the system, so I was surprised. I looked them up on Mapquest and it said they were open so I tried again. I used a \"first order\" credit the first time but it didn't come up when I tried again: since they hadn't indicated they were closed I didn't feel I should lose the coupon, so I called Grubhub to see about restoring it. Went to order again - by that time it was about 12:30 (and Mapquest showed them as open), so I tried again. And got another cancelation! NOW they show in Grubhub as closed until tomorrow morning. Hey, if you're shorthanded or something I feel for you, but please make sure your info is current.",

While I was mentally stuck on the greeting, the man who answered began to spew forth random menu features, pricing, and an inexplicably complex desert menu.  I let the man ramble. I could tell that if I rocked the boat, he would have needed to start all over again. After he finished, I told him I would like to place an order. I wanted a gyro and some soup. I realized this was not going to be a simple conversation. Each of the two items I wanted came with a bevy of options, back stories, and suggestions.  I was told that the \u201cnew\u201d gyro platter boasted \u201ca lot more meat\u201d than before. My spider sense tingled again. I struggled with the framing of his statement. Why was he being myopic just about meat? A gyro consists of meat and other things that are equally important, yet meat was all he cared about. Perhaps vegans tormented him and he was showing a passive-aggressive approach to righting the meat-vegetable balance in the world. He seemed to be warning me and informing me all at the same time. I assumed the gyro platter would be a gyro - a pita with all the toppings - and meat. I agreed to order the enhanced platter.  What next followed was the single most painful discussion that ever took place on planet earth about soup. I had no idea broth and a few extra things could generate so many words. I\u2019ll spare you. I settled in for the long haul. I was no longer upset. I was fascinated with this strange man on the phone. He was confused and enlightened all at the same time. For a brief moment, I thought I saw god. The order for 2 items was placed. The call ended. My phone informed me the call was 12 minutes in length.  My adventure was just beginning.  The soup, once a delicious, lemony concoction, was now a warm liquid with strong hints of Campbell\u2019s. The soup tasted like something I expect them to serve at maximum security prisons. I ate it, but it did nothing for my soul - which is exactly what chicken soup should do. The real moment when time stood still was when I opened the container on my gyro platter and was shocked to see nothing but a pile of meat and some fries. No pita.  No onions. Nothing. I immediately thought back to the earlier taunt of \u201ca lot more meat.\u201d  Technically he was right, but he was also so wrong at the same time.  What once was my favorite hole-in-the-wall place in Silver Spring is now a bizarre alternate reality.",
