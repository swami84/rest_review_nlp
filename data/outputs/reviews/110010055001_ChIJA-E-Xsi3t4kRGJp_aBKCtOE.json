I returned recently and my companion declared the gyro the best he'd ever had. I'm still in love with the spanikopita.  As noted in other reviews, though, the prices on the menu  are not what you're charged at checkout, and that's not OK.  I'm in love with the spanakopita, apparently on the menu as 'spinach samosa.'  The first time I happened upon this place I'd asked about the spinach wrap, but they were out and he suggested this instead.  Little triangular spinach pies, with flakey phyllo outside and a light almost mousse of spinach and sauce inside. OMG.  Especially dipped into the home made hummus and tzatziki*.  Great reviews from companions of the DC platter and the Chicken Gyro as well.   I've also had the baklava and another dessert, and was quite happy with them.  DC cafe is open late, to 1a on weeknights and apparently later on weekends.  He seems to make everything when ordered so it's not immediately out, but if you're eating in he'll bring it to the table.  Cash is better than card; there's an ATM outside.  * again, not what I think of as tzatziki - far thicker and perfectly tangy.  I wasn't sure what it was until I asked, but I wanted to eat every bit.",

There was no discussion of how late it was or how much business had come through it was basically a discussion of the history of the past of the area where he had come from and how fantastic the food was and it was awesome.

Even the basics like the rice and salad -- stuff that is all too often bland and boring -- really shine here.",

The old guy who prepared my food asked if I wanted an extra pita bread (assuming that it's free? or probably should cost less than $1), so I said yes. The order comes with only 1 pita by the way.  So as I was ready to pay, he said it was $9.99. I was confused. Why is it so much?  $3 more is a bit much for a DC Tax (5.57%). And no where it stated that there's minimum for a credit card either. So I asked him why is it $9.99 instead of $6.99? Without any proof he said because he gave me an extra pita (lie #1) and tax (lie #2). What a shady business and worse terrible  business ethic! Lesson to learn -- if you must go to this place to eat, make sure you have cash handy and confirm the price as listed on their menu before you pay for your food. This place truly left a bad taste in mouth.",
