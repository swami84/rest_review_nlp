There is outdoor seating due to covid or you can order takeout/ delivery. The location is conveniently nestled among other great restaurants but surely stands out.

No tables were available, which was to be expected, but they were kind enough to seat us at the bar. The place was super busy for the holiday, but the staff were absolutely killing it. Food and drinks came quick and were delicious as always.  So glad to have such a great Thai option in the neighborhood, and I'm looking forward to coming back on a less busy day to sample some of their interesting cocktails (which are, according to the menu, Bangkok-inspired and unique to NYC).",

The appetizers and drinks are also excellent, I would recommend the curry puffs, octopus rings (basically thai calamari) and the shrimp rolls.

        "caption": "Awful. I've had to send something back each time I've been there. When you send something back you need to look at the check to make sure they still don't charge you for it. When I first went in they didn't have knives - I had to run to the Chinese place across the street for a plastic knife. They give your water with no ice.  The food is meh. Pad Thai is a big mush, probably some of the worst I've had in Brooklyn. Papaya salad tasted like fish. They're usually out of the specials and desserts. Curry puffs are probably the best thing on the menu, but nothing to write home about.  They have soggy wood tables and don't wipe down the big communal cushioned bench against the wall unless requested, even if it is visibly dirty.  If you have the Groupon then go ahead but be prepared for the worst sit down restaurant in Bay Ridge. Sad really, the location is known for being a cursed spot and I can't see it being open much longer with the sparse amount of business in it nightly.",

Would be good to hold a small party. Prices are good and there is a lunch special for $8. Closed on WED!!!  Today was a tasting and I was served Curry Puffs and Pad Thai Chicken. The curry wasn't strong and the puff was very crispy. Along with that came a dipping sauce of vinegar with cucumber and sweet onion-this is good! Next was Pad Thai, the noodles were overcooked but there was plenty of meat and bean sprouts  in a gingery peanut butter sauce-that was ok. The owner doesn't understand English but she can cook a nice meal. People in the area enjoy the place and eat here often. It has A rating and we also came while the Health Inspector was there. One downfall-there is an area before the kitchen which is used as an office and playing area for the children of the owner.",

After a wait of not knowing what was happening, the waitress (we soon found out was the owner) said we would be served soon.  For the tasting we received some Curry Puffs and Pad Thai Chicken, the Puffs were very tasty with just the right amount of curry, the Pad Thai was a bit soft for my taste.  The place is small can only sit about 20 or so and has a small bar. The decor was nice with brick walls and some nice paintings hanging. The bathrooms were also clean.  I would go again for a full meal if I was in the area again.",
