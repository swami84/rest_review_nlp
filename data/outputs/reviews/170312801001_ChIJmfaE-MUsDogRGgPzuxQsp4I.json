Quick resolution after he reached out. Later ordered cheesy bread and their calzones (Sausage, Make your Own and Steak). The order received was great and the calzones were very tasty.  \"Ordered a \"Classico Italiano\" pizza as well as cheesy bread for delivery.   Never received the cheesy bread and the pizza was undercooked with the crust still doughy.  Called location to ask for them to fix the issue.  Spoke with a manager who promised a refund that was never received.  Have followed up an additional two times with no refund still being issued.   Even had an employee leave a message with my name and phone number. Extremely disappointed in this location and will not be ordering here again.\"",

Attempted to call and speak to a manager spoke with a young lady named Alicia who told me that it was nothing she could do because I ordered from a 3rd party which is gosarpinos.com which I thought was a there website. Definitely not 100 percent customer satisfied, I order from this restaurant all the time and this is the first time my order was wrong and that I received bad service.

Taste, flavor and heat all excellent the sauce and seasoning Sarpino's uses is amazing to me. You really get that pizza taste, the right blend of all ingredients from sauce to crust YUMMY for my TUMMY. If you have never tried the Chicken Alfredo pizza you are in for a treat.

Sarpino's is open late, which can be useful for people who work overnight. I usually order a medium spinach \"build your own\"  pizza which is a fine size for 2 people, or just 1 if you want leftovers. Sometimes I save money and order a calzone, which by default comes with 3 toppings. I like to get some combination of green/red peppers, spinach, feta cheese or artichoke hearts.  The greatest thing about Sarpino's is their delivery service. Some days it can be lightening fast, other days it can take up to an hour. The delivery drivers are usually great, though. There is no delivery fee and I generally make it a point to tip the driver.  Once or twice I've had delivery issues with Sarpino's, but most of my experiences have been good. I have never really had any issues with this specific location, though.",

I was sceptical when a pizza place in Chicago said it would arrive in 45 minutes when that is the normal time in the country. 1 hr and 15 minutes later I called to check on the pizza that was already 30 minutes late. I was told it was out for delivery but wasn't given an ETA. Another 45 minutes after that we called again wondering why our pizza ordered within 1 mile of my hotel was taking so long when there was no traffic out. I was told it was 5 minutes away and when it finally arrived 2 hours after ordering it I received my pizza cold and the breadsticks were missing. The manager claimed it was policy to only refund the customer if the food was taken back. When asked what they would do with the cold pizza, that they wouldn't even give a discount on, let alone refund he claims it would go to \"the needy.\" The manager was overall rude and even though he claimed to be trying to help he was extremely unhelpful and shouldn't be managing a restaurant. I've managed a restaurant for 10 years and given numerous discounts if not free food to customers because we weren't timely or got the order wrong... if you don't give good service you compensate to retain the business but according to this gentleman you can't run a business giving away free food. I would never order from this location again and everyone should stay away.",

We asked for the manager who was even worse when we asked for a discount of some sort for waiting 2 HOURS. They're .5 miles away from our location. The manager started YELLING at us through the phone telling us we're \"trying to get a free pizza, I'm not going to give you your money back!!\" Food was cold and we are missing part of our food. Called back and once again he's refusing to refund us or bring us new items. He claims they are going to give the pizza to the \"needy\" since apparently we aren't needy even though we've waited this long. The staff and manager has hung up on us 3 times now. STAY AWAY!!!",

After placing an order the eta changed and doubled on Grubhub, I work late and get deliveries later a lot and know to be patient but I was disappointed, especially since I was .9 miles from the restaurant.The quality was very poor, it reminded us of a tombstone half cooked half cut pizza but tombstone would have been better. :( The crust was decent, the closer to the center of the pizza the more mushy it became. Will never return here, you guys should listen to your previous reviews and apply them. I bet if I got this pizza fresh, hot and cut a little better it would have been really delicious.",

He said he would have his manager call back. I won't hold my breath...  I will tell you this: if this company hires drivers who can't drive - it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to imagine that their pizza is so awful (it is absolute trash) because they hire cooks that can't cook. These guys don't care.  I sincerely doubt this gets any sort of response from anyone at Sarpinos. But their god-awful reviews are better than what they deserve.",

The reason being is they are one of the only delivery places that deliver late and with my lifestyle I tend to eat late. I can\u2019t really comment on their pizza but their cheese tortellini and cheesy bread sticks are great. I\u2019m giving them 5 stars not because I think they are the most amazing place in Chicago with the most amazing food but I think for what they offer- late night delivery, consistently satisfying food, quick delivery service, and free delivery. They deserve this rating.",

The individual on the phone was at first very friendly. I told her about the credit, and she said she was going to talk to a manager regarding my credit. She put me on a 1 minute hold, got back on the phone, was EXTREMELY rude, and said they can't do anything. I told her the error is in her end, and she told me she couldn't do anything.

HE NEVER CALLED MY PHONE and I was waiting at the door the entire time!!! At 11:40pm I was told the pizza would be redelivered but by 1am I still had no pizza. I called EIGHT times and they would not answer my call but when I called from my friend's phone they answered right away. Long story short 3:30am, I still had no pizza.
