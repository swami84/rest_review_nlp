We walked along the river walk until we came to the restaurant, but was met with a blockaid that said \"dead end\" and told by a group of drunk people on the patio (who turned out to be employees) \"you can't come in here.\"  We assumed they meant that we had to walk around to the other entrance, so we took the 10 minute hike all the way down by the street and street car tracks.  We were once again met with a dead end.  I called the restaurant and the very nice man on the line said that they were closed INDEFINITELY.  and they had only found out about 3 hours prior.  I think that says something as to what kind of people run this place.  I'm more curious to know why this place has not been marked as closed yet on Google???",

The waitress purposely walk buy us and would not look at us. The bartender kept looking at us and went and told a waitress something while looking at us. She shook her head no. Then he went a guy that looked management. Again was looking us and nothing. So we got up and sat at the bar. He immediately helped us. We ordered and he got our drinks and put the order in. The gator was not as expected. Guess that's our fault. Then, watched them put a cluster of snow crab in the \"hand sink only\" sink and ran water on it. Odd, but it did not click until I watched them put it on my plate. That's how they serve snow crab? Gross. They served us but I guess they did not hand wash it long enough because it was like eating a crab slush. Anyway, long and short. Food is ok. Service is BAD and they dont really care. This was at 8:45 pm and they close at 10pm. So dont think that's why.",

Got seated next to where the servers use the computer for billing and they would all gather there to mess with each other and were hooting and hollering the whole time. Had a live band but it was night club loud so you had a hard time talking to anyone at the table. Watched a waitress or maybe even the manager eat food off someones plate while it was sitting there waiting to be delivered to a table. Most of the people working looked like they had worn the same set of clothes out the night before on bourbon street. They need to wipe out their staff and scrub the place from top to bottom and start over. I would never ever eat there again or recommend it to anyone I like. Better off at red lobster",

He grew up in New Orleans so is no stranger to good seafood.. but after eating there we both agreed it was an extremely disappointing dining experience... To begin with, he ordered a lobster (his favorite food) and it came out so fast that we were impressed, and curious about HOW it came out so fast.. then when he took a bite of it, it was very apparent his lobster was already cooked and was re heated. hands down the toughest and most horribly seasoned seafood we have EVER had in New Orleans! Aside from that, I ordered the \u00e9touff\u00e9e which is a staple for me every time we visit the city, and I have never had a bad \u00e9touff\u00e9e in New Orleans, until eating here.. it was just all around bad quality seafood, especially for the price. I wish I could say something positive about the experience, but even the cleanliness of the establishment was HORRENDOUS! I took my 4 year old to the restroom and as soon as we opened the door we were literally SLOSHING around in water on the floor.. or, we HOPE it was water and not sewage leaking as it had all sorts of debris, toilet paper, etc floating around in the puddles... I honestly do not even know how a restaurant (even in New Orleans) can stay open with that kind of presentation for its guests. SAVE YOUR MONEY, and your time, and go somewhere else!!!",

From the second we walked in, we quickly realized that all the poor reviews were 100% accurate and that this place has some serious service and management problems.  We were there at 4pm and of course the restaurant was not really busy.  We were seated in the outside covered area where the window coverings were all rolled down making the whole area feel like a sauna - just a build up of hot, humid, stagnant air.  I figured I just ask the waitress to roll them up when they came to our table.  Problem was, they never came to our table.  We waited there for 15 minutes without anyone ever coming with menus, waters, ect.  While waiting I watched a server woof down a bunch of food in plain view of the dining area and then went on to wait on a table without washing her hands.  I also saw 3 other staff just leaning against a wall loudly talking, doing nothing.  I've worked in food service for a total of 17 years of my life, from expensive restaurants to small time pizza places and I have never witnessed such atrocious service on a number of levels.  Whoever is in charge of this place should be immediately fired because it is clear that there is no standards or accountability.  The fact that my review is not an isolated incident shows that despite a long track record of problems, management or ownership has done nothing to rectify the problems.  In a city where there is so many awesome places to eat, this place is not worth your money or frustration.  After 15 minutes we walked out.  The sad part was I don't think any employees noticed that either or if they did they didn't care.  We then walked over to the Gumbo Shop near Jackson Square and had one of the best meals of the trip with impeccable service.  I should have just went with my gut and went there to begin with.",

As we are ordering he says the kitchen is closing in a few minutes again. Keep in mind there are 2 other tables with people of non color and he distinctly went out of his way to be helpful.

It's like eating in the center of the pre-katrina projects...like who hires some of these people. While making a complaint to the manager about how rude my waitress was, this ghetto girl with a plastic weave glued onto her head was just standing there laughing in my face. I paid her no mind because  I know how they like to fight and I'm never o.k. with violence. I tried to handle it nicely by first letting my waitor know that I was dissatisfied with service, he didn't take it very well so I asked for his manager. He then yelled at me... \"go tell her, she right ova dea!!! Tell whoever you want!!!\" (In front of the entire restaurant) I was appalled, to say the least... I swear I thought he would hit me. I disengaged immediately. I then asked a man standing next to him at the register to please get me a manager. He pointed and said \"she right over there just go walk up, she'll talk to you.\" Me:    \u2620... Crazy thing is the general manager was there. I spoke to her and the manager. They both apologized but it was almost like this was the norm. The general manager said that she would talk to him immediately.... I was so confused...in my head I'm like... talk to him??? He just yelled at me...at that point, I knew it was hopeless. I still plan on contacting corporate just to inform them of the experience and to let them know how their brand is taking a good dragging by the people they chose to hire. There are a couple more jawdropping incidents during this visit but after this book i just wrote, this is all the energy I can spare for now...As good as that mahi sandwich was, I will never go back...but if you still choose to go after this review, get the GROUPON so you don't feel too bad about the\ud83d\uddd1service. #corporatecleanhouse",

        "caption": "Buyer beware!!!  Now I know why they have a groupon for this. Worse dining experience is not even enough to describe how bad it was. I went here for a date night with my husband. We had to wait for more than 10 min for a waiter to come to our table and it wasn't even a busy time, there were only a few customers in the restaurant. The menu was a bit confusing to us as some of the pricing was not clear. We finally decided to get the lobster salad and bourbon street combo.  After a while, the band started playing and we our table was so close to them that we can't hear each other talking. The band wasn't there when we were seated and the waiter didn't mention anything about it, nor did he bother to care ask us if we want a different table when we told him how loud the band is and how we have difficulty hearing one another because of this.  Finally the food came. The portion was small definitely not worth the price they ask for. Not only that, you have to do everything by yourself. The lobster in the lobster salad is not mixed in with the veggies. It's just served in its shell so we have to dig it out ourself, which wasn't easy because the lobster was tough and rubbery (I've never had lobster that tough, even in cheap place) it even made my jaw sore chewing it. The veggies in the salad was only iceberg lettuce (the cheapest kind), a shaving of carrot that was barely there, tomato, and 2 little slices of green pepper. The lobster salad was not the only \"DIY\" project during our dining time. The shrimp in the bourbon street combo was not peeled so we had to peel it ourselves. And yes, the shrimp was also tough. To top it off, we asked for the lobster salad to be delivered first (as it was an appetizer) but they brought all the food all at once. So there we were, struggling to mix our lobster with the veggies while our main course was getting cold.  Finally after we were done eating, it took a while for the waiter to come and take our payment. So my husband went to (what seemed like ) the cashier. The lady told him that we could only do payment through our waiter. Not a big deal, but still additional negative thing after everything we went through. Turned out she was the manager. My husband tried to tell her about the issues we were having and instead of trying to rectify the situation, she was being aggressively defending the situation. Not even a single apology for all the issue we had. So much for a customer service attitude!  Never again will I come here! Bad food, way overpriced, bad service. Nothing is good about this place!!!",

After sitting down, we ordered bottled waters and bottled beer....and it took over 20 minutes to receive them.  Food came out faster than we thought it would after the drink fiasco, but when it came time to get the checks, oh boy.  The server agreed to split them, though it's against their policy, but it's as if she totally forgot about it.  45 minutes to get the check?  And oh yeah, do you remember the woman from check in?  Turns out she's a manager who wasn't managing anything.  She did nothing to help us get checked out faster, and the only time she seemed to care was when we started to leave having never received the bill.  Rather than apologizing, she fought with multiple guests in our party.  All in all, a 2+ hour ordeal and headache was NOT a good start to our vacation.  Terrible customer service, and NO professionalism from the \"manager.\"",

First, we had to wait for a hostess as she was busy talking with her friends, then she walks to the stand, no acknowledgement, she simply picked up two menus and walked away, and then after she walked away she looked back with a mean face like we were stupid and should have known to follow her, we were seated without her saying a word.  We were seated in fact by the General Manager John and his family, and had the pleasure of watching him and his family enjoy multiple waiters and heaping plates of food.  While we waited for service.  After 30 min a waitress approached us and asked us if we had been waited on, we said no, and she said she wasn't sure if we were her table, she left and came back 10 min later and apologized and said she was our waitress.  We ordered drinks and off she went, 10 min later she was back with drinks, Be aware you will pay for water, 2.00 per bottle.  The bloody mary $14.00 was drinkable but nothing special.  We then ordered our entree's I ordered the Crawfish ettouffee and my fiance ordered a bowl of gumbo and the taste of new orleans which was Jambalaya, Etouffee, and redbeans.  Listen I cant stress this enough we grew up on the gulf coast we understand how Gumbo and the other dishes are supposed to taste, if your not from the area you have no idea, so to you it might be good, but let me tell you the food was horrible, the etouffee had no flavor and the gumbo's roux was watery and again had no flavor. The rest of the food was simply not good.  We had purchased a groupon for this place and that included a dessert and so we ordered the bread pudding, again it was horrible, it was tough and rubbery.  That was it, we had had it, so we asked to speak with John the general manager, 20 seconds into our conversation he basically dismissed us and said dont worry ill take care of the meal, while that was generous that wasn't really what we wanted to hear, we continued to try and explain our issues, he then got extremely rude, explained that he was the GM for a multi million dollar operation and if things were that bad, the restaurant wouldn't make it, I disagree, they have a fantastic location on the river in the riverwalk center, and there are plenty of unaware tourist that pay his bills.  He even told me to contact the owner that he would tell me the same thing.  I have yet to do so but im curious as to what his response will be.  The only pleasure I received from the meal was watching countless customers get up and walk out after not receiving service and the fact that I personally was able to turn away 2 groups saving them from a horrible experience.  Take my warning to heart, bad food, bad service, bad management.",

Without question one of the most fantastic dinners we have had in a while. This is not to say, the prices were cheap, but very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the feast. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting new Orleans. Great food, excellent service, and nice views of the Mississippi river traffic. She and I have traveled a good deal for business across this country back when the corporate credit card was still my friend. We could not remember a better experience. Crazy Lobster is going to be the new high water mark for us. Thanks!",

My sisters and I went to this restaurant for dinner 3 times while I was in New Orleans.  The food was great each day.  I am rating it a one because of the service received by our waitress named Regina.  She was horrible and very rude.  We were not given utensils for our seafood or bibs.  No water. And when asked she got upset and mocked my sister as if she was talking to a complaining child.  She was throwing things down on the table and just outright nasty.  She came to our table several times asking for our checks before we even finished our food.  I am sure that this behavior was because of the mandatory 20% tip that was automatically added to our bill.  I finally had had enough and asked for the manager.  The manager Ashley Smith was just as rude and openly intimidated by Regina who snatched our ticket from Ashley's had and went over to the cash register to cash our ticket our.  We were asking that the tip not be paid to Regina because of the service we had received, but it was too late because she cashed the ticket out.  There were two other tables that had the same issue with Regina and asked for manager assistance.  At first Ashley refused to come out and speak with the guest, but because they refused to sign their receipts until she came..she came out.  One lady said she would only sign if her tip went to the other waitress who helped her even though it was not his table.  And the other lady wanted the tip taken off her bill.  This was the worst experience anyone should have to endure.  I asked was there anyone over Ashley that we could speak with and was told no.  It was obvious that Ashley could not handle the staff and someone else should have be present.  Would not recommend do to staffing issues, however the food was great.  And the other two nights the staff was great.",

The seafood platters had fried oysters, fried shrimp, fried catfish, hush puppies, a delicious crab cake, and French fries. We all thought the items on the platter were very good, and we were unable to find anything that was lacking. Portions were generous, and the childrens' plates came it little paper fishing boats, and they were thrilled about that. We received two free tasty bread puddings when we promised to post written reviews online. I would strongly recommend this place. RJT",

Cajun Popcorn Crawfish battered, and fried to perfection, seasoned with Cajun spices. Delightful little pops of swamp mud bugs. The batter was light and crisp, a crunchy carrier for the muddy swamp bugs which tasted very fresh and plumb. Crab cake, crabmeat blended with seasoned bread crumbs, battered and fried, served with remoulade sauce. This was all crabmeat and very little bread crumbs. There was crab in every bite. Jambalaya a Louisiana tradition. Shrimp, chicken, and Cajun sausage smothered with Cajun spices and rice. The rice was moist and shrimp and chicken fresh. The sausage was perfectly seasoned and cured.  A dozen fresh shucked oyster came on ice. I wondered if the shucker reached out the back window and caught these oysters? Fresh, plumb, and huge, these oysters would make New Orleans proud. Abita Purple Haze was the perfect adult beverage to accompany this meal.
