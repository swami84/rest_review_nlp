While small, it caught my eye 7 years ago was one of those rare findings that you just feel lucky you stumbled upon. The pizza here is some of the best in New York. The dough is light and crispy, yet strong to hold toppings. The tomato sauce I believe is something this place has mastered, a marring of ingredients that is reminiscent of my childhood. Most orders are still made by the owner, (fit QG guy) something that I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen at other places. After all these years I\u2019m still impressed by the dedication and style he brings to pizza making, something my family enjoys seeing while orders are being made. It\u2019s typically busy, do to popularity with the locals, but we\u2019ll worth the wait. We tend to come earlier in the day so usually not much of a wait for us.",

But this pizzeria is trying host itself up by charging restaurant sit-in prices when it very much knows that it's selling $1 slices - it's a $1 dollar pizzeria shop trying to imitate a high price place. Listen, the pizza isn't even great. The pizzas are the exact same size as the $1 spots, but you're charge 2 or 3 times more. I wish I could draw picture, but I'll offer a scale instead: a normal slice is like a quarter and should cost amount 3-5 dollars, a slice at this place is a dime and it cost 3-5 dollars. I paid $3 for a small pepperoni slice. When I finally heard the price I just got upset as I was receiving the box. It's not like they have pricing displayed anyways. So when you blindly order thinking it's going to be cheap, boom!!!!! Nope!!!!! I paid $9 bucks on slices I could have paid 5 bucks at  $1 place. I wouldn't be complaining if I actually got a normal size pizza for that amount. They also have horrible service as if you shouldn't react or be surprise at their over priced not even good pizza. Your prices have to be displayed or that's deception - \u00a7 20-708. Display of Total Selling Price by Tag or Sign. Please look it up?!?!!!!?!!!!?!!!!????",

My first and now only time visiting I didn't even get a chance to taste the food because they kept screwing up the order. I was forced to return the order and spent another 20 mins waiting for them to fix it only for them to get it wrong again. Then catch attitude when called out on it and asked me not to return, which is probably the best advice he could give anyone living or visiting the Lower East Side. Overall bad service. Can't really rate the food since I never received it nor have I received the money I spent. Very disappointing.  I guess I'll just have to stick with Dominos from now on..",
