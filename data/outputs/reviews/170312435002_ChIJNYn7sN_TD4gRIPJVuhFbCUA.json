        "caption": "Ahh! I figured it out. This is a cloud kitchen space called Bites On Superior which is in the Westline Food Junction that opened in Feb. and they hail from California. When I go that way I usually go to mHUB (see my review on that) but since the Shut-in 2020 happened I haven't been that way in a while. Now this is the best part, there are ten restaurants in there and they are Faim, Wendy's, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Fatburger & Buffalo's Express, Buffalo world famous wings, Wazam, Meatheads, Yalla, Famous Dave's, and Taco Joint! The rep that assisted me was Jes with one \"s\". She was very nice. There's another one which is the same  concept a mile away called \"United Kitchen Mix\".",
