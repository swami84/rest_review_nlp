Pico de gallo was pretty bland and watery. They asked me if i wanted my burrito spicy. I of course, said yes. They charged me an extra $.75!! The burrito didn't wind up being all that spicy. If you're in the area, go to the nearby Habanero, a much better and authentic option. I won't be going back.",

I got the cheese enchiladas and I've got to say the sauce was probably the worst part. It's not fresh, straight out of the can, you can taste the preservatives and it's not good. Not even spicy. I guess it's partly personal preference, but this dish was not quality by any means. I have not tried their other dishes, but this experience alone makes me never want to go back.",

Because they make it fresh for you while you wait and when you finally get to eat it, it doesn't taste like Chipotle or Qdoba - it tastes like something you can make at home, but spicy, even if you ask for mild! Even though there was lettuce, they don't just use it as filler, every ingredient is wonderfully proportioned and they don't skimp. I'll definitely eat from here again.",
