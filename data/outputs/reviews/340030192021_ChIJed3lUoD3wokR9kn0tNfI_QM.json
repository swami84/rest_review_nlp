Wish it came with a boiled egg but we easily add that ourself each time we order it. The lunch boxes are a fanatic deal and they offer a different discount box each day of the week. Everything is quite fresh and the food is very well packed. Delivery can be slow during lunch hours, I'm guessing they are quite busy during that time. We try learnt order earlier if we want to get our food by lunch.",

They came with regular soy sauce and gluten free/ wheat free/ 0 carb/ reduced sodium soy sauce which was nice for those that are on a diet. The cheese teokbokki was good too but a little too sweet in my opinion. Love that they just smother it in cheese! Prices were reasonable too. I ordered 2 rolls and the teokbokki for around $20. I do not recommend Grubhub though because they messed up and dropped off my food at a co-worker's house when we ordered together. I'm not sure if it was Grubhub or the restaurant but it took a reallly long time to get my food which ended up at someone else's house.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) The food is tidy and delicious, and it's a favorite restaurant these days. First of all, sushi combo is really delicious. Unlike other sushi restaurants, I think you are good at grooming fish and the quality is good. Bento sets are also good combinations, so you don't have to waste them. And gimbap! I've eaten all kinds of gimbap. Especially egg rolls are really delicious. The serving person is always kind and gentle.
