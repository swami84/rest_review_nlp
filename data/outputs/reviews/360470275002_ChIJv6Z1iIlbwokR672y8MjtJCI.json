The gumbo was a small bowl, 2 shrimps 2 sausage, 2 large unclean chicken breast in a soup of oil, no rice or seasoning. It costs ($20) i couldn\u2019t even eat it. The chicken was fried weird but I didn\u2019t eat it so i cant speak on it. The mac and cheese seemed cheap and smelled weird before taking two bites and giving up on it ($7). They even gave a side of vegan rice and black eye peas when i didn't ask for it (I'm allergic)Im confused on the reviews I'm seeing and i hope this is a one time thing but I won\u2019t be trying again.
