The only way i can describe the experience is: -Tortilla chips, swimming in sauce, with scrambled eggs on top and sprinkle of shredded chicken & cheese!  Let me tell you about the Carne en chile: First i asked, \"Chile Rojo or Verde, which one is the spicey one?\" The response from the only latino guy there was: \"Non of them are spicey...\"  FML!  I order the red one! It tasted really sweet. Not what i wanted at all..  *Furthermore, i order a michelada and usually they serve the glass with mix in it & the beer next to it. Another common one is: they pour the beer in the mich and set the left over beer next to the glass. What i got was a salty water down michelada. I don't even know if it had beer..\ud83d\ude22",

I ordered carnitas.  It was dried out little chunks of carnitas with no juicyness or flavor. The beans taste like canned refried beans and the garnishes are minimal. Tortillas aren't fresh. The rice was equally as pathetic. I would get better food from a whole in the wall and pay less.  My family ordered the chile relleno that was small and sad and just all around sad.  Again, super friendly staff and (very small) bag of chips and salsa are their only saving grace. Can't really call this Mexican food at all.",

Got on Google maps to find a new Mexican restaurant around the area I was running errands and came across this place. Let's just say I will be returning at least once a week!! By far the best Mexican food I have had on the island so far. They have great prices on lunch specials which is always a huge plus for me.  Staff was super friendly and my meal came out really quick. Ordered a beer and they brought out a frosty glass for it as well!~  If you like my review, please follow me and give me a \"like\"!",

The food is good, close to authentic food and service is great. Our server Felipe was always there when needed and very friendly. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars was because my husband ordered ceviche and it tasted like it had more ketchup in the ceviche than anything else but other than that, everything was great! Next time I visit Hawaii, I'll make sure to stop by again.",

Service has always been good here and they have a pretty extensive menu, including alcohol. Prices are average. First round of chips and salad are complimentary. I like their homemade chips and salsa, the salsa isn't too spicy but has good flavor.  If you're not sure what to get, get a combo plate so you can try a couple different things. I like their enchiladas and their tamal was very flavorful. Their red sauce was also mild enough for me. My burrito in the combo was about half the size of the Super Chaparros burrito. Their Super Chaparros burrito is huge btw.  Their burritos are really good, especially wet! Remember to make sure you get it wet!",

Plasticky cheese, a bloated menu where everything is done but nothing really done well, a dusty and unkempt front of house (thick coating on railings, pi\u00f1atas, everywhere...), and an overabundance of sauce everywhere to cover a multitude of sins against Mexican food of all regions. The sad chile relleno was flat, old, and covered in cheese that stuck to the plate. Tortillas tasted and looked purchased.  The only standout has been the well-seasoned, tender meat in the carnitas (forget the wasteland of beans and rice).  What started as a mom and pop shop making home-cooked food has unfortunately degenerated into a tired spot in need of inspiration, a deep cleaning, and a severe menu pare-down.  Sweet but slow and occasionally forgetful customer service.  Terrible parking lot with little on street parking on Beretania as an alternative.",

The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable. I accepted that the extra chips and salsa cost extra, because the first serving was free.  It was way more expensive than I like for these things (1 drink, 1 extra chips and my ala carte beans and single enchilada for about $15.00 not including tip), but like I said, I got my mexican food fix.

I came here hungry after a long swim practice. Lucky I swam so much because chips and salsa automatically arrive at the table and the \"Super Chaparros Burrito\" is the size of a small child.  I love Mexican food and, for the most part, thought my food was great. The tortilla chips they make were delicious, however, the salsa that came with them was disappointing. Their homemade was watery and not spicy at all. Since they make the salsa fresh themselves, it is possible that this was a single, poorly-made batch. The burrito and fish taco tasted excellent, though the salsa served was the same one that I didn't like coupled with a salsa verde that also wasn't particularly spicy.  I would have given 5 stars if the food was a tiny bit better. It is hard to please everybody, but the mammoth burrito could have used a really spicy salsa to go with it and I do not think this would be too difficult for the kitchen to offer, especially at a place like this. Come here during lunch for delicious $4.50 tacos or for drink specials during happy hour on Tuesdays.",

The plate also comes with a choice of traditional rice and beans or a salad.

When my nephew wanted chicken tacos for dinner, we were a bit hesitant to get Mexican food in Hawaii. I am so glad that we found this place on Yelp; the food was delicious! I ordered the Super Chaparros Burrito which had pretty much everything in it and shredded beef (but you can choose from a variety of meats like ground beef, shredded chicken, shrimp, fish, etc.). I opted to get my burrito wet with green sauce and it was so good! The green sauce was pretty spicy (or at least I believe most people would find it spicy - I really like spicy food) but it wasn't super sour like a lot of other green sauces I've had before.  I got a michelada because it was one of their drink specials for Wednesday. You have your choice of beer selection for the michelada, and I opted to do my favorite, Dos Equis. It seemed like the michelada mix was kind of store bought, but it was palatable and still equally delicious. They had other specials that day as well like a lilikoi, passion fruit, margarita. I didn't have the chance to try this one but I will be sure to try it on my next visit.  The location of the place is a little on the sketchy side, but it's well worth the visit. It is quite a small location and they don't seem to have the largest staff so it can be a small wait for your food to come out, but the staff here are extremely friendly and courteous and the quality and taste of the food is definitely worth the wait.  One thing to note is that parking here is extremely limited, - there are about six parking spaces and there is only one entrance so you might find yourself in a tight parking situation. It's about a 50 minute walk from Waikiki, if you're staying at one of the numerous resorts here, so you might want to Lyft or Uber or be prepared to drive there yourself.",

They have awesome margaritas and yummy desserts too - what more could you ask for?! If you're really hungry, try the Super Chaparros burrito which is monstrous and will definitely fill you up. The salsa that comes with the chips they serve is delicious and my favorite margarita is the blended Lilikoi one! Yes, parking can be a pain here and sometimes you have to wait, but it is always worth it! Everyone is so friendly that they make your dining experience truly enjoyable while you are there :)",
