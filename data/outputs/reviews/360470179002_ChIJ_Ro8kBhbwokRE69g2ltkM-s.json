Now about the Nursing Home itself,  The administrators and the employees there are wonderful to the residents, they treat them like an extension of their own families. The residents are every happy and cared for and do not seems to complain about much. I myself had the pleasure of meeting a lot of the staff there, the Administrators, Supervisors, Dietary, Nursing, Recreation, Housekeepers, and Maintenance.  All these departments keep the his place running in tiptop shape, from cleanliness to food service. They have a GREAT staff in Dietary department, THANK YOU to ALL of you.

The care is very poor and the place is more of a nut  institution then a rehab nursing home. They have 5 beds in a room and no bathroom. My mom was using the outside bathroom. The staff have attitude. They don\u2019t care much for the  patient. The place is old and disgusting. Please don\u2019t put  your loved one in this place. If It was up to me I\u2019ll give it NO star not even one.",
