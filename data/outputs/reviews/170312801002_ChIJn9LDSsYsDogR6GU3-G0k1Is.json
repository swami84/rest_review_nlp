The fries were good and big, but there was nothing spectacular about it. The  mayo dipping sauce that comes with it didn't add much. I also ordered the red spicy sauce, but it wasn't too spicy. It tasted like spaghetti marinara sauce. I ordered the large and was only able to eat half of it despite my large appetite.",
