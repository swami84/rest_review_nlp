So I said I already paid online and I logged into my bank account and noticed that they already charged me however the forced me to pay again. So I had to call my bank on the way out of the restaurant to report that it was double charged. Once I got home however I found out that my order was wrong as they included things in my rice that I didn't ask for. So be warned of this place the other reviews may trick you but the service is awful.",

Opened up the pork strips they are dry and dark meat with loads of fat, low mein is barely edible and the beef chow yoke is barely even marginal at best in tenderness and taste. They did however give us a free order of chicken in some type of sauce with no label or information other than \"free\" written on the container.. My 80 yr old mother tried the\"free\" chicken.... it was full of hot red chili pepper sauce.... she suffered for almost 10 minutes till the heat ebbed away...... 37 DOLLARS WENT DIRECTLY INTO THE TRASH CAN I have to say that they ARE TERRIBLE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO NO ONE.",
