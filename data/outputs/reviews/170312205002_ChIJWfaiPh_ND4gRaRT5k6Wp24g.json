Each dish had very unique touches, which highlighted the quality, thought and love that went into creating them! The grilled octopus was perfectly cooked, tender, crunchy suction cups, with its simple flavor truly shining. I loved the dollop of caviar and the choice of vegetables in the Mezze collection. Each of the dips were unexpectedly dynamic in flavor, and the lamb/chicken kabobs were super savory. The pita bread was the best I've ever eaten, very light and almost fluffy. The feta cheese bake with the sweet, juicy cherry tomatoes! \ud83e\udd2f and the bread with sesame seeds! Can you say, \u201ccomfort food?\u201d We ended the evening with this delicious dessert, Chocolate Halva Mousse. I\u2019m not going to lie, if you were unaware, you might think it was refried beans topped with shredded chicken and queso fresco, but it was a super unique twist on a very familiar dessert, the star of the dish being the cotton candy-like element and sesame praline.

The ambiance is great- the lush greenery around the restaurant and very cool mirrors that give an arch effect on the back wall give that Mediterranean vibe. Food was delightful!! I indulged in a  variety of dips, warm pita, grilled octopus and a wonderful sparkling white wine Assyrtiko that tied it all together!!!!!!! Their halva mousse, vanilla soufra and Greek cookies were the perfect end to a wonderful experience !!! 5 stars !!!",
