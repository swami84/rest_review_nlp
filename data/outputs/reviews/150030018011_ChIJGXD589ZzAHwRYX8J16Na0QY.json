Chicken was warm, maybe this is normal but I don't understand warm chicken on a cold salad. And the lettuce wasn't even cut up, why should I do your job and chop my own salad? The service was very lackluster, like they didn't want me to be there. So disappointed when there are so many better places I could have spent 18 dollars!",
