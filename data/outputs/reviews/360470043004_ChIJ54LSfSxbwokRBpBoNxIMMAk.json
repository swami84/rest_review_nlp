Also must say that we are extremely patient people. We arrived around 11:30 and sat on the back patio. At the time we arrived, only 3 other tables were filled. We received our beverages but after about an hour our food was not yet brought out. Other tables who sat after us received their food as well. Finally a waitress came over after passing us by time and time again and said the food would be next. Still after that other tables got their food and after 1 hour and twenty minutes we still did not receive our food and tried to leave. I\u2019m just disappointed that no one came out or even paid attention to us sitting there for that long without food. I love court street grocers but I will never come to hihi again.",

Sliders: crispy griddled beef, american cheese, sweetness of chopped grill onions, pickle on a potato bun - its a much much better version of the classic white castle slider.  However, one thing, they should slap some of that ridiculously good Hi HI sauce on it (sauce that comes from the fried chicken).  Fried chicken was flawless: partially boned thighs, crispy skin, nice brined taste, not greasy, awesome.  Don't forget the fine and flaky, buttery biscuits.  Makes me want to be Earl in the movie Diner, the guy who ate the entire left side of the menu.....",

I came here because I had read it was opened by the same people who own Court Street Grocers, my favorite sandwich spot in NYC, and boy it did not disappoint. It has a funky hip vibe, well lit with light wood and green leather chairs and booths, a sculpture of a whale fighting a kraken on a wall, you know, the staples.  The pea soup was great, not too thick with a nice texture created by a good scattering of ingredients: bacon bits, burrata, other stuff I'm not subtle enough to identify.\u00a0 Then I had the muffaletta, and oh my god delicious. The last muffaletta I had was in New Orleans and this gives it a run for its money - fluffy thick bread, stack of meats that makes a muffaletta, and wow the olive and sauce situation was a perfect complement.  The staff were friendly and attentive, I had a great time.  Definitely recommend!",

It's winter as I write this but excited to see what they do with the space, was great when previous restaurants occupied this space.  Cons - Really loud. Hopefully, they might end up fixing this with acoustic tiles or something. Kind of a good problem for them to have, I don't think previous restaurants ever had this many people in them. - A little pricey. I would say it's a little pricey but they are elevating things like the burger, it's not just a regular burger so it seems fair.

It's always a win when people who running successful businesses in the neighborhood open more!  We popped in for lunch and enjoyed our burger and the Jonah crab salad (the avocado was mottled in an unappetizing manner, but I cut those bits off). The staff was really nice and it's good to see them doing a brisk daytime business. I had a peek at the dinner menu and will definitely be in to work my way through that. Most exciting is that it's open for breakfast which is a very welcome addition to this part of Boerum Hill.",
