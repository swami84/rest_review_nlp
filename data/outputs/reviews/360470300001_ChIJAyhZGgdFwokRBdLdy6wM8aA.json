Honestly the food was pretty average and very annoying to eat. $78 dollars for a hot pot of crab, shrimp,and chicken. While it was big, the majority of the chicken pieces were bone and fat/skin. The crab doesn't have a lot meat in it but they still included the top shell (which were already separated from the body) why give us more things we can't digest? In times of COVID, we weren't even offered some sanitizing wipes/ or even hand sanitizer considering we had to touch our food all over with our hands. We weren't given a utensil to break the crab shell until 20 minutes after we were eating (The workers were completely out of sight). The shrimp/prawns had not even been divined. It was just a huge inconvenience to eat every item in the dish.",

Whenever we go, we always get family style so my review will be based off of those dishes. The Phoenix Wrap with chicken is the best, the others are mediocre. I love the lotus root with fish paste on it. Never too salty, lotus root nice and crunchy. The chicken and crab hotpot is flavorful, filled with chicken, crab, and shrimp. Most of the stuff have already been stir fried before so take it out quickly for the most tender meat. Get it with noodles and vegetables (+10 each but large portions). Ask for refills whenever it\u2019s out. The large intestine is amazing \u2014 our favorite out of most Chinese restaurants. Crispy and sweet. It\u2019s also my grandpa and grandma\u2019s favorite and we went here so many times. Tons of memory with them, and I guess it\u2019s especially since he passed away recently. I recommend, though I know the quality can be spotty.",

Fish bladders are crunchy, streamed pork belly with shrimp paste are tasty with automatic southern China flavor. Steamed white eel is done in the right time that is neither raw nor over cooked. Our only dissatisfaction came from the fried milk - it taste a little weird, might be deep fried in the oil that used to cooked other food before. Overall it's a good place to go.",

The braised duck and braised squabs were not impressive.  May have tasted better if the cooking method/technique used was different.  The squabs look like they were pre-marinated and then flash fried.  The most disappointing was the sliced fish with tofu and parsley soup.  The soup tasted off, smell weird, and tofu was lukewarm.  I had such soup elsewhere and know how it is supposed to taste and this was lacking in every way.  Lastly, I hope they change or replace some of the chairs.  A few of the chairs at our table either had cracks on the wooden boards (and not by design intention) or was shaky.",

This restaurant has the worse customer service I have ever encountered. This confirms all the previous reviews below. Our family of 6 stopped by at 1AM for a late night dinner. The waitress (small skinny 50 year old lady with glasses) was so RUDE. She was rushing us and forgot to write an order down. When we corrected her she snapped back at us saying it was our fault. We ordered too much. So basically we ordered too much for her poor brain to comprehend. What kind of waitress is that?! She was so pissy that she smacked the menu in MY FACE. Our uncle told her that she was rude and they started arguing. The other waiter chilling in back told us to leave immediately that he doesn't want our business. He even raised a CHAIR to my uncle. This is service based industry. How can they hire these bunch of idiots to run this stupid restaurant. No matter how good their food is, how can anyone swallow this?!!",

I told my friend I wanted to pay with my credit card so they can give me the cash, and the waitress overheard what I said. She said no cc. I was like \"hmm... ok np\". This is the part where a 2 star rating became 1. The waitress count the money in front of me and my friend. I was like really.. is this happening. This is the first time ever a waitress count the money in front of me. I should have ask for my tip back.  Will not recommend, and will not come again.",
