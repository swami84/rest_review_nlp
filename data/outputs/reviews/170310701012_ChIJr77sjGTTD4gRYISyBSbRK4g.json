He said he\u2019d rather lose $50 than serve bad pizza. He figures he\u2019ll make the money back eventually through sales.  I\u2019ve had several conversations with him. He has a standard for ingredients and service that he will never compromise. Principles taught to him by his father who was a restaurant owner all of Max\u2019s life. You can actually see his dad sitting in the back sometimes when you come in.  Max was very open about how he runs his business. I liked that. It created trust. He\u2019s been in business for over 20 yrs in over 4 different states. I really like NY pizza so I\u2019m glad he decided to open up shop in Chicago. Pay them a visit and decide for yourself.",
