When I opened up the paper with the doubles I saw a hair at the top ,but when I pulled it's not only at the top its was kneaded in the Bara ,literally in the flour . It was disgusting.  When I called to complain I asked for someone I charge they said they were not there at the moment . Instead of apologizing the girl went ahead to say that it is human mistake . If you guys were wearing a hair net that would never be a problem.  I could understand if it was just on top of the doubles but it is kneaded inside of the Bara.  They literally fried this inside .",
