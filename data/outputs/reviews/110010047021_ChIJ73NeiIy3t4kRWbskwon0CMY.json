I honestly couldn\u2019t fault any of the courses. Starting with the complementary Cig kofte to the first course; Hummus, Second Course; Patates Kofta, Adana Kebab for my main and the yum Baklava for dessert. Everything was in GOOD taste! I was also served tea and coffee free of charge after dinner. That\u2019s the Turkish way, perfect! First time here and I shall definitely revisit.

I called to make sure they'd be able to accommodate us, and they were extremely helpful and welcoming. The decor was clean and elegant. They have a great and affordable prix fixe menu, but many of our friends opted to order single entrees. The food came out quickly, and everything was delicious. My friends have a wide variety of dietary restrictions, but the menu had something for everyone! When my friends and I arrived, everyone was attentive and diligent about getting all of our food and drink orders correct (which they did), and was even able to divide the check per person! Our main waiter was Furkan, and he was so kind and hospitable, but the entire staff made sure I had a lovely birthday evening. Every one of my friends agreed the food, drinks, and service were excellent. Will definitely be back!",

Service here is absolutely appalling and I really want this restaurant to succeed given the quality of the food. We sat down and decided on the all you can eat experience which is $22 per person  Our waitress came by after about 20 minutes of us sitting there with only glasses of water. We finally thought she was about to take our order but she told us that she would \"choose for us\". \ud83d\ude12 After another 20 minute wait various spreads and starters appeared without regard to dietary restrictions of some of the members of the table. This meant that some of the options could not be eaten by members of the party. It is also near impossible to enjoy muhammara, labneh and other spreads without pita bread. We finally received more pita bread after asking for it 3 or more times after a 1.5 hour wait.  Looking around the restaurant we were also not the only ones in utter disbelief at the lack of service and also lack of food coming out of the kitchen. The waiting staff was also very inattentive to basic serving etiquette such as clearing the numerous small plates and even in one instance started bring out new small plates they were stacking on old used plates. Also several times our water glass remained unfilled despite specifically asking for water.  I would not recommend going to this restaurant until they figure out their staffing and kitchen and also train their staff to have basic waitering skills.",

I am normally not a fan of meza (small plates) which make up half the menu, but Ottoman Taverna succeeds in packing a huge diversity of flavors into well portioned dishes. The dishes are authentic but with enough variety to have something for picky eaters and/or foodies. The dishes are also big enough that you dont feel cheated on the price, but still small enough that you can order a few without overstuffing yourself. The service was also of a much higher quality that the pricing would suggest. Overall, a stellar experience and I plan to return soon.",

The lamb chops, vegetables, and eggplant puree was one of the better dishes I have had recently. The moussaka was good but nothing to write home about.  Bread was a nice balance between doughy and a touch crispy which was a pleasant surprise.  Service was solid for the most part.  The restaurant itself is absolutely stunning. From the lighting to the details on the movable walls, everything looked great.  A good mix of small tables and bigger ones for large groups.  Only thing is during the winter, don't sit next to the windows if you get cold easily.  After eating here I was shocked that it was only half full around 6 pm on a weekday; the food is that good.  Ottoman Taverna will be high on my list any time I am downtown.",

We were able to get a private room and it came with incredible service from long before to the event through the lunch itself.  The staff there was outstanding and responsive in setting up our lunch, working on a menu with us, and meeting any demand and concern.  My only regret from the lunch was only getting a few pictures of a couple appetizer items and not of all of the food that was coming out--which overwhelmed the entire group by the end.  It was a decadent experience and so much for what we paid for it.  Even in the actual moment where we had forgotten about a family member's food allergies, which had become more expansive, the staff immediately accommodated her and brought her items without tree nuts and other things that would cause her issues, allowing her to participate fully and enjoy everything that everyone else was.  The food itself seemed to never stop coming out and with our group of nearly thirty people, I cannot recall a single cup managing to be emptied all the way.  I have long been a fan of the food at this restaurant, which is not only tasty because of the ingredients and recipe, but because of the high skill level of the chefs.  Even on our first trip, a chicken breast kabob was tender and juicy--cooked, but dried out.  I have found everything at this restaurant to be uniformly well prepared with significant attention to detail.  We will continue to frequent this place and use it for special events when we have them and I highly recommend Ottoman Taverna to you for both as well.",

Both ordered from the pre-fixe menu and were honestly a little too blown away to remember pictures of the first two courses. The humus was creamy and mild, the grape leaves were perfectly flavorful. Kibbeh and falafel both served with sauces that were perfect compliments and cooked to provide a great crisp on the outside. The kebab and bulgar were divine. The green pepper was a great side addition. Salmon could not have been cooked better. The potatoes were a touch saltier than my liking but still amazing. Pistachio ice cream is the best we\u2019ve ever had and the rice pudding with cinnamon was also delicious. Turkish coffee was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. Service was also outstanding and the decor is comfortable but beautiful.",

Let me start with the rice served with the Char-grilled beef kofta. The rice was not fresh, it was dried out and chewy, my guess is that it was the left-over rice from a day or so. The butter they served in the beginning also had bad aroma resulting from sitting in the fridge for too long. Lahmacun served was not fresh out from the oven, rather it was microwaved. Imagine you go to an Italian restaurant and they microwave your pizza! You could see the lemon served with Lahmacun was contaminated, the small bag it was in was smelly and red in color. The tomatoes on the side did not also seem fresh. The Gozleme I ordered was with potatoes and you could see the potatoes were also not fresh, visually dried. On top of that, it had too much hot pepper in it and not mentioned in the menu. The drink I had was also contaminated, the glass smelled onion. The only thing nice about this restaurant was the staff. They were kind and friendly. Other than this, for a main course I paid 21 dollars and I must admit I had never experienced such bad experience in terms of food quality, freshness and contamination.",

I\u2019m used to the bartender telling you $10 for the drink and that\u2019s what you pay.  Anyway, I purchased the same drinks twice from two different bartenders (Yani being the first, but didn\u2019t get the second bartender\u2019s name), and paid different prices. Why, you ask? One included gratuity, the other did not. And it was just me and a friend, not a party of 4 or more.  A gratuity amount should not be forced on you, for several reasons. First, you may have provided crappy service and the patron didn\u2019t want to leave a tip, or felt the need to leave a less than desirable tip; Second, you may have provided amazing service and the patron wanted to give you a wonderful tip.  I asked the second bartender why the difference in price. He indicated his amount was more because it was after midnight. I showed him the receipt of my first round of drinks, which were purchased after midnight. He then try to cover and say the cash register\u2019s time was off and he didn\u2019t understand why I was questioning him. That attitude was enough for me to not venture here again.  I\u2019ll stick with the parties and bars that charge you $10 for a $10 drink.",
