Our server was great and you get they start you off with a complimentary basket of their crab seasoning chips which were very good. The nachos were good but not too much wrong that you can do to nachos, wish I would have ordered other food options but wasn\u2019t that hungry. Overall it was a really good experience.",

Plenty of people working and not many customers.  I ordered a beer and they said it would be a minute as they had to retap it. Fast forward 25 minutes and still no beer. I finally just asked for something else as they seemed as if they couldn\u2019t care less.  We got  our food and it was wrong. The bar tender just shrugged it off and said they\u2019ve been making mistakes back there all day. I decided to just go with it and get the hell out of there. They still charged us for what we didn\u2019t get but again I didn\u2019t want to spend another minute in there so I paid it and left. The manager was there the whole time too, what a joke.",

About 40 minutes in I went to check and see where we were on the list and they told me that they were no longer allowed to use the text message system and that they had already called R name at the front door. I said but we were in the bar and she said the manager told her not to go in the bar. They eventually found us a table and the air conditioning was not working and there are no ceiling fans in the main dining Room. Once we were seated our server was actually fantastic and got our food and drinks very quickly. The food itself was very good. But there were no sides and I'm not sure if there were supposed to be or not at that point we were going to be late for the game.  I am not sure if it is always like this however was very disappointing when we were told that a manager decided not to make sure that we could hear our name be called and not to use the text message system.

When we mentioned it to the waitress she offered to send the chef out so we could tell him.  He never came out and they didnt offer to replace them or remove from bill. Sorry Dempsey we're done.",

We decided to stay anyway and order off the menu. My husband ordered the cheese steak sandwich. He's pretty sure they used cheese whiz for the sandwich. The vegetables were undercooked and they served what looked like a pickle on the side but is actually a cucumber. I ordered honey mustard with my chicken and it didn't come out until the end of the meal. The waitress wasn't friendly, maybe having a bad day but it made the overall experience kind of suck. Overpriced and overrated. Do not recommend.",

Although there were almost no tables taken, our host walked us past a lot of good tables and sat us right next to the kitchen, which we quickly realized was the worst table in the building. the constant rush of servers and busboys created a draft, and we asked to be relocated. They moved us to a table two spots up. The table was disgusting, not cleaned, to the point where I put a few napkins down over the top. I ordered their house burger, and my wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich, with a house salad with ranch instead of coleslaw. Pretty simple, right? After a moderate wait, our order arrived, to my wife's disappointment. They brought her a pulled pork sandwich with no bun, and a salad with no ranch. They also brought her the coleslaw she hates, and no house chips, which come with every sandwich. The server apologized and fixed the screw-up, but we were one of only two parties in his section at the time. The menu also says the chips are old bay flavored, but the chips we got were plain. The only reason why this place gets two stars instead of one is the burger was pretty good and my wife says the pulled pork wasn't bad, after she got her bun. The pricing was what I expected from a bar and grill located inside of a ballpark. Will not return.",

Then, he put other table's orders in under our table number, so every few minutes a food server would show up and try to give us somebody else's food.

Cool pictures, nice people and great food with view of Camden Yards. First class treatment. Thanks",

No napkins, utensils, or water were provided. The server came out with our food and called our burger a crab cake... Wuuuuuut. And then he seemed really upset when I questioned him. He turned his back to us and started watching tv for a full two minutes before dragging his knuckles back to the kitchen. I'm questioning my rating of two stars at this moment. Maybe one is more appropriate. Our waitress was very nice, to be fair, but it also seemed like she may have been on a staycation on Mars courtesy of Mary Jane & Company. We could have just been really unlucky, but I don't think I would come back here given the opportunity. There are waaaaay better options within walking distance and something called the Charm City Circulator. Price-wise, also not worth it. You could get an equivalent meal for 50% or less. Bottom line... Don't \"eat\" here.",

I saw they had a happy hour so I decided to get my group that I was traveling with to come back in the afternoon.  It was a non game day so there may have been 20 customers in the whole place.  We were seated outside and basically our server never came to our table after about 15 minutes.  The manager actually took our drink order and then disappeared.  The server showed up about 5 minutes later to take our drink order even though the manager already took it.  I could really go on about how bad the service was.  When we finally got our drinks one was wrong but we did not complain.  On the next order we asked for a glass and the server never came back.  I had to go inside and get a glass from the bar.  The food was pretty good except for a couple of chicken wings that were under cooked.  I was really excited about this place because of the atmosphere but had to apologize to my group for making the suggestion to eat here.  I am not sure how this place could even operate if it was a game day.  Maybe the A-team is not there on non game days.  Very disappointing.",

They took it back to the kitchen and just threw some pineapple and sauce on it. When it came back out, it still had no cheese or bacon. The waitress came by and took it back. By the time they remade it for me, both of my friends had finished eating. It was also well done when I asked for medium.  When the checks came, my buddy had a $10 off card. She brought the checks and forgot to apply the $10 card so she had to redo the checks.  The only pro was the beer brewed onsite and the O's game.",

This restaurant has a breathtaking view of the field, and the architecture is a thing of beauty! The service is always outstanding, and the bathrooms are always clean! Plus, there is validated parking! Try the happy hour especially when the team is out of town and a great place to watch a road game. Love it! We recently had a social for our professional group and let's just say it was a hit! We ended up selling tickets in a block for the upcoming Yankees game with great seats outside of Dempsey's. My favorites are the sweet potato tots, the Old Bay fries, the fish tacos, burgers, wings, pizza and the pulled pork! Yep I have hit the menu!
