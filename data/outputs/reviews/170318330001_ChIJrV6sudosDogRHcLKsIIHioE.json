Great atmosphere, fabulous food, and the scene is always hoppin!  (literally \"bumped\" into Jud Nelson once leaving my table, who was sitting at the bar)  If you want your night to be EXTRA special, try to reserve the private \"Balcony\" table a few weeks in advance.  My girlfriend surprised me with this treat one year and it was top notch.",
