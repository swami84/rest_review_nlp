Having worked in the service industry for over a decade I\u2019m usually the first to give a pass for a miss if service is a bit off or slow, but this particular experience was atrocious. After being seated, we were ignored for over 15 minutes with no greeting. When we finally signaled our server over, we gave both drink and meal orders, and once drinks were dropped off, didn\u2019t see our server again until the end of the meal. No check in\u2019s, no \u201chow\u2019s everything?\u201d, and had to ask the food runner for salt and pepper to season the completely bland food. One of our drinks was incorrectly ordered, and were brought the correct item, only to discover we were charged for both on the final bill (and didn\u2019t have the energy to try and chase down the MIA server and request it taken off the bill). I\u2019m short, will never patronize this place again, and do not recommend.",

The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because we got bad service during brunch. I know it's COVID, rules are constantly changing, and staffing appropriately for the weather can be hard. We tried to do bottomless drinks but struggled to get refilled and constantly had to do that thing where you stare every server down until someone acknowledges you #awkward. We ended up paying the bottomless price for only 2 mimosas. The waitress seemed annoyed with us when we asked for our check without getting another refill but we were done eating and didn't want to take up the outdoor space since seating is limited. Would still recommend it, but would NOT recommend this place as a 'bottomless brunch' spot.",

Atmosphere & ambiance: We sat out back in the beer garden, the tables were all a good distance from people (social distancing) and there were a lot of nice trees, plants, and ivy dressing up the back patio. We were there from around 430-620pm, they were kind of busy when we arrived but less busy when we left. We were seated immediately (they did have optional indoor streetside seating) and service was very good despite how many people were dinning. You can bring your dog! There were two couples with friendly dogs that just lay under the table. <3 The music was some fun remixes of popular songs. The music was pretty loud, and when busy the surrounding peoples conversations were pretty loud. (Maybe because of the delicious drinks) I could still hear my partner speak and it was easy to converse, but I could also hear others conversations and it was a pretty loud atmosphere. Nothing like a noisy bar where you have to yell, but if you're looking for a calm quiet place to have a serious conversation this isn't the place.  Drinks: They had a decent variety of selections and flavors. We ordered the cucumber mojito, blueberry mule, and the cherry blossom margarita. The mojito was delicious! I couldn't taste much of the cucumber but it was still super yummy. The blueberry mule was also delicious and it came with a cute rubber duck. Of course they served it in a copper cup! The cherry blossom margarita was super delicious! Very flavorful! If you're looking for deliciously flavored drinks this is the place. They also use paper straws!!  Food: We ordered the nachos from the appetizer porion of the menu. We hadn't eaten all day and were starving! The nacho platter was huge, it fed both me and my friend and we were satisfied and full afterwards. The nachos were delicious! There was no skimping on toppings! We didn't have one chip that we couldn't cover with tasty toppings. The nachos has a TON of cheese, a very thick layer of melty shredded cheese. We got the medium rare steak on our nachos (you can get vegetarian, chicken, shrimp, steak, or something else I forget.) The steak was so juicy and delicious, there was just a little bit of seasoning on the steak. Like some salt pepper and maybe garlic powder or something - very light seasoning but the perfect amount, SO tasty!! The nacho plate could easily be a shared meal for two, or a nice sized app for 4 or 6 if you ordered two apps. An extra plus- I signed into the wifi with my email and received a coupon for a free app next time I come!  Overall: I will definitely be back! I loved it! The food was great, along with the service and drinks!",

We got a few appetizers, the breadsticks which were so fluffy and yummy, the fries (so crispy, I loved them) and the tatter tots nachos, which I am dreaming to get again!  Also got a few pizzas to share, Margheritta, Prosciutto and Arugula and the Lark Lemon. The Lark Lemon pizza was a game changer, I just need it again and again and again. SO GOOD!  Drinks omg, sooooo refreshing! I definitely need to go back to try some more of those cocktails!  Not only yummy food and drinks, a pretty patio... Prices are also really good! I will definitely be back very soon!",

What this place does well. Great service and friendly staff. They are also being really good about following guidelines for COVID-19. They have a large patio out back with plenty of umbrellas to protect you from the sun. The food comes out quickly. The drinks are great. They also have an all you can drink brunch mimosa special on Saturday and Sunday.  It is a great place to have a LGBTQ meet up or casual meal.",

Unfortunately shortly later my husband realized he had food poisoning from the salmon he had.  Things happen so we decided to give it another shot.  Next time we stopped for drinks and appetizers before a show.  The service was slow and we ended up having to cancel part of our order because it was taking so long and we were going to be late for the show.  I guess we don\u2019t learn our lesson because today we decided to order take out since they had something we were craving.  When our order arrived we were missing two items.  I called to let them know and after waiting on hold and being passed around 3 times I was told there was nothing they could do and that we needed to call Grubhub. When we finally sat down to eat the items we did receive all lacked flavor and were not worth the price.   Needless to say we won\u2019t be back.",

We ordered at 6:40. We waited and hour called back 7:40 we where told they where going to send it out we then called at 8:00 and they had thought we order for pick up even though we clearly gave our address. We called back at 8:50 and still our food was not even made. We spent all evening waiting and ended with up no food. We are so disappointed and hungry.

Took forever for us to get a waiter to come order drinks, to the point we waited 30 minutes and then another 15 for the drinks to get there. At that point in a brunch you should be on your third drink. Drinks then took forever to get there and the bloody mary frankly was not mixed. Spice not blended and when settled assaulted your mouth. Music was too loud to hear each other. Vibe is VERY cute and the decorations are fun but they can't save a bad meal.",

Even if you have Celiac disease. They are absolutely to die for.  Pizzas are always good, but I tend to order either salmon or the steak frites. The salmon is always wonderfully fresh and well prepared, and always served on top of delicious seasonal vegetables with either a great balsamic reduction or a fresh, delicious pesto sauce. The steak frites is always great too, and they're perfectly happy to sub out the frites for veggies (I'm not opposed to potatoes, but they're seasonal vegetables are just always excellent!)  Drinks are good and fairly priced. Nice selection of wines by the glass and bottle.  Oh, and the service! Always friendly! Always helpful!  This place is truly a gem.",

I only asked for a straw because I seen them sitting right by him behind the bar in the holder, he told me they no longer had straws... Feeling a bit confused, even thinking \"maybe he didn't understand what I meant\" , I asked the lady after she brought me my receipt (PLUS I TIPPED) for a straw, she says they don't have straws. Instead of making them both look foolish in front of all the people standing around, I took a deep breath, grabbed my drinks and left. It stayed heavy on my mind so I had to write a review; not to get even but to make it clear to management. If you're going to tell your employees to lie and say that you do not have straws, AT LEAST PUT THE STRAWS AWAY SO WE CAN'T SEE THEM. I can't stand being lied to ESPECIALLY when you just took my money for watered down drinks! AGAIN, PLUS I TIPPED! That was a very poor experience, I felt cheated.",

Nic was nice, but very inattentive. We ordered two pizzas and mac n cheese (after he recommended it). After the pizzas came out we still had to received the mac n cheese. A while went by and we finally asked about it. He apologized that he forgot. Then I asked for a side of ranch. He also forgot. We were planning on leaving soon so we got our check, but we ended up staying a few hours longer. Not once did he ask of we wanted to get another drink or anything else. Considering the place was not busy it was a huge turn off by his lack of service. Plus, he didn't take off the mac n cheese or offer any compensation to show he was sorry the wait was so long for the mac n cheese. Overall food is delicious, service leaves much to be desired. I won't be back.",

I ordered it medium-well and it was cooked perfectly. The flavor combination of the cilantro aioli, queso fresco and chorizo was absolutely delicious.  Enough about the food, on to the service. Upon waking in were were greeted by a smiling bartender and sat at our table by a friendly hostess. Our server, Alex, was top notch! He kept our waters filled, offered menu suggestions, and checked on the table frequently.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",
