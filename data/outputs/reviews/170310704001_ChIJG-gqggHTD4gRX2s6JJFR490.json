The manager surprised us an threw in a bottle of wine. It's easy to see why they have been in business for 70ish years.  Haven't eaten inside but it looked like a small and cozy indoors with good booths for a pizza date.  Will definitely come in person this summer.",

Open seven days a week in Lincoln Park, just a few blocks from the Diversey Brown or Purple line, it is upon entry to the storied space lined in black & white photos that guests are greeted, socially distanced seating demarcated with all staff appropriately donning PPE.  Known for Tavern Style Pizza, or \u201cThin Crust\u201d as Pat\u2019s lists it on the menu, diners are additionally offered an array of Appetizers and Entrees plus three sizes of \u201cChicago Pan Pizza,\u201d IE Deep Dish at about half the price of Lou\u2019s, Uno or Gino\u2019s.  Opting for the best of both worlds, the Pan taking longer to prepare and thus allowing adequate focus on each style hot from the oven, locals say one has not tasted a true \u201cCracker Crust\u201d until they visit Pat\u2019s, and far be it for this author to argue as the crisp base crackles to the tooth with pockets of air giving way to herbaceous Sauce, melted Cheese and crumbly but moist Fennel Sausage.  Apparently not the Restaurant\u2019s original location, though the same oven is still responsible for each and every Pie, Pat\u2019s deep dish comes extricated from its pan unlike other Chicago staples, and with Cheese better melted plus Crust richer with Butter the overall effect is a significant upgrade on more famous places without the tourists or lines.",

Now, while we were waiting for the pizza, I called Pats and started to tell the lady who answered that we are waiting for the delivery guy who is 30 minutes late, then suddenly I was put on hold. I waited for 5 minutes still on hold and hung up and called back again. When the lady heard my voice, she again put me on hold again, unbelievable! Finally the phone rang and was told by our front desk that the pizza finally arrived so I hung up.

We ended up getting just the bread and a large pizza, thin cracker crust, with half pepperoni and half sausage. To most, the \"tavern style\" pizza is traditionally a Chicago classic. The bread was a tasty appetizer and the pizza was excellent. To be honest, however, it was all about the crust of the pizza...not the toppings. There was nothing wrong with the pizza, but the toppings were the same as most any other pizza place in Chicago so it wasn't like this place was any more special than any other. However, the crust was so thin...and thats what this place does best.",

The baked goat cheese appetizer was also good. :) ----- Caution: Tonight, I was asked to pay ~$5 more than the total price listed on their website as \"we were dining in\". According to the waitress who was helping us, the dine-in & take-out prices in Pat's are different with dining in being more expensive!  Eventually and after I talked to them about the check, they threw in a $5 discount coupon, but that misses the point: I had never seen this issue in any restaurant, ever! Thinking of setting a price difference (and assuming it is legit), it should actually be the other way around; I can think of a million reasons why they should be encouraging people to dine in, by making it cheaper...  UPDATE (March 2019):  Don't get me wrong; the food here is superb! However, always make sure to triple-check the check against menu prices. Similar discrepancies to what I wrote before have happened to me here. I wish this was one of those places you can fully  trust in this regard.",

My mushroom fettuccine was buttery deliciousness with crispy asparagus and tender pork chunks. And on top of a delicious meal (which we will have again tomorrow) the server Cat was outstanding and so friendly.  One of the kitchen staff came out to talk to us too, cuz we're tourists from Florida and not locals, and they gave us an order of calamari to take home!  Amazing.

I know hot pizza is better, maybe next time?  As I said, I wasn't impressed by the taste, what really surprised me is the pizza size. This pizza is very thin. You might love thin pizza, I like thin pizza, but not this thin. The pizza crust here seems thinner than a saltine. The sauce seemed non existent and the cheese was pretty scarce as well. A big guy like me can eat this 16 inch pizza pretty easily. The thing is it'll cost you around 20 dollars. For that amount of money you can go get a steak or a more filling meal.  I'll prob go back to try the pasta though because the establishment looked nice. It seemed very clean and the staff seemed friendly.",

My favorites are the pork Milanese, an Italian-style breaded pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and buttery pork gravy (order extra gravy!) with grilled veggies and a salad. You always get a loaf of fresh-baked crusty bread. The pasta is OK, just not my favorites.",
