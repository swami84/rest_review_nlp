I ordered 2 eggs, toast and coffee with steamed soy milk. This place has outstandingly high prices for this hood and it should be redesigned as a grab and go but slashing their prices in half. Our bill was almost 40 dollars and i was still starving. My fruit bowl probably had 1 strawberry, 1/4 of a kiwi and 3 grapes cut into small pieces so it looked like it was more. You want a side, well thats about 4$ and its coming straight from the frozen section in a store. Quality was ok but not enough for the price and not the type of ambience for a sit down. You won't get refills on the terribly bitter coffee, so why have a  server? Again, this place could probably be successful in its current location if they changed this to a grab and go, order up front and take out and then slash prices in 1/2. then it would be worth it.",

        "caption": "I used to visit Caribella when it was under the name Cafe Bella. After the completed renovation, I found a brand-new menu with all-day breakfast and lunch available. Though I was sad that some of my old favorites were gone, the server told me management was the same, so I knew the food would be fresh and well-made like before.  My Cubano with Spanish rice was flavorful, and I like how pulled pork was included in the sandwich. The lunch portion was generous, so I had leftovers to take home. The server was friendly and good with his pacing.  Everything is made to order, so don't expect the fastest wait times, but know that the wait is worth it! Glad to have a small business like this in my neighborhood.",
