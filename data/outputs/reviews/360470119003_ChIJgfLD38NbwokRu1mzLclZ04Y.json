There are some obvious perks of GG that other reviews touch on (fantastic liquor selection, spacious backyard with good atmosphere and comfortable seating, friendly staff, and possibly the best fries you'll find in a bar), but I want to highlight their commitment to innovation.  Gowanus Gardens expands their menu almost weekly.  Two of my recent favorites are their new grilled cheese and the frozen sangria, but they have come out with so many hits this summer that I can barely keep track.  Besides menu innovations they have made many improvements to their backyard over the last year including the addition of long communal picnic tables and large umbrellas on case it rains. They were also quick to create an outside \"front yard\" during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has the added benefit of allowing dogs!  They do a great job showcasing new liquors, cocktails, or snacks on their instagram if that's your thing.  Excited to see what Gowanus Gardens comes out with next!",
