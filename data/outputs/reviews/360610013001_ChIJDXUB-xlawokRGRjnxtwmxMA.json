The taste was Okay, not even great, and there were atleast 4 shrimps \ud83d\ude20 and that for $25,- Be real ! (I know NYC is expensive, but this is rubbish)  In the beginning the waitress was friendly, but after serving the food, we did not see her, and never asked how it was or tasted.  Only go for the view ! Not for the food.",

I had the Salmone Marinato as an appetizer and it was really good, followed by the Spaghetti Alla Busara, which we also slot on. The shrimp were fresh and tender, and the spaghetti was cooked not to the very soft point, which I like. The service is quick and friendly and the have a nice wine list to go with the menu.",
