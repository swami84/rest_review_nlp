The rainbow roll was basically all rice with a sliver of fish on top, it was disappointing. The other roll was tasty, just a lot of rice!  Maybe an off night so want to give the benefit of the doubt...",

The Spider roll wasn\u2019t as crunchy as we\u2019ve had at other places and it was a little bland. The Crazy roll had a nice spicy kick to the end of the bite that made it worth it too.  And another nice touch is that they wrote the names on the box!! I LOVE this extra piece of thoughtfulness! Will definitely be back!",
