I did that and politely told the older man working there my name & I was there to pick up my food. He yelled at me we have no mustard! So I replied, that's fine. When he showed me the receipt he said there's no tuna. I looked at knowing I double checked my order before placing it and saw tuna.. Along with everything else I ordered.  He yelled at me again nd said he has a long line (the customer next me even said that wasn't true) and I should have gotten in line. I told him I was picking up & was told to bypass the line in my email from Subway. So finally he starts to give the lady next to me her food and she told him, take care of her she needs to get back to work. (I was in uniform wearing a suit at that) I get my food FINALLY... Get back to work and the tuna is in fact there but on the wrong sandwich. And the one the tuna was suppose to be on didn't have no meat. I know this was long but I don't recommend anyone go here & I will certainly NEVER BE BACK!",
