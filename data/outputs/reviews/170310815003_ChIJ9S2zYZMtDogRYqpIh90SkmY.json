While there was nothing wrong with the food.. it was just totally underwhelming. We were not at all impressed by the flavours- it was a little bit bland, and we seemed to get fatty cuts of lamb and chicken. The only stand out thing about this place was the price. Not worth it. Much better options out there.",
