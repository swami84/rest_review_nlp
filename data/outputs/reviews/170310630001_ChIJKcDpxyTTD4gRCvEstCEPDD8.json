All it came with was chicken and pickles, it was supposed to have coleslaw, cheese and some kind of creamy sauce none of which was on it. The fries were incredibly soggy and not at all seasoned. The ranch I paid 1.50 for was also super low quality. I really don\u2019t understand how you just totally neglect to add more than half the toppings to a sandwich?!  EDIT TO REVIEW:  They offered to bring me a new sandwich another day on the house. Great service and the sandwich with everything on it was excellent. Also tried the macaroni this time which I\u2019d highly recommend also.",

I had the tenders made zesty and had to try their comeback sauce. Reminded me of my visit to Nashville. The bread at the bottom absorbed ALLLL of that spicy grease, and was still butter grilled or toasted (not sure which). It was the cherry on top. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc 2.) The customer service, even after 1am. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffcI chose to have my order delivered by a 3rd party delivery service(my fault), and they failed me at every step. Not only was the employee who took my call regarding my orders status very kind and genuine, he offered to help me by contacting the 3rd party delivery to fix it how he could. Bravo!  Thoroughly impressed and will be eating from here again. Definitely dining in though.",
