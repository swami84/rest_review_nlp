However, after we ordered we noticed the man assembling the food was not wearing a mask. I mean.. not even an attempt made at putting one on.  It\u2019s such a simple thing to do, especially when in front of customers.  Next up, we got home and our order was completely wrong. We asked for 1 steak and 1 chicken taco, a chicken gordo burrito, and a chicken + steak aztec burrito. Both burritos had steak on them and both tacos were steak. The gordo burrito didn\u2019t have rice on it. All in all, not sure if the dude in the back wasn\u2019t having a good day but we were really disappointed in our experience.",
