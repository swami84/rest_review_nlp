They have an excellent selection of house-branded wine made out in LI, and other NYS wines as well as a few beers on tap too. The prices are reasonable and the wine is excellent! You can buy bottles to go, which is a nice touch. Carp\u00e9 Vino fills the wine bar hole this neighborhood has had for a few years now, and I\u2019m looking forward to becoming a regular here.",
