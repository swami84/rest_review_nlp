Despite the restaurant not being full, it took nearly an hour for our appetizer (a pitiful serving of calamari) to come out, and another 15 minutes thereafter for our entrees. A staff member assured us that the appetizers and entrees were going to come out together to minimize the time we had already waited, but this was clearly a lie. We also waited 10\u201315 minutes at the start for our drinks and clearly saw a large group of people at the bar being served their drinks before us. The burgers and sandwiches we ordered were not nearly satisfying enough to justify the high price, and one of the burgers that was ordered rare came much drier than expected. Shrimp risotto was good but was the exception to an otherwise poor execution of the whole meal. There was also burning smoke that started to fill the room a few minutes after we were seated, and the staff were not transparent at all about the source of the smoke. That likely contributed to the slower service in terms of food coming out on time, but that was not communicated clearly. I would not recommend this place in the future.",

My duck was both crispy and fall apart in my mouth, but the breast portion required a sharper knife than they gave me to cut the fat off of the edge. The environment is woody-heavy, with an interior section that appears like stained glass might in a warehouse district. Work and planning went into the ambiance and interior, but it's not cohesive and I'm not sure it works. They have board games, but they are missing pieces, and the addition of them muddles whatever vibe they are trying to create. Our server was friendly and informed, so no complaints there and the prices were standard for the quality and the area. I found their menu to be sadly small, but I reiterate, everything I ate was delicious - I have leftovers in my fridge I'll be eating today.",

Flatbread specials and oysters are a must have appetizer and anything on the menu is a treat.  Plus for dessert, they have boozy ice cream.
