Yes. The cheap kind you buy at Trader Joe\u2019s for 2 dollars a bag. I had never requested mixed greens, so I decided to confront the manager, who blatantly said they add the mixed greens to fill up the bowl. Terribly deceiving, and also dangerous, because if someone has an allergy, they will be eating items that weren\u2019t disclosed. He gave me a small bowl of rice to try to compensate, but none of the other ingredients. Needless to say I will not be coming back, and that I will be telling others not to come either. Sadly for them, since I am an avid poke bowl eater and this is on my commute, so I could\u2019ve been a frequent customer.",

After my BF turned around to let me know the cashier said a few more minutes he saw the cashier hand the order receipt to the cook through their little window and hysterically giggling with her coworker because she had forgotten to notify the cook about our order. My BF asked the cashier if the food was already being made and she said no. We told the cashier that we didn't want to wait because we were on a timed schedule and that we wanted a refund. My BF paid by card but she gave him cash back excluding the tip he had added when he paid. We had to ask for the tip money back because they definitely do not deserve a tip.  My friends couldn't finish their ramen especially since we had to leave so they asked for a lid for their ramen. The lid doesn't even fit the bowl!",
