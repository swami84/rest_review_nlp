We should have left when we were waiting to be seated & 2 servers looked at us and went in the back. ( No one was seated inside to eat yet). \"Told girl going home so no one to wait on us, outside\".  We were seated by a window view which was fine. Than we noticed there was a scent piped in that was overpowering  . Others were being seated outside. WTF?  So we asked to be moved & our waitress who was sweet did. We each got the NY Strip & added lobster. Mine was to be well & other was to be med well. Ordered Pepsi's & they tasted flat. Our steak, lobster, butter bowl asparagus arrived & it was not hot, not even warm . We had to wait for steak knives but we went to eat the lobster and dip in butter & It was like warm. Picked it up with our fingers & pulled it out of the shells.  We were to get mash potatoes & had to ask for them. Mashed with the skin but cold. Dug to the bottom thinking maybe hot? Nope! Not surprised. 3 servers waiting on 3 tables/ 6 people total. All asked of \" our food was good\"? I hate confrontations. I said \"it was okay\". My son ran inside to get me a napkin & wash hands. It seemed like servers kept disappearing. But figured maybe more guest arrived inside & busy? One server asked my son inside what was going on with our meals. He told her. The other 2 servers came out separately & basically cleaned table, asked \"if we wanted dessert\" or to go containers? I said \" no thank you , please we are ready for the bill. The server who wasn't ours but knew something was wrong. Asked to let her tell and we said \"no thank you\" just leaving. Everyone was nice . Usually tip 20- 25% but so disappointed tipped 15% on. We both feel badly. Just was looking forward to good surf & turf meals in Tampa . My son did mention pop was flat to our original server.  I thanked her & headed for the ramp quickly. I work hard for my money & enjoy buying decent meals for my family. I hate complaining about food because most restaurants  probably hear it daily & never know if they are being scammed or if they are really lacking?  I also hate sending food back to the kitchen. You all no why\ud83d\ude15. Again, 3 servers were all polite , nice they help each other. But when you spend $ 80.00 & leave most of your food ( 26.00 steaks & more than half). Hope this review helps you all improve?",

Conveniently located in the Channelside district, this setting not only provides amazing views of the convention center and waterfront, but the decor also has an air of profound classiness.  The prices aren't horrible considering the environment. Definitely planning on coming back with friends in tow when I launch my start-up. You definitely helps to live less than a few hundred yards away. May make this a normal stop for a Friday night dinner.",
