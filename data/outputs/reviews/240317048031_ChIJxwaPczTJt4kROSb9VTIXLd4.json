The young woman held on to my card for an extended period of time making a fuss over the register as if there was an error. As I waited, I inquired to my sister (whom I was speaking with via earphones) why the young woman had not given my card back yet as she dealt with the register. Finally, card returned, I signed for my meal and left. The following day, by 4:00 pm, I had over $350 in fraudulent purchases on my credit card. Luckily, my bank caught all of these purchases and all is well on my end. However, the Thai Kitchen was the only establishment where I had relinquished my card to someone for payment and, notably, that person held onto it for an extended period of time (under the circumstances). Since the fraud, I have attempted to speak with the manager or owner about the incident, both in-person and over the phone, and have been given the run around. If there is a security breach I wanted the business to know. I left my business card as well. But, I was met with resistance: No one will speak with me. I have been told that the manager's name is \"Manager\" and that the workers are unable to release his name.",

The pad thai actually tasted like pad thai.  The reason I give this one a 3 stars instead of 4 is because our order wasn't ready on time. We ordered through Doordash instead of their website, and I guess they don't check that source as often or something? The order was supposed to be done 5:58pm, we got there at 6pm but the order wasn't there. The lady did some checking and finally found the order about 5 minutes in. Told us it would be about 30 minutes. We went off to do some errands, came back, and the order was ready.  Will go again if in the craving for cheap Thai food, and will make sure to use the store's website.",

You have to spice them up a bit with the condiments they provide on the side but otherwise I come back for those dishes.  However, the stir fry I got recently was just awful. I got the Ku prow which is usually a standard beef option at similar Thai places.  It was like a very watery beef with basil and onions dish. I mean it was just bland and unappetizing. I had to drown it in soy sauce just to salvage it.  They really need to put some work into making this dish better or work on their quality control, because for now on I am not going to risk trying anything from the stir fry section.  Again  a good value restaurant that I think caters too much to the bland pallets of bougie elite people in the area. Might need more quality control.  Stick to the curry and noodles.",

The strong smell immediately made my husband's stomach upset so he took our 2 year old and waited outside while we packed up the remainder of our food in to-go boxes. It was really off putting and we all left feeling a bit queasy. They turned someone away who came in and wanted to place a to-go order 15 min before closing.

The cashier proceeded to come back to the counter, did not acknowledge me and proceeded to talk to a customer behind me in line and asked her if she was ready to order. I believe both myself and the customer behind me were shocked. The customer behind me proceeded to state I was waiting before her. The cashier did not apologize or offer a reason for overlooking. I addressed her about her lacking customer service and asked to speak with the owner. The owner indicated she was busy with cooking orders! Anyway, the  lemongrass soup was pretty good. So much for customer service...",

This is not meant as much of a sit down restaurant, only few 2 people tables and more cold feeling like ambience likely good for lunch for businesses around, but the food was delicious and staff friendly and helpful. This meant for more take out but delicious and fresh! Parking is right around the back in the open lot parking space. We will be sure to return for pick up, there are no Thai options in Bethesda other than the old Bethesda, you have to venture out to Rockville or Silver Spring. Recommend you give it a try for pick up and you would not regret. I\u2019m rooting for this place as I feel especially this part of Bethesda has lost much of its support for small businesses likely due to high rent. Enjoy!",

I think their setup is efficient, food is good, service is in line with this type of restaurant. However, when i tried to place an order over the phone, it was not possible. They don't have menu on a website or yelp. I called to ask and was told it is on facebook. However, it was a poor quality photo copy that is not readable. I was told to go in to place order and wait for it. Well, they are not that good for my taking too much time to do so. I actually ended up cooked my own delicious meal with my friend. They just lost 2 customers. We don't feel like to go back any time soon.",

The food was delicious, service was excellent, and prices extremely affordable for downtown Bethesda - pretty much any entree (including meat) is $10.  They even have the water cups and water tank out in the dining area, which is a huge plus in my book.  The only thing is that there are only about 8 or 10 tables, only a couple of which were four-tops (though most of the remaining two-tops can also be converted to four-tops), so I can imagine that it may be difficult to get a table during busy times, and there is no outdoor seating due to limited space on the sidewalk.  That's really the only drawback I can think of, though.  This place is already my new go-to!",
