I will also say that I judge all asian restaurants by the quality and freshness of their fresh rolls or summer rolls. These were just odd. They were filled with an unusual amount of  jicama and something i couldn't discern. It may have been soy protein. I picked it out because it wasn't good. The dipping sauce tasted like it was mostly hoisin and it didn't come with the promised peanuts. The tempeh satay had good flavor but was served cubed over lettuce--kind of like a salad. All-in-all, it was just all a little unusual, and I don't really have a desire to return. The better reviews from others might be because they ordered a meal.  On a separate note, this establishment is mostly vegan but does offer dairy and non dairy ice cream.",
