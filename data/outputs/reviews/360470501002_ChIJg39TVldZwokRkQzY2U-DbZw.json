The bacon was fair but not as good as Peter Lugers. The short ribs were basically mashed potatoes with a little bit of short rib. Love my French onion soup. I got a porter house for 2 and it was salty and very oily 2 things I hate in a steak. Temp on the steak  was perfect (Medium rare). The side were beyond lack luster, we went against the waiters suggestions and we hated the side. A solid 3 for a steakhouse but would only go back for the bar!",

We never felt rushed once eventhough we spent alot of time taking pictures!:) When our food finally arrived, we were in heaven!!! The food was like eating chocolate and feeling happy. We had the lamb chops, 16oz new york strip, chicken cordon bleau, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn and spinach. The drinks and cheese cake were great as well.  Overall, it was worth the money.",

I ordered the 8 oz filet and my brother ordered the 12 oz and both were cooked to perfection.  They were so good that we actually ordered a second 8 oz filet with a challenge to the chef to make it as good as the first two. He accepted the challenge and he won! Well, we won because we got to eat the steak. The sides were exceptional, the wine selection was great and the staff was amazing! We most definitely plan on eating at DeStefano's again and again.",

We celebrated the last single night for our bestie who got married the next day and every request was delivered with aplomb and their attention to detail was second to none. We had the section to ourselves and were able to literally LOL without disturbing the revelers in the main dining room. All of the meal choices were flavorful, perfectly prepared and  #deeeelish!!! Absolutely one of the best lamb chops I've ever had. Pistachio encrusted lamb chops were fan-friggen-tastic!!! My friends had NY Strip steaks and cleaned their plates. We shared shrimp cocktail, the short rib appetizer in a pastry shell & crab cakes. The small sides feed two, the medium 3 to 4 and the large will serve a village. \ud83e\udd2d  Highly recommend DeStefano's. I had to take an Uber to the LIRR, then catch the 7 & G trains and walked in the rain for a couple of blocks to get there. It was worth it! #LocalGem #GreatEats #LambTastic #Steakhouse #RecoveringKnowItAll",

The porterhouse for 2 is a great option for any 2 diners so you can try the filet and strip. Both were butter knife tender and seasoned extremely well. The bone in rib eye is a great choice for those into a fattier steak. But my heart is still with the strip.  For sides, we had the garlic mashed potatoes, creamed corn, creamed spinach, both of the fries. All of the sides heavenly, just go with the small.  Going backwards to the appetizers, I loved the crab cakes and grilled portobello mushroom. The short rib spring rolls were great but I think more beef and less mash would\u2019ve been better. I was afraid I would get too full before the journey of meat ahead.",

Seasoned well. I recommend medium. The rib eye was juicy and nicely seasoned to the bone.  The sides. Mash is buttery and garlic heaven. Corn was so so. Spinach dip.... not enough portion.

From the moment entering the  place,  old school vibe and staff very welcoming. Michelle was our waitress. She was excellent. She helped my wife and I with the menu and suggest  things on the menu based on our Appetite.  The food was amazing from the appetizer to the dessert.  Started with the tomato, basil, and stuffed mozzerella. It was so good, sorry no picture that's how fast we ate it.  Main dish we both ordered the 160z NY Strip medium rare. So tender and mouth watering. Cut it with a \"Butter Knife\". Our side was the Garlic mashed Potatoes. Let me not even get started with this. I love mash and I could eat that  every day. Creamy smooth not overpowering with garlic.  For last we had the mousse trilogy. Fantastic it was. I ate more of it I did not want share it. I highly recommend this place  great food and amazing staff.",

From the moment we stepped in, it was a great experience. The bartender at the small bar by the front door was very friendly and funny. She made great drinks and would join us in conversation when she wasn't otherwise occupied. The food was absolutely delicious.  I ordered the 24oz rib eye medium rare, it was cooked perfectly. My wife got the filet, the seasoning was amazing and it was also cooked to a perfect med rare. They were both even better the next morning with eggs. Mmmm, I'm drooling just thinking about it. The server was funny as well and took a selfie with us after our group picture. We will definitely be returning very soon.",

[Atmosphere 4] It's about 20% cheaper than a high-class steakhouse and the atmosphere is casual. [Cooking 4] Very delicious Porterhouse steak is seasoned with olive oil, salt and a large amount of pepper. It has almost no aging. [Cost performance 4] It was about 20% cheaper than a high-class steakhouse, and the lunch menu and side menu were very reasonable and homely. [Customer service 5] The crisp woman at the reception was kind and polite and very pleasant.

The staff was very friendly and helpful with ordering. They initially told us they were just as good as Peter Lugars and they do not hand out steak knives as the steak is so tender. That was a bold statement to some serious meat eaters. I have to say they nailed it on all fronts. We had a porterhouse for two medium rare and it was fantastic. No steak knife needed. Wine choices were great and it was a great meal all around. We are so happy we tried this place. It\u2019s now on the list for pre or post game meals.",

The menu says it's becoming the most popular and I see why. My son had the lamb chops which of course I had to try and everyone else did too at the table. Again outstanding. My wife and my son's girlfriend had the filet. Perfect. We mentioned that it was our 29th wedding anniversary the other day, so what did they do, brought over a cheese cake with a candle.

        "caption": "VERY disappointed. My girlfriend and I were the first patrons at this restaurant on a Saturday morning. When we sat down a few more couples came in and sat down as well. We ordered the special for the day which was a burrata with heirloom tomatoes and it was good. For the entree we decided to split the 40 oz porterhouse since that is what most people try here (based on reviews). We ordered it Medium rare as per recommendation from the server.  When we got the steak it was so raw and chewy I was shocked. How can a $95 steak be cooked so poorly? It was COLD in the middle and it was so chewy I thought I would get TMJ from the amount of chewing I did. I asked the server to please have the chef cook it some more. When they brought it back IT WAS STILL RARE!!!!!! And then the server started giving me dirty looks and laughing with her coworker. I came to a steakhouse that servers over priced steaks. I EXPECT them to be flawless!!!!!  I'm really a non confrontational person so I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I asked for the steak to be doggy bagged and we left. And get this.... Right before we leave a couple that came in AFTER us, LEFT before us after they complained that their steaks were chewy and dry. We were not the only ones disappointed that day. The service could have been better as well, if you are a server and you can see your patrons are clearly dissatisfied with the meal.. SAY SOMETHING! Correct the problem and don't bring back the SAME problem!!  Folks, if you want a real quality dry-aged steak with REAL NYC service. I strongly suggest Wolfgangs!!!! They will come to you and FINISH the steak off right on the ceramic plate it comes in so it's nice and hot.  I will NEVER come back here!!!!",
