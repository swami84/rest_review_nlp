I ordered the \u201cBBQ pulled turkey\u201d with sides that were chosen for me.  Had a quick convo with staff at the very empty Dekalb market and told her it was hard for me to digest dark meat. She didn\u2019t reply but mentioned she added a sample of cheese cake. I liked the cafeteria style metal tray takeout but it leaked and I only carried the bag outside to eat.  Opening it, I understand why it leaked. She didn\u2019t strain the food thru a slotted spoon so everything was drowning in sauce. The turkey was all dark meat which wouldn\u2019t have been bad if it had any bbq type flavor. Either smoked, brined the meat or spice or liquid smoke in sauce. None of that and they were chunks of turkey I had to cut with a plastic knife- pulled meat allows more surface area for sauce to absorb. Beans were bland, cole slaw unremarkable- not sure why it\u2019s chopped- another issue with way they cut up the food so it doesn\u2019t soak up dressing. The meal tasted mostly of vinegar and sugar. And with the all dark meat, my stomach hurt afterwards... so much for healthy-ish BBQ.",
