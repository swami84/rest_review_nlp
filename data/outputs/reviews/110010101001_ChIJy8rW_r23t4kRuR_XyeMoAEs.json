The sauces for the filet mignon were an extra $6, which was not told by the server so we had no idea. Make sure to ask. Other than that, it was a lovely time.",

Bobby Van's gets 3 stars from me however because of the decor. They sat us in a side room to the right if the front door. I don't know if this is regular seating area or not but it was very off-putting. The carpet looked super dirty, each of the three or four chandeliers had lights burned out, accent mirrors on the wall were coming off, etc.etc. If your two blocks from the White House and charge as much as this place does you should really have the interior at least in basic kept up state. I didn't see the rest of the restaurant, maybe it's better in different rooms. But other than that things were great, again the dry aged steak we had was amazing, probably top 5 best steaks I've ever had.",

We aren't from the area, we had already paid for parking, and it was FREEZING outside! So we walked into Bobby Van's after seeing the amazing reviews. The atmosphere and decor were so upscale that my husband actually asked if there was a dress code since we were just trying to eat before a concert and were definitely not dressed in our best attire.  We were immediately welcomed and made to feel so comfortable.  We didn't have a reservation but thankfully it was early enough that we were sat immediately.  Our waiter Nelson was PHENOMENAL! He gave us suggestions on the menu options and helped us pick out one of the best meals we have ever had.  The sweet chili tossed calamari and the prosciutto mac and cheese will change your life! The food and service was so impeccable we will definitely be back. We have already started recommending Bobby Van's Steakhouse to anyone that will listen! If you're looking for fine dining, amazing atmosphere, and above-and-beyond service (THANK YOU NELSON) then you simply must go here!",

        "caption": "December 12, 2019. Background: I live in Severna Park MD. My mom and our friend Sherrie are visiting me this week. They came up from Georgia. Sherrie has never been to DC so we decided to book a hotel and spend a day or two siteseeing. Our day went great today! But come suppertime, we had no clue what or where to eat. We googled of course, but since we are walking we wanted something close to our hotel, The Madison on 15th NW (very nice hotel but will save that for a later review). With this day at an end, feeling hungry and in need of an adult beverage, we moseyed into Bobby Van's, and oh my goodness, we had no idea that we were in store for an amazing meal. Despite looking tired and being seriously underdressed (ex. Me in my jeans and an Auburn tshirt...War Eagle!), the host at the front door welcomed us with a warm understanding and had us seated within 10 minutes or so. Service: Our matredie  was promptly at our table, smiling and bantering with us, making us laugh. Drinks came quickly, in addition to ice water and warm fresh bread with real butter. Our drink orders were taken right away and we were instantly having a wonderful time! We were told about the specials and all of our questions and special requests were attended to very quickly.  For instance, I need a lot of lemon wedges. No problem, they brought me 6 wedges arranged nicely upon a glass via toothpicks so that I could discard the seeds and rimes. I thought that was so cute. Service throughout the evening continued to be reliable, consistent, and fun. And, at the end of the meal, when they were taking our plates off the table, they did that fancy thing with that crumb scraper to clean off the table top. Kudos to the staff. Environment: From the street, I thought it was a hotel entrance until we got closer. I looked through the windows and saw people eating. To be honest, we were so tired we just wanted a quick bite and to get back to our hotel. Thinking drinks, appetizers, and sleep. However, once inside, the aura gave us a second wind. White tablecloths and napkins. Tables meticulously set and ready. A nice bar. Everyone is smiling. The temperature is comfortable. The seating is comfortable. Lighting is great, especially if you are like me and can't see without cheaters. Holiday decorations everywhere. The bathrooms need improvement though. They are clean but outdated, albeit, this is an older building so dont let that deter you. Most of these old DC buildings need updating. Look at it as enjoying a part of history. Food: Mom and Sherrie ordered the surf and turf for $60 each. It came with lobster, a petite mignon filet and mashed potatoes (Picture included). I know that's a lot of money but they could not eat it all. Its huge! They will both get a second meal as leftovers. They even box it up for you themselves. I opted for the tomato/red onion plate with a side of sauteed garlic spinach. It was delicious. Here's what you need to know: The bread and butter will fill you up. Most everything is Alacarte. A few dishes do come with their own special sides, but the regular menu sides are served family style. These \"family style\" side portions are small. Consider this when they tell you family size...Not. I cant speak for the salads since we didnt get one. Price: Now to the nitty gritty. Expensive. Yes, great friendly super efficient staff. Yes, beautiful, cozy, comfortable environment. Yes, delicious food. But...expensive. My tomato/red onion plate had 3 slices of tomato and 2 slices of red onion. Dont get me wrong, I loved it. It was exactly what asked for. In addition, our matredie standing nearby, offered to bring me some parmesan or blue cheese to add. You are paying for the atmosphere and the service here. Dont bring the kids, they will be bored. As I mentioned earlier, we were underdressed. Everyone else was in business or dress casual. Overall: I'll go back in a heartbeat. And I'll recommend it to my friends.",

Sightseeing around the White House area, we were looking a nice place to cool off from the heat of the day, to enjoy an ice- cold beer, have a  light salad lunch in pleasant surroundings. We found this all at Bobby Vans. Excellent service and delicious food in a room that reminded me of a gentlemans club in London, lots of wood panelling, prints on the walls and servers in white jackets. Our prawn (shrimp) salads were perfect both to taste and to look at! My only complaint would be that  the Ladies toilets were not as neat and tidy as I would have expected at that quiet time of the day (we arrived at 4pm for a late lunch and the evening guests had not arrived so it was not at all busy). Paper on the floor, hand tissue waste bin overflowing. More care in the ladies restroom needed. Otherwise Bobby Vans to be highly  recommended!",

They are masters at the art of fine dining, and you will be automatically guaranteed premium steak, premium appetizers, entrees, premium drinks, premium desserts, and A-1 service. My husband, family & I came here 3 times thus far and I only come here when I want to take a break from all the other \"regular restaurants\" and service. This is gem and best kept secret located in the heart of DC's bustling town. I would suggest going onto open table and making reservations. They also offer great groupons if you are a penny saver or on a budget. I have net the manager personally and anything that I ever needed he was responsive to, fixed, and went above and beyond, giving extreme, authentic, customer service. You will not be let down, make your reservation today, honeymoon alone or with your family here. If you are a foodie, you will be in heaven. The food comes out consistent, and hits the mark everytime even with a blindfold on! Again, make your reservation TODAY to take your memorial day weekend to the NEXT LEVEL of pampered food treatment. Tell them I sent you as a top Goodle rated Reviewer! I hope to see the Manager again very SOON for arrangements to come back! ~Tiffany Lancaster Legislative Chair (DC Democratic Womens Club)/ANC Commissioner for the Mayor & DC City Council~",

The whole staff was very nice the moment we walked in and our waiter was very kind to my whole family and took our orders without hesitation.

And while the other times we've been that hasn't happened and the rest of the staff has been great that was a real put off.  As for the food it's always good, though the escargot we had was a bit bland (not bad just boring), it hasn't consistently been great. A couple times it has been but a few times we've left wishing we had gone to Ray's in Arlington because for that price being good isn't good enough.",

But your bill can be well over $150 still if ordering from every menu category including appetizer, drinks, entrees and dessert.  Food and drinks were absolutely delicious and service was impeccable!  Waiter was very attentive.  I started with the French onion soup.  It was made just right with the gooey cheese perfectly melted over the top of the bowl.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib-eye with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Steak was tender and seasoned well.  Mashed potatoes and green beans were bland, however, complimented the steak well.  I ordered the shrimp scampi in a white wine garlic sauce.  Simply scrumptious!  We followed with dessert, the warm apple tart and chocolate mousse cake which was delicious with magazine presentation.  Valet parking is available at this location.  Overall fantastic dining experience! Will definitely dine here again!",

I wanted to give five stars. My five star steak restaurant cooks steaks over a wood fire(fruit wood?).  The flavor of the meat  at my five star choice had just that extra \"something\" ...there was just that \"something\" missing from the steak that I had( I ordered filet mignon prepared Pittsburgh Rare). It was great, but in comparison, there was just something missing. My guest ordered the Porcini Delmonico that he claimed very good(his choice at all steakhouses). I will definitely go back with business associates and guests...enjoyed it!",

I didn't want to make a scene, so I had my friend quickly get up, move her coat and bag, and killed the roach with a napkin.  I showed the waiter, who apologized, and bought us the bill.  My friend asked to speak with the manager.  The  manager apologized and stated that the roach appeared after we ate.  I can only assume he felt killing a roach in his restaurant was not a problem, since we ate our meal.

        "caption": "Tonight my husband and I arrived for a date night away from our two young kids. We mentioned to our waiter that we had never been to a Bobby Van\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t pleased by any means to the \u201cquality\u201d of the food. We felt the food was flavorless, mediocre and not anywhere close to what you expect for a $50 charred/burned steaks.  Let\u2019s break it down by course. We started with the buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad. This is one of my fav combinations, but I found the mozzarella to be very chilled and watery. It didn\u2019t seem fresh and didn\u2019t even eat my half. We also tried the calamari which was incredibly rubbery. My husband mentioned that\u2019s normal, I\u2019ve had better.  We then ordered our entrees. I choose the petite filet with side of Mac and cheese. As you see in the pictures, my steak was completely burned and tasteless. The cost of this masterpiece is $49. I quickly told the waiter that I wouldn\u2019t be enjoying this steak after taking one bite. He offered to bring me something else or remake it. Based on all the food I had at this point, I wasn\u2019t willing to try again. The Mac and cheese as seen in picture was soaking in oil and almost worth forgoing as well...but at this point in hour into the meal I was hungry. My hubby ordered the ribeye which was also charred and burned. They took it back to \u201cremake\u201d it...20 mins later the $54 steak returns and is too pink to eat. It is then sent back an additional time. 20 mins more later it returned and he ate it bc again he was hungry. The manager came over to greet us and ask if I wanted anything else, he rudely informed me that all the steaks are cooked a certain way and it says so in the menu. Ok, well Your a well known steakhouse and we are new to the restaurant and figured you could make a decent $50 steak. Customers are always right...no so much. Took 45 mins and two different times of making this mediocre ribeye and it was still not removed from the bill.  $200 later with two apps, 2 drinks, 1 steak and some sodas...we won\u2019t be back and are truly disappointed in our experience and broke pockets.",
