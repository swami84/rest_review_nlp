One of my friends did not order anything she said she did not like the way it looked. I ordered the meat loaf, ramen Mac and cheese and mixed veggie. While riding in my friends car back home we noticed a foul order. My friend closed the window thinking the smell was from outside. I was dropped off to my car and while driving I noticed the same smell. That\u2019s when I realized it was the food. The  meatloaf was two big very salty pierces. They were frozen before it was cooked and the veggie was cold. The ramen Mac and cheese had no flavor and the Mac and cheese and veggies portions was small. I called Memphis Seoul to see if I can get a refund or exchange it for something else. I spoke with a guy named Richard.I explained the situation to him .I told him that if he doesn\u2019t resolve it I will write a review. He placed me on hold to speak with the owner. I overheard the owner yelling saying that he doesn\u2019t care about what I said about the portion and the food and he doesn\u2019t care if I write a bad review. The owner got on the phone and was extremely rude he said he doesn\u2019t offer refunds. I asked if I can exchange it for something else. He said he\u2019s not doing anything for me since I said I was going to write a review. He said he doesn\u2019t care if I write a review. I would not recommend anyone going to Memphis Seoul if you are unhappy with your over priced food you can\u2019t even complain.

        "caption": "It was my first time coming here and I cannot say when I will be back. I ordered several items off the menu, but here are the 2 highlights that I think sum up my experience.  The ramen n' cheese: as someone who's spent their childhood growing up in the south and a lover of korean spices I was expecting a combination of both flavor profiles, but it just wasn't there. Instead it was the seasonings you would put on baked mac & cheese and put into ramen. There was memphis flavor that was to be expected, but the \"Seoul\" was nowhere to be found.  Strawberry Soju Cake: this one is iffy and totally dependent on what type of sweet tooth you have. At times I want my dessert to be super sweet and other times not so much. Luckily this cake came on a day where I wanted my dessert to be super sweet. The strawberry flavor could be tasted in both the cake and icing, and although someone might think that this might be too much strawberry it's not. One thing that was missed was the soju flavor. Maybe it was taken out within the cooking process, but I wasn't able to detect it. Also the icing is thick, think of fondant but more manageable.  Overall the experience did not match up to my expectations, but that doesn't mean that all hope is lost. Hopefully in the future I will be able to taste more the of the \"Seoul\" in my food.",
