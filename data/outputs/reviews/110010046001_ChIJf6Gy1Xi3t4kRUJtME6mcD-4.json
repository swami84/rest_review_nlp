The restaurant has transitioned to reusable cups and flatware as primary and one-use plastic as secondary. The staff were extremely welcoming and kind. Additionally, the new tortilla recipe is really good. Looking forward to many more successful years for Sam and team. Definitely Truxton Circle's flagship restaurant.  Food is very solid but the customer service is a work in progress. We ordered tacos and an iced coffee. The restaurant defaults to giving customers plastic cups for in-restaurant drink orders. When my girlfriend asked if we could have the iced coffee in a glass, Luis at the register begrudgingly remarked, \"it would be helpful if you brought your own glass.\"  Behind him were multiple glasses that he could use. Luis was unexpectedly demeaning and made us feel unwelcomed. Republic Cantina is a nice addition to the neighborhood, but the restaurant's environmental responsibility and customer experience have significant room for improvement.",

Really loved the complimentary chips and salsa and the torta tasted really fresh.  The cider drink was hot and didn\u2019t taste too strongly of whiskey. I don\u2019t like whiskey as much as I used to so I was really glad about this!  The fajitas. OMG. So good. We ordered the chicken, pork shoulder and shrimp fajitas. Highly recommend. The tortillas were excellent as well.  Only docking a star because the service was rather sporadic and our waiter disappeared for quite some time and never came over to our table between the appetizer and the ordering of the main meal.

I tend to judge Tex-Mex by the guac and they passed with flying colors. Simple ingredients and very flavorful.  We'll definitely be back.  Delicious breakfast tacos. Egg and brisket was really tasty. Pecan cream cheese kolache also really yummy. Bought six more kolaches to take to the office. Decor and ambiance was great. Looking forward to coming back for dinner soon.",

We had the fortune to participate in one of their pre-opening dinners which featured chips and salsa (with optional queso), margaritas (spicy, classic, etc.), tostados, burrito skillets and fajitas. We crushed the chips and salsa quickly - were delicious and high quality. Our margaritas were expertly mixed. The tostada was tasty and a decent size that was shareable. The chicken fajitas were really good - portion generous - and came out sizzling! My favorite however, was the enchilada skillet - 3 homemade fluffy tortillas in a skillet with gooey cheese across all three. We stuffed ourselves and didn't leave room for dessert, which looked incredible. Specifically, the banana bread pudding ice cream concoction we saw the table next to us receive and promptly devour. This is a high quality place that was done properly. We finally have a place around the corner to enjoy and proudly share with guests from other areas. It has taken a while but has been worth the wait.",
