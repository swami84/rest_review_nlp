Even offered to give me my money back and tried to cut me off as I spoke.  Oh wait to top it off the place was empty I was the first customer to walk in smfh. Don\u2019t think the was ready to wait on anyone or maybe my mom wheel chair scared them. I think I even heard them laughing while I walked out.

The last two times horrible not the mini crawfish not that much sauce was not spicy at all like the first two times.  and the sauce was water and what is this a half a potato now. Not acceptable I\u2019m giving them a three just because I\u2019m being nice..  My opinion do not slack down keep it going the way it\u2019s supposed to be people do notice a difference I did.  Hi I was able to go back to Captain Loui Harlem locations on 154th St. and eighth Avenue. I was able to go back to re-order from my last review I definitely notice they definitely step the game up the sauce is definitely spicy it\u2019s back how was the first time...  I order from them and I definitely recommend this location 100% keep up the good work Harlem location on our 154th.. \ud83d\udc4d",
