Bouillabaisse broth is the best I've had. Slight nit is that the seafood could be fresher, esp the prawns, but at the price point it's not really an issue. Wines by the bottle selection is excellent - a tidy list with good value. I'll ask for less salt in the Bouillabaisse, no dressing with the salads, and no oil on anything - esp the smoked salmon.",

The food was fantastic. The onion soup very tasty, the p\u00e2t\u00e9 spectacular and the steak au poivre, despite having to bring it home on a 15 minute car ride, was perfectly medium rare and delicious. The really thin \u201ctrue\u201d French fries were a great side, too. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, while much thicker than you usually see, is the best cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e I\u2019ve ever had.

Chez joel Bistro is a unique French restaurant that has now become my favorite place to spoil myself with decadent French food and a loving, playful vibe.  Last week on July 27 I wanted to go somewhere special for my birthday and I had a craving for French food so I did my online research and found this elegant and welcoming gem.  I told the hostess Amber over the phone that I was reserving a small table for one and that I was also celebrating my birthday.  I arrived at 8pm and to my great delight I found out they have an outside patio with romantic lighting and plants. I asked if I could sit outside instead and she made that possible for me within just fifteen minutes.  As I was seated all the servers and bus people worked smoothly as a friendly, unified and cohesive team. Agnes brought me a menu and made some suggestions after I inquired about their various appetizers.  I chose the warm brie which I thoroughly enjoyed, the fresh beet salad and the escargot which was buttery and succulent.  The crusty baked French bread is some of the best I've ever tasted and it went well with the escargot sauce.  They then surprised me with a birthday dessert of ice cream and a candle and since I already ordered profiteroles it almost felt \"naughty\" but hey it's my birthday who diets on their birthday! I loved my meal so much that I returned twice more and enjoyed a dinner with a friend of mine yesterday where I ordered the sea scallops and delicious chocolate moose for dessert.  This late afternoon I wanted to sit outside again and try their prix fixe menu so I chose the French onion soup, seared salmon with vegetables and profiteroles again for dessert. Agnes was my server on all three visits and Gabriel did an excellent job bringing over plates and water if Agnes was too busy. This afternoon I met Carlitos and he gave me the names of the staff here who were so helpful and welcoming. If you love to spoil yourself and really relish and take your time in a true European atmosphere then you will truly appreciate the level of service, the comforting, beautiful setting and the succulent French cuisine.  In my estimation this bistro is one of the very best restaurants I've come across for authentic French cuisine and positive vibes.  Even if you just wish to come here for a few appetizers your experience here will be a positive one and I guarantee you will leave feeling satiate.",

I sat down with my girlfriend and ordered a calamari appetizer. If you're dining alone order three. The appetizer is literally gone in one bite.  Next I ordered a New York strip that came with pomme frites. If you don't know what pomme frites are they're thin cut french fries cooked in vegetable oil. Really fancy, not. The steak was not quite a half inch thick. Something you would get at Denny's if you ordered steak and eggs, or a local bar if you ordered a steak sandwich. I asked the waiter if the meat was prime and he said yes. NOT. The price for this entree was 24$. I've never been to steak n shake but I'm sure you could eat this same meal there for 5$. I have never felt so taken advantage of at a restaurant in my life. That was yesterday and I still can't believe Chez Joel has the audacity to call themselves a restaurant. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE FOOD AT OUTRAGEOUS PRICES. I left the restaurant and went across the street and had a burger. That was pretty good. My recomendation is zero stars.",

The place reassembles a real French bistro with the tables right next to each other. While it may be uncomfortable for some, nice French background music and attentive service make the restaurant feel cozy and warm. The menu consists of simple traditional French fare including staples like French onion soup and escargot. For my entree I had a duck and rabbit confit which was amazing. We hope to revisit this restaurant soon even though it is located a bit out of our way in Little Italy.",
