The bathrooms are gross, and for the past six months the main floor looks like it's been swept from time to time but not mopped. I used to order food here but now I get a prewrapped cookie at most.

It took a second for them to take my order because of switching over the drawers, but I\u2019ve worked in food service before and was more than happy to wait!  I liked the veggie selection on the Veggie Panini\u2014 though the focaccia was soggy :/ (seen in photo). I would\u2019ve liked more of a \u201ccrunch\u201d when eating it. I think the panini press may have pressed more liquid into the bread from the veggies than expected. Other than the bread, I liked the savory taste and variety of sandwiches they had. I\u2019ll definitely be coming back to try the drinks!  I read some comments on here about it not being trans-friendly and, as a trans person, treaded with caution. However, I wasn\u2019t gendered at all, which was lovely! Happy to know this experience with their staff included gender-neutral language. It\u2019s a tough world out there for trans folks, and so this was reassuring.  Can\u2019t wait to return!",

The grilled sandwiches I get are amazingly tasty and the price is perfect for the portions you get,  but I still haven't tried any coffee drinks.  They are doing some remodeling and one of the servers told me they are expanding to offer a wine bar and a speakeasy so don't be turned off by the construction or other things going on upstairs or downstairs.   If you go at peak times of the day expect it to be busy and you will have to wait.  I usually go after 2pm to avoid the lunch crowd.   Great place to get a pretty healthy and tasty lunch or snack",

This is jarring and embarrassing as some of my friends only know me by my preferred name. And I was presenting as the opposite gender of the name on my card.  Any other coffee shop I\u2019ve been to asks for a name on the order. I even heard the cashier ask for other people\u2019s names, but not mine. It may have been an honest mistake, but at the very least, this was insensitive.  On top of all this, the food was way over priced. Most definitely not returning here.  Edit: Wow. I just wanted to add a response to the owner. Changing your name legally is an incredibly expensive, time consuming process. I have started this myself, but not all trans folks have those resources available. It would be incredibly accommodating and little effort to your business to just ask card customers what they\u2019re name is. Every other coffee shop I\u2019ve been to in Chicago asks my name even if I pay with card.",

This spot is super cozy but the service is absolutely atrocious. They are always out of ingredients, the ordering counters are confusing, and the employees always seem to be frustrated. I hadn\u2019t been there for a year or so because of previous bad experiences but thought I\u2019d give it another try today... I waited 25 mins for a to go panini sandwich... I had to go to the counter to ask what where it was. I asked for it to go but it was brought to me on a plate... upon eating it, it was cold and the ingredients did not taste fresh. My cappuccino was also watery and flavorless... as I was leaving I spoke to a woman who received a splinter in her leg from one of their chairs... they only had one employee running the front of house and she was on her phone/computer half of the time. It\u2019s a huge bummer because it could be an amazing coffee shop but it is very clear that the management at this shop doesn\u2019t care for the space or their employees. I live several blocks away from this shop and will not be returning.",

I\u2019m all about shopping small and supporting local businesses, but the Bourgeois Pig is not worth your time or money. The owner can\u2019t properly manage his inventory or his finances, constantly running out of multiple ingredients for both the kitchen and coffee bar; he also frequently bounces employees\u2019 paychecks, causing them to go several weeks to even months unpaid. The prices here would make you think you\u2019re getting high-quality food, but spoiler alert: If it\u2019s in stock at all, it\u2019s probably because someone grabbed it from the CVS down the street. Most of the food is reheated in the microwave; nothing is made to order, aside from the sandwiches (if you can get one!). The kitchen staff is often unable to make half (or more) of the menu due to the lack of ingredients. I mean, what kind of coffee shop can\u2019t even keep coffee in stock? The facility is a dump; nothing is ever properly sanitized or cleaned, and I can only imagine what the health department would have to say about the condition of their food prep area. On one occasion, I was grinding coffee and some of it sprayed out of the grinder onto the counter (because the grinder was probably older than I am), and when I went to sweep it into the garbage can, I was instructed not to waste product and put it back in the coffee machine instead. The owner was (and probably still is) in so much debt with the towel sanitizing company that we had to \u201cwash\u201d the towels we used to clean kitchen equipment ourselves by soaking them overnight in buckets of water. He also treats his employees like garbage and creates an extremely stressful environment. I could go on, but I\u2019d hope this has been enough to encourage you to take your business elsewhere.",

Pros: - has two divided sides: a quiet half for reading and study, and a half where you can have free conversation with your pals - very unique atmosphere - student discount - the scones Cons: - the coffee is either bad or just prepared poorly - not the most organised during a rush  The pig is my favourite place to do homework or bring a friend to catch up. The fact that it has two halves makes it the perfect setup for any occasion. The old-timey wooded decor and seating creates a cozy atmosphere. It is the most beautiful during the Autumn months!  I never truly enjoy the coffee here but i love trying a tea from their extensive variety! Pair it up with a scone and a book and you are in for an experience that is hard to find in a city with modern, sterile coffee shops!",

In addition, the place, formerly an institution renowned among DePaul students as much as others, bears less and less closer visual inspection.  The ceiling fan for instance, covered in a mix of dust and cooking oils, represents a major challenge to anybody's appetite.

Also, working here was hell, as we always ran out of everything and would have to improvise what to tell customers. There were multiple times when we had literally run out of coffee beans.

I had been craving waffles for a month, but my waistline needed nothing more than broccoli soup and green beans. Mind over matter, I went to La Pig. I loved it.  The place itself looks like an old house thats been renovated. Both downstairs and upstairs have wooden tables and chairs, but upstairs has old victorian seating as well- a chaise, and chairs made of purple chintz. Never thought I would see that outside England. Love the kitsch artwork on the walls as well.  My waffle was AMAZING. I had nutella and honey on mine and it remained crisp till the end, even though I took 2 hours to eat it. And I ate the whole thing too. M had the italian sandwich, which was pretty good, but I would really recommend the waffle :)",

Their hours fluctuated wildly, from being open until 10ish when I was a freshman, to closing at 6, to being 7-7 everyday now. The coffee is almost always burnt, but not undrinkable. The sandwiches are pretty good, depending on what you get, but overpriced. The space is big, but goofily laid out.  I get the sense they just don't know what to do with it. It used to be that drinks were on one side and food on the other, but there have been so many changes made in the past few years I can't keep up.  The ambiance is nice, and it's a good place to meet and get something done. I keep coming back, clearly, hoping it's become everything I want it to be. And maybe it will one day.",

I didn't even try the potatoes because they looked dry, cold and nasty. We didn't have a good experience at all.",

I had walked by every day on my way home from work and it looked like a nice and comfortable place to have coffee.  We arrived after open and walked in.  Both workers ignored us so we asked if they were open and they said \"sort of\".  We offered to come back in a few minutes but again, we were ignored. After sitting at a table for five minutes we decided to leave and try another coffee shop down the street.  Worst customer service I've ever experienced.",
