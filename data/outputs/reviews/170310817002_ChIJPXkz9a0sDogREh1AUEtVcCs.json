Surprisingly the food is not too expensive,  I mean for Boston,  paid around $38 dollars for 3 people . Overall quality service was great,  food was good too and well presented but my Nachos were completely well made exactly how I want it. Love to be at Rock Bottom!",

Despite being stuck in traffic and a 15 minute late arrival they were nice enough to honor our reservation, they easily could have said \"sorry\" and I would have understood.  Little trouble ordering beer as three options were out, the waitress was clearly frustrated with the situation and lack of an updated menu, however we worked through it without a problem. Food came in a timely manner, I had the pulled pork sandwich which was very good, however nothing super special. Others had burgers and each raved about how good they were, and after trying a bite I must admit they make a great burger here, not sure what their trick is but I regretted not getting one.  We were on our way across the street just in time for the show. Great spot, just get a reservation.",

Our waitress left our table mid drink order for no apparent reason and returned only to forgot to take the order of someone in our party.

When I asked to clean the table, the guy who walked us in gave me an attitude. During the meal, and before we were done, the waiteress brought us the check. We told her that we were not done yet and we were going for deserts so she took the bill back. At this stage we had not asked for the check yet. Of course, when the bill came we were not generous on our gratuity. I gave about $4.00 of gratuity only. However, when I received my bank statement tha tip charged to my credit card had been $14.00. In short, they took $10.00 more without my consentment. I was ROBBED. I contacted my credit card company, but I din't have the slip that shows the gratuity. Please remeber that in the U.S., they give you a printout of the bill and then you add the gratuity by hand. I only had the slip with the amount of the bill without the gratuity. LESSON: In this restaurant service is very poor and you are ROBBED. You don't need to be mugged in the streets. You will be mugged in the restaurant itself. Be careful in trusting them your credit card and don't expect a good service.",

Tomatoes used we're the same ones used for burgers and literally no sign of any tomatoes sauce. Can't speak for anything else. My colleagues seemed to be mildly content with their burgers. But to screw up a pizza is like burning toast. Takes a special kind of lazy/stupid. Thanks for wasting calories.",

Everything was brought out to us, she checked on us a couple of times and we were all good. Then about a 1/2 hour goes by and she has not been back. We see her serving her other tables with no problems but we are just there. One person in our group whistles to get her attention, yes probably a little much but we were being ignored. She comes over, asks how she can help us, we let her know that we would just like the check and she responds by saying she will get our server. Ummm ma'am,  you are our server. About 5 minutes later the, what I am assuming is the manager comes over and asks if all is okay. We say yes, just waiting on the check. He brings the check and leaves. I notice there are 2 charges on the bill that don't belong to us. I let him know, he removes them. He then proceeds to try and rush us out of the restaurant. Needless to say between the server and the managers attitudes and treatment we didn't leave a tip. Which is sad because like I started off with we had a quite enjoyable start to the evening. I believe she may of just forgotten about us which is cool. Just own it and apologize.",

When he told the server that it did not seem right, she just said \u2018you don\u2019t like it, I will take it off the check\u2019. When we got the check, the wine she had to adjust from our check was a muscato; had she asked the bartender if the wine he served was a sauvignon blanc, she would have realized her error and could have corrected it.

The last two times that we ate here, we were not impressed with the service and I was not impressed with my food. When we ate here a month and a half ago, they messed up my wife\u2019s order, but didn\u2019t send it back because the waiter was no where to be found. Tonight, she did like her mac & cheese, but my brother-in-law and his girlfriend both ordered a SIDE Caesar salad. The waiter asked if they both wanted to add chicken. She said no and he said yes. They brought her a side Caesar and him a full Caesar with chicken. We were not able to correct his order as again our waiter was no where to be found. When the bill came, she was charged for a full Caesar at $9.99 and he was also charged for a full Caesar with chicken though he order a side. I informed the waiter of this and he fixed the price of her salad, but informed us that my brother-in-law\u2019s salad only came in full because it had chicken. I told him that he ordered a side and that he had asked him if he wanted to add chicken to it. I also informed him that he should have made him aware that the side did not come with chicken and he would be getting a full salad and be changed for a full salad, as it was double to price. For these last times we ate at this restaurant, we were there for shows in the area. We didn\u2019t have time to wait for our waiter to check back in and correct our above issues, nor should we have to wait for a waiter to check in. The waiters never made it a point to check in once dropping the food off at the table. Our waters never were refilled and plates weren\u2019t cleared from the table. I understand that this is a busy area, especially when there are shows going on, but that doesn\u2019t excuse poor service. Needless to say, moving forward, my wife and I will no longer be dining at this restaurant.",

We were seated promptly but then waited for 10 minutes before the waiter came over, took our drink order and then left.  10 Minutes later he showed up again to take our drink order - what?  We already ordered...he quickly ran back to the bar and grabbed 4 glasses of water  and while heading back to the table, dumped one completely, spilled half of another and put them all on the table, sans lemon.  Then came the drinks, by the time arrived with my husbands martini and spilled some of it on him, there was 1/2 a martini!  It was almost as if he was drunk, and then he wasn't, it was weird.  The food was just okay...nothing to write home about.  Then a very large cider showed up - we had not ordered it, but what didn't was the beer that we did order - when the nice young lady who was a food runner delivered our food, we asked her to check on the order and she told us the beer we ordered was not available - huh?  Okay, she was great and brought our new order over promptly.  Now the check comes, some items we didn't order was on the bill, others we did weren't, we figured out the tab and it worked out about right so we sent the waiter off with our credit card.  The receipt arrived (five dollars less then the tab was) we signed and headed out.  Fast forward 3 hours later at the Tam after a show at the Cutler, and things became abundantly clear as we watched the same guy chug a water glass full of vodka and walk out the door!  Amazing.",

I was told the problem was they didn't have any tables....The entire time I waited there were multiple tables that no one was ever seated at. They didn't say they were short on waiters (I would have been more accepting of that), short on tables. They told me it should only be a \"couple\" more minutes. We decided to order some appetizers as we were starving and had a show to get to. Over an hour and half after we arrived, we received the call to get a table. I understand it can be difficult to estimate the wait time, but you had open tables all night. The appetizers were pretty good and the bartenders were great.",

I think we were seated in 15 mins, at most. Our seats gave us the view of all the theater district madness (I like to people watch). Our server Alicia was nice, attentive, and made good recommendations. The food was pretty good, this place great for socializing with friends, and happy hour. Definitely plan on going back soon.",

But went at night and it was a totally different experience... the waitress with bright red hair was extremely rude. First my party and I ordered drinks at the bar, but we decided to close our tabs and get appetizers and drinks at a table. So we asked the host if we could sit at a table that was open. He said yes and when the waitress came over to my group she asked us to get up from her table when we wanted service. We explained that the drinks in our hands were paid for and that we wanted to get a menu to order drinks and apps. She said that she would get us a menu but never came back. When I approached her asking if she was still going to come over (after about 25 minutes) with a menu, she rudely explained that she couldn't ring in anything at the computers and that she wasn't our waitress even though she was the one to come over to us in the first place. Instead of coming over and explaining we were just ignored and she walked by us several times swearing underneath her breath. Extremely unprofessional.",
