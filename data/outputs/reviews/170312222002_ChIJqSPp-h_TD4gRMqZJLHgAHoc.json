It was so cold inside that I couldn\u2019t feel my fingers or toes. We originally planned on dining in but after we realized how cold it was, we asked for our food to go. When we got our food my french toast was ice cold as well as the syrup, and the jelly for my boyfriend\u2019s toast was frozen. I know this is a new business so I hate to give a bad review, but our experience was unacceptable. Hopefully things improve for future customers.",

Hands down, their Green Chilaquiles are delicious! Not too spicy, and not too mild, just right on the spice level. Good portion size too.",
