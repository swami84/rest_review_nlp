There are two types of reviewers, ones that only review to berate businesses that they had a \"bad\" experience in or to legitimately review.  I put \"bad\" in quotations because that's completely subjective.  I'm posting this review as a clap back to the misinformation posted in the review before my own.  This Starbucks is a relatively small starbucks and they're very good at what they do despite such small staff compared to other Starbucks that I've been too.  Today being a holiday I knew they would be a little busier than usual bit I didn't mind because I know the baristas will always get my drink right. (An Americano isn't that hard to mess up).  But on the slight chance that there is a mess up, the baristas are always willing to do their best to make that drink the way you want, given if you have the time to wait.  This one lady in front of me had trouble being patient.  Never before had I'd seen so much pent up rage and a middle aged woman who has to wait five minutes for her drink to be remade not once, not twice, but three times.  Not to mention she a requested to change the drink each time.  Nevertheless the barista complied as best as she could but there was no quelling this lady's anger.  I guess she couldn't understand that there was other customers waiting behind her patiently waiting for their drinks as well.  And I don't I've ever heard of someone so offended by an offer to refund a drink because they couldn't get their own order right. Cheers to the barista keeping her cool, I don't think anyone would do well with an outraged customer breathing down their neck.  To close, this is one of my favorite Starbucks to visit.  I can always count on them to brighten my days with some well crafted coffee and some small talk about coffees they'd reccomend.",

I ordered an iced caramel machiato  this morning but It did not taste right as usual so I asked a barista named Chloe to remake it. She was making other people's drink so I patiently waited. But she did not bother to make mine at all so after 15-50mts of wating, I asked her if she can make mine cuz I gotta go. She remade it but with different recipe I asked her earlier. I think at that point she did not want to remake it again. So she told me with such attitude, \" we will give you refund if you do not like this one\" It was not courteous offer. I could tell from the  tone of her voice and look, she was telling me\" can't you see I am busy now? Just get your money and leave if you do not like the drink I just made again\"The manager at the shop, Justin quickly offered me a  coupon for a free drink. I rejected cuz I did not make a complaint to get a free drink. The whole situation at this shop was unpleasant.",

On our last day, we bought a double shot, taking it to the condo to make sure the next day, before going to the Airport we would have our coffee.  The staff was very friendly and we developed a relationship, on this, our last day, we took photos and promised to make a review through Google.  Watch as the attendant waves good bye...
