I understand how it's convenient and tempting to add costs, but at least be transparent. I would expect the delivery fee to go to the person delivering the food. Anything less is dishonest. Mario says he doesn't make the rules but he's taking advantage of his workers nonetheless.",

Anyone who uses Uber Eats knows how frustrating it is to get through to an actual person. I called back Jets and let them know Uber was going to have to refund me for the mess up. The manager Carl was amazing!! He apologized profusely (even though it wasn\u2019t Jets fault, it was Uber\u2019s) and wanted to make the situation right. He offered to remake my order complimentary and have someone from their store deliver it to me. The whole staff was super kind in a situation where I was not. The food was delicious and they have incredible customer service! I highly recommend this Jets! :)",

We've tried other delivery pizzas but every place we have tried has had issues getting us quality and correct food with our large orders but not Jets. We started working with Brian one of the managers for our orders and he is wonderful. We even had an issue where we ordered too little food and he had an extra pizza out and in our office in less than 15 minutes. Highly recommended!",

I originally had no intention of eating at Jet's pizza but it was recommended by a colleague and figured it was worth a try. I've worked at my fair share of pizza places and so I wasn't necessarily worried about being disappointed by the flavor, but after trying their Eugene pizza, cooked well-done, I was blown away. But that wasn't even the best part... What surprised me the most was the outstanding service that their employees provided. They were extremely welcoming and accommodating while we were waiting for our pizza which is honestly not something you can always expect from a pizza place. The overall experience was very pleasant and I can tell why people keep coming back. I would highly recommend this location.",

It's not typical Chicago style deep dish but I appreciate the difference. The crust is puffy and cheese and sauce taste fresh. I will definitely order from here again. I don't know what took me so long, but now I have to make up for lost time. I'd been going to Whole Foods for a slice, but I like this better. The only negative is that it's a total take-out place, thus nowhere to sit.",

The  manager said they would have it delivered in less than an hour (which is still too long to begin with), and took over 2 hours and still no delivery or call!!!! When we called to see where our pizza was, the manager put us on hold and hung up. It took calling 3 times to finally have a conversation with her.  Terribly run establishment. NEVER GO HERE. The owner needs to rethink who he/she staffs at this poorly run restaurant. I wouldn't be surprised if this location went out of business in the next year.  Absolutely pathetic.",

But I like to get to restaurants earlier if I place a grubhub because its most likely done before the time they say. But anyways I get there and my pizza was not fresh, so I asked the cashier if they had any fresh pizza available. She asks the manager ( not sure of his name) and he was a complete jerk. He said they make there pizza fresh all the time but clearly the pizza I was handed was not fresh. So I asked the cook was it a big issue for me wanting my food that I paid for fresh and he said : NO and I do apologize about this matter. So the manager asked the cook once he went back to get me the fresh slices I preferred and the manager asked him was I ordering more ( as far as paying for another order). The cook handed me the pizza and told me to have a great day.  This is no good customer service at all on the managers part.
