I was expecting some authentic and modern combinations but unfortunately, this place really missed the bar on every single level.  While I ordered on Uber eats,  the restaurant uses their own drivers to deliver food. The est delivery was between 15-35 min. My food was over an hour late and I live 10 min away from the restaurant. I called the restaurant MULTIPLE times to ask for an update on my order I kept getting a voicemail. Finally, when someone answered they said they were just waiting for a driver to pick it up. I pushed back and said Uber states that Asadito Employee is to deliver my food? The gentleman then says \"oh I'm sorry,  I'm in the back and your food is in the front, what's your name again?\" He was just trying to rush me off the phone without even looking into my order? Their unprofessionalism is very evident in the responses on Yelp from the business parter \u201cTyler M\u201d who clearly doesn\u2019t know how to talk to customers. Their customer service and food is laughable.  Unfortunately, the disappointment doesn't stop there.  I had a taco al pastor, barbacoa, and marinated ribeye. I can't wrap my head around how it LOOKS beautifully marinated and flavorful but it was bland and lacked. The consume was unpalatable. If it weren't for the salsa verde and roja, I would not have been able to finish my meal and this is not an exaggeration.  I was expecting a delicious rice but instead it was boring and some of it was even uncooked. The black beans had an insane amount of black pepper and no salt or flavor otherwise. These are the basics of any Mexican dish.  Overall, I'm really dissapointed at this poor excuse of a Mexican restaurant. There is nothing innovative or modern about their food -let alone *AUTHENTIC*.  Yes, this sounds harsh but when you're located in Chicago and charging people $4 a taco and $15 a burrito...make it make sense. This place is a complete JOKE. Food is trash. I'm really confused how this place has any good ratings at all given how poorly all the flavors (or lack thereof) come together.  If you've ever had a taco from literally any restaurant in Pilsen or Little Village, you know what a QUALITY taco tastes like. Take your money to Carneceria Maribel on 1801 W Cermak -you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

I was a bit nervous going anywhere after 4 months of being extremely cautious but was put at ease as soon as we arrived. They have a ton of outdoor patio space and even with 5+ other groups eating and drinking on the patio we had no issues with social distancing. Employees were masked both inside and out and masks were required for guests entering the indoor part of the establishment.  We tried basically all of their tacos and every single one was delicious. Margaritas were tasty too, and not overly sugary or watered down like you find at a lot of places these days. Although the business functions primarily via counter service, the staff there were extremely attentive in coming out to check on our group regularly, making sure we had everything we needed.  The patio is also dog friendly which was another big draw for us. The staff even brought water out for the pups multiple times which we were very grateful for. My only complaint about this place is that they aren't open on weekends, although being located in the Loop I understand their reasoning.  Definitely go check this place out, you won't be disappointed!",

The chicken tinga was juicy and flavorful, the special taco of the day - potato - was sweet but spicy (maybe it was yucca, but the sign said potato...) and the chips were extremely fresh. The guac either had too many onions or added jicama, a little too texture-y for me, but not a deal breaker. Great side sauces, excellent tequila and mezcal list and cheap beer.  There was some miscommunication at the register when I told the cashier what I ordered - she repeated back, \"Taco special?\" and I said, no, \"One chicken, one daily special and chips and guac.\" And then she said, \"Ok, taco special.\" *SHRUG* I didn't see anything on the menu about a taco special, or lunch special, so if that exists, it should be marketed a bit better.  If you want a drink, you have to order from the bar. I wasn't aware you could sit at the bar and order food AND drinks, so they could relay that, as well.  I definitely want to try the elotes so I'll be back soon.",
