There also wasn\u2019t any tomatoes in rice which I have had before.  Thai ice tea was okay, but the tea tasted a little stale/old/bitter.  But I\u2019ll definitely come back!

What's worse is that they don't take credit cards.  The lady didn't tell me that when she took my order.  It wasn't until after I ate my food (which really didn't take too long to do since there was hardly any food on my plate.), & went back to the counter to pay my bill that I saw a tiny hand-written sign saying \"Cash Only\".  The guy told me that I could go to their web page & pay for my dinner online with a credit card.  WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD PAY FOR A DINNER THAT THEY JUST ATE ONLINE AFTER THEY ATE IT?!  Since I'm an honest person, I walked back out in 16 degree weather past the same group of guys that had been smoking drugs in front of the restaraunt during my entire time there-45 minutes (20 minutes eating & the rest sitting, checking my phone).  I could smell the weed from these guys every time someone opened the reztauaunt's door, & NO ONE FROM THE STAFF HAD THE NERVE TO ASK THEM TO LEAVE OR CALL THE POLICE!  So I communicated my complaints to the guy & he rudely told me that everyone knows they're a cash only place.  NOT TRUE.  They're near one of the largest colleges in NYC & have only been open for 4 months.  Not EVERYONE knows that!   Then he tried to argue with me when I insisted on just getting my change and leaving.  Then he continued to be rude & told me that if I leave a complaint, he'll reply back.  Good luck to them.  I'm not coming back & I don't recommend that anyone goes there.  Not with those small portions & poor service We deserve better than that.",
