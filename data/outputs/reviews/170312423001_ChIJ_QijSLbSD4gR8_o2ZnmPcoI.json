If you've ever had other Thai food in this city you can tell if the restaurant skimps on some of their ingredients when you order these dishes.  For example the beef in the Kao Soi we're not thin slices of skirt. The Pad Thai uses actual nuts instead of paste.  Expect an Western take of Thai flavors and you won't be disappointed.

The experience was both painful and funny as we attempted to get our food in the house. The delivery guy just could not figure out how to ring our bell. He could not even open our door after we buzzed him in several times. As we watched this comedy of errors through our video screen, he called us on his phone. I assumed this call would fix our problems but it turned into a task because the driver was speaking broken English. For a minute, I thought we might not get our food even though it was outside our front door.  After much direction, we finally got the delivery guy in and he delivered our food. We got crispy rolls with ground chicken and vermicelli. The dish was beautifully presented for delivery food. The rolls were sliced and topped with cilantro and carrots. They were good but the rolls could have used a dipping sauce on the side. That's an issue with delivery. Did we actually get everything for our dish.  We also ordered a hot and a mild version of Kee Mow Noodles with chicken, wide noodle, tomatoes, vegetables, carrots, onions, basil, bean sprouts and a sweet soy sauce. The dishes were good. I was very unhappy because my noodles were stuck together.  Again this can be a causality of delivery and this is why we avoid delivery always.  The dish was also a little too sweet for my taste buds. I like a true balance of flavors in my food.  I'd like to dine at thr restaurant and have the dishes served fresh. I will say that the delivery was fast and arrived earlier then promised including the drivers mishaps. We have not ordered delivery in over 10 years and it was nice to not go out in the freezing cold to get out food. I was also let down they didn't send any chop sticks. Asian food doesn't taste good to me with a plastic fork which is what they actually sent. Luckily I have a spare set of chop sticks in the house to enjoy my food. I'm ready for culinary emergencies.",

We ordered the scallops for appetizer, Pad Thai noodles with shrimp, and Kao Soi. I also ordered the Bangkok mule. The drink was delicious. The scallops dish was refreshing, and were cooked perfectly. The Pad Thai was very good too. However, the Kao Soi was very bland. We added chili sauce to it, but that didn't really help either. Our server was very friendly. I will be back to try more dishes.",

I asked the chef and sure enough, they serve bluefin tuna. Amazing! Get one of their signature rolls. The spicy scallop was outstanding. Extremely fresh and a perfect combination of flavors.

It aims for something a little more experimental or upcale than standard Thai fare, but the prices remain reasonable for what's offered. Atmosphere is a sort of rustic minimalism, but still cozy. I've dined here half a dozen times so far and always been satisfied. The Thai dishes have enough kick, ingredients taste fresh, and you can get authentic fish sauce on the side if you ask for it. The bar also serves an impressive cocktail menu.",

I'm baffled. Michelin Man, you got some splainin' to do. The food is mediocre and the service is bad. It used to be byob, that's over now, bummer. Forget about leftovers unless you dig wilty cabbage in every dish. It is cheap, so there's a positive.",

Ups for the crab rangoons, but the rest of the items I've tried here have been just awful and the service, slow. I doubt anyone would go here if there were any decent Thai options in the Wicker Park area. Yuck. Avoid- go to Argyle street, even though it's far away- there are frozen dinners better than this place.",
