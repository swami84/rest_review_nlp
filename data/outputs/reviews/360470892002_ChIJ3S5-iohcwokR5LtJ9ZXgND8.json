When I went in I saw a customer leaving and smiling so I said ok the service appears to be better. I said good morning, she didn't say greet me back. I continued to ask if she had ackee? The price? etc. I guess service depends on if they know you or maybe I asked too much questions but miss Lady was cold. Then she proceeded to scold me about the 10 dollar minimum for debit card. My total was 9.25. Listen, business is business. All needed to be said was 'just to let you know that there's a $10 minimum, your total is 9.25, would you like to add a beef patty with that to bring it up to the minimum?' Instead, it was attitude. In the entire transaction, there was not 1 'hello, good morning, what are you having?, thank you, Not 1 SMILE.  Golden Krust will always get business because you sell the foods that Jamaicans know and love and there's no denying that the food is good... But good customer service goes a long way.",

Never had a problem with any of the staff. When their is a long line expect to wait for service a bit longer than normal. Other than that never really had a problem with there food or anything else. This place no longer excepts debit and credit due to scammers.",
