But after spending any more than an hour there, or God forbid starting to play a second or third game, the staff makes it a very unwelcome environment if you aren't constantly ordering drinks AND food.  The game playing fee is very reasonable and I would have no problem with an hourly rate, but that is never advertised or expressed in any way. Instead they try to force you to get mediocre food off of a very limited menu. The worst part is the dismissive way that you are treated, despite some very helpful and kind staff members. 2 stars instead of only because of the few cool servers and not bad coffee.",

I had the sangria, my date had a Chai, we both ate some delicious sammies and they made it so easy for us to learn and pick games. Don't worry if you're not familiar with many board games because they'll also bring your a couple recommendations based off of the skill level and type of game you're into and they will also take the time to teach you. They're super friendly in their explanations and will even help if you get stuck along the way. Definitely was a great choice for the first date and many to come!  This is Chicago's first full service game cafe and we're super happy to have them in the neighborhood!",

Chicago's first full service and best board game cafe.  I was lucky enough to be at the launch party a few years ago, and am absolutely certain it was launched before sometime in 2020. Shame about the lack of integrity with some of the competition, Drew and Courtney have been engendering a movement in Chicago to really get this concept off the ground and encouraging others to do the same since 2014. It has been a real labor of love for them between starting a meetup group that ran for years at various establishments prior to finally securing their own place in 2017, and I'm glad to have been some small part of it.  That drama out of the way, The food is good for playing board games while chowing down, and delicious to boot. the atmosphere is fun and inviting, it's great spot to meet up with old friends over a delicious house blend coffee, or maybe meet some new friends over some of their interesting beer selections, I think everyone will have a great time either way.",

Our server was nice and still charged us the normal rate, but it left a bad impression of the business in my mind.

My son and I have been there three times when visiting Chicago and agree that if we lived in Chicago we'd be there every week.   Drew, Courtney, Leticia and the rest of the staff are great at teaching games, recommending games, helping people have fun with games, and making people feel welcome.   For veteran gamers (which my son and I are) it's a great place to try out and discover new games.  But the cafe is almost more aimed at casual gamers or even non-gamers -- it's dedicated to helping people discover and enjoy games as a form of social interaction.   Go there, go often, and support this gem of Chicago.  By the way it's very convenient to get to, just around the corner from the Belmont Red Line stop.   Brilliant.",

Overview: Nice space, great game library, poor customer service, very overpriced food.  The space itself is a very welcoming and inclusive space with gender-neutral bathrooms, a variety of sitting spaces and a surprisingly large game library with a great variety of games.  One of the initial draws of this cafe over other gaming places in Chicago is that the staff will give you recommendations of games and teach you at the table how to play the game. In my own experience though, I've never had an experience where the game has been explained well enough to just be able to play off what the staff has told me. They often gave the absolute basics and I would have to spend an additional like 20 minutes to go over the rules through the rule book which are in fairly poor condition or just missing in a few games. Now I understand that the staff don't have the time to explain all the intricacies of a game such as Root but even on a more basic game like Santorini, there were mechanics to the game which weren't explained well enough to make the game playable.  Another initial draw is that they have food and drinks available for purchase. The beverages are fairly well priced but the food is far too over priced. I ended up spending $9 for 4 very small quesadillas pieces this time and the previous time $8 for an about standard cereal bowl size of a sweet trail mix. For customers staying over an hour, they have a $15 per person minimum which the food will satisfy quickly but again, the size of the food isn't appropriate to the price.  Finally, the customer services could be improved some. While I understand that it was pretty crowded both times I was there, the staff was pretty sparse in checking up with us. It took a while for someone to came by to help us. Again, it was busy but after about 2 hours there, a different staff person came by to inform us that our customer minimum hadn't been met yet and we just hadn't planned yet to get something so needed a minute to decided on something else to get. After informing us, about 45 minutes passed and no one came by to check if we had decided on something which seemed odd given that they needed us to meet our minimum.",

I cannot speak highly enough of this place.  - The $5 per person table fee is ridiculously cheap considering the probable overhead of maintaining the 200+ board games they keep on a daily basis. - For that $5, you literally get a full-service experience. The staff will take your orders at the table, make recommendations for games to play based on your personal styles, and TEACH YOU THE GAMES IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THEM. I can't even imagine consistently remembering how to play so many different games! - The drinks and food are great, and pretty cheap for the quality. They have their own brand of coffee (Bonus Ground, hold for pun groans), and most of their alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are from local companies. On the weekends, they even have pie from Bang Bang Pie! - The staff are cognizant of the atmosphere in their establishment. You don't have to worry about large groups taking over the place and making it hard for you to enjoy your own game; the owners are quick to stop things from getting out of hand. - They also have a small retail section if you want to buy that game you just played and loved.  If you plan on coming consistently, get the membership. It pays for itself if you visit 3 times in a month.  The only customers who won't have a good time are the ones who aren't self-aware. While it has \"Cafe\" in the title (because of the kind of food/drinks they serve), it is closer to a restaurant because of the full-service nature of the business (how many coffee shops do you know that take & serve orders directly to your table?) So if you only order a single drink per person in 3 hours, you're probably going to be asked to leave like you would in a restaurant. If you consistently don't tip the waitstaff, they're going to notice and stop serving you. The $5 is a cover charge, not an all-inclusive fee. So when you read the negative reviews... that's probably the real story.  Overall, there are so many reasons why this place has become my favorite spot in the city. Really cool idea, excellent execution, knowledgable staff, large selection of games, and a great atmosphere for playing. A++!",

They are also rude whenever you ask them to find or explain a game for you. But last time was the worst. Me and my friends were kicked out for not giving enough tip in some coffees and chocolates. We are paying 5$ to play each time, and some of the friends are even paying a membership. Sometimes we order something just because they insist. But the main problem is not about the price or the need to order something policy. It is about the rudeness of the employees, who do never treat you well. I am paying to sit in a table and play, then why do I need to order every minute things I do not want. Make the membership more expensive or do whatever you want, but please treat your customers better. Never coming back. I forgot to say that some of the employees have been nice to us.",

This past month I have been going regularly (twice a week) to the place and gaming for two hours (sometimes just one game that lasts for that long), taking a coffe and paying the game fee which is 5 dollars (I would assume that it covers the time that you game but they do not think that way). Appart from many rude behaviours (not explaning games, or talking with all the lack of interest I've ever seen in a waiter) and many pushes to consume their food/drinks (pricey for what it is btw), yesterday we had one of the most embarassing situations I've seen in my life. The waiter came and said basically that he didn't want us to ever come back, that our tips wasn't good enough and he used some terms that made him go from rude to stirrer. I have to say that I always tip them with 15-20%, even being a student and I've tried to be as friendly as I could be, because I loved the place.  On the other hand, there are some members of the crew that are very friendly. But all in all, it is a place where you have to pay game fees + pricey drinks/food every two hours + outstanding tips (even getting terrible service sometimes) if you do not want to be kicked out. I will take the piece of advice of the waiter and never come back.",

Someone comes every ten minutes to ask if we want to order something else. We don't have time in ten minutes to finish what we already ordered.

(I have wanted to play this one bored game for a while and wanted to see if they had it.) When we went in my friend had to pee so she went to the bathroom while I looked at the games.  I was then approached by the owner asking if we were staying, I explained I was just looking at the games but would be out of her hair once my friend came out of the bathroom. She very rudely told me that I had to pay for my friend to pee. Quote \u201cyou can\u2019t just pee and use my stuff for free that\u2019s just like, common sense. You can not leave my store until you buy something.\u201d I apologized and said I must have missed the sign (there was no sign btw) she then told me off again saying it was common sense and how I was being so rude.  I apologized again and went to the register to buy something. I was told by another employee at the register that I was being so impolite by having my friend use the restroom.  For ignorant people like me and my friend that did not realize this place had a very strict \u201cno bathroom without purchase\u201d policy, I think it would be wise they put up a sign.  If the situation was handled with kindness and they politely infomed us all would be well and I would have likely came back. But unfortunately the place has left a very sour taste in my mouth :/",

Drew and Courtney (sp?) were so friendly, knowledgeable, and excited about us having the best experience possible. Not only is the gamin portion a blast, but we all had great drinks from the cafe.

Their knowledge of their games & ability to pick out the right mix of games to choose from based on a few questions **AND** get you up to speed on game play is freakin' amazing. Their sandwiches are tasty & snack options satisfying  & the desserts are all from some of the best local bakeries. They have a great mix of beers & wines as well as great coffee & espresso & omg try the specialty sodas.. they're SO good. Their Ladies & Non-Binary Nights are fantastic & the vibe in the place is inclusive & welcoming. They do all sorts of events, gaming & otherwise, so it's a great idea to check their calendar to see what's happening. They regularly have open gaming nights where you can even show up solo & meet some new friends. It's a small place so if you have plans for a group of more than 5 people, it's probably a good idea to call ahead to see how busy they are and/or make a reservation just so they're expecting you. And honestly, I didn't even realize it was something that needs to be said because Cafe is in the name... but don't bring in outside food and drinks. They serve food & drinks so that's just bad form.... call ahead if it's a special occasion.",

One, however, was very xenophobic and made the night very uncomfortable for my wife on her birthday. Ironically there is a sign that says no \"-isms\" allowed here. She was very rude to us about bringing a small cake and very rude to her about her foreign ID and wouldn't accept her US issued ID. She didn't have a problem with our cake until my wife showed an ID that basically identified her as an immigrant. She knew it was her birthday and was very rude to her while taking our order. She was very passive aggressive directly toward her even though I was the one talking to her. We were the only table with almost all people of color and were treated very differently by her compared to everyone else there. It left us feeling really poorly the rest of the night because she couldn't check her biases. We are board game enthusiasts and were really happy to see a place like this but really let down by how we were treated by this one person.",

For only $5 you get to sit as long as you want and play as many board games as you and your friends can handle. I went with a good friend, and both of us have experience with lots of different games, and the three they suggested to us were all games neither of us had tried before.  The owners are also super friendly, and they explain the rules to you for each game. It's really nice, because you know exactly what you're doing and don't have to fuss with the rulebook for 20 minutes to figure out how the game works.  The food is also really tasty, but it's fine if you don't order any too -- nice for those who just want a cheap evening playing games with friends.  I'll definitely be back and 100% recommend!",

All the staff members knew the games and could explain them really well.  They were able to suggest some really good games based on our strange whims (\"I want a time travel game!\"  - Temporum!,   \"I'd like to play something with pieces/non-traditional.\"  -The Climbers)  There were a bunch of different groups there; a family with a younger player, a couple of friend pairs, and our group was 5 people.  So there is something for everyone!  The food was also quite good, we had sandwiches which were very tasty (if this were near my work, I'd probably come here for the sandwiches on my lunch break.)  The sodas were quite tasty!  The only less than perfect thing was that they were out of pie. =<  Pies are delivered on Fridays.  >_>  I know when I am scheduling my next visit...

The cola float was awesome, and the game selection is impressive. $5 per person to learn a new game and play for the 3 hours we were there is a great deal. Worst thing that happens is that you don't like the game, and you get to pick another one, and it's still included in that $5.",

I love bringing my non-geeky friends here, because the owners are amazing at teaching and easing everyone into it, and they're really good at picking games based on what everyone's preferences.  Love coming here with my geeky friends as well.  There's just so many options for games here that you can find something for pretty much everyone.  The space is brightly lit, which is a must when you're looking for a place to play board games.  When I'm going to be playing for hours on end, it's a big deal to not have to squint and read in low lighting.  It sounds pricey to pay $5 per person every time, but honestly it's a great deal because I save so much from not having to buy any of these myself.  Overall, great addition to the neighborhood.  Would recommend anyone to check the place out regardless of whether you're into board games or not.",

The caf\u00e9 is open until midnight, so we stopped by after we finished sightseeing to wind down with beverages and board games. We visited on both a Saturday and Sunday evening\u2014our guests liked the first night so much they begged to return the next night!  Each night, the \"Game Guides\" did an excellent job making suggestions. (As a family, we were enthusiastic but not particularly knowledgeable\u2014we told the \"Game Guide\" what sort of games we liked to play and what we were hoping to do, and they brought us a small selection that we could easily chose from. We played multiple games each visit and enjoyed everything we played.) The fact that staff explain the games to you really took the pressure off.  We didn't try any food. We ordered a variety of coffee drinks, craft beers, and teas. Everyone was satisfied with their orders. Staff served us promptly and with no mix-ups.  Our guests are already looking forward to visiting Bonus Round the next time they're in Chicago, and we're sure we'll stop by again ourselves! (I've got my eye on the Bob Ross board game...) We had a wonderful time!",

Drew helped our group pick a game and explained all the rules to get us started - he was extremely helpful and we loved how enthusiastic he was about the game and about the cafe's success (we stumbled upon this place on their second weekend and it was booming the entire 3 hours we were there). They have a very wide and unique selection of board games, most of them we had never heard of. If you have a hard time picking one ask for suggestions - they know their stuff! Multiple times we had questions about the game rules and someone was always available to help. We had a great time and will definitely be back.

I also recommend coming with at least one friend because when I came around 10pm all people already had their own games set up.It seems to be a place to bring your own friends to play with vs just coming to play with other people. Plusses is this place has coffee and cafe food(sandwiches, soup). If you want a full bowl of soup dont order from this place because they give you a half bowl. I would not have noticed but either they need to change their portion sizes or give me a smaller bowl. The servers are great at suggesting games to play in addition to food. They also tell you how to play the games they recommend.So definitely worth the game pass cost.",
