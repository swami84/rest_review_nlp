For dinner we had primavera, pork special, swordfish and manicotti. Everything is homemade and fresh. The dressings were fabulous. The red sauce was so fresh you could taste the garden tomatoes. No canned tomatoes here. The owner Anthony stopped by our table and went over the specials with us in detail then went in the kitchen and cooked everything to order.",

They use local businesses for their meat, pasta (Milanos), and desserts (La Fiorintina).  Beyond that, the experience was terrible. The management was even worse. I called for reservations for a table of 9 and asked if they would be ok with kids to celebrate my birthday. The manager (or owner) said it was fine. We showed up just before our reservation time and were told that our table was given to another party (the restaurant was not full so we only waited a few minutes). We tried ordering the house red, but they were out (at 6:30 on a Saturday) and they offered us another Malbec. Except not at the $6/glass price (actually $7/glass but I guess the menu is wrong)...it took 25 minutes to get the drinks. Next, it took 25 minutes to order an appetizer and another 20 minutes to order our main. We did not get our main course until 1 hour and 50 minutes after sitting down. My wife's soup was cold, my mother's salad did not come with dressing on the side (both were corrected). At this point, I went to speak to the manager and he tried to explain away the mistakes on the server (\"she's only worked here 3 days) -- who leaves a new waitress alone, without help? (Again the restaurant has 7 tables of 20 full.) My mother's main came with the wrong pasta and she ordered another Malbec that was replaced with a red table wine. I tried leaving... But my wife had ordered canolis and 2 coffees... This took another 15 minutes to get to the table. The hostess came up as we were paying the bill to ask if everything was fine and we were honest that we were not satisfied... The manager came over again and insisted that it was not his fault... And then said \"it's hard getting out with kids\" ...eye roll. We said the food was great but service was not and walked out the door. He followed us out and suggested we try another Italian restaurant like Red Rose. Here's the thing, we've been here before and had good results and wanted Ciro's, not Red Rose. But this guy couldn't own up to his own and staffs faults. So, like he recommended to us, I pass to you: go to another Italian restaurant in the South End of Springfield. We will pass from now on and not recommend this place any more.",

Restaurant was a bit less than 50% full, drinks took awhile to get and all kitchen food was extremely slow.  Appetizers took at least 20 minutes to get, we had to ask where they were and was told kitchen was working on it now.  Though we said we did not want all food to come at same time, salads and dinner also took extremely long time.  All in all a 6:00 reservation where we sat at 6:15 (our fault) left the restaurant at 9:45. We watched at a table of 10 left prior to receiving their dinner as they had been there for 2 hours and hadn't received food yet.   If you're looking for a dinner night, way too long, if you're looking for an evening out, can do better with atmosphere and kitchen service.  Food was decent, though not worth the extensive delay.   Kitchen has a lot to learn.  Management/owner needs to pay attention or they will not survive.  Wouldn't recommend.",

While this was my first visit, there was a gentleman playing love music on a piano that I felt enhanced the experience. We were greeted by Anthony who, quite honestly provided some of the best service, as well as Kheagan, (forgive me if I misspelled his name) our waiter. Anthony has a passion about great Italian food and flavors and his mission is make sure you leave happy.  There is a bar area where there are 24 different taps if I remember correctly, and even an area where you can sit and look directly into the kitchen where you can see the great chefs prepare each meal.  We were seated and treated with fresh bread and oil, glasses of water, and orders were soon taken afterwards which included either a choice if soup or salad. I ordered the Chicken Parmagiana as my entree, and to my surprise, I was shocked, to great satisfaction at the sheer size of the portion/serving. The thing that impressed me most was the fact that the breading on the Chicken Parm still had that slight crunch instead of being \"soggy\" from the sauce that usually covers it. Both Anthony and Kheagan would come and check on us periodically to make sure everything was ok and believe me, things were fantastic.  This establishment is going to have a special \"Grand Opening\" on Tuesday,  August 14, with special live entertainment, with a new outdoor patio opening up as well. As for the experience and services received, I plan on continuing to return and support this business.",

Bartender, while she was courteous, was less than engaging or helpful in alternate selections. The back of the bar that's visible was a shambles, which visually maybe was an omen. Got to the table. Ordered appetizers and was given 2 free antipastos while we waited and waited for fried cheese and a salad. Neither met expectations. Very over cooked cheese and salad that had seen better days, fresh-wise. Ordered dinner and waited again. More free antipasto. Son's pasta arrived about 3 minutes premature of al dente (raw and tough), other half's gnocchi was either overcooked into paste or raw hard dumplings. My veal chop was raw. Not rare. Raw. One side had a semi browning to it. The other side was just grey. The potatoes and butternut squash sides were hard as rocks they were so undercooked. A side of broccoli rabe came 20 minutes into the meal and was in a dish with about 3/4 cup of olive oil. The waitress checked in now and then. The place was not hopping, especially for an early Saturday night.  The owner or manager ( we asked but the waitress demurred on which) was talking to guests and on his phone. The kitchen needs someone running it. Checking timing and quality of food coming out. It's a shame because we live VERY close by and was hoping that we had found a new hangout. We eat out routinely 2-3 times a week. While the decor is nice and the live jazz was incredible, the quality of food and service just won't bring us back. It's not an inexpensive place to dine, so the bar is a bit higher.  While we are dedicated to supporting small businesses - especially now that MGM will be calling the shots  -  Ciro's is a \"tradition\" that maybe should have stayed a memory.",

There was no one else in the whole resturant except our party of 4. Thursday night 630pm.  We were given a complementary antipasto,  which was yummy. Ordered the fried fontina cheese was a bit over cooked. Our dinners were good but not great. I ordered dessert , which was a canolli with a choice of blueberry or strawberry sauce ..they were out of sauce. Cancelled dessert. Drinks were a bit high $. service was slow but our waitress was very nice, and waiting for your food on a busy night,  that can be understandable but we were the only patrons.

My group tasted the eggplant rollatini and found it to be the best we had ever had.  The ambience of this restaurant is unusually pleasant, with lovely lighting and an open kitchen concept, full bar.  I highly recommend it.",
