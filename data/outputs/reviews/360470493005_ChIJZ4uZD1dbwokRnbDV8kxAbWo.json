Anyways, the entire container was about the size of my fist (my fist is normal womanly sized). The rice included was clearly just sitting in the pot for a while cause it was dry. This was around 8/9pm so perhaps they just thought they could give me whatever leftovers and I would be fine with it? Wrong!  Stew wasn\u2019t even that good. Def not worth the almost $25 I paid for it. I was still hungry after!",
