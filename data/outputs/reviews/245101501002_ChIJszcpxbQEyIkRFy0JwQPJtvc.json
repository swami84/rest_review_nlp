Not only did I not see this but it was needed as there was a man highly intoxicated prior to entering and was harassing women and invading personal space. I had to move my table to get away from him, and his rowdy table guest. And he continued to do so to other female patrons. Ummm manager where? No where \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

My husband and I did not order anything so the waitress went to the manager and she came back  to the table and told us that we had to spend at least $20 per person.  I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came to the table with a nasty disposition. She told us that it should be understood that we were to pay for food/drinks because it is a business. There was no apology for the miscommunication. Also, there was no sineage to show this so called policy. Spending the money was not the issue. The issue was that the hostess or waitress did not communicate the policy of the business.",

After all of the fees, the value of the Groupon is reduced even though you pay one price thinking you're getting what was listed.  And you do not get 2 entrees up to $42.00 value; it's $10 per person and you pay the difference of each meal at the end.  We didn't discover the overcharge until we checked our bank account the next day.  We called to speak with a manager and Henrietta came on the line stating she was a manager but was unable to assist with any adjustments.  She continued to repeat how the 18% is charged because people tend not to tip most times.  We totally understand that but we tipped and was still charged 3 different fees.  She said the manager on duty the day of our visit which apparently was a ghost manager would call us back but we never got a call.  She also said we could come in person to see if the other manager would give us a refund but it would have to be in cash and not on our card.  We asked that the card that we used be credited she said no because most likely we wouldn't get a refund and that we would have to speak with the other manager in person.  Poor customer service and an inconvenience to the customer.",

I was told that I could only get 3 entree  and 3 drinks if I decided to use it and I that I would have to forfeit the 4th meal and drink. I asked if I could just get the 4th entree to go. I even said that I don't need the 4th alcoholic drink. I actually only needed 2 of the alcoholic drinks as one of the individuals who was with me was my daughter who is 8 months pregnant, and she certainly was not drinking... I get that 1 person was not with me, but I did not see any harm in just them letting us take the 4th meal with us to go. I just decided to get up and leave. it did not help that the young lady who sat us was not at all cheerful, she had a very blah attitude... Might try again in the future or I will see if my Groupon is refundable...",

So this time I decided to get a Groupon and go on a Saturday evening... Never again will I do that. 1. My food was late and the seafood was over cooked. 2. My drinks took forever to come. 3. The waitress that we had service was terrible. Never checked on us and I had to constantly look for her. 4. Then to top it off the Groupon mentioned with \u201cgreat service should cause for a generous tip.\u201d Although, being a past restaurant manager I feel the same, but in this case my husband and I received terrible service. So I felt that she shouldn\u2019t have been tipped $20 but the waitress felt to add the gratuity from our grand total instead of our actual service. Not saying that I wouldn\u2019t have tipped her but I feel like I tip is based off great service. Now the other server I saw was amazing, on point constantly, and checked in periodically as a great server should..  If you want better service go during the day.!!!",

I had the jerk chicken  pasta, which was spicy  but excellent. My husband had jerk chicken, black beans, rice and peas and plantains, which were all delicious.  And the drinks were phenomenal! !!  The Calibar rum punch taste  just  like  Jamaica!!! I will definitely  go back!!!",

We live in Decatur so it\u2019s not always available on the app, but when it is we have to order it. We\u2019ve tried the shrimp & grits, surf and turf, oxtails, and salmon with sweet patotato hash and spinach. All great, even the desserts. The staff are also friendly. When they are out of something they will call you for substitutions and make recommendations. I highly recommend this place. We just ordered again today and plan on visiting in person sometime very soon.",

We stated the band came behind us and is bringing in their equipment and so she agreed and took us to our seat. Then she proceeded to come back 3 minutes later to state she think she needed to ask her manager if we had to pay.

Long story short our total came up to $60 which we had a Groupon for $71 worth of food. We were charge $10.80 for a \u201cservice fee\u201d. Which no one could explain to us why we were being charged if our Groupon pay for for the meal. I just think it\u2019s a scam in you should be warned if using a Groupon. then the waitress tried to tell us that she told us in the beginning  that there was a service charge for using it. The waitress never  didn\u2019t tell us and it was not in their groupon fine print purchase. Then she tried to say it was gratuity which it was horrible service .we had to wait 30 minutes for boxes while she was talking to other waitresses at the front door.
