I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to have caught up with this place during some down time.  Getting to the point, this is where you need to be if you are craving some nostalgic comfort food. Coming from a true fan of Chinese fried rice I wouldn't mind recommending this spot for the downtown Chicago area.  One piece of advice is to maybe hold the veggies on ya order if your not a fan of full size cut veggies and not the lil chopped pieces you see in pandas rice.  Also that chicken and sauce fye as hell boi, lol! #MarqWasHere",

I've eaten here over 10 times now and I can definitely say their wings are their best offering, though they're way too expensive for the portion size.  The Bao are next in line for me, but they're very hit or miss -- for instance, my favorite Bao they offer is the pork belly bao, but at least 1/3 of the time, the taste is off and it's far too salty.  Their \"street bowls\" are awful, in my opinion.  Every one I've had, no matter which sauce I selected, tasted pretty much the same.  I believe this is in part due to using the same cooking pans with minimal to no cleaning between cooking different bowls.  Every single one had a taste of their Szechuan sauce, which I strongly feel is not a good flavor.  I'm a Louisiana native with Cajun blood who's a HUGE fan of spicy food too, so coming from me, that's saying a lot.  Overall, I would never suggest eating here, but if you choose to, I'd strongly advise sticking to the wings and/or bao.  There are plenty of better options around however, especially with the French Market 1 block away.  Despite saying it's \"middle-of-the-road,\" I'm giving it 2 stars for pricing vs. portion size vs. quality of food; as many other reviews state, the portion sizes definitely don't seem to match the pricing.  I believe that applies to every item on their menu.",

I tried the MSG wings(next time I will ask for them to be cooked for about 1-2 mins longer so they are crisper like I like) and my husband tried the Street Bowl with jasmine rice and chicken.  It was great for him because it did not have egg.  The wait time was minimal and the food was hot and right from the grill.  I will be adding this to the list of restaurants for lunch.",
