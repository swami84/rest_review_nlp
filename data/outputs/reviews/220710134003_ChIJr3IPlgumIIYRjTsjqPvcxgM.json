When we arrived, there was live jazz playing which was nice but a bit loud for us. We asked if we can be seated in the back of the restaurant so it would be a bit quiet. Immediately the waiter had an attitude as he seated us. I brushed it off and pretended that it was not there. Then when we ordered, there was the attitude again, for no reason. We only wanted to try the gumbo because it's well talked about on the restaurant's reviews. No matter what we ordered we shouldn't have been treated that way. The waiter said that's it very sarcastic and with a tone. I also order some beignets and was not sure if the lady who took the order heard me. When the waiter who was tall slim African American guy came back I asked him about the beignets. He rudely replied, \" didnt you ask for them already?\" That's when I said ok what's the problem and why do you have an attitude. He proceeded to lie and said he didn't.  That's when my friend said yes you do. He started walking up to our table so we stood up. You dont walk up to people in a hostle manner. Then he starts getting in my face when I kept telling him he has a tone. He got in my friends face so I had to step in the middle. The waiter told us if we wanna fight him on his job! Like really? This is the service you get for supposedly great food? The whole situation was crazy. We didn't get to try any of the food. We ended up leaving and speaking to the manager who applogied and asked us to stay. Who will stay after that. And it looked like he was the only waiter in that section. My friend didnt want to be in the same space as him we left but before we did, manager gave us a cup of Hennessy to go.",

The lobby is one of my favorites during the holidays with a golden tree, branches/vines sprawling and covering the ceiling and glass ornaments dangling.  This year they have a gingerbread streetcar with seriously beautiful detail!  The courtyard is also decked out with holiday lights and cheer, and is a lovely spot to sit/sip with friends.",

The restaurant shares the same space as the Davenport Lounge, and with the right seat, you\u2019ll still have a great view of Jeremy Davenport and the band performing. The service was impeccable! We were provided with complimentary bread (cornbread and rolls). They were both good. I started with a drink, the 1718 Tricentennial. It was amazing and ironically cost $17.18 lol. We both ordered the pork chop stuffed with boudin, covered with a mustard green gravy and accompanied by sweet potatoes. It was good, but I was still hungry afterwards. So mental note, order more food the next time! We tried the red velvet doberge and bread pudding for desert. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the doberge cake, but the bread pudding was quite unique. If you want a relaxing evening, good service and great live music, then definitely give M Bistro a try. By the way, the gumbo is amazing! We were able to sample some before entering the restaurant...it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve had In NOLA! I\u2019ll certainly be back!",

Our server told us we had to have one check split evenly - which is fine but I think they did it because they get a 18% gratitude . So by that time, why even try to do your job. I asked about recommendations on drinks and they rudely responded \"don't know I drink Henny\" are your serious? That's your response? To top it off as the most outrageous stunt in history ... They swiped my card three times and charged me $200 on a $50 bill. If that doesn't scream shady I don't what does. Asked management and they said no it doesn't stay. Well it did . 4 days later all transactions cleared. I had to  my bank and dispute because I NEVER approved that.  Stay far away. It's a scam at this restaurant and it's so disappointing to be connected with such a high level named hotel",

The food was the biggest surprise though, it was very tasty, like the chefs paid a lot of attention to the details; I experienced some new and unique flavours to go with my pork chop, and it was a large serving of meat with very little fat or gristle. A good cut. A surprisingly great price too. I spent $200 on the fancy bourbon though, the pork chop was only 30 dollars.",

While we were waiting they waiter brought fresh jalapeno bread and accommodated a request by my mother for bread with no jalapenos.  They also brought sample size dishes of seafood gumbo.  Quite literally the best gumbo I have ever tasted.  They brought out the main course and when I cut into my steak it was quite raw and I had asked for medium.  I had barely cut open my steak when a waiter stopped and asked what was wrong.  He immediately scooped up my plate and apologized.  The next thing I knew  had a crab and shrimp cocktail in front of me which was quite delicious.  I quickly had my meal returned to me and it was perfection.  We finished off the meal with key lime pie and carrot cake with blood orange sorbet.  The desserts were excellent.  I loved the sorbet the best!  The menu was quite pricy.  It cost $15 to add 1 crab cake to my meal but you get what you pay for.  I was reading the menu online and they only use the freshest in season ingredients and follow a farm to table philosophy which was much appreciated.  All in all an EXCELLENT experience that I would highly recommend to other diners.  Bon Appetit'!!",
