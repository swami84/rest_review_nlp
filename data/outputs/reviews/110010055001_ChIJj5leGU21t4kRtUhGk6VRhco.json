But again, it had a wonderful flavor so that didn't matter. Finally, I got the foul mudammas which was tasty but also not what I'm used to. This foul seemed more tomato based. The one I'm used to has more of a garlic and tahini kind of sauce. I think I was expecting more of a Lebanese style to the food so that was more on me for expecting something other than what was on offer. But, all in all it was delicious and I would eat there again and just ask for more garlic. Also, the staff were friendly and the restaurant looks clean which is important.",
