What is the point of having a reservation system if you\u2019re going to prioritize based on arrival?  Service: The restaurant was relatively busy so perhaps that will account for how long the food took to arrive. However, when our entrees came in one of my companions received the wrong side order, and somehow they sent an extra entree no one ordered.  Food: I will say that since this is a fusion restaurant, you shouldn\u2019t expect the flavors to match what you would expect to see in a traditional Latin place. That aside it wasn\u2019t bad. I ordered a beef and sweet plantain mofongo, which was absolutely delicious.  One of my companions did say that the rice tasted pre-packaged.  Overall: The food is not bad and the overall atmosphere is also quite nice. However, at the price point I do expect service to be much better than it was.",

The only reason why it didn\u2019t receive 5 stars was because of the server we had. Food came out ALMOST 2 hours after we ordered, Jaziel I believe Was his name, he was rude, short with his responses and he showed his attitude in his face, noticed him walking off shaking his head a couple of times. We complained not 1 time during our visit. Nothing rude was said to him, and he was tipped accordingly. One thing that can ruin restaurants reputation is having the wrong people in place. If I return, I\u2019d sit at the bar or make sure he is not the server. I\u2019m hoping he was just 1 bad apple and not all servers act that way.",

If you're familiar with the neighborhood, you'll see mechanic shops all over, the police precinct across the street and the traffic leading to and from the highway, drive around the back streets to find parking. Once you walk in, it feels like you left the neighborhood into a Miamiesq scene. Nice decor, cool ambiance, large TV screens showing the game's, a live dj and pretty good food and drinks. It wasn't too busy, maybe needs more marketing or I went on the wrong night (Friday night 4 weeks ago) but everyone was very professional, the vibe was chill  and I'd definitely go back, hopefully I'll catch it on a busier night to get a better gauge of the place.",

She requested the VIP area after assuming it would be the best area in the restaurant, it was not.  The VIP was in a hot corner upstairs.  The tables for 14 people were set in an \"L\" shape, which lead to some giving their backs to others in our party.  The space was extremely warm, not a single piece of decor on the walls.  Unfortunately, we went for a prefix menu below, $55 each for a 2 course meal, 1 hour sangria.  The appetizers were wings and Asian guacamole w/wonton chip,  we should've known better.  Guacamole belongs to Mexico not any Asian, it was inedible.  Extremely salty, brownish in color, with sesame seeds and who knows what other sacrilege.  The wings were good, but definitely not enough for 14 guests.  The main course options were limited.  Most of the table ordered the churrasco, afterall Chile Rellendo ($16 on their regular menu) would not have been a smart choice.  The churrasco was way too chewy and nothing special.  One hour drinks for $20 was ok, but you probably won't be able to order more than 2 glasses in an hour unless you chug.  The busboys were extremely slow to pick up plates, we had to ask several times for our appetizer plates to be picked up.  Last shocker, the waitress offered to cut a small cake the birthday had to share with her guest, of course we took the offer.  They charged us $20 without informing there was a cake cutting fee, that's a first!  Very sneaky, had we known we would have cut our own cake!  Truly disappointed.  They place may be nice inside but their food and service left little to desire.",

Although not a staple on their menu ask for the monfungo made with bacon &  chorizo top with cheese & accompanied with garlic sauce! They also have a  sushi & raw a couple of times during the week and they recently added a dessert menu! The staff are friendly and welcoming. Beautiful decor and art work from different local artist are display thru out the entire place. Live talented musical artists perform almost every evening.  A lovely place to dine with a couple of friends or family or a date.  This is definitely hidden gem in the heart of the Bronx!",

This restaurant is probably as good as some of the ones in downtown Manhattan, but is way cooler because it lives in the boogie down Bronx. The food was absolutely spectacular! All of it was fresh and delicious. And the industrial yet classy decor, along with the glowing bar and trumpet chandelier, every single detail of presentation was impeccable. And the service, no contest, one of the best I've experienced. I would definitely come back and would highly recommend this gem of a restaurant in the South Bronx.",

His customer service skills go beyond his job description to make sure everything is that way you want it to be. The restaurant has a very nice modern decor with 3 floors of seating area. Happy hour on Friday has a very nice selection of drinks. We did order two drinks which we had to send back, but our server made sure it was done right both times for a great dinning/drinking experience. I ordered a churrasco medium, but it was actually medium well and it was cut before it was served. I prefer to cut my own stake as it preserve the meat juice. This cause the stake to be a bit dry for me. However, the overall experience was phenomenal. I do plan on going back soon to explore other things from the menu.  If you are a bourbon fan, they do have a great bourbon and other whiskey selection which is hard to find around this area. Another plus is that there was no hookah smoking while we ate/drank here. #bourbon #suyo #drinks #food #bar",

The staff needs serious training you can not have an amazing place and lack staff it just does not fit. We had appetizers and wine. The food is tasty unfortunately our waiter lacked manners, professionalism and knowledge of the brand he is working for. Flirted with my girl, never came around to see if we were ok. From a distance winking at  my girl and just poor demeanor. Once we paid the bill my girlfriend wanted to sit at the bar and try a signature cocktail. We ordered Sangria she paid the bill at the bar. About ten minutes into our conversation a bill was placed in front of us. She was puzzled because she had paid already. As we approach one of the Bar tenders  he states \" We did not pay the bill\" my girlfriend tells him \"Yes, I did please confirm\" he comes back and tells me you did not tip the waiter my mouth dropped. Tipping is at once discretion. How tacky and uncouthed of the staff to do that. He did not deserve a tip coming from Manhattan we know about tipping however my girlfriend did tip the bartender. They were insisting we did not pay at this point we are feeling humiliated and upset. My girlfriend       walks over to the Bar Manager explains the situation still its like no comprehension on customer service. She was upset,music was loud do the voice tones were high. Here comes security asking if all was ok. Trying to get our point across the bar tender decides to remove our drinks we paid for. Are you kidding me?  Here we are trying to justify this mess they created then another security guy chimes in making it worse. My girlfriend just wanted to get a point across about tipping, customer service, the treatment they were giving us mind you we were not drunk nor tipsy we are not heavy drinkers. They were trying with that card as they noticed we were not.  I asked why the drink was taken away, they tried to charge us twice for the Sangria insisting we did not pay all because of the not leaving a tip. We suggested check your security cameras. To boot my girlfriend just wanted to sit and have the Sangria, they were willing to serve it after 20 mins explaining the situation and why were we being treated poorly like criminals. The second security guard told her You can't sit at the bar. Really? That's where we said this is just a nasty place never again will we go or recommend. As my gf told him I sit where I please I paid my bill. How dare you tell a customer that. TRAIN YOUR STAFF YOUR SHELL LOOKS AMAZING BUT YOUR INSIDE LACKS ALOT. SAD...",

The selection on the menu from the appetizers to the main course were great so we opted of taking 7 from the appetizers. They were all great - of course with drinks of beer, wine, pisco sour and this smoked old fashioned whiskey. Was able to chat with the people from the kitchen, runners, waiters, managers, owners and baristas and they were all effin' cool!  And oh, the ambiance and the bar...awesome!!",

What I do like are the cocktails, the ambiance and sometimes the prices. Even though I snacked on a few things I wouldn't exactly say that the food was memorable. My experience here was solely based on my interactions at the bar. There are some rare- to-find spirits here and the staff puts in the effort to get those stars up beyond the 4.0 mark. If you want to make the trip up to the BX, go right ahead, it's worth it.",
