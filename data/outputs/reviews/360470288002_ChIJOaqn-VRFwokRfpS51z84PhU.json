For the poke bowls, you have the option of either rice, brown rice, salad lettuce or zucchini noodles as a base for your bowl and then a protein for the bowl (extra proteins would add some additional cost to the total). The proteins include salmon, tuna, shrimp, chicken, tofu, eel, and some others that I forgot \ud83d\ude05. The other toppings and the sauce are unlimited where u add as much as u want. They put the bowl together right in front of you as u choose the toppings (it's like getting a subway sandwich). This I really like because the process is very quick for my short lunch break. \ud83d\udc4d The seating in the store is very nice too. Very spacious and alot of tables around and in the back. You can come here to do work  since it's not very loud most of the time. Other than that, in my opinion, this location of pokebowl station is better than the one on 7th ave... I feel like the portion of the bowls is bigger here... and more worth the price of the overall bowl. \ud83d\ude2c",

But yesterday I was a quite disappointed by the service. First of all, usually they deliver within 20-30 minutes. I waited my order about 1 hour and 10 minutes. When I finally received my bowl it was freezing cold. You can not just hit it in microwave bcs it contains vegetables, salmon etc inside. So, i had to call them to ask refund and return my order. After a few minutes of arguing the company decided to give me one more the same free poke bowl. Actually, I'm still a little upset about what happened, but this happened for the first time and the company reacted very worthily.  P.S. Unfortunately I have to update my last review and score for this horrible place. One more chance was given and I ordered the poke bowl one more time just a couple weeks ago. Almost 1 hour and 25 minutes (1,5 hour, Karl!) waiting, almost 20 dollars and completely freezing cold meal was delivered! Also, didn't understand why so much vinegar in the rice? For what? So, one more very frustrating experience. Bravo, guys, keep moving. For sure it was last time in this place. Thank you!",

I don't like cooked fish but I really like sushi, fresh sushi. Not into fishy fish and was afraid that this Chipotle style poke bowl would be weird. I finally tried it tonight and it's delicious. Tuna, spicy tuna, corn, mango, avocado, cilantro, pok\u00e9 special sauce and onion crisps. Fish was very fresh and plenty of toppings and sauces to choose from. They aren't cheap with the amount of sushi they add either. Im down to a few bites and there's still sushi to eat. They have pre made bowls, poke tacos and ice cream and stuff which all look good. Great post workout meal with all fresh tasty ingredients. Will def be coming back \ud83d\udcaf",

Unfortunately, I never got a chance to try it... until now.  This place is hip, it's modern, it's delicious, it's fresh- all at reasonable prices. I had the rice bowl with spicy tuna and spicy salmon. Great taste. My friend had tuna and chicken, which he really enjoyed. The toppings are free of charge and there are so many options, but the flavors really meld together in the final product. We shared the purple mountain shaved ice bowl for dessert. It is to die for- crunchy from the fruit loops, juicy from the popping boba, tart from the strawberries, and sweet from the taro shaved ice. Again, so many flavors, so many toppings, so many combinations.  I 100% recommend this place. The interior is tastefully decorated, and the food is excellent.",

For a cup of instant black coffee, the clerk politely told me to wait about four minutes, and recommended an original omelet (the favorite of the beautiful clerk!). Black coffee has a sweet and bitter taste in the mouth. There is a nostalgia for herbal tea. It has the smell of roasted coffee and charcoal. The inconspicuous sourness brings out the subtle change of sweetness and bitterness on the tip of the tongue. It seems to be lightly telling the beauty of bitterness and sweetness. The oil of coffee lubricates the bitter and sweet mouth, with a quiet aftertaste of sweetness. The original egg pie is a sweet egg product. The outer skin is made of iron molds. The softness of the cake is inside, and there is a hint of nostalgia. It is the taste of the staff baking with confidence. This shop is good.
