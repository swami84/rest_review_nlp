With that in mind, the food is very tasty - they have standard lunch fare staples like sandwiches and bagged chips and a soup of the day each day. They also have dumplings served with rice. There are a small, but decent number of vegetarian choices (including some very tasty vegetarian dumplings) and a veggie wrap that is vegan.",
