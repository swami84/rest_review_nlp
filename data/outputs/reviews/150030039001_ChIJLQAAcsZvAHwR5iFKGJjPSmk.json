I saw a review saying that the sugar content is not too sweet, so I tried to order with reference to it, but it was moderately sweet.  I added konjac to the mango mojito, but it matched the refreshing mojito and was very delicious! The brown sugar tapioca milk was a little lukewarm because it puts warm tapioca in it, but it was mochi mochi because it was warm tapioca! (If you can make a lot of ice, it will be delicious)  The clerk who received the order was very kind \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb There was also a Japanese menu.

I had a cheese foam topped peachy smoothie which is super refreshing and creamy too adding the cheesy top. However, if you are not a fun of the sweet and savory contrast in your smoothie, try their milk tea instead - my mom didn\u2019t care much for the cheesy top, but she would definitely go again for the traditional milk tea. It\u2019s well balanced with the sweetness of the milk and fragrance of the tea - just like the one you would taste in Hong Kong, but in a much more refined version. Price wise... it\u2019s on the pricier end, but being at Kakaako, decorated with the most modern and beautiful decor (they prob had an interior designer do it professionally), using very good quality and stylish material for the drinks, I say they price like any smart business person would. A plus, the photo opportunity... haha any drink you order it\u2019s an art. Adding the backdrop of their cute little shop - what else do you ask for when you enjoy the drink while having hundreds (if not thousands) of your friends envy you at the same time?!! Love love love this place. I\u2019d go every chance I have when I\u2019m in the area. Oh, btw, they validate a hour of parking too when you park at Hmart next door.",

My girlfriend and I went to the shop on a Tuesday afternoon. When we first enter the shop it seems very fresh and clean since they recently opened. Me and my girlfriend were so excited to try this place out since we heard so much good things about it but the result was such a disappointed. I know this may not seem important to other people but during this pandemic time cleanliness are something we should pay close attention to. When we were waiting in line we notice some customers in front paid cash for their drink. Then the cashier received the she cash went straight to help making drinks without washing or sanitizing her hands. This should of been the first sign that we should of leave. The ordering process was smooth and we got our drink reletively quick. The drinks were comparatively expensive not sure if it is because of their location.  We ordered two drinks and it cost about 20 dollars that's crazy!!!  The drinks looks nice however let me tell you it definitely not worth the price. With the fruit oolong tea I can taste that they use fruit Jam and mixed with water. For the mango smoogurt too it taste like mango juice not fresh mango that they claim. Both drinks were a total disappointment. The value of the drinks does not match with the price. This may probably be the only time we will be coming to this place. Please do not use fruit juice or jams and advertise as \" fresh fruit\". If you are by the area don't care about the taste and have a lot of cash in hand please do try this place out.",
