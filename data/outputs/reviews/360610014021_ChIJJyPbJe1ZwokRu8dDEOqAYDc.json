As someone who has eaten at plenty of mediocre-generic Indian restaurants (that I can only assume are incredibly Americanized), Dhamaka is a breath of fresh air.  Every dish we ate had unique and incredible flavors. The same can be said for the drinks.  I will say, my partner and I aren't used to eating spicey foods. Some of the dishes came right up to the edge of our tolerable spice levels, but never went overboard. If you can't handle heat at all, I'd recommend you ask which dishes are on the milder side. If you're up for it, I'd highly recommend ignoring this advice as the spice complimented the flavors well.  The staff were friendly, as well as the owner who checked in and gave us some background into the origins of the food.  Lastly, the ambiance felt sophisticated yet fun and joyful. Great place for a nice dinner.",

The highlight was the paplet fry appetizer and champaran meat entree. Kudos to the chef the food is brilliant. The owner stopped by our table multiple times which I appreciated \u2014 made us feel so welcome and joked we could eat the fish with our hands \u2014 small things like this are what stands out.

Knowing that Dhamaka is the latest venture started by Owner Roni Majumdar and Executive Chef Chintan Pandya after Rahi and Adda, me and my wife were pretty excited to try it out. High expectations seldom match the experience. We were so glad Dhamaka lived up to the expectations, and more. The menu items are limited, however there are no side actors here. Each and every menu item is a star in its own. My wife being a pure vegetarian, tried Beguni, Bharela Marcha, Paneer Methi, Chapati, Paratha and Kesari Anjeer. You can't go wrong with any. Although, special mention for Beguni and the Bharela Marcha, we had never tried it and regretted wasting our life till now. The Paneer Methi is directly server in the pan in which it's cooked, it's delicious. I tried the Paplet fry, Goat belly seekh served on little cylindrical grill, and Champaran meat which is basically the best mutton you will ever experience. The Chef told us that Champaran meat will be limited availability, served on first ordered first served basis, so ensure that you order it first if you are interested. Add all this wizardry to the great conversation with Roni and Chef Chintan, we had a wonderful wonderful time. Thanks Team Dhamaka \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

Something that we have been yearning for a long time - a high quality Indian restaurant showcasing the diversity of India's regional cuisine, not typically seen in Indian restaurants in US. Chef Chintan Pandya and restaurateur Roni Mazumdar have totally hit it out of the park!!  First day, first seating! We were fortunate to have an opportunity to experience the exceptional cuisine and warm hospitality of Chef Chintan and his team. - Loved the Joshila cocktail - perfect blend of mezcal, green chili & passion fruit. Paan-E-Bahar could benefit from some more ginger liquer. - Each regional dish was perfectly executed, and authentic in its flavors. We covered quite a spectrum: Bharela Marcha (Gujarat), Paplet (Mumbai/Goa), Doh Khleh (Meghalaya), Goat Belly Seekh, Champaran Mutton (Bihar), Macher Jhol (Bengal), and Chena Poda (Odisha). - Champaran Mutton stood out as the signature dish. Marinated for 24 hrs, and slow cooked in an earthen pot for 4 hrs. We had always thought of goat meat as mutton, but Chef Chintan was very kind to explain to us that mutton is from a 3 yr old sheep. With the decline of wool industry, older sheep are hard to find - so the mutton is sourced from Arizona and flown in fresh. It was cooked beautifully - with the smoky flavor of mustard oil, well balanced with the sweetness of a whole bulb of garlic.  Dhamaka has arrived with a bang! We would highly recommend Dhamaka to anyone who wants to experience the amazing flavors that regional Indian cuisine has to offer. The high quality ingredients, balanced flavors, and the famous Indian hospitality truly shines in this restaurant.",
