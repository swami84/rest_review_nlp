For $10 per small bowl I thought I would get actual rice noodles and broth with some complexity. Instead I received swollen, overcooked spaghetti in canned beef broth.

I would love to see a heat scale on their menu so you'd know ahead of ordering.  They are very willing to adjust the seasoning when you order as well. We also ordered the handmade noodles in our soup which were delicious. My only other suggestion is just a personal preference . There were alot of noodles but I would have liked a little more vegetable in my soup. All in all I would highly recommend.",

My boyfriend and I braved a snow squall and walked there; as we entered, shaking off the snow, a woman immediately greeted us and offered us a table and some hot tea (free) to warm us up.  The tea was warm and delicious - a barley tea that warmed us right up. They offer a bayberry tea as well for a price that I'll try on my next visit.  We shared the Asian Cucumber Salad with a Sweet'n'Sour sauce to begin. It was bright, crisp, and delicious - a lovely contrast to the miserable weather outside. They offer a spicy alternative as well.  We both ordered the ZhaJiang (sp?) noodles with tofu for our meal. We stuck with the normal noodles for our first time, but next time we'll spring for the homemade noodles (at an additional cost).  Our food came promptly and was delicious. The serving size was incredibly generous (I took half home as leftovers!). The noodles were coated in a slightly sweet and savory sauce, topped with peas, carrots, corn, and cilantro (we thought the flavors were slightly reminiscent of banh mi).  I have a few observations/suggestions that are keeping from 5 full stars, but these are just comments for a new business. I fully intend to become a regular customer at Yummi Noodle.  All in all, I highly recommend Yummi Noodle. I'll definitely be going back to sample more items off their menu (or calling ahead, as they do takeout!)",
