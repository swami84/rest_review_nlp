My husband frequently does this which annoys me as well. He frequently accuses me of code switching in Jamaican restaurants. But this jerk shop is worth it.

Everything was fantastic, the rasta pasta was a pleasant surprise. I mean, it was really great- next time I will have the fish deboned.  Also had the chili wings and the mac & cheese- delicious.  When I come back I'm going for the oxtail. Good place, great people.  Note- I had bought \"medium\", and there's leftovers for today. Big portions.  Did I mention that they were nice and helpful?

I walked into Jerk House and the smell as soon as I walked in was amazing. The food looked fresh. The staff was so inviting and nice. I decided on a Shrimp Platter with Cabbage and Sweet Plantains and a side order of Jerk Chicken. Im surprise I didnt see a foot in my food because someone sure put their foot in it. The shrimp has so much flavor, cabbage was fresh sweet plantains was sweet and not dry and the jerk chicken was so full of flavor and juicy. Yup, I will be back. I live in the Bronx but I dont mind traveling for good food and good service. Thank you! Support these businesses especially during these times!",

The Mac and Cheese was the best I\u2019ve had in years and the chicken was moist and tasty!!! Paid $14.50 including tax ($3 more for Mac and cheese medium size plate compared to peas and rice).  Worth every penny; the takeout meal fed two.  Can\u2019t wait to go back again!!!!!!",

Not enough to fit in the plastic section for a side. Just sad how the cabbage was not even a fork full in the container.",
