She had excellent knowledge of menu and was able to pair wine perfectly with our orders. There was a small issue with our food that she worked quickly and efficiently to fix. Overall wonderful experience. The staff made sure that our special night was enjoyed to the max extent possible. Wonderful service and food.",

Our server was amazing - Amy was very sweet and attentive.  My husband had the spicy angel hair pasta. I had a custom baked rigatoni dish that was enough for two meals easy. Both were great. I would call the cuisine more American - Italian food versus authentic but still yummy.  The only thing I wish had been different is their shrimp. Being a mile away from the gulf we were very disappointed that the restaurant doesn\u2019t source locally and uses farm raised shrimp. Because of that we wouldn\u2019t order the shrimp and stuck with vegetarian dishes. I think that is a big area for improvement. We are from Michigan and can get farm raised shrimp there. Charge the extra $1 or $2 for the good stuff - I promise people will pay it!!",

After reminding her of the bottle she admitted to have forgotten, we didn\u2019t receive the bottle until much later, and after opening the bottle and pouring us all a glass she asked if we needed boxes and proceeded to give us the check...as if this wasn\u2019t bad enough we asked her two more times for more waters while we drank the wine we were supposed to get with the meal and we never got it. After reminding her the third time she admitted she forgot the water but once she had taken payment we never saw her again.

Even though we did not have reservations, we were early so they were able to seat us. The service provided by Amy was outstanding. She was very attentive and super friendly. The owner also greeted us and ask us if our meal was satisfactory. He also spoke to us about his Italian ancestry. He was very cordial and friendly. All in all it was a great evening meal. Highly recommend!!",

The staff were very nice and welcoming and the owner Joey even introduced himself after I told the hostess that I came here from a suggestion from a passenger on my flight during my work trip.  If you want an absolute great dining experience come in early and sit at the bar. Justin was amazing and made for a great time with the different kinds of drinks he made me and suggested the vodka meatball dish which was freaking great and apparently a favorite of the regulars. Flavorful sauce, well made ravioli, large portion size and good cheese.  The entry definitely underplays how good this place is. Not a very fancy sign or setting but you can tell the history of the place. And the converted house to bar and restaurant addition was pretty cool. Take care of Justin. He was awesome and newly married. Tip him big.",

It took a while to get waters brought out...our server did comp the one glass of wine that was ordered. She was fine but seemed rushed and overworked. The food, once it finally came wasn't impressive. For a $20 plate of pasta, I expect more. The Alfredo sauce was more like Alfredo soup. There was really nothing special about anything any of us had.  We ate outdoors and there were 5 gallon buckets filled with water not ten feet from our table...the overall vibe from everyone I saw that worked there was stressed and uncomfortable.  Overall, would not recommend.",

If you haven't tried Bonelli's yet then make plans to. Grab your best girl, your best guy, or your most intimate group of friends and go enjoy a beautiful ambiance and tastes of the old country. Kyle was our server and he was spot on in providing great service and in orchastrating a fabulous dinner experience. We tried four different main dishes which we all shared. I've always enjoyed a good Alfredo but I'm almost always disappointed in restaurant Alfredo offerings. Bonelli's stepped up and knocked it out of the park. This was a very pleasant surprise. This is not a budget restaurant in my opinion, but the experience, flavors, service and charm make it worth every penny. Favoloso!",

The cello homemade next door was so good and fragrant, I had the rosemary cello. Although I wish I would have ordered the parmesan chicken instead of beef bake , because it was a little too heavy for me. My boyfriend had the shrimp angle hair pass with the house sauce which was very, very good. We talked to the server aboutusic venues her, and other small cozy restaurants to visit here. But overall this was definitely a place to check out. Remided me of old Austin restaurants, before they got too corperate in Austin, which is what I missed about Austin the most!! Will be going back again!!!",

We went in and discovered that it is a very small place (7 actual tables) so I'm sure when it's warmer the patio helps out a lot.  Call ahead for reservations.  They do give you Italian bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which is good but not warm.  The menu is varied and we chose the pasta that you build your own.  They ran out of basil for the pesto sauce so I had to make another choice.  It was bland and they didn't offer grated cheese for the top.  Meatballs that I had weren't that tasty and neither was the chicken my husband had.  Our red wine was served ice cold.  So, all in all it was OK at best.  Salad was great and service friendly and helpful.",
