Awesome place to just sit and enjoy your environment. And the food! We got the smoked salmon appetizer and while I was expecting a thin sheet of salmon from the grocery store, we wound up with an actual filet of deliciousness. And they actually gave us more fish than bread which was amazing in and of itself. I got the pasta with cream sauce and it was absolutely perfect. One of the best sauces I\u2019ve ever tasted and perfectly cooked pasta. This place is just amazing. One of the best I\u2019ve had in Cape Coral. TRY IT.",
