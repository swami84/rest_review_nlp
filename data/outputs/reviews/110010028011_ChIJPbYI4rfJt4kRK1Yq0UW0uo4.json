We tried asking for a menu and he said \"You don't need to see it.\" We ended up leaving without getting anything and the guy followed us outside and locked the door behind us.  I've never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant before and I didn't even eat there.  It's a shame because I really like Caribbean food, but I will never go here again.",

There oxtails dinner comes with plantains although it\u2019s not written as such on their Uber Eats menu.  So don\u2019t buy an extra helping on the side because again the dinner comes with it.

Couldn't finish my meal because of how favorable, tasty, as well as how tender the meat. Almost falls off the bone, plus the Goat Meat Meal, just breathtaking. Once you keep your meal in a stable condition you'll begin to smile. And last but not least, the jerk shrimp and chicken. Has just enough rice, beans, tomato and salad it's a favorite. The reason why I say that, so many of the audience explain how beautiful it is. Please wash it down with there homemade sarry tea. I got a great deal for a few meals, June 2,2019/12:10am.",
