I have been to a lot of restaurants which are just opened and very busy. They may deliver the food slowly, but none of them: 1, Leave you outside for more than 1 hour when they already reserved a table( ask other restaurants what \u201creservation \u201c means). 2, Leave you at the dirty table with no water, no menu, and no waiter until the guests require for several times. 3, The waiter always rush here and there, and never really serve you. He(there is only 1 waiter) may stand at your table for 5 sec, promise to finish your request \u201creally soon\u201d, and leave like a wind. Of course, you will never see what you want \u201csoon\u201d. 4, Refuse to separate the bill with different share at the first time and claim they never see that request.  I understand that you are busy since you just open. But I do not see your heart to treat customers well. I think to you guys, \u201cBusy\u201d is just an excuse for your bad service, instead of an emergency that you need to handle. No extra waiter or waitress, no special offer to compensation.
