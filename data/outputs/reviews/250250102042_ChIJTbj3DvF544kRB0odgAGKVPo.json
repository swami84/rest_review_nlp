When I learned they were based in Boston, MA I knew that the next time I went to visit my finance's family in Franklin MA we would be going out of our way to eat here. The gal at the front was so delightful. The food was phenomenal!! We had the corn fitters (that dipping sauce is amazing), kale salad, dumpling sampler (omg pierogi!!), a green onion pancake sandwich, a house made honey tea, and the sticky rice dessert (out of this world). Wishing they had a branch in Oregon, but totally content to cook out of my cookbook until my next trip back to the East Coast. Thank you for a double awesome experience!",

The staff were amazing, their side dishes were great - the curried sweet potato is especially \ud83d\ude0d - and reasonably priced, and the flavoured ketchup is \ud83d\ude0d.

It\u2019s a pity this place didn\u2019t appear on \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d in its \u201cFried Rice\u201d episode. It\u2019s a great example of Chinese food evolving* beyond what is expected of it. (This is coming from a person who has worked in the Restaurant food supply chain and probably eaten too much Chinese food in their lifetime.)  We came as a group of 4 which was an opportunity to try as many things as possible: Carrot and Turnip cake Bluefish fritters Corn Fritters (a nice freebie as it was my first visit) Double Awesome scallion pancake Lemongrass and pork dumplings Cheese Pierogi Kale salad  Having said that, if you are a bit conservative about Chinese food or come with expectations of what \u201cChinese\u201d food is, I\u2019m guessing you are likely to be disappointed. It\u2019s a place I wouldn\u2019t be able to take my parents as they would probably moan at me as they have the quantity-over-quality mindset.  The staff were friendly and seem like a tight-knit team which is good to see.  It\u2019s easy to picture London embracing a place like this. Scallion pancakes done this way could be the new \u201cBao\u201d.  NB * The worst case of \u201cevolving\u201d I\u2019ve seen is a Chinese supermarket/restaurant being given a lot of LKK\u2019s newish Sriracha mayo on the cheap. Not knowing what to do with it, they smother a load of battered chicken with the damn stuff and is not a great combo with white rice.",

        "caption": "(This review is for the food truck)  I found Mei Mei to be a decent lunch truck.  The food was certainly tasty, it just had a few flaws that give this truck an \"A-OK\" rating in my book.  The Chorizard (play on \"Charizard\"?) is a bowl with chorizo, black beans, and carrots, topped with feta and fried shallots.  The chorizo was flavorful, juicy and savory.  The pickled carrots cut through the savory chorizo with a vinegary tang.  The apple dressing that covers everything in the bowl is a good source of tangy flavor; the black beans need that extra kick, and the apple dressing helps deliver it.  Unfortunately, I found almost no fried shallots.  Towards the end of my meal, I found one sitting at the bottom of the bowl and thought to myself, \"Oh right, there were supposed to be fried shallots in here\".  A big handful of fried shallots would have given a nice salty crunch, I missed them here.  The black beans were hit-or-miss.  Some were cooked great, but some were still a little hard.  They didn't seem to have much seasoning on them, and were a little bland eaten on their own.  The biggest issue I had, was that the bowl felt incomplete:  there wasn't any rice, or some big base ingredient.  It felt like I was eating all of the toppings to a rice bowl, just without the rice.  Since it was missing a good base, it wasn't as much food as I'd like.  The prices are a little steep for the amount of food you get.  All in all, I'll visit Mei Mei every now and then if I'm looking for a lighter lunch.",

The turnip cakes were nice and spicy, and less oily than the version you'd see at a dimsum place. The spicy ketchup is one of my favorite sauces at Meimei so make sure to slather your sandwiches in that. All in all, a great casual, quick lunch spot!",

The dishes were very small for the price. We only got 3-4 dumplings/fritters and a small bowl of noodles. The cumin lamb dumplings were amazing while the rib tips were a bit salty.  The others were mediocre. We also ordered the maple creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, carrot cake churros and s\u2019mores. The br\u00fbl\u00e9e wasn\u2019t warm when it came out but it was well caramelized. The churros were unique-hint of sourness but sweet. The s\u2019more was an incredibly sweet brownie with toasted marshmallows, graham crumbs and a few mint leaves.  We were quite hungry after the main dishes but the desserts were filling. Our total was $110. the dishes were great but incredibly pricey. Unique take on Chinese cuisine.",

My favorite, from the between-hours menu, was the Porco Rosso ($9), a scallion pancake sandwich with deli ham, cranberry hoisin, ginger-scallion ricotta and spring greens. Unexpectedly in 2nd place on my nascent ranking was the famous, modestly-named Double Awesome ($7) scallion pancake sandwich with local greens pesto, VT cheddar & 2 slow-poached-then-fried eggs; good--- but the runny eggs produced a rather doughy pancake. The scallion pancakes are not made in-house. By the way, those patrons who are hard up for the other kind of dough might be tempted to  excavate the trove of pennies firmly embedded within the restroom floor. After a few months of excavation, they may be able to afford a down payment on the $32 Bavette Steak.",

I had the beef heart tartare and the nutella biscuit dessert. Both were spectacular! The owner has been there both times I have and is very attentive. A very pleasant experience.",
