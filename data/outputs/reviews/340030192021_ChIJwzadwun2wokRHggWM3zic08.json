Chose this location as it was less than a 5 minute detour from my journey. It was in reality really really convenient being so close to NYC and got off before I had to sit in the dreaded George Washington Bridge traffic. There was limited parking at the restaurant itself but found a  public parking lot, 1/4 block away, for under $2.  I ordered the Seafood Tofu Soup with Ramen and was smittened with the Oysters that were served in the soup. For me the oysters made the dish! They were mouth-wateringly tender, delicate and flavorful ::drooling:: I will in the future order the Oyster Tofu Soup. Yummm!!! The service was prompt and the food came out fast. Complimentary tea and banchan were   a nice addition. After a satisfyingly delicious meal, the wait in traffic on the bridge didn't seem so bad. :)",

Alcohol is not available, so bring it in (there is a liquor store within a 5-minute walk) OK for lunch or dinner. Family is acceptable. BBQ pork is seasoned with strong eyes, but a good side dish of rice! There is more than 10 parking lots in front of the store. The unit price is about $ 20 and the cost performance is good.

Enoki mushrooms in the soup?  Nice!  The place is big enough for large groups and the tables are really wide - necessary to handle the traditional accoutrements if Kim Chee, spicy cucumbers, marinated soybean sprouts, etc.  Soup comes with a while egg for cracking into the boiling hot pot, just like you'd expect.  Vegetarian and vegan options are woefully limited.  This is basically a soft tofu soup spot, as the name indicates.  Fairly priced.",

If you set the hotness to HOT, it is quite spicy, so be careful of those who are not good at it. You can fill with kimchi, namul and rice instead of $ 10-15. High cost performance.
