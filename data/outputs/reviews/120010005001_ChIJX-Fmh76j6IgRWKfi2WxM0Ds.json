I am outraged because I know it\u2019s one of those very few places I will go forever and may never order from the menu because the specials are so original and delicious. First I walk in and staff was awesome, and as I prepare to order my previously strategized selections from the website, the bar maiden/vixen offers for me to be the first to try their new Reuben special! Completely insulted I said \u201cyes please\u201d...have you ever had in-house corned beef? Now I can say I have. It\u2019s my new religion. In all seriousness, this place is putting out seriously quality food off the beaten path of Sysco\u2019s monthly special. If you appreciate craft food and beverage, this place will make you update your list of special spots. Cheers",
