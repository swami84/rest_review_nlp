Canarsie is borderline little Haiti there are Hatian restaurants every other block. Your restaurant is not an exemplar spot yet. Just keep working on it. I support Black business. I dont eat spanish food so if you wanted this review removed you should have just asked. I would have done so immediately.

Not only that, but the owner is extremely rude to customers as well as staff. I would NEVER walk into this establishment again  ! Waste of time/money and just overall bad for my mental health, truly a DISGUSTING business. Should be shut down immediately",
