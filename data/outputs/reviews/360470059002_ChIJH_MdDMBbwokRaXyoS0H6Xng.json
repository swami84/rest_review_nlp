I like a bit more curry intensity but the goat meat was deliciously prepared with very little bone or fat. Fork tender and complemented with stewed potatoes ... tasted like what I was craving for sure. Jerk wings were also excellent ... piquant but not fiery. Well seasoned.  Perhaps the best of the experience was chatting with Dawn, the owner, and reminiscing about our shared memories of Hopewell in Jamaica.  I heartily recommend Jam\u2019It. Classic and friendly. Affordable. What a great asset to Red Hook!",

The potato salad is warm and is clearly not refrigerated properly and tastes sour. My co-workers have all told me not to eat there. They received molded coco bread. Under-cooked meat. And they don't send you good food when you let them know you received something bad. The lady tries to tell you you're wrong for wanting food that's not pink on the inside. She says they prepare the food by cooking it for an hour then freezing it until needed, then cooked for another hour.... She doesn't realize that when you freeze something then it in the oven its probably going to take an hour just to defrost alone. Then it should be cooked for another hour. Then when you come back in she doesn't offer to comp your meal for bad service, she wants you to pay again, like where did she go to school? i regret giving this place so many chances. I've eaten there at least 12 times and was disappointed at least 5 times. Today was the last straw. Never going back again. I hope I don't get sick form this warm sour tasting potato salad. i don't feel well. smh",

The pasta was mushy and gross and I never got my plantain with the chicken dinner. I only live about a 5 min drive from this place.

        "caption": "Absolutely the most abysmal Jamaican food I have ever tried.  I've been to Jamaica many times and real Jamaican food is very potent with bold flavors and spices.  All of the food here is bland, limp, dry, and near inedible.  In addition, the one time I ordered delivery from these people, the most psychotic Jamaican-American delivery man came to my door.  I was injured from playing football, so I explicitly put in the delivery instructions that I needed them to buzz and come up and deliver the food like they do pretty much EVERYWHERE else in the United States.  When the guy got here, he buzzed, I answered and he said with an attitude out of nowhere, \"food delivery\" in an exceptionally dry and irritated tone.  I disregarded it and buzzed him up like anyone would do to any delivery man.  Instead of coming up, he buzzed me again.  I'm thinking, \"that's weird, maybe he didn't catch the door.\"  So I buzzed again.  He continues buzzing like a madman.  I  buzz again and still he continues to buzz.  I say, \"look man I keep buzzing you in you got to open the door\" and he screams \"I'M NOT COMING IN THE BUILDING YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN!!!!\"   I said calmly, \"Uh sir could you please complete the delivery because I'm injured and can't come down right now.\"  He said, \"Did you tell the damn restaurant that?!\"  I said, \"Whoa man, you're being very rude and yeah it's on the delivery instructions on the receipt in your hands, can't you read it?\"  Then I proceeded to call the restaurant to get my refund.  While I'm trying to talk to Dawn to get my refund, we can't even concentrate on our conversation because this insane delivery man keeps buzzing my apartment repeatedly and long and an antagonistic way.  He didn't just keep buzzing my apartment for the next 20 minutes, he buzzed every apartment in my building repeatedly making my quiet brooklyn apartment building into an obnoxious cacophony of childish game playing by a full grown man who works for this restaurant.  The worst part was the woman on the phone, Dawn, refused to acknowledge that this man causing all this noise was being obnoxious and rude.  She kept claiming he didn't know I was injured and I kept telling her I told him already and he was extremely rude and now he's going crazy, I might call the police if he keeps this up.  She ended up telling me to call grub hub to get my refund.  No apology, no ownership of the incident, nothing.  She was just another child like the delivery man who was playing games with the buttons downstairs.  If you run a restaurant and want the restaurant to gain respect among its neighbors, maybe you shouldn't terrorize them and treat them like garbage.  I pay a good tip and am paying for delivery and all I'm asking is that they actually complete the delivery and that's too much for them to do?   Why should I come downstairs and meet them halfway?  Am I working for them? Am I getting tipped to make a delivery?  No.  I order delivery because I can't or don't feel like going out so it's their job to bring the food to me and to not harass their customers.  I've never despised a restaurant as much as this one now.  The food is terrible, but the service is record-breaking and earth-shattering awful.  Don't let this place with their bland food and abusive service deter you from trying Jamaican food.  Most Jamaican food is spectacular and most Jamaicans by far are respectful, courteous, and kind people.  These people are disgruntled and angry for some reason but that's on them to figure out.  Meanwhile, I'll never eat at this, the worst restaurant in New York City, ever again.",
