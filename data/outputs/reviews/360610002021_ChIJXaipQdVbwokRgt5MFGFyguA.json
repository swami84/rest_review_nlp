I explained I\u2019m a regular and she said she didn\u2019t care. I then asked if I should just take my business elsewhere moving forward and she hung up the phone. If you have new staff and they can\u2019t handle 7 orders with 2 delivery people in nyc, sounds like you need new staff. Also be professional and not sound clueless.  EDIT: To response below.  I never was told that information about delivery men getting hurt. Also, I never called again about a salad dressing later. I never called again after the hang up or placed an order from my phone (please check your phone records). This just shows dishonesty because none of that is factual. Also, why are you listening in to your employees phone calls when you are too busy to take orders? That does not make sense as well.",

I actually came into here looking for some cheap pizza a few weeks ago to hold over my kids hunger. Bad mistake, I have since been coming back regularly for regular slices, vegetable slices, pepperoni slices, pasta specials (meatball and spaghetti, and baked zitti.  I've noticed that the ingredients in the $.99 pizza are totally different.  After eating the $.99 stuff, I am tired, groggy, foggy. With Alphonso stuff, I am more energetic. Best of all my kids like them also. My kIds do not like the spicy pepperoni, they like regular peperoni. The kids also like to have paramsean cheese sprinkled on their pizza. The chef usually put some real parmasean cheese on the slices when asked.  They had a specially made Prosciutto topped pizza that was out of this world. I wished I took a picture of it. Yes, I like Prosciutto. Apparently, it's only made every once in a while.",
