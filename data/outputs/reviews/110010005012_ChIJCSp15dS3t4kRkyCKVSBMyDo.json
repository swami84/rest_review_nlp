Yes, that's pretty expensive, but so is $16 for a ham and cheese omelette with no veggies. The buffet option will include a made to order omelette with any meats and veggies your heart desires, along with all the traditional breakfast foods such as grits ( A southern favorite), seasoned potatoes, bacon, regular and chicken sausage, bagels, muffins, waffles and fruit. There were many more options that I can't remember, so even though you're paying your left arm, you have lots to choose from. Coffee and orange juice are included, along with 3 complimentary newspapers for your reading enjoyment. Wait staff was very friendly and helpful and kept a smile on their face. Funny people always talk about southern hospitality, but I've found that here in D.C., the workers are much more friendlier and truly act like they want to work.",
