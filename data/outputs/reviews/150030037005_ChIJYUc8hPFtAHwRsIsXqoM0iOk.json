Their plates were piled high with food....my disappointment was seeing wasted, leftovers on their  plates!!!  In Hawai\u2019i, service is TOP PRIORITY...inkeeping with the traditional Aloha Spirit. From the front reception desk to the wait staff, the busboys....all were very helpful, accomodating, seeing to your every need. They all deserve our 5 star rating...they may not be fancy, however, they serve their patrons very well...with good food,  amazing services always with a smile! Mahalo....The Plantation Cafe staff....we have returned many times & will continue to do so in the future. Transplants to Carlsbad, California .....",
