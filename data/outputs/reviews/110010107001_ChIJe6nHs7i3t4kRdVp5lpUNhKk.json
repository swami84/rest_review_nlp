While in line, I realized that I was not that hungry, and left to make my way to the all holy \u201cJack\u2019s Fresh\u201d. Let me tell you- I was blown away with the options! When I walked in, I immediately smelled Chinese food, and knew that I was in the right place. However, this is not for the faint of heart- one must go into Jack\u2019s Fresh with an open mind and open stomach, ready to mix many different types of food in one box. While checking out, I was greeted by the cashier with a bright smile and was asked how my day was. Then, she gave me my total: $5.51 for a whole meal of two types of salad, grilled vegetables and even some glass noodles- all from the cold section. To say I was astounded that the meal was that inexpensive was an understatement. Meals in DC usually go for at least $8, sometimes even more, and you are restricted to a single menu and usually receive small portions. I will be going back to Jack\u2019s Fresh to try out their hot bar as well as maybe breakfast.  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk.",
