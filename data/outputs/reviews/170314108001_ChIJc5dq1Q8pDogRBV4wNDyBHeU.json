I called before I came to ask if the patio was heated and was told there were two fire pits as well as it being enclosed on three sides-it had neither. As my order was taken the waiter seemed frustrated, the waiter then disappeared and was nowhere to be found during the meal, he went on break I later found out. The employees were arguing multiple times over who should be where and when. I asked for a blanket that didn\u2019t come until the meal was over. I asked for butter twice that didn\u2019t come at all. I asked to come in to get the check and was told I could only for it to get taken out to a table I\u2019d already left. I asked for a to go box and was only brought a bag. And at the end of my meal I was quite cold and underwhelmed. I was told sorry only by the chef after I had already complained and paid. I was offered no compensation only that if I came again the chef would take care of it. But the damage had been done and it should have been comped. Very dissatisfied.",

The atmosphere and customer service were  wonderful. Our server gave us just the right amount of attention to ensure we felt cared for and still had space to connect and talk. Temperature checks were made at the door and a mask is required to be in the establishment and when you leave your table. Indoor and outdoor seating make for great options, and all seating is properly distanced from other restaurant goers. The food was lovely to look at and well plated though unmemorable in terms of taste. Portion sizes are nice and allow for easy sharing. The drinks were one of the best features...fun and well balanced (whoever was mixing that day, knew exactly what they were doing!! Everything was reasonably priced (for Chicago and COVID). Even though the food wasn't my favorite, I would definitely return again for the drinks and ambiance alone...I would also likely order something to eat...lol.",

We ordered the shrimp and grits, lobster roll and chicken with waffles. The weather was perfect so we opted for outdoor dining. Our waitress Lisa was attentive, provided great insight about our selections and made the experience enjoyable. The staff were also very upfront about the bees that would also be joining us while we dined. I guess they also know how sweet it can be to find a great spot to dine. The meal with no cocktails for a party of three was about $60. The lobster roll was the highlight of all three, the chicken that accompanied the waffles was flavorful and juicy, sometimes breast meat can dry out but they did it justice. The waffles were too sweet for my liking so don't add syrup, add very little or skip it altogether. Overall, we enjoyed dining at the Mesler.",

Luckily our server, David, was very engaging and knowledgeable. I liked the decor of the main dining room. The books on shelves are a nice touch. The food unfortunately didn't show the same finesse. The Chef seems a little heavy handed with the salt in the seafood and pasta dish I ordered. The crab cake was a tragedy. Flavorless with a too soft texture. The only highlight was the roasted cauliflower. A dish like that makes the idea of being vegan almost tolerable. I did like the diverse set of patrons especially some of the most vibrant beautiful African Americans I've seen seated at the bar. Maybe next time I'll just have a drink and people watch.",

Because I\u2019m allergic to seafood, had to substitute the shrimp for fried chicken in the Shrimp & Andouille sausage & Grits meal. It was delectable! Also tried the waffle; melted in my mouth.

I asked a young caucasian lady with black her, who was suppose to be a manager for the patio area  if we could sit there if the ppl don't show up... she stated NO, because they paid for the seats.  Okay so did I and I was the first one there.  That was kool. So 4 ppl who work there and was probably off work,  say in the area I asked about,  drinking free from ther bar.

The challenge, and the reason I am giving it only three stars is the service timeliness. My server was super nice and kind... But it took her forever to bring even water, drinks, and food. At any given point I saw 2-3 people going around the tables, yet it consistently took 20+ minutes for any order to be brought. I doubt it was a kitchen bottleneck, because drinks were also impacted. Not saying I won't come again, but I hope management looks into this to fix it. It hurts the experience.",

I\u2019ve been here a couple of times for late night drinks and some afternoon refreshments, and had great experiences. The service is warm and attentive, and the food is as good as any restaurant you would find downtown! I\u2019ve tried a variety of dishes, sides, and drinks, and while the portions are on the smaller side, I have been surprised by how good they are.  I love the variety of seating options they have, and how many couches and nice seats you can find here. It\u2019s also a comfortable place to pull out a laptop and do some work outside of meal service hours. Mesler seems to be busy at every time of day, but especially at night, which makes it always a fun oasis to hang out in the neighborhood.",

It's been a fairly big disappointment considering how beautiful the decor and hotel is.  The food was average and definitely does not align with their price point. The thing that really stuck out and took away from our experience was the service and lack there of.  We came at a slow time before the kitchen had opened for a few drinks and ordered food 20 minutes after the kitchen had opened. Getting any kind of attention was an extreme chore. Our drinks were empty for half the night, and the next visit after our food was dropped off was with the bill. We wanted something to go with our frites as they forgot any ketchup or aioli but we were never approached.",

Mesler Mary has the perfect spiciness. Good coffees!  This place surely gives Promontory the competition it needs. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food and the atmosphere.  Be sure to make a reservation, as this place will be popular when people realize that it's here!",
