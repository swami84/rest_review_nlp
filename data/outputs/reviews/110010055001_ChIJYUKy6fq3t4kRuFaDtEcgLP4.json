It's just off the actual Dupont Circle on a strip with many other restaurants and shops close to the Dupont Circle Metro.  During the pandemic, Taim is open for a takeout only. I safely walked in for lunch on Monday and didn't have to wait.  For under $15, I ordered a green falafel sandwich with french fries in it and a Coca-Cola. The falafel has the perfect crunch and very tasty.  If you like falafel, I recommend trying Taim.",
