We showed up and had to find our own seats, it took us almost 15 min to get a menu and that's because we actually had to call a waiter to get us a menu or we would have still been waiting. The waiters rushed us in our order and wasn't paying attention, and throughout the meal we just couldn't seem to have a waiter give us any acknowledgement. Luckily the food didn't take as long to come. If the food wasn't so damn good here and in such a great location with good seating arrangement, I would never come back. I would have given a 3.5, but instead I will give 4 stars for good food and decor.",
