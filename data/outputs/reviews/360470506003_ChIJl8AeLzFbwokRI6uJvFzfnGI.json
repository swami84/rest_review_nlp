You will waste your money when you can order the same items (at the very least the wings) for 1/2 and even a 1/3 of the price with the same quality as a local Chinese restaurant. The restaurant had the audacity to sell a portion of rice the equivalent to that of 5 spoonfuls for $2. The bulgogi was absolutely appalling, my 1 year old who literally eats everything even spit it out in disgust. Maybe they were having a bad night but the wings for sure as hell are not worth $14 when the local chinese restaurant offers the EXACT same wing size, sauce and the same amount of wings. The dine in experience may be worth the additional cost but for take out/Delivery this is a straight up NO GO.",

The ambiance is a bit like an old sports bar, but everything is very clean and I hear they have an outdoor space that will be great once it gets warm outside.",

The only critique I  have is I wish the fries weren't steak fries! While these were seasoned well, I'm not a huge fan and prefer my fries thin and crispy. Jiku\u2019s liquor license is pending, when that comes though this place will be hard to get into. This Restarunt is a must try.",

Hopeful that we didn't have to go all the way to flushing every time just to get good Korean food and we were not disappointed. We truly enjoyed eating at this place. The decor of the restaurant is very nice. The service was outstanding, Josh was our waiter and he was very attentive, polite, and helpful. We ordered soy garlic wings which were very delicious. Just the wings alone makes this place worth a try. Crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside and not oily tasting at all. The seafood pancake was great, very rich seafood flavor, and fried to perfection. The kimchi fried rice tasted amazing and the portion was huge, easily shared between 2 people, possibly 3. The bulgogi Burger was okay, bulgogi meat between two slices of bread, more a sandwich than a burger but I still enjoyed it. The only disappointing thing for me were the fries which we ordered the special fries and honestly there was nothing special about it, tasted like normal fries yet we paid extra for them. Still though this is a great place to come and grab a bite to eat.",
