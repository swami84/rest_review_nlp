There was no sign anywhere in the establishment that stated \u201cyou will be charged .50 cent for all electric purchases under $10. Just disappointing over all but my pizza looks good.

The garlic knots was hard and inedible and the marinara sauce that I paid for was missing from the order. And the specialty slice I ordered was missing from the order. I still decided to just eat the pizza but as I am eating the pizza a found a little piece of white cord mixed in the cheese if my slice of pizza. I was so disgusted that I decided to call the restaurant to inform them so no one else has to experience this but I could not even get a manager on the phone. The person that answered was nice enough but it seemed like she didn\u2019t really care and neither did she ask for my number so that the manager could call me back. She only said that he wasn\u2019t there yet and that she couldn\u2019t reach him. I have never had this experience before. I have ordered from this restaurant previously months ago and didn\u2019t have a problem until today. This order was for myself and my kids. I had to throw it all in the garbage. I will never order from this restaurant again and honestly I feel like I should stop ordering take out all together because if this experience. The standards out there for a lot of these restaurants are subpar. If i am going to eat out I will stick to a top of the line restaurant that prides themselves on the quality of there food and quality service like Morton\u2019s Steakhouse. This is what I get for trying to support the little mom and pops establishments rather than ordering Papa Johns or Dominos.",

They deliver, but nothing better than picking up and taking home your pizza. An 8-piece pizza, half plan cheese and half pepperoni was 12US $. I recommend.  (Original) Pessoal legal, mas \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio falar bem.o ingl\u00eas. Fazem adapta\u00e7\u00f5es as pizzas, que s\u00e3o super saborosas, pe\u00e7a pelos sabores tradicionais americanos. Fazem entregas, mas nada melhor que ir buscar e levar para casa sua pizza. Uma pizza de 8 peda\u00e7os, meia plan cheese e outra metade pepperoni ficou 12US$. Recomendo.",

Forgetting my food I started taking pictures of them.  I was approached by a gentleman who introduced himself as Oriel. He gave me the scoop on the art as he set up for the exhibition of the month (March 2018), suitably entitled HERstory. Isn't this fantabulastic!  Under each painting is the price and artist's  information. The work in my opinion is nothing short of amazing and I was taken aback by how reasonably priced they were. (No I still didn't purchase anything because I'm on a budget and she's kinda crazy if she's messed with).  I met Cheryl Haung another artist. Imagine, Chery told me she started painting about three/four months ago and I thought surely, she's joking. No way! Look at her work in my pictures. That woman is a genius!  Back to the actual Pizza restaurant Daddy Greens. (sidenote, I walked in thinking it was a natural food/juice spot). The restaurant is clean and the washroom impeccably so. Its walls constructed mainly of wood with pine cones as embellishment.  The pizza is good too. Hehehe, I almost forgot I came for food.  Thanks for a wonderful few minutes guys.  The End.",

Holyyyyyy bajeezus was it delicious. The pizza had a crust that wasn't too doughy or thick and had a surprising scatter of sesame seeds baked into it that added a wonderful extra crunch. The jalepenos and tomatoes were fresh, not canned, and the mozzarella was also fresh. We were told 45-1hr wait, but it was delivered in less than 45. Loved the pizza so much, we ordered from their restaurant again. This time, we tried the Super Mario and it was equally as delicious. The white sauce was creamy, the mushrooms were piled on in heaps and the delivery was quick.",

I ordered a margherita pizza using Seamless yesterday and received a confirmation that my order was being prepared. About an hour after the delivery was supposed to arrive, I attempted to call the restaurant, but they were closed. THE PIZZA NEVER CAME! I called back today, and spoke to one of the managers, Ronny. Ronny wasn't apologetic about the incident, but eventually offered me a refund or to resend the pizza. I attempted to schedule a redelivery with him, but he first forgot to tell his night staff that they had the approval to deliver me a pizza. The restaurant staff stated that they would call me back after talking to Ronny, but forgot. I later spoke to Ronny who said that they would deliver the pizza tonight and throw in some free food. When the pizza finally arrived 24 HOURS after the original delivery time, there was no extra food, and my pizza was cold. I called Seamless to discuss the complaint with Daddy Greens, but Daddy Greens refused to offer me a refund.  Terrible customer service. I will never eat their mediocre pizza ever again, and they do not give a crap about you as a customer. Also they put sesame seeds on their crust. WHY?",

The beet salad was pretty good, but a more potent Gorgonzola would make it excellent. I most likely will never be in this area of town again, but if by chance I am, I would definitely come back to try more slices!",

While I have had garlic knots from all over the US, I don't know much about baked ziti. Maybe it's really good for ziti, maybe it's not. I just know this stuff was pretty gross. The pizza was pretty good. Quite saucy with big medallions of mozzarella. We ordered with sausage added to it, which was a mistake. The sausage was gristly and definitely did a disservice to the pizza. There are also sesame seeds rolled into the crust, which was definitely off-putting and may not be everyone's cup of tea.  I would suggest that if you are hankering for 'za, just go with the Margarita pizza and skip the accessories.",

Specific praise: 1)The quantity and distribution of toppings is perfectly balanced, they aren't stingy with anything and also don't overload it. It seems like whoever is making the pizza is actually putting thought into how it would be best designed to get the right proportions of flavor in each bite. There are no 'good' or 'bad' pieces. 2) Their salads are awesome. When I order here (usually just for me), I'll get a couple salads and put them in the fridge for later meals.  They are always the perfect size and Daddy's knows how to mix the right proportions of ingredients. Also a plus that the dressing is delivered on the side. 3) The quality of ingredients is high (I'm VERY picky about this and a bit of a pizza snob). The ricotta they use on the Nona pie is amazing. The only other place somewhat nearby with the same quality is Speedy Romeos (also A+ pizza but not directly comparable to Daddy's because they're different styles). 4) They offer a 12 inch size.  It's nice not to have to buy a massive pizza, and I also like how this creates a desirable ratio of crust-to-slice and means the pizza isn't so big that the middle is soggy. 5) As others have mentioned, they include sesame seeds on their crust.  This creates a warm flavor and nice differentiation.  I'm excited to have such a great pizza option in the 'hood.",
