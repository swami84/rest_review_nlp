Awful service, clearly understaffed. Took a very, very long time to even get a drink. We sat with just water, no bread or anything for 45 minutes. Entree came out before appetizer. They at least didn't charge me for our drinks but then when I received the bill there was a unknown extra charge that I had to get removed. Glad I noticed, the staff just seems very disorganized. Skip this one, there are much better spots to get dinner in the Riverfront.",
