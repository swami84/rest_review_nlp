Then a few days later for date night ordered online during our event, and 40 minutes later I showed up, 2 hours before the posted closing time, and they had three other people in lobby. When I walked in the door the Male said he was gonna shut off the lights but he could take our order, I explained that I had already ordered online 40 minutes ago and pre paid with my credit card. He told me it should \"bounce back\". Told me he could still take my order but I refused and told him I'd let them know if my money didn't return. 5 minutes later it was returned to my card, presumably by them. I can understand hating your job but dont go trying to close early and tell your boss it wasn't busy while your actively refusing pre paying customers. Totally disappointed because this place is 5 minutes from my work and I planned on making it one of my go to places but after this expierence, I will never set foot here again. Nice work guy",

She said rudely \" didn't you already add stuff you don't have to add it again\" I said I only added extra cheese and sour cream and she said \" yeah we'll put it on there\". Then I asked didn't a drink come with it as no one had asked me what I was going to have to drink, she said yes, the young man asked me what I wanted and she then blurted isn't it a customer order why are you saying what kind you want, I then told her it was my order and I am picking it up (which I'm sure Grub hub alerted them of that because they alert other establishments as well).
