I ordered the same order AGAIN, and was assured they\u2019re deliver it rig away. It has now been ANOTHER 40 MINUTES and still no food, no one has even called.

I call the store, the one on 36th and at first they told me that kind of pizza doesn't really come with a lot of sauce. Mind you, I didn't say there wasn't enough,  because there wasn't any. They tried to credit me but I wasn't gonna just take them at their word, so I asked for a replacement pizza. They tried to discourage me and say its gonna be an 1.5hr wait. I said I got time. Less than 45 minutes later a knock at the door... I guess people must have canceled their order because the wait was cut in half. U would think all is well. I grab the pizza from the driver, and its extra heavy. I go inside,  open the box to see an undercooked pizza,  over smothered with sauce.... now is this how customer service works? Spitefully making a replacement pizza because you messed it up in the first place? Bad form, Dominos on 36th in Anchorage AK",

Delivery man said nothing but i felt his grin, because his effort to make the delivery was real quick. I took a bite and wow, the best tasting pizza i have ever had. Perfection made in a pizza. Not burnt, not soft, perfect. Sorry i made no tip to you. I realized after i ate. I recommend this place for pizza made. I will blast you. This is my tip to you.

The container it came in was less than half full of noodles and chicken. For $8 that was just sad.  The cheesy bread was good, I really liked it! But I came uncut, and being in a hotel, I had no means to cut it, so I had to tear it apart.  I didn't get my side of ranch, which I paid for. I used to deliver as a driver for another chain, and I know that you check every ticket before you leave to avoid this exact issue.  They did get me my 2-liter though without issues, and the driver was a nice guy!  All in all, this was an abysmal display of incompetence and has cemented my view that Domino's is a waste of money.",

The thin crust is nice & crispy and has become a family favorite! We love the tracker that shows you EXACTLY what stage our pizza process is in and EXACTLY who will be delivering our pie! We really like knowing the name of the person showing up at the door and no more guessing when the delivery is gonna show up- we can see it and KNOW! How cool is that?",
