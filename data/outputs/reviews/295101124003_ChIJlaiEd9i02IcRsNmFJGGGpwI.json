The reason for my 2-star review is Unfriendliness of this place! I have been a customer for a past year, maybe a little less, and have yet to run into a friendly staff member! Last time I visited this place was just terrible customer service on part of the hostess who behaves like she's literally a Hollywood star plastic surgeon: I have never seen in my life hostess so full of herself. I walked in, and wanted to sit at a bar with my husband and a friend, and there WAS enough room at a bar for 5 people, but she said \"We don't have enough space for all of you\", and I said: \"Well, I don't mind standing if you're missing a chair\", to which she replied: \"Per my manager's policy I am not allowed to let you do that.\" I said OK, and she just stood there looking down at me. All three of us looked at each other confused as to what was going on, and we just walked out. SHE REFUSED to service us, although we were more then appropriately dressed, and not even close to being drunk because we had not had a single drink prior to coming here. Also, let me mention that it was 9:30pm, so not an extremely busy time. She was never very pleasant, whenever me and my husband were there, and tends to brush me off every time I'm there, but this last time was just too much. I can't believe that a place like this would allow something like that to happen!!! I have taken 15 minutes of my time to contact the bar via the contact page, but it has been 4 days, and I still haven't gotten any reply. Ridiculous.",

The charcuterie came with tiny pickles, grainy mustard, and three types of cured meats. Service was wonderful and very accommodating. Very chill environment.

Anything you ordered was good. After a much anticipated visit from our friends, we took them to Taste last night to show them what St. Louis is about. What a disappointment. All the food was terrible and the cocktail list even worse. Just a typical American fare with bigger portions and average tasting food you feel bad paying for. What changed, my friends? Go back to what you were doing before. You could tell it's changed. In the past we've needed to wait for a table. Yesterday (Friday night) it was empty.

The atmosphere is very classy, with low lighting and candles all throughout; it's great for a date or for celebrating an occasion with a small group. It's a cocktail bar, but the food is beyond excellent. They have a pretty short menu of mostly small plates, all of which I've tried. The dishes are unique and elevated with lots of complex flavors. Everything is skillfully prepared and plated beautifully; not a single dish is short of great. It's no surprise that the drink menu is very extensive. I stuck to traditional cocktails, which they do well, but there's a long list of their own creations as well. Servers are very kind and knowledgeable. Overall, Taste is one of the better places I've dined in St. Louis!",

Every bite was a symphony to the taste buds! From the Brussel Sprouts, to the brownie, everything we ordered had an amazing subtle flavor hiding behind the main initial taste. The bruschetta was a little different.... A darkened, almost burnt taste in the outside crust, but with incredible flavor in the topping.  Service: Michael was a fantastic wait or, very knowledgeable about every detail of the menu we asked about plus some. I couldn't decide on a drink, so he asked a few questions about what I was feeling like and then said, \"I'll bring you something\" - what he came back with was perfection! He even played a song we requested through the system!  There wasn't a drink or food choice I wouldn't go back for. (except maybe the octopus which just tasted like chicken. :p)  Definitely a place I'm coming back to...",

She over explained herself, was confusing, and overall unaware of how to retain a possible consumer. We explained that we were expecting five or six folks, and she explained that there was currently no space and didn't give us the option to chill at the bar.  There were enough seats to accommodate us, although the seats weren't contiguous...but we were prepared to make due. I urged her that we'd be okay at the bar, needed no hand holding, and would wait for seating to open up. The bartender was pretty great. I wanted a mezcal drink, but there was no specific cocktail on the menu...but he still made me a great citrus based drink that tasted great. I ordered a scallop crudo that was a disaster. The chef needs to seriously modify this dish. For starters, it should not be sitting in pools of sub-par butter. These perfectly prepared scallops were wasted in the presentation. The fries were great, as well as the (housemade?) garlic aioli. Our sixth person came and we saw that there was a four top and an adjacent two top available. They weren't reserved, so I was pretty excited to take a seat and order up half the menu. We were, although, blocked by the host with a flurry of excuses of why we couldn't sit at these seats. She was speaking in circles and after three minutes of near begging, I suggested that me move on to another establishment. I am pretty far from this in my life and current experiences, but I can safely say that our race played a huge part in the difficulty around being seated at Taste, which was a huge disappointment. I've served as a high end line cook, personal chef, front of the house employee at several establishments and although I do understand the stereotypes that commonly marginalize Black patrons, it's totally bogus and not okay. We were prepared to have a great time, and tip more than accordingly.",

The staff seem willing enough to help you through questions though so maybe it wouldnt be so bad for some. The drinks we ordered were a great blend of components I can't imagine the others to be bad unless you dislike a specific ingredient. We ordered small plates (Caesar salad and chicken wings) as well to go with the drinks. The wings are HOT so keep that in mind. Very delicious though. The Caesar is...a Caesar. Nice surprise to have the croutons actually be breaded chicken.",

The food was fantastic, and the bar made delicious cocktails through the evening. Also, the bar sent over a complimentary glass of champagne, which was also wonderful of them and completely unexpected! Overall just a great date night place in Central West End.",

My favorite food dishes were the gnudi and the grilled flank steak. My favorite cocktail was Heavy Water, but instead of vodka, I substituted it for gin per our server's recommendation. Everyone at the table ended up ordering that for their next cocktail after sampling mine. We will definitely come back next time we are in town!",

The light is ambient (but not overly dim) and curtains line the entrance where a hostess will greet you. The first time I went, the wait was 30 minutes and we were offered a seat at the bar. And boy, I'm so glad we accepted! There were 3 bartenders at the bar and Joel served us until our table was ready, offering not only drink suggestions but an extensive knowledge of each of the ingredients in the menu's cocktail. I love interesting, creative cocktails, but I also love knowing exactly which ingredient is being added to my drink... so this was my jam. The experience was so much fun! I admittedly was behooved by many of the foreign names but Joel delivered satisfying explanations (all the while impressively multitasking with multiple cocktail shakers and fruit presses). The drink menu is definitely inspiring, but if I had to recommend one cocktail it would definitely be the Ab-duck-tion. Yes, I'm a relatively adventurous eater anyway, but I think even the old fashioned drinkers would enjoy this one! It's a lovely combination of duckfat infused grand marnier, lavender bitters, absinthe, egg whites, and marscapone. YUM! My new obsession! When we were seated at our table we had a very happy buzz going on, and the food was served pretty quickly. We continued to order cocktails while seated-- we couldn't get enough! And the food was delicious. Altogether a homerun experience. I'm definitely planning all of my upcoming St. Louis trips around a visit to Taste!!",

They have small plates (think \"tapas\"), you want to order at least 3 of them to share with your date.  They change the menu every other week or so, but if it is still there, order the beet salad... yes I know it is just a beet salad... but it is GOOOOOOOD !  Oh and the drinks are AMAZING, they are some of the most elaborated and refined mixes I've seen anywhere, however, do not order with food, order them after dinner because they are so elaborate and rich they collide with the food -- it was my only critique I had when they came to ask what I thought. Order wine or stick with water first, then DO try the original mixes.  The place is small, dark-ish, with good ambiance and decor. Make sure you have a plan to wait for a table just in case (not sure they take reservations for a company of two).",
