They include breakfast for $50 dollars per person, which goes along way even with the high prices here.  We ordered lobster Benedict, bruschetta eggs, skillet cinnamon roll and mango chia seed pudding.  All were excellent with the standouts being the cinnamon roll and lobster Benedict.  The cinnamon roll was probably the best I have ever had!  Service was very good as well and we requested a nice table by the window.  Overall I would highly recommend Travelle for breakfast/brunch if you are staying at the hotel or in the area.",

Tl;dr - hidden gems: bread and pork butter (w/honey comb) and asparagus  Food: bread with pork butter, meatballs, 6oz filet mignon, and the coffee budino.  Drink: sparkling water and zinfandel ($21/glass)  The meatballs were served with toasted bread. The meatball itself was average but the toasted bread with the marinara sauce was a great combo.  The bread with pork butter - RECOMMEND! The bread is toasted and deliciously savory. Complimented with the pork butter that\u2019s a bit spicy. Paired with honey comb! So good!  The filet mignon was served with some sort of flashed fried broccoli and tendon. The steak was tender and the broccoli added a wonderful crunch and flavor. Broccoli was quite delicious. It was crunchy, slightly salty, and just tasty.  I had their Zinfandel paired with my filet and that complimented nicely.  Macaroni and cheese was average. Crispy potato was good! The toppings are baked IN to the potato. Asparagus was crunchy and flavorful - hidden gem! RECOMMEND",

We are not staying here on this trip to Chicago, we're here for a conference on someone else's dime, but we stopped in for a couple of drinks and a pre dinner bite.  The room is beautiful, with a great view.  The drink list is extensive, and the cocktails strong.  The loss of five stars is due to the gorgeous looking, but vapid staff, more into posing with each other, than helping the patrons.  The manager isn't hiring them for their gregarious nature and serving prowess. The staff looked more like the chorus line for the show \"Chicago,\" than people working at a bar in Chicago.  I expected a leather pant, chain smoking, Bob Fosse to walk in yelling at the gathered staff, \"Let's go people.  Let's see those kicks.\" The patrons were an after thought compared to their own narcissism.  Yet, this is a great splurge spot, reminiscent of Malibu, Santa Monica, and Brentwood. Carl Sandburg's \"City of Big Shoulders\" was nowhere to be found. Two glasses of wine, two cocktails, meatballs and bread equaled $100.00.  A bargain for such a display of banal beauty.",

Best of all, there is extremely low staff turnover with most of the staff in place for three or four years.  A perfect formula, perfectly executed by a perfect staff.  A tiny bit pricey, but in such elegant circumstances, who wants to eat or drink quickly?  The slightly high prices encourage you to savor every aspect.",

We dined in the restaurant for the first time tonight and it exceeded my expectations. Maurico was knowledgeable and provided wonderful service. And the food? Simply amazing. Our group started w the empanadas and pork tostada, both of which were perfectly sized as starters. The mix of flavors in the tostada was so good.  Squash soup was pretty good but our entrees were at the level of the starters. Branzino was perfectly prepared and the risotto? Quite simply the best any of us had ever had.  We shared the cauliflower and the brussel sprouts, again, perfectly prepared and so flavorful.  The table we sat at managed to be both elegant and incredibly comfortable.  All in all one of the best dining experiences I've had.",

The wait staff is excellent, give good recommendations and are helpful. I was with a large group the second time around and they were happy to work around us, especially with the ones finishing their drinks and the late comers.  Also, definitely check out the lobby on the way to the restrooms, the hanging marbles are gorgeous. They also do a high tea in that area, will be back to check that out",

Clearly the night we were there in August 2017 either the chef wasn't, or, the restaurant has simply slipped. Doesn't this sound delicious: \"CRISPY THAI CHICKEN WINGS \u00b7 peanuts, lime, fresh herbs?\" Yes, it does. We ordered it, and the wings were hot on the outside and ICE COLD on the inside. Not just one, every single one we tried. Not as if they had been sitting too long and cooled, but instead because they had been frozen and not cooked well enough. A health threat and an unsettling feeling when you bite into that. So they apologized and returned soon with another one...surely the chef would know, and check, taste a wing, or use their thermometer...but no. Again, the hot wings were ice cold on the inside. Not sure who was cooking or what was wrong with the process, but it was a little disgusting. Everything else was delicious, but I just won't be able to return. And as an aside, to Travelle's management and to other restaurants who use the same tactic, when something goes wrong and you really want to make up for it...send the GM out, or the chef, apologize, try your best to make up for it...but offering a complimentary dessert after dessert was initially declined, and the check was requested, is not really a great way to apologize or ingratiate yourself to your guests.",

The sauce was not a standard Hollandaise as is usual on a Benedict, but rather something much more citrusy and a perfect accompaniment to the salmon and the beautifully cooked eggs. Wedge potatoes had a strong herb flavor but were unremarkable. Service was attentive.  It should be noted that, although we did not have wines (since it was 10am), the wine list here is perhaps the most interesting in the city, with a very broad range of selections ranging from extravagant to affordable, and all very interesting.",

They had a \"Chef's week\" menu, which sound delicious, but they forgot to tell us that the portions were half size. Appetizers were fine, Pork belly and gazpacho soup - nothing to rave about, but solid. The soup was too milky and fruity for my taste. Entre: Halibut and Lamb chops. Two tiny, very thin lamb shops that had very little flavor and burned on the outside. This was not even an appetizer. halibut was okay, nice 4oz piece with small potatoes and a delicious sauce. But again, vey small. We mentioned the small portions to the waiter who offered to bring more food, we settled for coffee with the dessert, it arrived 15 minutes before the dessert. Oh well. Service was fantastic, and to their credit, they want to make it up for us. Overall is was a nice experience, but a restaurant is first and foremost about the food and we left hungry. Will we go back? Probably, I've heard they can do it right.",

Beautiful dining room with a pristine, lab-like kitchen visible behind glass; delicious food with expert preparation; and very personable service which is also personal and warm--no detail is overlooked, and no request is too small, so every diner feels like a VIP, no matter how fancy or casual the occasion.  The wine and cocktail selection leave nothing to be desired.   As with most hotel restaurants, a trip to the restroom requires a bit of a stroll, but the hotel's decor makes it a nice trip with plenty to look at along the way (including an adorable gift shop).  The bar/lounge on the same floor offers a limited food menu, but the same great drinks and unbeatable service.  I understand that they are/will be featuring a special cocktail of the week or month demo in the coming months (a new program that the talented and creative bartenders are looking to try out), so I look forward to a return visit in the coming months.",

The decor is modern and chic, just like me hehehe  Anyways, the dining room wasn't full, but I think this was intentional as it was the holidays and the experience is partly due to the full attention of the wait staff (which we had).  Our server was wonderful (I forgot his name).  We had the prix fix menu and everything was wonderful.  I loved how the dessert cakes were presented on a cart, and later plated with a beautiful presentation.  The spiked rum was warm and rich, a perfect ending to our meal.  I definitely want to come back and try the a la carte menu.",
