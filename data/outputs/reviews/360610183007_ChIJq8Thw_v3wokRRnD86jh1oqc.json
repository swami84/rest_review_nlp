Sauce was watered down. Not even authentic mole. Cheese didn\u2019t make justice. So bland and un creative in every way. Rice and beans had same result. Nothing memorable about it. Just plain boring. Drinks... well that\u2019s another story. Drinks were well done with great flavor. 2 stars for drinks and friendly staff. Food needs to be revamped.",

We've been on the hunt for a good Mexican restaurant that is fairly close to the C / B subway line in the 125th to 81st street area.  Tried a bunch and Rancho Tequileria made the top of the list for us.  We've tried quite a few items on the menu over the past few months.  Our go-to order is now pretty much the nachos and the carne assada tacos.  The nachos are really quite taste - my wife loves them.  And the carne assada tacos are wonderful.  I also love their Jumbo margaritas.  The environment is very welcoming and the staff is super friendly.",

To top everything off it started raining and then hailing which I immediately told my fianc\u00e9 let\u2019s go inside the restaurant. A minute later the restaurants awning fell to the ground. Luckily we were inside. Later that night my fianc\u00e9 became ill and was covered in hives and swelled up. He had shortness of breath and could have lost his life.
