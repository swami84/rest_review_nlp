When we ordered a hookah the guy tells my friend $30 for the hookah. I hand the Hookah guy a $50 dollar bill im expecting $20 back then tip him. Instead he hands me $10 back and quickly leaves. I'm then confused so I ask the female hosting us she says $40. I then witness the people in front of us pay a $20 and 2 $5s so the Hookah is $30 and they are ripping people off behind the scenes and both the hookah guy and female are in agreement. We didn't approach it after because we were having a good time but this is wrong be careful out there.",

On the last weekend prior to COVID taking over, 2nd week of March 2020, I decided to go visit this place to celebrate my 30th birthday with a large group of friends ; about 20 people. It was a great night and with day light savings happening, we lost an hour. During that night, we had a large bill; there were many bottles purchased. The police then crashed the place around 2:00AM , leaving us with one hour lost. I had just purchased 3 additional bottles.  When Police came, I told them to refund me since the bottles were unopened. The manager insisted that I come back since he had no way to do a \"refund\". These are bottles paid including MANDATORY gratuity. I would say over $400 per bottle.  Fast Forward.....  Due to pandemic, everything was closed, places were limited. However on the night on November 6, 2020, I decided to pay a visit and ask for the bottles promised. With hope to receive what I paid for, I was DENIED by the owner. According to Manager, owner refused to give me what I PURCHASED. That night, I decided to stay and spend additional money on an establishment that did me wrong.  Customers are always FIRST and the OWNER should be reaching out to me BECAUSE I was refused to RECEIVE what was PAID for by ME. I will reach out to the BANKS and file a CLAIM as messages have been recorded between establishment.  Please UPGRADE your CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE",

When we asked to order another bottle but said some of my guests wouldnt be allowed to stand by our table. They charged 20$ cover to get in and mandatory coat check. Also, no credit cards after 10 which im sure they dont report this. It was my birthday and they made is super u pleasant definitely never going there for any occasion!!!!",

Manager could care less he was extremely rude and did not care how disrespected I felt. His exact words were \u201cbuy another Bottle or move away from this table I have other people willing to buy bottles. Then he walked away and never came back. Little did the manager know I was about to buy another bottle but from how poorly my friends and I were treated I wanted to get out this place ASAP. I am a manager myself and that is not how you handle a poor customer experience. I have never came out for a night of fun to leave feeling so belittled by not only the host , the waiters and the manager himself. DO NOT COME HERE . Go anywhere else. All they care about is taking your MONEY.",

The first thing the waiter said \"ya come to early\" (with a nasty face) when the place opens at 3pm and we entered around 3:45pm. After this she said that we were too many that she will have to deal with different bills (ofcourse you will is your job we are the customer we are paying and probably tipping good) so we decided to make her life better and pay as a whole group and split the bill (we are nice people) but this wasn't all they were rushing us to leave like we weren't consuming, they were uvercleaning and taking our plate before we finish it, so disrespectful. We asked them if they want us to leave and after this they calmed down a little bit. The reason why we didn't left the place was that we came from work with bags, tired we dodnt live around this area and it would going to be too much for us to be going somewhere else.

To be insulted by a staff memeber after tipping 21% to an incredibly attentive server was incredibly disappointing. Honestly, had to pick up and leave immediately as we felt so embarrassed by her actions. I will be calling the business to request a full refund for the services rendered at this location. Also, business owners should take measures to properly train their staff on how to provide exceptional service. One poorly educated staff member should not ruin the great work of others who know how to treat their customers. Ultimately, just very poor service.",

We came here to have a good time but that is definitely not what happened. My friend was called stupid in Spanish by a security guard near the bathroom for doing absolutely nothing. When she replied to him in Spanish (because they assumed that she was not Hispanic because of her skin being dark) the security guard then decided to be nice. After that we stepped outside for a bit and upon entering el jefe my friend was approached by security guards. They then forcefully grabbed her by the arms and told her she needed to leave. She did not do anything to deserve that. As she was escorted I went to close her tab and met with her outside only to find her crying because how she was treated for doing ABSOLUTELY nothing. I went back in to use the restroom and at that point a security guard grabbed my arm and told me that I am not allowed back in. My friend and I were no threat to anyone in el jefe but because of the color of our skin we were mistreated by men at that. One should never feel like because of the color of their skin they would be treated with disrespect. I will never come to this place. I've had different experiences living uptown that were racist because I am African American. If you are African American don't come here because you will get treated like an outcast. Its sad that we are still dealing with this today.",

I presented with a group of 3 males (African American) and 2 females (hispanic) and upon presenting identification we were denied entrance due to one my friends not having a collared shirt. We informed the bouncer that we could see several people inside without collars. He stated the rule just started recently. We then walked away and saw a group of hispanic males enter with t-shirts directly after us. Its unfortunate that we were discriminated against in this day and age. I never right reviews but I felt compelled to share this information.",

The atmosphere was innovative with the glowing blue eminating from the several large screens on the wall. The dj was on time delivering cuts that kept the floor alive. I met wonderful ladies the first night we exchanged snap usernames and I did get one phone number. The staff was respectful and helpful toward me.  People were really friendly. Hard to find clubs with an atmosphere like this these days.",

The new one I got wasn't burnt at all but the taste was less than satisfactory. We had to continue to send the waitress to get each of us water (unsure why she couldn't just bring the entire table water).  My friend ordered seasoned fries and the only seasoning they used is SALT. They were extremely pushy in getting us to order a hookah refill since our first one was free. According to their promotion, a group of 4 females get their first hookah free. when we got there nobody knew what we were talking about even though my friends and I follow the DJs on social media and this is what they were promoting. The owner noticed that we were dissatisfied and came over and told my friend she would remove our food orders from the bill and even gave us a round of shots, but they didn't remove anything and the shot was meh. I'll probably never be back.",
