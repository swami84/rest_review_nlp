After putting my pin in correctly the first time, it got declined. I put the same pin number again, it was accepted, but Aziz told me that it was for a different amount and that wassnt my charge. I took the Recipt and showed him that it in fact took $5.06 off my card, and the transaction said approved. He said that wasn't from my card and it was from a previous sale. I said no it's not because my card number is on their saying it was my transaction . I told him he entered the wrong amount and Aziz kept insisting that it was my fault I did something wrong. I told him check me out for the right amount, and then give me a refund for the $5.06. He was incredibly quick to ring me up for my correct total of $6.78, but then when I asked for a return he said he couldn't do it. I told him that he has to refund me the 5.06, I have the Recipt in my hand, the charge coming out of my account to prove it, and I'm on camera that I didn't get any merchandise. Again he refused. The manager than came over, asked what was happening, and I explained to him what was going on and told them I would be calling the police if I didn't get a refund. The manager immediately said something to him and another language, clearly said shhhh, and made him go into the back. He then refunded me my money. This was not about the dollar amount, but the fact that Aziz, tried to steal from me. When I caught him, he insisted that it was my fault saying I somehow messed with the machine. I'm not sure if this was an accident, but when he clearly could have fixed it but chose not to, insisted on it being my fault, and refusing to give me my money back, made me think he was trying to steal it. AS I WAS LEAVING, AN EMPLOYEE FROM SUBWAY (there's a subway inside this BP) Called me over, and said quietly \"GOOD CATCH, THIS ISSNT THE FIRST TIME THAT GUY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF STEALING THEN NOT GIVING A REFUND. MOST PEOPLE JUST LET IT GO BECAUSE ITS FOR SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT AND DONT WANT TO ARGUE.\"  My thought was correct, and after hearing that, decided to post this so everyone going here is aware. I don't know what their trying to pull, but any problems using a credit or debit card be VERY carefully when paying here. I'd honestly just take my business elsewhere. I will never go back there after what happend. Watch out for the clerk names AZIZ, but they could all be in on it.",
