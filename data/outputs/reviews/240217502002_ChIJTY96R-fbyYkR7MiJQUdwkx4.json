Service was glacially slow.  Our 3-couse meal took two and a half hours. My husband joked that our waitress, whose name was Taylor, was certainly not Taylor Swift!  That said, my appetizer was excellent  - an onion tart garnished with a quail egg, pickled pear and salad. My daughter's mussels were good but few. The sauce was heavy on wine but not enough other flavor, if any. My husband's meatball was just okay.  As far as the entree, my rabbit ragu over pappardelle was fairly unremarkable. The pasta itself was perfect. The meat was just mushy and no real flavor. It was lukewarm. My husband's hanger steak was excellent and had a nice hint of smoky charcoal.  Dessert was a miss all round. The tiramisu was very strong on coffee with no discernible cocoa tang. Cute presentation in a martini glass but my daughter remarked that she'd rather have great tiramisu than a great presentation. It was also not fully set. My husband had strawberry cheesecake with mascarpone. It was light and fluffy but not especially flavorful. It desperately needed something tart like citrus  or rich like chocolate to finish it off.  Servings were adequate and appropriate but not large. Value for price would've been questionable if it weren't price fixe. Still, it was $125 plus tip  which seemed like a lot for what is definitely not fine Italian.  Will I go back? Unlikely. Too pricey to be this inconsistent.",

Both deserts (Spimoni cookies and cherry panna cotta) were below average at best.  We will not be back.

Traditional favorites mingle with contemporary specialties. The wine and beer list is refreshingly diverse and reasonably priced. Our server Nicole was attentive, personable, helpful and....absent when appropriate. (So appreciated while we caught up) She evaluated our need to chat and only intervened when our glasses required replenishment, or we were in emergent need of DESSERT!! CHEESECAKE WITH CHERRY CARAMEL!!! WHAT?!?!??!?!!? Dont hesitate, make the call, get your table...and enjoy the dining experience and the atmosphere to chat...for as long as you like!
