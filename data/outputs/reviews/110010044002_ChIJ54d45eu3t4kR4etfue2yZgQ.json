We sat waiting for a while for our server and when she finally came we were greeted with frustration. brushed it off and ordered some mimosas.mimosas were brought as the server told us she usually pours the drinks but she\u2019s too busy right now. When gratuity is included you can forget about service most the time. After being rushed and flustered you would think that she could at least take the time to make us feel welcomed. Anyways, There was a bug in our orange juice and when we brought it to the servers attention instead of taking a look for herself she reacts like we\u2019re crazy and proceeds to tell us how she\u2019s sure it\u2019s not a bug. We were disgusted at this point because we did have a sip of our drinks. The server told us don\u2019t worry she will take the orange juice off and expected us to pay for the champagne. With her attitude, service and the bug in our drink we were no longer interested in dining. All after making reservations 6 hours prior and holding off on eating or going somewhere else so that we can come to Brooklyn. We rationally expressed that we will not be finessed into paying for the champagne that we didn\u2019t get to drink. Stuff happens, we get it. We explained that it was not her fault and we are not upset with her and she proceeded about everything the wrong way. Instead of hearing us out she tried getting herself out of the situation by calling us aggressive. no one was aggressive, we were simply expressing our concerns and she constantly cut us off by telling us she will take the orange juice trying to force us into paying and shutting up. If it was anywhere else we wouldn\u2019t even have to be defending ourself.",

The manager said the server didn\u2019t knock it over so I had to pay for it. The manager sent for the bouncer, who was confused,  because we weren\u2019t loud or argumentative.

Service was good but bartenders were doing double duty with the brunch tables  around us upstairs. Thus service took a minute, although they were very attentive when we got our slotted time.... Overall: Drinks were solid, Decore was Std. (i.e upscale dive bar),  Food... looked decent but didnt try... P.S bathrooms were clean #blackToilets... overall 4 starts will need to go back update after getting a good feel of all they have to offer....",

Worse decision ever all the staff plus manager act as if the never say this add before even though their name is attached and tried to blame it on the promoter. This is what they did to gain a crowd at this place. I explain to the manger and the host and showed both the rsvp ticket I purchased it, the host acknowledged it but the manager said she never seen the ticket yet other people were there on behalf of the ad. The owner treated to call the police I felt very offended  and did not deserve to be treated with such disrespect. The owner was extremely aggressive,  rude and nonchalant folks do not go to this place there are better places in dc with better service. The food was not even worth the price advertised I\u2019m so disappointed the owner couldn\u2019t offer me anything corn atleast coming out to their organization they do care about the customers only the money. I will never return.",

Food options include buffalo or old bay wings - fried to the perfect crisp, brick oven pizza, meatballs, fries and arancini. All that and a DJ spinning hits from the 3 decades?? It's a win for me!!!",

Other employees also said they waited weeks to be paid. It\u2019s against the law to use someone for work and not compensate even if they are no longer there for training or work. NIce place to eat, but work wise the manager Kitty will not be direct and will not pay you for your time regardless if she sees you fit or not for the job.  Update 6/1/2019 the owner contacted me and resolved the issue they had no idea what happened and paid for my time there. The restaurant is a good restaurant, I enjoyed everything about it and the staff was nice and helpful BUT Kitty one of the managers needs to either switch locations or step down. She is not a nice person and did not contact me or tried to pay me for my time.",

The place is beautifully decorated with a chic yet simplistic style. The music isn't too loud or too low and the songs were on point, an eclectic mix. Second, the drinks are bomb. All the specialty cocktails I tried were nicely blended and ornately garnished, a perfect paring for the food. We tried the Tuna Poke, Arugula Salad, and the Salmon entree. All of these dishes were exceptional. The tuna was delicious, not the least bit \"fishy\" tasting. The arugula salad was dressed well, and the salmon had spectacular flavor. My friend also tried the Burrata, which I had a bite of. The mozzarella was super creamy, I was definitely impressed. On my second visit, my friends and I bought a table for a birthday celebration. We had a phenomenal  time! The music was fun, a nice mix of today's hits and the classics. The bottle service was on point, our cocktail waitress poured our drinks for us and everything. Ultimately, my experiences at Brooklyn on U have been really great, I will definitely be coming back!",

You have the option of grabbing dinner and then heading up to the lounge right after for some fun. It\u2019s definitely not your typical U St spot. It\u2019s very classy and sophisticated but with a twist of fun and good times. Brooklyn is definitely in my top 5 spots in DC and I can\u2019t wait to go back!",

I have so many great things to say about this place, I don't even know where to start.  For starters, the service here is great! The minute you walk in, you are taken care of with smiling faces. The team is also very knowledgeable about not only food but night life as well. Making everyone's experience enjoyable from start to finish.  The downstairs area is a bar and restaurant, and the upstairs area is a lounge with plush velvet seats. It's a one stop shop and you never have to leave. After you eat, you can have a drink at the bar, or go upstairs and party all night long with a popping DJ! The ambiance is super cool with a lot of different photo ops. There are are neon lights with cool sayings like, \"it was all a dream,\" \"brooklyn,\" etc. The grass walls and brick walls also add a great touch. They have live DJs weekly too. The cocktails are very cool (instagram worthy with edible garnishes) and have just the right amount of alcohol in them. *Meet me at Cardoza is my favorite.*  Lastly, the food definitely has bragging rights. I hate pesto, but the pesto pizza here is to die for! The pesto sauce is house made, so it has a very fresh and flavorful taste. I also really enjoyed the salmon. IT IS COOKED TO PERFECTION.  The service, vibe, and food here are perfectly balanced. If you're in the area, you have to try this place!",

While it is a beautiful restaurant and the service was good, paying $12.00 for a vodka Sprite was a little much.  The speciality cocktails, $14.00 were very tasty and I would have to say worth the price. It might do them well to have a happy hour with hh prices.The music was so loud, me and my guests had to fight to hear each other between the loud music and 6 women screaming to talk over the music.  The problem came with the food. We ordered the mac and cheese with bacon and jalapeno and we all thought it fell flat in the taste category.  From then on we ordered the sausage pizza and once again, we all felt it missed the mark. It was luke warm and not very flavorful. I was in the mood to try the prosciutto and arugula pizza. Wow, once again we were all in agreement that this was one of the worse pizza we had ever had. We recalled Jumbo Slice from down the street as a worthy comparison. The pizza was half prosciutto and cheese and the other side was arugula and cheese. Not so much prosciutto but lots of cheese. Most of the arugula was cooked into the cheese offering no real taste of the arugula. It was also very greasy and  bland (but garlicky). I would recommend the owners take a short  walk up the street to Paola to see how real pizzas are made. We will go back to try other offerings but this was not a good start.",

The mac and cheese may be the best I've had in the city in years. Each of our seven entrees were tasty with standard portion sizes - we really liked that the salmon came with lentils. Our drinks were presented with floral garnishes or fresh cucumbers. Each had really robust flavor, so we probably drank more than intended, because every new drink brought to the table gave someone else cocktail envy. The prices were very reasonable. I would definitely return and recommend.",
