We\u2019ve had to awkwardly go back and forth with the employees about orders they\u2019ve gotten wrong. Every time we come into the store and ask for help to pick up an order we have been completely ignored for 10 to 15 minutes without any acknowledgment. The food is just not worth the hassle of dealing with the employees.",

And they also barely speak english and could not understand our orders. The all you can eat menu has almost no hot plates, which is something I consider a lot. Comparing to the sushi king in Sterling I will give it a 4 and Sterling 10+. And is more expensive than Sterling too so keep that in mind. I was so happy when I found out they opened one in Rockville but then very disappointed with the menu. Ive been to 5 Sushi Kings already around the us and this is the worst by far. My advice is to add some hot plates and deep fried sushi to the all you can eat menu. I would love to go back for that!",
