Very Mom and Pop, BYOB,  small, easy to get a table, big dishes, great price, and super clean. Soft shell crab is great, all the curries are good, the salads are bomb, whatever fish sauce they put on the fried chicken is fugggn great. It can be a bit quiet in there, so bring some drinks to make sure you can keep the convo going with your guests, whenever the hell we can eat in again.",
