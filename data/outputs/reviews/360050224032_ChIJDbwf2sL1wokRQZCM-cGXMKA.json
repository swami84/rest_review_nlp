There was a crowd of people waiting for their orders only to be told that , they do not understand why the app is accepting orders. No wonder this location has one star and bad ratings. So much for franchising and gentrification in the Bronx, people really enjoy your food but we also enjoy real authentic Mexican food.

Let me inform you there were also about 15 people waiting outside for their order's because this location was 15 minutes behind on every order.",

The food was watery the portion was very little & cheap, and the food was cold, one of the bowls was missing the cauliflower rice. It was horrible for there first day opened. Then I order chipotle again hoping it\u2019s coming from another location I\u2019ll take Fordham over them, but unknowingly the food came from here unfortunately. The food looked better than the first time but it was still bad the portion was still cheap it barely had anything not even a scoop of anything it was like a tablespoon. The food was cold when it arrived and they forgot one of the drinks, I ordered two drinks they only put one drink in the bag. The chips was way to salty I couldn\u2019t even eat them. I\u2019m never ordering delivery again if they going to keep having this place make my food. No thanks. This is the worst chipotle ever.",

What makes it worse is that the chipotle app is only picking this location for delivery when I have two other locations that are much closer to my location. Avoid this location & call customer service if the app isn\u2019t allowing you to chose your restaurant of choice.",

You place your order and still have to wait 20 to 30 minutes over expected time.  Was the order correct, nope not as requested.  As someone else indicated, the amount served is ridiculous compared to other locations.  I\u2019ll take my business back to Bay Plaza or Pelham, NY. Come on Chipolte you can do better than this!",
