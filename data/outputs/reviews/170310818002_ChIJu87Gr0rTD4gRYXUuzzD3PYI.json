As I waited for my sandwich to be made I noticed every employee couldn\u2019t keep their eyes off the surveillance monitors. It was starting to get uncomfortable being watched as if I were stealing items. After paying for my food and drinks I asked for a receipt. I checked and the bottom had all these phony taxes added on it. (Chicago sugar tax) which ended 2 months after the bill passed in 2017. 4 years later and this place is still charging this tax ($1.06) for a vitamin water. When I brought it to the store managers attention she said, \u201cit\u2019s the new flavor of water that adds that tax, we\u2019ve never had this before\u201d. As they\u2019ve had coolers of this product and old signage around the place, obviously lying. Be careful and always check your receipts.  The part that gets me the most, they have hundreds of cameras looking for thieves and they\u2019re the ones stealing.",

I now work across the street so I decided to pop my head in.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the Deli tucked back in the corner, offering a pretty extensive sandwich/wraps menu. I've ordered breakfast sandwiches in both instances.  Seriously substantial and well-made; the crew behind the counter has been super friendly.  Can't base my rating on anything else in the store although as it's 'convenience' the prices on items I noted while waiting do seem to reflect that...so there'll be a premium.  The Deli, however -- excellent options and so convenient.  I'll be heading back regularly!",

They forgot, or never learned, how to read the tastes of their young, international & sophisticated, high-income market, which populates this area in fast-increasing droves.  It is a truly sad epitaph when the Walgreens in the next block, on Chicago Ave, which is spectacularly badly-managed and staffed, looks good in comparison.  The nail in their figurative retail-coffin, is the out-of-date white wine stock in their cooler: the savvy Wine  Distributors are using this sorry establishment to dump their unsalable expiring wines rather than take a loss on the stock. The ignorance of the buyer (s) in this category is sadly exposed by this travesty of retailing. This store is an insult to the upscale area it purports to serve.",

This last time I asked how come the price tag sticker says $2.49 and I was being charged $3.02. The lady at the grocery check-out then lied to me and said it was due to city and county tax. If that is the case, Chicago sales tax is now 20%. It is high enough as is! I hate thieves even more than liars. This place just lost my business. If you don't like people ripping you off, you should be careful here. What the Galleria Market is doing is some very petty stuff. Charge what you think is right and let the market decide.

Galleria also has a decent salad bar and a HUGE selection of sandwiches that they make for you while you wait. My main complaint is that is really crammed and hard to find what you need. But I guess that is how they are able to offer such a great selection in such a small space.",

If you enjoy your liquor, and consume it in bulk, this may not be the place for you.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the liquor AND wine selection is quite large, I just wouldn\u2019t go in with the expectations of paying anything less than a premium price.  Overall this place is great, the owners are friendly, and it has pretty much everything you need from a high-end convenience store.",
