First and for most I would like to say this is not acceptable if your a restaurant and a restaurant establishment this means you are open to the public. This restaurant is not listed as a hall. It\u2019s raining outside and I walked in without reading Any signs as I always do when I come to purchase food. The nasty woman inside in front tells me this food is not for walk ins it is for a private party. I told her excuse me I am a paying customer. I\u2019m here to purchase food as I always do. In the past the section with the glass covering the food shows the food made for the day and normally the food I choose from every other time. However because it\u2019s today and a private event that section was not open hell the entire restaurant was not open to the public. It is currently 8:58 Thursday evening and if you google the restaurant name you will see it shows open and closes at 11pm. Well if the business was closed why didn\u2019t it specify that at the actual door. The signs they placed were on the floor and it is normally signs that show special for instance like the one that shows lunch special right now along side the one that shows private party. If the sign were at the door I would have read it directly at the door. I am not leaving this comment because of the sign not only being visible to me as I walked in but also because the staff female that was standing in front had a very nasty attitude. She didn\u2019t say politely I am sorry but we are closed no she tells me this food is not for you tonight. However other nights that I have ordered it was the only food available at that time. So please enlighten me was I wrong to be upset. She was rude and I spoke to the owner and advised him what happened he did say sorry and asked if I wanted to order I told him no thank you not after her rudeness. Never again just because of this one time would I ever order from this place again. I used to order from them a lot. But now I would never step foot in again! I have a photo to prove signs were incorrectly placed and not visible.",

I have had issues with delivery in the past, however, I have overlooked this because the food is good. I called to get a catering menu and the \u201cmanager\u201d and her nasty attitude wants me to go to the establishment to develop a catering menu with her. I asked her to email me something and she wouldn\u2019t. When someone is trying to cater they shop around in advance or like to see their options. Most places have menus for this. Then she tells me no \u201cyou want things done the way you want, not the way it\u2019s done\u201d. Like that\u2019s how other establishments operate. That\u2019s ridiculous. I tried to call back to get the owners information, the \u201cmanager\u201d wouldn\u2019t pick up. Again, their food is great but just like other reviewers said, the attitude is terrible. I\u2019m really sad that I have to give up my business with them and all the praises I have for their food but I can\u2019t with that disrespect. Very unprofessional.",

Do you really think by replying to my comment and lied about it will do any good to your business?  Shame on you,  I don't gain anything from this but I felt the need as a local guide to let people know how you guys handle your business.

This restaurant dose a fine job of blending both & still offering variety outside just RICE & BEANS!  Ill do as I always do and list it's Pros & Cons.  PROS: -This place is the only place I know locally that listens to my requested order and provides ALL OF THEM! - They have mixed up my order before and sent out someone to replace the meal anyway. - somtimes I font order Spanish style meals and when i make special orders they call , confirm & still provide all the accomidating requests . -Whenever I need to call, they make sure Simone who speaks great English is on the line. -Once or twice I was told before my order would be late it would be late and provided an extra soda. (very nice Customer service)  CONS: -They can be hard to talk too if no one I,daround to,help -much like a lot of restaurants , they get overworked and your order may not come 100% warm - sometime their price can be High.  Esentially , they are a amazing local Resturant & i endorse eating here.",
