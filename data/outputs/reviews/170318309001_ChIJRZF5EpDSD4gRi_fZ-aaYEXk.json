Wife got French fries which were good but standard. Enchiladas were very flavorful and tasty. Steak tacos came with almost a slaw on top and the steak was tender. I will go back. Each had a drink and the tab was $50 so even price was very reasonable",

The churro fries were delish as well. I ordered a coke and it was bar coke, kinda flat. Beverages are really important to me lol I would've preferred a can.

He was on top of everything. Oto, the owner also came out and greeted us. Between the group, we shared everything on the menu. Wings (apparently #2 in the city)  and pozole were my personal favorites, but honestly,  I would order anything and be ecstatic about it. Music was great and the local artwork around the place (all artwork, including table tops, were for sale) were the icing on the cake. I will probably make another trip to Chicago, just so I can go to Estrella Negra again. Thanks guys!",

I came across an Instagram post from the restaurant that  advertised taco Tuesday(margarita and tacos for six dollars- no details on quantity). What a steal!! I know! WRONG!!! we get there and the waitress takes our order. I wanted to be sure about the  promo so I asked her if the pricing is correct?  She had no idea what I was talking about so I pulled up the post for her. After she reviewed it she stepped away to call her manager to confirm the promo as she was unaware. The manger didn't answer her call so she agreed to honor the promo at six dollars. The meal than would consist of three tacos and a margarita per person. Great! We placed our order for the 2nd time with a total of nine tacos and three margaritas. The waitress came back to our table 20 mins after we placed our order and tells us the manger had called back and modified the prices. Ha! So now the tacos would be three dollars a piece and margaritas at six dollars a piece. She preceded to ask us if we wanted to modify the quantity of tacos. So after all that of course we did! We ordered six tacos instead all with NO ONION! 30 mins later (now at 50 mins) we received our tacos and they all had onion. Since I refused to send my food back I decided to take the onion out myself. I was waiting for the waitress to check on our table and she didn't show her face. My brother-in-law asked her for the check and still didn't receive it after 15 mins of waiting. He took it upon himself to walk up to the bar area and ask for it instead. I'm beyond disappointed with the entire dining experience. Owners if your reading this.. do the consumers a favor and stop posting false promos! It hurts your business more than you think.",

Most of it sounded like healthy like for example they had green-tea horcata, avacado shake, sweet potato churros, black bean dip and the items on the menu that was like that i just cant remember it all. I just got 3 curizo tacos and my fiance got steak tacos. It was still good i just would only get that everytime i would come here. I can see alot of people liking this place i just aint healthy enough for it. Which is my fault. I would still recommend this place for someone like that. I loved all the artwork too.",

Ive seen plenty of entertaining images that caught my attention , mainly the Tamarindo Chicken wings, which are Great. They are Sweet but pack some low key heat that hits u after the bones have been dropped on your plate. I was surprised how tasty the Goat Cheese Empanadas are, goat cheese and salsa work well together. Make sure you eat your empanadas right away while they are fresh, they lose a little love once the crunchy crust is softened by the cream and salsa. Loved the fries they have a light crust on them as well. Store front/near store front parking is not much of a struggle on the weekend since the \"no parking\" restrictions are mon-fri. Nice selection of mexican and local beers, comfortable seating & staff. I personaly need to go back to try the elote man tamales. Enjoy.",

The story begins like this: I drove by several times before the grand opening, getting out of work, coming down 90/94 exit, I was just waiting for this \"Tattoo Parlor\" to open so I can get Inked up! I even looked it up online to see what the schedule was... OOOOW surprise when the day came and me and my girlfriend headed to the place, to find that this magical spot was to not be a Tattoo parlor but now one of my All Time favorite eateries. I've celebrated my birthday here, friendsgivings, I even rented the place for my cousins baby shower once! Why? you may ask. Because I love the concept and the food is unique, traditional Mexican but with a Unique twist, healthy, some may say, and overall great tasty food!  The rest is History......  To all out here, do visit this fantastic place, good for date nights, friend gatherings and mingling bashes. Its a Family Owned and Operated, Local, which I highly support, People friendly restaurant with phenomenal food.",

The tamales and the posole are on point, although i do wish that they would bring oregano and spices to customize your posole a little more and some tortillas. But it is super good anyway. The breakfast items are great too. The art work on the walls was amazing and the artist that painted the table in the booth i sat at is extremely talented. His initials are A.M. the bloody marias are delish and the other drinks are awesome too. If you like wine, its byob, and if youre a coffee person, they are serving dark matter coffee. Yummy. The deserts are also pretty great. Btw.. Try the tamarindo wings. You will never get over them. :)",

Great margaritas, the steak tacos are delicious and the poblano enchiladas solid with a little Gita cheese twist. The spicy salsa is very spicy! We\u2019ll be back. Friendly. Cosy.

After being seated, we waited for like 15 minutes before anyone else even acknowledged we were there. No water, no silverware, no nothing. Service after that continued to be slow. It was busy but the staff didn't seem to have any sense of urgency or any idea that we had been waiting for so long. Really, a simple \"Sorry about the wait\" would have gone a long way.  Then I received steak enchiladas instead of the chicken I had ordered. To be fair, I didn't remember that I'd ordered chicken until I'd half-finished the food, and the enchiladas were good anyway. But still, they got the order wrong.  And, we still didn't have napkins or utensils by the time our entrees were served. And it was very difficult to get anyone's attention to ask for some.  And the crowd was obnoxious. But I guess that's not really the restaurant's fault.  Definitely never eating here again. I would think about maybe takeout, but the thing is there are so many better, cheaper options around this part of town, why bother?",

Their menu selection and dishes combine different kinds and styles of food in a way that you would never think. Their style is best described as \"gourmet Mexican.\"  All of their chips are handmade and made-to-order.  Fantastic service and even better food.",
