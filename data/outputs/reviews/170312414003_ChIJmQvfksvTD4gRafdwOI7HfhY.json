To the wings .The pizza is a thin square crust and baked and cut into bite size square pieces. The ingredients are super fresh every bite is light and crunchy full of flavor. We also tryed some desserts like the panacotta and a small baked apple pie with a custard filling. Everything was delicious \ud83d\ude0b.",
