When I got home I realized that only half my order was in the bag. (It was really cold and windy that night, btw). I knew they delivered so I called and told them they forgot half my order and asked if they could deliver the other half. They told me that the delivery guy was unavailable so I have to walk back. I\u2019m hangry at this point. Yes, I said hangry. and pick up the rest of my order. This was the first time I\u2019ve ordered from this establishment and heard really good reviews but wasn\u2019t having a good experience. I told them how unhappy I was with having to walk all the way back (by the way, the delivery guy was still there, chillin inside). I explained to them how I\u2019m disappointed in the lack of customer service and I need to be compensated for my time and energy. The manager reluctantly gave me a free drink for having to walk back and pick up the rest of my order. Needless to say, I really wanted to hate the food but unfortunately it was really good. Good food, terrible customer service.  Pt 2: ordered a fried chicken sandwich and for exactly that. Pieces of fried drumsticks and thighs sandwich between two slices of bread... with shredded and not melted cheese. This place is a joke.",

I could have been a health inspector and would have appreciated an apology but didn\u2019t get one. In addition, she still charged me for my food. I just left this establishment about an hour ago and although I don\u2019t deny the food was good and the risk of eating out and wanting to support black businesses, her insulting my intelligence and having an attitude behind it would make stay far away from this B grade restaurant.",

We all had Mac n cheese and potatoe salad as sides. Both were delicious. Vegetable dinner: had the cabbage. Tasty. Was not seasoned with any meat so great option. Baked turkey wings: finger licking good! Had rice and peas also super tasty! Now about the desserts.... We had the banana pudding-sooooooo good. Made like momma. We also had the lemon cake...DIS-GUS-TING! the cake had no lemon taste and the frosting was super yucky. The Carrot cake was good but the frosting tasted like roach spray smells. Had to scrap it all off. Other than the bad cakes this place has GOOD FOOD. So many other items on the menu to try. Can't wait.\ud83c\udf74\ud83c\udf74\ud83c\udf74",

I have the kind of family that tells you to unbutton your pants at the table so you can eat properly (which mind you, I never do).  I know soul food! & this place is the way, the truth, and the life! No man shall come to the Father until they have sank their teeth into Napoleon's Sweet Potato Cheesecake. Baaaaaaby! But let me not skip to the desert yet.  I live walking distance from here so there is a lot of this menu that I have explored, but there is much that I have yet to explore bc my \"good ol faithfuls\" make it hard for me to waiver. The Honey BBQ Wings are basically what I order every time. They're big, they're drenched in honey bbq sauce sauce and have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. The collard greens, potato salad, candied yams, and mac & cheese are the side dishes that I alternate with. All delicious although I feel that since the mac & cheese is baked it could stand to be much cheesier.  For desert I never, ever ever ever ever... leave this place without getting a slice of the Sweet Potato Cheese Cake. & I don't even like cheese cake. But this right here... WOOO. Listen, if you do nothing else, take my word on that. One more honorable mention that I'll give is to the Arnold Palmer. It's not for everybody. It's so sweet it might make your eye twitch. But that's how I like it, bc if you can't tell already, I'm a little crazy. Enjoy!",
