I was still hungry after my meal, and the dessert menu did not offer a remedy.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, which consisted of approximately one serving-spoon of grits and four shrimp.  It is important to realize; the portions are small, but the food tastes great. The prices are a bit steep for what you get. We do not have an issue paying for expensive meals, but I'm just giving folks a heads-up for anyone anticipating a typical Southern cuisine portioned meal.  Also, heed the warning regarding off-list drinks.  Do not order cocktails that are not on the cocktail list, even if the server assures you of the bartender's ability to do so. I ordered a Moscow Mule, and it tasted more like a Moscow Hyena \u2013 just awful! The atmosphere indoors is relaxed and cozy, and the outdoor seating is refreshing. There is metered street parking (if you are lucky), and there is also parking available in the Liaison Hotel\u2019s parking lot. Overall, this is a lovely spot with a distinctive twist on Southern cuisine.",

The restaurant is a part of the hotel, so that may be a bit confusing with finding the entrance. However, everything else makes up for it. The atmosphere is very welcoming and fun with designs that give the place a neosoul feel. The wait staff are so sweet and understanding. The food is exquisite and the staff are more than ready to assist if things aren't going well. The price is a bit more on the pricey side, but totally worth it considering the proportions you receive. There's options for the vegetarians of the group and there's a nice selection of wines as well as a dessert menu (I highly recommend the peach cobbler!) A great place to visit and I will more than likely visit again.",

My one knock is that they try to fuse and fancy it up in ways that just doesn't mesh well with down-home cooking.  That being said, sometime it works very well, such as the slow-smoked pulled pork sandwich, which has Korean elements with a kimchi slaw on it.  I have been a few times, but the last time was Summer Restaurant Week and I will be back again.  It's not perfect, but consistently quality.  I would also recommend it to you for events,  I have been to several receptions here and they do a great job.",

Such a cool concept, however about 15 minutes after we ordered the steak, we were told they didn't have any food for dogs available except for the frozen treats. We were so sad because we literally only picked this place for the Pooch food. The human food was very subpar and I would've rather eaten somewhere else.",

There are two dishes in particular, both appetizers, that are making my mouth water just thinking about them, and I feel like I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t recommend them to everyone. The Tartare is unique; I\u2019ve never had tartare spiced with Indian flavorings before, and it is a work of art. Pairing it with Naan is a touch of genius. The scallop crudo (which I think is sadly not on the menu at the moment but will hopefully be coming back soon) is similarly exceptional. The wafer thin slices of scallop practically melt in your mouth, and their delicate flavor, combined with the cucumber, is something that I find hard to describe in words without sounding hyperbolic. Chef Alexander creates dishes that are not only exceptionally tasty but also fantastically creative.",

We came during brunch, and found everything to be satisfactory. The (geechie boy) grits were fabulous, as were the chicken and waffles. The service was a little slow and our server was a little inattentive, but overall I enjoyed our visit.  Our server didn't know what \"geechie boy\" referred to, so I'll enlighten you - the geechee/geechie gullah are a community of people who live in South Carolina. They are the descendants of enslaved Africans, who speak their own dialect and have their own unique culture. The stories of Brer Fox and Brer Rabbit, for instance, come from the gullah culture. \"Geechie Boy\" is a company whose name references that culture/language.",

One member of our party had a minor emergency en route to the restaurant and was delayed ~45 minutes, they would not seat the rest of us until the full party arrived.  They also refused to seat us together.  We sat at two separate tables of 6.  We did notice other diners seated together in large groups of 8-12.  The food was good, but for $60/person I expected better.  Certain dishes were exceptional, some were sub par, some were average.  There was nothing we couldnt have made at home.  Many of us paid extra for the prime rib and found it tough and dry.  I think the desserts were the high point for most of our party.  The table service was excellent and our server was polite and conscientious.  .  When we made the reservation, we were told it included something to take a way-- some sort of extra sandwich, in a doggy bag, or similar.  As we were getting to leave, we asked, and were told \"we did that previous years, but not this year\".  We do not plan to go back.",

No reservations needed. We came into the city for brunch and my boyfriend wanted to try Art and Soul because the chef, Art Smith, won a James Beard Award (although not for Art and Soul...for a book) and is considered an expert on Southern cuisine.  That day, I was very much in the mood for pancakes so I ordered the lemon pancakes ($12). My boyfriend ordered the BLT Benedict ($15) with a side of mac and cheese, and our friend ordered the three egg omelet ($14). The pancakes were huge! Three stacked pancakes, maple syrup, and a side of seasonal fruits. Fresh fruits included watermelon, honeydew, pineapple, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. I fulfilled my craving and got my dosage of five fruits a day. The pancakes were good but I think it's pretty hard for a restaurant of this caliber to mess up pancakes.  My boyfriend enjoyed his BLT Benedict, which came as two poached eggs on some bacon, alongside some watercress and potatoes. It looked really good and unlike some other places that serve up eggs Benedict, the side of watercress was a refreshing and balanced one.  Service was so-so. One of the other servers seemed really energetic and nice, while our server was mostly quiet but efficient. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews where people got sick, but luckily none of us fell ill afterwards. That would have really ruined the holiday for sure! I'd come back if I'm in the area and need something quick and simple, but I wouldn't actively seek out a meal here.",
