Dinner was delicious and food was cooked exactly as we had ordered and the 3 people in our party all had great reviews of all food and drinks. We didn't get a chance dessert but next time we are in. LOVE THIS PLACE and their throwback mid-century modern vibe, dimly lit afterglow and I cant say enough about the staff....read more below for a dramatic story..  An amazing staff with the heart of gold, from the manager to the host everyone in this establishment is amazing. I found out the hard way when my wife left her wedding ring on the table of this restaurant and only realized after we had Uber-ed away. We  quickly turned around and looked onto our previous table with horror when we noticed that the table had been stripped of dinnerware, cutlery, and the table cloths.  The entire staff, every single staff member, helped us turn the place upside down after hours in their own time off. They volunteered once their shifts were over since they could see how distraught my wife and I were. Well after almost two hours of sifting through trash and linen hampers we finally found my wives ring. Through tears of joy we thanked everyone who helped  I owe this staff my gratitude and I will not forget any of them for their efforts. Truely touched our hearts and restored faith in humanity",

I love the decor and the ambiance makes me feel nostalgic and right at home. The owners Ryan and Dan are always there and are accommodating to their patrons. Derek, the lead mixologist and Sarah their top food server are so professional, I can not be more happy with my experience everytime I pay them a visit. Highly recommended and you will not be let down! Scallops, oysters (east and west coast) and cornbread for dinner is one of their best on the menu and their specials on mimosas are incredibly delicious for your weekend brunch! You can't help but make this your regular go-to restaurant!",

I went downstairs to the Kennison and sat at the bar, which needed a good wipe down yet there were barely any customers present...so it should have been taken care of prior to me sitting down. The bartender stopped his personal conversation with his friend seated at the bar to take my order. I ordered a glass of white wine and put in my to-go order for the Fried Chicken Sandwich. The wine was delish albeit a small pour. I sat rolling my eyes while the bartender and his friend discussed breakup tactics and whether they prefer to be broken up with or if they prefer to be the heartbreaker. I don't think personal conversations like that should happen in front of customers. It is very unprofessional. My order came out very quickly already packed in a brown paper bag with utensils and napkins. I am not going to lie: I was pumped about my sandwich and tv plans. I finished my wine and headed back to my room. I was really disappointed when I opened my food order and noticed that the kimchi slaw that was listed as a side was not included in my takeout container. There were a lot of fries but I was really wanting to try that slaw. The chicken was flavorful but on the greasier side, instead of totally crispy. Based on this experience, I would pick another spot in Lincoln Park even if you are staying at the Hotel Lincoln.",

Menu is very small (1 page), but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing - but in that case one would expect the dishes to be excellent quality with some special flavor/presentation etc to it, and it was not the case.

The food is tasty, as we had brunch, so the bacon was nicely cooked, egg dishes were nicely made and appearance artful, and drinks well made. It was all a 5 star rating until I saw the bill - mine alone was over 40% of the bill with a party of 10 people. The drinks were most of my costs and it was a simple screwdriver. If I do come next time again, I won't be drinking anything except for 1 drink and water. Night clubs are cheaper on mixed drinks.  Also, our waiter, though he was decent, didn't really come around too much, only to serve us the expensive drinks when they are low in quantity. I didn't like this pre, during and post.  Regardless, it's a nice setting on a Saturday. I think there's valet parking, bathrooms are in the way back somewhere (I had to ask twice), and again, plenty of seating, so the wait time is probably not that bad.  But again, service is iffy and drinks are expensive - next time I'll bring my own. Or just drink water, if they don't charge for that.",

        "caption": "There are lots of great reviews on here and appetizing pics of dishes.  However, my experience at the Kennison this past weekend left more to be desired.  1. The serving staff\u2019s dress was very unprofessional. The manager had on jeans and cowboy boots, the table servers had an assortment of footware from white sneakers, to mountain boots, and there was an obvious theme missing with how they should all look.  2. Our waiter had an extremely poor concept of time. After seating us we waited 20 minutes to order and the space was not full, so he wasn\u2019t overly busy.  It was to the point where we asked another staff member to take our order, but he looked like he was still in high school and told us sorry he couldn\u2019t as he laughed. He would have left it at that had I not suggested he then get out waiter. Upon our waiter finally arriving we felt we needed to order everything at once just to be safe. So, we were then filling his note sheet with scribble.  3. We ordered the beef tar tar and olives to start. Both were good. But the waiter expected me to keep my used beef fork for my main dish. In which I said I\u2019d like a new one. So, I was brought a new one, but my wife did not get the same option. You should not have to ask for a new fork! Especially when you leave/put your used one on the discarded plate.  4.  My wife ordered the steak frites $28. In which if you\u2019ve ever had frites. This came out as a 1 big hunk of ribeye steak. Nothing as expected! With more fat than meat and the fat was not the sort of thing where you could cut around it. It ran throughout the entire steak making it impossible to really eat. So my wife really did not eat.  5. I ordered the double burger, but instead of getting the option to choose how the meat was to be prepared I was told it would be prepared medium. It was not the sort of thing where it was the chef\u2019s recommendation for temp. I was told. So, I was left felling like I had no choice.  6. At the end of the meal I was hoping the manager would make her rounds to our table before our plates were cleared, so my wife could explain how she was not able to cut into her steak (virtually leaving the entire thing in tact) however she did not come until it was time to pay and all she simply did was drop off the check. Not once asked us how everything was.  7. One would think if you leave an 8oz steak on your plate someone should be telling someone and someone should be inquiring to the guest how everything was, but nothing.  With 100\u2019s of options in the city that offer better, more experienced, standardized-professional, and attentative table service. More/higher quality menue options, and overall better quality experience I think we will have to pass on returning to this spot.  Which is a shame because like I said it has great reviews and some of the menue options look good. However, one bad experience is all it takes when you have unlimited choices.",

Service was atrocious. Failed to put in half of drink order for brunch, and 1st round took 10 min (while bartender was standing polishing glasses). Portions were even smaller than last time. Bread pudding was divine but only 6 small bites (for $13). Chilaquiles was mediocre. Egg dishes were fine, but not impressive. Waitress couldn't keep coffee full. And would have to be reminded over and over for a refill (both waters and coffee)... Unlikely to return at this point.",

The place was empty, nevertheless we were pressured to sit at a high top table and to order everything in one shot because \"we have so many parties coming in, the chef doesn't want to make you wait for your food.\" So we did that. Then our water ran out and we were ignored by the staff. I got up and fetched my own water, it was the only thing to do. When they saw me do that, they hid from making eye contact. But then we were then OVER served, with every single person coming over interrupting us asking questions.  The food? Unimpressive. The burger was thin patties, nothing special. The chicken sandwich was uninspired. There were three different pasta options, all rather pretentious. We wound up ordering the one that was sold as, no kidding: \"like walking through a forest on a fall day.\" It's made from lichens. This isn't an American classic, as this place advertises.  The cocktails were good. It's a shame our waiter didn't want to sell us more, but since we just wanted to get out of there, it's probably for the best.  $70 for bad service and blah food. Can't come back.",

We had delicious happy hour oysters, prosecco, split a salad and for entrees, the salmon cooked a perfect medium rare, and a filet mignon that was also perfectly cooked to medium (can't digest medium rare anymore). The manager and chef comped us to a real treat, which was the pappardelle rabbit pasta, truly the best \"dessert\" we have ever had although not intended as a dessert. Mike our server was fantastic as well as John the asst mgr and Charles gave us great tips on hot spots in Chicago. We adored the friendly staff and spectacular food. While pricier than J Parker's rooftop bar atop the hotel, the food at Kennison's is more innovative and much higher quality.",

My husband and daughter ordered beef and pasta, and found the same lackluster experience in their entrees as well.  With so many other  better options in the old town Lincoln park area. I would pass on this restaurant.",
