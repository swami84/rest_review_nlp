In reality, the Brisket is over salted, the slaw is a vinegary overkill, and the pickles have a kick that shouldn't hit so hard. It's a fine hot meal but not the Best BBQ in Chicago. All 6 sauces are the wrong consistency as they try to take on multiple's regionalities specialties, they don't even \"nail\" Chicago BBQ Sauce. You will most likely spill one of these soupy consistency dippers on your chest on your way to your mouth. This Lunch Spot is the Benihana of the cafeteria style dining environment it lives in but the Chipotle of Barbecue as far as Chicago is concerned. There should be a larger point deduction based on the lack of bathrooms and staff suggestion to \"buy something at McDonald's and use theirs.\" If you work in the building, befriend the staff for a few extra ounces of meat at lunchtime, if you're a tourist pick a BBQ Spot with its own door, you'll thank me in the morning.",

Michigan Ave & South Water, Lake and Wells, and Clinton and Madison)  You can order your brisket one of three ways: Fatty, Regular, or Lean. Brisket is a cut of beef that has a significant amount of fat to it, which can be a turn off for some. Fatty is basically the brisket sliced and served to you - nothing reduced. Lean is just that - no fat. and I believe (because I have order it this way) regular is a mix of fatty and lean; essentially, less fat.  On to the sauces... Honestly, if you're getting brisket - don't add any sauce. The brisket is so good it can stand on its own.  But if you must know, Blackwood has a series of BBQ sauces you can choose to apply to your meats. I used to get the Chicago (sweet and spicy). You can also opt for Memphis (sweeter), Kansas City (spicier), North carolina (vinegar based), South Carolina (mustard based), or Alabama (\"White sauce in the  celebrated Southern style\"). But honestly - if you're getting brisket - don't add any sauce. The brisket is so good it can stand on its own.",
