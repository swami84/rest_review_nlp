We got the excellent Szechuan \ud83c\udf46 and \ud83d\udc16 belly \ud83c\udf2e with annato-hued rice and black beans. Soft \ud83c\udf2e shells were perfectly warmed with slightly crisp edges. We had haupia topped with persimmon and lilikoi for dessert. I'll have to come back to try the peppered beef and chicken \ud83c\udf2e options, as well as the tomatillo stew!",

The pork belly tacos were the stars but the braised beef was delicious as well.  The rice and beans were a little under seasoned but good overall.  Definitely an interesting take on tacos and and surprisingly good!",
