I've ordered here at least once a month (but usually more than that) since they opened, and everything is consistently awesome. Nothing is ever watery or bland. Their chutneys are so good, their garlic naan perfect, and all of their vegetarian appetizers and entrees are amazing. I usually get yellow daal, malai kofta, daal saag, or saag paneer for my meal. They always include a little container of kheer (rice pudding), and everyone there is super nice. Best Indian food restaurant in Brooklyn!",

After my meal tonight, I believe I\u2019ve found it. Definitely a bit of an expense, would love to see a dinner or lunch special (sorry if I didn\u2019t see one and they are available options). However it\u2019s worth every penny. Delivery was early. Ordered the Chettinad (non creamy & spicy) and the chicken was succulent and soft. Reminded me of my dad\u2019s homemade curry! The Garlic Naan was buttery and delicious and a great size for one person to have some leftovers, although I definitely ate the whole thing in one sitting. The Raita (god, why is it so hard to find good raita in this city?!) was perfect. We also got the chicken tikka which was not spicy and a bit sweet (but my roommates loved it). You can consider this my love letter to Indika House. Looking forward to ordering here again.",

Other things we ordered Veg samosa, just ok, kind of mushy inside  Aloo gobi: watery and just flavor of chili powder, even tho we ordered mild  Yellow dal: watery and just flavor of chili powder, spicy even tho I ordered mild  Chicken tikka masala: yes white meat, but doesn't seem like tandoori chicken. Again, sauce watery and not flavorful at all.  Lamb Josh: kind of ok I guess, not really much flavor  Rice: ok, normal basmati  Overall everything is just watery! It all lacks the complex flavors of Indian spices and all you taste is chili powder.  I wouldn't order from here again.",

I tried using the condiments that where sent to enhance the flavors but it did not work.  Except for the shrimps!

First of all, even though we are in the midst of Covid-19, if you live in this neighborhood, take your time to go here and do a pick up order. It's a shame we can't do indoor eats right now because the look of this place is so progressive, niche and being overlooked by everyone. If you know anything about Brooklyn culture, this place is 100% representative as to what that is; the walls are filled with extensive and breathtaking murals, the fixtures are rustic yet modern and even the furnishing is genuine to Indian culture. The food is full of flavor and authentic beyond a doubt. I've ordered about 10 dishes from here now and I have never been dissapointed. Nothing tastes generic or like any other restaurant.  Each dish has it's own specific flavor, which I promise you, rivals on your previous favorite version of it from any other place, maybe even your mother's kitchen! Finally, the staff is so friendly and super accommodating. I walked in and talked to the owner and felt like I was talking to a friend. At the end of our conversation, he gave me a voucher for a discount next time I eat there, you can tell he really cares about his clients and business; it's always a pleasure to support hard working, honest people and the local small business owner. This restaurant has only been open for a few months now and is already my favorite Indian spot in the whole city. Try it and you'll understand why.",
