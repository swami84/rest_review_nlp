Reasons being that I don't think it's fair for both the business and people looking at reviews since I technically didn't have the full experience (actual setting, service, etc). As ~pretentious~ as that sounds, this spot became an exception! I was hungry af the other day at 11pm and ordered a chicken bowl from here on Grubhub. Took a while to come but oh boy it was delicious. Can't say much about the ramen or other bowls but solely the chicken bowl alone is enough reason for me to reorder. The chicken was flavorful and there was a lot of chicken, like A LOT. Cucumber and avocado were definitely crucial to the dish and I actually wish there were more of those and less chicken. Kind of surprised to see this place with low ratings but again, I only tried the chicken bowl. I'd suggest trying that if you aren't sure what to get.  Overall I think the food was good enough that I am currently hoping to try it again!",

She wasn\u2019t willing to let me create my own bowl and had the a really look on her face...talk about bad customer service...ugh. If you want really good sushi and the best poke bowl in queens with awesome customer service try Yo fresh shogun sushi down the block. Trust me you won\u2019t regret it. The owner set the bar so hi with his banging sushi and great customer service.",

        "caption": "Horrible!  First of all where do I even begin? Let's see, maybe from the second I walked in they had a loincloth hanging behind the counter blocking the view to the cooking area...?!  Why? The guy cooking had no hat or hairnet on.... maybe thats why I threw up from pube ingestion after the second forkfull! The chef in addition was screaming chinese ying yang mumbo jumbo while he was cooking as i could and did peek through the loincloth opening.  I cant stand when people talk over my food.  I damn sure don't need your spit drones crash landing in my Doggone udons!!!! That said, these people are DEFINATELY NOT Japanese!!! They have No Honor! A true Shogun would NEVER allow his/her Shinto Shrine to operate in this disgraceful manner. I would NEVER eat here again and suggest you do the same if you want to keep your digestive system in tact. Yuck Yuck YUCK! I wish i could rate them negative stars but unfortunately I had to rate them one star to write this totally awesome & true review.",
