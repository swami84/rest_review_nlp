I didn\u2019t get my food until around 9:00pm. As a member of the restaurant industry, if my customers waited 2 hours for their food I would have at LEAST made the bill half off, or offered free dessert, or SOMETHING. Anything! The restaurant is quite dysfunctional and unorganized. I regret choosing this restaurant for my birthday. I will never come here again.",

She was very rude to us for absolutely no reason. She said that I had missed my reservation...which I had not, and I explained to her that I didn\u2019t. I guess no one passed along the fact that I had called the restaurant hours earlier to change my reservation. Anyway, another friend came with us and then the hostess said there was no way she could seat us because we had an extra person in the party. I totally understood that and my friends and I walked out of there and went to another restaurant. It wasn\u2019t a big deal. The problem was that in speaking to my party, the hostess was extremely rude and snappy with us when we were on very chill energy. Firstly, I didn\u2019t miss my reservation...so no reason to be rude about it. Secondly, if you couldn\u2019t seat us because of the extra person that\u2019s totally fine...but there\u2019s a way to speak with customers in a respectful manner. It was unfortunate b/c my friends and I were looking forward to eating there and would\u2019ve tried to make a reservation for another day.

        "caption": "Honest review. I was skeptical initially.  Pros: The food was VERY good and I am a tough critic . My partner and I ordered the egg rolls , wings , shrimp and grits and rib eye ( side of mashed potatoes and asparagus). Yum yum yum! Typical DC prices.  Service was great! I loved my server Kenisha. Everyone was very personable and accommodating.  Cons: The ambiance and decor need a major revamp. Dive Bar floors - yet a day party feel in the middle . Not great lighting in general. For the price, I was expecting a more polished decor.  The bathroom was not well maintained and the lock was broke. Received an unwelcome guest which was upsetting as I did not know the lock did not actually work.  Music is really explicit and could potentially offend guest . I mean , I was down to turn up but know your audience. The edited versions will suffice.  However , the cons were not enough to discourage me from returning . I\u2019ll be back to support black business and eat good again!!! Try it for yourself like we did. We were not disappointed!",

Because there is NO WAY anyone with taste buds would give 5 stars.  My party of 4 arrived at 4:30pm and the brunch crowd was just starting to clear out. Every table seemed to be having a good time! However, for us, not so much. One person ordered the snapper, which had a pretty presentation, unfortunately, it lacked flavor. The Mac and cheese tasted like nothing (literally had to add salt/pepper/ and hot sauce for it to be eatable) & the dirty rice was nothing spectacular. The corn bread tasted more like cake but it was good.  the jambalaya? Ha, don\u2019t even waste your time or calories!! Another friend of mine ordered the steak MEDIUM well. However, when she got it, it was so over cooked she couldn\u2019t even cut into it.  I got the lamb chops (very small portion) with mashed potatoes and the \u201cveggies of day\u201d which was really just corn mixed with a few pieces of onions, broccoli and mushrooms. My lamb wasn\u2019t half bad and the mashed potatoes was probably the most seasoned thing on our table. However. After taxes, I paid 52$ for my meal (not including drinks) so I would not say it was worth it  As a young professional, I do not mind paying top notch for my food. Like others have said, this place is expensive yet lacks the quality and portions are extremely small. I would suggest they hire a new chef.  The decor is pretty and the people from brunch seemed to have had a great time. Because this is black owned I MAY come back for brunch and just get drinks. Again, the only reason I gave them 2 stars was solely because the waiter was extremely nice.",

I ordered the Voodoo Storm which i don't recommend and my sister had Miss Nola. First off the glass had red lipstick on the brim from a previous user because she had no lipstick on. We ordered fried green tomatoes and had to ask for small plates and napkins. Waiter brought us out dirty plates and napkins we asked for another set by the time that came our starter was cold. We spoke to someone who states he was the supervisor or assistant manager not to sure of his title. He apologized to us and made us some fresh tomatoes and brought our new drinks in to go cups. So moving forward we order our food. The lamb and plantains were awesome. Mac n cheese was to garlicky and onionly so he took that off for us. When we got the bill we were charged for drinks that were supposed to be taken off so we had to wait another 20 mins for that. Then they ran receipt paper and we had to take a pic on our phone. We sat down at 737pm and did not leave until 10pm. The service was extremely slow. Management did not take care of us and we spent 160.00. On top of that we travelled from Timonium/Lutherville area just to be disappointed. Our girls night out was ruined. I can see the potential in this place but the service is horrible and something needs to be done.",

However, I was left very unsatisfied and didn't even get the chance to taste all of the food or drink options I set out to try. We were greeted and seated right away but as far as our drinks and food (appetizers), they took longer than expected. It took 40 minutes for drinks and then our food came another 40 minutes after. The spinach dip is more of a saut\u00e9ed spinach bowl but the pita chips that accompanied them were delicious. The crab fries were okay. I would recommend making the fries thicker and adding a bit more seasoning and crab meat. The crab claws (took the longest at 1hour and 15 minutes) to arrive at the table. They were very small and I was underwhelmed at the presentation. In terms of the crab mac and cheese, yes there was an overwhelming amount of cheese but it lacked seasoning. I had plans to order an entree as well as a dessert but due to the long wait times I changed my mind. Lastly, the staff may need additional training, we were told that the crab claws were on the happy hour menu but it turned out they weren't and despite the horrid experience, they were not discounted. Sadly I do not think I nor my friends will be returning.",

The menu lures you in with all of the different options that appeal to your taste buds. You can't help but feeling like it is a must to order everything. We noticed many tables around us kept ordering several items on the menu which confirmed their sharing of the same feelings about the menu. We even thought one table with only two people ordered all but two things on the menu \ud83e\udd23.  We settled on crab claws as a starter which were flavored perfectly and our first crab claws dish. For your entre you won't be disappointed with the ribeye or the shrimp creole. When it was all said and done both of our plates were clear and totally cleaned. The food is perfectly seasoned and although it says creole the dishes aren't overly spicy, which is perfect for me the non spicy girl. End your meal with the bread pudding. Although the scoop of ice cream could be a tad bigger the hot bread pudding  with whisky caramel and vanilla ice cream is a perfect combination and way to end the evening. Everything was absolutely delicious \ud83d\ude0b \ud83d\udcaf\u2764. We will be back soon for sure, of course we have to try something new on the menu #blackownedbusiness #fallynsfoodieexcursions #fallynsfoodieexcursionscovid19edition",

I don't feel comfortable coming back though until I see that they've stepped up their COVID-19 safeguards and when the team there has worked out their operational kinks.  COVID-19 Precautions: Outdoor and Indoor seating were extremely dense. I doubt all of the tables were 6 -feet apart. I also saw patrons sitting at the bar when there were bartenders working. They allowed people waiting for tables to queue up indoors as well with no social distancing. Most of the staff were wearing masks which was good. For a new local restaurant opening up in the worst impacted neighborhood in DC, I expected a bit more in this area.  Food: The food was delicious, I had the Creole Bird, the chicken was delicious and well cooked, the seasoning on top was delicious. Mashed Potato sides I got was very average though the 'Dirty Rice' side was spot on. The French Fries were delicious as well. Not many gluten free options, but vegetarians should find a few items they can enjoy.  Pricing: So you can expect a price range of $20-$60 per person w/o drinks included. The sandwiches will give you the best value while some of the seafood entrees get pricey, though pretty standard for the area. My recommendation here is to skip the chicken entrees (~$20) as you can find more delicious chicken dishes at the nearby Latinx cuisines for a little bit less.  Experience: It's a brand new restaurant during a soft opening, so there were some kinks to work out. It took us a while to finally pay for our takeout but again, this is to be expected for a new restaurant. Couple things that left me on a sour note though, I paid $2 more to get the chicken stuffed with Spinach and Cheese and that didn't happen. And we were supposed to get a 10% neighborhood welcome discount, that was not applied to our bill, I should've noticed this so I'll chalk this up to being my fault.",
