The \"Boneless Spare Ribs w/white  rice\" dish in this restaurant is 'to die for.'  Other dishes in this restaurant [\"Fu Lai Kitchen\"] are prepared extremely well too. I gave this Chinese restaurant 5 stars because of how the cook prepares all dishes, the great customer support I receive upon entry into the restaurant or over the phone, and the always clean tables I see before me if I decide to eat inside the restaurant. PLUS, one receives a FREE CAN OF SODA upon ordering a dish. I've never been to a Chinese restaurant that does this. Believe me, the cooked food, no matter what you order, is really great -- I've been to many Chinese restaurants in different boroughs, and this restaurant in Bay Ridge Brooklyn is by far the best I have ever visited.  Delivery time:  Average (depends on how far away you live from the restaurant). <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  November 16th, 2020, *********************** Due to this ratchet virus that reared its literal spiky head in January of 2020, which attaches itself to healthy human cells by piercing them with their sharp, crown-like properties (thus the name \"coronavirus\"),  a.k.a.:  \"COVID-19\" (SARS-CoV-2), indoor dining became a thing of the past and normal life, even if a vaccine with 95% efficacy will come to bear, this normal life we've known since the last pandemic of 1918, which killed millions and most likely originated in North America, will return in 2022 at the earliest. Anywho, this restaurant's delivery service is fully intact and do not be wary of eating out, as I have and my lungs are still working. STAFF WEARS THE NECESSARY PPE REQUIRED FOR RESTAURANTS AT ALL TIME. FULL SPEED AHEAD is \"Fu Lai Kitchen's\" motto. GREAT RESTAURANT EVEN DURING A WORLD-WIDE PANDEMIC.",
