On short notice we were able to eat at Mim's on New Year's eve several years ago and had a delicious affordable meal.  Of special note are their main dish salads, their fantastic pasta dishes, and the scrumptious desserts.  The servers are great and it's a nice comfortable place where you can have a conversation with friends. Don't miss a meal there!  And the prices are very reasonable. And if you are like us, afraid to go out due to CoVid, the takeout options are a super deal and the food is just as good as inside. We look forward to returning to the restaurant when it's safe.",

When the bill came noticed that they didn\u2019t include the orange juice. Good.  Here is the twist. Had ordered Hennessy for adults and it didn\u2019t taste like Henny. So told them it\u2019s not Hennny. Just wanted to make sure so I went to the bar and asked for another Hennessy. The bartender replied ok and vanished from the bar . Waited patiently for 3+ min and she came back and said she checked the basement and couldn\u2019t find any more Hennessy. I said THANK YOU. Then came the receipt with added TIP wrote down by the waitress in addition to the service charge they already charged. I understand the service charge, Because we were total 11 ppl but I never see an employee fill out the tip by themselves. Seriously??? First she said get the calculator and next second she realized she was wrong. Then comes the usual apology and she said this was the first time.  I wanted to tip them extra because of the pandemic, but when asked why did she do that she said they just started doing this today. Hearing that I thanked them saying I am going to do this review and will never come here again.  The owner did reply as usual. He said they got a new system. I don\u2019t mind. But if the employees are not trained with the new system they shouldn\u2019t write down the tip by themselves. Also to the owner it wasn\u2019t henny you guys gave us.",

We go a few times a year and love it every time. Great variety and never disappointed. When I found myself in the Roslyn area last week, I decided to order takeout from their Family Deals. Figured it wouldn\u2019t be as good as when we dine in but still a nice change from our normal takeout. I was wrong!!  The portions were great (especially for the price) and everything was packaged well. Still hot when I got home 20 minutes later. Food quality seems to be the same as always. I, of course,didn\u2019t have much interaction with the staff but it was ready exactly when I asked for it. Can\u2019t ask for more. Thanks for staying open!  (I also noticed on their website they offer a big discount to front line health care workers.  Next time I\u2019ll send my wife who works at NUMC. I\u2019ll save some money and get great food from a local business.)",

We had the saut\u00e9ed chicken with mozzarella & tomatoes, mustard grilled salmon & marinated steak for entrees. Mac & cheese was the best anyone had ever had from a restaurant. Mixed veggies were fabulous & caesar salad was great too. They included rolls.  The catering manager Jimmy made it all so easy. Chef put in his recommendations on food amounts which were PERFECT-barely any leftovers which made us a little sad haha! You really can\u2019t beat $600 for a REALLY nice catered dinner for 40 people. A HUGE thank you to the entire Mim\u2019s team for impressing the hell out of me, my husband & our entire family. The food absolutely made the party.  By the way, it\u2019s a girl!!",

The hostess overlooked me by greeting and attending to the group behind me. I graciously stepped out of their way and allowed them to be pass to be seated. The hostess again greeted the next group behind me to which I interrupted her this time and told her that I too was waiting to be helped. She acted surprise as if she was seeing me for the first time. This was a racial related incident for sure\u2639.  Thanks for your response below, but it took you two months to knowledgeable and respond to my concern whereas, you responded immediately to other reviews. I have been in your restaurant at least six times and have always been greeted and picked up orders at the reception desk, NEVER at the bar. I have never been allowed pass the reception area in the front. I will say that on the above visit was the first time I experienced such distasteful treatment,  so I'll call it an isolated or one-off incident. As for diverse and multicultural....never seen it....only the valet attendant. I will say though that your food smells delicious...too bad I'll never taste it.",

Best cosmos, bread, hummus , salad, burata, lemon sole oreganata, fish , chicken, steak prepared any and all ways.. desserts that are to die for.. and the list goes on.  People go out to eat for a good meal. Which you will absolutely have:get  at Mim's.. but one gets so much more here. The most incredible staff and people are all under one roof. No doubt all the servers are great, but Angela is my personal favorite. She\u2019s Amazing..And then some!  Last but not least . A big shout out and Thank  you to Jimmy. Mim\u2019s is what is is  because of  him! Jimmy goes above and beyond to make sure Everyone is happy and all  their needs and wants are met.. He is truly so rare, terrific  snd special. How lucky Mims and all of us are to have him!!  Will be back soon! And if  you\u2019re reading this review and stressing where to go.. look no further.. Go to Mim\u2019s. You won\u2019t be disappointed!  This posting was done a while ago. Well I\u2019m happy to say some things don\u2019t change. Repeat to Everything in my previous review  Mims is still THE BEST! Still my favorite place to come to dine, drink, and have the BEST time, meal and drinks. Still the best staff ever... and still especially Jimmy and Angela. I love you both . When they made you they broke the mole. You truly are the best in every way!! Mims, every diner, I, and this world..are so lucky to have you in it! Tommy, Sean and Ivan..

There is a good-sized bar with dining so you can watch the latest sporting event and several dining areas, including big comfy booths too. Mim's hosts themed dining nights as well as fun events like Psychic Nights and Murder Mystery Dinners.  The event nights are usually priced-fixed with a set menu, offering you several quality choices in appetizers, main courses, and dessert. When we dine here on other nights we have also enjoyed their barbeque special as Southern cooking with Mac n Cheese and ribs, don't get any better according to our son, a big fan of everything bbq. I always enjoy their steaks, and on several lucky nights, their dinner special has been a delicious lamb selection. I always go for their Brussel Sprouts, and you won't be disappointed either especially if you like them roasted crispy. For dessert, they have a make your own smores, always a favorite family item or their cheesecake and pies are outstanding. Another comfort here is both a pleasant and accommodating staff as well as a great atmosphere. No matter the crowd Mim's draws and serves; the valet takes your car, the server promptly starts your drink order and kitchen turn around time is appropriately spaced between courses even on event nights. I have also picked up restaurant gift cards here for my friends, and they also have an excellent lunch menu too!  While I am not psychic, I can predict a great meal and an enjoyable night awaits you at Mim's!",

They have a price fixed dinner until 6:30pm that's a fabulous deal, but they don't always tell you about it.  Ask and you shall receive a great meal with appetizer and dessert for only a few dollars more than the main course alone.  Service was good, valet parking... The only complaint I have is that they served the Juniors cheesecake ice cold.  Otherwise we had a great time and we will be back!",

I'm thrilled I took them up on the invitation. They were having a steak evening so we decided to go with that accompanied by salads and burgers for the kids. The food was great and the service as well. Everything seemed to fall in line with the first experience we'd had with them. The steaks we're cooked properly, the burgers too and my son's Mac & Cheese won out over his burger. I missed taking pictures of the desserts but the Oreo mousse and apple crumble were tasty too.

I was unable to eat my dinner. My friends angel hair pasta was way to buttery, and just like me, she couldn\u2019t eat hers either. The sweet potato fries did NOT taste like a sweet potato at all. They tasted artificial. And finally, our burnt broccoli was soggy and not burnt whatsoever. It was soaked in cheese and butter, which is definitely not how we ordered it. Due to this restaurant, my friends parents had to buy us a whole new meal from Bryant and Cooper, which is expensive. That means, we spent a LOT of money on our dinner tonight for no reason. I would not recommend ever getting breakfast, lunch, or dinner from Mim\u2019s restaurant. Btw, I would have rated this with 0 stars but that is not possible.",

The reviews were outstanding so I expected a pleasant, trouble free evening of good food, pleasant service and comfortable surroundings.  The best I can say is almost.      While the service was mostly attentive and the food was very good for many, others were less than satisfied.  4 adults had soup or salad and an entree and the children had pasta and chicken parm that they loved.  The biggest issue was that the Chicken pot pie crust was charred and, even though it was very hot, the potatoes were under cooked, a real issue for my wife who is severely allergic to under cooked potatoes. I should have suspected an issue when our entrees were taking a unusual amount of time.  The waitress did come by to acknowledged that they were taking long and that she would check why.  My guess is they were waiting for the pot pie as the sides for the others were at best warm and they forgot shrimp add on. Finally, we were just unlucky to be seated next to a party of eight that were extremely loud but that is more a comment about our culture that the restaurant. Overall it was not a bad experience. The restaurant did not charge for the pot pie and the shrimp they originally forgot to add to the pasta primavera.  We had drinks and a bottle of wine and except for pot pie and warm sides enjoyed the rest of the entrees.  We will give Mim's another try and hopefully they will live up to their reviews at that time.",

I came in for my first day of training on a Wednesday and everything went well. Jimmy the manager had told me to return on Thursday and Friday at 4pm. I showed up on Thursday and at the end of my shift I was reminded to come back the next day. On Friday at 3:55pm Jimmy called me not to come in and mentioned how he could not accommodate me in the schedule. Meanwhile I was outside the parking lot, after making the 45 minute commute through rush hour to get there. I called back to ask about pay for the shifts I have completed.  I was put on hold for 10 minutes and was told by Trisha that Jimmy \u201cstepped out\u201d.  I left a message with Trisha and never received a call back. I proceeded to call back two more times on different days. As soon as I mentioned who I was and who I wanted to speak to, I would get the run around \u201cJimmy is not here\u201d or \u201cJimmy stepped out\u201d.  Not only did I waste my time and energy, I wasted my money on a $60 uniform that I cannot return because It was used for the two days of training. Mims is the most unprofessional place I\u2019ve ever came across.  I had to contact the Department of Labor due to the irresponsibility of a manager. I do not encourage anybody to apply here. Your time and money will be wasted.  I also don\u2019t encourage costumers to eat at an establishment who mistreats their employees. If I could give this restaurant 0 stars or even negative stars, I would.",

The decor on the inside is very nice, subdued and gives an elegant feel without being extravagant. I ordered the meatloaf and my wife had the sauteed chicken. Both dishes were very good. The potatoes were excellent, with a crispy skin (but not dry!) and soft interior. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cake with oreo crumb topping. By this point I was full so I had a couple of spoonfuls of cake and it tasted good. Full disclosure I'm very picky about desserts. My son finished my cake in about two minutes, so he highly recommends it. The service was good but I would expect the server to be able to pay close attention to a table in a mostly empty restaurant on a  Thursday afternoon. Overall I liked Mim's and i would definitely eat there again if I am in the area.",
