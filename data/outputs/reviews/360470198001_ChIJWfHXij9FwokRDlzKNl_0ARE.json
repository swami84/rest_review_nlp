Everyone was so nice, we got sake & the woman kept pouring it for us but then again she did it so often that it felt like she was trying to get us drunk lol.. when we finished the sake, she was like 2 more, right & didn't even wait for an answer. The food was meh.. we got the beef negamaki appetizer which was bad. It was mush on the inside & the meat was overcooked, dry & krispy. I like my meat medium rare. The roll we got was actually not so bad. I honestly can't remember the name, perhaps because we had 4 bottles of large sake lol.. but it was an eel type one. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Why there are grapes & sting beans hanging from the ceiling is beyond me but whatever.. I wish I could say I reccomend this place, but I wouldn't. If you must have sushi & it's not only late but you're right there & can't travel towards 86th street where there's way better places, then sure, I guess go here.",

They gave me a hard time with substituting some of the rolls or changing them around, told me that it was just assorted and I couldn't choose for the box combo which is a first because every other place I've been to have always been able to choose my rolls. Portion size was kind of small. Taste of the food was okay I guess though I didn't particularly care for the sashimi. Won't be going back here",

It looks as though it was left over from an Italian restaurant whereas there are artificial grapes and what looks like zucchini hanging from a trellis overhead. They could use a little sprucing up. Also, they don't use glass dishes or china. They use melmac and the chopsticks they give you are disposable wooden ones, not plastic. However, as I started out saying, their food is very good and well priced. After reading one of the reviews, I realized that the young man who wrote the review is not reviewing Fujiyama on 13th avenue because the restaurant is nothing like he described.",

Let us start with the owner. He is personable, approachable, and available every time we have dined here. He cares for each of his customers and builds relationships with those that dine frequently.  Next, the atmosphere; the attention to detail is apparent. Fujiyama is always busy, but they continue to investment money into the restaurant on improvements from the seating and tables to the uniforms of the staff. One section upstairs was just updated with custom booths, tables and chairs. They could have easily just left it the way it was, as they were still pulling a lot of customers into the place to the point there is always people waiting for tables. Another recent upgrade is the outside area near the downstairs entrance to the Hibachi restaurant. There is a beautiful outside waiting area with benches and gorgeous landscaping.  Food! oh the food! The Hibachi part is your typical hibachi style restaurant with great food and service, but I will concentrate on the upstairs restaurant. The menu is made up of mostly Japanese dishes with some Korean selections. Can't say I have tried all the items, but I have tried dozens. There is not one dish I ordered that didn't taste great with fresh and authentic ingredients. I have been lucky to eat some fabulous Japanese and Korea dishes in Japan, Korea and other parts of the world and can clearly state Fujiyama measures up with the best. Sushi and Sashimi is always fresh and portions are usually generous. As for the rolls, there are plenty of options and you will find many that will fancy your taste buds. Some are very creative combinations. For me, there is nothing better than ordering a new roll and allowing the first taste to be slow, enjoying the various textures of the ingredients and various stages of taste as the ingredients combine together in your mouth. Some of my favorites include; Angry Dragon, 4 Seasons, Playboy, Hot Pepper Lorenzer, Hurricane, Mansfield, and Dynamite.  My wife and I considered ourselves very lucky to have lived so close to this restaurant. OVERALL: it is a wonderful dinning experience. Normally, I don't write reviews and why promote a restaurant I love, which might make it even more busy? But, after dining here for 5 years, I can safely say it is hands down the best restaurant my wife and I have been to.",
