You could taste the oil, which the oil tasted as if other items were fried into as well. I couldn\u2019t bare to eat it. I paid for it and I left.  Also, most places serve a small amount of fruit with it but for $10.00 you\u2019ll get fried bread in old oil. The server also brought a small jar of syrup which it was sticky and the lid had fuss and dust stick on. I gave it a star because service was sympathetic. I would not recommend this place to anyone, or at least the French toast.  Try this place at your own risk.",

So 30min went by and no phone call. Asked the hostess again about the wait and she said another 15min. That\u2019s when we started noticing that people who had been sitting for quite some time still hadn\u2019t got their food or even placed orders. We decided to go somewhere else after 45min of waiting. We realized at 8pm last night that we never got a phone call or text about a table being ready (and we forgot to mention to the hostess that we were leaving). Lack of organization seems to be an issue here",

The couple had mentioned that we were actually next, and that's when she decided to take us in.  The food was good, and the service was quick. Not a fan of their iced coffee drinks.

The restaurant had a decent amount of tables and there was no visible grouping separate parties. There is also outdoor (sidewalk) seating available. I ordered the Country Benedict and swapped out the sausage gravy for hollandaise which made it delish. A great Benedict alternative. The service was good, my food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Terry was very attentive and checked to see if everything was ok after the food came out. A plus for coffee lovers, no waiting for refills to be brought around, a small carafe Is brought to your table, refill as much as you like.",

When I got it, there was hair and fibers from a paper towel or cloth on the  bottom. I spent the first few minutes picking fibers off of my sandwhich. I took two bites and decided not to eat it.  I have a picture of the actual dirt that was all over my fruit. I took a piece out and rubbed it between my fingers and there was a streak of brown similar to dried mud.

Then he started asking me how I want my eggs if I wanted hashbrowns or grits etc. So I assumed that it was a meal like you would get at Cracker Barrel or Bob Evens for the same price... I don\u2019t know what happened and I was on the phone with a detective but when I signed for the food it was $25 and some change. How it turned into $25 for a simple 2 egg hashbrowns corned beef hash and pancakes came to $25 beats me... I paid The price of breakfast for two  people.. first time to the restaurant and last. Had I not been on the phone I would have walked out and left the food at that price or asked about it because it wasn\u2019t worth $25 I\u2019ll tell you that!",

When I finally received my food not only was my order wrong but the food tasted horrible. It didn\u2019t taste good, and it didn\u2019t look appetizing either. The second time I went there was a wait, which I didn\u2019t have a problem with since it was a Sunday morning when a lot of people go out with their families. However me and my girlfriend were told that the wait was gonna be 15-30 minutes for two when I could see several open tables. They gave us menus and told us we could sit in chairs and look at what we wanted while we waited. We were fine with waiting but when 3 groups came in after us and were seated before we left. Completely unprofessional restaurant, lacks organization, and honestly seems like it could fall apart at any moment. 1 Star.",

The dining room was spotless, and I had a window booth which allowed for a street view while I was there. A few had chosen to dine on the outdoor sidewalk (one couple had a dog) but I wanted the air-conditioning. Everything about the place felt comfortable, so I know I will return here on future Tampa visits.

The food options were limited to breakfast and lunch, but we found out they do those very well. The Turkey bravo and roast beef sandwich were awesome and the kids french toast was even better. We couldn't have asked for better food. The food was only outclassed by the service. Extremely nice people that we shared stories of our children with. Very glad we chose here and supported these restaurant owners.",

So glad we ate here as we just had wonderful conversations with the owner and waitress.  The food was fabulous!  I took a picture of the fruit that came with my meal because it was so delightful to have something besides just melons in a fruit dish!  This had bananas, strawberries, blueberries,  apples, and yes, some melons.  If I lived in Tampa, I would be here all the time.",

I enjoyed them both, but perhaps you should go their and try those two different options out yourself, to decide. There are lots of various items on their menu to suit another's taste, or preference, while being in a quaint atmosphere, with employee's that are hospitable to their guests. The Samaria Cafe  does close earlier than a late night restaurant, but the restaurant, Samaria Cafe, would be a great place for breakfast, lunch, brunch, or an earlier dinner; if you prefer to have dinner prior to 7:00pm-8:00pm in the evening. The Samaria Cafe also had amazing iced, salted caramel coffee, I indulged in myself; I know it is a little odd to have paired an iced coffee up with the sandwich I provided a photograph of, prior to consuming the delicious food in front of me, on the plate in which I was served my food, but it was fabulous tasting to me, either way.",
