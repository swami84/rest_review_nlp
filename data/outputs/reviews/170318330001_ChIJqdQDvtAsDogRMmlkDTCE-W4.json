We chose the \u201calps\u201d menu (schnitzel, sp\u00e4tzle, red cabbage, and Black Forest cake for dessert) and it was amazing.  The entree required some preparation, mostly reheating, and in case of the schnitzel, reheating in butter, oil and aromatics to ensure it was nice and crisped up.  This may seem a bit more tedious than just picking up food ready-to-eat, but it really made sure the quality and freshness was top notch.  Will definitely do this again, perhaps even trying their alternate menu (Sicilian) soon!  Edited to add: the Sicilian menu was as big of a success, and we also tried the salmon dinner, which was absolutely fantastic. 2 great experiences with Next!",

My fiance loves watching Chef's Table-- and the Grant Achatz episode really floored him. He would always go back to it and watch it again and again. Knowing this, and thinking about his upcoming 41st birthday, I quietly secured a reservation and booked tickets to Chicago.  I'll say this-- we really did not know what to expect. We hadn't ever had a fine dining experience of this caliber before. What we noticed right away was the staff. They made us feel relaxed, taken care of and truly the captains of this experience we were about to embark on. It was a production. Every single little detail was perfect. They even noted that I was left handed and tailored the experience to that small detail.  I won't give anything away about the particulars of the experience as far as dishes go. It was magic. Flooded and floored the senses. I really understand now how this really is art for all the senses. Amanda, our captain, finished this entire experience with inviting us for a tour of their kitchen and a preferred table at the Aviary. The look on my fiance's face at that moment made the 1200 mile trip beyond worth it.  Words cannot express how grateful we are to Amanda, Chef Ed Tinoco and the entire team (so many wonderful people!) for the experience of a lifetime. Thank you so much. All the stars!",

Turns out I was wrong. Tapas was the first course (very nice) and the gazpacho was lovely but after that S.E. Asia was the dominant influence, who knew? It was OK with me as Spanish and Asian are my favorite cuisines. Service was good as always, as was the wine pairing (we opted for the basic lowest priced pairing). As always I have mixed emotions about the price but all in all a very enjoyable evening.",

The theme for this menu was spices from Asia, Middle East, etc. From the start to the finish, it definitely did not disappoint. The service was impeccable. The table behind us was running late, so they were not able to seat us for the reservation. They were so on it, as they took my party to their other restaurant, Roister, next door for a drink so we could wait it out. Very efficient.

I have had the extreme pleasure of experiencing (I use that word purposefully) the last three menus at Next - The French Laundry, Ancient Rome, and Hollywood.  Wow - they all blew me away with the inventiveness, style, yumminess, and courage.  The artistry and theatricality on display during these meals was a pleasure to behold.  Next really seems to have found its groove recently.  While I found some of the original menus - Thai and Bistro - to be fine, they were not exciting.  These last three though are exciting and groundbreaking.  The concept of the dishes is really out there and pushing some interesting envelopes.  In addition to some high wire feats in terms of the dishes, the sheer theatricality and presentation of the meal is a marvel.  I can't wait to go to our next menu (we've got season tickets, and boy am I glad we do) and see what the Chef has in store for us.  I know it's going to be super cool.",

The flatbread course was also a winner, I cleaned my plate to the last crumb. Overall worth it. Not up to Alinea standards, but truly good. I feel like this place is just finding its stride.

For the price I paid, I hardly find any dish outstanding. I agree that some dishes are quite playful, but flavor wise, nothing special. And to me the taste of a dish is the most important. Honestly I cannot think of any memorable flavor from any dish now that it\u2019s been two months from the experience. I had much better nights in other top level fine dining venues throughout this country.  Quite disappointed at the Alinea retro menu. The food was nowhere near bad, but given Alinea\u2019s hype and the price I paid, I would rate it as two stars. Wondering if it was Next\u2019s execution to blame or Alinea\u2019s menu itself.

Ember roasted oysters are presented beautifully and the flavor explosion is certainly one not to miss. Chicken three ways is now going to make all other chicken dinners seem lack luster. Prime rib seasoned only to allow beef flavor to be fully appreciated. The pea salad was simple but elegant and honey roasted quinoa is texitrail genius. Priced reasonably for a FANTASTIC five plus star culinary extravaganza. Simple food elevated and reinvented for a comfortable and exciting foodie evening. Thank you Roister.

We have been there two times already (first time for the partisan theme, second time for the top 50 menu). Some dishes were amazing, and some were ok. However, the experience and company we chose to dine with has always been stellar. The servers are knowledgeable and trained well. We look forward to another experience soon. Pictures from the top 50 menu",

        "caption": "We really wanted to enjoy this more but left underwhelmed.  Maybe comparing to our experiences at Alinea (or similar restaurants) is not fair?  For the price and reputation we expected so much more from the food and the service. We did the French Classique menu for 1 omnivore and 1 pescatarian. All staff were highly aware of the differences in our menus and did a wonderful job of explaining the different preparations. The meal began with an amuse-bouche and wine infused with cantaloupe. It was nice to have a Vin Jaune which is very difficult to find.  The service ware was a real stand out.  Everything from the soup tureens to gold rimmed plates. The food highlight was the lobster and accompaniments. We did not pre-purchase the wine pairings as we prefer reds but when we spoke with the waiter he indicated there were only 2 red wines available. A French Pinot and an Italian Cab Franc. Seemed odd that the second selection was not French or that the selection was very limited. We had a total of 7 courses including the amuse-bouche and dessert. Flavors were good but overall the servings were not generous. Compared to the 15 to 17 courses at Alinea or Oriole this was a miss. In addition to the food, the service was also off. One woman who cleared between courses was relatively abrupt and perfunctory each time she stopped.  Our waiter spilled wine on the table and on the bottom of the glass during the initial pour and did not notice nor clean it off.  I had to use the table cloth to keep wine off my wife's dress. We were not offered a second glass of wine. We were abruptly offered coffee or tea \"black like you had in a Chinese restaurant as a kid\" when we had no idea what course we were on.   3 times someone stepped on my foot under the table. There were no options for an after dinner spirit, port, similar.  Our waiter commented that \"classic French cuisine did not normally do a digestif?\".  We would have also thought for a classic French meal that it might have finished with a salad or a cheese course  Finally, one of my wife's dishes had a hair on the plate. To be fair, the house manager checked if my wife was \"OK\" after we pointed out the hair.  They did comp our wine and eventually put a napkin over the spilled wine after we pointed it out. Maybe it was just an off night but given our expectations and experience at Alinea, we would likely just go back to Alinea instead.",

They often break the barriers of what is considered normal or traditional.  The restaurant is ticket-based. It's a set price due to the set menu. Everything is well-timed and choreographed. There is no rush so you can simply enjoy everything.  The menus have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic pairings. As a non-drinker, I really enjoy the non-alcoholic pairings. Their beverages come from Aviary, which is right next door and is a sister restaurant/bar. Perfect.",

The level of thought and innovation that goes into each meal is unparalleled. While not every dish is going to satisfy every palate, dining here is about the experience and goes beyond the dishes. Each meal is thoughtfully paired so that the dish remains the star and is enhanced by the beverage. Finally, the attention given to each person by the wit staff is incredible, and the knowledge by each server impressive. I have never asked a question that went unanswered.",

Having eaten at some of the worlds best five star restaurants including the one this is based off of, our group as a whole was surprised  that you could not opt for just a glass of wine or an a al carte drink from the bar next door as usual. When we explained that we were driving tonight from the burbs and our DD would like to enjoy one drink they flat out refused. They ALSO refused to split the pairing for the meal. The manager actually came over and basically make me feel like a child....... which i'm obviously not nor do I act in a manner. I didn't want our DD to drink coypus amounts of alcohol and then drive home. After consideration they did allow us to split the pairing which I am currently hung over from. If our Drivers from the group actually completed a full pairing for each..... no way to  legally drive home. I don't really think they care about their client base. WILL NOT BE COMING BACK. I can drop a couple 100  at another restaurant just as fine and still be allowed one drink vs a full 1 to 2 ounce 9 count pairing. They are insane and I have never heard the word NO from a Restaurant like this....",

While their tickets do sell out pretty fast, they will post day off tickets sometime on their facebook page.  If you can get tickets, I would highly recommend going.  I went October 2013, for the Bocuse D'or Menu.  The food was amazing!  it was a great mix of traditional French food with a Midwestern twist.  While I was stuffed by the end of the meal, I could have kept eating the food was so good.  They did really good pairings with each course.  They usually have two wine pairing, it is worth the splurge to go for the premium pairing.  I tasted wines that I had never had before and I would be very surprised if I ever have some of those wines again.  Really good! Definitely worth going at least once!",

It was my first time, and it was a Vegan menu and I paid $550 for two people with wine pairings. So the time, the money, the limited menu all are potential downers for the event. Then came the food, then came more food, not to mention the drinks, then at some point I think 22 courses later, the food stopped coming and I somehow got home. The food was amazing and I don't want to ruin some of the surprises they bring out by describing them all on a public forum, but I will say that I did not miss the meat, and I am a bacon lover. They dont really try to fool you into thinking you are eating meat, but the savory flavors you get provide all the umami that you would expect. Do not eat anything before you get there because you will be pushing yourself to finish the 22 courses as it is. Whether you get the wine pairings or the non alcoholic pairings you won't be disappointed. Although my party got the wine pairings, our neighboring diners got the non alcoholic pairings, and I was the one who felt jealous. They have someone very smart putting together the most unique non alcoholic cocktails I've seen or heard of. If this is what they can do with Vegan I definitely want to come back and try a non restricted menu!",

Being an Asian myself and have been to Kyoto to try the real Kyoto menus, all I could say is that Chef Grant made a good try and blended in the western influence with this most traditional Japanese cuisine.  Good imagination on flavor. It, however, fails to bring out the freshness of the food, which is the true essence of Japanese cuisine, and too salty at times. Good choice on wines to pair with the food. Superb service.",
