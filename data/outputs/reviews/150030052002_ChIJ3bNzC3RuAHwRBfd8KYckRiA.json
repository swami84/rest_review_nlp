There was an assortment of options for social distancing seating during this COVID-19 situation, but you can tell that even during normal times, there would be a good layout.  The staff were all very inviting and friendly while maintaining their own safety spaces.  We were greeted immediately and offered seating options.  Hand sanitizer was also available right when you walked in the door from a no touch dispenser.  We came on a Saturday, so there was only the brunch menu available. It was a bit of a disappointment, but our fault for not checking first.  There were adequate options to choose from despite not having the full lunch menu available.  I ordered the Tavern Burger.  The burger was probably one of the best gourmet burgers I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection, they got my order of medium rare perfectly.  Everything from the bun to the accudiments were all put together for a picture perfect burger that was very delicious. The only disappointing part of this dish were the french fries. Not sure what it was, but they just were not very good. The fries were limp and didn't seem to have been cooked properly.  My partner got the lobster roll.  Although the lobster was excellent and generous, there was just something missing about this sandwich.  It needed something more to the lobster and mayonnaise and seemed incomplete.  I think if you were a minimalist for food who like thing plain, you would like this dish.  All in all, it was a good experience and would recommend others to try it.",

The fried pork belly and asparagus were great accents.  The old fashion was recommended by the waitresss an didn't disappoint. The bitters were the perfect accompaniment to the bourbon. Although the menu stated that the bourbon was Livestock selected Maker's Mark...it was actually Elijah Craig? It was even printed as Makers on my receipt...Either way, well executed besides the confusion on what's inside.  We selected the leg of lamb as our main. The lamb was sliced thin and seared. This led to the meat being overdone and jerky like. I think it would been executed better as a roast ad cut to order. Some of the vegetables were underdone. Overall a promising dish that underwhelmed.  One strang side note, the bathroom soap was way overpowering, interfering with the taste of my drink and meal.  I would've liked to share these issues with the staff, but I wasn't asked how my meal went.  Overall, I would be hesitant to recommend this restaurant...as the issues I experienced seem to be apart of the normal operation. It is the little things that matter when paying chef quality prices...",

Atmosphere was bustling and cozy and typical of the funky restaurants dotted around Honolulu\u2019s Chinatown. Shared the kale salad to start and it was massive and delicious coming on a bed of seasoned whipped ricotta. Had the Manhattan crab stew for my main and it was chock full of amazing seafood. My partner had the pork chop and loved it. Also a generous portion. And the fries are hand cut - sounds simple but not easily found in Honolulu! Unfortunately they were out of dessert, would\u2019ve loved to see what that was like, from the pics it looked scrumptious.",

What was the most surprising, IN ALL THE BEST WAYS, was the quality of the food, the dedicated service, and the ambiance!  This place is a gold mine.  We made reservations same day without issue.  Inside has a ton of bar seating and the dining area hosts 20 or so tables.  Particular for bourbon with their bar, the drinks were delicious and the bar is stocked with a great variety.  The menu is meat based so it\u2019s not vegan \ud83c\udf31 or veggie friendly.  Think you could gather that from the name \ud83d\ude44 but they have a few salad options and a Brie sourdough appetizer that was delicious.  I ordered the roasted chicken entree and it was the best meal I\u2019ve had in a long time.  My other half ordered the prime rib, and the boy from Texas said it\u2019s one of the best he\u2019s ever had!  Highly recommend and will return again.",

There is a fine line between greasy and rich, and it can be difficult when working with marrow. I preferred the SEARED DUCK BREAST.

My husband treated us to dinner here and because it was our first time, he ordered a plethora of dishes with many of the house favorites and those recommended by the waitstaff! Can I say that we were absolutely floored!!!! In all my years of living here in Hawaii and having had the opportunity to partake of meals from different cultures and places across the island chain, I have never enjoyed the food as much as I did this evening! We started with some of their most popular appetizers to include their creative and fresh salads topped with strawberries soaked in a light vinaigrette, deep fried pork belly strewn over a bed of crisp and thinly sliced cabbage drizzled with a house dressing and their freshly baked brie topped with an amazing cherry tomato concoction to spread over house bread baked charred to perfection! But our most favorite and flavorful dish was their escargot with bone marrow..\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d...yes...my husband and I are in love with this dish! It was overflowing with an insanely rich and smooth beef flavor that complemented the escargot and mash with every bite. Once we were done with the delectable appetizers, our main entrees were served and we were floored and wowed over and over again! Each dish was a paradise of it's own flavors and there was not one that lacked luster! We tried their popular house burger, smoked prime rib, rack of lamb,  lobster pasta, and the whole fish dish, which to my son's delight was an entire red snapper, from head to tail, served on a bed of ratatouille. There was truly something for everyone and these dishes surely superceeded our expectations and definitely tantalized our tastebuds. What can I say? This is our new favorite restaurant!!!Not to mention the adorable and outgoing waitstaff who were very friendly and engaging from the moment we walked in! They made us feel comfortable from the start and their great customer service made the whole experience that much more delightful! We will be back for sure to have another round of bone marrow escargot and to try their other dishes, which the waitstaff informed us do change from time to time, with the exception of a few house favorites that remain on the menu year round! So if you are looking for a localplace that has a unique ambiance, great customer service and dishes that deliver an explosion of flavor with every bite, Livestock Tavern is an absolute must try and try again!!",

I never had to wait for anything but I was bothered by a \"buzzing\" server. It's obvious the staff work as a team taking care of all the guests so great work! We ordered the octopus and crab cakes for starters. The octopus was so tender, it was so incredible. I'm picky about octopus because it can sometimes be too chewy, not this time. It was borderline perfect. The crab cakes were also really good. For dinner, I ordered the Scallop Gnocchi which was just delicious. The presentation needs some work and I expected the Scallops to be bigger but the taste was just awesome. By the end of dinner, there was not an empty plate between the 4 of us. Highly recommend this place to anyone who loves their meat!!",

I grew up with duck, and have enjoyed it in several ways. I've grown in my palate, but also expectations. I look for duck to be a rich and savory dish. When it is prepared correctly it is hearty and delicious. Working with it's fats and texture produces an excellent dish. Unfortunately this one took a ninety degree turn. They tried, not well, to mix in candied fruit to deal with the fat. The duck itself was rather tough. The croquet, not hash, was ok. The presentation was well done, hut can't really make up for a poor dish.  I like this location and other menue items, but I cannot reccomend the Duck.",

Hipster places popping all over and gentrifying a otherwise undesirable location.   I suppose you can call the area gritty.   However, it was a convenient straight shot 25-min bus ride from our hotel in Waikiki.  A local took us here and introduced us to Livestock Tavern -- I would definitely visit again.  We had the octopus appetizer. I generally don't eat straight up squid of octopus unless it's in takoyaki or fried to a crisp in calamari so having grilled octopus was interesting.  The texture was very soft which I hear is hard to achieve with octopus.  For the main course, I had the braised short ribs which were off the charts tender and flavorful.  It's a definite reorder the next time I visit.  Lastly, we had the chocolate mousse cake which was simply divine.  Service was wonderful.",
