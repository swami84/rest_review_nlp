Secondly, the food was amazing. We were here to celebrate my birthday and my mother (who does not like pasta) loved the experience & food. She was still talking about it today! We practically ordered the whole menu & shared everything and I can't say there was something I didn't like. It's also very hard to pick a favorite! I will add that every person we had an interaction with was very nice & the staff in general takes Covid seriously.

We love Daisies and would love for them to not just survive but thrive! Today we discovered that you cannot use a Daisies gift card when placing an order at Daisies on Tock! No problem, just call them up and place your order over the phone, right? Nope..... you can't do that. You can only place an order for them on Tock! For those who would still like to use your gift card for a pick up order, here is how you have to do it. Call them up..... Explain what you want to the person who works there, at the restaurant, who can't take your order!  Read them the 16 digit number from your gift card to them over the phone. They will write it down or type it into their system (the note pad or system they used to use when they could take your order over the phone). Then go on line and place your order on Tock! They have promised me that when my order comes up on their system, the one they used to be able to take your order over the phone on, they will apply your gift card. Would somebody please explain to me how, why this is better? At least, I assume Tock is paying Daisies for complicating on line order taking, forcing Daisies from taking orders over the phone, and irritating their customers, right? (Fat chance!)  Second question. (Rhetorical),  Now that I have used Tock once, because I had no other option if I wanted to order from Daisies, how do I get Tock to stop bombarding me with junk email!?  Third Question. define Kafkaesque?",

Turns out...this place has amazing, home made food and quality service in a very relaxing and chill environment. They also have a small take out menu for fresh products. It's pretty brilliant, really. It allows the chef to continuously have fresh items without as much waste. The hostess was sweet...told us there weren't any tables outside, but she had the (open air) window table available. Since we can get kind of loud, it was a perfect locationfor us... out of the way with a cool breeze and a view. Our server Nicole made the experience for us though. She was friendly, witty, professional, funny and had a playful nature. She chose our food for us and we couldn't have been happier. The cocktails were thoughtfully prepared and not pretentious. The pastas were incredible and the desserts were just what they needed to be. I truly cant wait to go back. Thank you Nicole \ud83d\udc9b",

We had a couple different cocktails, one of which was a gin based herbal and earthy drink that was really good. The overpriced tomato appetizer was in fact, overpriced for the portions served, but was good. We also had their trout special and a couple pasta dishes. I had a vegetarian pasta dish with the gluten free pasta and it ended up being $24 for what was a very small portion, yet still very good. Considering the simplicity and portion sizes of the dishes, the prices are too high. I do applaud them for having a lot of gluten free options, but the $5 upcharge for gluten free pasta seems high to me.",

I don't just go around complaining.  This place takes advantage of its customers once they are in the door. Online it says entrees are 15-25 dollars. Our waitress suggested that we order 2 appetizers and 5 entrees between two of us!  The definition of 'entree' is \"the main course of the meal\". Suggesting that two regular people need 5 main courses between them means that this place is gaming the system and redefining words to suit their needs to get people in the door.  I feel bad for the couple on their first date who were next to us, ordered drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees, and we heard comment that it looked like they still needed to go elsewhere for the rest of their dinner.  The food was really good, and if their menu said \"small bites\" or something along those lines instead of the grossly misleading \"entrees\" I would have given 5 stars. It's really predatory to get people in the door and then explain the liberties you have taken with the English language. People with friends or on first dates are now embarrassed to not want to spend 2.5x what they would at a restaurant that is not misleading them, so they stay. Solid business plan.",

All the pasta dishes were good, but not great and at that price point you expect great. Also the portions were exceedingly small and not meant to fill up even a small person like myself. There aren\u2019t any sides to choose from....no bread or salad or vegetable options and they need to seriously revamp their appetizer selection.

The drink menu was very reasonably priced with an excellent wine list. The food was amazing. I had the tortellini and found it very well balanced. The GM walked around and intermingled with guests which stood out to me in a good way.  I think the only negative experience, outside of the environment, was the unprofessional staff. Not in a sense that they didn\u2019t care about what they were doing, but everyone we came in contact with at our table definitely seemed as if it was their first or maybe second job in the service industry. One particular instance was when a waiter spilled a plate of our order onto the table next to us. I asked for a certain flavor profile of wine in one instance, and our waiter seemed kind of puzzled and unsure of his response. I do not know if it\u2019s unfair of me to say this, but I expected a more experienced staff.  I will definitely come back for a glass of wine and a fantastic pasta dish, hopefully next time the staff is more prepared.",

We did the \"Feed Me\" option which included eight pre-selected dishes -- two appetizers, five pastas, and a dessert -- each of which was distinctive and delicious. My personal favorite was the Manti with butternut squash and smoked onion, though I would order any/all of the pasta offerings again in a heartbeat. What's more, they were very attentive to the fact that my husband is a pescatarian and were very mindful about making vegetarian substitutions, when able, and serving the bacon component of several pasta dishes on the side. All in all, I can't say enough good things about Daisies and will certainly be back!",

The waitress was a bit snippy but it was pretty loud in there so that may have come off that way unintentionally. We ordered pasta for each of us. Pasta was good and fresh. I would come again but wasn't blown away. The apple herb salad we ordered for the table was fresh and crisp but no salad dressing to speak of so it was like eating an apple with herbs cut from the garden. It was supposed to have dressing so they ended up taking it back and not charging us. It was nice the manager didn't try and argue they just accommodated. We'd return to give it another shot.",

My companion and I ended up ordering 3 plates of pasta because it was so delicious. The portion sizes are on the smaller side, it's not a heaping mound of mushy garbage like you get at Olive Garden. Definitely going back soon! Please go and enjoy these pasta masters, you won't be disappointed.",

For main courses, you cannot go wrong. Seriously. I've had everything and not a single disappointment, but some highlights include: Tagliatelle (yes, add black truffle if you can), Agnolotti (such an interesting and delicious mix with beets), and the fish (eat the skin, I know that may sound weird, but the way it's prepared makes the skin arguably the most flavorful part).  Overall, highly recommend you try before this place starts to circulate and books up. Cheers!",
