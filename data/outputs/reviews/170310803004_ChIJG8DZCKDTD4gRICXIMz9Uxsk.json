I have lived in ny and love that style pizza and from the moment I tried the first slice I was hooked. This in my opinion is the best thin crust in the city. Whenever I have cheat day I\u2019m ordering from Bobs, which is almost weekly. I have been doing all I can to get this place on Barstools radar but part of me wants to keep this place a secret because I know Prez will love this Pilsen style pizza. Its a little thicker than true ny but thats ok, the crisp on the crust is fantastic. You can see the pizza bubbles, as true pizza people know thats an indicator of good pizza. The ingredients taste fresh and the sauce is tasty. At some point I would love to come in and meet the people who make the pie because they are doing great work. Thank you!",

Then one day, walking on that side of the street I took a look at their menu and knew we had to order from here because his style, somehow it reminded me of Italy! So we kept forgetting to get their pizza till last night. We got the Spinach Pesto & Stracciatella Pizza and added banana peppers and classic sausage with onions. Thin and not so thin, crispy and delicious! Both, the bomb!! Now don\u2019t forget to get the oatmeal cream pie, simple and rich but not too sweet.  To the owner, I love the quality of your pizza and the ingredients you use. You have made me want to eat pizza again, I am gluten sensitive and this pizza did not bother me, ingredients are so good.",
