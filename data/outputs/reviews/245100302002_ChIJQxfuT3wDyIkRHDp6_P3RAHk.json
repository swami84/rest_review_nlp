We literally heard the patrons say \u201cwe\u2019re leaving because the service is slow\u201d. It was not busy and we were trying to figure out what was making him slow.

Our server was running from table to table trying to keep up with everyone's needs and wants but it was nearly impossible.  We waited 45mins for our salad, honey old bay wings, and tomato soup that was served lukewarm. After being served our appetizers we waited another 45-50 mins for our main entree.

        "caption": "Very nice restaurant. We found this restaurant on Google maps searching for restaurants in Baltimore. It turns out the restaurant is inside of a Marriott hotel. First off the parking situation, there is limited parking on the street but plenty of parking garages. I decided to park in the Marriott parking garage, every spot said either reserved valet or reserved so I thought I couldn't park there  I was in the garage for less than 5 minutes and decided to find somewhere else to park I put my ticket in to exit and it said $15. I was shocked as I was in there for 5 minutes it less. I pushed the call button and talked to the parking garage customer service and they said, \"pay no attention to the signs you can park wherever you like but just remember to take your ticket with you to validate it before you get back to your vehicle. After I left the garage I talked to a Marriott employee and they verified what the parking person said. That was very confusing. Now about the restaurant.  What's unique about this restaurant is that it's a restaurant inside of a restaurant. I had difficulty finding it. You go through the hotel lobby and then you make a left onto a restaurant called illy, and then this restaurant is within it. Never experienced anything like that before.  The food was decent. I want to fond of the appetizer I had. It was the crabcake and it tasted like it came out of the Frozen section of a supermarket. Very mushy. My date ordered the Brazed Chesapeake Bay Mussels, I tasted some of it and I highly recommend that appetizer.  The entrees were great. I had the rib and my date had the salmon. They were excellent.",

It came with roasted eggplant, caramelized onion, and tomato coulis, and it was TO DIE FOR good.  Who the hell knew cauliflower could be so tasty?  The texture was perfection \u2013 just the right amount of chewy \u2013 and the filling was yumtastic.  Definitely make sure to get an order of their Butter Chicken as well!",

We weren't impressed with the few options on the menu so we decided to just get a soup and an entree to share.  We tried the cream of crab soup, (and I know my cream of crab soup) and the flavor was good, not great, but I did not find a single morsel of crab meat in the luke warm soup.  The entree we ordered was a sweet potato ravioli over peppers and other roasted veggies.  The peppers were good, the ravioli was boring.   Overall, I would maybe try this place again IF I walked in and checked to make sure their menu had better options this time.   Otherwise, I would walk to any of the really good places nearby.",

I am on Keto during this visit so was happy to find cauliflower pizza crust on the menu.  Even if you are not on Keto this crust is worth a try, it is similar to a thin crust pizza.  The cauliflower taste is minimal, I really only only noticed when I ate the crust by itself.  The wings here are also good, with a great flavor and seasoning.  For those folks on Keto this one is not for you as they are breaded.  Lastly, for those into moonshine ask to have the house drink, not sure if it is on the menu all time but it is worth asking about.  The drink is made in house including the booze and honey.  The menu does change seasonally and depending on items availability so if you are looking for a particular item be sure to check ahead if they have it.  The service would be the only area for improvement as they can be a bit slow depending on what is happening in the hotel, but if you were to let them know you are in a hurry I am sure they will accommodate.  The photo in this review is of the three different pizzas, I shared with some other folks.  The crab was by far my favorite but all were great.",

I could not possibly list all the great items I had so I will just hit the highlights - The Mussels in Beer and hushpuppies with jalepenos were both great starters, each presented beautifully. The shrimp and grits may be their best dish but I also loved their short rib. Dessert, from the cheesecake to chocolate cake were to die for. The service both times was just superb, very friendly and helpful. Apropoe's is a good place for a drink with friends or a four course dinner. The only drawback is that it is in Harbor East and all that entails (traffic and parking), but you can get $8 valet parking for three hours with dinner at Apropoe's. This is fairly new to the restaurant scene in Baltimore and a great addition.  Pro Tip: Try some of their Poe themed cocktails,they are DIVINE.",
