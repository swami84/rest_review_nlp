Ordered palak paneer, rotis and veg uttapam. The restaurant is not open for dine-in due to COVID but they delivered order within 30 mins. The palak paneer was just like how I make it at home. Unlike other restaurants, this place had not used any cream in it. The ingredients used were very fresh and I could taste caramelized onions, fresh garlic and ginger in the palak paneer. The mix veg uttapam was also delicious. Rotis were soft and freshly prepared. I highly recommend this place if you are in mood for indian food.",

With a group of five friends, every Friday during COVID, we have ordered out from various, highly rated restaurants in the DC area, to get a true sense of DC food. Many of those highly-rated, nodded-at restaurants provided less that expected food and service. This is not the case for VEGZ. Service was polite, professional, and knowledgeable, even after my multiple calls to clarify menu items to determine the best serving size for our group of six, hearty eaters. Online ordering was simple, and pick-up was effortless. Food was packed clearly, and easy to portion out. The quality of food, simply stating, was amazing! We were left talking about the meal for days afterwards - whereas many highly-acclaimed (Michelin and WaPo) restaurants barely left us talking about the food hours after the meal. And, since this is a review, as a meat lover, I never felt as though something was missing.  I am passing on the word about this gem! Thank you, VEGZ, for the beautiful meal and contributing to diversity of dining in our city.",
