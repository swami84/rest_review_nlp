I called to find out what's taking so long the guy said oh yea we are backed sorry It's just now being made. Seriously an hour after I ordered and it's just now being made. And then he goes on to say yes it's a 2 hour wait. I said well that's not what I was told when I ordered he said well that's what it is.

HOWEVER, when I called the store to complain about everything, Noah the manager made everything alright! He apologized profusely and said that he could get me a New CORRECTLY MADE pizza out to me in 30 minutes. I am very pleased with his customer service and involvement! So I bumped it to 3 stars from 2. Thank you Noah.  So the last 3 times my wife and I have ordered from this location (it\u2019s the closest to our house) they have quoted a certain time and it hasn\u2019t been CLOSE to the delivery time window. This 3rd time we were 26-36 minutes. We have now been waiting 45 minutes and when I finally got in touch with the store, the girl that answered the phone said it was still going to be another 10 minutes. I guess nobody understands time here. When I told the girl the time we were told, she responded with \u201cokay (silent pause) sorry\u201d then said \u201cit\u2019s still going to be 10 minutes until it gets there\u201d then hung up. Pretty positive we won\u2019t be ordering from them again. The 2 stars is because this location IN THE PAST has given decent service.",

        "caption": "SAVE YOUR MONEY! HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!  Your storefront #601, located at 320  E. Cervantes  Street in Pensacola,  FL is horrible. No other way to put it.  Today, I placed an advance order and selected online, to have my order ready at 12noon. This was for a meeting here at my office, The Pensacola News Journal. There was no option to place order to be ready at 11:45am, so I immediately called the store, spoke to Noah, and he confirmed that he changed my order to be ready at 11:45am pick up.  I arrived at the store at 11:40am and paid for my order, $38.72. Another employee, who rang me up, said it would be a few minutes. After sitting for 12 minutes, at 11:52am,  I asked why my four pizzas were not out yet. Noah said they were coming right out. A few minutes earlier, a male employee went into the restroom (located right at the front door, which is strange unto itself).  Less than 2 minutes later, a customer named Linda arrived to pick up her order (which was 3 pizzas) and Noah and the other young man then had a conversation and informed me that my order was never even placed into the oven yet. WHAT? Noah, who confirmed with me on the phone that my order would be ready at 11:45am, now a few minutes before noon is telling me that my order was never made.  The man who walked into the restroom near the front door, I found out was the manager and named Cory. Poor customer Linda, who wanted to pay to pick up her pizzas, could not pay because only Cory had the keys to process the payment. Cory, who had been in the restroom a total of 21 minutes, FINALLY came out almost 10 after noon. One minute prior to that, I called Dominos Pizza from your counter at Papa Johns, placed the same order with them on the phone with a promise my pizzas would be ready in 10-15 minutes. WOW!  Cory never acknowledged your customer Linda, took her credit card and swiped it, placed the receipt in front of her and walked 6 steps to the area right outside of the office. He then came back up, while I was on the phone with  Domino's, turned a key in the register and processed a refund of receipt. Noah asked me to sign it, as Cory (no name tag and very bad attitude) walked back to the same location less than 6 feet away from me.  I would have expected an apology or even an acknowledgement that their beyond horrible customer service is not what they should be delivering, especially that they are a new location. I asked the other employee (didn't get his name) what the manager's name was and said that I would have expected an apology and that not even speaking to me, while he stands nearby listening to me, is unacceptable. I informed them that I would be contacting the corporate office and the manager Cory just sneared at me.  Let me personally say, I will never step foot into another Papa John's. Not only have I informed my co-workers of this inexcusable behavior and horrendous treatment, I intend to share my experience throughout review sites. Cory should not be managing anything. As an Advertising Sales Manager for the past 28 years, customers are number one. They are obviously NOT number one at this store in Pensacola and my entire network of friends will know of this experience.  Stay away from this Papa John's.",
