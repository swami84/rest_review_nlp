The menu changes with the ingredients in season, so every time I go I always find something new to eat. However, I do wish some dishes would be permanent as they are too delicious to only have once! On tus occasion we had the asparagus which were cooked to perfection, the shrooms with eggs and the Reuben bikini as appetizers. We then had the rice with mushrooms which was exquisite. It\u2019s always a pleasure to dine here. Ernesto\u2019s is a neighborhood favorite.",

Their outdoor dining keeps in mind the safety of all patrons and staff by asking everyone to wear a mask when not eating. Unlike recent reviews on this page, the staff asking me to do this made me feel safe. Anyone who is complaining about COVID 19 protocols is just being selfish. Thank you to Ernesto\u2019s and I will be back very soon!!",

Its a shame to treat customers the way they did, especially when people are trying to help support small business by showing up and accepting any accommodations (in this case, outdoors with no heaters when it was freezing). we were  told over the phone that the outdoors was comfortable.  We were screamed at by the owner while we were eating to stop eating and put our masks on when a waiter was at our table, repeatedly. They used their owner power on us in an abusive way and requested these rules from no one else but us. Its unfortunate because the food was good.

Despite this, and the main reason why I am giving 1 star is because the owners were extremely aggressive and rude. I completely understand these are tough times and it is important for all restaurant customers to be respectful of the rules and help protect the staff as well but the aggressive tone and constant interruption from the owners made the experience unbearable (especially sitting outside in the cold with 1 heater for a table of 10 that barely worked..which we were fine with and didn't complain about because it is tough times...). When you have a tapas style restaurant and a large group of people eating and drinking and wait staff coming and going constantly it is very difficult to take on and off a mask in time all the time. I recommend being clear about this rule from the beginning as most restaurants do not have it (we did not hear about it till being yelled at by one of the owners) while also coming up with a smarter system where the waiters wait a few seconds away from the table until everyone has their masks on + also doing fewer \"runs\" to the table itself - it is very difficult to stop eating/drinking/conversing every few minutes especially in a large group.  Finally - one of the owners calling one of the people in our group an \"awful person\" and continuing to argue is also not professional - this is NYC sometimes you are going to get people that speak their minds in a way that you might not like but as a business owner you just can't react like that and cross the line of name calling a customer.",

Completely disrespectful, abusive behavior and repeated hurtful harassment. We were basically not allowed to remove our masks at any point in time, not matter if our food was there or not. As long as a waiter was in the area of our table, even further away than 6 feet from us, we had to stop eating to wear our masks and had to endure one of the two owners interrupting us to ask us to mask up because a waiter was not far way. They put us outdoors with no heaters even though I had previously called to understand how the outside was set up to help me and my party plan how many  layers we would wear. Their response to my question on the phone was that they were well equipped with heaters, had a full night last night and full tonight so that should be good enough for us to believe their outdoors is well setup. Anyway, all in all terrible experience. Shame. Big big shame.  Also. Please see se responses to my IG complaint's response by one of the owners below.  Shame.",

The mushroom salad was over salted, unpleasantly dresses lettuce with a couple of mushrooms underneath it. The addition of chocolate to basque style cheese cake was unnecessary, the croquetas were bland and oddly hollow. But the service was great, so if you live in the area and think $19 for a glass of nice Chardonnay is reasonable (the txakoli tasted like it had been open for at least a week) it\u2019s a nice place to drink and have the occasional nibble.

I would say that Ernesto\u2019s is definitely the best Spanish restaurant so far in NYC, along with the improved food quality in Mercado Little Spain. The price is definitely at the higher end, so please keep that in mind if you decide to go.  What I like: 1. croquetas (you know it\u2019s gonna be good when the bechamel inside is moist and oozy, the outside is crunchy and crispy) 2. tortilla de patatas!!!! (This one is a must. The best tortilla so far in nyc I\u2019ve ever had. The inside is oozing out when you cut it. Hella good. Gotta give this 12/10) 3. Callos madrile\u00f1os (no explanation needed) 4. Milhojas (riqu\u00edsimo!!!) 5. Pork collar (ib\u00e9rico pork, no need to explain) 6. Gildas (this one is good, but needs more olive oil 7/10) 7. Patatas con paleta de jam\u00f3n (chips are crispy, reminds me of Spanish aperitivo)  What I don\u2019t like: 1. Txistorra - outer needs to be CHARRED more, por favor 2. Ensalada de tomate - Where is the salt? Where is the olive oil??? 3. Escabeche - we were expecting the classic escabeche (like the one prepared with perdiz)  We didn\u2019t order pan con tomate but gotta say that it looks good. Service was ok, could be better and more efficient. We definitely did not appreciate the 20% gratuity added to our bill.",

Hostess told us 15 min into waiting that our \u201ctable was midway through dessert\u201d. Cool. Eventually was offered a seat at the bar and got moved to a table. Didn\u2019t really get an apology for making us wait for our table for well beyond our reservation time. Many others were also waiting because of the same issue. So many staff back and forth that it was unclear who our server was. Left us sitting with dirty side plates when our main came and we had to ask for new ones. Wanted dessert, but after waiting 5-10 min for them to clear our plates and 5-10 min for someone to offer us a dessert menu, decided to leave instead. Not sure if they\u2019re overwhelmed by the hype as a result of recent Bon Appetit features, but the front of house has some kinks to work out.  For the price we paid (and as tourists with the dollar being higher here), we really expected better.",

A short walk from Chinatown or the East Village, the decor is modern yet inviting, and the food is delicious. Portion sizes aren't too big, but that just means you can order plenty and taste a lot. We got the uni tortilla, mushroom and egg, shrimp toast, octopus skewers, iberico and chips, rabbit stew, razor clams with rice - plus dessert: all for 2 people. It was a decent amount of food, but again, the portions aren't too big. The real winner was cocktail: try the Hell in a Hand Basque-ette for a drink that tastes like a delicious health shot. Book it on Resy, because the restaurant fills up fast.  I noticed next door there is an Ernesto's Cafe: didn't see anyone inside but it could perhaps be a good option if the restaurant is all booked out.",

Yes, people come for the ham tower, but there were plenty of delicious seafood options for nom-pork eaters - and my vegetarian companion left full and happy! The wine pairing was perfect. The staff incredibly friendly and it had a great atmosphere. Honestly, if you can't get dinner, impress your date and come for wine and dessert.",

The torrijas for dessert was also incredible - perfectly crispy exterior and super fluffy interior. The wine selection was also fun and diverse, with bottle prices starting around $60 and individual glasses ranging $14-21. Beyond the food, we were both blown away by the service - usually brand new restaurant (especially for first-time restauranteurs) can be spotty while the team figures things out, but the whole crew was super friendly, super attentive, and super knowledgeable of the whole menu. The price can creep up pretty fast so watch how much you order. We'll definitely be back!",

The food is way overpriced versus its quality. Unfortunately my Tortilla de trufa had an eggshell in it (not a dealbreaker for me). A lot of the food was lukewarm meaning it sat for a while before the staff could serve it. Their cocktails were great. Wine had nyc prices and a ca\u00f1a was 8 dollars which in Spain would be 2 Euros. If you are Spanish you could never justify the prices but if you are living in new york and looking for a good atmosphere maybe its worth checking out.",
