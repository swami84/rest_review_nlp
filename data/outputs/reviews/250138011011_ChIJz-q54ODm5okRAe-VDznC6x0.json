The BLT comes with spinach pesto. And while the Pork Bahn Mi really isn't quite really one, it is tasty as all get out. Wine by the glass was excellent value.",

Peanut butter and jelly bar and the caramel bar. Both were awesome. The caramel bar is half the size of the other but for good reason, it is so rich that if you had a whole one I think you'd get sick. Super yummy! I was surprised to find this here to be honest.

This is not just any black bean burger. It is THE black bean burger of all bean burgers. It comes with onions, cheddar, avocado, mango, spinach, chipotle, on a focaccia bread. All of which were fresh. The mango was a different touch but it works and the flavors married together well. It was served with a side of thinly sliced cucumbers that appear to be in some sort of brine.  There was a bit of a wait for my order because it was lunch time rush, but well worth the wait!  I will definitely be going back to get this and to try their other selections.  Unfortunately there is no photo to accompany this review. I was hungry and had to nurse my baby. Next time!",

The staff was very curteous and made sure we felt welcomed, small Cafe but cozy and clean. I highly recommend this place they are located in the center of downtown Springfield in the market place near Mass Mutual Center. They're hours are Tuesday thru Saturday from 11-3pm. You will not leave disappointed another thing to note is they have something for everybody vegan and non vegan.",

The slaw was great.  I LOVED the coconut Masala veggie soup as well.  If they were open later I would have gone back end of day to bring home a quart of the soup for dinner tonight.  Will lunch there  again soon.",
