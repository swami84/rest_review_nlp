I feel that was dodgy to make you spend more. Second, those tables are not big enough to serve food for more than 2 people on, too squeezed. Third, The orders are not sequenced. Imagine being brought your starter, mains and dessert all at a go? I don\u2019t understand what training goes on for the staff to see that you can\u2019t serve all ordered food at once...it\u2019s only logic. Overall, quite underwhelming for a Michelin holder, honestly.",

Food-wise, the vegetable dishes steal the show. When it was possible, I loved coming with a group and ordering all of them for the table. Every experience I\u2019ve had here has been phenomenal to the last detail - and affordable! This is where I\u2019d bring someone I really liked on a date or for a special, intimate night out.",

They need to purchase patio heaters to put between tables so the customers feel warm during cold weather. Also, the contactless payment system took me awhile to figure out.  Overall this is one of the best restaurants in DC and I urge everyone to try this place!!!!",

We shared the eggplant (this was my favorite), the bamya and the shore-nakhot. All was delicious! The next day I decided to go back to have lunch with another friend. We sat at the terrace which was super nice and calm on a weekday. This time we shared the lentils with palow rice, the classic beef dumplings and a delicious dessert called firne\u00e9. Everything was amazing again! I also tried the chai latte and it was really good. The service was nice and patient. So I really recommend this place if you are in DC and are willing to try new flavors!",

We had ordered 3 orders of Mantoo Shrimp (6 dumplings in 1 order). On receiving the bag from the server, I chanced upon checking whats inside and there was only 1 order of Mantoo Shrimp. In fact the slip stapled on the bag also said it was 1 order of Mantoo Shrimp. Raising the issue to the same server, she did not care to apologize even once and said this happened because they are short staffed. I mean a delay in your service is understandable but how can you give 2 orders less if you are short staffed. To make things worse, one of the orders had 5 dumplings, instead of 6 as mentioned in the menu.  I am still a fan of their food and quality, but this experience at Lapis would remain a question on their service and credibility.",

My 1 start is because I went out of my way to place an order from their website (so they didn\u2019t pay for Grubhub fees), tipped generously even tho it was a pickup and paid from their website.  When I got home I realized they didn\u2019t include one of the dishes. When I called the manager I pulled the receipt and saw they charged me $12 extra to help employees during Covid. Valid.  I don\u2019t have a problem giving. I probably would have given more if given the option. What I don\u2019t appreciate is the sneaky way they did that. It didn\u2019t feel right. At no point during checkout they mentioned adding this to the bill. When MentionEd it to the manager she said.. yes i know.. it\u2019s true sorry. But didn\u2019t offer to remedy it in any way.  overall don\u2019t like their ethics. There are plenty of places with ok food that won\u2019t take advantage of people out there. Shame on you guys.",

We ordered qabuli palow, which was very similar to Uzbek plov. The lamb was amazing, slow cooked and tender, falling apart with just the touch of a fork. The dish is filling, and they give you a lot of it, it's amazing. We had the chopawn (shepherd lamb chops) which were AMAZING; dusted with sumac, salty and charred on the outside, tender and pink in the middle. This is my new favorite restaurant.",

There was a long wait for tables and we didn\u2019t make a reservation, but we sat at the bar right away, which was great. It is dimly lit with warm lights and candles, so it\u2019s very cozy and intimate. The dishes are very affordable and well portioned. I can\u2019t recommend this place enough!

This place is the first time I've never experienced Afghan food so I cannot tell if this is the authentic experience but I've gone back for the second time and liked the flavors.  They have great meat dishes as well as vegetarian options. The atmosphere is warm and staff is friendly even though I find the inside at night to be rather dark because I personally prefer well-lit spaces.  It's a little bit hard to reach through metro but it's gonna be worth it to pay a visit. They also have outdoor seating during better weather. The way to plan a date would be to visit the zoo and then walk across the bridge to get to this restaurant for dinner. And good for first dates with likely-vegetarians.",

I definetely recommend trying the Afghan dumplings and the lamb korma with a side of palaw. Staff was friendly and polite. There is a very cozy and large bar downstairs to wait for your table to be ready. Long cocktail menu at the bar, worth trying. If i had to criticize one thing, it would be that the cardamom dominance on the menu may be a tad too much. I do love cardamom but after a few dishes and the desert, my taste buds became immune to it. But this detail isn\u2019t enough to take a star down from Lapis, so i give 5 stars.",

Would recommend getting multiple dishes to share (to try a bunch of them) or pick a single dish and guard it selfishly while still trying everyone else's food. These are smaller, more shareable plates, so don't expect the overly large portions here which is a great for trying a bunch of different items.  Definitely get any or all of the house-made sodas and we definitely recommend saving room for desert (a combination/sharing of the Halwa and the Maghoot was a delightful combination - we couldn't pick a favorite!).  Minus 0.5 star for the sound. It was definitely very busy in there, but you could still hear music blaring over the overbearing sound of conversation in the dining room. People really had to yell to speak to the person across the table from them and I felt bad for our host and waiter for having to yell and describe something to us or hear what we were asking. I hope this place can find a way to maybe add some fabrics to the walls or sound-dampening materials around the ceiling to help. For anyone who is sensitive to sound, definitely go during a non-busy time - the food is too amazing to miss out on.",

In any case, I got promptly seated by a window once someone noticed me, and I was given a menu and water. I ordered the aushak with beef, and it came out soon after. I've never had Afghan food before, so this was my first time eating a dish like it. I've had dumplings from other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe, but never like these! Inside the dumplings were some sort of green vegetable (lettuce?) and the skin was chewy, and on top of it all was beef. The beef was flavorful but a bit salty, though the yogurt balanced out the salt. The yogurt was really sour actually and quite thick, yet it paired well with the dumplings and meat. All in all a very satisfying dish. There were 6 dumplings on my plate, and the dish was $13.20 post-tax which is a bit pricey. Service was good, the ambiance was relaxed and pleasant, and the waitress was really friendly. I would come here again to try their other dishes!",

Finally made it this trip to DC- didn't dissapoint and only made me want more! Did the tasting menu- perfect amount of food for 2 people and we are big eaters. Shrimp dumplings were swimming in this incredible saffron creme sauce. The yogurt dip was zesty and fresh.  All very powerful and complex flavors layered into exquisit food. My only problem is that my stomach wasn't big enough and we wanted to try EVERYTHING! We were sat right near the kitchen and every time a plate came out we were turning our heads wondering what that amazing looking dish tasted like- we suffered from a serious case of food envy. The three stews we had were also rich and hearty- chicken was slightly overdone but it didnt matter because we mopped up the juice with some warm naan.  Low lighting so photos weren't coming out great. Decor is very original and the story behind this restaurant is inspiring. I have no other afghan food to compare this to but the bar has been set pretty high. Will be googling some recipes when I get home.  You need to eat here.",

I came here on a Saturday night around 8:30PM before hitting the Improv Club; the spot was busy as ever but not so crowded that it was unmanageable. I sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks, while making conversation with the ever-outgoing bartender. Great service, great drinks.  My friend and I then moved to the downstairs dining area (this is the place to be). An Afghan bistro that truly ties in years of authentic recipes, the restaurant eschews a culturally intimate atmosphere.  Here it's much easier to have a soft-spoken conversation while taking in the pleasantly decorated basement.  The cocktails, as mentioned, are fantastic. The food however is even better. The meats are cooked super tender and the qormas are bursting with flavor. You can tell that everything is prepared fresh; the home-cooked feel is simply intoxicating.  I Liked: Chicken Qorma - A traditional Afghani dish (also very popular in India & Pakistan), Qorma is best served with rice (order rice separately). The chicken in the dish is cooked so tender that it simply melts in your mouth and the flavors of the curry are pungent without being overbearing. 5/5  Rice w/ Carrots and Raisins - A sweeter rice that pairs well with the chicken qorma. I enjoyed the pickled carrots and raisins. 5/5  Afghan Mule - It's a regular moscow mule (not sure about the Afghan prefix) but it tastes great and presentation is perfect. The ginger beer is made in-house, a nice touch that really makes this drink refreshing. 5/5  Summer Shandy - A drink that doesn't take itself too seriously and reminds me of summertime lemonade. 5/5  I Disliked: Nothing!",

        "caption": "Seated at a table for 2, it was very cramped, almost shoulder to shoulder with other customers.  Service was okay, sometimes condescending, but got the job done.  I've never eaten Afghani food, but it was sort of a plain style of Indian-Pakistani food, taste was good, but I left craving bolder flavors.  The one exception was a garbanzo cilantro mint cold stew or salad thing that was incredible.  Also rice options were fantastic, seems odd to have about rice, but these are worth the praise, sort of a mix between a biryani and a pilaf.  I'll probably go back, but not rushing to get there.  Almost forgot, their cocktails were fantastic!  Looked like a decent beer and wine selection too.  You won't be disappointed, just not thrilled.",
