It is a traditional Greek restaurant and the food is excellent. Pita, hummus, gyros, you name it they got it. We chose their iconic Falafel which they have mastered. From appetizers to full dinners, there\u2019s a variety of things you can get to here satisfy your hunger.  It is also a counter-serve chain restaurant, so you get your food fast and because of the open seating can chose where you\u2019d like to eat. There\u2019s plenty of seating and the option to take your meal to go as well.",
