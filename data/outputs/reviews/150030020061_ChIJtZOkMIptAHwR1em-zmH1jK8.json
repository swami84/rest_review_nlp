I have been to many massage parlors around the world, it's rare to encounter an intuitive masseuse; she has both the skill and intuition. I felt I was releasing so much stress as she focused on my tensed spots, and eased the pain. I felt lighter and better for days. My upper back and shoulders were no longer aching, the only thing I'd ache for is another massage. Getting a message from her at least once a month would make life worth living. Lots of self-care and self-love are essential. Asi communicated to me my bodily needs that I wasn't aware of and gave me great advice. I'd also like to mention that I'm pregnant in my last trimester and never thought that I could get a therapeutic massage with my big belly. Pregnant or not pregnant, this is the place to go for a highly experienced healer who masters her skills smoothly.",

        "caption": "I was a day shy of 2 weeks past my due date so I booked an induction massage with Asi. I wanted the least invasive way to help move things along. Asi was not only professional but personable and easy to talk to. She spent time listening to how I felt physically, emotionally and she answered any questions I had while thoroughly explaining her methods. She instantly made me feel relaxed and the massage was amazing! Each time she pressed the acupressure points meant to encourage labor I had contractions! I ended up having my baby that evening, who knows if it was coincidence, but either way it was an amazing experience. I wish I had been getting prenatal massages with Asi throughout my pregnancy vs last minute. While she can't make any guarantees, I believe the massage was the catalyst needed to finally relax and start labor. The atmosphere of her studio was lovely and the location was convenient especially if you're looking to grab a meal after or before. I would highly recommend body work with Asi and I hope to return during the postpartum period. Thank you Asi!",

Great studio environment (love the plants and aromatherapy) and Asi was able to squeeze me in last minute. Nice explanation of what to expect (good for first timers), overall a very relaxing experience - highly recommend :)",
