The Ethiopian special - even though they serve American food, that's all I get - comes with ample portions and they don't charge a lot. You can definitely make two meals out of the special. Compared to other Ethiopian joints, this spot gives WAAYYY more than the average..and if you've been to several, you know what average looks like. I'm attaching pics of the food (but they don't really do the spot justice) and menu since I could never find one when I was searching online. (Let me know if it helps!) Long as they are around and I'm in the area, I'll be a returning customer for life.",

For instance, you can try veterinarian dishes which include lentil that has mild sauce, potato and mild sauce, spinach or collard green, cabbage,  beets, and much more.",
