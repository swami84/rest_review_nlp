Its my second time visiting and my first time visiting since Covid and im so happy to say that everything was still the same! I had the same wonderful experience this time as i had before , last year pre-covid. Nothing was compromised. The delicious food , the attentive service, the high standard of cleanliness, the seriousness of social distancing the tables, the friendliness of the staff...I was definitely pleasantly pleased. My favorite thing about the place is that the food tastes as good as it looks. And they have a digital menu slideshow on a big screen and the food comes out looking EXACTLY as its pictured. I LOVE THAT!  No surprises . So we ordered an array of things and nothing disappointed. The Crab Cake benedict was perfection. Crunchy and creamy! The signature Eggys burger, the Nutella French toast, the stuffed french toast...ok I wont incriminate myself any longer. I feel like im confessing to my diet by typing all that i had \ud83d\ude06.

Eggy's Diner is a brunch spot located in the Loop neighborhood of Chicago. Its location is a bit hidden as it caters more to residents of the nearby apartment complexes than the daily commuters and tourist crowds.  Getting a spot here is easy given plenty of outdoor & indoor seating. I was able to get a seat immediately.  The menu consists of everything that would exist at a brunch spot. Price is $$ which is what you'd expect at a typical brunch spot. I was hard-pressed to find a unique offering that stood out to me. Luckily, I was able to settle for Gyros Skillet which seemed to be popular among other reviewers.  There's also a stocked bar with your typical brunch-spot options. I did not pay attention to the bar offerings as I was here to eat.  Service left a bit to be desired. I sat indoors and there was one waitress that covered every single table. Though not her fault, it did take a considerable amount of time for me to get service. We waited a while to get refills on coffee, water, and to get our order taken (~30m).  It wasn't a memorable experience for me and I doubt I would make it out of my way to eat here again.  3/5. Yet, for the innovative outdoor seating, I'll add an extra star and round this up to a 4/5.",

It took about 10 minutes to receive our waters but I wasn't too bothered. About 10 or 15 minutes later, someone came and took our order. About 45 minutes passed and we saw everyone else receiving their food. Our waitress came and asked if we received our food and I said no. She came back a few minutes later saying she apologized but the kitchen was \"backed up.\"   That wasn't the case considering there were multiple tables who arrived and ordered after us, by about 30 minutes, and already had their meals. Another 20 minutes went by and the waitress came back and apologized saying their was an issue with the grill for my eggs. I ordered the Eggys Benedict. Eggs Benedict are served with poached eggs so their are not cooked on a grill. She said she would comp the meal and said the food would be out in 5 to 7 minutes. About 20 minutes later, the food finally arrived. My whole meal was cold to the touch. I told the waitress who brought out the manager. The manager offered to cook my meal again and it was ready in 5 minutes. It was actually hot and the meal was okay, most likely ruined by my anger of waiting. Would have left sooner but we already waited and hour and a half so might as well eat mediocre food for free. I'm sure this is a once I a million issue, but I'm sure our order was lost and wish the waitress would have checked on us sooner to figure out what was going on.",

This may have been due to the ramp up in seated tables shortly after our arrival. The food was mostly good except the grits that a couple of us ordered. Well, it\u2019s Chicago, not Charleston. My wife had to return her breakfast as it was cold. However, mine was so hot it burnt my mouth. Strange how that happens sometimes. It took a few minutes, but hers came out fine the second time.",

It did not disappoint.  It's a big meal, in fact I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  My daughter enjoyed the Eggy breakfast burrito and my son enjoyed the kid waffles.  Our waiter David was great, making sure we had everything we needed.  We didn't feel rushed at all either, although we made sure we were ready to order when we sat down as the line of people waiting continued to grow.

Before they seated him, I explained I had been there a while, they said sorry and told me it would be a while. Inexcusable.  Responding to the manager:  FYI - I did provide may name to the hostess for the bar and was directed to wait next to other customers. I watched as the person who was sat before me pop his head in and check on the waiting time, only to tell them that was too long and leave. 10 minutes later he returned and said he would wait, so I know he was not already on the list. I realize accidents happen, but brush me off so rudely and just tell me it would be another half hour was unacceptable. Extremely poor customer service, and I will not be back.",

Just FYI for families with kids or elderly -  if you are out if towners there are elevators to bypass the stairs to get to this area where the restuarant is located.  Its surrounded by other little stores and what I assume to be apartments and a park.  Limited street parking.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Very clean, modern decor.  A chalkboard over the bar indicates bar menu, wifi password, soups of the day and more.  Nice Latino music playing had me jamming while waiting more our meals. I got Eggy\u2019s Breakfast Sandwich which consisted of - \"Fried egg, bacon, red onion jam, mixed greens, herb aioli on a bun and served with Eggy\u2019s potatoes\".  For the kiddos got the chocolate pancakes.  I also got a hot chcolate to ward off the chill of the walk over.  The food was brought out in a reasonable time.  That sandwich qss amazing, the first bite with the running yolk had me hooked.  The red onion jam really set it off as well.  Well cooked and all the food was hot and fresh.  Their pancake syrup was tasty as well.  The hot chocolate was served with what tasted like freshly made whipped cream and it was perfect.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would definitely return.  I want to try the french toast and I'm not even a french toast type of girl.",

The hubs got a Bailey's pumpkin latte and they didn't skimp on the alcohol, it was very good.

Also the eggy's breakfast sandwich superb. They don't put salt in anything and there is still so much flavor!  Our server was Gesen and he is a doll. Superb customer service  and good conversation. We felt well taken care of and will come back. Thank you to Gesen and the chefs!",

The restaurant was so loud that our waiter could barely understand what I was ordering. 4. It's very crowded inside. We were essentially sitting on the same table with the groups next to us. 5. The place is understaffed. It took ages for our waiter to come by and the staffs looked tired and overworked.  Go here early in the morning and don't try the lunch menu.

It had a down to Earth feel where you can tell they care, the people are friendly, the staff is helpful and the food it good.  They should not expand this place or more it because that would ruin this feeling!  I enjoyed the food and I enjoyed the people there.  The wait is worth it!",
