When ordering the sandwich and choosing your ingredients, make sure you list the most expensive ingredients first if you're ordering above the 4 it comes with because you'll be paying for anything after the first 4. I don't mind paying for extra toppings, but I just find it incredibly annoying that you could order the exact same sandwich with the same toppings, but end up paying different prices based on the order you list the toppings. You'd expect your waiter to do you a favor and punch in the most expensive toppings first to save you money or have the system automatically do it that way. I'm probably reading into the whole situation way too much but it really rubbed me the wrong way that this is how they treat one of their most popular menu items.",

Apparently the original owners sold and there is a noticeable difference in the food and customer service (for the worst).  2) Food - The menu used to be hand-made Austrian food and has lost it's authentic touch.  Pastries are dried out (potentially store bought) and the food used to be fresh, but has now become fast produced like a greasy diner (with more expensive prices).  3) Gift Cards - For my birthday, my parents bought me a $50 gift card because they knew I loved Cafe Vienna.  They will no longer accept gift cards, saying the new ownership changed merchant services.  Feels unethical and a likely representation for how the restaurant is now operating.",

I wasnt the biggest fan of the chorizo but it would have been perfect for winter. They also have a really good sunflower seed bread- i might go back just for that.  the ambience is nice, very like a cafe with dark wood furniture. You can be sure to meet a more international crowd here, I heard a couple of new languages as I was waiting to be served. There was a lot of space available, they do have outside seating as well, so you wont be waiting in line. I might come back to try dessert.

The \"black forrest cake\" deserved its name only because the dry cake was black and heavy, more like American devil's food in HoHos, and instead of a whipped cream filling the cream consisted of something again reminiscent of HoHos filling.

I stopped in this afternoon and got two pieces of triple chocolate cake to go for a friend and myself. Let's just say if the cake taste like everything else that's shared a displace case with, it's not a good sign. Secondly if the frosting doesn't even taste like chocolate anymore it's way past it's prime. I have worked in several bakeries part time and know you generally try to sell the older things but there's also a date check to make sure if it's not selling before that throw out date, toss it. And unfortunately it did taste like cake that's been sitting in there since the beginning of the week. I think I will be sticking with  Vanille on Broadway and Melrose from now on.",

Just this morning I was in with my parents who were visiting and we had to have been the first customers in. It took forever for our meals to arrive and people who were arriving later than us were getting their meals.  The worst part is two of the customers that arrived after us at least 20 minutes or so ordered the exact same things we had. By the time my meal had arrived (The Construction) it was sans pancakes and I had to wait another 10 minutes + for them to arrive while the customer behind me got his order and pancakes. That was definitely the most upsetting part for me. I don't know what was going on but This was the second time and I felt like an a-hole waiting an hour for my food. I complained to the staff and the most we got was an offer for a free pasty and 10% off which was like 3 dollars.  It pains me to say this because I've never had bad experiences at night there, but I don't think I'll be back.",

If I eat in the cafe, the service is usually exceptionally slow. If I order takeout, half the time they would get my order wrong (using the wrong bread, missing sides.... you name it). When I called them to complain, they were unapologetic to say the least. My worst experience was last Saturday when I got a chicken noodle soup for takeout. The soup went bad already! I had to spit out when I ate and threw the whole thing away. It was disgusting. Of course they didn't even refund me for this. Well, never again. There are so many other good bakery/brunch places in this neighborhood. I will not spend any money at this place ever again.",

The service sat us immediately and kept our water and coffee completely full. Our cups were never empty. Food came out quickly and was very delicious and warm. The food is also very cheap! Service was incredible enough we wrote a message on the receipt and bumped up the tip. Loved this place. Really want to try the rest of the crepes and the rest of the entire menu!",
