Person on the phone tells me the delivery guy had actually delivered that food a while ago. (I had asked for contactless delivery and to be texted when food is dropped off) I open my front door - nothing there. I tell the guy that I don\u2019t know where that food is delivered, but it\u2019s not here, and now I don\u2019t want it because I don\u2019t know where it has been and I don\u2019t want cold food. They tell me I\u2019m they Can\u2019t refund my money without returning the food. Obviously, this is a problem. I don\u2019t have the food so I can\u2019t return it. I ask him to have the delivery driver go to the address he delivered to and then call me and we can all get on the phone together and that should be enough to show it was delivered to the wrong Address. I have yet to hear back from them (an apology would be nice) and had to threaten to contest the charge because the manager wouldn\u2019t authorize a refund without the food returned. I understand that mistakes happen, but I\u2019m not a thief, and I am not trying to get free food. I believe I came up with a constructive way to prove it was delivered to the wrong address but was just ignored and left hungry. Also I would like to note that this restaurant uses their own delivery drivers so contacting them is Not a problem. The reason for 2 stars and not 1 is because I do believe it was an honest mistake  but again, I can\u2019t recommend a restaurant when I have received service like this.  I hope this was a one time experience and that if you do decide to order from here, you\u2019re not Subject to the same experience.",

The Naan was terrible - it was similar to the one from any supermarket. About curries, it's a bit more subtle.. out of millions of spices that would make the food tasty, the chef in this restaurant chooses to use a single one, sugar. We have read through past reviews, and decided to order curries with less sugar. We did not know at that moment it means no taste. This restaurant does not know a thing about the Indian food. Whoever thinks how bad an Indian curry can go and anyway order from here will certainly broaden their perspectives on food, by setting the lowest boundary of their  food history throughout life, at least under the Indian category.",

The baghare baigan (an eggplant dish) was slightly better, but that's not really a complement.  What flavor it did have was way off.   Honestly, it didn't even taste like Indian food.  The roti was extremely tough and hard to chew.   Oh, and the delivery was over an hour late.  The only positive thing I can say about this place was the papadum.  Again, this is my first google review in years, and I'm having trouble describing just how disappointing this food was.  I love Indian food, and I'm generally of the mind that even bad Indian food is good, but not this place.  If you're in the mood for Indian, find somwhere else.",

My wife orders the Chicken Tikka Masala and always loves it. I tend to stick with the lamb Curry's my favorite is the Lamb  Shashlik. The naan bread is always delicious slightly crispy and tender inside and for dessert I often get the Rasmalai. The prices are not cheap but the portions are large the food is fresh it is very difficult to find inexpensive quality food in New York City but it is certainly not pricey. My favorite waiter is Sumon not sure if I'm spelling it right wonderful guy always has a smile on his face.",
