Mix of snacks, small plates, larger plates with a mediterranean lean.  Staff very warm and generous with wine tasting.  Peeked inside and their big back room looks like it'll be really fun when it's ready!  Covid safety: * Everyone was masked * Took temperature on arrival *  Outdoor seating is very warm and with lots of air flow. The front of it is entirely open but there are heaters both above and in front of you. I went down to a sweatshirt on a 32 degree night.",
