The chicken lacked flavor and tasted like it had no seasoning. It\u2019s a shame because I was excited to get an online rotisserie place that delivers. Mr rotisserie failed so I\u2019ll be glad to get back to just getting takeout from Pollo Sabroso and thelikes. To make matters worse, the delivery was a little late and the driver was rude, rushing me to hurry up and come outside to get my food. But isn\u2019t the point of delivery to bring food to your door. NOT having the customer do some of the driver\u2019s work. It\u2019s a shame",

They even put A1 sauce in the bag for me (without asking) and tried to bring my food out to my car, as I was waiting in the car with my dog.  The customer service was polite and friendly. I definitely felt like my patronage was appreciated it.  I will definitely be back!  Thanks for making my day, Mister Rotisserie. Best of luck!",

The white sauce they serve on the side for the chicken is supposed to be yellow sauce that was trash. Didn\u2019t even taste close to the yellow sauce it\u2019s supposed to be. I feel like I\u2019ve been robbed for my money. This place isn\u2019t worth a penny!!! Don\u2019t waste you\u2019re money!!  P.s. I only gave them one star because that is the only way I would be able to leave a rating. They don\u2019t even deserve one star!!!!",
