We ordered French food, which we enjoyed a lot. We ended up talking to the owner, Melanie, who was absolutely wonderful. She confirmed that she is from Cameroon and told us we just needed to make sure to call ahead if we needed to her to prepare Cameroonian dishes so she can get the ingredients ahead of time. A small group of us finally got together a year later, called her to see if she had ingredients for poisson braise and piment. She didn't know if she had ingredients for baton de manioc and ndole. As soon as she said yes to the former, we power walked over to her restaurant in 40 minutes. She ended up surprising us with the ndole and baton de manioc which made all of us very happy the day after Thanksgiving. Her cooking was excellent, and you can tell she used quality ingredients in her cooking that made her food stand out. I am so excited to have this restaurant nearby!",

It's a small operation, but can definitely hold it's own among the other restaurants on 5th ave. It's definitely the most interesting food in the area right now (if you're tired of the Italian/Thai/Mexican/Sushi dinner rotation like we are).  The Chef is from Cameroon but trained in France. The food is delicious- wonderfully interesting spices, sophisticated but not pretentious. And it has the feel of a neighborhood joint in some non-nyc location (the waiter was super nice and made an effort to learn our names).  What we loved: - Grapefruit, shrimp, and arugula salad - Yassa w/chicken - Chebu Jen  If you have room for desert, try the Snow Egg.  We will definitely be going back.",

The breakfast was amazing and the dinner was the perfect portion size. The food isn\u2019t missing an ounce of flavor and the ambience is perfect to kick back and relax. The salmon is my favorite dish for dinner..it\u2019s so moist on the inside with the perfect amount of crisp on the outside, just how I like it. The waiter was one of the nicest people ever and made sure I had everything I needed. I have also had the desserts and drinks and they are also super flavorful and authentic! My favorite one was the African ginger drink..you have to try this! To say the least, I will be back here on my next trip to the city. If you are considering...you won\u2019t regret the trip!",
