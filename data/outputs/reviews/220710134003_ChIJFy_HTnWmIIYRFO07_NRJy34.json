Being vegan in new orleans is hard but city greens made it delicious and for the first time all trip I felt full (hello real protein) Plus they made my favorite cup of sweet tea all trip. All the non vegans also loved their chicken wraps and not a single wrap was leftover for the groom that night",

One time they had two people there but neither could checkout that cash register and said I needed to come back in 30 min. Today there was a line, 2 people working, only 1 was making the food and she kept pulling her phone out and texting IN FRONT OF EVERYONE! She also kept ducking to the back (I can only imagine to continue texting on her phone). Waited in line (with only 5 people ahead of me) for 30 min before I had to leave because my flight was boarding. Don\u2019t bother if you\u2019re flight boards within 30 min because you won\u2019t get your food. Such a disappointment.",

A lady with braids took my order. During the process of making my salad she had to push her hair out of her face and away from the food about 5 times. I tolerated it because she was placing the food in a bowl with utensils. However, when she got to the chicken she had to use her fingers to keep the chicken from falling out of the scooper. I tolerated that as well, but then she got to the eggs and had to use her entire gloved hands. I told her \u201cI cannot eat your salad because your hands were in your hair and then your hands were touching all over my food.\u201d She proceeded to throw the food away. I think everyone knows those handling food need to have their hair tied behind them and some managers go the extra mile and require head wraps. I am hoping something will be done about this. I could not find any contact information for the manager on-line to make a direct complaint.",

I was greeted at the door by a friendly employee,  but not offered any advice as to where to find a menu. They all just looked at me like I was an alien. Except for the cashier. She didn't want to be there. She was pretty rude. I got what looked like a promising little bowl of pasta out of a refrigerated case. It was bland, overcooked,  soggy and quite disgusting.

The ingredients we could see her putting on were fresh and real, not fake gunk.  We loved both soups! I forget the name of each one but I\u2019m picky and they were both quality ingredients and delicious. She added cheese on top if we wanted- real cheese, and offered a small side of fresh sourdough bread that was so good! The wrap was huge and really good. I went back the same afternoon for a cup of the soup to take home. The price was reasonable. There was a counter with water and cups available and lemon wedges. The water tasted filtered.

On the first attempt they delivered my order to someone else, so it was over an hour before we got our food, which were two Filet & Mango salads that did not turn out to be as good as they sounded on the menu.  On the second order we got several build-your-owns, one of which was delivered with the wrong greens and took about 45 minutes to arrive (only about 5 minutes longer than the longest of the quoted delivery time range).  So today we ordered a third time, expecting the long delivery time, and this time a salad which had been ordered with no onions and sub baby spinach for the romaine arrived full of onions and with kale instead of baby spinach (with no onions written on top of the clear container).  At least 3 of us order salads for lunch every singe weekday, looking at the menu we thought this would be a great new place in addition to Terrazu which we order from the majority of the time.  After our experiences with City Greens I believe getting a better variety is not worth the chance that we won't be getting what we ordered and we'll be getting it in an hour versus the 20-30 minutes Terrazu usually manages to deliver within.  The quality of the food is good, but it doesn't make up for the service mistakes.  Additionally, they are one of the few (if not only) restaurant we've ordered from in CBD that charges a delivery fee.",
