Wine selection was admirable. We started off with a charcuterie board basically. Not at all what i thought it was going to be. Very bare board for the price. Nothing about what was on it explained like in most established restaurants. Sadly no pic of that which was honestly the worse part about the whole experience. The other dishes in my party were close to on point. Being a retired chef myself the dishes were in my opinion chef quality, aside from the lamb that I ordered. Although the meat was juicy and cooked to temp. ( mid rare) the method of which it was prepared and presentation was a little off. More of a new style look and no sear on the meat itself. The starch pairing ( sweet potato puree I would guess ) was tasty but not to my expectations for a lamb pairing. The mint/chime churri mixture was a nice touch and actually paired well sith the lamb. The other potatoes were on point. Would guess maybe the lamb was cooked as a rack then separated then broiled. Would like to give this establishment another try of course as the other dishes I sampled were of great quality. See a great deal of thought into this quaint upscale establishment.",

Overall the food, we can tell was slow cooked to bring the flavor of herbs and spices. That's when you know, you can rely on restaurants like this to come back. Enjoy and support your local business.",

Food was also amazing cannot recommend the Cesar salad enough the croutons are so good you\u2019ll be dreaming about them seriously. The gnocchi oxtail was also amazing gnocchi was handmade and lastly get the teramisu. Definitely gets 5 stars in my book and will be going back the service was also top notch.

We walk down to this place and have a very intimate and romantic dinner regularly and we'll continue to do so for as long as they stay open. If they keep up the fantastic service, unbelievably delicious food, and professional and courteous atmosphere, they'll definitely stay on top of one of my favorite restaurants in Tampa. It's a small venue, probably 15 or  so tables. The owner or manager is usually walking around attentively and ensuring that everything is good, which is an understatement. Everything is fantastic! I had a very unique dessert there, a little twist on a tiramisu that was possibly one of the best desserts I've ever had. I am totally a food lover and have eaten all over the world, this place is in my top 10. Maybe top 5! Try them out, you will not regret your evening. (There's also a tiny little play-house theater next door for a different fun evening with your favorite dinner partner if you're looking for a nice evening.  Im not an employee there, I just love my romantic evenings with my wife.",

It\u2019s just of a tram line so very handy from downtown.  The decor is modern, light and airy. As result this is not the place for a romantic dinner for two. It is also not very welcoming. Which was an off-putting start.  We hovered in the entrance looking lost (as did most other people) until someone noticed us from the back.  However, we did like our waiter and felt the service was overall good if a little understated (we would have ordered more drinks if someone had asked or come by the table).  The food was on the whole good, large portions, interesting combinations and well cooked.  Some odd decisions had crept onto the menu.  A beet salad that had way too few bits of beet, hardly any goat's cheese and way to much other stuff for example.  I ordered a veal chop. The veal was juicy and flavorful, the trimmings were less appetizing than they should have been.  The desserts were fun and just the right size. Avoid the olive oil cake at all costs it tasted old rubber tires. The flavor implied that the oil had been around way too long.  Despite all this, overall worth a try, but does not live up to its reputation.",

We were surprised that he personally brought our plates out and even conversed with us a bit. We had the crispy eggplant as our antipasto.. delicious! The bread was fantastic and having lived in Italy and marrying into a Sicilian family we have quite a bit to compare it to. Not only was the food outstanding, but so was the service and the friendly environment was just the cherry on top.  I recommend the house salad, very simple but very fresh and satisfying. Plus!! They have 1/2 priced wine bottles on Sundays! Very satisfied with our experience here. Sorry I hadn\u2019t come before.",

The Cena version of this was fantastic, with some innovative surprises in flavor and texture.  My wife had the baby kale Cesar; the chickpea croutons were an awesome touch! And Michael is not afraid to use anchovies to keep it authentic.  We had the gnocchi for a pasta course, which was equally inventive as the octopus.  The tomato sauce included braised oxtail, again a combination you\u2019ll not find almost anywhere! The gnocchi had a finishing touch of being lightly braised in the skillet, which gave it an even deeper flavor and texture. Absolutely delicious. My secondi was the Parmesan crusted halibut, which was seared to perfection with a fabulous faro and risotto.  Again, another twist on a theme, but next level in flavor! This superb meal was finished off with gelato and of course, some house made limoncello! In addition to my Iberian escapade, my wife and I recently made a trip to Sicily, where needless to say food is a way of life. I would put the meal at Cena on this level. Plus not only is the food exceptional, it is an exceptional value!  They are transitioning to a new menu as I type this so get to Cena and have the best of the old AND new world!",

The menu was all a la carte and very limited. For just a salad and seafood ris. and a glass of the house rose, my tab came to $35 plus tax and the mandatory 20% tip. Oh, and they were out of the item I first requested, which the waiter should have mentioned when he passed out the menus. My meal was adequate , nothing special. One in our party was very disappointed in the beet salad he had. No one was thrilled with their meal. I don't consider this place worth my time and money, so I won't be back.  Maybe Mr. Vinick can afford their prices and put up with the lack of choices, but I will not.",

Was questioned if I had reservations. No, I didn't. Was surprised to see others were sat down promptly without being asked the same. My wife noticed that the server delivered bread to the two new guests that were just seated, after us. However we didn't receive the same. Menu said another order of bread was $2, when the complimentary ones never made it. Paid too much for a bone in rib eye, that is served to you medium rare without asking you what temperature you desire. My wife excused herself to the restroom, but returned immediately. She couldn't use it being there were cockroaches already occupying the females restroom. Cockroaches?? at this high dollar, reservation based restaurant with views of favoritism towards different customers? What a mistake! Never Again!!!  Thank you for your response. I posted that review January 14, 2018. And you replied 2 days ago. \"Your establishment\" response? Are you the new management that has cleaned up the bathroom roach infestation? Did you give customers the choice of deciding the temperature of how they wanted their steak prepared? Did you tell your employees to not ask Hispanic people if they have reservations? Did you explain to your employees to bring water to the Hispanic customers? Did you explain to your employees to ask EVERYONE if they have reservations, and not promptly sit others down? I didn't want to make this review \"Race\" related as you've read the existing post. At the end of the day, Money is green. It has no preference. For you to tell me...how my lies don't seem too appealing but you thank me for my honesty, is a slap in my face! I can't make this up towards my experience at your restaurant \"Cena\". I don't just make up reviews. I write to exactly what happened in the events of \"your establishment\". Read the rest of my reviews. I have no reason to make false review or representation. I want you to know that I will NEVER show my presence at \"Cena, your establishment \", even if it was FREE and you gave me extra gift cards to take home. I speak TRUTH in my experience and I'm sorry you don't have dignity to accept it. I have no reason to lie!",

Everything about the restaurant, from the management, to the servers, and let's not forget the chef and the food, was impeccable. The staff is very warm and welcoming, and made you feel at home. We had the roasted eggplant and burrata as appetizers, gnocchi and classic bolognese for main course, and the carrot cake with some espresso to top things off. The carrot cake cannot be expressed in words. You have to see it, and devour it. We just came back from a two month trip to Europe where we spent a solid three weeks in Italy. Cena's food is at par, if not better, than some of the best restaurants we experienced in the motherland. We already made our second reservation and look forward to many more.",

We asked so many questions and he answered them l politely and with detail. Really helpful! The atmosphere is a mix between upscale bar and white table cloth. So dress comfortable/fancy if that makes any sense lol.  We had the buratta salad as an appetizer. They also serve complimentary bread with oil and balsamic vinegar. Very good as far as pre mela bread goes. Hot, crunchy on outside and soft on the inside. For dinner we had their braised beef in a red sauce and the seafood risotto. The braised beef was delicious but the seafood risotto stole the show. If you like risotto or have never had it start here. They are known for their risottos and I can see why!  We will be coming back for dessert and more risotto!",

My friend and I both order risotto dishes. They BUTCHERED them. The consistency of the risotto was more en par with sticky rice. AND they served them on cold plates!

We had to make sure our server knew we wanted an appetizer, remind her to bring silverware when she brought out our entrees, remind her to pick up the tab with our credit card sitting right in front of her on the table and she never served us with complimentary bread. A sub par service event at best.  However, she was friendly and courteous just think she was a bit scatter brained.  The food, however, the food was good. Portion sizes are more European, meaning on the smaller side but they were adequate. The food was tasty and all the flavors complemented each other with unique combinations. When our meals arrived the  plates where served a bit cooler than they should have been and might have been sitting a bit too long before service.  The ambiance is a bit too sterile and clinical feeling for me and the interior walls of concrete and high ceilings give it a very hollow sound.  Overall the experience was good and the service just a below average.",

Holy cow did they ever outdo themselves !!  The turkey was full, juicy and boneless breasts with the dark meat deboned all with a bed of excellent sausage dressing.  The sides were unbelievable as well!  All gourmet.  The perfect mix of quality and quantity.  Hats off to Chef Michael and the rest of the folks at Cena!  I don't know how you guys pulled off such a great meal for so many.  It's great to have such a professional staff so close!  Christmas meal is already planned !!  Thanks!",

The spaghetti and Italian sausage was not spaghetti served with Italian sausage but rather spaghetti served with a sausage meat sauce.  The chicken Marsala was good.

        "caption": "I've dined at Cena twice in the past two months, and I've been thoroughly delighted both times. The food is modern Italian, and is at once both rustic and refined. The attention to detail in flavor speaks clearly for what a restaurant can be when the chef is in charge.  Being Italian and loving Italian food, I have an ingrained view of what an average Italian restaurant will look like and how the experience will go. Italy and the \"old world\" are beautiful, but I do not need to be magically transported there every time I want to eat Italian food. Thankfully, none of my stereotypes were accurate at Cena. The decor is modern, minimal, and somewhat industrial, yet oddly warm and welcoming. In a word - clean.  Chef Mike introduced himself as the owner and I noticed him visit all of the tables in the dining room at some point during our dinner. I have a service background, and seeing the chef (even as an owner) do this makes me feel a lot better about the food I'm eating. The menu appears to be constantly evolving based on my two visits. The menu items seem to change with what ingredients are available - tragic if you're craving a specific dish, but also reassuring as a food lover, since you'll never be served sub-par ingredients. We were told the menu also changes with the seasons and based on popularity of dishes, which I'm happy about simply to try new creations from this chef.  The wine selection is all Italian, which I wasn't crazy about but hey - it's an Italian restaurant so what can I complain about. Low to mid range Italian wine is forgettable in my opinion, while high end Italians are unparalleled. Thankfully there was a fantastic big, bold red available without a Sassicaia pricetag. I can't remember the name, but it started with a \"B\" and had a lot of alliteration in the name. The bartender will know which one. Order that wine.  Speaking of the bartender and service in general: We only ever dined at the bar, so we cannot speak for any of the table service. Our bartender was great, knowledgeable, and friendly. Though the restaurant was new on our first visit and he did not know everything about everything, which can be forgiven as he quickly found out any question we asked - and we ask a lot of questions. The reason I wouldn't give the service a perfect score was that they seemed to be learning still, though they were fast and attentive so we were never disappointed. We spoke to some other guests who were frequent diners and they felt the same way about the service, though they mentioned they've seen constant improvement over the few months they've been open.  Overall our experiences here were excellent and we'll be back anytime we're in Channelside. The portions are the right size, the price is great considering the quality and ingenuity, the flavors are just fantastic, the restaurant itself is modern and clean, and the staff is quick, pleasant, and informed. Places like this are what Tampa needs more of, in my long-winded and humble opinion.",
