Meat was almost black after frying. Not white at all. Also you could taste nothing but old cooking oil. The Mac and cheese tasted as if a chemical was poured into it. The fries were also not good at all. Not sure if these are franchises because the other location is totally different. Even the way the food was packed I knew something was off.",

The order tracker declared that my order would be cooked and delivered between original times 6:10 and 6:35 PM. I was incapable of calling the restaurant to inquire about the delay of my food because the number they had posted on Seamless is inoperable. By the time my order arrived, the food was at room temperature. I felt inclined to reheat my food (fried catfish and fried okra) in the microwave which changed the texture and taste of my food. I usually really enjoy my food at House of Seafood Express 2. However, I will less likely order delivery from here again considering the food arrives cold and the delivery fee cost me $7.99 plus $7+ in tips. The food is not THAT great to pay the additional high costs and incapability of calling the restaurant to inquire about the delay. I am really disappointed.",
