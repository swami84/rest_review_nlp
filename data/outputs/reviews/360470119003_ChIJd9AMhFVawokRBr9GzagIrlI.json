The waiter was so friendly and the service was stellar, even during a pandemic when most places are short staffed.    They have so many different pierogis options, it was hard to choose. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try the others. Highly recommend!",

The chocolate came with whipped cream which was awesome, and I really enjoyed the potato and cheese. I like these pierogies because the skin is chewy and the inside is creamy, and it's really tasty. The chocolate one was fried, and since we got it delivered, the skin unfortunately was hard by the time we got it; I'd imagine it's much better if I had it at the restaurant itself. The chocolate one wasn't too sweet either which I appreciated. The potato and cheese was really creamy inside, and it was super tasty, a crowd favorite. The spinach and feta flavor was quite strong, but the balance between the spinach and feta was good. These three trays along with delivery was $130, and each tray had 25 pierogies. Price is a bit high, but quality was good; I would definitely consider them again for catering!",

After trying them both boiled and pan-fried,  the fried variation was far and away our preference due to the variety of textures and excellent browning. While every flavor was good, the Spinach and Feta's faint garlicky bite really stood out. Because pierogies are ordered in batches of 5 or 9, unless you're bringing a group it will take several trips to try them all.  Note: f you're looking to seat a large group, the dining room is quite intimate so you may want to call ahead or be prepared to wait awhile.  The kielbasy is awesome. If you partake in meat,  it's a wonderful plate.  A well curated selection of draft beers and wines by the glass make for a sharp accompaniment with generous pours to boot. The Czechvar lager is a wonderful option along with rotating seasonal beers and wines (Get the Gruner Veltliner ;-)  For those so inclined there is a seperate and nicely laid out vegan menu. The staff will go above and beyond to accommodate dietary restrictions as much as possible.",

I thought it was a bit funny that the guy working there kept specifically asking the white customers if they grew up eating pierogies. He also made very derogatory comments about Chinatowns.  Be careful what you order too. I placed an order but didn't specify and assumed they knew it was 9. They ended up giving me the smaller portion for some reason. When I tried to fix it, they refused saying the order already went through, making it seem like it was my fault. They told me customers always change their mind, as if I was tricking them or something, so odd.  Probably wouldn't go back just because 55 dollars for some dumplings is a lot!  You can't mix and match too, fyi.",

We decided to try Baba's because of its great prices, reviews, and a menu with some flexibility. We ordered the boiled potato and farmers cheese pierogis topped with mushrooms with sourcream and chive dip and we got kielbasy with homemade saurkraut and fresh horseradish and the cucumber salad. We took our first bites, made eye contact, and ate the rest of the meal in silence because we were engulfed in how delicious everything was!! No joke. Best pierogis I've ever had, the mustard with the kielbasy was perfect... And the service was great. The owner took our order and told us about baba's tea which his grandmother used to make for them, and you can truly feel that this is a family affair. Get that tea.. It's iced rosehip, mint and hibiscus.. Incredible.  I really can't say enough good things and I cannot wait to go back.  I am so excited that it's only two blocks away. Now I'm hungry. See you soon, Baba's.",

We tried the feta spinach, potato cheese, jalepeno cheese, sauerkraut, and chocolate! All of them were great. We bought a side of horseradish and carmelized onions to go with everything, they added so much flavor. The beer and cider were great too. Everything is fresh and delicious.  We even had to come a second day we liked them so much. Don't be fooled by how small the menu seems. Each perogie is very different and has its own unique flavor. I wish I could go back and try all the perogies they had, but it'll have to wait till next time I'm in New York!",

These pierogies are made with a modern twist and a lot of traditional skill. I like the small menu - no frills, just delicious perogies. They taste great. I usually go for the boiled potato perogies with fried onions (the classic option), but also recommend the fried mac-and-cheese perogies for something more modern.  Baba's Pierogies: comfort food done right. Do yourself a favor and check them out!",

The caramelized onions are likewise divine. The staff has always been very pleasant, the restaurant is cozy without feeling cramped (and while I've dined when the restaurant was full, it has never felt hectic). They sell Coke by the glass bottle and they accept credit card. What's not to love?",

Our waiter spent with us about 15 minutes, we talked about technology, smartphones, big names in the tech industry, security, gaming. Add this to the EXQUISITE PIROGIES and it\u2019s just a great experience.  This place is particularly good for groups if most of the people in your group hasn\u2019t tried pirogies, because there are 8 different fillings and you want to try all of them. The orders come in 2 sizes: A \u201csnack\u201d portion with 5 pirogies for $8.00 or a \u201cmeal\u201d portion with 9 pirogies for $10.50... So you only need to bring about 3 friends to try them all.  This was my first time eating pirogies and I must admit that my expectations of Nordic food were really low and that may impact my review, however... I chose this place because of it\u2019s HIGH YELP RATING, so I\u2019m not crazy giving them five starts.  Our waiter proceeded to explain to me how pirogies are the same as concept as empanadas or wontons in other cultures - To make it easy for me to understand.  Since I wanted to experience the whole Nordic culture I went with the Czech beer on tap Czhechvar and proceeded to order different fillings for the pirogies we\u2019d share at the table..  WHICH FILLING? The Spinach & Feta were the best by far with Potato and Cheese in second place.  DO YOU REALLY NEED THE SALAD? Don\u2019t waste that valuable stomach space on the salad unless you need to. We ordered the Golden Beet Salad and the Cucumber Salad and they\u2019re good and tasty and healthy and all of that but in reality, it\u2019s only Golden Beet or Cucumber with some dressing, nothing more.  KIELBASY We were not fans of the kielbasa ($9.75 and it includes sauerkraut). Try it if you must, but the specialty here is pierogies and any stomach space or money you invest in something else, is not the wisest choice.  DESSERT PIROGIES Just because pirogies are so good and sweet pirogies sounds like something you must do while here. The Crunchy Chocolate pirogies ( 5 for $8.50) that I tried were really good, A DELICACY!",

I reckon slavic people aren't as bad as they are portrayed in the movies, nor the food as boring as its reputation would suggest.  Proof: Baba pierogis! from their friendly and helpful service, to their version of the National dish in many slavic countries; pierogies! I was impressed.  Before trying to explain my blissful bite here, a quick note first. For me, a dish made to perfection is the hardest to describe. It is one of my withdrawal symptoms of an \"Euphoric Experience\" in a restaurant. So when I took the time later that day to write a review, I was obviously still under the influence, so bare with me, as I'm trying my best here...  From a peasant food in the olden times to a national dish in Poland, slovakia, & Ukraine, the pierogi made it's way through thick and thin only to end up in a freezer near you. Not bad for its legacy one might say! Hey, it even has a race named after it, The Great Pierogi Mascot Race. Not to mention a monument in Alberta, Canada. But being such a popular dish doesn't really mean it's easy to find a juicy - freshly made on the spot- Pierogi in the city. So that's why \"Baba pierogies\" is a game changer! Armed With their secret baba's (grandmother) recipe, they churn out one of the best pierogis I've ever had.  The benefits of walking in to an empty restaurant, with an empty stomach was three fold. Not only was the service really fast - it really comes in handy, when you are hangry -. Or the picture snapping of the place, easy and fun. NBut you also have a chance to talk to one of the family members about their Baba's recipe, and get some tips on local Eateries.  Less than five minutes after ordering my pan fried jalape\u00f1o pierogies, the basket came out with nine pieces ($11) a side of bacon bits ($1.25), warm sauerkraut ($1), and Helen's dip ($0.50). The combination was just pure joy. It hit all the right spots, Texture taste wise. I was happy that I decided to go with the pan fried over Boiled; that extra crisp added so much to the filling of the potato, cheddar, and jalape\u00f1o, that I had an epiphany of sorts when it comes to the latest sophistication of street food around the world. Especially when the fillings of the pierogi worked so well together, when it's not even the traditional version of it.  But let's not forget the star of the night, the one that worked tirelessly to put all of these flavors under a shining light, and highlight the harmonious flavor profile of the pierogi, the one and only: Helen's dip! Although the ingredients of this dip were simple, Sriracha, lime juice, and mayo. It didn't take away my delight of how perfect the dip / condiment was.  Pro Tip: You don't have to be Polish to become a regular here  ___________  Ps. I can only wish they'll one day bottle the Helen's dip, & sell it on its own. I'll be their first customer.",
