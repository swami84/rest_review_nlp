This is shameful and frankly dangerous as there are so many opportunities for secondary forms of contamination to enter our food, we don't know the source of where it's coming from and frankly, it's totally dishonest.

Both the dishes were flavorless and totally Americanized. Murgh kali mirch was no where close to what we were served before. The chicken was far from tender which is the key to Awadhi cuisine. The dish was overloaded with heavy cream, was under salted and I did not sense even the hint of black pepper. On biryani, I am totally speechless. All I could taste was saffron, no hint of garam masalas which is one of the main ingredients to any biryani. Needless to say that they are only catering to American clientele unfortunately. The food they serve is no where close to the Awadhi cuisine as they claim.",

So we've been going to a lot of Indian restaurants lately, and this one probably has the best and most authentic food among them. It's also not your familiar Punjabi cuisine (butter chicken), so it's still Indian but somewhat different flavors than the ones you're used to. For starters we took the DALCHA PALAK KEBAB and the KAKORI KEBAB which were both great, and flavorful. The TARIWALA chicken for main was also a favorite with a sweet twist to it. We didn't care so much for the cheese desert. The waiter was not great. He convinced us to order more bread than we needed saying it was a small portion, and although we repeatedly asked for no cilantro or parsley garnish, it was there on almost all of our dishes.",

If you like spicy you'll LOVE the green and red sauce. If you like a milder, sweeter sauce, then go brown. The chicken was so tender it practically fell apart in my mouth. Absolutely amazing. I really wish I was going to be up here longer, because i would MOST DEFINITELY return. Amazing place, amazing food, and an even more amazing, very well trained, thorough staff.

Very few North Indian places in New York do kebabs well and go beyond the regular \"Tikka masala\" staples - and this place is one of them. I would recommend getting the Galouti Kabab (minced, spiced, aromatic lamb patties) and Awadh Murgh Tikka (very tender marinated chicken baked in a tandoor)  The entrees I recommend are the Nali Ki Nihari (Curry with goat on the bone with delicious bone marrow inside), and Kofta Dilnaaz (creamy curry with cottage cheese and vegetable patties).  The reasons I'm not giving them 5 stars: 1. Their dessert selection is not great and they don't have the items on the menu half the time. 2. The host is a bit rude but it could just be a language barrier.  Food: 4/5, Service: 4/5",

Let me say, I have never been to an Indian resturaunt prior to this experience, but I went with my partner for her birthday after a great deal of research. We settled on this place, despite some of the lower reviews that we discovered are completely unfounded. Having eaten at numerous Indian eateries, my partner raved about the quality and depth of flavor Awadh had to offer. I got the Methi Malai Mater and she got the Khaas Korma. Granted, we could have shared one with the lemon rice, but we wanted to try both and were oh, so rewarded. Please, give this place a try. You will not regret it. **2 dishes and a bread app came out to $51. High quality food with reasonable prices for NYC",

It was 45 mintues before we got a drinks menu...after repeated requests. It was an hour before complimentary papad was served...after 3 asks. It took an hour and a half before appetizers could reach our table. The salad accompaniment reached the table when we had almost finished dinner ( a no no) We skipped desert as it got way too late.

Kebab was very juicy. Again some more spices and salt in kebab will just enhance the experience. Rating 4/5 Chaap ka Barrah: Best lamb chops in NYC. So juicy and full of flavor. Rating 5/5 Lagan ki Raan: Portion size was good and flavors were great too. The quality of meat they use is really good. Somehow I felt that salt was less in this dish. Rating 4/5 Khaas Korma: Great chicken dish if you looking for something with mild flavor. Chicken was very well cooked and was very juicy. Rating 4/5 Green Chutney: Most different green chutney I had in my whole life. It had very raw flavor of mint but nothing to compliment it with. There is seriously something missing in it. To make it even worse they add something sweet to it. Rating 1/5.  Overall the place has great potential and I would definitely give it another try.",

Baby potatoes in gravy were sliced up large potatoes.  Chicken Korma and Baby Potatoes gravy was the same.  All the dishes we ordered were a soupy mess on the plate.  The gravy was thin and watery.  Mutter Methi Malai was watery and had no flavor of Methi. Very disappointing meal.  To end it all, they charged us for 2 bottles of wine (instead of 1).  Let's just say, we will not be returning.",

The menu items at Awadh are not necessarily what you'd find at your typical Indian establishment; that is because the culinary staff have made it their priority to celebrate the food of a specific region that showcases sophisticated, rich flavors that are mild but booming. As I observed other guests around me, I could not help but notice the unique and exciting presentation of the meals, food that is art to both the eyes and the taste buds. Everything I tasted surpassed by expectations and certainly will keep me coming back for more in the future.  It is important to note that the service here was also exceptional. The staff were welcoming, generous, and sincere. All this being said, I am happy to highly recommend Awadh to friends, family, strangers alike.",

For a place serving excellent Indian cuisine its prices are reasonable; service is good to excellent. The specialties (from Awad, India) are always a good choice. Been there many times with two or four, and never a second-rate experience. Went once with twelve and they worked well with us to provide a feast that all (including vegetarians, lacto-intolerant, and generally picky eaters) could enjoy.",

I used to purchase Sweet & Sara marshmallows online from a vegan food supplier, after learning that (horrors!!!) \"real\" marshmallows were made from really nasty parts of our four-legged friends. Little did I know that Sweet & Sara's heavenly animal-free puffs were made right here in the NYC area~!  So, a few months ago I purchased a Groupon for Sweet & Sara, having known them and loved them for ages. And yes--when I went to redeem the Groupon online, I discovered that the shipping costs were rather atrocious. Seeing as how you can pick your goodies up at the factory in LIC if you are so inclined, I decided to do just that. Oh, treats upon treats!!! I got to meet the real \"Sara\" behind Sweet & Sara, and I'm delighted to say that she totally rocks!!!! We talked for a good long time about veganism. food politics, marshmallows, etc...then, she let me pick out my Groupon goodies from a table heaped with vegan deliciousness. Oh, the marshmallows! Oh, the s'mores! Oh, the biscotti!!!! I actually think the best thing was the vegan rice krispy treats. Oh nom nom nom to it all!!!!  I rode the 7 train home in a state of vegan sweet heaven....",
