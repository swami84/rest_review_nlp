If each store caters to a specific area then there is no reason why it takes more than 30min for an order to arrive. In my case this evening my order took almost an hour and a half to get here. Then when I called the store I was on the phone for 15min and nobody picked up. Then was cold at that. I\u2019m highly disgusted with the lack luster service provided to paying customers.",

        "caption": "Anyone who lives in Throggs Neck knows NOT to order delivery from this Domino's. You can carry out, but if you NEED delivery don't risk it from this establishment. Even if you're craving your guilty pleasure fast-food pizza, I recommend ordering delivery from your local favorites like Franks, Emilio's, Cestra's, Tommy's, Louie and Ernie's, ect (so many other pizza place options in TN). Domino's is reliable in taste as a decent \"chain-food pizza\" (Food wise: solid 3 stars) which is why people continue to order from here. The service and the order outcome is what I, and many others, have based their reviews on. My experience growing up ordering from this neighborhood Domino's has always been troubling. Since the mid-2000s this Domino's has been known to have horrendous delivery wait time and incorrect orders. After revamping their brand and recipe in 2010, my family and I has given this Domino's another chance (in fact numerous of chances over the recent years). Better pizza, same bad service. About 8 out of 10 times I've ordered delivery from here has been on average 2-3 hours wait and/or there was a error in my order. The online tracker isn't always precise and calling can lead you to either speaking with a helpful apologetic worker or being on hold for over an hour.  Tonight was the last time I ordered from here because I've exhausted my time, expenses, and patience. After two hours, hangrily I watched the online tracker claim my order to have arrived an hour ago and (I called the store on my cell phone) waited an hour on hold for someone to pick up the store phone. It was then I was told the delivery person said no one picked up phone when they arrived with the order at my house (number given -my landline phone- had not rung once) and returned to the store with cold pizzas. I refused to wait for them to redo the order, thus I canceled/refunded my order.  If you never have had this type of experience ordering delivery at this Domino's you're either lying for them or you're really lucky. Out of the almost 100 reviews skewed heavily towards 1 star with the average of 2.3, I say delivery is a gamble. Take it from my years of mistakes ordering from here and other reviews into consideration. You have been warned.",

I'd like to know why my order did not arrive until 9:30! And the food was cold!  Let's add to that by saying my kids couldn't wait up that late, and I had to make an alternative meal for them.  Try calling to store? Ha! Don't bother. You'll get an automated system that will keep you on hold indefinitely.  I've never had an issue at other Dominos, but this one? Horrible is an understatement.  I found out that the night shift manager never showed up for work, and the day manager (who had been there since 7am) was stuck covering for him/her. And 2-3 delivery people failed to show, as well as other staff. So it's understandable to see why my order took over 2 hours, but it is unacceptable.  I'd like to see more oversight of these type of branches, that are rated very poorly. There needs to more supervision from the top down to ensure quality service, efficiency and customer satisfaction at all Dominos locations.  I will never order from here again.",

Then the nasty pig had the nerve to get mad because she actually had to work !!! For a company that stands behind their service they should be ashamed of themselves and just close the doors.
