Not only does the room feel so magical and inviting, but the staff made us (and our guests) feel so special. They made sure we had everything we needed, service was so prompt and even guests with special asks were taken care of quickly. And let's talk about the food - AMAZING. Our guests enjoyed the chestnut soup, the halibut or lamb and ended the night with a chocolate dessert of your dreams. We can't wait to eat there again soon! (photos by Sarah Sayeed Photography)",

Pre courses appetizer: It was yummy tortellini and I think it was filled with smoked crab.  First course: Picked Scallop Tartare & Foie Gras Mousse Foie gras was good and I liked having fatty foie gras with citrusy jelly and freshly baked brioche. Scallop was really refreshing and I loved the sauce.  Second course: Picked Glazed Lobster & Carbonara White Asparagus I liked the idea of slicing white asparagus looks like Fettuccine and make carbonara with it. It was bit salty but they cooked asparagus perfectly. I love coconut milk and I really enjoyed Lobster with coconut broth. You need to pay additional for Lobster but I recommend to do:) We did not get Chestnut soup but we love to get that next time. People were toasting marshmallow at the table and it looked fun!  Third Course: Picked Pekin Duck & Lamb Shank I wanna eat their duck again... meat was juicy and flavorful. Fingerling yams were surprisingly sweet (I have sweet tooth, I liked it). Lamb shank was fulfilling and had a good smokey flavor.  Dessert Course: Picked Lemon Tart & Chocolate Mousse Cake Between those two, I enjoyed lemon tart more than Chocolate cake. It was just because espresso flavor was bit strong for me.  Drinks: We added wine pairing but we felt we should have could ordered drinks we like. It was so much food and drinks in the end. You can have the same drinks at the bar and 10th floor restaurant.",

After getting married at City Hall we decided to have a small family dinner at Temple Court to celebrate (which turned into 15+ people) and stay at the Beekman Hotel before leaving on our honeymoon. There are not enough adjectives to describe the excellent service and experience the staff at Temple Court and The Beekman provided on our special day. The menu which Temple Court had to prepare specific due to the size of our party was beyond delicious and unique. Even my very picky mother-in-law ate every morsel!!  The cocktail and wine menu's are amazing. The best dinner I have ever had! We can't thank the staff at Temple Court and The Beekman enough for their exceptional service. They truly went above and beyond our expectations. We will be back to both Temple Court and The Beekman to celebrate future anniversaries. Please make note we dined at Temple Court and stayed as guest overnight at the Beekman. Our stay was on a weekday and very low traffic day. We were able to take amazing photos while respecting the other guests and hotel policies. Both the hotel and restaurant make the rules easy to follow. Thank you so much Temple Court and The Beekman!! Can't wait to dine and stay again!!",

I have never in my life paid 450$ for a meal that was entirely inedible, and would actually rate this as the worst culinary experience I've ever had. My partner and I have nothing positive to say about our dinner. The menu was mismatched and trying too hard -- any restaurant that is trying to do too many things does not do any of them justice. The flavor was all wrong, the portions pathetic. The lobster tail was abominable, the octopus disturbing. The short rib equivalent to one you might get at a glorified bar. Even the bread and butter was off. I'm 99% sure I got food poisoning. This was a prix fixe menu, and we left halfway through after a wave of illness overcame both of us, and the waiter was unable to offer us our dessert to go. The service was subpar. I'm still in awe that I gave 20% putting me at nearly 500$ to leave sick and yet starving.",

Forhad was our server and was extremely knowledgeable, loved food and to recommend special entrees. We were very well taken care of during our visit. This is a bar and dining room you never want to leave. The hotel has a secret speakeasy bar downstairs. As a dining guest you may have access. It is fun to see. Very busy after 10:00, small, loud and reservations for tables are a must. Nightly music but conversations are limited with music and crowds. No children allowed. Make sure you plan ahead and have time to enjoy this gem of a hotel.",

I had the lobster thermadore and my friend had the grilled pork chop. Both meals were light and delicious. The atmosphere is rich yet cozy.

The bathroom feels as if it's a rustic wine cellar. The tables are strong and firm. The seating is spacious to the thin, and accomodating to the more voluminous.  Excellent food. Every dish I've tried has been cooked, spiced, and presented just right. Staff is friendly and generally non-intrusive. Almost everything here is of the highest caliber.  Great place for an upscale dinner with a coworker, old friend, or long time date. I've come here multiple times, however I have yet to return with the intent/budget to go all out at once with their tasting menu.  My only issue has been that the hostess clearly treated me differently after declining coat check. (I'm not saying Temple Court does this, however restaurants seem to bumble and abuse fine coats only to expect tips).  Either way, this place has been outstanding since their Fowler and Wells days. Definitely recommended!",

No effort was made to find the item, nor to make it right. I was not given the opportunity to 1) pay to check, or 2) bring my item into the restaurant. If I had known these were both an option, I would have brought it in with me to ensure they would not be stolen. There is no visible sign anywhere near the front area that states that items left there are responsibility of the patron. The staff was extremely dismissive and rude to me once this happened, they just wanted me to leave and go about the rest of their night. Drinks were way too sweet too.

Food wise and drinks 5 stars. I\u2019m giving it 3 stars for the service. For a full brunch there was only 1 waitress and 5 water/bus servers. Took over 40 mins to just get our order in and the waitress was not attentive at all. Took 30 mins to get our drinks from the bar and another 30 mins for coffee. Even though very nice. for the price of everything there should always be a waitress available.  Great atmosphere just wish the service matched .",

We arrived a few minutes early for our Noon brunch reservation and were told by the host that they didn't seat until Noon and could we wait a few minutes? Sure, why not? When we stepped aside the next 8 groups who approached the host stand were immediately sat at their tables. After a few minutes when it was \"our turn\" we asked not to be sat near the band or the cold front door. Well it was too late for that and \"this was the only table left\". The manager was gracious enough to visit our table and try to make amends but unfortunately this was the worst part of the experience: each of the three times he asked us a question our answers were immediately met with an interruption in a defensive tone. He was very combative and unapologetic and insisted that no other tables were available. Ten minutes later another group the same size as ours was sat next to the band. They requested to move farther away and were accommodated quickly. Hmmm.... Twice after this food that we didn't order was brought to our table and the runner announced a table number as if that was going to clarify if we ordered it or not. That would be normal in a diner. Our server was friendly, but unfortunately 3 out of 4 of our orders were entered wrong. We just ate what we got since we were so disappointed at this point. When we finished eating the manager again appeared with one of the three things that was incorrectly prepared and awkwardly tried placing it on top of our empty plates. We politely declined this late attempt at making it right but eventually accepted it to-go just to be done with this experience. The check featured all the incorrect things that were brought to our table and the round of drinks that the manager insisted he was buying for us. I worked in restaurants for a decade and know how hard it is to make adjustments on the fly, but it's not hard to be kind to people or to write down an order. I've always wanted to experience one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants and this was very disappointing. I don't expect anything in return for this post. I just hope they will take this feedback and make sure others do not have this experience.",

For appetizer we had the hamachi crudo, pork terrine, lamb garganelli (must order!). Entree we shared hot smoke king salmon (devine) and dry aged ny strip. Everything was so delicious and portion was quite big. Exceptional service as well.  Highly recommend the garganelli and king salmon, would probably skip the steak next time.  It was very well priced for a fine dining place. Would definitely come back again.",

Oysters were good, but the crudo, pretty amazing. My tounge is still dancing from the flavors.  I tried the dry aged bone in strip special for dinner with bone marrow. The steak was cooked perfectly to order. It had the nutty flavor you\u2019d expect from a dry aged steak. I liked that it was pre-cut. You won\u2019t get a misfiled steak that way. The marrow was also delicious.  Overall, a great spot.",

The octopus was cooked perfectly, the steak was unbelievable, the scallops were cooked evenly, and the pork belly melted in my mouth. The food was well seasoned but not over seasoned. It was a memorable experience overall. The watermelon sorbet with jalapeno peppers and sea salt doesn't sound like it should work and it was interesting. It was my fav but it was still an explosion in my mouth. Please try the food here for a culinary adventure. Also don't forget to check out the atrium. It's pretty cool.",

We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated whereas we arrived several minutes prior to our reservation. The host staff were too busy chatting away to inform us of our wait. The FOH staff walks around, clearly going out of their way to NOT make eye contact. I had to walk over to the managers after one of them totally ignored my \u201cexcuse me\u201d and waving, oh mind you they were taking selfies! I had to let them know we were waiting for our entrees for over 40 minutes at that point. The rest of the staff seemed completely oblivious to how to do their job.",

The kitchen was a snail's pace. I left an hour and 45 mins for the three course prix-fixe work lunch and in that time we never even made it to dessert! I asked for it to go with 20 mins remaining in my time slot, and I told them at that point I needed to leave for a meeting. The dessert never arrived, and I paid for it anyway. An hour and 45 minutes for to only make it through two courses is ridiculous, and the slow/bad service left a bad taste in my mouth overall.",

However it's not their first time so that isn't a great excuse. Waited 45 minutes for my table - though I was comp'ed with a glass of prosecco. The staff was a little forgetful, with my bread and also with a second round of drinks. The menu also had a typing error.  The decor inside is absolutely beautiful, and  it's a dramatic view. Great for drinks, and definitely worth a visit.",

Started with the foie gras pate, which was drowned in layer of jelly that was three times as thick as the pate and overwhelmed the flavor.  I had to scrape away almost all the jelly to enjoy the pate.  Main was the chicken, which came out cold.  I assume it died on the pass, since it took forever to come out.  Manager said he could have a new one brought out \"in two seconds.\"  I reluctantly agreed, since I was worried about being late back to my office.  It took a lot more than \"two seconds\" and was a little dry, like they just reheated it and put fresh vegetables on the plate.  Check wound up taking forever to come out, despite asking for it as I finished my chicken.  Was late back to my office as a result of both of these things, all for an entirely disappointing meal.",

Chef Colicchio blends egregiously his Italian roots with his American upbringing, presenting a selection of creative dishes that are both rich in flavor and seductive in visual appearance. The wine selection includes numerous choices from both the old and the new world. Service is top notch and the ambience really impressive and ideal for small, intimate parties, with the bar room shrouded by book shelves and the smaller dining room sorrounded by colored-glass panels covering the original brick walls. A true iconic destination for those who seek a postcard-like \"New York experience\"",

Now, this place is a Must See!  I would definitely go back for a drink and apps in the lounge, with its two story glass ceiling and vintage mezzanine.   It was totally happening, in a good way, with a fabulous crowd.  The dining room was very nice, LOTSA space between tables with booths along the wall.  It was the day after Thanksgiving, and was at most half empty during our dinner.  Why?  NYC was packed for the holiday weekend.  Our \"Man\", seemed to be the waiter/server for the entire room and was delightful and gregarious.  A total plus on what became a series of minuses.  This was a reunion for me and my two gals, and we had the best day, going from the Warhol at the Whitney to Temple Court.  We ordered the Baby Lettuce Salad which was $18.  It was unremarkable to say the least and big rip off.  What a joke, except it was not funny.  Mains were Dover sole and monkfish osso bucco.  The gals thought the sole was good, I thought it was on the fishy side and lacking that special thing the most expensive fish on any menu has.  The monkfish had flavor and was properly cooked, however it was lukewarm on the outer edge and was cool in the middle.  No bueno.  Along with the mains we were given fried potatoes and saut\u00e9ed greens.  We nibbled, we do not do fried and already had a salad.  We thought it came with the entrees and did not question it.  When I got home I saw that were we charged $9 each for something we did not order, plus tax and 25% tip.  I emailed the place and this went back and forth for months, now I give up.  I DO NOT give money to a millionaire celebrity chef.  Period.  Sum up - mediocre, misfired food, rip offed by the place, bitter espresso (really, sent it back and they brought another bitter one) stunning lounge.  Boring dining room.  Now we know why.  TOM COLICCHI NO!",

The place has a bit of an old timey feel to it that gives a great ambiance. Despite a few odd \"technical difficulties\" with the kitchen facilities the meal was delicious. The burrata was incredible, maybe the best part of the experience. The skate meniuere was also an incredibly light and satisfying dish in a lemon sauce that I'd highly recommend. Lastly, the baked Alaska for dessert is a tried and true classic that lives up to its history. I really do have to commend the wait staff and the manager for handling the hiccup they faced with grace and were so incredibly accommodating, honestly couldn't have asked for much better of an experience. Would love to come back and try their full price options after this taste.",

Just shared the most perfect (Birthday) dining experience ever with my sister Terri at Tom Colicchio's Temple Court in the historic Beekman Hotel in Manhattan's FiDi!  Wow!  Everything about the dinner was perfect... setting, food, wine and spectacularly, to the employee, exceptional, personal, enlightened, and even empathetic service!  Between my sister and I, each of us with some incredibly different life/dining experiences and expectations, and carrying along daily life's emotional baggage, we agreed that we had just experienced perfection, where we were pampered, amused,  meticulously cared for, and professionally served an exceptionally delicious and beautifully presented sumptuous repast.  AND, it was using the menu from and during NYC Restaurant Week!!!  I'm telling you, from our call to the Reservationist yesterday afternoon confirming certain items were actually being included on the day's menu, to Darren's inspired, understanding and engaging (beverage) service, through the friendly, informed, yet impeccable table service by Becky, Salvatore et al., they each were personable and provided absolutely superior interactions.  The Temple Court team took an  \"Open Table\" internet reservation \"extra note\" indicating it was Terri's birthday and proceeded to print a personalized menu, give us the best seat in the restaurant, free welcome bubbly,  consideration on the wine, and a perfectly timed 3 hour meal!  We were convinced we were Tom's most important friends.  I'm going to stop, lest my credibility suffers from too much praise.  But, I will be going back!",

When I asked the hostess when we would be seated, she said that it wasn't her fault that their online booking system doesn't compute the right amount of time.  She ended her speech with \"It's not an excuse.\"  It sounds to me like it was.  In any event, sure, maybe it isn't her fault, personally, but it's not mine either.  The restaurant had a fairly strong fishy smell, too.  The food was salty.  And despite the surly waiter going back and forth several times about steak preparation options (I'm allergic to mushrooms which is in many of their dishes), my steak still wasn't ordered how I'd asked; I couldn't even finish it.  The desert, a gaueau basque, seemed rather stale; or perhaps they were going for a hard and dry scone-like dessert, rather than a more traditional dish.  On the plus side, everything was so intensely salty that I don't need to worry about developing a goiter anytime soon.",

So much so that I can't imagine  it came out of the same kitchen my other two courses came out of. Did they find it under some table somewhere? My duck confit was simply the best I've had in my life. Perfectly crispy skin, delicious fat, perfectly cooked seasonal vegetables. Perfect. My creme brulee was also easily the best i've had in my life. There looked like there were too many ingredients going into the dish. Creme brulee is meant to be simple, and any time a chef has overcomplicated the dish I've found that taste suffers. Not in this case. Every ingredient enhanced the flavor. It was amazingly creamy, wonderfully complex and full of flavor. I'll be back here often.",

Ordered food and a drink from a table in the bar.  Food came and waited for 10 minutes and finally had to ask a second time for the drink. The woman that took my order never came back, and a different person seemed to take over. Was tough getting attention of wait staff to order a second drink. But definitely a sweet design and vibe to the place.  Update: since I'm staying at the hotel I went back and this time went to the restaurant section for breakfast. Super delicious breakfast. But sadly, the service again was not the best. Had to try to track someone down to get a coffee refill and water refill. The space on the restaurant side is really beautiful and well done.",

I work in the area and have wanted to bring my husband for lunch and drinks for a long time. We finally got the chance today. We were seated in the beautiful central court and then proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. And no one came to our table. At first we were just chatting and then noticed that 15 min had gone by without anyone coming to our table. We flagged down a guy and said we were ready to order, however that did no good and still no one came. The place was not busy at all, with many empty tables and lots of staff, but we got no service. After another 10 min of waiting we got up to leave just as someone came to pour water. By that point, I had exhausted 25+ min of my lunch hour without even ordering, so we told her we had to go. She gave a half-hearted apology and we walked out. Ended up eating lovely falafel at another reataurant nearby, but not quite the special lunch we were hoping for. Very disappointed.",

They're a little low for the table, but comfy, they would have been better to use normal height seats or a lower height table. The music wasn't overwhelming and you could have a decent conversation, due to the fact the dining area is at the bottom of a very tall atrium.  We had some donut holes with jam as a starter, they were yummy. Though I still like Riverpark's version more, can't beat chocolate sauce!  My main course was skate on a bed of spinach, which was nicely cooked, but was overpriced for the portion size. Other main dishes were more sensibly priced and portioned.  For dessert I shared a baked Alaska, which was very good.  Overall, a good experience.",
