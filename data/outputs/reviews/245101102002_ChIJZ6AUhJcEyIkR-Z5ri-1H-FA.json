Every time I visit now I am often taken by the fact that so many others restaurants in the area have changed hands , or just disappeared .

I love the rice mixed with raisins and carrots, and the lamb was very tender and delicious. The bread that comes with the meal was not my favorite, but the main dish more than made up for it. I would recommend this restaurant for sure.",

I had arrived a few minute early and was told to wait at the bar 10 minutes. I was skeptical seen the crowd. Wrong, I was seated before the time promised.

        "caption": "On a recommendation from a local, my partner and I made reservations at The Helmand, located in Mt. Vernon, near downtown Baltimore.  The restaurant boasts authentic Afghani cuisine, and has been open for 25 years.  We were lucky to find street parking steps away from the front door on such a cold night.  Short of having us sit on the floor, the restaurant had an authentic Middle-Eastern feel.  Two dining areas were set with white table linens and cloth napkins.  Although the tables seemed too wide for intimate conversation, the staff was amenable to a seating adjustment.  The star of the show was the food.  We started with the kaddo borawani, an appetizer of pan-fried baby pumpkin seasoned with sugar and yogurt garlic sauce.  This dish was surprisingly tasty, and not too sweet.  We complemented this with a Spanish red wine and a large order of Naan.  The small order of Naan would have sufficed for two.  If you are familiar with traditional Indian naan, heads up.  This naan is heartier, slightly thicker, and seasoned perfectly.  The wine list included mostly California, French, Italian and Spanish wines.  Many options were by the bottle only, but there were plenty of choices by the glass as well.  We shared a main dish, the zardalu challow.  Tender pieces of lamb seasoned with apricot, tomatoes, garlic, turmeric, and chili peppers were served with sweet, spicy turnips and challow (specially prepared long-grain rice). An interesting sauce of cilantro and lime was brought to add to the challow.  The sweet and spicy flavors of this dish were intense, and paired well with the Spanish wine.  I\u2019m not used to eating food with so much flavor; this is where The Helmand shines.  After finishing the entre, we ordered two desserts and coffee; we were pleased to discover The Helmand serves authentic Turkish coffee.  The feereny was a light custard topped with fresh fruit.  It was overshadowed by the Afghani ice cream, however.  Listed on the menu as \u201cspecial ice cream,\u201d the cardamom-infused vanilla ice cream is served on top of dates, figs, and mangoes.  Definitely our favorite.  Service at The Helmand was timely, but curt.  There was no engagement with the wait-staff; they did their job efficiently, and did not interrupt our meal or conversation.  This felt like their style.  Main dishes range from $14 to $20, with a few choices above that range (rack of lamb, for example).   The prices felt reasonable for quality food, authentic atmosphere, and prompt service.  With tip expect to pay about $50 per person, which would include one appetizer, naan, two glasses wine, two entrees, two coffees, and two desserts.  We recommend The Helmand for date-night, special occasions, or just because you haven\u2019t tried Afghani food yet.",

The only detractors were that the server that we had was a little too 'strictly business' - nothing to bring you in and make you feel welcome, etc. Aside from that, I didn't enjoy the hazelnut cake very much.  That said, the appetizers and entrees were all incredible, and would bring me back without a doubt. The Kaddo Borwani(pumpkin) appetizer was great, but even better in my opinion, was the Banjan Lagharak(stewed eggplant). My entree was Lamb Lawanda, and was very good; very tender, super flavorful.",

The pumpkin was quite sweet but not overdone and we'll cooked. Soft but not mushy. The garlic yogurt sauce on top is subtle but an interesting savory component that you might not expect from pumpkin.  I got the lamb lawand for an appetizer and this was definitely the highlight of the night with four components plated separately. The rice was well seasoned and quite delicious but there were some crunchy overcooked bits that I could have done without. The lime mint sauce was fantastic and amazing. The lamb stew with mushrooms was quite nice. The spinach side \"sabzy\" was well cooked but the flavor profile wasn't quite what I liked so used the lamb sauce to complement it.  The special ice cream dessert with cardamom and dates, mangoes was not as impressive as some reviewers pointed out and I would personally skip that.  Finally the staff were extremely busy but the water refills were extremely prompt and dirty dishes did not sit around on the table for long. Ordering however was quite delayed and could have been more prompt. Overall decor is nice albeit extremely dim.",

I was the first one there and enjoyed the food(server never brought out my drink and I had to remind her after I finished the meal) and ended up ordering another order to take home. From my first experience I figure let me start reserving online so there's no inconvenience when I get there. I reserved for 7pm and get there at 6:55pm, I get told to wait at the back. 8pm hits and I noticed two different couples just coming in the door were attended and put on tables just coming through the doors. After waiting for over an hour and seeing this happend made me feel some type of way(self explanatory)and again left to another restaurant for the 2nd time. I intended to  be a regular customer and buy two meals every time I would go there and show this business support. However after this experience, I don't think I will ever go there again.",

The Helmand was a last minute replacement and we were both blown away by their friendly, knowledgeable staff and even more so by the amazing food.  The dishes we had were all fantastic, but the one that stuck out the most was a roast pumpkin with a garlic yogurt sauce appetizer that we both could have easily had a quadruple order of each for appetizer, entree, and dessert.  Its THAT good!  Their wine selection is decent, the location is good with ample parking in a lot just down the block.  The only caveat is that the seating is close together so don't go thinking you'll get a quiet spot with your date.  Expect to talk with other guests and ogle each others meals.",

We have since gone one other time and unfortunately now live in another state but when we're in Baltimore The Helmand is a MUST.

The owner is very engaged in his hospitality and he is ever-present making sure guests are enjoying themselves. The decor includes artworks from the region and a beautiful traditional costume. Prices are very, very fair for a restaurant of this calibre. Entrees running in the $17-$18 range and capping out in the mid-$20 for steak entree (that's just delectable.) One of our diners has a sensitivity to onions and garlic and the owner and chef did blackflips to accommodate her. Truly wonderful restaurant.",

Every customer that I observed spent around 10-20 minutes to be seated around the entrance. Tables are neither occupied nor reserved, customers just had to wait till the servers could arrange the situation and greet them. I also felt a bit rushed to 'order, eat and go' as soon as possible.

The restaurant had a good number of clientele but the waiters (servers) just didn't really care.  I asked for 'no rice' and then got rice -- and then a small plate was returned to me- ('no rice') with basically nothing on it at all.  And the service interactions were almost rude-- as if the staff was saying  'we have so many customers why should we care about you '.  Know that I will not be returning again.

They're definitely trying to go for something fancier. Also, don't get the mantu. It's mostly onions and potatoes with a tiny amount of meat. Almost everyone I know makes it better.  However, the chicken kabob was amazing. Super juicy, fresh, tender, not dry at all. It might be one of the best chicken kabob dishes I've ever had.
