Overall I think the quality of food is better than most places in the area. I took off a star because of little things like that rice isn't included with the entrees. Usually when you have a group of 10 people and order a ton of food, most Chinese places will give you a couple bowls of rice. In fact, they're usually surprised if you don't want rice. But here, you have to order it for an additional cost. I realize this is pretty minor and I shouldn't be expecting anything for free, but it's a difference in the experience compared to competing restaurants.",

It was a very small fish, and it was fried very dry, like dried fish. What about good tender meat? 2: Hidden consumption. Every time you order takeout, every dish will be served with white rice. But for the last two visits, there will be an extra charge for rice! The waiter explained that eating at home is not the same as taking out.
