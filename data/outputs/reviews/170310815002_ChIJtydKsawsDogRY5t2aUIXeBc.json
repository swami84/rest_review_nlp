Met a friend for lunch and was seated by the large windows overlooking Michigan Ave which was nice. We started with deviled eggs which were a notch up with salmon on the tops. Creamy fresh and good flavor. You don\u2019t see these on menus these days do it was a nice surprise. Another neat invention was the salmon BLT sandwich. I had the salmon topped garden salad which didn\u2019t disappoint. Portion of salmon was very generous and cooked perfectly! Only thing I would say is it needed a little more dressing combined in the greens along with better portion of goat cheese. All in all it\u2019s a very nice and surprising change up from the typical regular lunch selections and easily accessible downtown. Great for special occasions, groups or even a quick premium lunch.",

Luckily, 676 was still open and the World Series was on TV for us to watch.  We both ordered drinks and then decided to share the short rib sandwich with fries.  This meat dish was heavenly, and I almost (almost) regret sharing it, because it was so tasty and flavorful.  The fries were pretty decent too, but nothing can take away from the taste of this short rib sandwich.  Seating around the bar was plentiful and there were TV's everywhere so that anyone who was in the bar could see the game on TV without straining too much.",
