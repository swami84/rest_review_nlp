The bartender was warm and informative. The waitress was aloof.  As most have noted, the restaurant is small and located downstairs. I did not like that there was no one upstairs manning what appeared to be the take out area where the entryway is. Be mindful that at night, this is not the safest especially when there is a restroom upstairs and the door is unlocked. Anyone could walk in and the diners downstairs would have no warning.
