I\u2019m new in the neighborhood just freshly moved & needed something quick & cheap for a meal since i was broke & didn\u2019t do food shopping yet, so i ordered from them, tell me how the delivery guy demanded a tip?! So i nicely explained to him that i was new here and didn\u2019t have anymore cash but next time i would tip. So he basically cussed me out in his language and stormed off. Next time comes along and i placed an order but this time i asked my husband to open the door due to my horrible experience with the delivery guy, so my husband goes and before he can even look at the receipt, the delivery guy is pointing at the tip section & DEMANDING a tip, not asking but demanding. So my husband ignored him purposely due to his disrespect, signed it and closed the door. Someone that demands does not deserve a tip. Now 3rd times a charm, i was going to place an order and the lady that answered rudely told me that i needed to tip the guy. I simply told her no i do not have to, it\u2019s not the law nor the requirement nor an obligation especially with his type of attitude and she kept forcing that yes i HAD to tip that delivery was free but i NEED to tip, so i said NO & hung up. Don\u2019t bother here if your doing delivery that man is disgusting and demands & is F**king rude! Never again!!!",
