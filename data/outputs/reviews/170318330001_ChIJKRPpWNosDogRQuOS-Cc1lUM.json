I ordered the octopus starter to share and we each got a cocktail \ud83c\udf79. I ordered the squid ink pasta \ud83c\udf5d as well as several sides for us to share including the broccolini, potatoes, and brussel sprouts. We all kept saying how good it was. My brother ordered the chocolate cake and my friends split the carrot cake and said it was the best they\u2019ve had. My friend and I topped off the evening with espresso martinis and had no regrets. Definitely worth a visit!",

Felt like a high end restaurant on first impression but the waiters wearing hoodies/casual clothing and dining area suggested otherwise. Got 2 pcs of complimentary bread with oil which was like any other Italian restaurant, nothing special. For starters we ordered: Whipped Ricotta, Frito Misto and Cauliflower. Whipped Ricotta was the best starter out of the 3, Frito Misto was salty but still edible, Cauliflower was wayy too salty that we were not able to finish it. For main meal we ordered the Risotto and Orecchiette. Risotto tasted like seafood Mac and cheese for children. Do not recommend. Orecchiette was like buttered noodles with shrimp, nothing special. Overall, prices were too high for the food and we will not be back here.",

I got the bucatini and my fiance got the risotto. My bucatini was cold and the noodles stuck together. I also wish the pieces of bacon were smaller and the egg yolk was mixed in (though it did look beautiful this way!). The risotto was incredible! Nice and spicy and the seafood was delicious! The piece of carrot cake we had for dessert was underwhelming. I would love to come back another time and try some other items on the menu!",

The cacio I Pepe bucatini was lovely, the multitude of courses left one feeling full and the value with restaurant week was excellent.  The GEM salad was better than the meatballs.  Don't get me wrong the meatballs were good but the selection of produce for the salad was exquisite.  The butcher steak was tasty as well, not quite truly Italian but it worked well Leith the whole presentation.  Service was on point and the wine pairing went well with the courses.  Dessert cake was good but I was too full to appreciate.  We had to wait for 15 minutes past our reservation but the waitress made up with some burrata and olives as a complimentary lagniappe.  Overall I was pleased.",

I figure it\u2019s a bit pricey but the food was very good and the service was excellent- must have had at least 5 staff taking care of 4 of us at different times. Fancy wine list, lots of options for shared plates, plus a selection of individual mains. I\u2019m not the hugest fan of whole artichokes, but theirs is truly excellent. Calamari was good, too. I had the scallops - delicious and not heavy. Our guest had the huge NY steak, and we ordered broccolini as a side (yum). Another in the party had the squid ink pasta. We shared a dessert - chocolate cake - OMG. If you love good food, enjoy Italian fare and have something to celebrate or someone to impress, it\u2019s probably a solid choice.",

However our only issue was with the 4-5 hostess staff we encountered this past Sat. evening.  Very rude and pretentious!!  Our party of four were not impressed in the least with the snooty attitude and treatment from  the group behind the desk.  We were \"penalized\" for missing the 15 minute reservation window by 3 minutes due to an unknown local parade blocking traffic for our uber driver.   The girls behind the desk chastised us for being late then we were made to stand next to the open booth we were told we would be seated at for 13 minutes.  Seemed to be a punishment for some reason?? There was no reason to make us stand other than to \"shame\" us and make us feel \"thankful\" to at least get a booth since our reservation had been \"canceled\" due to our 3 minute late arrival.  Needless to say we almost left due but based on a great waitstaff response and the idea of great Italian food we saw it through and had a great evening.  I can't however honestly say I would go back however due to the  pretentious treatment we received.  It was embarrassing and I'd rather spend my hard earned money at a place that appreciate's it!",

The seasonal mozzarella salad with honey crisp apples and grapes was unique and delicious!! For my entree I ordered the infamous bucatini carbonara and it did not disappoint!!! The pasta is made fresh and was absolutely delicious. They house cure their pancetta and the presentation of this dish is awesome. Definitely recommend.

The meatballs are a great dish to share, and and perfectly tender and juicy. The bucatini is definitely one of my favorite pasta dishes. The noodles are cooked to perfection, and the sauce and toppings are simple but strong in flavor. As with the other pasta dishes, you can get a half order instead of a full order, which is what I got, and I still left feeling very full.  The chocolate cake is TO DIE FOR!!! It is quite literally the best slice of cake I have ever had. And this is coming from someone who doesn't like chocolate. There are so many layers to this cake, and each layer showcases a different texture of chocolate, so there's crispiness in it, ganache, cream, sponge cake, and so on. Just so, so good. You cannot miss it if you come here.  Lastly, service and ambiance were impeccable. You can come with two people or ten and the service team will make it a great time for you. I came with a group of six last time, and the server was great in accommodating all of our needs.",

We had the swordfish special of the evening, the butcher steak, ravioli, mussels and meatballs. Every dish was splendid and paired brilliantly with the bottle of wine our sommelier chose.  Overall we were incredibly impressed and will certainly be back again!",

We came late in the evening, sat at the bar and had the delight of being served by Pam. The food here is excellent, but Pam definitely made our night even more enjoyable with top-notch customer service. We were thoroughly impressed with the attention to detail that was given to each drink being made throughout our 2 hour stay, and this attention to detail and enthusiasm is reflected across the entire restaurant and was seen in every staff member that assisted us this evening. The highlights of our evening were the mussels (cooked perfectly, but the combination of the cream in the sauce with all of the bacon and lemon flavor made us ask for extra bread because of the all the flavor), the ricotta ravioli (again, the flavor with the lemon and mushrooms and the texture of the sauce were perfect accompanists to the pasta), the coconut tapioca pudding and the sorbet float.  If you're in the West Loop, definitely give Formento's a try!",

Very spacious inside which I love so you don't feel like you're bumping elbows with your neighbors or having to shout to be heard. If the weather is nice you should sit outside on their charming patio. Thoughtful seasonal food that's executed at a high level. Knowledgeable, friendly, attentive service from the entire team starting with the hostess to the server and the runners. Love that they started offering delivery too.  My recommendations: -CALAMARI WITH PEPPERONCINI AIOLI. Who doesn't love fried calamari?! The pepperoncini aioli is awesome and I want to dip everything in it. -BUCATINI CARBONARA. No words...just order this. adjacent Nonna's. The fennel sausage is fantastic too. -SCALLOPS. I\u2019ve had the winter preparation and the most recent spring version with barley, spring vegetables, and pea puree and every time, the flavors and execution of the dish have been wonderful. -CRISPY CAULIFLOWER WITH PEPPERONI, GREEN CHILES, LEMON. Best veggie side dish/appetizer! The chiles give a nice kick and the lemon add brightness. -CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE AND HAZELNUT PRALINE. Without a doubt the best chocolate cake. Period. This is the cake I want to devour on my birthday...or any day. It's outstanding.  Next visit I want to try the VEAL PARMESAN or the CHICKEN PARMESAN I\u2019ve been seeing people rave about on social media! It looks amazing.",

Mascarpone marmalade toast was smothered with a ludicrous amount of marmalade.. sticky fingers and a 1/4 cup scooped off was the result.  And the Kale salad was slathered in dressing, that was good, but too much of anything good  will ruin even a great salad. Yes in retrospect, dressing should have been ordered on the side (my mistake) but I presumed that the salad would not be served swimming in dressing.  Bringing it (salad  of and over marmaladed toast situation) to the attention of our waiter   in the pretty empty place today -who spent more time socializing with the staff rather than stopping at our table more often, resulted in a ''I will mention it to the kitchen' remark.  Mistakes, blurred with misunderstandings, happen all the time at every restaurant, and  what separates ok places from the best, is service. Being observant and listening to patrons is how you keep people coming back.  Our waiter never stopped  by to ask how the meal was after being served, did not notice  low coffee cups (had to ask each time for a refill), did not ask or offer to remedy a complaint,  did  not realize that perhaps particialy eaten plates are often not a sign of a happy customer- when bringing  the bill (nor asking asking if it was ok), and when walking out, the two greeters smiling at us as we walked out did not ask how our brunch was... all these things tell me that somebody running Formento's is not schooling the wait staff how to listen to and observe when restaurant patrons are not happy.",

My gosh... they both were to die for. You HAVE to try the bucatini. The egg yolk at first freaked me out, but it tastes like decadent Mac and cheese when it\u2019s all mixed in together. I got the lamb chops for my main course! They had great flavor, but were very fatty. However, this was a very minor set back compared to the overall experience.

We ordered the calamari as our starter and it was a perfect balance of crunchiness and the flavorful dip they had all over. For the entree I got the Spicy tomatoes sauce pasta which was delicious. My friend got the stuffed shells with ricotta cheese and she loved her dish as well. They were very filling but if you want more I would suggest getting the full portion instead of the half size. Now here comes the disappointing part. We ordered the Tiramisu dessert which our waiter informed us would be more of a \"pastry style\" rather then the regular layered Tiramisu so we still decided to give it a try. It came out and left us in shock since it was more of a charred/burnt scone with some creme filling and not tasty at all.",

After that we sat down and started to order the appetizers  which the server explained with such detail each item and it made our choice very easy, we got the meatballs and the chicken leg. When it came out it might\u2019ve been the most flavorful appetizers I\u2019ve ever had in my life, it was fantastic. When we started to order our main dishes Our server told us about their most famous dishes and what drinks to pair them with because of the flavor combinations, we got the bucatini carbonara and the fusilli. Another server had come over to our table after we had ordered our main dish  and said that the lady who is serving us was a trainee! It was As if she had completely blended into the rest of the staff! The other server who came over to our table also helped the table next to us and we overheard the level of Extreme detail she used when describing wines for the other people to drink. Overall this experience was fantastic and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants good Italian food!! 10/10",

I am gluten and dairy free, which for most begs the question of why I would even step foot in an Italian restaurant. But, tonight you didn't just \"accommodate me\", you made me feel VALUED and WELCOME. And for that I can't thank you enough compared to the many times other places have made me feel like an inconvenience. I come to gobble up your amazing GF fried calamari, which is by far the best fried calamari in the city, even compared to the non-GF versions that I remember so fondly. So light and crispy and tender...and half price at happy hour! It's a no brainer. Tonight when my friend ordered bread and olive oil...you brought me a cup of assorted olives to enjoy. And before I could even order the calamari I was craving, my server told me about your house made GF pasta. So, I excitedly ordered that, too. But you didn't just bring me the regular serving of spaghetti or penne noodles...you brought me these fun rooster noodle shapes that I've never even seen before. It sounds silly...but these fun rooster noodle shapes made me feel special. They said that you wanted me to enjoy my food experience, just like everyone else. Thank you so much for putting so much thought and effort into my GF/dairy free experience. It means the world to me to have a safe, comfortable, fun, and delicious neighborhood restaurant to enjoy. I will recommend you to everyone and come back many times over - not only for your great food, but for your top notch family style service, and above all your heart!",

It's usually quiet at brunch (around 11am). My wife gets the traditional egg breakfast with toast. I've had the lox and bagel and the Benedict. Benedict is really good, the lox plate feels like it could be more generous for what they charge. Overall not bad for after church brunch, especially fairly classy and never crowded.",

Some places dont Like you to do that. The wine was excellent, gluten free pasta was house made....and it was the best ive ever had!  The N.Y. strip was cooked to perfection and was so flavorful.  Seriously could not have enjoyed ourselves anymore than we did.  Absolutely top notch in all categories!  Oh and the dessert!

Service: very attentive, almost too attentive. chill on refilling the water every 30 sec and dont ask 5 times if we are still working on a plate, we will let u know.

It sounds simple, don\u2019t underestimate it.  Cauliflower dish was flavorful and I loved the peppers on top.  It comes with pepperoni but they said they can make it vegetarian as well. The bucatini carbonara... I mean, those noodles are just perfect.  I didn\u2019t really get the hype around the meatballs.  They were tender but didn\u2019t care for the flavor.

He had great knowledge of the food and was super polite and professional. The busboys were also amazing. after every course they would come by and swap out our dishes and give us new dishes and utensils. The general manager also gave us a complimentary side dishes since Murphy noticed that we could not decide between the corn cacio e pepe and the crispy potatoes... both of which were amazing. They also provided us with complimentary dessert sorbet, something we were not expecting and went well with our tiramisu and polenta cake. This was our first visit and will definitely plan to come back. Highly recommend.",

Wine/Cocktail selection was good. But these are the ONLY reasons for the 2 stars.  There were 4 of us seated and we chose Formentos after  looking for an Italian place into the area. Our waiter was nice, but he teetered on the pleasant/unpleasant line. He was loud. Overenthusiastic. And simply talked too much. He was attempting to set a mood and we played along, but sometimes you know when it's forced and not genuine. He raved about the new menu. But we didn't need to be sold, we were already sitting with drinks in hand.  Now on to the food:  Whipped Ricotta - It was okay. The bread is great though. Calamari - Recommended. Cauliflower- Recommended. Rigatoni - Pasta was heavy. Not recommended. Agnolotti - The vegetarian of the group recommends. Brick Chicken - The presentation was horrible. Ill colored sauce. Randomly placed peas. 3 petite potatoes. And chicken that looked like it hadn't touch a brick or oven. The waiter described this in a way we were expecting and nicely cooked half chicken with crispy skin and juicy meat.  It wasn't a half chicken and there was no crisp to the skin. The sauce was awful and the weird smokiness flavor was confusing and didn't pair well with anything. Not at all recommended. Potatoes side dish was better - A bit of a kick. Recommended. Broccolini and Asparagus - The flavor combinations or seasonings were way off. Nothing lemon about the broccolini. And if the asparagus were cooked on wood, it was a 2x4 out back.  If you want Italian. This isn't the place. We're in Chicago and you can go to many other places for better food.",

Bucatini was sticky and lacked the flavor and richness you expect from egg and pancetta. My wife\u2019s meatball dish was similar- just ok. Service was decent, but wine didn\u2019t arrive with our dinner as requested and even though one of our party requested a dish not be spicy, it was so spicy she had to return it to the kitchen. Portions are small even though prices for pasta were $25-30. The best thing we had all night were the Shishito peppers. That\u2019s Italian!  Great atmosphere, good wine list, but in a city gifted with an embarrassment of great Italian restaurants, this didn\u2019t stick out.",

If you have a go-to Italian dish, make sure you look at the menu online ahead of time to make sure there is something you like, as typical modifications cannot be made. (For example you can\u2019t just \u2018add chicken\u2019 to a pasta dish. There are no chicken breasts in the restaurant to do that.) The meatballs are definitely something you must get! It\u2019s understandable why they are known for them!! I recommend getting the Brussels sprouts to share as a side dish. The pasta dish I ordered (Cappellacci) was amazing. Beat-juice colored the noodles, which adds to the presentation, and they were filled with beef cheek. Absolute heaven! Definitely recommend.",

However, the old fashion was made with rye and not what a member of our party was expecting.  Our table was not ready till 8:25 PM. However, the manager and waitress did an excellent job of making sure our dining experience was exceptional. We had delicious apps and drinks in the house. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent recommendations.  Additionally, our meals, drinks, and desserts were delicious. I highly recommend this place for a date night out.",

They also make GREAT cocktails. Had probably the best Negroni I've ever had here. The waitress was also very helpful and attentive. It's a great atmosphere with low lighting and comfy vibes. Whoever chose the music the night we were there absolutely NAILED it. Lots of Anderson .Paak and Childish Gambino.",
