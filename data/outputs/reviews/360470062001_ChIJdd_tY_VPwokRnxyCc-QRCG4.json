My friend and I only realized this AFTER we started consuming our orders. Kept seeing one woman always taking it off behind counter and putting it back on when walking to a table. A male entered the premises after I ate half my panini and with NO MASK ON, went behind the counter, touched everything, operated the coffee machine and even laughed in my face after I commented to a waitress about it. Apparently \u201cWe cant tell him what to do\u201d was her response. Oh okay, sure; that\u2019s nice. Let me make it very clear this establishment lost my business. I take this virus very seriously for myself, my mother, my family, and to see an establishment, which serves food, not practicing social distant safe practices is super off putting. I think what is more disappointing is the interior is really nice and warm and the food was good but that means nothing when my health is in jeopardy. I lost my appetite upon learning the Corona virus may be lurking behind the counter and encourage avoiding at all cost",

I spotted a bit of the pesto color, but I couldn\u2019t taste it. Instead, the whole thing tasted sour, as if there was too much vinegar. Regardless, at least it was very filling. My mom couldn\u2019t even finish the 2nd half.  Overall, service was very slow. They only have 2 waitresses I think. When we asked for a box for doggie bag and for a check, we waited around for like 5-10 minutes. And as I mentioned earlier, the second fruit tart never came.",
