Every one of the 5 savory courses were delicious, beautiful to the eyes and full of contrasting textures and favors. I have shellfish allergy, which the chef kindly accommodated without advance notice. The space is comfortable and the service was attentive. The tamal was so delicious that I could eat another 5-6 easily. My favorite was the Thai tiradito, a ceviche with the most yummy lime-coconut milk dressing. A spoon was knowingly provided so that the child in me did not have to pick up the bowl to drink every delicious drop. We are looking forward to going back and recommending this lovely place to our friends.",

Be aware, it is not a big space, maybe 20 or 30 seats tops, so if you're planning on going on a weekend, I wouldn't take a chance of just walking in. The menu is also pre-fixed on Friday and Saturday, but honestly, after my experience, I would eat whatever Chef Alarcon cooks me. I don't care. It's BYOB, so be cognizant of that as well.  The service was very good. With a restaurant that small, they really don't have a dedicated server. The chef pretty much brought every plate directly to us, which was really nice.  The \"mesero\" brought out some fried platanos to the table as we were getting settled, and they were great. I used to eat them when I was young, but they were just chips from a bag, and these blew my childhood memories out of the water.  We had two appetizers. My girlfriend had the Ceviche Mixto Arocotado and loved it, and I had the Anticucho De Corazon, and it was amazing. The meat had a wonderful smoky taste that immediately made me miss having a backyard to grill food, and even the potato was grilled. The sauce was spicy and delicious. This was my first experience with Peruvian corn, and it was really great as well. A little more interesting than your run of the mill yellow corn.  We shared the Chaufa as an entree, and the quality and flavors were absolutely amazing. I don't think I've had a meal that was overall this good in years. You can definitely tell that the chef cares deeply about what comes out of his kitchen, and he has a personal stake in every dish that he makes. I've had some good dishes at other restaurants, but I loved everything Chef Alarcon put on our plates. I will 100% be back, hopefully to try the weekend fixed menu. Thank you very much Puerto 511.",

The menu changes based on the season. Fridays and Saturdays they have a $60, six course, pix fixe menu which I've also had. Everything is delicious. It's BYOB and there is a wine store close by if you want something. They also offer sodas if alochol isn't your thing. It is expensive but it is worth it. Everything is fresh. I would caution that you should plan to spend about 3 hours here. The service is impeccable but they do the Peruvian way of dining and it takes a few hours.",

Out of thr three, Octopus was my favorite and I wish they offered only octopus as a appetizer dish by itself. For dinner main entree I got the stir fry steak with rice. The steak dish was really good and had Chinese twist to it made with soy sauce. Overall food was really good and cheft cares about the food.

The New York Times or Baltimore Business Journal need to get themselves down here and start reviewing this place, because it is incredible. I eat at great restaurants frequently because my parents and family are major foodies. I was raised on watching the Food Network. I lived in New York City for 11 years. I\u2019ve had some great meals. This was a top experience I\u2019ve ever had. Well done, Chef. Well done. Keep up your incredible work, your hospitality, and I hope more people find and enjoy your restaurant. The only negatives of the experience are barely worth mentioning. The location feels sketchy. There were a couple of typos on the menu. Literally, that\u2019s it. A+, 5 out of 5 stars. Bravo. Salute! Well done.",

Consider making reservations though, the restaurant seats about 20 people, which makes it very intimate but you may have to wait. Buen provecho!",

Prices really high appetizer at 12$ and more . Server was clueless as she didn't even ask us if we want to drink something or made any recommendations as I told her we are a first time diners . Ceviche is very good . Ordered medium lamb chops and got well done which is really disappointing 22$ for 3 chops smh. My husband had rice with beef and we very salty . Over all I would not recommend the place because of high prices and poor quality food plus the slow service ( we waited more than an hour for our main course)!!!",

The deformation and yellowing of Peruvian dishes that are so classic and simple do not enter my head; I don't think it's logical that you go to a place and that they bring you a letter the size of a kite and where the names of the dishes are a description of all its ingredients; fuck you read and reread and finally in a start of excitement you decide for something new - taking into account that you are not going to go to such a cheap place to eat any eggs - then you choose for example \u201can impressive experience made up of cowhide belts and huamantanga potato dice, sprinkled with a thin cream colored with andean stick, native peppers, peas from the almost wild valley of Lur\u00edn and finely decorated with peppermint from the garden of the convent of San Francisco \u201d... the waiter falls out of laughter discreetly, goes to the kitchen and says to the cook: a cau-cau !! ... And he shits out of laughter because he knows that your 150 gram serving will be served on a huge, almost flat plate and that the balance of the floor ceramics looks more like and where it is clear that the artistic part lies in the Expertise of the waiter to bring the dish from the kitchen and that the cau-cau's juice does not fall ... If you start thinking more, it takes you a long time to read the name of the dish aloud than to eat it !!!  There is no right to offer you dry foam, ceviche in crystals or panes of menestr\u00f3n, they don't fuck me, they can't sell you \u201cfried sausages stuffed with loin\u201d\u2026 that's a common and wild stuffed potato, only in this case it portion that can only satisfy a guinea pig and to pass piola they make four stripes with red oil and throw a handful of sesame seeds ... they say to give it an oriental touch. Fuck that the chef who kindly attended to you on Thursday at his place and charged you $ 300 for his performance, go out Sunday at noon on TV - three days later - in \u201ctwenty crazy\u201d Mrs. Fernandini's program and prepare Entrance, second and dessert for four people with twenty luquitas ... makes you want to go back and put a twinkle for a fool!

No hay derecho que te ofrezcan espuma de seco, ceviche en cristales o adoquines de menestr\u00f3n, no me jodan, no te pueden vender \u201ccausitas fritas rellenas de lomo\u201d\u2026 eso es una papa rellena com\u00fan y silvestre, solo que en este caso es una porci\u00f3n que solo puede satisfacer a un cuy y para que pase piola le hacen cuatro rayas con aceite rojo y le tiran un pu\u00f1ado de ajonjol\u00ed\u2026dicen que para darle un toque oriental.

The ceviche is extraordinary, as was the tamale appetizer. We ordered the wok fried rice/ pallea dish which was pretty, but slightly over done. Prices are high; esp for the small portion sizes.
