Most people who know me, know I\u2019m a scaredy cat. Well, I was brave the other day and finally came here. A friend of mine used to Awashi talk about this place and how this is his favorite place in Chinatown. This place specializes in fruit smoothies but also sells bahn mi. The smoothies looked so good in their photos and I like that they use fresh fruits. It\u2019s cash only and the prices are reasonable (one size only).  They have a pretty big menu to choose from for smoothies so you can get basic flavor ones like strawberry or they even have combinations like lychee strawberry which is what I got. It wasn\u2019t overly sweet and the consistency was really good, not too chunky or watery. Definitely want to come back and try other flavors!",
