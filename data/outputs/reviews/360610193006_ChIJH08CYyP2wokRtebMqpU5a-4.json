Fine - it's not perfect, but tell me - where else in the city can you get loco moco or spam musubi or anything approximating good hawaiian food? This place may not be perfect, but the food is good and will definitely make you nostalgic, at least a little.",

I'm from Hawaii and I can tell you that this place wouldn't stay open 3 months in the Islands.  Nobody in their right mind would support it. Totally fake but worst of all the food is awful.   I have pity on those diners who think they're eating 'Hawaiian' plate lunch.  Stay away!   And if you don't believe my review go check their Dept of Health grade.  Would you like a mouse or some rat poops with your Loco Moco?",

The sushi is excellent and all the meats are cooked perfectly. BBQ seafood mix is awesome with the chicken, shrimp, and Mahi mahi, and the BBQ short ribs and beef are super tender and delicious. Prices are reasonable and I plan to go through the entire menu. Loco Moco and the Katsu Burger look like they'd be awesome. Can't get enough of this place. Its got a nice ambiance too, definitely a good casual restaurant atmosphere for lunch/dinner with friends",
