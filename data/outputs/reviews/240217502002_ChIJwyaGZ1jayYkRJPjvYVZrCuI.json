The other tea houses I have gone to had several dozens to choose from, and each person could have their own pot.  The food selection was small.  However they did have a couple of #CeliacFriendly offerings.  I had a gluten free scone and a gluten free shepherds pie.  These were pretty good and I found them to be #CeliacFriendly.",

It's a small, charming British tea room with whimsical paintings on the wall and a picture of Queen Elizabeth looming large in the room. We invariably get the Shepherd's Pie with Mushy Peas, as we did today, which is always delicious. The British tea is great and is served in a decorative pot with matching cups. I always buy a box to take home, usually Yorkshire brand which I enjoy the most.  We go during the week which is not as busy as the weekend so we can talk with the owner, Michael Harrison, a native Englishman who enjoys sitting down with his customers to chat just like he would any friend. We really look forward to talking to him when he's not too busy. In nice weather, there's charming garden out back which is a nice spot to have lunch.  We've tried other menu items such as the Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash which are good, but always come back to the Shepherd's Pie (lamb) or Cottage Pie (beef). Desserts including eclairs and scones are made by Michael and are very good also.",

The tea was prepared just about perfectly for my taste, and the food was quite good; their beef and kidney pie and their shepherd's pie were both tasty.  The interior is small but pleasant; you could hear the Premier League game from the kitchen area.  Even better, their food items can be purchased to go at a discount; I bought six of their pies.  The only downside for me was that the temperature inside was too high; I left the place bathed in sweat. (Of course, drinking hot tea didn't help.) Still, this is a delightful little place, with a friendly and chatty proprietor, and a worthy addition to the Market Street shops and restaurants.",

It is a relaxed environment, no fast food, so plan on it being a longer affair. The owner is really nice. We sat down inside and he talked to us for a couple minutes while our scones were baking. He encouraged us to enjoy the seating in the garden for the last half of our meal and it was great, very relaxing. Final thoughts. If you are looking for a quick meal, this is not the place to go.

Alright-ish.  I ordered an Irish breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, fried bread, black & white pudding & tomatoes. The sausage was horrid, the bacon was American, not Irish, the black pudding was OK but under seasoned.  For those of you who want an authentic UK breakfast, try Brain Boru in Severna Park MD.  I also took home a frozen pork pie and some frozen sausage rolls. The pork pie was bland. The puff pastry on the sausage rolls was great, but again, the meat inside was horrid.  For those of you who crave a decent pork pie, I heartily recommend you google \"the british pork pie company\". Those guys nail it.  Atmosphere completely reminded me of an awkward trip to my grandparents when I was younger.  To sum up: it's OK but don't expect any authentic flavors (with the exception of the Heinz baked beans).",

No \"Frou-Frou\" no soup, salad or fruit as most teas are served in Maryland.  However, it is the closest this English gal has had to a tea at home at Mum's in the US!!  The big pots of tea were made with Irish Breakfast.  I like a strong tea so this was not quite as strong as I would have liked but my American friends seemed to enjoy it.  The sandwiches were fresh made with simple ingredients.  The scone was wonderful with \"real\" Devon cream not the pseudo cream most tea shops serve.  The cakes and cookies were just the right size with Cadbury's biscuits and a dense homemade shortbread.  Lovely!!  The tea was made extra more special by the garden location.  With 3 fountains it was serene and peaceful in the middle of downtown Frederick.  Heaven!!!   Can\u2019t wait to try his pie & mushy peas!!!",
