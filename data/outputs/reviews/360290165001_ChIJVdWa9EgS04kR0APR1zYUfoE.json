Upon arriving the staff was friendly and we were shown to the outdoor seating.  Honestly I only gave 4 stars because the only part of the experience I didn't like was the set up of the outdoor seating.  I'm sure it will be better once they go back to indoor seating.  The food, however, was excellent. I would recommend the Nachos, and the Pizza.  Both really good, large portions, and fresh tasting.  I really loved that they offer local Yacht Club Soda.  It's always great to see business supporting other local businesses.  Great experience!  Highly Recommended.",

I would still go back considering Saturday night was the worst service  I ever received from them. The food is good, the staff are friendly but I don't know if it was a new guy but he was horrible. What makes it even bad is we had a party of 6 and out of that 6, 3 ppl that never been to the place, so I excited for them to try the place out. I was just very disappointed with the service that night. We sat down at our table we were missing 3 forks not a big deal we got our starter fairly quickly and we put our entree orders in. I ordered the night speical which I was very excited to try. Everyone's food came out and my was last to come out again not a big deal EXCEPT it was not what I ordered. I told the server and he said they ran out of the speical. So he took my plate away and I was waiting for a menu thinking I'll just order something else, never got one I have to ask the bartender for one. I was about to order something else when our waiter came back and said they're gonna make it for you...THAT should have been my clue just to say no thanks and order the Mac and cheese but at this point he didn't give me a choice so I said whatever. I still wasn't upset just hungry. I waited for my food maybe five minutes or so when it came out it was so sloppy looking like they literally just threw it together. There was so much water on the plate the food was swimming in it. It just looked disgusting I had maybe two bits and wasn't really hungry after all if this. At this point I just wanted to leave go to wildfour to get real decent food. Our bill came and he only took part of it off the bill my boyfriend paid so he wouldn't let me see it because he knew I would make a big deal out of it which I feel is only right because with that food and how it was presented and how long I had to wait it should have been taken off the bill completely. The waiter had no communication we had to ask for a drink 3 times because he forgot and finally ask the bartender that was walking around helping ppl. Again maybe he was new or didn't know how to handle a big party but i don't know if I'll bring a big party to garden grille again. I think you guys are just good for the two of us on our regular nights. So with that being said I do like garden grille and plan to go back but I hope this will be a lesson to them to have better communication between their waiters and customers. I know ppl get busy and it wasn't that busy there like I know it can be but communication goes a long with when you're handling customers.",

But this place is great. Nice cozy place. Very friendly staff. Greeted at the door. Attentive staff. Food is amazing. I had the cauliflower and Risotto appetizer. Amazing flavors. For dinner I algas the Mushroom Pad Thai. Large portion great taste. Would never know what I ate was vegan. Busy too with people picking up take out orders.

It was amazing to find a menu where we could eat anything. And the food was outstanding. I had the eggplant parm, which is probably the best Ive ever had. Husband had the falafel, and loved it. Carnivore #1 had the portobello sandwich and raved about it. Carnivore #2 had the bean burrito for the 3rd time in a row. Cant get more of a commendation for that. She talked about the burrito the entire way there and back. The table shared the lentil chili for an app. Delicious. The service was attentive, the close tables allowed us to meet other diners and start conversations...a fantastic evening!",

Dishes I've gotten here/stole a bite of so far: Soup of the day (vegetable), sweet potato wedges, GF vegan mac & cheese, roasted butternut squash quesadilla, pastrami seitan reuben, and the classic veggie burger. I have LOVED every single one of these. My ONLY complaint was the mac & cheese desperately needed salt.  The waitstaff is always super attentive even with a constantly full dining room.  And since the dining room is usually full, there is sometimes a short wait. It's never been more than 10-15 minutes for me.",

The menu doesn't overwhelm you with a ton of choices (a good thing in my opinion), but is extensive enough where just about anyone can find something they would like. We had an appetizer which was delicious and perfectly portioned for two. For lunch we each tried the tofu BLT with avocado which was also ridiculously good. Our bill came to 35 dollars and some change which we both felt was more than reasonable for the portions and quality of food. We also both felt the wait staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive which made the experience even better. I would highly recommend giving this place a visit!",

We headed over to the Wild Flower, owned by the same people and were offered free coffee but got juice and a pasty instead. It felt like less than a 30 minute wait but I didn't actually time it. Once seated, food took longer than I would have liked to come out (I was starving before we even left home to go there) but it wasn't longer than I'd wait anywhere else. I got the butternut squash quesadilla and my husband got the saitan rueben minus the cheese. He was amazed at how \"real\" it tasted, meaning like an actual rueben. We both had enough food to take home left overs (love that). Our waitress and bartender were both super nice, friendly, down to earth. We were offered and accepted dessert on the house, Pumpkin Cheesecake. I'm eating it now and it's creamy but much lighter than typical cheesecake. I dig it. Last thing I can think of to comment on is the atmosphere. It was cute, cozy, had cool lighting decorations, but poor barstools... not very sturdy and not much room for my legs under the bar.  What else is there to say? We plan on going back for sure and glad to have found a place that's been around for 30+ years and off our radar all the while.",

It was not worth the 10.00 and I literally had 4 bites, wrapped it up to take home and e xchange for real Romaine.

Some of them do not naturally smile like Barbie and Ken, but they are wonderful, caring, happy people if you take the time to talk to them. It is ALWAYS busy there..and things get full fast. It is well worth the wait. I just hope they can expand soon to accommodate special needs people, which right now is just outside. I find they do their best and beyond.",

As an example, I ordered a portobello wrap that came with a side of red cabbage slaw.  What I got was a wrap with three incredibly small sliced of portobello mushroom, barely noticeable, and loaded with the same red cabbage slaw that was already heaped on the plate.  If I had wanted a whole head of red cabbage I would have gone the Whole Foods, gotten an organic one, grated it myself and spent less than a 12th of what I paid for a plate of red cabbage.  I also had some soup, which was very good, but again highly priced and in this case a small portion as well.  I think it gets decent reviews because there isn't any competition.",

They have lots and lots of business, so they do sometimes turn people away. For example, they don't usually make reservations for parties of less than six people.  Service is good, if occasionally slow on a busy night (what do you expect?). Friendly and super helpful.  EDIT July 27, 2009: With the downturned economy, the Garden Grille is often considerably less busy, so I've sometimes risked it even on a Saturday night.  Awesome food, excellent prices and services, would totally recommend it to vegan, vegetarian, or carnivore (no meat, but every carnivore I've brought has found something they like).  Be sure to ask how big the plate is.  Some of their appetizers and entrees are somewhat small (to me), while others are HUGE.  For example, if you order a plate of nachos as an appetizer, it's practically an entire meal all by itself.",
