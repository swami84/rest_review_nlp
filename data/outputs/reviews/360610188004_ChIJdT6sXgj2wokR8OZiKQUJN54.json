However, I will still give it 3 stars because it tasted good, I'm just a snob I guess. The saag Panner was tasty and the tandoori chicken was pretty good.  The butter chicken and nav ratan korma were not thick curries, they seem to have been out through a blender as if preparing food for a baby. Garlic naan was good and we tried the almond naan which turned out to be fantastic! Even when Indian food is sub par it still tastes good. Each dish is between 9-11 dollars and it comes with rice, which is good because most restaurants charge separately for rice.",

Like another reviewer, we threw ours out also but after calling the restaurant thinking that there must be a mistake in our order. The first person claimed \"well that's how we make it\". So i asked for a manager and i have NEVER spoken to anyone so rude. I asked if a mistake had been made and he replied that , \"no, this is how we make it and have made it for years\", he also stated that i \"should have read the description\".  Wait what, why would i need to read the description on Butter Chicken. And all we ordered was Butter Chicken and Nans. He then had the audacity to state that \"you must have wanted to order mughlai chicken.\" No FOOL, i wanted and ordered butter chicken, not what looked like chicken swimming in puke.  *** Listen, all you have to do is order it and see for yourself. But please compare it first to authentic indian butter chicken, not to This is how \"we\" make it butter chicken. ***",

Needless to say we got way more food then we thought we would which was a happy surprise because now we have leftovers for lunch! Our meal came to 40 with tip and for two people and for two meals that's a great deal!! Also they delivered, and the estimated time was 45-60min but they were here in 30min! Bonus \ud83d\ude4c the food was hot and delicious, generous portions, very tasty, and I highly recommend the appetizer sampler because it's a great value for trying out a few items, and the mulagatany soup is sooooooooo good! Best red lentil soup I've ever had in my life. Hands down. We also had the mushroom and spinach entree with tomatoes and I highly recommend that too, it was very good \ud83d\udc4c huge selection of vegetarian options, good prices, fast delivery and tasty food! 5\u2b50\ufe0f",

We ordered regular nan, goat rogon josh, chicken kadai, lamb curry, chicken curry, somosa, shammi kabab, and other things that I forgot.  Reason for the 4 stars was the goat rogon josh.  Even though the meat was on a bone, the meat was tender and extremely flavorful.  I expect Indian cuisine to have tons of bold flavors and they definitely delivered.  Caution, one of us ordered a dish to be very spicy and it was VERY spicy.  I eat spicy foods a lot and this was really spicy.  The mild and regular/normal spicyness is good enough for majority of the people.  The lamb curry was just okay because it was chewy.  The shammi kabab was surprisingly very good.  It didn't look appetizing but it was delicious.  You got the meat flavor and the coriander wasn't overpowering.  I don't think they make their own nan, but at least it was hot when it arrived.  It wasn't sitting around forever.  The sauces were tasteful and my Indian friends agreed.  I would recommend this place and I would come back and dine here again.",

        "caption": "Went for dinner with my wife and daughter and enjoyed our meal, thoroughly. When we got there a gentleman was just finishing his meal  and then we were the only people in the restaurant, which was strange, but the phone didn't stop ringing so it appeared to us that most of their customers are delivery orders... which I have read from reviews before going, a lot of people order by phone.  To the meal: The Mulligatawny soup was superb, Tomato/Lemony - very tasty, I loved it! We also had the veggie samosa's (great) & chicken liver as an app, which was pretty good - it came with delicious poori and I added some condiments; Tomato & Lime Chutney - a perfect compliment (which I almost finished on the papdam that greeted us at our table) . For our entree's we had Chicken Tikka Masala, it was pretty good... the sauce tasted a bit like tomato sauce, but it wasn't that bad....not the worst, not the best. We also ordered the Lamb Roganjosh - this was incredible! Very tender lamb, juicy and such a delicious sauce. We ordered Garlic Naan with dinner and it also was delicious.  Overall the food was very good, the prices were great and I would definitely go back for more.",
