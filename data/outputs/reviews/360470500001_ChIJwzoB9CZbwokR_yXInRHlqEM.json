Not sure what his name was, but he was active and patient with the group of kindergarteners! They were able to make their own pizza out of dough, sauce and cheese. He explained to the children how to knead the dough, how much sauce to put on and how to sprinkle the cheese on  Adults were given a sample of their apps and also some slices of their plain pizza. Everything was delicious. During the pizza making process, he did card tricks to keep the children in their seats and interested. Towards the end, he made balloon animals for all of them. Great service and great food. They were also able to serve other people while all this was going on. Very impressive!",

The baby arugula salad and pancetta pizza was fantastic, however, the tomatoes on the pizza were cold (strange to me) and they didn't have a server. I think I was just taken aback as I expected a full service spot.",
