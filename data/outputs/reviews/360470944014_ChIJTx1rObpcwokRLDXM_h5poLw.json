It came in less than 30 mins about 20-25 mins. I am a Jamaican and I love my food well seasoned and my food was well seasoned. They gave me enough sauce for me to dip my food in.

I was in Fort Greene before and during the call destined because I saw that it would take me 28 minutes to get there. So I call this food spot at 10:59pm on the dot and ask if they were open until 12am just to make sure because I know how these kinds of spots can be with Google advertisements. So a girl picks up and I simply ask her if they close at 12am, she says yes, and I say ok SHOULD I ORDER NOW OR WAIT UNTIL I GET THERE TO ORDER, she says no, you can order when you get here. So I say ok cool thank you and hang up. I\u2019m driving on the way there now regretting not putting my order in over the phone, and not informing her of where I was coming from  because I know it\u2019s a stretch but the girl is so confident that I can make it BEFORE 12am. So I get there at 11:30pm which was the approximate arrival time, and a young looking girl is behind the counter giving me the meanest look ever lmao In my head I wanted to walk out asap before my spirit came over me and have me destroy everything I\u2019ve been growing into .. so I glance at their menu while already knowing what I want..and she\u2019s like we\u2019re closed we\u2019re not taking anymore orders..(this might not be verbatim, but close enough. I tired to forget that it happened) so I go well that\u2019s why I called before I came, she\u2019s like \u201cyou called?!\u201d With the most confused look... and I\u2019m sure it was her over the phone because the tone matches the facial expressions and attitude given. So then she\u2019s like you probably called before 11:30pm.. so I\u2019m like ok so y\u2019all close at 11:30pm... and she goes yea... and then she goes \u201cI can take your order. Fried items only\u201d...so I\u2019m like you sure? ..And then I\u2019m like you know what it\u2019s ok and walk out. PLEASE TRAIN THESE YOUNG BLACK YOUTH TO SHOW PROFESSIONALISM AND  OF understanding of STORE OPERATIONS AND WHY IT\u2019S IMPORTANT TO ABIDE BY THESE TWO THINGS AT ALL TIMES IF THEY REALLY WANT TO WORK AT THESE BUSINESSES. PLEASE. Find another job if you aren\u2019t satisfied with your current one. Everyone\u2019s human, and it was late, but it\u2019s still no excuse when working a late night business.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I proceeded to order a steam salmon fillet with shrimp and was informed that there was no salmon. My husband wanted a salmon burger so I questioned why the burger was available but not the fillet. The gentleman said that the patties are pre-made. I asked if they were 100% salmon and he responded yes. So we ordered a spicy salmon burger with no tomatoes, seasoned fries, a ten piece jumbo shrimp with potatoes and broccoli. We were told an estimated wait time of 25 minutes. Upon return, we were told another 7 minutes which turned into another 13 minutes. Our order was bagged up without even being asked if we wanted to put any condiments on our food items. To say the least, I was absolutely repulsed. The fries were over cooked and so hard they cut the top of my mouth. The \u201cspicy\u201d salmon sandwich was not prepared with any of the items listed on the menu but was dressed up in a brown piece of lettuce and a thick slice of tomato. I can\u2019t even explain the consistency of the undercooked if cooked at all mush passed off as a salmon burger but my body ended up rejecting the one bite I did take. I am absolutely disgusted and disappointed. The jumbo are in fact NOT jumbo shrimp but, are instead regular sized shrimp. I will never patronize this business again. Not worth the wait nor is it worth the $30 spent on the order.",

Last time I purchased the fried snapper portion size was good so I decided to return . What the hell happened ?? Are you guys low on funds or what ? I purchased two orders of whiting with seasoned fries, one for me one for my husband. The order came up to approximately $18. When I got home I could not believe my eyes of what they put in there . The whiting was literally one fish cut in half to appear as two slices of fish. That is ridiculous !! I bought this meal with the intention to share with my child this is not even enough for myself . Whiting is a relatively cheap fish so they can surely afford to put two whole fish in the meal ! This is robbery . This is why despite the long lines at other establishments I would rather go and spend my money where you get 3 full slices of white and two side orders for relatively the same price . My advice to the owner stop Being cheap ! The food was not all that either . You have officially lost a customer .",

So I ordered (grilled) snapper and shrimp combo with a few veggies & a crab bites. I asked how long she say grilled? It'll be 15 mins... Soo almost 30 mins later I asked about it and she said another 10 mins because alot of uber orders... I was like,  seriously?? I will like a refund please. 40 mins for a fish and 4 shrimps and a few veggies? Negative. People were coming in and she wouldn't acknowledge them,  moving slowly and her face looked like she didnt care to be there. Also to add insult to injury, she had a fake ponytail that was long and poofy/ shabby and she kept going in and out the kitchen. No one had their hair covered. I saw one boys butt in the kitchen threw the opening. How are you serving food like that. They haven't got a dept of health grading yet but I'd give a C/D from what I saw. They need better customer service and everyone was young. They better off turning it into a restaurant so we know we have to wait a while. They're trying to make fast food money cooking slow food with minimal unprofessional staff. The guy from the kitchen who did my refund was cool, that's the only thing good I have to say about this place.",

They were out of certain foods how it this possible and it\u2019s not even the end of the day yet. It\u2019s not worth at all going to Sea Breeze in evening in my opinion only go there in the early afternoon during lunch. From what I noticed they only had one person in the back cooking the food and also some at cash register taking orders they need more staff. The only reason they are still in business is because it\u2019s the only Sea Food only restaurant in the neighborhood they would of went out of business a long time ago if they had a another competitor. My advice is only go here during the early afternoon on weekdays and stay away during the weekend and and evening because of the numerous order being made they can\u2019t keep with it and they short staff. The food is very overpriced in my opinion next time I rather go to Red Lobster dinner and pay for their food instead of Sea Breeze. You have been warned!",

It said food was picked up by driver and will be at my door in 7 min. I checked again and it said order canceled due to not having anymore of one of the items I ordered. Mind you I was already told that the order was on it's way to me..This is my 4th bad experience here and I promise there won't be a 5th.. You definitely lost this one but I suggest you learn how to treat and value your future customers..",

The only thing is the food does take a while to prepare but thats only because they make each and every order fresh. I believe you can call and order prior to getting there because i've had to wait about 20-30 mins depending on what i got and how busy they are at the time. Definitely a place i do go to every now and again. I believe they do work with Uber Eats as well.  Recommendation: Order your food before arriving at the store.",
