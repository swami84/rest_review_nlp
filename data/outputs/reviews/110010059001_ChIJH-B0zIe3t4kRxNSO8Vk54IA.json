The staff was attentive at the wrong times, interrupting while the Matriarch  was being honored on her 80th birthday.  They seemed bothered by a request for more bread.  When it finally arrived, it was stale.  Additionally, we waited WAY too long for our dinner.  They sang happy birthday to the table of 3 next to ours but for our table of 11, not a peep.  But the most pathetic part of our family celebration was having to do so in a ridiculously cold temperature.  I called the front desk because our waiter was somewhere NOT by our table.   I was informed by the lady up front that she would let the manager know who came by our table and adjusted the temperature. He did not say anything to us. 20 minutes later I asked our waiter to get the manager to increase the heat. The manager came over and explained that it would take some time for the four thermostats to kick in. His attitude was pretty poor and if it were my restaurant I\u2019d fire him.  In summary, the food is not good enough to warrant a return.  BTW.. still waiting on the check, which was asked for quite a while ago.  I received a response from the owner below, but Ill add it here just in case it happens to disappear...  Response from the owner 14 hours ago Mr Stamas,  First let me apologize for the experience you received on your last visit. We strive to reach the highest standards in food and service here at Charlie Palmer Steak. We would like the opportunity to speak with you directly.  Please reach out to the restaurant directly, if you care to discuss further. Thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you soon.  If YOU care, feel free to reach out to me.",

This was such a fun experience for us and we just dove right into the menu and enjoyed working with the staff to get us all the best goodies they had available.  My girlfriend is now my fianc\u00e9! We will always look back on our experience at Charlie Palmers for its outstanding steak, delicious wine, and super fun staff.  Overall a spectacular restaraunt, which we both highly recommend for anyone looking to splurge and be treated to some of the best hospitality Washington DC has to offer!  We need to go back when its no longer 'temporarily closed'!!!!! \ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Ordered Grappa after my meal and they gave me a version of limoncello when I said this is not grappa the server went and spoke with the sommelier and came back saying it is a type of flavored grappa. The waiter offered for the sommelier to come over and speak to this and I said I would love to hear this, please send him over.  The waiter left and after a few minutes he came back without the sommelier and showed me a picture on his phone of what the bartender and sommelier were trying to pawn off as grappa. Also ordered bananas foster instead got a chocolate ice cream desert.  Charlie Palmer. If you don\u2019t have it just say so. Don\u2019t try to lie to me to increase my bill.",

In the beginning, she was asked if she would like to have her coat checked, and she agreed. We were then sat by an unpleasant hostess. I didn\u2019t think much about other than I did make a comment to her rudeness to my wife. We enjoyed drinks, dinner, and dessert. Upon our departure, my wife attempted to get her coat back from the coat check. I had misplaced the ticket. When asking for her coat, she was told \u201cNO! You cannot have your coat without your ticket. It\u2019s our policy.\u201d Meanwhile it\u2019s December in DC with a high of 30 degrees for the evening and she was told she could not take her jacket home with her. She insisted on getting her coat and the same rude hostess from the beginning blocked the doors with both of her arms wide so she couldn\u2019t get through. She then fought with her about how she cannot have her jacket without a managers approval. THANK GOD I found the ticket while the wait staff was searching on the floor. After spending $330 and told that my wife could not have my coat, I will not be going back to Charlie Palmer Steak. I felt like there should have been more class here but I was mistaken.",

The atmosphere was good, the service was excellent, but the food was a little lower quality than I'd expect for the price.  My wife and I had the filet mignon, and it was cooked to order (rare), but both were very marbled.  One of the sauces served with them was a roulade that was literally poorly melted butter.  Dessert was good, but the baked Alaska had too much alcohol on it, such that I was actually worried about driving afterward.  Bottom line, this seems to be a good place to ha e a business meeting, as that seems to be what everyone else was doing.  But the fare is not worth the price in my experience.",

People expect the steak to be cooked perfectly, receive it nice and warm, and get an exceptionally piece of meat. Unfortunately, this was not the case in our visit to Charlie Palmer Steak in DC. My medium cooked steak came as medium-rare. It was lukewarm as it was probably sitting in the kitchen for few minutes. And the quality of meat was not any better than any chain restaurants. The restaurant gets 3 starts for decoration (even though the men\u2019s bathroom was not in a good shape) and one star for the food.",

Located at 101 Constitution Avenue NW CPS has so much to offer in regards to steak, seafood, and wine.  Our waiter Gustavo did an amazing job helping us with our food and drink selections.  To start my wife and I started off with the spicy margarita and 202 cocktails along with the seafood platter. Incredible \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb  Moving on for our main courses we got the filet with truffles and chimichurri sauce and the Ora king salmon. My wife said this is one of the best filets she\u2019s ever had. Although I\u2019m not a big salmon guy I decided to give it a try after I learned they only serve the top 1% of salmon here New Zealand. I am so glad I tried it. They cook it perfectly here! If salmon is your thing definitely get.  Next, we got a few more drinks. I tried The Sheldon and my wife got the Texas Mule. These two drinks were just as good as the first two drinks we tried.  By this point my wife was full, but I was told their desserts are amazing so I kept on eating haha. I got baked Alaska and the vanilla-scented cheesecake. Not too sweet, but so much flavor. I definitely both!  The restaurant itself is well maintained and beautiful. The running stream under the giant wine cooler was so cool!  Again, our waiter Gustavo did an amazing job. He brought our food out to us quickly and correctly and extremely helpful with the menu.  I believe there is a parking garage on the north side of the building for parking. However, I\u2019m not sure how much is since we parked on 1st and C street NW and used ParkMobile instead. Charlie Palmer opens at 5 pm and you only have to pay to park until 6:30 pm on the weekends. It cost $3.90. A much cheaper option compared to parking in the parking garage I\u2019d imagine.",

My girlfriend had the filet which was perfectly cooked - she also what are the red wine demi glaze on the side but the steak was so well prepared she didn't use it. I had the 25 oz prime rib which was delicious if a bit chewier than normal, but still quite tastey all the same. We finished the meal off with a banana split - two spoons.  We paired our steaks with a red cab recommended by the sommelier which was awesome.  The manager had a special treat for us and took us to a private rooftop terrace in the building and spent a good amount of time talking about all kinds of things, which we enjoyed and appreciated given the fact he had plenty of other guests to attend to.  We will definitely return for date night.",

We chose Charlie Palmer's so that we'd have a \"nice\" setting, an atmosphere that we could hear each other, as well as top notch food. Charlie Palmer did not disappoint. We had a wonderful table overlooking the Capital, food was outstanding, service was impeccable and attentive, and best of all we were able to talk and hear each other. The night was made complete when at the end of the evening the waiter asked if we wanted to see the view of DC from the roof top. Being visitors we jumped at the opportunity. We were escorted to the roof top deck and saw Washington in all its glory. It was the perfect end to the perfect evening. Thank you Charlie Palmer for making this birthday dinner over the top!",

The tablecloth was stained and the table itself was broken (the leaves kept falling and banging my knees). The bathroom was also sticky and dirty. Despite about five different servers visiting our table of four guests, they couldn't manage to bring drinks out until we were well past our first course. I had to ask several times over for the beer I ordered. Their meatballs were Chef Boy-R-Dee quality. I got a steak cooked \"Pittsburgh Rare\" style, which appeared to just be badly burnt on the outside and rare on the inside. Not sure why I thought something with \"Pittsburgh\" in the title would mean it might taste good, but it was recommended. They charge an extra $15 on top to order a steak at a steakhouse when you order off the restaurant week menu, which sort of defeats the purpose of the restaurant week price fixe menu. When the check finally came, it belonged to a different table. When our proper check came, the server promptly dropped one of my party members credit cards on the floor and walked away.  There are better steakhouses in the area that aren't nearly as pretentious and low quality. I'm not sure if my experience was poor because it's restaurant week, but it's worth saying this city-wide event isn't an opportunity to take advantage of rubes, it's a chance to promote your restaurant and get repeat visitors.",

When we confirmed, and when we arrived, they said the window seats were reserved for parties larger than ours (4), even though the restaurant was empty when we arrived (5pm) and nearly empty when we left.

Our server David P was very helpful and informative. The chef that night was Josh and everything that came out of the kitchen was amazing! We had the seafood tower that was a meal in itself and we shared the porterhouse for two. There was more than enough for the two of us and it was done perfectly. The sommelier, Brandon, helped us with a wine choice which was spot on. Our bartender, Lamar, made one of the best martini's we have ever had. On our way out he shared his secret to the perfect martini. They surprised us with a Baked Alaska for desert and a selection of sorbets. We would highly recommend Charlie Palmers's and next time we are in DC we will definitely visit again.",

I think the management must have changed because our recent visit was a terrible experience. We get there and a gentlemen comes to our tables with water and we order cocktails. He was actually super helpful and nice. He recommended the cocktail I got (which was delicious and why I am giving 2 stars instead of one). When he brings our drinks and we tell him we can order he lets us know that he isn\u2019t actually our waiter. So we wait an additional 20 minutes for our waiter to even come. The restaurant is pretty empty so not sure why there was a wait. He isn\u2019t super polite or personable but whatever, he takes our order. We ordered the special which was the tomohawk steak and we ordered it medium. It comes out 30 minutes later and is totally rare. The server never came back to check how it was cooked. The pan they served it in was really hot so we cooked the raw pieces in the pan to get them a bit more done. We have to flag down another waiter to get our check. I get home and got a survey asking about my experience and I answer honestly. They say that they will be calling me within a few days. It\u2019s been 3 weeks and I haven\u2019t gotten a call. So clearly it\u2019s not something they care about. If you want to spend a lot of money on a nice dinner (and experience) do not go here!!!",

The waiter's recommendations for our starters and main courses were outstanding, but he could have recommended anything on the menu and it would have been delicious. Being in a steak house, I ordered the Cowboy Cut Ribeye. This may have been the best decision of my life(apologies to my wife) as this was the most delicious steak I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor were eloquent as well as welcoming. If all that wasn't enough, we were seated in front of the glass side of the restaurant that has the most perfect view of the Capital Building in D.C..(breathtaking) Go to Charlie Palmer Steak, it'll be the best decision of your life.",
