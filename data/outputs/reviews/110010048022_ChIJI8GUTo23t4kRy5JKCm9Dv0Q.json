Since we sat later than our time we were pretty hungry. We ordered drinks and appetizers. We ordered the special which was herbed rice with red snapper and kuku sabzi (for Persian new year) the price was pretty high but we thought oh it will be awesome. We were very disappointed. Food was cold , rice was very dry . Definitely not worth it. I really wanted to like it but it was not good. I am not sure if they were overwhelmed because of too many people or they just got too commercialized. Also the music was too loud and it was techno music . Definitely not suitable for Persian new year and Rumi! Not sure if we will go there again , we drove all the way from Fairfax and our first impression was so good that I was very excited but our neighborhood persian restaurant has much better new Year food than they did .",

Beef barg kabob was soft and tender, not overcooked, made to perfection, exploding in flavor with each bite. I can say that was the best barg kabob I ever had in DC area. Ghormeh Sabzi was good in overall. Herbs were overcooked (overfired actually) to me, made the Ghormeh Sabzi tastes bitter a little bit. But the fact is that many people like Ghormeh Sabzi in this fashion (with overcooked herbs) . So, it's not fair if I deduct points (stars) because of this.",

They're finely diced and delicious, but not what I expected. They were super accommodating and allowed me to get the kashk e bademjoon instead which in my opinion is the superior appetizer.

I don't know how the owner can afford to pay all the staff considering the Covid situation. You have to check your temperature as you walk in. There is a small bottle of sanitizer for you to use at your table. The menu was touchless but unfortunately the payment was not touchless and you had to sign the old fashioned way.  Each time we had the Soltani kabob and paid $3 extra to get fava beans rice. The first time I liked the barg kabob a little better. It was cooked more to a medium. The second time, the Koobideh kabob leftover was a bit salty but the one at the restaurant was delicious and not salty.  We also had the Kashk Badenjoon. It was pretty good and very popular as we saw it passing by a few times. We also had the Hummus with smoked salmon. The hummus was tasty but salty. The salmon was nice and smoky. We finished up with a bowl of delicious Persian ice cream with plenty of saffron and pistachios. Update We picked up koobideh with baghelipolo. It was a little salty but tasted pretty good.  Update The koobideh was pretty good. One was juicer than the other. Falafel plate was a good value. It came with a bit of hummus, torshi, pickled beets and tabouli. The complimentary herbs and feta plate was very fresh.",

Let me give you the run-down.  *Note that they have a significant amount of heated outdoor dining space if you prefer, as well as indoor dining with temperature checks at the door.  Poussin (the hen) - I thought this was the best dish of the night! Blew me away with how tender it was. While I haven't had the boneless chicken here, one kabob rookie mistake is ordering the boneless chicken (you always get the bone-in). But wow was the hen way more tender than any bone-in chicken I've had elsewhere; and the flavor profile was this super unique lemon mix.  Soltani (mix of koobideh + tenderloin): my friends' favorite was the koobideh. I've never been the biggest fan but it was certainly tasty. The tenderloin was very good.  The lamb - definitely my second favorite dish of the night - holy cow! the subtle mint flavor really wow'd me.  Duck Fesenjoon - definitely tasty and enjoyed the pomegranate seeds and unique sauce.  Fried eggplant - definitely tasty, recommend for eggplant fans.  Rumi's yogurt - very delicious as expected.  Note that all dishes are served with lots of bread/rice (therefore you want something like the yogurt).  Kabob is great for takeout because it transports well (isn't super greasy or anything).  If I had to sum it up, if you're going to dinner with 2-3 people, my highest recommendations would be picking a combo of the poussin (hen), lamb, and koobideh, along with a yogurt dip or two.  Also I really thought the online ordering + pickup experience was excellent. Our meal was ready within about 20 mins of ordering (on a Fri night), so I'd recommend calling in that amount ahead of time rather than waiting to receive the confirmation text message that it's ready for pickup.  Looking forward to returning!",

Staff was hustling to make it all work, which they get huge credit for.  We ran in to reservation/pre-meal issues. They don't guarantee outdoor seating (I called day-of and they said \"most likely have room\" but arrive early and ask), but even when requested on arrival, the hostess couldn't estimate a wait time. Was \"soon\" 10 mins or 40? They couldn't say. First a table was \"being bussed\" and then ten mins later, \"they've paid.\" When I asked if there was an indoor table, there wasn't one available for our existing reservation. Hmm - this isn't like overbooking a flight, I'd hope. Could we order a drink while waiting? Only if you pressed the bar yourself. In the end, we waited 45 mins. A little smoothing of their process will bring their pre-meal experience up to the level of their food, which is great!",

Gaven was our server. I will say he was the best we ever had. He was so attentive. His anticipation of our needs was amazing. Our glasses were never empty, dirty dishes were cleared immediately, and we were never left waiting for something we needed. He took the time to explore our food preferences and was then able to make customized recommendations. For appetizers we ordered labne, falafel, and Rumi's Wings.  We split the Soltani Kabob meal and ended with baklava for dessert. Can I just say scrumptious?  So, so good!  The meats were tender, the flavor was delicious, and the portions very generous. During our meal the general manager Claudia came over to talk to us. She was so friendly and made sure our night was wonderful. This restaurant is a well oiled machine. All the employees work together as a team and truly make you feel like family. We've eaten a lot of Persian food over the years but this is, by far, the tastiest we've ever had. Please do yourself a favor and make a reservation now....you will not regret it\ud83d\ude0b",

All three were very plain, while mixed with flavor it wasn't out of this world someone can make at any other restaurant. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but imo it's just okay.

I could have enjoyed kabobs more if there were little more seasoning in them rather plain or adding more on top.  Could add chili sauce on the side add bit of spice to food. Service was excellent.

Highly recommend the Chinjeh Lubia Polo and the Kashk Badenjoon.

First, unlike most Persian restaurants, they non-kabob dishes are highlights, not afterthoughts. Second, it combines a modern, nice dining experience with traditional dishes that don't bastardize the food but does show creativity (for example, with the cocktails).  To those unfamiliar with Persian food, I suggest you go family style and try more than just the kabob (though that it truly excellent). Winners at our table were the eggplant dip (kashk bhadenjoon), yogurts, lamb shank, ghormeh sabzi (stewed herbs and beef), lubia polo (tomato, beef, and bean stew), and Baghali polo (herbed rice with lima beans).",

Unfortunately, the party of two sat talking for THREE HOURS (after they were already done eating and had been given their to-go boxes, they sat talking for another hour while we stood on the sidewalk by the dog poop waiting). We stood outside waiting for them to leave for an hour!!  The couple just sat with their to-go food boxes chit chatting. This isn't a coffee shop. I don't understand why the manager didn\u2019t explain that other customers are there. Hogging the table for three hours on a Saturday night DURING A PANDEMIC when there is only patio seating for 4 separate tables (and only one 2-person table). Doesn't the restaurant care about staying in business? We got eaten alive by mosquitos standing in the street by the dog poop. These people are selfish. Zaytinya and other restaurants explain there is a two hour limit for outside tables during COVID. Why didn\u2019t this restaurant do that??? Why make us wait? The food was decent but certainly not worth the wait.",

There are two aspects that make Rumi\u2019s Kitchen great and without a doubt worth a visit: The food is incredible. These are the home cooked classics that my aunts would prepare for everyday meals and large family get togethers. The renditions here could be, I dare say, better than my aunts\u2019 versions? They definitely took me back to my childhood, which is the most I could ask for. The second is the service. For those familiar with the Persian custom of Taarof, the staff does a fantastic job of making you feel welcome and comfortable. They explained and promoted the food well to my non-Persian guests, but did not push too much in a way that feels inauthentic. We left stuffed like I would after my grandmother would pile more rice and kabob on my plate, but completely happy with our service and care. This is an easy recommendation.",

The meat dishes were a bit over-cooked for my taste. The Koobideh at Shamshiry in VA is much better. The rice dishes and appetizers however were great. The portions are generous as it should be. Overall a very authentic experience with decent food.  Must stress how beautifully it was designed and the ambiance is perfection.",

We moved to the D.C. area from Alpharetta Georgia 2 years ago, and in addition to missing our friends and family, missed the meals at Rumi's Alpharetta and Rumi's Sandy Springs.  Their food and service were 1st class at both restaurants.  We were invited by friends of the owner, Ali Mesghali, to the 'soft opening' on \"L\" Street in Washington D.C.  The restaurant was amazing, the staff and service perfect, the 'social distancing' exactly as it should be, and the food, well the food was truly INCREDIBLE as usual.  Everything we ordered was served perfectly by very well trained wait staff, and cooked to perfection.  Being of Greek decent, I love lamb and I have tasted Lamb from many countries around the world and Rumi's is certainly the best.  Everything Ali does is 1st class and upscale which reflects in his restaurants.  This has to be one of the best restaurants in the D.C, Virginia area.  Well done!!",
