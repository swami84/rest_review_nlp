I asked if there was beef patties and coco bread and she said \"yes!\". Again very nasty like I was bothering her at this point. Then the 3rd and final question I asked was if they had bottled water. Guess what the answer was?! A very nasty \"no!\". What type of food place doesn't have bottled water. I settled for 2 beef patties and 2 coco breads with a root beer and a side of attitude. Finally made my way out the door without getting too pissed and then I took a bite of the patty. It wasn't good at all. There was hardly any meat, it was mainly just a big piece of crust and the coco bread was your averaged bagged bread. Is it that hard to find a good patty and some fresh hot coco bread and a bottle of water to wash it down in New York City?! What a waste of my time. I would stay far away from this place.",

While on line a woman entered the shop stood on the back of the line and yelled out to the woman behind the counter. She asked if there were any salmon patties. One of the woman behind the counter yelled back that there was only one. Once I got to the front I inquired if they had any fish dinner options but the woman behind the counter now only seemed interested in the customer who wanted the salmon pattie. She simply replied yes to my question and then preceded to call the customer wanting the pattie to the front instead of taking my order. Now a person with manners would've asked the customer in front of them FIRST if they would mind that that they quickly served a customer behind them. This woman however clearly was raised in a barn and obviously was never taught better. Even the look on her face towards me was nasty and rude. So I walked out without saying another word. I kept my money in my pocket because I refuse to hand over my hard earned money for a fish dinner with a side of nasty attitude. Unfortunately, too often there are certain neighborhood restaurants you want to support but when you walk in your not even greeted with a hello. Instead the person behind the counter (usually it's a bitter female) just looks like they hate their job and they just don't want to be there. Places like this can't have my business- sorry!",
