Sure, there's tons of other pizza places with more affordable pizzas. But when it's your hunger and taste buds at stake, it's a risk with it's reward. Also the staff is totally super cool. With their late hours and nice menu (I've tried almost everything so far), it's a pizza fanatic, night owl, logan dweller's bestest amigo. Always my go-to whenever I'm ever in the area and when my stomach speaks over my thoughts.",

She asked me in a very demanding tone what I wanted and even after taking my order she started talking to the cooks rudely as well. I was there to experience one cook ask her a question and she rudely told him to stop asking her questions. I work in customer service myself and I would never 1.

I sat at a table and waited for my order as she just stood in the back twirling her hair and not Bothering to answer the phone when it rang or help the cook in the back who seemed to be struggling and backed up. I\u2019ve been to one other rosati\u2019s location in the city and I can promise you the employees were not this rude and unprofessional.

I was disappointed in the customer service though. The female employees I\u2019ve noticed have a habit of of touching and playing with their hair then handling food which is extremely unsanitary. On the particular occasion that I came in the store the blondlish female employee was very rude. Just over all didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to be there, her tone was very dry and snarky and she was also speaking to her other coworkers like that who were trying to help her with orders. She was constantly running her hands through her hair or braiding sections of hair then touching the food containers with hair strands visibly falling off her hands onto her shirt and the counter. This honestly made me very paranoid eating my food thinking that I would definitely find hair in it. Luckily there was no hair in my food but a few long strands outside the box. If employees can\u2019t tie their hair up or at least have the decency not to constantly play with there hair and leave strains all over the place they should not be handling food. That is just gross and not what I\u2019m paying for. I don\u2019t know if the ladies are doing this out of boredom or if they just don\u2019t care about customer service but this should be handed by management right away, no one wants to pay $40 bucks for food just to have it ruined by finding someone else\u2019s hair in it. I\u2019ve noticed other reviews about management at this location as well and I would have to agree with them. The staff should be held to a higher standard than this and as of right now it seems like management has no standards for how employees should behave with customers and other co workers. I think they need to take a long hard look at the people employed at this store because some do not need to be working In an environment where they are expected to treat customers and Colleagues with respect and are failing to do so.",

Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. Ordered cheesy garlic bread, but got bread with some kind of garlic spread that covered a pretty small area of the bread, no cheese. I've had the cheesy garlic bread before, this is not it. Pretty frustrating to not get what you paid for.  I ordered online, and said the pizza should be ready in 25-35 minutes. I show up at the 30 minute mark, and notice there are a couple customers just waiting around. One of them actually just leaves, clearly frustrated. After about 5 minutes of just silence, someone finally comes out from the back, takes my payment, says it'll be another 5-8 minutes. It ended up being another 20 minutes. I'm not super upset about that aspect, it's Logan Square, they may have gotten behind because of the dinner rush, who knows. What DID frustrate me was that one of the people I thought was a customer, was actually an employee! He was just out front, blaring music/watching videos completely ignoring us, and letting someone just walk out the front door!! This particular Rosati's is new, I get it, but wow! Just flat out ignorning customers really makes the screwed up order seem much worse, same with delay.",

They make a unique, quality thin crust pizza.  My go to is meatball, mushroom, and spinach.  I have not tried the double crust yet.  This pizza is great hot and fresh.  Unlike other pizza places, the crust isn't as good as cold leftovers.  There is a lot of pizza competition in the Logan Square area.  If you look at value+quality, I would prefer to go to other pizza shops.  Rosati's provides a coupon flier with a purchase.  This helps make a slightly overpriced, quality pie at a competitive and reasonable price.",

After an initial poor experience which centered around employee training, not quality, the owner TJ reached out and spoke very honestly with me about the issue and demonstrated that it had been corrected.  The pizza and wings were great. The pizza is exactly what you would expect from a Chicago style thin crust and the wings had plenty of meat on the bone along with an abundance of sauce. This will definitely be a regular stop for my household.",

Location is a nice place right underneath the blue line California stop, and so ease of access is a 5. Seemed like there was adequate street parking as well.  It had a good Aesthetic to it! It was nicely lit and decorated to the classic pizzeria theme. There were pizzas already out under a hot lamp that you can grab by the slice as well as a full menu to order from.  I got the sausage pizza slice and mt dew can to go. Total was $7. I liked the flavor of the seasonings and cheese, it was hot, tasted fresh and was overall a good meal. It's probably something that I'd go back for, but only because of the quick and easy meal factor.",
