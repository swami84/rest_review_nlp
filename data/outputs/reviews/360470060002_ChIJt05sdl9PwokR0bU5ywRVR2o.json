We decided to go basic and evaluate the place based on their burgers. OMG were they good :-) I had the bacon cheeseburger, my partner had the veggie club, and our friend had the Roar of the Lion. The sandwiches were great. We all want to go back to see what brunch will be like and see if the Dandy Lion will be a new Bay Ridge Favorite!",

I had the coconut habanero shrimp tacos, my husband had one of their pacaos (pancake folded like a taco stuffed with fillings), and my mother in law had their falafel sandwhich. Their fries both regular and sweet potato were fried to perfection, and I tried their salted caramel shake. The coconut shrimp tacos was by far my favorite with three generously large well glazed tender on the inside and just the right amount of crunch on the outside coconut shrimp per taco.  The shake wasnt overly sweet which was a plus. A little thinner than I would like but the flavor was on point and they gave me all the fluid in the blender so I got a decent amount that I shared. I can't wait to visit again if this is how good they are already are.",

        "caption": "Delicious!  I love my Ahi Sriracha tuna balls with wasabi dizzle appetizer. Taste was so good, very subtle spice and i can taste the tuna plus the compliment of a soft taste wasabi dip!  Also got The Lion burge which is the main burger.  Its has house made thousand island dressing, aragula, baby spinach etc... It is so good that i can smell and taste the grilled burger even before the bite!  Yummmy  The place have a bar seat and table seats.  More seats at the back of the restaurant.  Kudos to the professional, friendly & hard working crews!  Highly recommended place to dine!  I will be back to this place regularly.",
