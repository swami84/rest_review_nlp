        "caption": "Absolutely do not let this place pass you by if you like sushi.  I have dined in amazing sushi establishments in Chicago, New York City, Berlin, Seattle, and this really holds its own.  A delectable summation of details makes Ako stand out from all of the other sushi places in DC that I have tried, from the sustainable to-go container, down to the aged soy sauce that doesn't smack of your average sushi fare.  I love their forbidden rice roll,  Black Magic, with its more nuanced flavor profile and who doesn't love a subtle smack of truffle.  I am also a fan of their Green Monster roll with wits very flavor addition of shitake mushroom.  Even the wasabi leans more toward a true wasabi experience versus the impossible sharpness of your standard wasabi paste.  What I would hope Ako embraces, going forward, a better selection of parings and availability with their sakes.  They should even have a bottle or two versus their single guest containers.  Although their cater to different tastes at one table, their selection barely scratches the surface of adequate pairings with the caliber of their food menu.  Regardless, I have eaten here twice and would definitely recommend, even to the more select palates.",
