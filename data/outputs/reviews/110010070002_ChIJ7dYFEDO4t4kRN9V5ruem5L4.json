Capitalizing on the fast casual trend , this place is speedy while providing a solid blend of fusion and authentic Chinese and Korean dishes. My favorites include the wok blistered Chinese broccoli, cumin lamb noodles, egg rolls (the size of relay batons from track and field), and orange-ish chicken. Other folks have vouched for their beef and Korean style rice cakes, kimchi stew, as well as the rice with furikake butter.  Try some of their banchan apps, such as pickled daikon, kimchi, and spicy cucumbers. There is some selection of vegetarian items and I like the small but curated selection of adult beverages: I personally always order the makkoli (unfiltered Korean rice wine). I really do wish they had a happy hour, but this place is usually so packed anyway that it would probably be unsustainable.  Some small quibbles: Do I wish the seating was more comfortable or plentiful? Of course! However, there definitely seems to be a culture of sharing tables and fast eating when it's busy. And while they're a little pricey as a regular take out option, they have really quick service on the take out front.  Overall, fast, reliably good food in the neighborhood.",

Coming to the food, chicken wings are a must here they were tender and the sauce on the top adds another dimension to it (don\u2019t forget to tell them to add the sauce on top). The chopped Brisket was great, it was smoky and smooth. The orange chicken is not like the regular ones you get(too sweet and thick sauce), here the chicken had a crisp and light layer on top with some greens and had a nice flavor. My friend ordered the full Monty which are 6 different kind of sides all of them are good. If you are a group of four you can share it and they are a nice pairing to the meat dishes. Overall it\u2019s a must try place and the chicken wings are worth going again and again.",

The crab rangoon was creamy and fresh. The half-a-cado salad is something I could genuinely eat every day of my life and be satisfied. The CHIKO salt in itself was enough to rave about forever! But the service was impeccable, our server, Brandon, had so much knowledge of the food and was enthusiastic about everything he put in front of us. The cooks were receptive to our questions and because we sat at the counter, it was great to see them working right in front of us. My boyfriend and I will definitely be back, and soon!",

They were absurdly hot so it was hard to eat them for a bit but I really enjoyed these.  I ordered the lamb cumin noodles and was impressed! I normally am not much of a noodle person but these noodles were thick and cooked very well. The cumin sauce/flavor really added a nice flavor to these noodles. I also got to try the kimchi stew, which was great as well.  Seating can be a bit of a problem here since the restaurant isn't that big but the service was really friendly and efficient.

If you want to do the full kitchen/bar tasting experience, make sure you book well in advance. My friend and I tried to book 3 days prior and within hours there were no slots left (mainly because the seating is *extremely* limited). Even their main dining room fills up quickly, but they do offer carry out for emergencies! We only had about a 10-15 min wait for a table, and we ordered a bit of everything: Chinese broccoli starter, rib eye and ricecakes entree, and the full monty snack bar. It was all amazing and I left completely engorged. My particular favorites were the bulgogi (rib eye) and broccoli. Looking forward to trying the Dupont location!",

They even have soju and makkoli and it\u2019s pretty cheap as it should be! This is my new favorite restaurant. I lived in Korea for 4 months and was spoiled with a korean mother\u2019s cooking. I had the bulgogi with the rice cakes. It\u2019s a great spin to bulgogi and korean Street food! I\u2019ve had delivery before and had the custard for dessert and that was stellar! Haven\u2019t had anything I didn\u2019t like. They even have korean beer so when I come back with friends I will have to show them what 2/3 mekjus feels like!",

Sat at the counter and you can\u2019t even see the food being prepared. All the heat from the stews filter over to you throughout your entire meal.  2.  Only korean food was served. I guess orange chicken is Chinese but it was prepared in a korean style.  3.  The dessert is from Dolcezza, cool...  4. The korean food is like different variations of leftover bibimbap served in little dishes.  5.  Did I mention no Chinese food?!  6.  Both noodle dishes were extremely soggy. Also soggy and under cooked were the dumplings.  7.  When you checkout they strategically place 25% tip in a way that makes you choose it over other amounts.  8.  That korean fried chicken was disgusting and had those little hairs in the chicken, even after being double fried. (Our server kept calling it pollo.)  9.  They were serving a lamb dish on their menu but chose not to serve it to those who made reservations a month in advance sitting at the counter.  So, don\u2019t bother with that \u201cexperience.\u201d  10.  The neighborhood is rough so the good news is you can take your leftovers and give it to someone walking outside the restaurant because the food was mainly rice, cucumbers and NO Chinese food.",

Korean food is very popular but many people still haven't all of their dishes. Chinese food is a miss miss hit. Yes I said miss miss hit. Amazing Chinese food is hard to come by. There are maybe 2 in all of DC that I say are cream of the crop. DC being the melting pot that it is has ultimately created this restaurant. I typically am not a fan of fusion. I always feel like fusion restaurants don't dive the really strong and fragrant flavors that make a dish. I usually experience toned downed versions of my favorite dishes. This isn't the case with Chiko...  Let's start with customer service. Victoria knows the menu inside out. She can literally describe the flavors and how they are going to burst in your mouth. Just tell her what you're in the mood for and I'm sure she will satisfy your palette. Food isn't all about flavors. It's about balance of textures, aromas, flavors, presentations which fuels the whole experience.  The restaurant is medium sized leaning more towards the small side. I personally love the industrial metal. It gives me a feeling that my food is being crafted by the Iron Chefs. It's also very upbeat and modern feeling. Hipsters you'll feel right at home.  My favorite dish was the cumin lamb stir fry. It is spicy  but to the perfect level. It gets really hot but never to the point where it's unbearable. The flavors are bold and strong. The lamb is so tender and soft. I personally love eating fat so when I got a hold of some small pieces of fat I was in heaven . The noodles had an amazing bite. They were thick enough to hold the sauce and move it around the dish. The scallions and mushrooms added earthy and fresh flavors. You just cannot go wrong with this dish.  I'm going to move right into the clams. The Chinese love they're seafood. Black bean sauce clams are a very popular dish that are a miss miss hit for me. The clams here are... just to die for. They are bold in flavor. You get some hints of soy and spice from the chili . Don't worry there is no brine flavor anywhere. The clams body held the sauce well creating the perfect bite of explosive flavors. I could order 4 of these.  I think I'm going to stop right here. I had many other dishes. I don't want to drag this review. This place has mastered the art of creating an unforgettable dining experience. If you're a fan of Chinese and Korean food you will not be disappointed. They have harnessed flavors from both worlds and married them together in harmony. I will be visiting again. I'm ordering the entire menu this time.  Update... Okay...orangish Chicken... is actually my favorite dish here (I'm biased towards Fried Chicken). The batter was light and CRISPY. You can taste a hint of orange but it's not overpowering or obnoxious like you normally get with overly sauced versions. The sweetness actually comes from sauce that's on the side and garnish that's sprinkled all over the deconstructed chicken dish.  The dish is prepared with dark meat. The chicken was just moist and utterly delicious.",

The sauce was good, when you could taste it. The vegetables seemed to have been raw and then dipped into pickling for a minute, rather than actually pickled. There were four crispy fried mushrooms, but that was supposed to be the selling point. It had a lot of avocado though, so that's a huge plus. Overall, this place would be acceptable if you had a ton of money to throw around, and didn't care for very much taste other than raw vegetables and rice.",

They've done a better job with decorating place than DC-3.  The food I ordered had good spices but needs some improvements to preparation and presentation.  The lamb stir fry was basically layers of noodles on top of the braised lamb. Not exactly stirred. It had some greens in it that were really tough. I don't mind texture but this was like chewing on dental floss.  The kimchi was fresh and may have paired better with a less spiced dish than the lamb.",

With a limited number of seating, you order at the counter, take a number, and find a seat. Your food will be delivered on small trays. Chiko was founded by Danny Lee (co-founder of Mandu) Drew Kim (co-founder of Matchbox Food Group), and Scott Drewno (formerly at the Source by Wolfgang Puck).  On the menu, there were 8 appetizers, 6 entrees, a fruit bowl, and snacks. Perfect for ordering your own or sharing with friends. The snacks are an idea taken from Korean banchan, small dishes served alongside cooked rice.  My friend and I decided to order: +Pork and kimchi potstickers ($9) +Cumin lamb stir fry ($17) +Wagshal's chopped brisket ($18) +Sichuan spicy cucumbers ($3) +Napa cabbage kimchi ($3)  We got five potstickers in a sesame dipping sauce. They're extremely tiny and quite average. I probably won't be ordering them again. The Sichuan spicy cucumbers were not the best, very surprising given how simple and easy this dish is.  The cumin lamb stir fry and the chopped brisket were the best dishes we got. The shredded lamb had noodles, caramelized shallots, cucumbers, marinated in soy sauce. The chopped brisket came with a soy brined soft egg, furikake butter, and rice. Both of these dishes were very filling and flavorful. I'm not sure if they're $17-18 worthy, but this is D.C.  It can get very loud and busy here. Service was friendly and prompt though, which is always appreciated in restaurants that are crowded and overwhelmed with people. This is not an ideal place to go with a group of more than 4 people.",

Replacing DC-3 in a tiny row house on the north side of Barracks Row near the Eastern Market Metro, comes a Chinese/Korean fusion fast casual. Open just a few weeks, it's already a favorite among locals and they are redefining fast casual food. When you walk in, it has a fast casual vibe. You walk by several community tables before going to the counter to order from their menu. As you read the menu, the items sold (and their price tags) make you realize you've stumbled upon something more. You are in a \"fancy fast casual\" restaurant.  Once you come to grips with the fancy, fast casual concept, you're bound to stay and enjoy some of the best food Barracks Row has to offer. Order any of the dumplings or pot stickers for an explosion of flavors in some bold ways. The cold noodles are also very good and well prepared. Nothing was too spicy for my weak palate.  If you want a unique DC food experience, come here. Here's to hoping Chiko is here to stay!",
