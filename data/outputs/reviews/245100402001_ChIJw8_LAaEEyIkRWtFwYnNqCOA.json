Some of my favorite dishes are their fresh naan which they always have, the butter chicken, channa masala (chickpeas curry), samosas and of course their kheer. The food is always fresh and made in small batches and I always leave there completely full and usually overstuffed because I have overeaten. Sometimes the stomach wants...what the stomach wants.

In rush hour you may have to wait for some of their best items such as Samosa and Naan, but the staff is very friendly and fast to serve at your table if needed. There is lots of space for even big groups. The price for buffet is a little higher than usual but worth it if you are going there only on certain occasions. This has been our official lunch place whenever someone is saying goodbye.",

It was a very comfortable atmosphere (nicer than I expected, since it is attached to Lexington Market, though it is its own separate restaurant) and had large tables with bench-style seating that was great for a large group. Since it's a buffet, you can eat as much or as little as you want, and it's easy to avoid anything too spicy if you're sensitive. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.",

The decor is typical, they said the price for lunch buffet was one thing but I ended up paying a much higher price. the variety of foods were lacking, not on average as well stocked as others I've dined. The food was barely  warm, and there wasn't  a lot to choose from. I requested a coke, and the man who waited my table brought me a warm soda in a can!!! not even a glass of ice, which I had to ask for. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!! And neither did he offer me a glass of water. When I paid the check, instead of $11.50 as advertised,  my tab was $17.89, which wouldn't have been a question if the food was good.
