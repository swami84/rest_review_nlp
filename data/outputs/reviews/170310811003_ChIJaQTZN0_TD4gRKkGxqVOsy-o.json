The stale crust that gets reheated in an oven, doesn\u2019t even bring it close to being satisfying. The fact that one slice of pizza costs upwards of $6, is a joke. I would easily go to Dominos or Sarpinos which is in walking distance of this establishment. I\u2019m sorry to have a bad experience because it felt like such a \u201chole in the wall\u201d kind of place. I hope they can learn from it and do better.",

I call an hour later and the guy says oh we just put your pizza in the oven, and I'm waiting for the delivery guy so it's going to be atleast 45 minutes. I explained that I called an hour ago then he goes Oh well do you want your pizza cold? I can just send it now? I ask how are you going to send it if your delivery guy isn't there..... Then he says it will just be a few minutes.  In 7 minutes he magically delivers the pizza. He then says sorry we didn't have the cokes and drinks that you asked for. I then ask how he was able to get here so quick when he said there was no delivery guy. Here is where it gets interesting... He then says look I'm the owner I walked here do you want the damn pizza or not stop being cheap. I said yeah I already paid for it and sign the receipt. This man then proceeds to say I have a bad attitude, calls me all sorts of names and then asks to fight me in my building.. I'm baffled thinking this cannot be the owner. He then says he doesn't give a damn about the pizza anymore and wants to fight now. I tell him to leave and he says he would wait all night outside to fight me. I had to laugh. Never go here or waste your money.  If this is/was the owner this place is a joke. Tall skinny build with mustache and beard and accent.",

The owner which looked like a guy out of jersey shore, told the homeless man \" Get the F out of my store\" then the other worker keep repeating it. As I went inside to buy my food, I asked the white jersey shore owner why he had kicked the poor homeless man out, he just wanted to food. He denied it, after I stepped outside again to ask the homeless man if he wanted some food,  the owner called the cops that were directing everyone away from the bars to tell me, to leave the premises, and I wasn't allowed back in. Here is a person that just spend his money In your establishment, and you denied re-entry. Then you treat a homeless man, as if he was nothing. To me this spoke big words as to the type of business this is. I would advise everyone to not waste  there money here. Obviously we aren't seen as customers but as dollar bills.",
