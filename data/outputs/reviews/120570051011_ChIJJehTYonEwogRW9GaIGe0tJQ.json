The pitcher of sangria arrived after we all finished our meals. Didn't bring out the bread that it's included in the meals until it was mentioned again. My order was brought incorrectly I asked for fresh vegetables and brought out rice instead. What was the worst is him blaming everyone else (kitchen & bar staff) for his lack of service. He would say things like they ran out of bread and sangria yet other servers would bring those items to other customers. I watched how other parties would come order eat and leave and we haven't even gotten our appetizers. Again bad service from the server. His name is Gabriel",

Unfortunately the flamenco show was good, but we were not informed by the hostess that we had to pay 15 P/P for the show while we were eating, It was not way to avoid the show, so we end up paying regardless, would be better if we were informed a head of time. After all when the time for dessert came, We were told that the cheesecake was gone because other server took the last  piece making our server to have a hard time. ( I don\u2019t care the excuses I just want to have what I want) restaurant was not ready for New Year\u2019s Eve. Also I\u2019m kind of glad I don\u2019t have the cheesecake because the server said the cheesecake was made by the owner and \u201c who knows what Kind of recipe they follow; it is better not to try! All the tables had bread to start the night, as we had to ask for it, no straws available with the water, and the Pitcher of Sangria was crack halfway! I feel disappointed big time, by the restaurant and service! I was hoping for an excellent night; we just received inferior service and a poor attitude. Hopefully, in 2021, they do better!",

What they call Serrano Spanish Ham, is the same cheap Serrano dry ham that you buy at Walmart. Has nothing to do with the original Spanish Serrano from Spain. The Paella Valencia was $22 and rest assure that is not paella. It was yellow rice with seafood thrown in there which was not even fresh. On top of that, they have a guy playing guitar which doesn't even interact with the public what so ever and has a face that you can tell he hates his job.  To the point that ones he's done no one even claps. That's how sad it is. In addition to our waitress been so lost and disoriented that you could tell he never worked in a restaurant in his life. After been there for 45 min he comes with the bread and then asks if we would like the appetizer first. It's an appetizer dude, of course, we wanted first.  This restaurant is stealing money from customers left and right. Am originally from Spain and I've been to many Spanish Restaurants, this is not Spain food people. The owner of this place seriously needs to consider hiring a new chef or looking for a different business because this one is going downhill soon.",

Lunch was about 11 dollars and change which doesn't include a beverage, and the quality of the food wasn't worth that much for lunch. A typical lunch in downtown Tampa should be in the 7 or 8 dollar range (based on me working downtown for 6 years). The location inside is actually quite nice an all white dining area with white chairs, the place does look a bit classy, but the food is just decent not bad, but not good enough to tell people about and recommend the joint. If you are looking for something different I wouldn't tell you not to go there, but expect an average meal for an above average price. They do have a couple of dishes that are pretty good (pulled pork) they don't include the stuffed white fish and the, fried palinoma steak. I probably visit this place once a year after I'm tired of repeating everything else.",

We had the Pulpo a la Gallega, which was so tender and so flavorful, Beef Empanadas, and Tortilla Espanola, which had the right amount of onions.  These were outstanding! The bartender was very friendly and definitely took care of us.  While we sat there, the place started to fill up. I heard there is entertainment there but we left before that.  Place was clean and big.  Will definitely go back when visiting Tampa.",

I\u2019m picky about my flan, being of Castilian descent. This was a beautiful flan with a generous sauce underneath.  My Mama would be proud of this flan! They fresh prep all their food, and it\u2019s obvious. Feeding 50 of us cafeteria style is tough. Pleasing teenagers is tough. They succeeded in spades. What\u2019s more... they were pleasant, kind, and had even a marvelous conga & steel acoustic guitar duo entertaining us all evening. Nicola and Roberto were fabulous! Of special note, one of my students had a terrible cold & I asked if they would send us back to the hotel with a bit of salt so she could gargle with salt water. Alfredo, the owner, gave me a nice large cup of sea salt to bring back with us. What a kind soul.",

The lighting was low which is notmal while at donner but menu was printed so small it was hard to read so we asked for suggestions from the staff Maybe we just ordered the wrong items but we didn't like the food. Everything we ordered was breaded or full of corn meal. Very heavy. Croquetas were all corn meal, only a few pieces of meat. Same with the stuffed crab, all meal, barely any meat. Sangria wasn't great, made w cheap wine we all had headaches later. I was hoping this would restaurant would be as amazing as Ceviches or Bulla but not even close.",

As I looked around the table, I wished I had been more adventurous in my ordering as everything looked delicious. We were there on a show night which was worth much than the $10 cover. Thr music and dancing really made for an atmosphere to transport guests to Spain. The only downfall was we were there with a large group, which the table was easily able to accommodate, but took a very long time for all us to get our checks. Other than that, highly recommend Spain to anyone and I will be going back.",

Apparently he makes the best mojitos in town so don't forget to ask for him by name! ;)  (His sangrias are good too!)The tapas were yummy and so pretty.  I've always believed that you eat first with your eyes and everything looked good enough to eat!  It was all fresh made and piping hot and very tasty!  The prices are reasonable and the portions are fair.  The atmosphere is very relaxing so come in and sit at the bar or grab a table!",
