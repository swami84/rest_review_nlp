I special order her grain free nola (my absolute favorite) and daily fresh baked cookies, breads, pies and cinnamon rolls are to die for.

I\u2019ve been following Ingrained on Instagram for a long time and wanted to get my hands on some of their items, so I decided to make a pit stop in Chicago. I reached out to the owners before my trip to see what my order options were and they did everything possible to help me get what I wanted. Since most items are frozen, I was able to reserve items from their menu throughout the week before my arrival in Chicago. Everything I\u2019ve had from my order has been amazing and I would recommend Ingrained to anyone looking for some flavorful treats and for a great customer experience. I will definitely be going there again anytime I\u2019m in Chicago in the future. Thanks to Andrew and Sydney for running a terrific business!",

Every time I think I\u2019ve seen/tried it all and found my favorite, she surprises me with something even better.

Syd has created something really special - A way to treat yourself in not only a guilt free way, but a way that makes you feel proud, satiated, and nourished. It\u2019s a whole new level of self love. My fridge is stacked and I hide them in the back behind other food items  when friends come over so I don\u2019t have to share (not sorry).
