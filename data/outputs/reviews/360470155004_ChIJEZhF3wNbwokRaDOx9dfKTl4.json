I managed to get through about 10 minutes after and was told that it was too late to revise because the delivery guy was just about to leave.  Small businesses are closing left and right, customer service should be at the utmost standard during times like this.  A proper recovery to the situation would have been to make the changes to the burger with the understanding that there would be a delay in the delivery.  This is how you lose customers. Sorry.",

I had a BLT, my favorite sandwich, made with hormone-free bacon, organic veggies and some deliciously toasted white bread. (I know, I know, I should have gotten the whole grain.) This place aims HIGH. I mean, really HIGH. There is quality everywhere and the staff is about the friendliest I have seen in the neighborhood, which is Park Slope, Brooklyn.  So come: Prepare to be dazzled. I your aim is for dinner, I suggest the sunset before the weather gets too cold. There is a patio.  There is organic wine. There are great beers on tap.  So, Dear Reader, you must understand: I plied my trade as a newspaper reporter for quite a long while.  I learned, during my visit, that Burger Village, now in its fourth year of operation, is owned by Indians. That would be folk from South East Asia.  This makes the most sense to me: They have a profound respect for what we put into our bodies.  Hat's off to Burger Village! And when I do have my one burger this year, it will be here! --- Karen Donovan",

This location used to be Cheeburger Cheeburger, a strictly meat-only establishment.  I'm sure that due to this new restaurant being in Park Slope full of educated people with vastly different nutritional lifestyles, serving burgers with meat and non-meat options was a smart move to corner both markets.  My son ordered a beef burger; I ordered the Impossible Burger, a vegan burger that tasted amazingly meat-like.  For the vegans out there, there were five vegan burger options to choose from.  Pretty much everything in this place is organic including the bottles of ketchup and mustard that were standing at each table.  There are eight different salads to choose from, but we didn't order any salads during our visit.  The fresh-cut fries that my son ordered were delicious.  I ordered a bottle of locally-made kombucha that tasted better than most other brands I've tried.  There was a good vibe in this place full of happy workers.  By the time the dessert menu came, I was too stuffed to order.  I would definitely come back to this place to order the same food again, or maybe try another vegan burger option from their menu even though I can still salivate for another Impossible Burger.",

There was no one at the host stand and 2 ladies behind the bar talking to one another. No one greeted me. There were no signs about if I should seat myself or wait to be seated. I grabbed a menu and moved closer to the bar... Still no one acknowledged me. Finally someone walked in my direction who was either a server or hostess (I couldn't tell) and I asked her if I could sit anywhere. She said yes. So I picked a seat and continued to look over the menu I had grabbed. The woman then went to the host stand and greeted a customer who came after me. I sat there for a while with no one acknowledging me. I wondered if you had to go place your order at the bar... until I saw a server walk by with a bunch of drinks. Nope, seemed like table service and they were just not serving me. I also decided that I didn't want to give my money to a place that wouldn't at least try to greet me or inform me of how I was to give them my money lol. So I left. I won't be back.",

Manager is a trained to argue with customers in front of other customers who have the same complaints about their experience after making them wait 15 minutes to talk with him, and telling each of us not to mention the same problem, that he's talking about the one problem (which he was trained to appease by offering free dessert). Claims he made the (cold burger I waited nearly an hour for, as did the family at the table next to me). Was he the manager or a burger flipper? He would only offer me another burger instead of taking care of the one they already served bad (would the next one take 2 hours?). He asked if I shouldn't have to pay for the burger, I said I'm happy to pay for the draught beer, it was lovely, but I don't know about the burger, it was not what I ordered. He said \"it's not happening\". He went from 10% off to 20% off. I just wanted to get out of there, they made me wait for my food and wait to talk to someone who was supposed to be reasonable but was only offensive and I'd been there way too long starving after a very long work week and hadn't had lunch that Friday because I was so busy. Two servers and the \"manager\" offered the excuse that they were busy. When I ponited out that half the tables were empty they replied there were a lot of take out orders. I said that still doesn't explain why I had to wait while my burger got cold. That was when each of them offered the manager/alleged burger flipper, although he lied about everything else so who knows why they make the manager flip burgers?",

The fries did not taste seasoned at all. They looked like they might be, but as far as we could tell it wasn't. Had to pile on the salt and pepper to give them any taste The burgers had no taste at all. Now for me not to finish a main dish is rare. It only ever happens when I've eaten right before.

Also, altogether it cost me over 13$, which is a lot. Way to fatty, the oil they used to fry the things tasted old and everything lacked salt.  One more thing: I hate when restaurants use plastic straws. Would be great if they could just bring the drink without a straw.",

It smelled of grease - the kind that sticks to your clothes and your hair until you take a shower and wash your clothes.  I had the black bean burger based on the servers rec and it was seriously disgusting.  It tasted like freezer burn nothingness.  I have been vegetarian for over a decade and have had many a variety of veggie burger.  This was seriously one of the worst.  I also had the minestrone soup which was also awful, thin, and pretty tasteless.  It was seriously one of the worst meals I have had in years.  The waitress was also extremely stressed out despite there being like 2 other tables, and made me feel very rushed and nervous and I didn't want to ask for anything extra or that would take her time.  Idk maybe if you order meat it's another story but I would never, ever, ever go to this place again.  Organic food most definitely doesn't have to taste like this!!!",

If not from nyc, it may be pricier than usual for a burger but for here it\u2019s the average price for a restaurant.

But my daughter's dish of Chicken Tenders was NOT SO good. It was extremely bland in taste and flavor. We had to use the honey mustard sauce for some flavor. The vanilla milk shake was great. Oh and one other details that was not appealing is that the onions for my burger were raw and just slapped in too if the burger \ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\ude02. My friend joined me with her son's and the little guy also had chicken tenders which he didn't like at all. However, despite, our experience. It's worth going for yourself. The first time I went my food was good. My Salmon Burger was ok this last time as well. The waitress were friendly and really enjoyed our children. So I'll give it another chance and order something else on the menu to see what that tastes like.",
