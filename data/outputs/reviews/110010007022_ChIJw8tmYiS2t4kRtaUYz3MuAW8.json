Honestly, the only issue is the pricing of the drinks to go. The strawberry basil drink was well made and tasty and has a good kick to it. The issue is thay they charge $7 for 1 serving or $30 for a container the size of a to-go soup container from most Chinese places. They say the large one is 2-4 servings. I think at the $20 or $25 mark it would make much more sense.",

        "caption": "Opened during the pandemic, Glover Park Grill is an example of a new way to fine dine. Located inside Glover Park Hotel, the restaurant is a bit more formal. However, to meet city regulations, they set up a large outdoor heated patio for their patrons. As you walk up, the lights strung along the patio give it more of a casual vibe. Then a hostess greets you starting service that is more formal. It's a tension that wouldn't work outside of the pandemic, but is refreshing during it for those who miss a step up from takeout and fast casual.  After dining at Glover Park Grill on a Saturday night with my house (my wife, toddler and housemate), I recommend making reservations. Here's why:  1) Safety: You reserve an outdoor table online to help with contact tracing. The moment you arrive, a masked hostess gives you hand sanitizer to use before sitting down. The patio is open-air, spacious and tables are spread apart appropriately. Every staff member is masked and keeps their distance as they take orders, bring food, etc. Menus are scanned using a smart phone and the bill is settled online to minimize touch.  2) Food: The menu is large without it being overwhelming. They have small plates, entrees that are accessible, entrees that are a bit more fancy, dessert and a generous kids menu. Each dish we ordered we enjoyed- Caesar salad, crunchy fried chicken sandwich, homemade cavatelli, pasta with tomato sauce (from the kids meal) and warm chocolate chip cookies. The standouts were the crunchy fried chicken sandwich (now on my top five best fried chicken sandwiches in the city thanks to the jalapeno honey) and chocolate chip cookies (one of the best in D.C.).  3)  Drinks: They have a diverse menu with cocktails, beer and a generous wine list. I ordered a glass of riesling for $11.  4) Atmosphere: For a pandemic outdoor space, they did a great job. The set up is simple, but still inviting, elegant and welcoming. In addition to tables, they have cushioned outdoor sofa for small groups. There are enough heaters throughout that you stay warm even though the patio has no walls. There is a roof to keep out rain.  5) Service: Staff strike a good balance of being attentive and friendly, but still professional and on point.  If you miss dining out, but want to do it safely, make a reservation at Glover Park Grill. If you have kids, there's a large playground at nearby Guy Mason Recreation Center that's a lot of fun.",

From the apps to the dinner. Tasteless was a recurring theme. 3 out of four plates at our table were beyond sub par. 1 plate was sent back all together (the veal. All the food on the plate was so cold, rubbery. Looked and tasted like veal out of a box.) The cost was laughable for the quality, it hurt. Sooooooo many great spots in DC. But not this one, which is a rare in this city. We consider ourselves foodies and I sincerely do not like to leave reviews like this. But man, please beware. Staff was fine.",

It was thinly sliced and seasoned perfectly. Did I mention how it melts in your mouth? Although I was torn between the chicken parmesan and bucatini I had the latter and it was devine. I finally get the meaning of al dente. When I tell you I did not want to stop eating, it was that good. I had plenty to take home. Try this dish and don't be afraid to ask the server for guidance.

They overcharge and underwhelm you with the quality of food and service. Not so with Casolare! I have eaten at this restaurant three times, and each time was impressed. The first was when my father came to visit and I booked him a room in the hotel (Klimpton Glover Park/Glover Park hotel).  We had breakfast together at Casolare and very much enjoyed the ambience, music, and service. My next visit was with friends and I was very impressed with the quality of the food I'd ordered (lamb with lentils, baby carrots, and brussel sprouts). Pricey though it was, our experience from start to finish was wonderful. The way it should be when you're catching up with old friends and don't want to worry about late or bland food, rude staff, etc.  Then, there's tonight. We started at the bar because the restaurant doesn't open until 5 o'clock. No problem. We had a leisurely glass of an Italian house wine and wound down. Eventually making our way to the restaurant, my friends and I were served by a very professional staff. Our waiter, Dominic, 2 or 3 or staff members who helped to clear away dishes, refill water glasses, etc, and the manager, who stopped by our table at the end of our meal.  I'm going on and on about this because 1) Our food (Margherita pizza, pizza of the day, and the grilled octopus) and dessert (Semifreddo, Cannoli, Pana Cotta) were delicious. 2) The service was impeccable. Our waiter, Dominic, was very familiar with the menu and gave excellent descriptions of each dish, as well as others on the menu. His recommendations were spot-on! 3) It's clear that everyone here really wants to do a good job and offer you an experience that is difficult to find (I think) in this area of time.  Casolare is well worth the price, given the quality of the food and staff. Oh, and whoever chooses the music has excellent taste. Give it a go!",
