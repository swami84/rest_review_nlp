My first experience at the Eagles Nest had more up than down. We sat along the windows; rotating views high above downtown were stellar. My Old Fashioned was well proportioned with a higher end ice cube. The signature Prime Rib had expected flavor. Brussel sprouts came across noticeably too salty, au jus lacked and had and oily mouthfeel, horseradish sauce and sides were fine. Selected appetizers were also on point. A couple of us at the table needed adjusting to the rotating area. After awhile, we acclimated. We had discussion about possibly taking a motion sickness tab prior to our next experience on the outer rim. The restaurant was out of our requested deserts on a 7:30p Saturday, which was surprising. On the other hand, what desert they did have was very flavorful. I asked for a regular coke at one point, but my refill ended on a not requested diet. Staff was pleasant, attentive, but not intrusive. High end dining is competitive downtown. Based on that, for the price, I must give three stars for some main course misses, desert unavailability, the refill misstep, and slight motion sickness. That said, I wouldn\u2019t want to be without The Eagles Nest In Indy. I feel good about trying again.",

But then we were running late so I elected to use valet for the first time in my life .. ka ching!  Anyway great service and good food. Tuna Poke .. large serving, not a lot of flavor, but I like raw tuna and I liked this. House Chopped salad .. good, no complaints, but not memorable. Seafood Chowder .. Greatest ever! Creamy, rich with lots of seafood, and a good size bowl.  It was the highlight of meal. Almond Butter Rice Noodles (had pork for lunch, so no more meat for me this day) .. First taste of noodles was bland, but then learned to mixed the surrounding veggies in with each bite of noodles cause that's where the flavor was. Very good vegetarian dish which didn't have me yern for meat. Like everyone else says ..great views here. Excellent service, good food, but I could eat lunch at Pho 36 for a month of great meals, and still not spend as much. Good thing with the Eagles Nest is that valet is half price if you eat here, so I didn't have to refinance my house.",

We eventually did convince the staff to let us sit all together (we were okay with facing the wall, you could still see outside!)  It took over an hour from when we sat down to when we received our drinks.  (I will say the \"oak & smoke\" was delicious, but tasted like it didn't have any alcohol)  Our meals took another hour to come out.  The meals were good sized portions, but our prime rib was mostly fat, the veggies were undercooked and the entire meal was cold.  When we finally did finish our meals, it felt like we were being rushed out.  When we got the check we were told we had to pay with the card  of the person who made the reservation.... Only one bill with an auto 20% tip.  Our waitress was kind, but a bit aloof and slowwwww.   The ambiance was bland besides the view.   There was barely any decor, no music playing and it felt like we were dining in the 1980s with the design.  All in all, NOT Worth the price.   Or the time.",

Ofcourse once we reached, and host immediately showed us to our table and wished me and also gave me a bday card! It's so good to still receive cards from unknowns or the restaurant you're celebrating at. The server quickly gave us paper photocopied menu sheets. I believe they have slightly changed the menu because I didn't see my order item in the pictures posted online.  We honestly have been hogging the entire trip in Indy, so we straight away went for the main course. I got asian buttered noodles, that was the only vegetarian option I could see and my hubby got something or pork. We were also offered a bread basket and there are two types of breads.. one is plain, soft roll and the other is like a dry fruit or raisin bread with butter. I enjoyed that while waiting for our dinner. We also ordered drinks, and they were quite good.They still don't provide coasters for drinks and had to ask for napkins to avoid wetting the table. They came quickly, well before the dinner...  The ambience is quite peaceful and romantic if you like to watch horizons and spend time with your family or loved one. Unfortunately, the JWMarriot hotel blocks the sunset, otherwise it would have been perfect! Once we received our lovely food, we were able to quietly enjoy it. I didn't have any sides, but my hubby got broccoli (sticks form) and mushrooms... Both of which he had to leave. I don't know if they were mentioned in the menu cards, otherwise we would have said, he doesn't like mushrooms. We had quite a portion size. I was almost going to leave a quarter of my food , because there was a good amount. But, we relaxed and ate slowly .. I believe we almost spent 1.5hrs eating and just relaxing - enjoying the view because we sat through an entire rotation.  This was my second time in this restaurant, last one was in 2013... So it felt quite good. In some places the rotation makes a small noise but you can barely hear it. Otherwise, it's quite enjoyable. I would nt recommend it for kids however. The place can be accessed from within Hyatt hotel.. the first elevator goes all the way to the top. I don't think there is WiFi for guests... If you're staying in the hotel, you can bill it to your room as well. In the end, I would give food 4.5stars, ambience 4stars and service 4.5 stars. Hope you enjoy your evening!",

After dinner at Harry & Izzy\u2019s and a little shopping downtown, we decided to visit the The Eagle\u2019s Nest for an after dinner drink.  It took almost 20 minutes for an elevator to pick us up to take us to the restaurant, because only 2 of the 4 elevators at the Hyatt go to the rooftop.  The hotel was not busy, so we\u2019re unsure what the delay in the elevators was.  I called the restaurant during our wait to be directed to a stairwell that we could take and the hostess told me there wasn\u2019t one.  I thought that was strange, but since the elevator finally arrived during that conversation, we went ahead.  Upon arrival, the hostess directed us to a table in the lounge area since we only wanted drinks and dessert.  After a 15 minute wait with no server, we were irritated and decided to leave.  The elevator issue was ongoing as nearly 10 other people were waiting for an elevator, so we went to an EXIT sign at a stairwell to walk down.  When we opened the door, the stairwell was lined with highchairs and other random restaurant items.  As we started walking down, the hostess yelled to us that we couldn\u2019t go that way because it didn\u2019t lead anywhere.  Clearly, that\u2019s not true...why would a downward stairwell lead nowhere?  They simply didn\u2019t want us to see that they use theirs as a catch-all storage unit.  We came back up and informed them that we were simply trying to leave after being ignored for 15 minutes AFTER trying to get to the restaurant for a long time.  We sat and waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for an elevator to pick us up.  After wasting 45 minutes of our night and terrible service and rude hostesses, we got drinks and dessert at the downstairs bar with a lovely bartender.  Would never return to the Eagle\u2019s Nest.",

        "caption": "So I haven't written a review in a while, but this experience warranted one. To start, the hostess left my wife and I standing for a while for her to find our reservation that I know I made and had confirmed beforehand. I spelled my name 4 times, and she still couldn't find it. It would make sense to stress the reservation if there were no available tables, but there were no occupied tables in sight of the entrance. I felt horrible because my wife was starting to worry. She was convinced I made this reservation last minute. We were seated at 7:05.  After we were seated, the waitress took a few minutes to get our drink order, then another 10 to bring it to our table. When she left the drinks, she said she would be back to take our order, but we waited again for about 5 minutes. As I am writing this, it is 40 minutes after we were seated, and we haven't had bread or appetizers.  At 7:50 we got our bread. Apparently we should've gotten that before the appetizers. However, we immidiately got our appetizers. So we have a table full of food, and the waiter asked me, \"Where am I supposed to put this?\" Honestly, we were just caught off guard that he was asking us that. As if I inconvenienced him.  We have been sitting this whole time in a two seat table that is made for short people, I think. My knees are just under the table, and I feel like I'm in a rollercoaster. I was practically in the fetal position the entire night.  Its 8:15 and we got our seafood chowder. It's good. We haven't had a bread refill, so I guess it's a one time deal.  8:30 we got our main course, and it tasted great! I wasnt expecting the portions to be so large, so that was a nice surprise. I requested to have a special dessert brought to us at the end, because it was our anniversary, but it never came. The hostess told me when I made my reservation a while back it depended on \"If the kitchen felt like doing it.\" I told her I would pay whatever I had to, just so i had a happy anniversary dessert.",

The booth seating was very uncomfortable, the cushions made you dip down and felt so small. We got there early waiting for a couple to arrive . I ordered the chocolate express martini and it came out half full. Booo! The waitress was not familiar with the menu. The menu item that I was excited to try was all gone. When you only have 6 entrees and you run out of one, that is frustrating.:/ I went into the bathroom, and the floor was sticky and around the sink was drenched. Yuck! My brother ordered the french onion soup and seafood chowder, both were excellent. We should've left right then! The fire alarm starts going off, they don't evacuate!!!! We are waiting to hear what is going on. The fire alarm goes off after 10 minutes, assured everything is fine. The fire alarm goes off 3 more times. :/ FOOD!!! They substituted halibut for the sea bass, not very good. The filet mignon was good. The prime rib was too salty. After some yummy dessert, creme brulee, we were ready to get out of there. Went into the bathroom again before leaving and it smells like puke! OMG! Get me out of here!! We go down the elevator to coat check, and it's gone! WTH! The men go back up to ask about the coats. They had moved them upstairs, but failed to tell us that this would happen when we checked them. Told the manager about how bad the experience was tonight, all he says is sorry about the coats. I will not go back!!",

When we first started coming years ago the menu never changed but when they got a new chef there was a huge jump in the quality and inventiveness of the menu. Seems like the new chef is gone because the menu is the same as last year and just didn't taste as good (oversalted or underseasoned).

I decided to order two appetizers instead of an entree and each were enough for two people. The Blue Crab Cakes were  large and did not disappoint on the volume of the lump crab. The remoulade was just enough to compliment the crab. The Burrata Caprese was a bit too soft and runny for me and I would have liked it a bit more firm. The beefsteak tomatoes were not too ripe and were a great compliment to the mozzarella. I requested the balsamic vinaigrette to be on the side and I was glad that I did as it was thick and sweet. The dish needed more basil but overall was enjoyable.",

They should take a little time to clean the windows, though, because they were a little dirty from hand prints and smears.  Otherwise it was a pretty awesome view and good food!  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  Not the biggest food selection on the menu.  They have a pretty good drink menu, though.  Didn't take too long to get our food (probably 45 minutes or so) and we had an appetizer (the hummus which was awesome with the warm, grilled pita bread).",

The server started by asking us what we \"wanted to drink\".. It felt like a diner. No suggestions, no menu review, just not what i would expect. My husband steak was undercooked, but the server never touched back so he got frustrated and just ate it. The only good thing was the drinks. This place needs a menu makeover and the staff need training. She didnt even tell him Happy Birthday after I put it in the reservation and said Happy Birthday to him right infront of her.  The manager walked past our table but didnt stop. As we left he was sitting at the host stand. Im not suprised at the lack luster service, after seeing him sitting there. He didnt even make eye contact or thank us as we waited on elevator... he just looked at the ceiling.  I served tables for 10 years and I couldnt believe how unimpressive this place was. They need to do something.. unless that are happy with 1 time guests. My coworker said the nest had went down hill..and she wasnt kiddn  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",

BE ALERT and look at your bill before paying! It was just two of us and even though there is still a place for gratuity, 20% had already been added to the bill! One of our least  favorite Devour Indy experiences.",

        "caption": "This weekend was our first time dining here. What we learned from our experience was that apparently people come for the rooftop view (which indeed is nice) and not for the service or the food. We had a 6 p.m. dinner reservation, and told our server that we had to be out by 7:30 because we had tickets to an 8 p.m. show; she assured us that that would be no problem! But it took almost an hour after ordering for our food to arrive, and also a full hour to be offered any refill at all on my iced tea. For a restaurant costing us $100/couple to eat, we received very little attention, and at no time did our server or anyone else apologize for the delays or even stop by to say \"Your food will be coming soon.\" My signature-dish Prime Rib was nearly half fat, and came with three grilled brussels sprouts cut in half and some admittedly excellent garlic mashed potatoes. After our food had finally come, the waitress didn't collect our credit cards for payment until 7:50 (and remember she'd originally said we could be out by 7:30)! Consequently our party almost missed the beginning of the show, and made it only because the theatre was close enough to rush there on foot.  Note: The nut/raisin bread (one of two options in the bread basket) was quite good, and the man whose job it was to refill our water glasses was excellent about reappearing to top them off as needed, which we appreciated.  Consensus: If you want to go mainly for the city view, do so -- but definitely not on a day when you need to be anywhere afterward. And if you're thinking of going mainly so that you can try the Signature Prime Rib, I recommend you eat somewhere nearer the ground, where you're likely to get a better prime rib and to receive it sooner.",

We arrived at 6 with a reservation and informed our server that we had a hard exit time, as we had to pick up our theater tickets by 7:30. We had plenty of time! but that's a common dining courtesy, and this would normally be when a server would inform diners of any potential recommendations (\"this one comes out really fast, but you might not want to go with this other dish as it takes a bit longer\") but ours just said sure, thanks for letting them know.  Over an hour later our food had not arrived. Bread was delivered, but we had to flag someone down for additional drinks and butter. We were starting to get nervous about our tickets, which would be released to general sale if not picked up. When our dinners finally came, about 7:15, one of our party bolted through her meal and then rushed out to collect tickets.  The rest of us ate (at a slightly less-ridiculous pace) our mediocre food. I'd ordered my steak medium rare, and it came medium well -- but no way was I going to ask for a replacement and miss eating entirely. My green vegetables were overcooked and limp. The horseradish potatoes were tasty, but that's a lot of money to get good potatoes. (My sister ordered the prime rib, which came more than half fat and with few vegetables. After a $60 meal she got a snack at the theater because she was hungry. That's not right. She's a petite actress who eats reasonable portions.)  Now that we'd hit our hard exit time, we asked for checks. We could watch our server moving around and not going to print them. By 7:48, they still hadn't come. I pulled cash out to leave on the table and stood to go, putting on my jacket, and then she came to say checks were coming. My husband told me to go ahead and he'd pay. At 7:51 I left the restaurant, with them still waiting to pay. They did make the 8:00 show, only because the show started a few minutes late.  I get that stuff happens in a kitchen and I'm pretty flexible -- but not once did anyone stop by the table to say things were moving a bit slow, I'll check on your order, can I get you a fresh water while you wait? Not once was there the slightest acknowledgment that we'd waited an hour for food and had definitely missed our exit time. The restaurant wasn't over-busy, it didn't have the look of missing staff that day, they just didn't check in or care.  In a city known for steakhouses, there are much better options for the same price range.",

Details: We were seated at 6PM, and informed our server that we were concerned about time, as we had to pick up our theatre tickets (across the street at IRT) at will call by 7:30. She told us that wouldn't be a problem. We ordered and waited. And waited. And waited. At 7:15, when we once again expressed concern about the time, our server told us our food would be right out. It was actually put on the table at 7:21, over an hour after we'd ordered. Two of the steaks weren't cooked to the right temperature, but we didn't have time for the kitchen to fix it, as by this time we were already late. One member of our party scarfed down her meal in under 5 minutes and ran to the theatre to make sure our tickets weren't resold; the rest of us chewed quickly and immediately asked for our checks, since the play began at 8PM.  We didn't receive the checks until 7:51 -- more than 20 minutes past the time we'd told our server we had to be at the theatre -- and then had to wait on credit cards to be run, with the result that even with immediate elevator service and running to IRT, the curtain chimes were ringing before we made it to our theatre seats. At no time during the entire evening did anyone at the restaurant tell us the kitchen was running behind, or that they were unusually busy, or even apologize for the delay that almost cost us our tickets.  As for the food, it was... okay. Perfectly edible, but not as good as you'd find at other local landmarks (St. Elmo, et al.), and not worth the premium price. My prime rib was more than 60% solid fat, and the vegetable servings were small enough that I actually left the restaurant STILL HUNGRY and had to get a snack at the theatre. I should not pay $60 for a meal and leave hungry!  I enjoyed the aerial view of the city, but I will not bother eating here again. There are too many good restaurants in Indy to waste time and money on a mediocre experience like this one.",

My wife ordered a surprise cake for me couple of days before our anniversary date. But on our dinner night, after we arrived at the restaurant they suddenly told us that their chef left early and they couldn\u2019t prepared our surprise cake!!!! I have no freaking idea why they didn\u2019t inform us earlier! In that case we could go to some other location. Such a poor display of hospitality and mangement. It was just spoiled our anniversary dinner. The food was pretty average. Nothing special at all. The only good thing about this place was the location of the restaurant and it's 360 degree revolving floor. I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone for any special / personal event in future.",

Our total came to $114.00 due to the waitress comping our dessert because it was our Wedding Anniversay. If you are a drinker, I would imagine your bill to be much higher.  The view of the Indianapolis skyline was wonderful and since the Eagles Nest is a revolving restaurant the view was always changing. The wait staff was very professional and polite. Christine was our waitress and she took very good care of us from start to finish. I would highly recommend the restaurant for special occasions or if you just want to dine while watching the Indy skyline.",

He got to meet the chef and the chef took him back to the kitchen to help cook the appetizer. He was speechless.  A moment he will never forget. Chef Dakota was truly excited to work with my son for this experience.  The food was amazing and my son was able to try about 8 new foods which he loved them all.  He got to witness great service thanks to Trace who was an outstanding server and went well above expectations even for a place of this level.  Thank to to the staff of the Eagles Nest, trace, and Chef Dakota.",

Lightly spicy, but with a citrus aftertaste that's pretty unique, for me anyway. I believe they were $18, with the up charge. I'd guess you get about ten oz of total liquid, give or take. If there was one oz of vodka in it, I'll eat my hat. Shrimp cocktail app. $16 for 4 fairly large shrimp in a martini glass. Now let me say I've never ordered this before, and I never order shrimp cocktail in downtown Indy bc it seems as tho there's a competition among restaurants to see who can burn the biggest hole into your sinuses with horseradish. But, I thought I'd give it a shot and it's no different. Five seconds of pain per each bite, AND it comes with an extra side of horseradish! Smdh They took duck off the menu, another reason I would go bc it's amazing. So I went with my other desire...16 oz Prime Rib, medium rare. It comes with their mashed potatoes, which have always been, and still are amazing. The other side is caramelized brussel sprouts which I didn't think I'd like so I asked to substitute for a truffle mac and cheese. \"Sorry, no substitutions but I can 'add' a side of mac\". Well duh...I'm fully aware you can add a side for $8. Oh just go ahead and it. Don't quote me but I believe the 16 oz Prime is $36, with the two sides. Now I've worked in the restaurant business for many years and I worked for a restaurant that used the absolute best grade beef ONLY for their prime rib. It was a thing of beauty and every piece of a med rare slice could almost be eaten with a spoon. To cut costs as years went by, they downgraded. Though it was still 'good' it wasn't excellent. Eagle's Nest is no exception. Although the rosemary based herb crust is still to die for, the meat itself is just 'good' not excellent. Again, the mashed potatoes are still great, and to my shock, the brussel sprouts were caramelized in a sort of bacon 'grease' and were quite good. Which was a good thing bc the mac and cheese, with its spiral pasta baked in an oversized ceramic bowl, left much to be desired. Since the last time I went, they've also changed the bread they bring out, but it was very very good. The server we had, seemed very stiff and robotic. If she said the word 'absolutely' one more time, I'd have screamed. And maybe they've started a new thing, but we only saw her one more time following her taking our order, and that was to ask about dessert, which I declined, and then immediately giving the bill. There were 'server assistants' that did absolutely everything else. Appetizer, bread, meals, water refills, clearing of plates, even inquiring about the enjoyment of the meal, never her. So look, I'm not rich. I come here, at the most, twice a year. I've learned to just roll with whatever bc I go to take my girlfriend to watch the sunset and then watch the city light up. It's truly beautiful each and every time. But what I will also say, ten years ago, more or less, I'd say I actually went for the food and that's simply no longer the case. I spent, with tip, $170 for the two of us. I sadly must say I am starting to rethink my trips here bc of that amount. It's becoming, simply, not worth it. If you're wanting incredible, and I mean INCREDIBLE foods, and possibly for the same amount, if not less, and all you can eat, head to Fogo da Chao which is my all time favorite restaurant in Indy for food. For atmosphere, along with crazy good drinks and food, Ricks Boatyard Cafe on the westside of Indy.",

The rotating section gives you a full 360 view every hour and a half. The food, with its very tiny selection, was good but not what I expected from a $50 per person not including drinks, appetizers, or dessert restaurant. I have had better food at Applebee\u2019s for a quarter of the cost. The service was not what I expected either, I did not get a prim and proper vibe from the staff and from the restaurant. Prim and proper is what I expect from a restaurant where your average bill will be over $100 for two people. From other reviews I have read the main attractions are the drinks and the views. If you don\u2019t mind the cost and want a great experience I definitely recommend visiting, but I don\u2019t plan on coming back anytime soon.",

We only stopped for drinks and dessert so I cannot speak to the food. However, the Bartender, Aaron, was very professional and friendly and even brought out a sample of Buffalo Trace that is made specifically for Hyatt hotels. The cheesecake I ordered was delicious. Overall the cost was lower than I was expecting for as nice of a restaurant that the Eagle's Nest is. It's a can't miss experience.",
