Check in on other food app to get a free pineapple tea, this stuff is sweet but so good.  2. Garlic shrimp: honesty I love sauce, and to me this is lacking that  3.

I didn't get to ask him if he was Sam or not. Anyway he recommended I try the spicy preparation of whatever protein I ordered because he guessed correctly that I enjoy heat. I actually wanted both the shrimp AND the steak but didn't want to do two different entrees! They don't do combos but he told me that for $27 I could get the two proteins but with just one scoop of rice, potato salad and the greens. I decided to skip the rice and got extra greens with the spicy steak and garlic shrimp. I have to admit that it was a lot of food and ate it again twice after that! The steak was DELICIOUS! It wasn't spicy hot but was flavoured well, it was also exquisitely tender. I was very surprised that it was tender coz most places I've eaten it like this it's been chewy! The shrimp was good but needed some salt! I wish they had put the salad on the side instead of under the steak because it became really oily! The potato salad complemented everything really well!!! Definitely give this place a chance! Btw they have water at the back, with wee little cups. I had to get up to check on it because I couldn't see it from where I was sitting! That's also where you can get extra condiments",

There are many garlic shrimp shops in Hawaii, but if you are on the Waikiki side, this is a great place! You can take out, but there is space to eat though it is narrow, so it is good to sit down and eat slowly.

The grandpa who was at the counter was also very friendly and enjoyable conversations. Ahipoke rice cake is seasoned with ginger, garlic and soy sauce that Japanese people like, and slices of onion make the taste stand out. It was good to enjoy a taste similar to Japan in Hawaii, where there are many meat dishes and junk food. Ice tea with pineapple was not too sweet and it was easy to drink because it moisturizes the throat. Next time I came to Hawaii, I wanted to eat other flavored rice cakes.

If you use Yelp don\u2019t forget to check in and redeem the check in special.  [BYOB] While they don\u2019t sell soda this restaurant isn\u2019t limited to only BYOB of alcohol. Plus with an ABC Store just couple of doors down this worked out great and I was able to get my caffeine fix.  [FOOD] I L-O-V-E-D the garlic shrimp. Really liked that it was already shelled. Hate when the shell is still on and then after you peal it that you lose most of the flavor because it was on the shell. You won\u2019t have that problem here. Also they use enough garlic that you can actually taste the garlic, which is great because I love garlic.  [SERVICE] Loved the service. The female worker running the register and taking orders at the front was very friendly (even to locals!!). She did a great explaining the menu to us and the difference between the different sauce options for the steak. The older male worker was able to flow between English and Japanese speaking. He did a great job communicating with customers about the wait time for their orders and apologizing when it got slammed and took a while for the orders to come out.",

It's not a completely fair comparison as Sam's shrimp comes unshelled and are bigger and more temder and plump.  Steak was tender and cooked to medium rare. Poke tasted of ginger. We appreciated the spinach on the side. Water is free in the back and theres a bathroom.  If you enjoy your seafood well done, I think it would be too challenging as this was just cooked but I love my seafood this way as it is more common in Asian cooking.  The manager who was serving the food was as nice as I've had anywhere. Sam's has been around for 6 years and he, the manager, has been there for 5. He works for his friend,  Sam and he treats the place like his own, with great respect. The lady taking the order was also very casual, upbeat and kind. I liked her too.  The place sits on a sliver of land cut between two buildings, brightly painted in red, white and blue.  They are opening a second location within a hotel soon.  It wasn't a ton of food as we are avoiding eating too many carbs but I definitely liked what we ate (potato salad was decent) and were thankful we got a parking spot in front... just after 6pm in this high traffic area of Waikiki.  Come if you can manage it. Most of the customers are young Japanese families with super cute little kids. We loved watching the cute kids.",

Looked at the menu and decided to stop by the next day for lunch and I am so glad I did. Their shrimp plate is amazingly delicious. The plate comes with a good portion of shrimp with steamed rice and macaroni salad. In my opinion, this place is better than Giovanni's Shrimp Truck and without the long drive to North Shore. Highly recommend Sam's Kitchen.",

Garlic shrimp was delicious according to reputation. If you want to eat shrimp in Waikiki, I think this is good. I do not sell alcohol. Instead, it's OK to buy at the next ABC store.  The owner's uncle is a very good person.

We went for an early dinner and waited about 10 minutes for our order. You have your option of chicken, beef, shrimp and fish. We ordered the garlic chicken plate with rice for $9. The flavour of the chicken was one of the best we had on Waikiki and would definitely go back. You are paying for the quality of the meat and flavour. The size is about half your usual lunch plate and doesn't include macaroni salad. If you are hungry, you will likely need to have two orders. I would return to Sam's Kitchen again, but this place should really be ranked $$ because of the size of the orders. Kudos for the BYOB option.",

From the person who likes to try it to the individual that dares to eat everything. The taste took a little getting use but overall I think the food was good. And customer service was great; we were greeted before we even entered and while we waited in line the manager continued to check on us. We had a little wait before we ordered but it wasn\u2019t so long to deter us. One thing I definitely want to mention is seating. There aren\u2019t a lot of tables there so seating goes fast. We arrived in the evening/night (maybe around 6pm-8pm) and we waited for a table to clear to have a \u201csit and eat\u201d experience. Overall this location is a go-to spot in Honolulu for anyone visiting Hawaii. Definitely try something at Sam\u2019s Kitchen.",
