Around 7:28PM, I called the restaurant and was told the order would be delivered in 5-10 minutes. Around 7:45PM, I called back and was told the order would not be coming and I would receive a full refund. I was upset, but moved on and decided to make dinner instead. 2 hours and 30 minutes after I placed the order and 45 minutes after being told my food wouldn't arrive, some random person dropped off the order on my porch. Even though the night staff assured me I would be getting a refund since my food wasn't coming, the manager stated I was no longer eligible because the food eventually arrived (after I had made and eaten dinner). He offered a 50% refund. A 50% refund on an order that I was told was cancelled. A 50% refund for cold, stale food after I already went through the trouble of making dinner. I did not want the food and offered to return it to the restaurant, but the manager would not accept it. They can have the cold, disgusting looking food back. I want my money.",

They don\u2019t have any pies out on display, they won\u2019t serve you slices if it\u2019s within an hour or so of closing (perhaps work on your business if demand is so low that you won\u2019t make a new pie), and at this location, the restaurant always smells like someone diarrheaed in the bathroom and the AC is blowing it everywhere. I\u2019ve brought it up multiple times, but they tell me it doesn\u2019t smell. I apologize for not spending enough time in there to get acclimated, Racasmellis.  I suggest you guys take a trip to New York to study what makes their pizza the best in the world and try to emulate it.",

Beyond  frustrated with the Manager (Dan), who was literally loud enough with his negative comments towards false impressions of the Military force.  All his comments was heard in the lobby with other patrons waiting on their pizza.  I, myself was the one who apparently sparked his tantrum when I inquired about a military discount, which could've been resolved with a simple comment, \"sorry, we dont offer military discount\".  Sounds simple right? Nope, not enough for this man who wanted to express his opinion loud for me to hear in front lobby.  Let me put this into perspective....the Manager, was in the back preparing my pizza...at this point who knows what was done to my pizza!!!!!  Paid for 2 pizzas, but not eating any from this guy was talking negatively and preparing my pizza at the same time!  Simply put, this anti-military, disgruntled, and unprofessional MANAGER, does not need to be a manager of any establishment.  When I advised the cashier to inform Dan, he had not a clue on what he was talking about and if he wanted a free lesson on the military, I would be happy to educate him so.  His employees were embrassed and non-stop were apologetic about the incident.  \"99% of US never saw combat\", \"we get paid handsomely\", \"we get a 40K bonus after 4 years\"....REALLY????  WHAT MILITARY IS THIS GUY REFERING TO.  NEVER WILL GO TO THIS PLACE OR REFER ANYONE HERE.",

        "caption": "Yesterday, while enjoying a beer at Itap next to Racanelli's, we decided to order a pizza online and pick it up when we were finished. We ordered the Sicilian at 4:08pm (I can forward you the e-mail conf.,), gave it an hour as stated on the menu. I (Amber) went in to pick up the pizza after an hour had passed. I gave the girl at the counter my name and she proceeded to print out a ton of things from the receipt printer. My receipt was then e-mailed to me at that time. After all the things printed out she told me it would be a few minutes for the pizza.  Meanwhile, as she is telling me this, another FEMALE employee is exiting the MENS restroom, with a man clearly still in the restroom.(he never exited in the time I was there) I have a pretty clear view of this from the counter. (might want to check your cameras if you have them). Pretty gross given there isn't really an excuse for a female employee to be in the mens restroom with a man when there are male employees working.  So, as I continue to wait a few minutes for my pizza, the male employee comes from the back and asks me if I am waiting for the Sicilian. I say yes, and he then informs me it will be a while. I ask how long and he tells me 25 minutes. Seriously? I have already waited an hour and was just told it would be a few minutes. I walk out to let my boyfriend know we should probably just order more beer because it is going to be another 25 minutes. Doesn't really make sense to have to wait 90 minutes for a pizza.  My boyfriend (Josh) then goes inside and asks about the wait and he was told the same thing. He told them he didn't want the pizza. The female employee who was in the mens restroom walked into the back laughing. A male employee then came out and told him the pizza was in the oven. Josh told him he didn't want it, and the employee just kept repeating that the pizza was already in the oven. He told them he placed the order at 4:08pm and was told that they go by \"their time\" Josh's response was that he goes by actual time. Josh then had to argue to get his money back, and was asked why he couldn't just wait for the pizza. Are you kidding me? After finally getting his money back he was told for future reference the Sicilian takes an hour. HELLO GENIUSES... IT HAD BEEN AN HOUR! Perhaps if someone hadn't been in the mens room and doing their job, the pizza would have been on time? Just a thought.",

I had a great experience the pizza was delicious and the customer service was awesome the GM came out to our table and talked about the world cup with us and also interacted with my children he and his staff were very friendly and understanding of my children's restlessness and playfulness even when my daughter spilled soda all over the bathroom they were very quick to clean up the mess and ask if we needed anything else. We are going back to St Louis at the end of July and we will be eating here again",

Just hung up with a young lady who was having a conversation with a pal about how 'that girl looks in that picture' while taking my order (?? who does that?), then hung up on me. After trying to call back and inform the manager of the rude staff, I was told the Manager on Duty was too busy to take a call. The best part is when I insisted, the person who answered put me on hold, then turned around and picked up the phone acting like the Manager, I asked why he said the manager was busy if he was in fact the manager, and he responded with \"i just had things to do\"... I suppose Racanelli's staff thinks their customers are idiots. If you can deal with this type of customer service you might get a good slice of pizza. Not worth it to me.",

That aside, the flavor was decent, and the authentic hand tossed crust was nice - has a brick oven taste almost. More expensive than a comparable pizza from the chain stores. Not great pizza, but good. Don't let it get cold, though...  I did enjoy the garlic knots - very flavorful, but for the price I expected more.  Place was clean, though as another person mentioned, empty. Strange for a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  I would go back, but there is definitely better out there.",
