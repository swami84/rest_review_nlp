        "caption": "Ordered a cornucopia of selections to go from here for a pasta feast in one night.  Right off the bat, the focaccia and ricotta & honey knocked me clean out of my Bombas socks. The focaccia isn't as oily or airy as other focaccia I've had, but the elation of the softness, heartiness and salty flavor of this thick focaccia is quite pleasing. I was going to heat it up (as the pasta had to travel a far way home) but after one bite I couldn't in good conscience take the time it would require.  On first bite some folks thought the ricotta was burrata because of its pillowy, smooth texture. The combo of that cream with the sweetness of the honey and the big, tender focaccia was honestly my favorite part of the meal.  As a carnivore naturally I ordered the gnocchi with sausage sauce, which could've benefitted from a reheat I think. The gnocchi wasn't as soft as my tongue prefers, but the custom shape was a little chunk of art in each bite.  The spaghetti had a complex, deep umami flavor that was delightfully unexpected. The acidity of tomatoes often punches through during a plate of spaghetti, but it was napping quietly during this dish to our pleasant delight.  Pork ragu tagliatelle was like putting your favorite warm cardigan on while slurping a glass of wine from a bottle you swiped from your rich parent's secret wine cellar. It knew exactly what it was doing and delivered.  The fennel salad delivered a quenching punch of citrus and your nose picked up the garlic before the fork hit your mouth. It was hard not to get a spoon and rescue all the dressing once the salad was gone.",

Like, so insane that after I scarfed down my first helping, I first complemented the chef and then politely ordered a second helping. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc The servings were fair, perfect. They come in little black rectangular containers with clear tops.

Prices vary but reasonable. \u2022 the lady working the register was the sweetest and warmest. Kind, patient and helpful from her first word to the order being brought out to me personally. \u2022 I was allowed to wait for my order inside with my \ud83d\ude37 on of course. I watched the young lady cut freshly made pasta in the window while jamming to their bomb music. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc \u2022 I was gifted a free dessert for confusion of info on one of the search sites, and it was yummy as well!

For a place that seems to pride itself on ingredients and knowing their food, both times we went the person didn't know what it was to be vegan. This was after I had messaged them confirming they had options beforehand. Even worse, they told us the Panzanella was vegan and the 2nd time we went they said it wasn't. I'm fine with places that don't offer vegan options, but to not even know what it is or be able to answer basic questions about ingredients and allergens seems absurd to me for a place like this.  I truly do love the atmosphere and their live music. It's a shame they aren't suited for those of us with different diets",

This gem of a place in Chicago does just that. Making fresh pasta daily using quality imported semolina flour from Italy, fresh organic eggs from a local farm up in Wisconsin and water. That\u2019s all the ingredients you need and the results are fantastic! In my previous post, I made stop at Tortello just to check out their production. I\u2019m a skeptic like that. I\u2019ve had so many pasta dishes in the US. Many will boast of theirs being authentic but often times I leave disappointed in their quality and in execution. So before trying it out, I decided to make an inspection first. When I walked in, I met  the owner Dario Nonni who greeted me at the door and we had a brief conversation about his place. From what I saw, I was impressed so I decided to come back another day to give this place a try.  Second time around, we went into throw down and ordered the following: Focaccia w/ ricotta & honey, fennel, celery & orange salad, tortelli, cacio e pepe and Zucchini \u201cpasta\u201d w/ grass-fed beef rag\u00fa. All the pastas were excellent. Their tortelli  One dish to point out: their cacio e pepe was one of the closest I had outside of Rome and I love how they kept it simple (good bucatini style pasta, imported aged pecorino cheese and fresh pepper) - just like how that dish is suppose to be. Complimenti Dario!  For dessert we got their classic tiramisu. This is the one that I anticipated the most. If you know the history of this dessert, it originated from a town called Treviso, about 30km north of Venezia. Since Dario is from Venice, I expected him to keep the recipe as close to the traditional one as possible. Thankfully he did. Aside from couple of very minor critiques, I can say that their tiramisu is probably the best one I\u2019ve had in Chicago and made/taste the way how Tiramisu is suppose to be! Bravo Cuoco!  I wanted to talk and thank Dario & Jill in person after this wonderful experience. Unfortunately they were not in that day but I was more impressed because of their absence because their staff provided excellent service and the chef also trained his staff to keep the dishes consistent which I found out recently from my other visits to restaurants that it is not an easy task to do. Because of this, Tortello Pasta gets my #kkapproved hashtag. Auguri Tortello e ci vediamo alla prossima!  Disclaimer: I do not have any experience in food & restaurant industry nor have any training in culinary school. My only credential is that I know lot of chefs and I may have had more pasta / Italian food (both locally and all across Italy) than your average Italian.",

The signature dish, The Tortelli, is out of this world. You can taste the effort that was put into the dough, the filling, the sauce, it is meant to be savored. This was crafted people, think about the time that goes into that plate before you get it, you cannot get an experience like this anywhere in Chicago. I have dreams about it.  Finallly, the Tiramisu is delicious and a perfect portion to finish it off. What can I say...can't wait to get out of this quarantine.

The host made me feel so welcome, and I was thrilled with the food. The spaghetti is literally insane -- stracciatella and bas on top of fresh pasta??? I've been thinking about it ever since.  I'm honestly surprised this place doesn't have a line out the door.  The only thing I would wish for is that they jarred their pasta sauces and provided paper boxes for their pastas. I didn't buy the (delicious) pasta sauce they sell because it's in paper cups, even though I really wanted to. That could easily spill in my bag, even if I wrap it. I also bought their tortelli and it stuck together in the paper bag they gave me. I came home with about half of it ripped, very sad.  Not their fault, just wanted to share a few opportunities for improvement. I'd still return at every opportunity. The food and service is amazing.",

But last night we took Tortello\u2019s pasta making class and were blown away by the fun experience. Their head pasta maker, Alex, took us through a passionate short history of pasta, then ably walked us through a hands on experience of making dough, followed by four different pasta shapes. Afterwards, we enjoyed a full dinner of salads, pastas and desserts. But wait, there\u2019s more! Each of us left with a couple bags of the dough and pastas we made. Enough for many more meals. I highly recommend taking the class, especially with a group of friends.",

The Chiusoni was pretty flavorful; I was a fan of the pasta itself, and the sausage was tender and appropriately salty - a pretty hearty dish. Only downside was that the pasta itself was just a touch undercooked, in my opinion. The focaccia was decent, nothing crazy special, and the riccota and honey was a nice, if not unique touch! What really killed it for me was the super high price and TINY portion. I don't mind the counter-serve style, and minimal atmosphere, but the amount of pasta on the plate was smaller than my hand... I made the joke to my friends that we should schlep over to Popeye's after for a 4-piece. The combination of quite-high price, decent pasta, and teeny serving brings this joint down a bit from an ace rating.",

The staff is extremely helpful and attentive for a casual place.  They walked us all through the different menu items and explained the origins of the dishes.  We went with the tortelli, chuisoni, and bucatini.  All were excellent with the tortelli being my favorite.  It\u2019s hard to find excellent fresh pasta and this place nails it.

        "caption": "My husband and I came here looking forward to trying the pasta. The options on the menu aren't many but we tried two different dishes and enjoyed both of them. The texture of the pasta reminded me much more of dried pasta than fresh pasta, as fresh pasta is usually softer and the pasta in the dishes was rather chewy. You place your order at the register, pay, tip, and then sit down. We sat down in a nirmal fashion, across from each other at a table, until we realized that the HVAC was leaking on all of the seats. There were no notes deterring anyone from sitting over there so I let management know, but they were already well aware, just didn't think it necessary to tell any guests, or clean up the dripping water, or try to do anything to stop the dripping-- the owner just shrugged and said that there was nothing they could do. We ate our food after waiting longer than I thought was reasonable considering the number of people in the restaurant, and sat back to await the granitas I had ordered. Again, after waiting longer than we should have a server came to our table to set one orange granita down and said we only had one orange left so here's a chocolate one to replace the other one. We were not asked if we wanted a replacement, we were not offered any options, they just assumed that we would want the half-frozen chocolate granita to replace the orange one I had already paid for. I tried a little and noticed it had a strong coffee taste--this was at 9pm, not the time one would generally be drinking coffee--and neither I nor my husband drink coffee anyway and I can't have caffeine due to health concerns, so that one was left mostly untouched. As we were about to leave I asked if there was coffee in the one they decided to substitute without asking us about it, and another worker confirmed that there was. I suggested to her that something like that should be mentioned before serving it to someone, especially when they didn't order it. So even though we liked the pasta well enough, the general failure in customer service would prevent us from returning to spend that much money again.",

I \u2018ve had glasses of wine and prosseco bigger than 5oz, it\u2019s the restaurant discretion what they want to serve to the customers. Said that, I totally come back for the yummy pasta and I would rather buy one of your bottles of wine over a single small glass of prosseco.",

My fianc\u00e9e and I dined this evening and split three pasta dishes (we couldn\u2019t narrow our selection to two!). We had the tortelli (which is filled with a light, yet creamy burrata, topped with a delicate brown butter sauce, and is balanced by a crunch of crispy sage and toasted hazelnuts), orecchiette (which is tossed in a peppery rapini pesto and breadcrumbs for great textural balance), and lobster bucatini (with super fresh tomatoes that brought a lovely brightness to the dish).  Most notably, the pasta was cooked to a PERFECT al dente, yielding an actual bite that was firm, allowing the pasta to hold its shape, promoting true tasting of the richness of the fresh pasta, and perfectly balancing the texture with the additional components of each dish. There is nothing worse than mushy over cooked pasta. That certainly is NOT the experience here, as Tortello perfected each plate!  The service and atmosphere of Tortello are also wonderful. The owner greeted us as we walked in, spoke to all of the guests at their tables, and showed genuine consideration for each diner and their experience. His passion was obvious and he made my fianc\u00e9e and I feel welcome right away. There was a mix of families with young children and young and old couples, sitting inside and also dining outside on the patio. While we dined, we noticed the sfoglina making pasta by hand was catching the attention of dozens of passerby on the street. We don\u2019t blame them as we also took the time to sit and watch her!  What a wonderful experience. Tortello has two new regulars. Our only qualm was that we hadn\u2019t visited sooner!",

Every dish (my table tried 3) were amazing, but the Tortello di Burrata was one of the best bites of food you\u2019ll find anywhere.  It was one of those bites where my wife and I looked at each other with eyes wide open.  We took our three young boys there too and it was extremely family friendly.   We literally may come back just for that Tortello dish.  Wow!  (SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT TOO! The owner greeted us at the door)",
