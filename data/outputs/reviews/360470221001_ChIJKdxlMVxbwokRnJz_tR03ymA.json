LA is all about Thai, Armenian and Latin food so I had to check it out.  First of all, the atmosphere... Really cozy, warm and eccentric. I wish they didn't light Sandalwood scented candles on the tables, because I couldn't truly enjoy the smells of the spices filling the room.  The chef/busboy/waiter strip show was really entertaining. I imagine you would not find anything like this in the area. His yellow banana print boxers help distract you from the sweat dripping off his brow, onto the food.  The food was unbelievable. I've never seen a chef use fresh, local ingredients in such new and exciting ways as Chef Julius. The plating was impeccable, with every bit of food accenting the last. They clearly put a lot of thought into the construction of their dishes, and I have to commend them on their success.  In all, this experience was unforgettable. I will probably never be back, but I will tell everyone about it and I imagine there will be a long successful road for the owners of this establishment.",

She was especially excited, as Hurlbut's description of the Gargantuan Fettuccine Alfredo with Spilled Bacon sounded spectacular, if not a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Now, the food was breathtaking\u2014I might even use the word euphoric. And the space is quaint, intimate, and rustic. It was obvious that the owners put a great deal of attention into this restaurant. But the service was peculiar.  There was only one employee on staff, acting as the ma\u00eetre d, server, chef and busboy. I understand it is a small space, and a relatively new restaurant, but this man was soaked with sweat from running about. He was dressed impeccably when we first arrived in the restaurant, but he continued taking more and more clothes off as he scurried about. As another reviewer stated he was wearing only boxers, glasses and an apron by the time he arrived with our starters. He looked like a moist honey baked ham that had been dropped into a pile of discarded dog fur. Another customer said it enhanced their dining experience, having whet their palate in between dishes, so I can't complain too much.  Otherwise, the experience was quite wonderful. I was confused when I asked for a post-dinner mint, as this man bent over and spoke from his buttocks as if he was Ace Ventura,  but again, I suppose this makes for a quirky dining experience. I can see why people keep coming back for more.",
