About halfway through my loaded nacho fries, which I highly recommend, I find a three inch curly hair wrapped around the ends of some fries, coated in cheese. After a minute of contemplation, I no longer nger tad a desire to finish the food, and decided to go tell the cashier about the issue. When I got to the Counter and began to tell the older Hispanic woman what I found, she immediately went of the defense, saying only the two men at the grill made fries, and they had very short hair, of course, I responded that I have short hair too. I only had about 10-15 fries left on the plate, and requested if they could make a small portion for me, because I'd really like to get what I paid for. The cashier stared at me with unnecessary hostility and continued to claim there is no way the hair came from any of her staff. I responded simply that I didn't know where the hair came from, but I know it wasn't mine, and it was found near the bottom of the pile of cheesy, bacon, nacho fries. \"What do you want me to do about it?\" I was suddenly asked with an attitude I had yet to ever receive from someone working in food service, and I've done it myself for many years, in a few different restaurants, and \"you already ate most of it.\" I again explained that I would like a small portion, the same as what I had left on the plate, to eat, no more no less, just what I paid for. The cashier then snatched the plate with the hair from me and threw it, not dropped, literally threw the container in the trash and told one of the men at the grill to make me a new one. In the end I did get what I asked for, but I don't understand why the cashier felt the need to argue with me and give me an attitude, I just wanted what I paid for, cheese fries.",
