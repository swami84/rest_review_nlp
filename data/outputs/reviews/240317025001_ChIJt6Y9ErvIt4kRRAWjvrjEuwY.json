Today, I ordered via a third-party delivery app and was not pleased. I ordered a gluten free crepe because I am allergic to gluten, fully expecting that the business would update the charges (as they have done in the past). Instead, I received a regular crepe with a nasty note about how it wasn\u2019t gluten free because I didn\u2019t pay. As frequent customers of this business, and I am extremely disappointed in this incident. The only reason I\u2019m not giving this review one or two stars is because we have never experienced this behavior before with this business, and I hope it\u2019s an isolated incident - everyone has bad days, and maybe this was one.",

To make a long story short communication seems to be an issue as there was a small language barrier while placing my order. I ordered the grilled chicken crepe and added spinach which was an additional $1 (cashier didn't mention this but I saw it on the receipt). Only to receive my crepe with no spinach. Of course I did not see this until I got back to my car to check it by cutting into it. the taste flavor was literally just okay, so I ended up returning it and asking for a refund since I was running late for work and refused to waste $12 for something that wasn't correct. This exchange took about 5 minutes, again due to the language barrier. Im happy others enjoy it but I will not be back.",

Rather than an upcharge ($2 or $4 more to make a menu crepe gluten free) they charge $10 base fee for the crepe itself, plus the cost of each individual ingredient. The gluten containing crepe I wished for was $9 on the normal menu, but gluten free would have been $16 ($10 for GF flour, water, and egg + $6 worth of the toppings)  For a regular person, it seems to be a great place.

This price does not include any topping, and even butter on the crepe costs .50 cents.  The averege cost of a crepe on their menu, each with 2-3 toppings, is between $6-$8, but the price for me to get a gf crepe with those same 2-3 toppings, costed double that. I understand that gf anywhere incurs an extra cost, but this is obvious price gouging. What would make more sense would be to add a $2-$3 up charge for a gf crepe, but $10 for a base without any toppings is absurd. The cost for a bag of the gf crepe mix that they advertise using costs $26 a bag. The final hurt to that was that the crepe was horribly undercooked. It was half raw batter.  When we questioned the price (as it was even higher than they advertised on the menu, apparently they hadn't changed the menu price but they had in the computer  due to \"ingredient cost increases\")  and the quality, the woman at the cash register took a $5 bill and tossed it to us after arguing with what I'm assuming was her husband in front of us.  I love crepes. I was excited to find a place that served gf ones, since my dietary restrictions make that difficult. I did not love Fenton Cafe.",

First I got a different crepe than the one I ordered with some weird textures creme in it which can happen and is ok but then they made me a new one but added the cinnamon. I hate to send food back but I just can't stand cinnamon. The crepe was not really a crepe, more like a pancake texture and thickness wise. Also, my crepe barely had any apple sauce in it...probably about I regular spoon full, which didn't make me taste much of apple sauce at all especially because that crepe was so thick. But I was able to taste honey?! Where did the honey come from? Shortly after finishing I started feeling sick for about an hour...sorry, but I cannot recommend this place to anyone. The price of over $6 for a simple crepe with a hint of apple sauce is way too overpriced, the price list on Google was much cheaper than the prices they had when we walked in.Also the staff isn't the friendliest you'll meet. Giving 2 stars because my boyfriends crepes were a bit better but still not very good.",

Well worth a visit. Metered street parking (free Sundays) and a municipal lot around the corner. Credit cards accepted over $10. Give it a try!",

The person at the register informed me that they no longer accept their Groupon/Living Social vouchers.  She eventually relented, but not before letting me know what an imposition it was. When I returned the dishes after eating, I complimented them on their crepes and was pretty much ignored. Too bad, I would have liked to have returned. What's the point of issuing a voucher if only to alienate potential return business?",

I even subsequently confirmed with Groupon to ensure that it was indeed still valid and that I was not mistaken. Had the Groupon actually expired or if the staff provided an apology or legitimate reason for not accepting it, I would have undoubtedly given them a chance.

Upon presenting Groupon (purchased just six days before visit), was flatly told \"the owner doesn't accept those anymore.\"  I pointed out that it did not expire until December and was still posted for sale on Groupon (and was still a week later). Staff member simply glowered, shook her head, \"no.\"  Ridiculous.",

I bought the deal a few weeks ago, and it expires a month and a half from now, but when I went to Fenton Cafe today, the woman behind the counter told me the shop decided this week to no longer accept the deal--either at the discount or face-value level.  That's basically going into a contract with someone, accepting their money, and then refusing to serve them what they paid for. After some negotiation with Groupon (hard to do), Groupon has agreed to refund what I paid, but I shouldn't have to waste time trying to recoup my money and hope that Groupon will follow through. The people at this restaurant should honor their commitments. If Groupon isn't a good deal for them, they shouldn't just randomly cancel on customers who have already paid up. Very bad form. Spoiled what should have been a pleasant lunch outing with my son. Needless to say, we wouldn't eat there after such treatment.",

The crepes are still delicious- best I've ever had- but the service is awful. The last few times I have been, they have either gotten my order wrong or completely forgotten something that I ordered. The last time I went was the last time I will ever go and it is because of the way they handled their mistake. I ordered a hot chocolate and two crepes, a chicken pesto and a raspberry with nutella. When they brought out the order, they had forgotten the hot chocolate completely and brought a banana crepe instead of the raspberry. When I pointed out that the order was wrong, they tried to convince me that I had ordered the banana crepe by showing me the ticket. Then they took the crepe back and stuffed some raspberries on top of the bananas. I told them that I really did not want bananas in it, I just wanted the raspberry crepe that I had ordered originally. So, they took it back, scraped out the bananas and brought it back to me. By this time, my crepe had been handled so much that it was cold and soggy. They should have just made the crepe that I had originally ordered when they realized that they had gotten it wrong. This was handled so poorly that I will not be going back and I will not recommend it to anyone else.",

Nice thick and full of nomnom toppings like turkey, cheese, eggs, mushrooms, tomato and avocado. Excellent balance between eggy cheesy goodness and light soft crepe. Stop by our new favorite small family own crepe place.  Nutella and Banana Crepe $5 (4/5 NOMs). Today we eat NUTELLLA! You just got to start the day with desert crepes especially when nutella is involved. Nutella is amazing and everything and anything with it is super nomnom. Combine that with super light and flavorful crepes they make here you get great desert. Stop by this nice little family own cafe.",

        "caption": "Fenton Cafe and their wonderful crepes are another bright spot on this drag out of downtown Silver Spring. Very affordable, very delicious. The crepes aren't going to light the world on fire, but they definitely are great reminders of the street food of Paris and Montreal.  With 32 sweet and 16 savory varieties, the menu is wide (if not often deep... many are simply variations of others). Great coffee, very friendly staff.  The place seats at most 16, but if you're willing to share a table it's a great way to linger the morning away.  Plenty of ample parking either on street or at the two nearby county surface lots both a block away in either direction.",

It took about a half hour to get our food after ordering and then they messed up 3 out of our 4 crepes which were simple orders aright off the numbered menu. The restaurant is cramped and uncomfortable with insufficient seating. I would try somewhere else before coming here for crepes...",
