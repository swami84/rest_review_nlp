I've been to both locations and the main difference is that this location focuses almost exclusively on sandwiches while the other includes groceries.  The sandwiches are wonderful and you can't really pick a wrong one (out of the 100+ options they have on the menu). They are also enormous as most people will tell you. Prices are on their way up, but the sizes are large enough so that you still get a fantastic value.  The only thing I would suggest is making it easier to make your own sandwich. You'd think that your option would be there, considering all the ones you have to choose from, but sometimes you want something a little more custom. If they had their available ingredients on the menu, it would make this process easier.  In the end, great shop. Go here to get something.",
