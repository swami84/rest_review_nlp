Dishes were, for the most part, not incredibly imaginative, but they were all executed very well with a general respect for the ingredients and seasonality. Wine pairings were all correct, though only one was truly remarkable. The outdoor lodge was an excellent compromise for socially distant dining. We had no problem with the size, but taller/ larger people may have trouble fitting inside.",

The lodges are super cute\u2014great for pictures\u2014they look like mini greenhouses and only fits up to two guests\u2014they are individually heated too!  There is also a Bluetooth speaker if you want to set up and play your own music.  Food was delicious and well presented (in a fancy and bougie way).  We ordered the Coddle Egg, Foie Gras Gateau, Poached Lobster, Black Cod and the Iwate Wagyu Zabuton.  The wagyu was amazing, highly recommend this dish and worth the $15 upgrade charge!  I was not a huge fan of the Foie Gras, it tasted sweet and had the texture of a cake (not the typically Foie Gras taste I normally eat).  Desserts were great, we had the Ambrosia and Chocolate Crunch\u2014they also brought out additional mini complementary desserts for us to try.  Also, we were able to order basic cocktails off the menu!  One thing I really appreciated about this place was that in between each course, they offered some suggested (complimentary) drink\u2014either tea, broth, etc.\u2014to cleanse your palette for the next course!  And service here is top notch!",

I tried almost all menus on the course and none disappointed. would go for the lobster than the foie gras though. loved the wagyu too (+$)",

Turns out, we lived A LOT! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a The 1.5 hour experience was actually almost 2 hours to enjoy a four course menu, cocktails, and all the surprises from the kitchen along the way (drinks and bites). Sherman helped us throughout to make good selections. The rest of the staff here pay attention to the details (almost mind readers). I took off my suit jacket and placed it on the bench; someone came to hang it up. I used my napkin to wipe a spill; someone brought me another one. New silverware with every plate. The chef actually served us the duck, which was another nice surprise. I haven't said much about the food - trust me, it was delicious.  Complex flavors. Stunning presentations. Perfect portions. Great memories. I smile even thinking about it. I encourage you to try a Michelin restaurant. I strongly encourage you to make this one your first one. Thank you all for your hard work \ud83d\udc4d",

After being at our table for an hour exactly, I wasn\u2019t allowed to order my husband another drink but no one really explained this; I had to figure it out. The waiter looked annoyed and didn\u2019t explain a thing when I asked for the drink. He simply said \u201cgive me a second.\u201d The next person (allegedly the manager) came by for our check. I told him I had asked the waiter for a drink for my husband and would need the bill adjusted. He then told me they were booked back to back and could not give us another drink but could recommend plenty of nice bars (during COVID in DC? Ok).  When he came back for signature I asked about the time limit. He said it was 1 hour 15 mins (this has never happened before and was not explained in the confirmation email). I told them two other tables were there before we came and are still enjoying drinks. I also told him we go there regularly and recommend the place to many, but were disappointed with this experience. He had zero explanation and simply apologized. The table of 4-6 continued to hang out and enjoy drinks.  They add automatic 22% tip which is usually  fine, but tonight that tip was not deserved. We were rushed while others got to stay much longer. We won\u2019t be returning. Definitely not Michelin level tonight, Bresca.  ********  We went here based off of a friend's recommendation to do the Chef's Tasting experience. We were not disappointed. From the moment we walked in and got a delicious, refreshing welcome drink, to the last bite, everything was exceptional. I really enjoyed the 90s hip-hop instrumental music in the background; many may not notice it but we loved it and it took us back! Very pricey meal (with cocktails and a bottle of wine) but it was SO well worth the Michelin-star experience.",

Crunchy but not too hard on the outside, the crust flakes as you bite into it and gives way to fluffy yet dense buttery inside. The wedge salad was well presented and tasted wonderful. The cocktail shrimp were large, delicious, and the cocktail sauce is on an entirely different level than any other you'll ever taste. The robuchon potatoes are what you have always wished mashed potatoes could be, taste and texture wise. The crispy baby potato on top was a pleasant touch. The mushrooms and shallots would shine by themselves in and other pairing but are proper supporting actors in this ensemble. They add but don't steal the spotlight from everything else. All you need to know about the steak is that it is textbook perfection. The chocolate tart mirrors the rest of the meal, in that it brings together every texture and flavor you expect but it adds something special in an exquisite yet understated presentation.",

It felt less  comforting and warm like the ingredients suggest and more like alcoholic tamarind flavored medicine (no warmth from chai or freshness from pear..?) -Tuna tartare was too salty for the size of the cracker sandwich. It could've played more in adding to the comforting grain tastes of the cracker. -Foie Gras with the fried waffle was too rich and heavy. Fried waffle felt soaked in oils -Rich foie gras was followed by a heavy tajarin with immense creamy buttery richness. (Too much) -Tajarin: lemon did not add enough freshness to offset richness, chicken skin could've been larger in pieces to add texture (muddled as crumbs) -Hokkaido scallops: these are notoriously sweet and fresh. The sauce and style masked any sweetness or freshness. If this was normal scallops, it would be fine but it doesn't use them well. The sauce is and crust make the whole thing very salty. More hazelnuts or use a nut with a less woody muted aftertaste like peanuts to add that punch (again buttery and salty after the last two was too much). -Beef tenderloin: the sauces felt disjointed and, again made the dish salty given the intense salty umami of the shiitake (which was great btw). Bordelaise was too much with all the sauces. -white chocolate tart: textures of tart filling and cream under the ice cream make the whole thing too soft. The cream below the ice cream had an odd bitter after taste like they used the leaves of a strawberry as well (not sure if intentional). The pastry shell was dense and stiff in an odd way that make the filling feel bland and dry.  Praise: -The palette cleanser was so tasty. I ordered another small glass. A person near me ordered a full cup of it! Mm. It was aromatic and fresh. It felt like lychee and guava candies making it homey for me. -my Sober Pineapple was delicious. The yeast after taste was really satisfying. Adding the basil gave a whole different experience. Freshness was helpful in eating the rich food (but I had to drink a lot of it) -initial tasting was really well thought out. Brioche crumb were aromatic. The crab gave in giving a very satisfying mouth feel. -cracker sandwich with tuna. Good spices, great cracker with aromatic flavors. -foie gras itself was delicious. Cocao nibs added such a well rounded dark note. -Shiitake mushroom and shallots were cooked amazingly well, added different depths to the tenderloin when eaten together with the creamy smooth white sauce. Bordelaise was well done. -pastry shell of tart had a great taste but odd mouth feel. The saltiness really added to the cream of the tart. (I just didn't like that filling overall).",

We made a 6pm reservation because it was either that or 8pm and I had read a few reviews that said that the duck gets sold out and I really really wanted to try it.  They have really interesting cocktails, so we started off the meal with a few of those and then also ordered a nice bottle of wine that was reasonably priced - only a 2x markup of a good bottle, so that was surprising.  For food, we shared: Bread and butter with trout roe - this was delicious, perfectly fluffy bread, butter that goes very well with the salt of the roe Shaved beef - this was interesting, but very good.  There were crispy pieces to it, and then shaved beef sprinkled around Beet salad - very nice flavors with a delicious sauces Scallop - also a solid dish Foie gras - as good as foie gras always is and this was well prepared.  The best part was the steamed brioche that you dip into the sauce of the foie gras after - it's like a dumpling almost Short Rib large format - wow this was incredible and a huge portion, definitely order if they have it on the menu Rohan Duck Presse - they only have 4 per night and we got one of them, and wow it was incredible.  They come and prepare table side so the presentation is fun too.  I order duck a lot and I'm struggling to think of one that I liked better than this.  The flavors are so amazing and condensed that there's a party in your mouth. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and all the accompaniments that come with the duck were great - the duck leg taste in particular was very good  For dessert, I got the foie gras cake pop, because I love foie gras.  It wasn't overpowering of foie gras, so you tasted more of the cake.  We also ordered the chocolate dessert from the tasting menu and a fruit meringue dessert I think.  The chocolate bar was quite delicious  They were very gluten free friendly for my husband, I think he could almost eat everything.  This place is definitely worth coming to!",

Our waitress did an excellent job explaining the menu and wine pairings to the table next to us, however we didn\u2019t receive the same level of service or explanations.  Maybe because it was Restaurant Week the staff wanted to get people in and out without providing the \u201cexcellent\u201d service others mention in their reviews.  Bresca is worth a try IMO, however DC has many restaurants, both Michelin rated and not rated, that offer either better or just as good food and service.  I\u2019ll get my Michelin star fix at Pineapples and Pearls, Blue Duck Tavern, Rose\u2019s Luxury... next time.",

The interior is so whimsical and quirky, with its honeycomb accents and live moss wall. Upon sitting down, I ordered the Bee's Knees ($16). I was pleasantly surprised to see that it came out of a bee-shaped cocktail glass, after having read on Yelp that they had discontinued its use after several of these gorgeous glasses breaking in the past. The drink itself was lovely and balanced with gin, mead, honey, and lemon.  The food menu was divided into snacks, medium plates, and large plates. The server recommended that if we order a large plate, we could order 1-2 medium plates and that would suffice. After a couple of perusals and questions to our server, we ultimately settled for the following plates:  + Broccoli pierogi ($23): smoked cipollini, goat gouda, potato, and onion soubise + Scallop mi-cuit ($16): turnip, buttermilk, horseradish, lime + Rohan duck \u00e0 la presse ($118): 21-day dry-aged duck breast with coriander and pink peppercorn crust and local honey; savory duck leg tart with mountain rose, mustard seed, and bronze fennel; and a salad of braised apple, baby fennel, noisette butter, and mustards  The pierogi was spectacular. I wish there were more. They should make it as a large plate. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was definitely the duck. This is an old-school French dish, where a traditional press for this technique extracts the blood and bone marrow from the duck into a sauce. The juices are collected in a pan and strained, and the sauce is served on top of the duck. There are only four ducks available each night, served first come, first served. The best part of the whole experience is that the pressing of the duck and the cooking of the sauce are all done right next to you at the table! The duck was fantastic. The sauce. Oh, the sauce. That was extraordinary. A magical, sublime moment.  We had a wonderful dinner. The food, the service, the ambiance were all remarkable. Very worthy of its accolades and the price tag.",

There was literally no where to stand other than pressed against the wall near the door. Not an inspiring start.  From there on, the experience was only positive as we were sat on time and treated with excellent beverages, perfectly thought out appetizers (the shaved beef is a novel concept that was almost as good as the brioche), and an amazing take on roast chicken.  The menu is quite limited, but that obviously allows them to focus on the few dishes they have to achieve borderline perfection. Worthy of its single Michelin star and recommended.",

We did the tasting menu with wine pairing (the whole table must participate) along with the bread and butter and a cocktail to start.  I was really impressed by the interior design at Bresca and the attention to detail each course delivered. I was especially happy with the pasta they offered, and everything paired really well with the wines. I also really enjoyed the Wagyu flat iron along with the Fois Gras cake pops. There was a point in the evening where they served the wine a little bit too pre maturely before the next course but that\u2019s hardly an issue.  Overall a really great experience, and I look forward to dining here again.",

I have eaten all over and when comparing this to Alinea in Chicago or other Michelin rated restaurants it's is a let down.  2. The chefs tasting menu comes out far too slowly. You shouldn't have people falling asleep at their tables waiting for the next course as I saw tables near me nodding off or taking bathroom breaks to kill the time.  3. The palette cleanser was a shot of vinegar. Why did you think this was a good idea.  4. Vinegar was an overall theme here from start to finish, coming back in many dishes, where it certainly didn't need to make an appearance was in the strange, highly salty chocolate cake that that pickeled cherries.  To top it all off we finished with a press post of coffee that came 1. Boiling hot (not recommended for best coffee, 176 to 190 is just fine. 2. The coffee itself was an aggressive  roast.  Other items, your Wagyu should be medium rare which is awesome and how I recieved it, but make your plate hot, because by the time the meat made it to my table it was lukewarm. It should still be hot to my tongue.  Wait staff was nice and the restaurant was pleasant, but how you outrated the Blue Duck astounds me.",

We decided on the tomato habanero cocktail and the Bee\u2019s Knees (which absolutely lives up to it\u2019s name. Where can I get those glasses?), And ordered the scallop small plate, as a starter, followed by the dry aged strip loin, cooked medium rare. I could go on for hours describing the wonderful food, but I will not, I\u2019ll use one word, Succulent!  We will be back, and we won\u2019t be alone, gotta share the wealth.  Thank you.

Its honestly impressive that the chef managed to make foie gras - one of the most famously flavorful ingredients - taste like cardboard. I would have preferred a frozen chicken dinner from the Trader Joe's next door. I will not be going back to Bresca ever, even though I live just blocks away.",

It is greatly worth it to have the tasting menu as the plates are well thought out and not one plate did not have the correct combination of flavors well thought out and tested to a T. They are a sustainable restaurant using every part of every ingredient and treat it in such a way that you can feel the love and enthusiasm that the kitchen puts into it. The waitress was extremely kind and when we waited a bit longer for one of the courses she didn\u2019t think twice to top up our paired wines. This place will most likely get its second star, so take advantage of this opportunity to frequent this if you are local or try it while traveling, as that tasting menu should be up in the $85-95 range and is greatly worth it. Ps. Not all pictures posted as I was too excited when a couple dishes came out.",

Then came the asparagus salad. The asparagus was perfect.  The halibut was also perfect with a nice mix of veggies and a sauce that was the perfect accent. The tenderloin was cooked perfect served with a nice salad. The sauce for the beef was amazing. I would buy it and use it every day if possible. Dessert was an ambrosia which had great flavor and highly recommend. I did not think I would like it. We also tried the four grass pop and it was okay and the only thing we had that did not wow us. Overall I would give them 2 stars and highly recommend.",

It was just offer. It came with a dip and the dip was perfect. For dessert, I ordered tropical ambrosia. The tropical fruit in the outside felt weird in the beginning. But once I mixed everything together, it was heaven. It was definitely worth the money and I would highly recommend it.",

Great craft cocktails here although they do have wine and beer as well. The menu is such that you can either graze through an array of small plates or go with the standard appetizer then entree format. We especially enjoyed the foie gras pate with hot beignets which was genius as the paste melts onto the hot bread... The desserts were also very interesting and delicious. On street parking only and in an interesting neighborhood. With a trip!",

The snacks were puffed beef tendon and asparagus, both were delicious. The next course was a masterpiece, scallops in a lime buttermilk sauce with caviar, grapes, and snap peas. This was a very well done play on sweet and salty, and several textures. When you got that perfect bite with each piece it was HEAVENLY. They next course was ricotta gnudi, which my date said was splendid, but as I\u2019m GF they provided my an asparagus dish over potatoes that was very good. The main course, veal with veggies and a mushroom puuree was phenomenal. The flavor was wonderful, the veal could\u2019ve even been cut with a fork it was so tender and juicy. The desert was a Black Forest desert with cherry sorbet, which tasted purely of black cherries (in the absolute best way possible). My replacement was a mango dragonfruit dish with very light, crisp, well cooked meringue that was another masterpiece of making the perfect bites. The plates were well balanced, packed with rich, delicate, enticing flavors, and more than worth the trip. This was wonderful.",

The duck is king here, if you dine here and don\u2019t get the duck - honestly I\u2019m sorry for you.* Every dish we had was something about which to write home. Foie gras and beignets was not something I ever expected to need in my life, but it was so exciting and so good. Just inject it into my veins. Did I mention it was so good?  Service was obviously great. The cocktails were all great, but the Bees Knees comes in a cool bee cup - so definitely go with that one. The design of the restaurant was so cool; it was a great atmosphere. Honestly, the bathroom was so nice that I could have eaten my whole meal in there and been happy.  If I had to come up with a complaint, it would be that I would have liked some music. We ate there on a Tuesday though - perhaps they have music on weekends.  You should probably just go make a reservation now.  *Unless you\u2019re a vegetarian. We did have two vegetarians with us and they both loved the meal despite being sadly deprived of the duck.",

The bold and tasty palette cleansing was apple cider shrub was followed by a flavourless oyster and disappointing beef tendon puff. Fortunately, the dishes mostly improved from there. The Shima aji was well balanced and the smoked potato perogies were sumptuous. The guinea hen was well cooked and presented in two ways but the taste was nothing special. Finally, dessert was good, but unidimensional. Of note, the main dining room is ludicrously loud at full service.",

If 1 person gets the sample menu, then everyone at the table also has to participate. I don't usually like wines or alcohol, but I was impressed with their paired sparkling wine and cocktails. The staff was amazing and smartly made suggestions for food or drinks based on my requests. The savory vegetables and sauces complemented the variety of tuna, red snapper, and wagyu beef. It was also my first time trying sea urchin, but I was very pleased with its smooth creamy texture.  Each dish from sample appetizer all the way through to dessert were delicious.

It wasn't just the scallops that shined, the catelinni, the different purees and the pickled onions tasted great and harmonized well together. The passionfruit dessert was larger than I expected and great for sharing. At first I thought it was just a meringue on top but to my surprise there was more depth in this dessert. I left the restaurant full but wanting to try more dishes. I would definitely recommend this place!",

Most items on the menu are medium-sized. There are a few small plates,  and just two large plates, of which the duck is one. It was fantastic. Very rich, but the two of us  ate the whole thing after having eaten several other dishes before. The veal breast, uni linguini, and the duck are stand-out dishes.",

The cold just overpowered the roe and the salt of the roe made worse by the ice cream. Fish and ice cream: do not recommend. But aside from that, everything was delicious, the wait staff friendly and attentive, and the overall atmosphere very comfortable.

It's pretty difficult to find another place like that in DC. It's not super posh, nor pretentious; it's a great opportunity to have a food experience like you never had. So, have faith and follow the chef into this culinary wonderland. It will be a surprise that you will never forget.",
