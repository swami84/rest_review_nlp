Don't get me wrong, it's not bad food at all.  It's just that there are some things left out sometimes -- bibimbap, for example, doesn't come with a fried egg on top and lettuce is used.  It's alright.  Gets you out of angry hunger mode, it's more delicious than many of the other stands in the food court, but it is missing that little bit extra that makes up greatness.  I'd definitely eat here often, just because it's the closest Korean restaurant to my place of employment, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  It's just really convenient.",
