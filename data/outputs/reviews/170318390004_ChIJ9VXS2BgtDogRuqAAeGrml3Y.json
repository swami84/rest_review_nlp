Delighted to dine in a place where people are talking to each other and not competing over music that is way too loud. The interior is beautiful. Someone really cared.  I spoke to the co-owner Steven the first time I went to the Grail Cafe. The tag line is \"where goodness can be found\". He said he and his business partner really wanted the cafe to be a community-focused place; a place where people would socialize, break bread, talk about what was happening in the community, run into neighbors.  My partner and I had a great salad one time and a dinner cooked in paper. The pastries are fantastic and from an area bakery.  They have very creative and healthful specials.  I hope people give them a chance and understand they are still getting their bearings as a new cafe and give them feedback directly.  An area cafe owner was actually trolling them! Geez! Let's support this new cafe, not tear them down in their first size months of operation.  Don't we want new businesses to succeed?",

The menu is small and that's a good thing, you can tell the owners have put a lot of thought into what they make. The imported mozzarella sandwich is a delight, the fresh burrata adding a nice creamy feel on fluffy foccacia. They have specials that are always changing. They serve Hexe coffee, a local Chicago roastery, and it's the first time I've had it. Everyone is super friendly and nice. This place is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale neighborhood foodwise.",

The sensation of the first bite of the kale quinoa salad lightly dressed in a fennel vinaigrette left a pleasant taste quite unexpectedly. The cappuccino made with oat milk was not sweet but did not need added sweetener.  You could feel the heart and soul embedded in the decorum of the cafe, thanks to Steven and his husband, the proprietors. The staff seemed to enjoy being there which may also be a reflection of the owners. What a wonderful addition for higher quality food at a reasonable price in Printers Row.  We will definitely be returning.",
