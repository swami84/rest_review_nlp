I ordered off GrubHub and the pictures made my mouth water just thinking about how good this sandwich was going to be. What I got was a very different story (pictures posted because \"pics or it didn't happen)  Instead of the nice sandwich pictured, I got a thin fried chicken breast on a hoagie and a sad strip of plastic cheese. I expected for a most popular item that it would have been better and though it says honey butter they either missed putting it on as there was not a hint of honey nor butter, or the sauce is tasteless. And the fries  had either been cooked in old oil or left to sit too long.  I would not order from here again",
