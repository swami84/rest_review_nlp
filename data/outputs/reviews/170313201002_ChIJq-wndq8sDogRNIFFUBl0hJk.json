I start from the negative notes, the restaurant closes at 11pm, and literally chase you away once the time is up. When we sit down, it was late about 21:15, we avevavo put a bit of a hurry warning us that the kitchen was about to close, but not what would happen next. Particular and tasty cocktails. Concentrated culinary offer, but the quality was very good. The sore point is that although the particular environment, very informal, prices are high and the service is not up to what is done to pay. Plates put on the table with two cutlery and a napkin placed inside. (See the photos)  (Original) Abbiamo cenato in questo ristorante posto al primo piano del Virgin Hotel in quanto vi abbiamo soggiornato. Parto dalle note negative, il ristorante chiude alle 23, e letteralmente ti cacciano via una volta scattato l'orario. Al momento di sederci, era tardi circa le 21.15, ci avevavo messo un p\u00f2 di fretta avvisandoci che la cucina stava per chiudere, ma non quello che sarebbe accaduto poi. Cocktails particolari e gustosi. Offerta culinaria concentrata, ma la qualit\u00e0 era molto buona. La nota dolente \u00e8 che  pur essendo l'ambiente particolare, molto informale, i prezzi sono elevati ed il servizio non \u00e8 all'altezza di quanto viene fatto pagare. Piatti messi sul tavolo con due posate ed un tovagliolo messi dentro. (Guardate le foto)",

A little miscommunication amongst staff with regards to food allergies but our server was gracious and apologetic and took the utmost care after that to ensure our safety. The food was delightful with tea time but truth be told, I have an appetite and everything little was not going to cut it. The pastries though were really good, especially the lemon bar.
