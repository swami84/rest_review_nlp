        "caption": "Chose to give Brindille a shot after a LOT of looking over info on various high-end restaurants in Chicago - we were NOT disappointed.  Heavy traffic delayed us, I called and advised them, they said thanks, and we showed 20 minutes late to a very hearty welcome.  We brought along two bottles of fine wine from my cellar: a dry white 2014 \"Y\" from the Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem, and a 1990 Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem which absolutely floored us for its perfection!  \"Y\" is also called \"Ygrec,\" which is the French name for that letter of the alphabet.  We also bought a bottle of 2013 Albert Boxer Gewurztraminer Reserve from Alsace.  Two of us dined on the following, sharing dishes:  Appetizers, which were generously portioned:  CHESAPEAKE BAY SOFT SHELL CRAB Charred Heirloom Tomato, Red Onion & Proven\u00e7al Black Olives with soft white corn polenta, roquette leaves and french date vinegar butter. Amazing crab, especially in Chicago, where they're not pulled out of nearby waters.  Also quite liked the polenta, and the overall flavors were well chosen.  Eaten with two wines we brought, preferred with Ygrec.  CRISP BELLY OF BERKSHIRE PORK Cardamom Roasted Pineapple & Pickled Ramps, Beauty Heart Radish and Candied Pecans, Natural Jus with Kishmish \"Green\" Raisins, Blueberries, and While Balsamic \"Crisps.\" Delicious, juicy, tender, flavorsome bit of pork with a nice then layer of crispy fat.  Everything that was part of it built the whole up to the spectacular appetizer which this was - went best with some of the Yquem.  SEARED HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAS - (FROM GOOSE) Blackberry, Amber Afghani Saffron and Strawberry Friponnes, Anise Seed and Tarragon Savory Toast, Green Almondine Tea Gel\u00e9e, Banyuls, Anise Hissop and Mach\u00e9. It is hard to mess up Foie Gras if you're competent in your kitchen, and these folks definitely did it justice.  I'd say a trip to Brindille is worth making JUST to eat this!  It was marvelous with the '90 Yquem.  SEA SCALLOPS NAHA SCENTED WITH VANILLA BEAN, Citrus and Spices, Caramelized Belgian Endive \"Marmalade,\" Late Summer Plums, Frangrant Marigold and Bergamot Flowers with a Nage of Carrot, Coriander and Lemongrass Just superb!  Properly caramelized scallops, looking like a perfectly toasted marshmallow, are a special favorite of both of us.  These were nicely succulent both the Ygrec and the Yquem, but in the end, the Yquem was even better.  Entr\u00e9es, which were also generous and amazing!  Well, we were disappointed to learn that the Sole Meunier on the menu was not available, it had been a major motivator for our choice, but other items on the menu undid our sadness.  BUTTER POACHED MAINE LOBSTER, 'Corn on the Cob,' Striped Beets and Jerusalem Artichoke, Salpicon of Gold Beets and Celery, Celery Root, Crustacean Lobster Broth and Summer Garden Herb Salad. Ooooh, LOBSTER!  Juicy and succulent and perfectly cooked, again, all those things combined with it were just perfection on a plate of flavors.  It went well with both the Ygrec and Yquem, but we both preferred the Yquem.  Lacquered Aged Moulard Duck Breast with a Pav\u00e9 Tarte of \"Red Haven\" Peaches, Roasted Fennel, and Tropea Onions, Medjool Date, Braised Leeks, Bronze Fennel, and Apple Mint. As with the lobster, another perfection of (different) flavors on a plate.  many people would want to drink red wine with duck, but those in the know are aware that a good Sauternes can pair amazingly with it, and for us, the Yquem took this tasty duck to an even higher level.  FORTUNATELY, we'd paced ourselves so as to be able to enjoy the artisanal cheese selection as our final.  It consisted of a dozen French Cheeses.  I've attached a photo of the list, so am abbreviating them here, along with which wine we determined was the best compliment.  For my comments, please see the pic, as I've exceeded my character limit.",

Carrie's skill as a chef is legendary, certainly well known in this country and recognized by the James Beard Foundation.  Michael's business acumen, and aplomb as a restauranteur, helped put Chicago on the \"foodie\" map.  Yet, most importantly, their warmth, love for family, good food, and happy times reverberates through every restaurant they open.  Brindille is a classic French restaurant, that just happens to be in Chicago.  We were just in Paris for a week, and Brindille would be comfortable as a Michelin starred dining destination, sitting on a block in the sixth, seventh, eighth, sixteenth, or seventeenth arrondissements. As River North changes, overtaken by the hordes of drunken young people, looking for another beer, margarita and fish taco, Brindille sits on Clark Street as a beacon of fine dining. The patrons of Brindille know what Carrie and Michael offer; great food, elegant surroundings, and a dining refuge. Chicago is lucky to have Brindille.  Go and discover what fine dining is all about.  This is grown up elegance.",

People offering to take our coats as we walked in, offer us a cocktail or drinks, and more.  The food was pretty good overall as well. Kicked off with oysters, went into greens/meats, and ended up delicious desserts. Man the dessert was awesome - macaroons, cookies, and more. Very impressed.  The ambiance of this place is very romantic also. Great date spot.  I'd definitely return here for a date, client dinner, or just to catch up with friends.",

Why not 5 stars? Because of its prices and its (French) wine list too limited (and expensive too).",

The ambiance is subdued as the crowd skews noticeably older, likely thanks to the steep prices and extensive wine list.  Everything we ordered was beautifully presented, rich in flavor, and flawlessly prepared.
