Our first experience with Nadim's was a Thanksgiving Dine to Donate event with Big Brothers Big Sisters that we participated in.  I was already impressed by the fact that Nadim's was a participating restaurant.  So when we received our food, I was even more impressed!  We ordered the beef, chicken and salmon kabobs, which were excellent.  We also had their wings and they are AMAZING!  I love the flavor and crave them constantly.   We had rice and salad as well, which was very good.  Recently, because of my cravings, I ordered the wings again.  SO GOOD!  We also had their fries and those are really delicious.  I can't wait to try some of their other dishes too.  I recommend Nadim's to any and everyone looking for a flavorful, well-cooked meal that leaves you wanting more.",

My family and I made a reservation for NYE and literally 20 minutes before our reservation they send a text saying they are running extremely behind and we would have to wait an hour before we are seated. What exactly are reservations for if you have to wait an hour?! To top it off, the kitchen closes at 8 due to COVID so if we had to wait an hour based on our reservation, we would have only had a half hour to order anything...really? I hope the owner sees this and realizes how unfortunate it is, I am sure we were not the only patrons who had to decline their reservation and figure something else out on NYE night.",

        "caption": "Wow has this place fallen off a cliff or what?! I used to populate this establishment almost obsessively two years ago eating at least twice a month here at Nadims but I had moved to another state.. anyways I was in the Springfield area the week of August 10th and just had to stop at Nadims for dinner. Upon arriving I stood for over 15 minutes waiting for any of the staff to acknowledge me to receive a table for dining.. the restaurant only seemed 60-70% full, after being seated I sat unattended for another 10 minutes before randomly multiple waitresses decided to try taking my order.. I\u2019m not sure how such confusion could take place because each waiter or waitress is supposed to have designated areas.. I was willing to give Nadim\u2019s a pass on this because I know their food is tremendous... well USED TO BE GOOD!! I first was given stale, cold and excessively chewy pita bread (chewy from being so cold and stale) next came my appetizer of Beef Turnovers.. somehow I fried appetizer arrived to my table cold and undercooked in the middle.. how can you mess up a simple fried turnover? Now being completely let down my dinner came and I ordered the Shrimp Kabob with Nadims rice.. yet again the shrimp while being warm was not HOT or steaming suggesting the order was either previously grilled then reheated or was just not grilled long enough to present a hot food item.. the flavor was decent but not to what I remembered and I wish it was hot instead of warm.. the rice was good but a very small portion. To conclude my visit I was overcharged $2 for no specified reason upon asking my waitress she stated that Nadims rice is $2 more However their menus DO NOT TELL YOU THIS, for such a laughably small portion of rice it was ridiculous it cost another $2 on top of an already very overpriced entree.. I felt relieved to finally exit Nadim\u2019s and will never be returning if I\u2019m in the area again... Mr.Nadim what has happened? Your restaurant used to be my ultimate favorite and now I would choose a food truck over it..",

I attempted to inform her that I was told on multiple occasions over the past couple weeks which is upsetting! I AM STRICTLY VEGAN SO THIS IS NOT OKAY!!!! Just when I thought this was a place I could depend on to do me right, NOPE! Disappointing!  EDIT: After receiving a response from the owner and a personal call regarding the issue! I was informed that he would look into it to make sure it does not happen again. Even if they never get another fry later, I happy knowing that he took this matter seriously because that says a lot about the integrity of a person which means a lot.",

A little less drama, a lot less jumping to conclusions, and maybe you'll be happier and do better business.  I reduced the tip amount based on service that I received after asking about the price discrepancy. The server was very defensive, and it was obvious that she was sick of having to explain to people how the sides work. Is it my fault for not noticing the discrepancy until after filling out the tip line? I wasn't trying to \"get my\u00a0$2\u00a0back\", and the server received a substantial tip from us (there were separate checks). Even my updated tip was generous for the service received.  As for the original problem, your menu is poorly organized, and I saw what seemed like 3 different versions while I was there, plus a 4th version on your website. The menu I ordered from clearly states \"with a side of your choice\". Your online menu reflects a price increase for certain sides, but the menu I ordered from did not. The hostess stand menu didn't even have chicken as an option, nor were there any extra charges for sides. It's a bit of a mess. Good luck.  ***Original review*** They'll charge you an extra two dollars for rice if you aren't careful.",

So we get seated and watch the waitress talk to the 3 other tables that had customers in a 8 table zone   no water no menu no nothing, after 10 minutes we left because they didn't deserve any more of our time.  We were showered and smelt of yummy sticky flowers ( not smelling but still feeling good) and were dressed nice. Went down the road and had a spectacular meal and service.  I will give them nice looking food and people seemed to enjoy it but service matters first in my opinion",

The food was flavorful, well priced, and the quantity and quality were equal to the price. We did the sampler for two, and placed a special request for no cilantro, as my mom has the gene that makes cilantro taste like soap. They abided by our request and the entire dinner was fabulous. We then ordered the breadpudding to share for dessert, and it was possibly the best bread pudding I have ever had, and come to find out the secret is it is made with pitas. You must try it, you wont be disappointed. Looking forward to a date night with the mister here soon.",

You get the upscale treatment for the low end price.  The decor was as beautiful as ever. Clean and low lit environment. Very modern design. Reminds me of a swanky Manhattan lounge because of the darker decor.  The food. Yes, please. I usually get the lamb shish kebab with mediterranean rice and an extra side of Veggies. I prefer my lamb cooked medium and it's always perfect and full of flavor. The rice and veggies are seasoned and so full of flavor.  Sometimes, I bring either my 8 yr old son or 10 yr old daughter on a date night. (for one on one time) And we have been offered complimentary fries by the kitchen on a couple of occasions.  The waitstaff visits the table often enough for you to get what you need on time. But of course they don't linger to intrude. Eticic and respect is always formal. However, not up tight and they like to have a good old laugh with you as well.  One of Springfield's best places. A must visit.",

Look at that one poor sad olive and 2 leaves of spinach. Not only that but I told them I had a tomato allergy and I still got tomatoes in the entre I ate there and in the one I got to go... never going to this place again.",
