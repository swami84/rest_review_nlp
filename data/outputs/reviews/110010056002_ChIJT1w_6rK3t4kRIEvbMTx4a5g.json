I arrived at 7:35 pm on Monday night (9/26/16) and the sign on the door said OPEN (their website says they're open until 8). I walked in and got a gruff \"We're closed.\"  I said, but your sign says open, to which he replied \"We're Closed.\"  So, to help with his interruptions & to help other potential customers, on my way out I turned the sign to \"closed\".  I walked a few feet & noticed he had turned it back to read \"open\".  So I went back in and asked \" So are you open or not?\"  The reply was again we're closed, so I asked about the sign and he said \"I can have the sign however I want.\"  I asked if he was simply refusing to serve just me, to which he replied \"What is your f*#$ing problem?\"  I said my problem is that I'm hungry & would like to eat, to which he replied \"Then go to CVS.\"  I've tried for a day and a half to contact the owner or manager, but they are either never there (which could explain much) or the employees have been told to screen calls by saying they aren't there (which is also worrisome).  Needless to say, I'll never go back & I'd advise others to stay away unless you enjoy being treated rudely & getting cussed at merely for trying to give them some business.",
