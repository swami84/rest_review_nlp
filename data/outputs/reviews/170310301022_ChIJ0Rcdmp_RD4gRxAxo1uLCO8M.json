You can't just order 1 or 2 tacos, minimum 3 tacos, which is not a problem for me because those al pastor tacos are so good they just slide, lol. The place is cute, and love listening to the Latin music they play on the radio. Their pi\u00f1a coladas are very good too. Staff is very friendly. On 3 different occasions they brought us soup on the house, shots on the house, and even dessert (flan) on the house, and all very delicious. They really know how to treat their customers.

It came quite quickly and I opened my box and saw that it wasn't like the heaping amount that I would usually get from the other restaurant but still wanted to reserve my opinion about it until I  looked at the tacos and the steak nachos.   The tacos looked good and  had nice amounts of everything my daughter usually liked.   So I ate my nachos and it was tasty but still not as much as the other restaurant.   So just to get to the point despite the serving size and the price it was an okay meal  but  maybe add a little more chips and meat and it would be worth the price of $12.",

My  son ordered a beef burrito and when he comes home there was no beef in it. I called the store, asking them to give my son the correct kind of burrito and the manager (who hung up on me, without revealing his name) told me to bring the burrito back to exchange it. I said the store should really do 2 things: 1. apologize 2. give my son the burrito that he ordered, but NOT an exchange because a. My kid already started eating when he noticed there was no meat b. having been inconvenienced a customer of having to return to the store and hold back on eating dinner till the remaining dish has been returned and showed to the store manager,  the least a restaurant should do is to replace the dinner. Usually, the manager will also either give a free coupon or a discount on the next order. This manager said he can't do either one - that he needs the burrito back and can only replace it IF, indeed there is no beef. So THAT's WHY this review.",
