Best pies in the Springfield area, and a wonderful variety of other pastries, sandwiches, and other things. Seriously, how many places hand-make their own croissants?  Oh yeah, and they have CHOCOLATE FILLED croissants. If I can get one of those, it makes my day.  Their lunch menu has a steady assortment of delicious salads and sandwiches. Tried 'em all. Would order any of them again..  I'm eating a slice of a Smore's pie right now that is so delicious that it's probably illegal in ten states. Last summer my family wound up eating a lot of pie because I was dead-set on trying to emulate their pie crust....",

I got a reminder call from Granny\u2019s that morning for pick up and realized I wouldn\u2019t be able to get there in time. My husband did not want to miss out on that pie. So he called back and explained our dilemma. Granny\u2019s stayed 45 minutes after close to get us that pie! They said they\u2019d wait an hour and if we couldn\u2019t get there in time, they\u2019d donate the pie to a shelter or someone who could enjoy it for the holidays. Truly amazing people. The pies are great, the people even better!",
