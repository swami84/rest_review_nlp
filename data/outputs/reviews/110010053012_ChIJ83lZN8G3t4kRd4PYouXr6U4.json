Zucchini fritters (5/5) Hands-down the best, make room for the appetizer! The crispy fritters had a nice crispy shell stuffed with shredded zucchini and creamy yogurt and feta cheese.  Gryo  (4/5) - Fun and interesting meaty texture made of very thinly sliced shredded crispy tofu with pickled peppers and creamy tzatziki in a pillowy housemade pita. All the flavors blended well together with this innovative dish. The pita wasn't overstuffed and surprisingly not messy, my hubby and I had no problem eating the wraps in the car.  Fryo (3/5) - Crispy french fries stuffed in a pita with tzatziki sauce. It was fun to try, but nothing special. Prefer the Gyro over the Fryo.  Seasonal popsicles (3/5) - Hit/miss depending on the flavor and not quite what I expected. The Vanilla Pecan Dark Chocolate had a tasty dark chocolate pecan shell and had a strong coconut flavor. I preferred the Vanilla Pecan Dark Chocolate over the Fig Greek Yogurt with a bold fig flavor and some notes of ginger. The flavors didn't quite fuse that well with a bit of inconsistency. It was fun to try the homemade popiscles. Pleasant Pops on U street are my favorite!  The innovative dishes loaded with veggies are fun to try and packed with some great flavor. My hubby and I enjoyed the vegetarian feast in our car. If you're looking for something different, give Happy Gryo a go. Lives up to its name!",

My boyfriend and I are making our way through the DC Michelin Star places and decided to try Komi for a belated Valentines dinner. Komi has been the best thus far with zero competition from the others. There\u2019s just no comparison, and the fact that it was almost half the cost of Pineapple & Pearls made it that much better. I have to comment on how amazing the staff is first. Kyle was attentive, hilarious, and knowledgeable. I didn\u2019t catch the name of the woman helping us but she had short brown hair and was just wonderful.  The first 4-5 courses are small but so delightfully balanced and flavorful with simple and fresh ingredients. The figs were to die for and so were the scallops. The pasta we were told is handmade every day and was the best I\u2019ve ever had. Everything was perfectly seasoned and it was timed incredibly well. My partner and I don\u2019t drink but they brought us a non alcoholic drink to try that was just incredible. Everything they brought was better than the last. The desserts at the end were just a perfect finish to the most incredible meal. Can\u2019t wait to go back.",

We managed to sneak a 9pm booking on a friday here and it was hands down the best experience of the weekend (and top 5 in my life). 12-13 courses I think, no beverage pairing but it wasn't needed.  The beer manager knows his $&#* when it comes to Sours and other beers.  Had some great recommendations and my wife enjoyed the wine menu.  I am not even sure how to describe the food.  elegant and simple, but complex and so so delicious.  One of the funnier ones to stand out was a simple salad but it was very good.  The main entree was cabrito (goat) and usually when you have a tasting menu you can leave a little hungry.  Not here - The entree dish alone could have been enough.  We were struggling to get it all down.  On top of that, having talked with the server about being from Texas they sent out some pulled pork from the kitchen as well.  Can't say enough good things about this place and their staff.  For sure will be getting reservations in advance next time, and will hit it up any time we are in the area.  Do not miss this experience, if you love food and an amazing atmosphere and service.",

I was still able to get an 8:30PM reservation which wasn't too bad, especially on a weekend.  The dress code was a step up from business casual.  Dressy casual would be accurate.  I wore slacks, dress shoes, and a button up tucked in and did not feel underdressed.  No jacket or tie.  The courses and presentation altogether will take time.  We left around 11:30PM and were completely satisfied.  This is my second Michelin star restaurant and the experience was phenomenal.  The service was laid back and inviting.  It really puts you at ease.  We did the wine pairing with the meal and it was excellent as well.  About 3-4 different wines and one craft beer were served to us throughout the meal.  If you finish your glass they will happily refill you promptly.  One thing I would do differently on a return trip would be to take it easy on the drinking because it filled me up.  The food was rich, succulent, and surprisingly satiating given the sizes of the dishes.  The service really stood out because of the casualness and friendliness of the staff.  A dish would be brought out and described to you. Any questions were answered with enthusiasm and a smile.  Some dishes weren't always given a full presentation, they were just delivered and named.  It created a well paced dinner.  The time didn't seem to drag once and we were completely saitiated before dessert even came out.  Highly recommended for your Michelin star restaurant needs!",

We were able to get a last minute reservation for a random weekday based on their availability online. They promptly followed up via email and made sure to consider any food allergies or preferences we had. They also verified our preferences when we sat down just to be sure. The small dining area made for an intimate dining experience and everything was exceptionally cooked. The dishes were inventive and perfectly cooked to the point that I wished I could have more. We unfortunately did not do the wine pairing but, even without it, we were at Komi for about 3 hours. The service was very professional as expected. There's limited street parking but a garage just around the corner that was a convenient walk. Overall, I'd definitely consider going back but really only for a special occasion given the $150 per person bill not including wine pairing. The only negative of the night was the $16 glass of Riesling.",

The main courses were pretty large though so you should leave feeling satisfied with the amount of food. I usually have the opposite issue where I get full too easily. At Komi, dinner is spaced out over a few hours so it was enough time to eat everything without getting over full.  The food itself definitely stood out. The combination of house brewed birch beer and oven roasted cheese stuffed date was a delicious stand out. The small bites had nicely balanced strong flavors while the mains were well executed more gentle flavors in greater quantity.  Komi maintains a comfortable and upscale atmosphere without feeling oppressivly fancy. Our waiter swapped local restaurant suggestions with us so that was really nice.",

The bite croquette had a taste like eating a Caesar salad and the shoulder loin of the goat with bone slowly baked for more than 48 hours, so it melted at the moment I put it in my mouth. It was a dish of life number one in the meat dish. Of course the price is expensive, but how do you feel if you come on something anniversary? I think that it will be unforgettable memories.

It was our first Michelin restaurant experience, and we were blown away by the ambience of understated elegance, the ever-attentive service, and the out-of-this-world delicious Greek-inspired food. There were about twelve delicious courses with a capstone course of fall-off-the-bone, perfectly flavored lamb, home-made pita bread, and incredible sauces. We chose to invest in the wine pairings and did not regret this decision. Their sommelier, Kyle, did an excellent job of telling the stories behind each wine. We experienced a spectrum of wine, from dry, fruity whites to apple cider to earthy, volcanic reds from France, Greece, and Italy. It was an unparalleled experience! Five stars.",

You will taste the salt, the truffle, the Rooibos, the Chamomile, the mint, the honey, and all the other flavors served to you. The staff is well trained, professional and friendly. The place is immaculate and has a nice understated atmosphere. If you can get past the sticker shock, it is a wonderful culinary experience.

Great for any sort of special occasion or if you are looking for an authentic yet different experience of Greek cuisine.",

The dishes are consistent with a Greek-ish theme but are so creative and unique that it's a little difficult to put them into any category beyond high cuisine. The set menu provides many many dishes that arrive in quick succession. Each is a small bite or two until you get to the larger main course (normally a protein like the delicious pork chop we received the night we went) but everything is creative and delicious. I also very much recommend going for the wine pairings. The sommelier is excellent with a vast knowledge of not only where the wine presented to you at the moment is from and it's qualities but also why it complements the current or coming dish. There is a ton of action at this dinner with new courses and pair wines constantly coming your way. There is plenty of time to enjoy both but it is also easy to have paired wines stack up if you get lost in conversation. The only downside to Komi is the price but it's so much the experience and the fine food that I could justify a visit once every few years. Highly recommend for those who can afford it and enjoy the creativity and adventure of high cuisine.",

It was so much fun letting them surprise us with different things we would have never tried on our own. My husband has had stomach surgery so he cant eat a lot at once. It was perfect how they spread out many courses small portions and each got better and better! I didn't know what to expect by the reviews of people saying it was an \"event\". But that was a great way to describe it. I was a culinary event worth the money! we got there at 6 and dint leave til around 9 -930. We chose the wine pairing to go with each dish. The second we walked in, they wished us a Happy Anniversary and when we left they wrote Happy 27th Anniversary on a cute little box that had our dessert in it.  It was so much fun and the food was fantastic! The waiters and waitresses were not stuffy, but full of personality and knowledge. Cant say enough about this experience.We had never been to anything like it. Its a very small place and you need to call weeks in advance to get a reservation. And getting an early reservation worked out perfect because it takes several hours. We enjoyed it so much I want to  go back to DC just to  go there again.

They have interesting and pretty long line of small tasting menu appetizers, 2 small dishes of different great pasta after and pretty big main course. They really care if you are starved because they are ready to bring you more main course for free if you want. Wine paring was good, a bit monotonous cause it was 1 sort of wine to two dishes, but for $70 for wine paring it's good, especially when sommelier is eager to refill your glass every time it's empty. Service was amazing. Thank you, guys!",

Our reservation was for 9:15.  We were seated immediately...and by 9:18...we were sipping champagne and enjoying the first course.  If you're in a hurry...this isn't the place for you.  We were there for more than three incredible hours...savoring one surprise after another! Multiple courses (we lost count!) and each one delivered a \"Wow!\" From Komi staples like the olive oil date...to a home run main course of goat shoulder with pita bread and a dish featuring 5 different accompaniments. I've never had goat prior to my dinner at Komi...and it was awesome!  A nice outer crust and delicate and tender meat all the way through.  We opted for the wine paring...and our glassed were never empty.  The sommelier is not stingy with his choices...and quick to offer an alternative if he senses that you're not enjoying the wine. The wait staff was super-friendly...very attentive...and seemed genuinely excited to present each dish and curious to know if we enjoyed the offerings. When I informed someone on staff that I'd have to interrupt service for a few minutes to retrieve my vehicle...which was parked in a nearby garage that was about to close...I was told to relax and not worry.  At the end of the night...the same gentleman escorted us from the restaurant to the parking garage...where he produced a key card that got us in to get our car.  We'll definitely return...and we'll eagerly recommend Komi to our friends...and anyone else seeking a genuinely special dining experience in Washington.",
