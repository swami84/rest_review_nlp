Yes and no, distinctive differences, but I was blown away by the Kabet Lamb and Biryani rice.  I overstuffed myself and would have been miserable for it, but it was so incredibly good I don't regret it at all.  This place has been my best dining experience in Hawaii yet.  I highly recommend it if you are a fan of bold and unique flavors.  We will be back here a few more times during out stay here.  Every one of our party of five was raving about how good lunch was.  We are all experienced world travelers, but this is one of my top favorite dining experiences.  The restaurant is clean and have expect staff.  Not pretentious or haughty, just wonderful people bringing a sliver of their culture for us to appreciate.",

It was very busy with all seats taken, multiple private parties going on and patrons waiting outside to be seated.  However, with a downtown location, I would expect the staff and servers to be used to this kind of busyness. Bad service - Our server was not friendly, seemed irritated when taking our order like we were an inconvenience, 1 main dish and 3 side dishes came when we were done eating.  How can it take THAT long to bring out a bowl a rice and 2 plates of bread?  We had 4 couples in our party so we asked to split the check...it was a MESS.  The alcoholic drinks were split among all the checks, 1 beer was split 4 ways, each check was charged $1.50...huh??!  At first they didn't want to correct it but finally did.  My water was never refilled after asking 2x.  Our original server hardly serviced our table, other servers ended up covering for her. I would go back but request not to have the same server.",

        "caption": "Dined here on a Saturday night. S-L-O-W-E-S-T service in the whole wide world. We sat at one of the high tables but had to move because the table was so wobbly, it was impossible to eat. We moved to the bar hoping service might be faster, but wrong. The bartender was so S-L-O-W, an amateur. He looked so stressed, wiping sweat from his face and head. I ordered a martini and my partner ordered a beer. The slow bartender commented \"if only everyone orders this (beer)...\" as he placed the tap glass on the counter. What a mess. We waited, and waited, and waited.  I thought it was the other way around, that you, the WAITer and WAITress should WAIT on us? Otherwise, I could have stayed home. We had to wait for the bartender to take our orders, each time. Did not follow-up on whether our food was okay, did not follow-up on our drinks if we want anymore, water glass sitting empty for a while, and no question on whether we needed anything else. We had to flag him each time, for another tap of beer, for some napkins, for anything else. The woman who gave us our first dish said \"sorry about the wait\". We asked her for hot sauce, she said the hot sauce is right there pointing at a red sauce included with our noodle dish. No, we had to clarify for the hot peppers in a jar. Why waste our time to make your sarcastic point - duh there is a hot sauce there - but you knew we were asking for a condiment hot sauce, not the noodle sauce that actually came with the dish. The same woman later came to the bar to look at the order monitor in front of us, then we asked a waiter and the bartender for our check. They kept us waiting. Mind you, we were at the bar right in front of the bartender. He can directly observe us, whether we were done with a dish, needed a water refill or napkins, or wanted to order some more from the menu. I suggest for any staff here to be more observant of their customers, who pay them to keep this business running. How can we be in front of you and you still did not know what we need? I complained that we have been waiting, and the stupid woman, who kept saying the same thing for at least the past two hours, again said 'sorry about the wait'. ENOUGH F--- SORRY IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FIX IT. We did more waiting on the wait staff than actual eating. We took our food home because we were ignored, and it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I will not return to this restaurant. I will be in Yangon next month to have the real deal. The bartender did not even say thank you when we left. The woman also did not do anything else. Inferior customer service as compared to any restaurant in downtown. We have dined at almost every restaurant in downtown where the service had always been exquisite. With so many other downtown restaurants competing for your business, the Rangoon Burmese Kitchen is the worst in the area. What's up? Your poor service might be acceptable at restaurants in Yangon, but hello, this is NOT Yangon. Both the Caucasian bartender and waiter and both the Asian waitress and waiter seem to especially favor certain customers by a race which, really is not a biggie to me until you treat me with the poorest customer service, then it becomes personal. Good luck with that mentality in Hawaii where diversity is prevalent. Lastly, the dining room was very loud. It was just so nice and peaceful to walk out of there and turn my back away from the mediocrity. Shame on you for making us pay for your bad service and ruining a date night.",

The Brussel Sprouts with Dried Fish appetizer was probably my favorite choice that day, although the Burmese Fish Curry was also a standout. What most impressed our party was the fact that we arrived 20 minutes before the 2:00 closing of lunch hours, yet the service was excellent and we were not rushed by the staff. Atmosphere is vogue and comfortable, welcoming to professionals on lunch break, families, locals and visitors alike.",

A great appetizer to start and perfect for two couples (4 pieces) or a couple with a very hungry person.  We also had the lemongrass prawns which was cooked to perfection. The girls weren't impressed by the \"head on\" presentation but that just meant extra for me.  The brussel sprouts are also a must have dish but avoid the Thai Peppers unless you can handle the heat.  The Rangoon Tea Leaf salad was just an okay dish to me - nothing special.  My highlight of this dinner was the Kachin Whole Fish Wrapped in Banana Leaf. Whole Moi and Warabi shoots wrapped and baked in Banana Leaf that just melted in your mouth. Definitely will order this again.  Always a great meal with great food at reasonable cost.",

The results were mixed but this place has great potential The samosas were crisp and flavoursome and came with a delicious sour dipping sauce Likewise the Burmese slow cooked curries, we had both pork and beef, were delicious. The meat meltingly soft and the sauce deep with flavour. Unfortunately the other half of the meal was bland at best. The chicken Shan noodles dish lacked any defining flavours or real texture. Likewise the whole baked fish was the worst Asian steamed fish I\u2019ve tasted - both mushy and tasteless",

My suggestions: Mashed Potato Salad, Sour Tea Leaf Salad, and Coconut Curry Lamb. It\u2019s BYOB, so I brought a Prosecco that paired very well with all of it!",
