My husband and I each had 2 cocktails.  They were well balanced and creative.  We started with the ceviche, which was small but delicious and a great way to open up our palettes.    We then had the prawn heads---- we had never had anything like it before, so it was a novelty, but they were good and the sauce was delicious.  I needed the bread service for the sauce!  We had the beets with goat cheese next, which was underwhelming and standard... it wasn't bad, just didn't knock us out.  This was followed by their specialty, which was the scallops.  They were big, buttery, and out of control delicious, and priced well.  A highlight for sure.  We finished with the braised beef.  It was super oniony but tender and delicious.  Definitely heavy.  We also had the basque cake which was great, but could have used some cream or ice cream.  The bill was $160 ($180 with tax) so it was not cheap, but it was so good and service was on point, so we did not mind at all.  I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 because the restaurant was SO HOT.  When I went to the bathroom, it was 20 degrees hotter in there.  We were sitting right by the kitchen, but our server told us there is poor ventilation and it's also uncomfortable in the summer.  I would definitely recommend the restaurant, but advise people to layer in a way that makes taking off layers doable!  We will return.",

The staff was attentive and friendly, so also no complaints there. Unfortunately it was incredibly hot in the restaurant and it was hard to focus on anything else. It wasn\u2019t just us to notice it- the table next to us complained as well. If there was an issue with the ac we would have appreciated a heads up in advance and come back at a different time. If that\u2019s how it always is, they should really look into getting that fixed. The dishes we ordered we fine, but the shellfish/pork/noodles at the end was way too heavy of a meal to enjoy in the heat, which was really unfortunate because it smelled delicious. We had plans to go out after dinner but we were too hot and sweaty afterwards and the whole thing just put a buzzkill on the night. For those price points we had expected a much more comfortable dining experience.",

I've walked past numerous times, so I was very surprised they'd get a nod from Michelin.  Get a reservation, it's small and busy.  I was surprised by the fresh and seaside decor, I didn't expect much at all before arriving.  The space is well adorned and pleasant.   Our server was very friendly and helpful in recommending favorites.  The Basque inspired small plates were all amazing.  We were delighted and surprised by each one.  We started with the mussels escabeche followed by an anchovy special.  After our smoked trout toast, there was a pause.   We didn't much notice, but our server came to apologize for the delay with another of the specials, fried avocado.  Everything had been so delicious, we certainly did not mind waiting for the next course.  The consideration of the kitchen was much appreciated.  The star of our evening was the tortilla espanola.  Having lived in Spain, I thought I knew what we were getting.  By the way, I love tortilla.  This was so different.  mfk. chefs reinvented tortilla.  It is so light, fluffy, and dreamy.  After two bites of the tortilla, I said, \"wow, I could not make this at home.\"  Couldn't recommend mfk. enough!",

We wanted to have a quiet, convivial evening in a cozy restaurant with good food to enjoy our getting together again. The evening started off really enjoyably, we discussed the excellent one-woman play about racism \u201cUntil the Flood\u201d which we had seen the night before. We talked about family, the state of the US economy, the imposition of trade tariffs and, of course, the news about what was going on related to the White House drama. Out of the blue the bar manager, who had been hovering, came to our table and announced aggressively that \u201ctalking about politics and religion is not permitted in this restaurant\u201d. On questioning he repeated the statement. This unexpected intrusion into our private sphere spoilt what had so far been a pleasant evening. We cannot recommend this restaurant in which the management listens in on and censors the conversations of its patrons.",

Spicing was excellent; reminded me somewhat of basque style cooking/pinxtos.",

The rest of the meal was satisfying and right on but i won\u2019t bore you with the details. This place feels special, with an intimacy born from its small basement-level space and a barmaid and bartender so low-key and friendly that they felt like inconspicuous old friends.

The servers are very good and helpful and they have great drinks. I tried the Flight of the Opera and found it interesting and well mixed. We ordered the fried avocado, the speck fritters and the scallops with grits. Overall, the food was tasty, with an eye for detail and flavors. I didnt like the avocado as much but I did like the speck and the sauce/ dip it comes with and I would always get the scallops here. I will try more seafood if Im back. Prices are a little high but its good quality food. Just dont expect a quiet evening :)",

Both the food and drink menus are concise and delicious; certainly on-par or better than most restaurants in the area.  The menu is seasonal and includes fresh seafood-based dishes.  There are also adorable, season-appropriate drinks.  For example, last summer they served a drink for two in a copper pineapple.. and the drink was on fire (literally flaming).  Where this restaurant has everything else beat is ambiance.  MFK makes superb use of its intimate, garden-level space.  There are a handful of tables in the entire restaurant and less than 20 bar-seats, almost small enough to give the feeling that you are at a dinner party.  There is frequent banter between tables and it makes for a fun atmosphere.  Music selection is deliberate and unexpected the last weekend they played Beck's Midnight Vulture album in it's entirety.  The time before that Sky Ferreira's Night Time, My Time... in it's entirety.  Volume level of both ambient noise and music is kept in check, and unlike most restaurants, you can actually hear what people are saying.  Never been disappointed.",

Thoughtfully crafted cocktails and wine selection complement the cuisine, as does the knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Two things of note if you've never been here:  1) Certain dishes do take longer than others (roasting a half-chicken is NOT a quick process, folks) so order accordingly, then order a drink and relax. It's all worth the wait.  2) Make a reservation, especially if you are coming in a group larger than two, as the space is very small \u2014 they are often solidly booked (yes, even on Mondays) \u2014 and the bar, which is quite comfortable and runs adjacent to the table area, is likely the only way you're going to get a seat if you DIDN'T make a reservation.  The menu has just enough options, in my opinion \u2014 there are some vegetarian choices and also a few meat dishes for you hardcore carnivores, but everything else features fish/seafood (the ceviche and boquerones are both exquisite). Most of the menu items are smaller plates, so you can try things you might not otherwise. I've never been disappointed here, only impressed.",

We were seated right away at the bar with no reservation. It was too crowded and too loud for a Chicago dinner. (Srsly... half of Dan the wine supplier's ass was on my barstool, but he and Kate made good on it by giving some awesome food recs in town).  Around 8pm a huuuge party rolled in and the volume just escalated to beyond unpleasant... since everyone now had to yell to be heard.  Food was okay. The standouts were the tempura avocado, and the 1/2 lb skewered shrimp. We also tried ceviche, fregola, boquerones... which were all so-so. Service was confused and disorganized,  but im sure as its a new place theyll get it together soon.  I would try this place again if im in the area and if they take out a few place settings so that im not eating off my neighbor's plate or hearing about how hairy Jeff's back was. Fantabulous craft beer bar across the street!",
