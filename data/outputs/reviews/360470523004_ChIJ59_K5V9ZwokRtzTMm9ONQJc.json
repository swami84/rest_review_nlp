Not their fault, they were actually nice and communicative about it, and even offered us to pick up the food ourselves for free, but we had to quarantine, so we didn\u2019t. So the following Friday we got a ride there from Bed Stuy, to order pick up. We waited outside for over 35min for our order, but sadly the flavor wasn\u2019t there at all. We ordered two Caribe burgers (comes with avocado, some mango sauce, fried plantains and grilled white cheese; on a black bun). The burgers were flavorless and dry, even the one that was cooked medium! You couldn\u2019t taste any of the special ingredients. At least the hand cut fries tasted good, even though they were soggy. We also got an order of mozzarella sticks and all the cheese had leaked out of the sticks, it was all melted at the bottom of the container.  And to top all of that, when we finally picked up the food, the server gave us one bag, we asked if the whole order was there and he said yes. Since it was a small bag, we decided to check it while still at the restaurant. Turns out half of the order was missing, and that\u2019s when the server realized it and came back saying he was still waiting for the rest. Sorry, Juanchis, we really tried.",

I watched this waitress take multiple people\u2019s cards throughout my time eating at the restaurant. She gave the bill, they presented the card, and they were done.  When she came to me, i presented an AMEX. Immediately she asked me whose card it was and to identify if it was mine. Why Diana? Was it because i was a young black girl with a gold amex? Does that look suspicious? Why didn\u2019t you ask any of the other patrons to verify their card?  Steaming, i paid and left.  In this new \u201cwoke\u201d era you would expect people to be more aware of how they speak to people of ALL skin tones and how it is perceived.  Needless to say, im disappointed and wont be returning. I mean your in Brooklyn, how can you afford to NOT be woke.  Maybe she will be more aware of how she treats patrons of color, as my party was the most colorful table there.",

I scrolled through the menu on the way over and looked at all the 300+ pictures and still couldn't make up my mind. We arrived right at opening at 430pm as they were seating up. Decor very hipster minimalist. We were the only ones eating indoors, listening to their 90s grudge playlist.  Drinks: -Started out the MimosaBerry. Very sweet and refreshing -Red Love Sangria. Solid flavor, tangy aftertaste  The real stuff: I was undecided between the Spanish Queen and the Psychedelic Swiss. Our waiter voted hands down for the latter. I really liked how you could add any sides to an existing burger so I added avocado slices to the Psychedelic Swiss. Ordered my patty medium. When it arrived, it was beautiful sight. Just amazing!!! The combo of the JB beef patty, grilled mushrooms with the swiss cheese was really something else. The sauces, man they need their own paragraph. I liked the Tarragon that came with my burger as well as the BBQ and the capers. The fries were also crispy and delicious. The hubs ordered the New Aged with aged beef and short rib blend, double caramelized onions and 3 cheeses. It felt even bigger than mines with lots of bold flavors. Still preferred the simplicity of the Swiss over it.  Overall, this place is really an elevated burger experience. And they offer such great varieties, I'm already tempted to come back for the Spanish Queen or the Caribe.",

However the service we had at this place was the worst I have ever experienced.. literally nothing close to it! Came here with my husband and two children for starters the waiter we had tonight was in limbo land.. Im guessing this place doesn't give any water to the patrons we were all parched and so we just ordered strawberry lemonades for all four of us. NO napkins were given also considering this place is a finger food friendly place you would think there would at the least be napkins at the table or given to you. Then we received three wrong drinks, to me it was very simple \"3 strawberry lemonades\" ... then we put in three orders of burgers and chiken tenders with fries.. food came out and we only got two burgers! When we notified him of the mistake he said we only ordered two when it was clearly four of us at the table and he is the one who suggested the burger with fried egg for my son. I thought it wasn't a big deal even though our drinks were wrong and he failed to order our third meal.. everyone has an off day right.. Yeah right!!! We had hot wings and not a napkin in sight... sheesh, so my husband asked him for napkins.. about 10 minutes later I see my waiter cleaning up and putting things away for the night and at this point I was livid \"CAN WE PLEASE GET SOME NAPKINS!!!!!!!!\" As I said earlier everyone has an off day so we definitely tipped him however the thing that made me write this review is that our waiter didn't apologize AT ALL for anything. It was literally a slap in our face we were so understanding the most I would expect is an apology.. So the food: Great tasting, awesome  and juicy burgers just what I expected.. But the service just took my appetite away we wrapped everything and took it to go.. If your a person who likes to feel welcomed and taken care of where you spend your money to eat don't come here! Maybe he is new maybe it was just a really bad day for him either way this was the worst service I have ever experienced!",

Beautifully cooked good quality beef combined with caramalized onions and bacon give a sweet and salty flavour profile that works well. The combination of the curry sauce and the bbq sauce sounds strange but trust me its fantastic. The bun is a perfectly toasted brioche style with the Juanchi's branding on the bun which I absolutely love. Definitely one of the best burgers if not the best burger I've had in New York so far. I also ordered the truffle fries which were tasty but they came in a pomme frite style and I just happen to prefer a thicker cut. Still great though.  Decor/Ambiance - This place is really cool with old style mixed matched furniture. They had stepbrothers on the projector which happens to be one of my favourite movies.  Now for the bad stuff...  Service - It's probably a bit too slow. I understand the vibe is a chilled one but that doesn't mean you can relax as servers. Took them 10 minutes to seat us even though there were spots available. The server was nice and just trying to be chatty and jokey but we were in a rush to catch a movie so I wasn't so appreciative. He also took a tables order that were sat after us which was a bit irritating. Then at the end I was waiting around 10-15 just to pay the bill.  Overall the quality of the burgers outweigh any other bad experience and I can't wait to go back to try more menu items. I would give it 5 stars but the service wasn't great.",

First, I ordered 2 black bun chicken sandwiches with honey, lettuce, tomato, cheese, avocado, and fries. When I received my sandwiches, they were simply dry chicken with poorly melted cheese, dressed in a stale, plastic-like, black bun. No lettuce, no tomato, no avocado. I had to ask for them on a separate plate.  After I got the lack of toppings resolved, as I bit into the bun, there was a lack of flavor. The chicken was dry, and the bun, as suspected, felt and looked like styrofoam. From my experience, the black bun in Miami, FL has a better texture, and it tastes like...bread.  However, I was greatly impressed by the sweet potato fries and the serving sizes. My side order was greatly appreciated. The cut of the sweet potato fries were thick and very flavorful, fried to perfection.  In addition, our sever Garrett was very attentive and patient, grabbing my partner and I everything we needed.  I suggest to management to visit the Miami, FL location and take notes. They\u2019re doing everything right down there, and it would greatly improve the business of this establishment in Brooklyn. I have yet to take a trip to the location in Spain.",

Today was that day,  and I brought some girlfriends along with me on the adventure. Sadly, my taste buds felt let down, as the anticipated flavor explosion I expected was not experienced. I ordered the \"Caribe\" burger which came with a side of sweet potato fries (thumbs up on those fries though). My burger was prepared medium well which was great but lacked taste even with the added layers that dressed the meat. I'd reccomend their strawberry lemonade it's super delicious especially on hot day like today. The place it self is really cute and the staff were very pleasant.",

My food was satisfactory, but since I had miles better burger and chips. The black and brown bread tastes neither in the positive nor in the negative somehow special and the only wish, no tomatoes, was not fulfilled - had one of these reddish water bombs (November - probably no tomato time). Overall, I can not understand the good reviews based on my experience.  (Original) Habe bestellt und abgeholt, kann also zum Restaurant an sich nur sagen das es recht leer war zu dem Zeitpunkt aber nett aussah. Mein Essen war zufriedenstellend, aber da hatte ich schon um meilen bessere burger und pommes.

A friendly smile really makes even a bad meal great. Kudos to the staff. Now the food, the burgers and fries were exactly what you want and it\u2019s not small so you leave full. The caribe and Spanish queen are the only way to go. Personally I think the regular fries were best. We also tried the tequenos, think mozzarella stick but with a wonton wrapper outside, delicious dipping sauce. But in my heart, I still like traditional mozz sticks.  I almost forgot, they have a nice selection of sauces, most importantly flavored mayos! Makes each fry all the better.",

The music was mostly 90s hip hop and R&B.  * Food *  Appetizers: The chicken wings and arepas were like something you'd get at a bar that's not known for their food. The wings were quite dry, and the mini arepas just didn't really taste like arepas-- they were more like hush puppies. Not bad, but not good either.  Burgers: We tried a few different burgers and some sliders. We asked for some to be cooked medium and some to be cooked medium rare. None of them were juicy and the meat had hard pieces of gristle in them that are normally present in lesser quality meat. Finally, one of the sliders was presented with a sloppy glob of sauce covering the burger. Presentation does not affect taste, but this showed the kitchen doesn't really care.  Fries: The fries were the worst thing here. If it wasn't for the sauces, the fries would not have been eaten, which brings me to my last food section...  Sauces: We all appreciated the variety of sauces, but most of them were average at best. If you've been to Wendy's, then you've had Juanchi's BBQ sauce and Sweet Mustard sauce. However, both the creamy verde sauce that came with the arepas and the curry sauce were quite good.  * Service *  Wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. The staff was nice, but it took a while to get our food, appetizers came out at different times, and one burger came out missing cheese which caused a further delay.  There are better places to grab a burger in the area. Emmy Squared is right down the street and Dumont Burger is always a classic.",
