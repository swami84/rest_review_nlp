I love One Piece so I convinced my roommate to check it out. We ordered for pick up. It was ready when we got there and contactless pick up was a bit awkward but easy enough. The restaurant has a big One Piece mural on the outside so it was worth the trip! I can't wait to dine in [eventually \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb]. The food was good! Coconut shrimp and all of the sushi rolls we had were delicious! We guessed on two specials and were pleased (We googled roll names and hoped for the best!)

They gave us double the food than a normal restaurant does! Double the egg, double the pork, double the fish cakes. Also, the broth was very savory.  The salmon hand roll was also very delicious, the fish was fresh.  The beef tongue and chicken gizzard skewers were very good.  The fried oysters AND the saury fish were one of the most delicious! It was very very tasty!  Not included in the picture were garlic chicken wings. Those were very good, crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside.  This place was amazing, will definitely come again.",

While the pieces in the sushi set look small they are flavorful and actually quite filling. I thought I may need to order more but in the end I didn't have too. The slightly grilled sushi were not fully cooked so they still have that 'melt-in-mouth' impacts. They gave a bit of everything too, like tuna, shrimp, squid, saba, salmon, red clam, avocado (surprisingly good!), etc. Taste fresh too! The music is more underground type, which is more suitable for young ppl to come hangout with friends. If you are seeking the quiet Japanese feel, this place is probably not for you (well but you could expect that from the One Piece theme interior). Overall a nice place for the bucks.",

The topping tastes good, just like regular ramen topping. The chashu is little chewy, it doesn't really melt in your mouth. However, it tastes good overall. The Atka Mackeral tastes little salty.  In my overall experience, I would give it 3 stars, but before I left. The staff said, \"if it is not good, we will make it again.\" To me, it is a very good attitude toward their food and customers. Hence, I give it 4 stars.",

I ordered a chicken teriyaki lunch bento and a pork ramen. The chasiu for the pork ramen was much too fatty and the ramen noodles felt a little undercooked. I wouldn't recommend it unless you had a severe ramen craving that had to be satisfied. The chicken teriyaki bento was alright but for $9.50 I think I could get more and better at other Japanese restaurants in the area. However, on the plus side, the decor was nice and the service was okay.",
