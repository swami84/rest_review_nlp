        "caption": "In summary: Meh. So I ordered five items on a Whim just killing some time awaiting a friend. Bok Choy w/hoisin: 1/5 as it was not actually served or cooked with hoisin, just steamed with butter/soy flavor. Fresh Summer rolls: 4/5, they were fresh indeed, but the sauce was pretty bland. All in all I enjoyed the roll sauceless. Calimari: 4/5, delicious, fresh but unfortunately served with a plain butter sauce which was odd. 2 Whisky & gingers: 5/5 fairly easy to not mess up. All in all, save your money and order from somewhere else. The service was very abrupt and didn\u2019t check on us at all, we had to call the restaurant from outside to request what we wanted tableside. Ambience is nice so 3/5 is fair, but food wasn\u2019t amazing.",
