I noticed a family with young children dinning there which lead me to believe this is a family friendly spot. I honestly would not bring small children to the location because of how close together the tables are and you have no control on how people express themselves. Again, personal preference. The food was ok and the drinks were decent. I had the churrito drink, way too sweet for my taste, the person who joined me at La Mejikacana had the \"old style\" version made with Mezcal, a decent drink.

To start, I enjoyed one of the handmade drinks...the Pilsen Jamaica (I believe that was the name, definitely had Jamaica in it). It was delicious and strong. For my meal, I ended up getting some queso fundido with chorizo. I wish there was a bit more chorizo served with the dish. The cheese overpowered it a bit. I'm a huge fundido fan and it was a bit too much cheese for me and not enough meat. Tacos wise, I tried the charrito which is one of their most popular along with the carne asada. Carne asada was my fav. It had a hint of spice that I absolutely loved. I also ordered a side of rice and beans that were pretty good as well.  Overall, the experience was decent. I wasn't raving about it, but I also didn't hate it.  And just a little sidenote: the kitchen closes at 10:30 on weekdays (not sure if it's the same for weekends). So I'm glad I got there early enough to order some food.",

The chips were nice and crunchy. We got the elote with lime and chili which was delicious. We ordered the carne asada taco, pescado taco and the al pastor. My favorite was the pescado taco. The cod was perfectly fried and the sauce that was poured on top was a perfect balance between spicy and sweet.

Entre: I forgot what the name of the entire was but it said it had Chile de \u00c1rbol con Nuez sauce. I know this chile to be super spicy with a hint of maybe peanut butter, but my sandwich tasted nothing like it. I had to ask for more of the sauce. When it arrived, I grabbed a chip and it still did not taste spicy at all. My friend also agreed that it was not spicy.

I had a charro taco, the meat was seasoned very well and the taste was good, dunno if it\u2019s 3.50 worth.  We also had the cemita de al pastor, I didn\u2019t look in the kitchen to see if they had an actual trompo de carne like they should. The cemita/torta was ok.  I had the alpastor, they came with a sprinkle of pi\u00f1a on top. But this tasted to vinegary for me. It still had the typical hot wing sauce taste.  Service was quick and prompt and very attentive.",

As soon as you walk in you feel the latino vibe with the great music that ranged from salsa, bachata and cumbia. I felt like I was dancing in my seat. I was greeted by a beautiful and friendly server Andrea I believe her name was that recommended and explained the menu thoroughly. It\u2019s a great place to start you night and get a quick bite.  My friend order some drinks and loved it.  I ordered some chicken tacos that were far by non some of the most delicious tacos I hade I my life. I appreciated that they weren\u2019t your traditional tacos and were healthy with very good ingredients you can tell the owners put a Lot work into their Menu that is   unique and savory dripping of flavor from the guacamole to the chicken tacos. Pilsen needs more restaurants like this owners and staff that are wonderful.  I still till today can\u2019t wait till I\u2019m back in the area so I can try the rest of their menu.",
