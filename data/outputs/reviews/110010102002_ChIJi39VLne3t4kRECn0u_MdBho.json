And it was every bit as beautiful as the picture when it arrived. And it was every bit worth the price.  Except I kinda wish I'd had an extra piece of toast to top it off. But then it couldn't have been as beautiful. Magnificent. Amazing salmon. Exceptional ingredients overall. Big wow. Will order again.",

Our drinks, a blue majik and a purple heart, were perfect and amazingly tasty. I highly reccomend this spot for anyone who needs breakfast. Wait times were decent, and it was worth the slightly higher prices. Delicious, and tasty goodness.",

It was a big, filling breakfast. The flavors were well balanced. The staff is friendly and helpful with the menu (and directions - I watched the cashier giving directions to help a lost person find their way) My only complaint is the plastic silverware, but that's got nothing to do with the quality of the food.",

The toasts are surprisingly large and filling and packed with fresh ingredients.  The Avocado Smash was bursting with flavor and loaded with veggies - marinated tomatoes, watermelon radish, and greens sitting on top of a chunky avocado spread and soft multi-grain toast. The ingredients  worked well together except for the extra salty hard-boiled egg that I added on. I would just skip the egg!  My hubby enjoyed the fresh Smoked Salmon with poached egg, it was a bit messy though! The board was dripping with egg yolk. Aside from the mess, he relished the toast.  It was difficult to cut the toast with a butterknife and a challenge trying to get all the ingredients into a compact bite. A steak knife would have done the trick!  The cold-pressed juices were tasty and fresh. After sampling a few, I landed on the Orange Turmeric juice made that morning. My hubby got the berry based Superfruit smoothie.  The prices are a bit toasty at $12 for the Avocado Mash and $14 for the Smoked Salmon. As the bread isn't made in-house, I would expect the toast to hover around the $10 range. The $6 cold-pressed juices are a tad expensive - made from frozen fruit in large batches.  Definitely worth trying - sadly the steep prices don't justify coming back.",

Very impressed with how they laid out their space, providing easy order and pickups, while also offering areas to sit down. Our smoothies were well made, flavorful and not overly thick. We also decided to try some toast, go figure. And that is where they set themselves apart. While priced around the same as a large bowl or sandwich, they are all fresh made with plenty of toppings, and are just as hearty as any sandwich. The different flavors offer a lot of choices (I had 3 cheese Italian, very good) which makes for comeback and try more feeling. Definitely recommend trying this place out, even if you're not typically a toast person.",

It\u2019s a pretty small spot, but great for a quick bite. In & out. Lots of healthy options. Fresh ingredients too!!  I had the \u201cAvocado Smash\u201d toast, and we shared a \u201cGreen Machine\u201d smoothie, minus the flax. I think that was the name.  The smoothie was great! I like that hint of banana.  The avocado smash toast was so delicious!! Loved the guac. And the fact that they use sliced watermelon radish is pretty cool. Adds great color. The microgreens salad mix added a nice touch as well.  I\u2019d definitely eat here again... and again.",

From the first day the owners showed up to the Wharf to build their storefront, we became fast friends and mutually respected peers in the community. I was a fan of the owners, Kyle and Brianna, from before they even opened until today. Last Saturday I ordered 2 bowls from this establishment. My wife's bowl was fine but mine had 8 ice cubes in it. We took a picture of it and brought it to the store to show Brianna privately. We had no intentions to make a big deal about it but as she can confirm, we just wanted to show it to her so it doesn't happen again in the future. We even told her we didn't show anyone the pic (until now) as to not bring outside attention to something that could have been rectified easily. Brianna offered 2 replacement bowls and even treated us to try some of their juices. She was humble and kind in a way that all business owners should be. We sat down and then Kyle (the boyfriend co-owner) came out to dispute that these ice cubes ever came from their store. He was upset and standing over our table. I asked him twice to sit down and talk in an effort to not make a big scene. He immediately accused us of taking this pic and falsely adding these ice cubes in order to get FREE bowls! Who thinks like that? My wife and my company IMPACT Collectively can afford to build our own juice bar if we wanted. It's not rocket science. At one time, I had been interested in investing in their business thinking it would be the same caliber and standard of South Block Juice Company but the prices are too high and the service is awful. We have a great relationship with the Wharf community as we live here, have an office here, and also have 5 clients at the SW Waterfront. We did NOT want to start a confrontation and were instantly offended when Kyle insisted that we made all of this up. I don't know where these ice cubes came from Kyle, but they are not from us! Previously, we had mold on our bread which was (again) rectified by someone other than Kyle which didn't apologize for. He was defensive both times. I know this is Kyle (who has a construction background) and Brianna's first ever business venture together but we had hoped they had learned about good customers service. Hey Kyle, do you realize this situation was already resolved at the cost of just 2 bowls? P.S. We left those 2 new bowls that Brianna gave us on the counter because this is a matter of respect and not about eating bowls with ice cubes. Can you imagine that we're all still dealing with this hours after this situation was kindly taken care of? I'm truly disturbed by your rude behavior, especially in front of your customers in which you caused a dramatic scene. I've never seen an owner or manager mishandle a customer and neighbor like that. This could have been prevented and has now been escalated by you and you alone Kyle. See you around the neighborhood.",

They get it from a local woman who makes small batches and it\u2019s frankly better than the Velo cafe\u2019s or Blue Bottle\u2019s cold brew. Both of which are under a 5 minute walk away. Seriously try it. Finally their toast is scrumptious and ... mostly reasonably sized. I\u2019m not a fan that they don\u2019t drop prices if you sub something; you\u2019ll just be paying extra. Which leads me to my only real grumble. This place is EXPENSIVE. You won\u2019t get a juice and a piece of toast for less than $23. I love this place but it is expensive, even for the Wharf.",

I will drive from northern VA to DC at least once (probably more) a week to eat there. Try out their three cheese Italian. You won't regret it.",

The friendly faces behind the counter were so welcoming and helpful in describing the different types of juices and foods they had to offer.
