So naturally I was going to try it especially since I should have received a $10 credit from the hotel toward any purchases. As with most all restaurants attached to a hotel, the prices are typically higher... and food usually is at least decent. Unfortunately I did not get to even try anything from here. I went down at 7:30 PM (signage states they close at 8 PM), bar area was already closed. After waiting a couple minutes for the waitress to come over to me (she was chatting up a table), I said hi and that I wanted to place a Togo order. She tells me they are already closed - did not ask me what I even wanted - whether a drink, dessert, or meal - which I wanted some wings and dessert. I said, I thought you closed at 8 PM - she said they already started closing down and cook was cleaning. I said so your not open until 8PM?  She says well I can check with the cook if he will make it... yeah - no thanks. If your going to close and stop cooking or taking orders at 7:30PM, then that is when your sign should say closed. Not oh we stop cooking but we\u2019re open and you cannot even get drinks or nothing else - since the bar section was closed off as well. Not impressed with that as a traveler just wanting to have a decent meal.  The waitress had a snarky tone when speaking with her. Maybe on a future visit this one star review can be redeemed, best of luck until then.",

The first 2 take as much as 20 minutes to be brought to the table, after that you can order next two.  Eggs runny, bacon covered with liquid bacon grease, waitress surly when asked why did it take so much time.   Size of course, decided at kitchen, so you cannot taste but two, or three dishes as determined by kitchen.  Definitely not worth the money or the effort.",

Located in a boutique hotel along Rte.1 in College Park (hence, the name), we find the place easily.  There is ample parking space behind the hotel.  It is almost one o'clock in the afternoon.  Inside, CPGrill looks quite posh with its cozily lit interior built of dark wood and maroon leather.  It is impressively quiet inside...no loud blaring music, not even \"elevator\" music, and conversations do not necessarily carry over the room.  If it's not wall material good for muted sounds, then it must be the kind of clientele CPGrill attracts.  The crew is a youthful bunch, most likely students from the nearby university.  They are very accommodating and they do serve with enough warmth and friendliness.  The brunch is a long list in the menu which they serve two at a time (per person).  They come in small plates with a good enough amount of serving for three to four mouthfuls each (or, five if one were to eat really daintily).  The delicious food is served hot/warm.  Each dish is really ordinary breakfast fare, but evidently prepared and elevated in their own special way that we truly relish the experience.  Since it is an all-you-can-eat affair, we find out that four rounds (equivalent to eight little plates per person) are enough to last us through supper.  We feel full...but definitely not \"overly full.\"  And, no food is wasted.  The price is reasonable.  We absolutely plan on \"repeats.\"  Highly recommended.",

The food and service was not bad, but it was not that good either (dirty wine glass, service was slow and the food was served warm not hot). If we were at a diner paying diner prices no problem, but a cheese burger was $15, French dip $17 both served with below average fries. Entrees were much more, cheapest appetizers were $8. There was no kids menu, but a very small basic plate of Mac & cheese was $8, apple juice another $5. At most places you could get both for $5. Clearly they are trying to be a upscale grill, they have a nice (but expensive) wine list, and there are some elements of the atmosphere to match (like the bathroom & live jazz), but the booths are uncomfortable and the experience does not match the advertising. Family friendly, but clearly not designed with families in mind, I assume their main customers are people staying at the hotel above, but if you are a local I would not recommend it.",

The artichoke dip appetizer can feed more than two people. The chips it comes with are nice and crispy and lightly salty.  The french dip sandwich was a solid balance of beef, bread, cheese and au jus sauce with a side of fries.  The ahi tuna main dish was also very good with a decent sized slab of tuna on top of a bed of brown rice. The oven roasted brussel sprouts were divine.  Again, good place for a dinner date. 10/10 would recommend.  Cheers!",

I understand being busy, but to flat out, expressly say, \u201csorry but I don\u2019t have time for you; maybe next time \u201c, is wrong. I feel like I was patient and understanding. However I was given my check, and rushed out the door. They took my food before I was finished. I\u2019ve never felt so bad as a customer. If this is the type of service at this establishment, I recommend going somewhere else for a relaxing, non-embarrassing time.",

The food was so good that I ate lunch around 1 pm  and then dinner at 7 pm on the same day. I ordered the wood grilled salmon. I believe its a must if you visit. the dish has some jasmine rice and garlicky mushroom spinach and  of course the grilled salmon. Every part of that dish was delicious. DON'T MISS IT!  I am giving it 4 stars instead of the 5 stars they are entitled to it because of the side dishes. We had three of them: pan seared Brussels sprouts, Mac and Cheese and Jasmine Rice. They were delicious; however, the jasmine rice was really really made up of a tiny portion. So tiny I almost laughed when I saw it coming and on the table while eating the rest of the dishes. It was kinda like a joke, for a second I even thought it was a prank of some sort.  Nonetheless, this super tiny jasmine rice side costed 7$. I think that's ridiculous. If they want to keep it at the same price, I recommend that they at least have to double or even treble the SORRY portion, otherwise they should simply make it cheaper. 4$ is a fair price for that tiny side dish.  All in all, I would absolutely go again and enjoy the meal, atmosphere and the friendly staff but surely I would never ever order jasmine rice!",

Don't order any fish. The place is very nice though. There's live music. The stuff were very professional and nice. They had a nice bar. I'm giving it a 4 for now. I'll keep updating this review. The only thing I can advise for now is that, don't try anything with fish or sea food!",

Also, chicken on pizza was mushy and had gristle in it and what there was not evenly distributed over pizza.  Crust was good.  Hope it was an off night although the place was empty for a Thursday night.  Promised waitress I would come back for a second try.  She says the French dip is really good.  Very good service staff.",
