Their updated safety protocols are on point. I highly recommend the carne asada and enchiladas, and they low key have the best French fries in town!

The service is poor, but the food is decent.  The 1st time I went, I order food out. I asked for chips on the side and they charged me $3.00. I asked if I sat down and ate would I have to pay for chips and salsa, the waiter said not, but your not sitting down. Again Service sucks, but the food is ok.",

Was there with a couple friends one night for a going away get together as they were moving to San Diego. Unbeknownst to me my friends had gone up and given Eric, the manager,  one hundred and fifty dollars for future meals for me. He told them they didn't have gift certificates but he would take care of it. I am a senior on a fixed income- really nice friends to do that for me. A couple of months later they contacted me and we were catching up. They wanted to know if I was enjoying my meals. I had no idea what they were talking about. They blew their lids when they found out Eric had pocketed the money and never told me. He just kept bringing me a check every time I came in. Who does that to a regular customer who brings in business, a low income senior citizen? I was completely blown away not to mentioned very saddened and disappointed. All I can say is I feel sorry for Eric as nothing good can come from that behavior.",

I'm not sure what people are thinking but to me it taste like a mixture of pico de gallo ingredients, no seasonings and a V8.  Tortilla soup was the best/worst of both worlds. The chicken was dry, which I don't understand because the broth and veggies were delicious!  House margarita is mainly water and ice and cheap tequila. It would best you to go for the Patron margarita if you are looking for something a bit stronger and better tasting.  And this may just be me, but bachata and Mexican food don't mix! As a person born in El Salvador, I like my Mexican food with rancheras on the speakers and futbol at the bar. But that may scare the white folk.

So if Prescott is 34.579376 and DC is 38.537066, it means you're at least 6 degrees away from good Mexican food.

From the table for 4 even though we were a party of 5 to the small, never refilling tortilla chip basket which 5 people make disappear in a big hurry. I think it's just policy because my soda was never refilled either. The tamale my wife ordered wasn't much more than formed mush that tasted like, well, mush. My fajita salad had that distinctive 'bag salad' taste and cut and the meat was so chewy I swallowed huge chunks because I simply got bored of trying to chew it and needed to move on. The taco on the kids menu didn't include meat. Read that again, a meatless \"taco\"! It already cost $6 for a kids meatless \"taco\" and they charged extra to put any on. My other son had an adult taco plate and that was $14 for a taco and rice. I am not from here and maybe this is normal for DC but I've had better Mexican food with better service and at a better price from gas stations. But hey! At least it was outrageously expensive",
