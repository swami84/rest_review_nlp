I was initially hesitant to try this place, as the words fried pizza conjured together images of an entire pizza somehow deep-fried, but it turned out to be way better.  The pizza dough is fried, then all of the other ingredients (sauce, cheese, etc.) are placed on the pizza and it is finished off in the oven. This results in a really crispy but not overly heavy crust. It was a lot less oily than expected.  I've tried both the plain (tomato sauce, cheese, basil) and the 'ndjuja which comes with spreadable sausage and Mike's Hot Honey - both were great.  As a huge fan of the standard NY slice, I wouldn't say it's objectively better than your usual, but it is most definitely worth trying.",

They didn't bother to remake the pizza like someone who takes pride in their work and food.  They tossed some pepperoni in the oven to heat it up and the put that on my pizza, so of course none of it is melted with the cheese or cut.  Tasting the pizza, the dough is cooked, raw dough undercooked.  Nothing special hear and for what they charge you get a better value at a $.99 slice place.",

It was goopy and wet and all of the ingredients just slid right off when you picked it up. The meatball was a good flavor and the dough tasted nice but overall the execution  was terrible.  Pizza should me crisp and not wet. We were out shopping and were going to stop off at Fortina the sit down Italian restaurant because we had packages. Instead we decided to take a chance at Forcella because we never had eaten there before.  The pizza here tasted like they fried the dough but microwaved the cheese unto it. Didn't enjoy this meal. It tasted like cheap stadium food. Was better off getting D'Giornos.",

People who don't have a lot will be able to eat two people in one plate. Because of the large amount, I never thought it was expensive. It is unfortunate compared to Italian oven pizza, but I think this is good in New York.

        "caption": "Delicious pizza spot in the DeKalb market. Highlights include freshly made as you order, including the drying of the dough. Nice options including things like prosciutto and hot honey. Affordable in my opinion. One pizza is enough for a meal. Not big enough for gorging like we all like to do on pizza sometimes. We did the pepperoni which was a classic great. The dough being fried makes it light and fluffy and then the through it in the brick oven which crisps it all up and melts the cheese. The prosciutto was nice. Not to hard to check through like prosciutto can sometimes be. A little light on the balsamic for me so ask for extra if you like balsamic. The croquettes were large and the filling flavorful. I would hit them with some salt right as you get them. Overall a solid option in the middle of a ton of options. They're kind of hidden. I think maybe a fried breadstick sample would solidify people's choice to eat here as the fried pizza sign draws them in.",
