I  ordered the beef and chicken teriyaki combo.  They could hardly close the box.  The food was very good.  Since then I have been back and had a few of the different combos.  All were loaded with food and all were good.  What I found surprising was how good the subs are.  I have had a chicken cheesesteak and a regular steak and cheese.  Both were excellent and so were the fries.  All the prices are very fair and a little lower to other local spots.  One thing did seem a little odd.  On the subs they never ask what toppings you want.  Both cheesesteaks came with diced onions and green pepper.  I have no problem with that but some might.  No question it is worth a try.",

The food was on point and super tasty. Staff was friendly and unlike other places actually called me to verify my order instead of guessing and making it wrong. That earned a lot of respect for me.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for amazing teriyaki dish\u2019s.",

I ordered the chicken hibachi while my girlfriend ordered a sushi burrito. Both were amazing and tasted fresh. The chicken hibachi also comes with yum yum sauce that makes it taste even better. Definitely a place that everyone should try!",
