And the fried shrimp was cooked perfectly and included a pineapple Hennessy glaze dipping sauce. While the collards had too many onions for me, that was the one miss in an otherwise divine meal. Everything was well-seasoned with a sneaky amount of spice that tickles your tongue. And did I mention the cheddar biscuits?! I would go back just for the cheddar biscuits. The friendly server brought the food to our car and everything was well-packaged. All and all, one of my favorite accidental finds!",
