I visit this location once or twice a week.  First of all, the staff will be hit or miss. Expect to be treated as if you\u2019re a nuisance if you try to order a not-so-common latte or bowl. Keep in mind that you will have to check the ingredient(s) on the app to compare with the item that you get in order to ensure that it was made correctly - I have had to tell an employee to re-make a smoothie because there was no apple in it. He argued at first but confirmed after looking at the menu and apologized. I appreciated that he apologized. I had to ask an employee to re-make a latte with the sweetener in the recipe (per the app) I was familiar with how it was supposed to taste. I received a dirty look for asking for it to be re-made. I had to go back in to Clean Juice to get a different lid because the lid did not properly fit the latte cup so it spilled all over the place. Fortunately, I was in the parking lot.  Most recently, what encouraged me to write this was how contentious Mariah was on Monday afternoon when I tried to order off the Winter Menu as if it were my fault that it was not prepared. I got a notification from the app that the Winter Menu was available, the sign outside advertised it and the Winter Menu was physically advertised on the lit-up menu inside. Mariah unpleasantly said it was not prepped. She said \u201cnone of us were given any instruction on the Winter Menu.\u201d She said \u201cI can make you a latte because that is pre-made.\u201d I thought it was fresh to order? She was noticeably aggravated. She did not apologize. The owner was nowhere to be found. She had to call the owner for instruction. I tried not to take it personal because she seemed overwhelmed. I did not think it should be demonstrated in her tone or her facial expression. All I simply did was respond to the advertisement by trying to spend money there. I told her that it was advertised on the app and that I got a text message about it. She abruptly tried to make an excuse by being condescending, saying  \u201cwell, yeah, today is the first day\u201d so does that mean that True Food across the street can say \u201cwe have no food prepped, excuse us, it is our first day\u201d?  I write this for the consumer not for the owner to improve. I have mentioned this experience to the owner; However, I live across the street so this is the most convenient place for me to get a nutritional latte.",

Our daughter had to miss school (she's in med school) due to being so ill and had to miss a major exam for which she had been studying for 6 weeks.

        "caption": "I signed up for a 5 day cleanse. To be honest, with work and the gym I shouldve opted for 3 days but you live and learn. Now the results were great. For the past few years my diet has been horrible due to my work schedule. The snowball effect has left me overweight, lazy, low energy, and brain fogged.  By the 3rd day of the juice cleanse, I really noticed an increase in brain activity, clearing up so much of that haze in my mind that I've had for the last 4 years. It motivated to go back to the gym and recharge and organize myself for a healthier lifestyle.  Dont overthink the juices. There are 6 a day. Juice 1 is a Sweet Green juice. May take some getting used to if youve never done green juices but I enjoyed it especially because of the added organic maple for flavoring. Juice 2 is Orange with oranges and carrots and its pretty tasty. Juice 3 is a Green juice but without the added sweet. Its fine. Most of the juices if nice and cold you can chug down in about 2 or 3 gulps if you really cant take the flavor. Juice 4, well Juice for being the exception. Man this was the hardest for me. Its Yellow and its an amazing lemonade with the addition of cayenne pepper flakes. Chugging is not as easy. And towards the end the cayanne builds up. But I liked that this juice deff felt like a cleanse boost and metabolism ignitor. Juice 5 was Red, a Beet inspired juice that was fine. Definitely do not recommend letting this one get cold at all. Then Juice 6, the creme de la creme, White. Its akin to a protein shake as its chasew milk based. It has cinnamon, maple, some Himalayan salt. Man, this thing makes all the other juices worth it. Its fatty, rich, and taste so good. It also makes you just feel rewarded for the day. All ingredients are labeled as organic.  The staff is friendly and helpful. They are open at 7 which helped me pick up my pack each day before work.  The price is going to be high for many people but the it beats a hospital bill. It's an investment on your health especially for those of us who have not given enough care throughout the years and allowed those things to compound. I say give it a try even if its the partial day or 1 day fast!",
