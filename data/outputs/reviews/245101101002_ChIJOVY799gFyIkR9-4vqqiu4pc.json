Found this little spot near our Air BNB. The food was ready upon walking in and smiling faces greeted us. Before we even came, we looked into the webpage which was very informative about the owners and staff, which I appreciated. We ordered a BLT (please add the avocado and chipotle mayo) with fries that were hand cut. My boyfriend enjoyed the B\u2019more omelet. The orange juice was delicious and so was my French vanilla. Everything just bomb! Haven\u2019t gotten to the snickerdoodle cookies yet but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be equally pleased. It was delightful to have an awesome experience amongst the craziness.",

First of all they open at 6am compared to others in the area, so you know the coffee is hot and the smell of fresh baked scones is in the air. From omelettes to breakfast sandwiches to pancakes like mom used to make (with chocolate chips inside) Charmed will charm you the minute you walk in. Come back for lunch too as their menu is full of tasty and filling burgers, sandwiches and more! And best of all the service is top notch from Danae and her team. Speaking of team, this place oozes Baltimore pride. You can't go wrong here. Charmed is here to stay. When you eat here, you'll agree.",

One of the chefs and the bartender allowed me to sample several items without hesitation, and all of the food was delicious and fresh.

The food is always perfectly cooked and quick with fantastic prices and served with a smile! Delicious bakery treats as well, my fave being the chocolate chip cookies. If you are in the area I highly recommend you check it out and say hello to Donna and the rest of the Charmed family who will become like family to you by the end of the meal!",

We met the owner Danae and her Mother who\"s recipes are used at the restaurant. Everyone was so nice and attentive and genuine. My Wife had the breakfast platter with scrambled eggs, sausages, home fries and toast. The sausage patties were really good and the homemade wheat bread was the best we ever had. I ordered the Bourbon Burger. Whew blow your head right off. The homemade Bourbon sauce was perfect, the burger was made with fresh ground beef and the flavor was perfect. The fries were addictive.  I could have a full plate of them alone. This is an intimate space but very well lit especially with the natural light. Feels like an old time Neighborhood spot even though they recently opened. Danae came over to our table to ask us how was everything and we shared with her our thoughts. Told her we would definitely come back and share with our colleagues. We also asked about catering and she followed up with an email to us regarding their catering menu. Overall the experience, the food, the location, and the name, everything is great about Charmed. Keep up the great service and taste and this place will be around a long, long, long, time.",

(I am VERY allergic to tomatoes, and she didn't order that). Instead of giving her what she ordered or a discount, they said \"oh sorry!\" and did not correct the issue. They did remake my sandwich without tomatoes, though it was bland. My friend told me to give it a second chance due to the growing pains of a new establishment.  The second try, I got a burger. Again, ordered without tomatoes. Although the tomatoes did not arrive in the to go box, the kitchen staff was told \"hey I said no tomatoes!\" - I assume they were plucked off as I was sick the entire day afterward. F**king embarrassing.  I could not give a worse review if you have a food allergy. Honestly, if you have a severe allergy, do NOT GO! The cook doesn't give a flying fk. Or if you want your order to be correct. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this place.  F-",
