Thought the health claims meant real fruits/veggies/dairy/sweeteners but turns out it means weird, powdered, artificially flavored junk. Maybe we got an abnormally bad batch (strawberry cheesecake and cookie dough were the flavors) but that\u2019s even worse because we followed their recommendations.

Protein shakes can be dull and chalky tasting but the shakes they offer are great in flavor and smooth. I especially love \"mint to be\" and \"S'mores\".
