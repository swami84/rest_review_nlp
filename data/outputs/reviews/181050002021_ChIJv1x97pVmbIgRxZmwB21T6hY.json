Not Bronx or Brooklyn- but NYC, which arguably has the nicest poke bowls outside of wherever poke bowls are from!(pokeland?\ud83d\ude1b) The bowl was fresh, great portions, they didn\u2019t screw up the order, it was picked up super fast from the restaurant, fish was STILL warm- and the taste was pristine. I gave them a 5 star review on the Uber eats app, however it didn\u2019t allow me to comment. I went out of my way to get on google and tell the restaurant how great the food was. I am only here in Miami on vacation, but I will 100% order from them every time I come down here. Super huge 5 stars for them!",

Then he puts me on hold yet again to figure out what's going on, and 8 minutes later just hangs up the phone. Real professional guys. All I wanted was for someone to bring the sauces or have them ready for me to pick them up since they're only a few blocks away but instead I got an attractive dial tone.

It\u2019s disappointing when a poke bowl is all about the fish and in Hawaii you get huge cubes of fish that match the quantity of rice. Here the taste of fish is overwhelmed by the taste of everything else and the sweet sauce they add. It should be much better, but all in all It\u2019s nice to have a low budget seafood option on the beach. Better off making your own poke at home.",

Monday August 13th around 7:30 pm  I live (literarily) around the corner and since Sushito closed last year i was dying to find a new place for Poke/rice bowl for my lunch and dinner.  So after several months going to fresh market (across the street) I finally  decide to check what could be my new regular place for lunch and dinner only to be welcomed, as i get tot the cashier,  by \"we are closed!\". no Hello, no sorry we are closed , no but please come back....  When i asked for more details for next time it felt like i was asking the world: - Do you deliver? - Do you have a menu i can take with me?  Clearly the person had no interested whatsoever to help or make this very first customer experience enjoyable  Very disappointing as being local i was looking forward to make a regular dinner hangout  Again i cannot speak on the food .

They also have a small market of assorted Japanese goods set up against the wall to the right as you walk in with really good prices.  We ate really well and the ingredients were top notch. We'll definitely be back for another lunch-date and recommend everyone to go here for a bite!  Edit: 4-stars, customer service could really use a tune-up.",
