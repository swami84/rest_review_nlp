We came to Lila Cafe and ordered a sorrel drink, rum punch, oxtail empanadas, and the grilled jerk chicken. Everything was delicious. It wasn't busy but even so the waitress was super nice and attentive. She made me a bomb rum punch. They were out of oxtails but I will definitely try it next time I come. The jerk chicken was spicy and jerky, which I love! The veggie medley was also very delicious as well as the rice. The sauce with the empanadas is bomb too! Will definitely return!",

It\u2019s not worth eating here I won\u2019t recommend  Then I saw the cook who comes out the kitchen, sits at one of the tables where some people are and had a whole conversation for about 30 min having a good ol time A chef never leaves the kitchen.

I\u2019ve been to this establishment for brunch now 3 times and the very last time was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had. My friend and I went to Lila Cafe for brunch on Easter and the food was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I\u2019ve been to this establishment twice before for Sunday brunch and have always been less than impressed but love their drinks and the staff is friendly so I continue to go.  While my friend and I originally were going to order something safe like shrimp and fries, I noticed that they had an Easter menu. I ordered the coconut French Toast and my friend ordered the blueberry waffles. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. My friends Chicken was cooked PERFECTLY! My French Toast was PERFECT! My grits were PERFECT! My eggs were PERFECT! The seasoning on everything was great. I seriously hope that they continue to make brunch the way they did on Easter. Whoever made the food we had obviously loves what they do and simply gets it.  Please please please please please please keep up the great work and don\u2019t let whoever made that Easter brunch leave. I know it sounds ridiculous but it honestly was great and I\u2019ve been thinking about that French Toast all week!",

My food arrived very quickly plus when my friends or family members ordered we are so deep in our conversations and just having a good time we didn\u2019t even realized the food was coming out. I always bring someone when to go to get a taste of the food and enjoy the experience with me. Music and the painting on the wall is just amazing all around. If you haven\u2019t tried Lila\u2019s Cafe please do so you won\u2019t regret it. I travel 45 mins for this food and I will keep going back every chance I get. Five stars across the board.",

The space is a little tight but for wheelchairs I think they may be able to manuver I'm the Cafe. The service is friendly, Monica our server was great. The drinks were Strong but reasonably priced. We went for Brunch, it's a very small but Caribbean themed menu. Everything that we ordered was amazing. The Ackee an Saltfish amazing, the cornmeal porridge amazing, the Steak an eggs mouthwatering goodness. The wait is a little long but it's cool cause you can chat it up with whoever an just relax. There is also a DJ that started up on the tail end of our meal. Also certain foods were a little over salted but still a great meal. I would DEFINETLY put this on my lists of favorite spots.",

I ordered multiple food and drinks and now I'm hoping they will cater an event for me. My only suggestion is that they market and promote because this is one of Brooklyn's best kept secret!",

In total a salad and salmon was $24 not bad by my standards. My part of bedstuy is a food dessert in terms of sit down spots. So to see Lila cafe is very welcoming for my neighborhood. This will be a spot I frequent a lot. I think it\u2019s black owned as well which gives me more an incentive to patronize the place.",

The servers still finding their way, the first time they forgot to ask me what sides I wanted and the second time the server had a lil issue with the timing of the courses. In time I am sure they will get their rhythm. They are very nice.  This place gives me a reason to come to Brooklyn and visit my family more often. \ud83d\ude01",
