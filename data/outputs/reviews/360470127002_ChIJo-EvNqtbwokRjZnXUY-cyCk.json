The move here is to eat in the bar area and order off the normal menu, which is amazing and a much much better deal than the bbq. Great tiki style cocktails as well. Only 4 stars because of the expense and the bbq side will rope people in when it is not what shines here.",

The place insisted that all of us be there for our 8:30pm reservation. Few of us hanged out by the bar. When the time came, they were still able to sit us minus one person.  Drinks:  The most impressive cocktail was the Jade Emperor (we got 4 of them) It was made from Pisco, matcha (not a strong flavor) with a strong cucumber taste. Very refreshing! Eastern Lights were also a hit for those preferring to drink vodka.  Food: We were confused at first about how to proceed. All credit goes to our server Justin who guided each of us with our choices. We all ordered an item for BBQ and shared family style. Food was made tableside with accompanied side dishes. He gave good suggestions. Here is what we loved from the menu:  -THE RIBEYE. It ran for $45. But it was so flavorful, so tender. -Beef Tartare. Surprisingly so so delicious! Probably my favorite dish -Yangnyum Galbi. Beef short rib. A good option after the rib, had a BBQ flavor. -Dolsot Bibimbap with bulgogi. Came in a good portion! -Japchae. Loved the glass noodles! -Samgyeopsal. thinly sliced pork belly. looked like bacon. still good!  Cons: the biggest cons is obviously the price. Our bill came down to a whopping $596. And it's not like I walked out of there with a super full belly. Obviously not an everyday type of place to eat.",

While we convened, another came by and offered a table if we can finish our meal in 1.5 hours. Duh, yes! No one should eat that long in Brooklyn \ud83d\ude06 Our server is great, patience and gave us good tips on portion and dishes to order. We got the squid/octopus bbq and pancetta coreana bbq (all of them are delicious especially the pork belly which are oozing with wonderful lard), japchae (full of flavor) and the kimchi fried rice with bacon (I don\u2019t really like Kim chi but this fried rice is crispy lips smacking). Overall is a great experience and dinner but I do wish the portion can be larger especially the bbq dishes given the prices.",

Booked a reservation for 12 people for a holiday party for 12/11/19 (confirmed on 11/14/19), we had some of our team from California flying out just for the party. They called me on the night of 11/25/19 at 9:15PM probably hoping I wouldn't answer, to tell me they had someone who wanted to do a buyout of the entire restaurant so they had to cancel our reservation. As a fellow business owner, I can't imagine a worse example of customer service.  The worst part is that I found out from a friend that it was their company that did the buy-out and I know that they requested to do the buy-out the day that they canceled my reservation. Meaning a better opportunity came along and the restaurant decided it was a better fiscal decision to screw over all the other reservation holders so they could make a couple of extra bucks.  #sad",

This restaurant has the prices of an upscale restaurant, but honestly, I've had much better food and service at casual Korean barbecue restaurants. The twice fried chicken was the best, but most of the barbecued meat (each around $30-50) was unseasoned and not as much to share as expected. Service was the worst. The servers are kind, but understaffed. The bartender was completely neglectful and we often were waiting upwards to 45 minutes for a beer and would have to go chase down the server to ask again. Overall, I'd say save your money and eat at a casual Korean barbecue place. Food will be the same, or better.",

They have a tiki style bar area that we waited at for rest of our party to show up, as they don't seat until you have your full party.  After being seated and server came to take our order, a few subtle things started to happen. The server proceeded to walk away to attend to another table, halfway when we were making our order and deciding between items.  We ordered their house soju and they gave us a bottle that was 3 quarters finished. We let them know and they didn't even realize and were confused why we wanted to return the bottle, and we had to point it out more clearly to them. Then a different server came by and asked whether there was a problem with the bottle. We were surprised that there was such a lack of communication between the staff, it's clear that it was already drank by a different group before us. We haven't even started eating or drinking yet..  The poor service continued as they gave us an order for a different table. We had to correct them again.  In the end we tried to appreciate the food and drink, but their house made soju was actually disgusting. I'm not really sure what we expected, especially since it wasn't flavored soju or anything.  The meat quality was mediocre. We soon realized that the only reason why people came to this establishment was that they probably live too far from ktown manhanttan - because the price was the same for subpar meat quality.  I highly recommend against coming here if you are able to just go to ktown. This place also requires advanced reservation for weekend nights, I guess since it'd the only kbbq in the entire area.  The karaoke was decent. They have an app you can use for song selection.  Overall I would say if you live in bklyn it's probably an okay choice, but not worth trekking to if you're coming from Manhattan.",

I could find no fault in my dining experience from start to finish, the service was impeccable and amiable. The decor and atmosphere yielded a wonderful experience. A word to the wise though Insa gets busy and quick so come in early or make a reservation if you don't want to wait. But wait you're telling yourself any well-known restaurant will surely cost a pretty penny, worry not the serving sizes are rather large, an appetizer, entree and 2 drinks cost us a mere 40$ a person, making this outing a go to spot for a night out with the fellas. Perfect for dates, celebrations or just to grab dinner at. Finally the food, my god the food was amazing! The reputation of their fried chicken is in-fact understated in my opinion one of the crispiest and most flavorful eats I've had in NYC. Now the BBQ is an absolute blast, the meat is good quality and the Ssam style is so much fun. Seriously get off of google maps and go eat you will not regret it!",

If you\u2019re wondering when the vents are... they\u2019re under the tables. \ud83d\ude09",

BUT they were very kind to inform us they had service at the bar.  I excitedly jumped at the chance. When you first walk in, there's a little window that peaks into the bar/lounge area -- it's red, lush, and visually my aesthetic.  There were a few seats at the side bar, but we were so crazy lucky there was an entire BOOTH open! It feel like a dream, we had skipped the whole line and found this hidden gem. So if it's crowded when you go, seriously see if you can swap to the bar. We skipped a group of five that could have easily fit in the booth.  The bar area is waiterless, but the bar is 2 steps away and the food is delivered to you anyway.  We had the gogi mandu fried, tteokbokki, and bossam.  My favourite was the Gogi Mandu, amazing flavour and just the right level of crispy. Everything was great too. It was nice to go out and enjoy every aspect of the night.  Our cocktails were fabulous, I recommend the Sun&Moon.  It's worth the trek if you're not from the neighbourhood. I would love to come back.",

After 90 minutes we called and the hostess said they had tried calling but it was the wrong number. Okay.. we let that pass and came back for our table. We ordered 3 items from the BBQ section plus an order of pajeon which was the amount the server recommended. The food was tasty but we all left unsatisfied. An order or kalbi is only 2 or 3 pieces for $30. The rice came out halfway through our meal. The banchan (sides) were small and we had to ask for refills. Some of the sides we didn\u2019t get refills on even after asking. Eventually we just ate the meat and rice before it got cold.",

Now, the fish was amazing, the rice was great but very plain. Not much flavour. The reason i gave it two stars is because of those two dishes. However, theBBQ was a disaster. The meat was so thin that the waiter who grilled it overcooked it and it was the most chewiest meat I have ever had! Not only it wasn\u2019t seasoned. But the flavour was horrible. I couldn\u2019t eat it, we leftmost of it on the plate- no oneasked us if it was ok. We left with $116 bill for a less than avarage meal. Won\u2019t becoming back.

Try reading the menu it clearly states that tipping is NOT expected and a %20 fee is charged so they can provide benefits for their staff. We had no problem with that and tipped our waiter anyway which by the way he told us  wasn\u2019t necessary. Would go back again today if I could.  First time trying Korean BBQ and I was not disappointed. One of the best meals of my life! The restaurant it self was very inviting with a view of the kitchen. Even the bathrooms were spotless which might not seem like a big thing but says a lot about the owner and staff. There\u2019s a small but very cozy bar off the dining room with craft beer from the brewery across the street. The IPA was fantastic! Our waiter James did a great job of explaining and preparing the food at the table side BBQ. We were a group of 4 and even after tipping above the %20 that\u2019s added to the bill so they can give the staff medical benefits which we had no problem with it was $100 per person. Considering how much we drank and ate I thought we definitely got our monies worth.",

Why did I just pay $15 for 7 dumplings that are in no way better than a frozen gyoza I could make at home?  Ambience is great and I bet the Karaoke is fun too but also way overpriced compared to what you can find elsewhere in the city.  The restaurant was full of white Brooklynites and tourists who had seemed like they'd never had Korean food before.",

        "caption": "I was so excited to finally have some Korean barbecue, it had been months since I have had any. I'm originally from California and had been looking forever to find a new Korean barbecue place, and when I came across this restaurant I felt like this was the closest place I could find to back home. So, when the friendly Hostess greeted me I was uber excited to be there. But, then the waitress came and that's where it all went downhill. I told her I wanted to use the grill in front of me and that I would like some bulgogi and we briefly discussed what other food could be put on the grill, and we came to the conclusion  of me ordering the bulgogi she then placed my order, what took like it seemed forever to get to me. It turned out that they don't serve bulgogi Raw, it is cooked and is served to you that way. I was highly disappointed due to the fact that the only reason I went there was to use the grill to cook meat and have the total experience. This was something I told the hostess in excitement and my waitress. It quite frankly seems to me that the waitress just was not even really paying attention to anything I was saying and when my food got to me it turns out I was right. She, asked me if I would like a drink and I agreed that yes I would like another drink. After waiting 15 minutes with no drink to arrive, she then returned to me and said, \"are we done, would you like your receipt?\" I  couldn't help but look at her dumbfounded and think to myself, you haven't even checked on me at all! Now, that you see I'm done with my food, now you ask if I want to drink then when I say I do you don't even bring it, it seemed at the time she was avoiding me after I got my meal. Knowing that it wasn't the way I had originally requested it, and when she did bring me my food, and it came to me cook and I asked her why. She tried telling me that she told me I couldn't cook it on the grill, that was a complete lie. It's one thing to be served the wrong food, it's another thing for the waitress to then try to put it on you, that was absolutely not okay! Then you asked me for a drink and disappear again, finally you ask me for my receipt and act as if everything was okay. The lack of common sense that she used, really ruined my whole experience; for one having Korean barbecue for the first time in New York and two at this individual location. Then when I get my receipt not being advised that there is already a service fee that is going to be attached, the first thing I told my waitress when I sat down was that this was my first time eating Korean BBQ in New York and being at this restaurant, one would think she would have as a waitress, advise me of all of the ins and outs within their establishment from food to how they serve two prices. But, no none of this was even considered for my service. That infuriated me, because the service was one non-existent and two her communication was non-existent, so therefore requiring me to give a service fee for service that was not properly rendered, quite frankly was ridiculous. I will never come to this establishment again and since  I have  been here,  I have had people ask me about it and I tell them that it is their choice if they want to go or not, but I would never recommend it to anyone. The Ambiance was nice and to know that they had karaoke in the back was nice as well, but that didn't make up for the lack of customer service. The hostess could tell I was upset and tried to apologize as I walked out, but that was not her responsibility, I could see she was making a last-ditch effort to salvage what had gone South due to the waitress, the hostess had even said she could talk to the chef for me but once again that was not her responsibility.",

Is the tip included \", and here the answer was nothing but a yes or no. \"the restaurant has a no tip included tips policy ...but those 20% goes to a collecting system for the waiters and staff\". OK soooo it is included? Here again the answer was so complicated that I had no idea what he was saying. So why don't u just say yes. U made it complicated to take advantage of the fact that I have an accent and right there is the reason why I won't come back. Too bad. Great place, great food, great environment ...

Maybe a little pricier than the typical K-town options, but for convenience that's an acceptable trade. Super tasty bbq, bi-bim-bap, japchae, seafood pancake, dumplings. Kid friendly especially in the bunch hours on the weekend. Good beer and cocktail selection, the soju bloody mary is highly recommended. Karaoke rooms are available in the back for a different experience, good for late night but also for party rental I'd guess. Kids would enjoy that too. Lounge/bar located up front would make a good stop all on it's own. If you are driving, street parking is pretty readily available on the gowanus streets surrounding the place. Very close to the R train stop at Union street and lots to do around in the neighborhood surrounding.",

We loved the chicken so much that we barely had room for our food when we were seated!  I cannot comment on the karaoke here as I have only visited to dine.",
