I got there about 10:30 in the morning. Hardly a busy time. There were maybe 4 or 5 tables occupied. I was quickly seated and promptly got the ice water I ordered...and then I waited. I was content at first because I was reading the sports section of the newspaper. When I finally looked up I noticed the guy that walked in right in front of me was already eating. I waited a few more minutes and gave up.  On my way out the hostess and 2 waitresses were standing at the register killing time. I stopped there and said \"If you need me I'll be over at Lincoln's Waffles\". They gave me a puzzled look so I explained I had waited 15 minutes and no one took my order. One of them mumbled a \"sorry\" that came across more like a shrug of the shoulders than an apology.  Well, that's my experience. Probably not typical but it never should have happened.",

The beautifully crusted and moldy interior is complimented by the smell of burnt bread, paired with the overcooked spaghetti easily make it the greatest meal available in DC. All of my classmates can give an equally good review, as you can tell by the stupid amount of reviews of middle school kids thinking they are funny. Instead of wasting your time writing a review about this place, listen to an audio book on how to be funny instead, it'll be a better use of your time. Anyways, I can't understand how such a decrepit restaurant manages to stay open without getting attention from the USDA, especially being in the middle of DC.",

They had us go up th the soda machine and fill up our glasses with whatever we wanted. There were many problems with the machine as, when you filled it up, the soda sprayed everywhere and there was no possible way to control it either. The soda machine also smelt like moldy broccoli. Throughout the building there were also many rat traps, and there were many roaches crawling around on the ground. My friend had a couple spiders in her fries, and the cake was very stale. The ceiling looked as if it was about to fall apart at any moment, the carpet was torn, and there were pieces of food everywhere. After being so disgusted, I figured the bathroom had to be just as bad. Turns out it was. There were red lights on the ceiling, and only 3 stalls that did not lock, or even close and the doors hit the toilet so you couldn't even get in. The lights did not match, some were clear, others were burnt or broken. The staff of the restaurant was just as bad too. The manager / host person would stick his fingers in his ears and touch the food. The staff did not wash their hands after going to the bathroom. And the pictures on the internet do not look at all like what the restaurant looks like today. The list goes on and on. How is this freak show still in business?!",

To take your mind off the smells admire the various holes in the ceiling and the cigarette burns on the 1960's carpets. Now that you feel better try eating the food. You will  especially enjoy the soda, garlic bread, the cheeseburgers, the spaghetti, and the chocolate cake. The soda was so watered down that you could barely taste the difference between Coca Cola and water. The garlic bread was very tough and could have doubled as a doorstop or a dog bone. The cheeseburgers were incredibly overcooked and tasted like an overcooked leather belt. The spaghetti had the same consistency as the plastic decor, and was served with a generous helping of watered down expired Ragu sauce. And finally the chocolate cake for dessert. This was my favorite by far. It was served with a tomato on top and had the consistency and taste of cardboard. If you happen to come here for a DC trip, then bring your own food with you. I had instant ramen for dinner and it tasted better than the food at Harriet\u2019s.",

The ketchup was so dark I thought someone just bled out on the table, I love some super colorful food! I also loved the extra crunchy texture of the onions in the salad that had the ring of what looked and felt like plastic. But most of all I loved the cleanliness of the place, the stains on the wall and the bugs in the air were a nice touch, I also enjoyed seeing that the toilets were brown wether they were stains or just the toilet color. Another fun addition that they had was the gorgeous and beautiful slanted wall art, and last but not least I really, really loved the fact that the \u201cchocolate cake\u201d was actually vanilla and just dyed with cockroach blood. One thing to touch on lastly is that you might want to go soon before the government shuts it down!",

I was in harriets and couldn\u2019t find a rock but I did find a piece of garlic bread that was about as hard as a rock so I took it back to the White House but the time I got back my sister was gone.

In fact, even the chaperones were disgusted.  Also, one of our friends was throwing up in the bus because of the crusty food we were served here.

First the glass that had my beverage in it had hardened chunks of who-knows-what stuck to the inside. Ok, again I can look past that. But when the food came out I immediately found a hair in my son's chicken tenders (which honestly I didn't know what they were, they looked awful). The 'slaw was in a plastic container with a lid on it, obviously not fresh, and the \"pulled pork\" was just large greasy meat chunks on a bun. The french fries were barely fried and also looked awful. Honestly the best part of this experience was the WIFI. Do not eat here.",

I got the chicken salad plate my husband and son got the burger. The burger was gigantic and tasty my chicken salad was a bit dry but the flavor was wonderful. The salad, well it was a salad, nothing spectacular. Our main complaint about this place is the waitress. When we first walked in she had her nose in her phone and ignored us a gentleman came from the back and spoke to her, that we were standing there. She jumped up to seat us, because we were the only ones in the restaurant I honestly expected her to be on top of things... she was not. She sat behind the hostess counter and kept her nose in her phone, to only get up when we annouced we needed assistance. They lost two groups of people because she was not even paying attention to them standing there, they turned around and left. The owner may want to rethink who they have for front of house and maybe the business would pick up again. I am not sure if the manager came out,  he asked us how everything was and left. He seemed to be the only concerned person.",

What should have been a half hour meal took an entire hour, I'm kicking myself now for not walking out when we had the chance because somehow four drinks, three poorly made sandwiches and a terrible salad added up to $75. Obviously that's typical pricing for a 4 person lunch in DC, but for what we got and how we were served, it was a total ripoff.  Would give it 0 stars if possible",

Granted, we received the form in catered form, so I cannot judge the typical food. The garlic bread: over toasted, not enough garlic or butter. Basically toast. Lasagna: not cooked enough, the cheese isn\u2019t melted and was found in slabs. Spaghetti: overcooked. Meatballs: need herbs. Fries: need salt. Cake: dry.  However, the food was certainly edible.  The decor needs updating. AC units should never be in the open area. Some lamps were broken. I\u2019ll leave the verdict up to the reader.",

The French fries are average, and they are only only good thing about this place.  The rest of the food i's as hard as a rock.  The plates and utensils are dirty.  The workers do all these work for you when it comes to opening the straws, as they are already opened( dirt was found in them).  I traveled to the bathrooms and found the setting of a horror movie.  The walls were crumbling and the lighting is broken.  The bathroom was small and a  open, used feminine product was found on the ground. In conclusion, please do not eat here. If you value your innocence, do not eat here.",

The restaurant has been opened since 1914 and is historically famous for its crappy food and nasty atmosphere. It serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and somehow is tragically bad at all of them. When you arrive at one of the luxurious folding tables in the sweltering dining room you get to enjoy the sight of dirty silverware and exposed wires. The all you can eat buffet is targeted towards innocent children and their unsuspecting chaperones. They serve a variety of worms with pepper ( aka spaghetti) , fries made with cardboard, mini burgers from a box (aka the \"famous sliders\"), salad from Petco, and an uncooked vegetable melody ( on the bright side raw veggies are healthy). This food is especially good because they reuse it. To top it off there is all you can drink soda that makes you high with unwrapped straws and sedimentary rock they call cake. When you need to use the bathroom ( because you will after eating here) you should look forward to trekking in to a nasty hotel to a bathroom that someone was probably murdered in. They are ignorant to the fact that they have depressingly low ratings and are surprised when you don't eat the food. To make things even better they have a fish tank with one whole fish ( at least that's what I think it was).",

He then proceeded to tell us what was being served at the buffet ( salad,Italian chicken,cod, fries, various vegetables, and garlic bread) the bread was hard as a rock my friend literally hit it on the table and it fell apart. The cod had a ton of breading on it almost so much you couldn\u2019t taste the fish itself. The spaghetti looked and tasted like chef Boyardee and the meatballs couldn\u2019t have been any colder. The chicken was over cooked and rubbery. I\u2019ll give it to them the fries were actually the only edible thing they had. I got a little of everything hoping I would find something I could eat but left starving. The cake they served as a dessert was 1/5 of a normal slice and was not any better than the rest of the food.

        "caption": "Going here with my trip to D.C, with my group of around 150, this place was picked for it allowing this large group. I read the reviews of the place and expecting the horrible mess. While it was not a rotting away restaurant, the experience was still bad.  Location: This place was right next to a restaurant named Harry's. I'm not sure in they are owned by the same company or not, but it was a bit confusing.  Walking in, I could tell that the place needed to be repaired. Sitting down, they introduced the staff.  Staff: unlike what the reviews said, the staff was extremely friendly. Everyone was willing to help you and answer your questions.  First, we got our drinks. I tried to get some Coca-Cola, only for it to dispense carbonated water! Reading the reviews, this has been broken for a long time. However, there was a second machine that worked.  Food: this was the most disappointing part. The garlic bread was just off. It was so brittle and I could barely taste the garlic. The fries were okay, but they were not the best I have. The Beef Stroganoff was just stuffed with vegetables, so much so that the beef was just not present. The chocolate cake they gave out (The Oreo desert didn't happen to us) was so thin it was a 1/5 of a regular slice.  The bathroom: well, to be honest, I can't tell you about the bathroom, because they don't have one. They ask you to go to the hotel to use the bathroom.  To end this review, I do not recommend anyone to go get food here. The place is terrible. Only go here if you want to punish a large group through lunch.  EDIT: I later learned that it was vegetable lasagna, but they mislabeled it as beef stroganoff (trying to make us eat healthier).",

The food wasn't disgusting because to be disgusting it first needs to have some type of flavor; the napkins tasted better than the actual food itself. When I went to the bathroom, it resembled a crime scene. A complete set of silverware laid on the grossly brown (what looked like they were once white) tile floor under the half detached sink. The potatoes and bread literally had mold on them. The ceiling looked like a severely dehydrated man urinated in various places. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.",

Then it took them 30 mins to explain the buffet which was set up when we got there. Next, we got drinks. The ice decides the restaurant, like is it crunchy or solid. At Harriet's the ice was missing. So the restaurant is already looking pretty bad just based on the ice. But the ice is the least of their worries. Then the silverware was the type to bend when slight pressure is applied. Next, they attempted to be organized by sending one table at a time to the buffet. The simple minded employees could not understand even those simple instructions and forgot half of the tables. When I got to the buffet, all that was left was the fried cod. Boi let me tell you I'd rather drink bleach than eat that piece of fish again. The fish was fried not once, not twice, but three times. When I tried to put my fork in it the fork bent. I don't know if it's because they are the cheapest forks ever, or if the fish was the same density as a brick. Either way I felt sick. Then my associates decided to try the other food. garlic bread = stale rock, pasta= horse manure, salad= mutated cockroach food, chicken=mama rat, fries=splinters and, cod fish=hunk of rotting goat testicles. Then came the dessert. Rat poop in the form of cake with some cow semen acting as whipped cream. Later that night every one got sick and was in the bathroom for hours. I wish there was a lower rating than one star. I hope that the health department shuts them down. Also we could not find the sanitation rating anywhere. If we did they would have a solid 24%. Now let me tell what it looks like inside, ceiling caving in, yellowed, pealing walls, broken seats/ booths. This place looks like a lower quality crack house. I needed to wash my eyes with holy water after seeing this atrocity. Please someone just expose them. Also we just looked it up, they got suspended three times once for rats,mice, and cockroaches. Suspended again for operating without water, soap, or towels. And even though the third reason is not disclosed you can only imagine the horrors that have been witnessed here. The most likely reason is probably the child molesting manager. There is also graffiti leading to the basement saying DO NOT EAT HERE!! The individual who wrote this is unknown but may have already saved life's( not all heroes wear capes ) This is only a fraction of what atrocities this \" restaurant \" holds. If you feel as though I am wrong, go and see for yourself. But be warned the is no unseeing this. ( bring something to end your misery ).",

We didn't eat it and asked the manager to take it off the bill. The original total was 33. He took off the meal we didn't eat (7$) and on his calculator I saw it said 26$ for our new total. He looked up at me thinking I didn't see his calculation and LIED straight to my face and said 27$. I asked again how much to give him a chance and then HE LIED AGAIN. I then pulled up the calculator on my phone and did the calculation to make sure I wasn't crazy. I showed my wife and she saw it too. When the manager saw that I did my own calculation he pulled the extra dollar out of the register and gave it to me. I looked him straight in the face and said GOOD LUCK!!

Trick is to get there right when a new chafing dish is put out so you skim the top layer of egg product off the top (unless you like yours marinated a little bit more).  The sausage gravy looks awesome because there is a nice layer of grease/oil on top...if you mix it in, you know you are going to be visiting one of the two multisex bathrooms there in the hotel in short order.  The sausage shavings in it really make it because it is so red, it looks radioactive and just plain unnatural.  It's probably the best thing they have.  Put it on the burnt biscuits and it's supreme.  The good thing about the coffee there is that you can see to the bottom of the cup it is so light and watery.  You need this because you have to make sure that there are no \"visitors\" (see attached picture) dinking around the bottom of the cup.  If you want a pickup game of street hockey, drop by and pick up a couple pieces of their French toast.  Careful, in the winter, they will be especially hard.  Overall, one star for each of our cockroaches scurrying across the walls for our half hour foray, because, technically, I guess we are in their house and they were nice enough and declined to jump the 10 inches onto or shoulders from their racetrack.  An extra star for the awesomeness on my plate that is the leftover drippings of the toilet water eggs that mingle with the grease exuding from the radioactive gravy.  A delicate, yet hardy combination.  Oh, and don't get me started on the twice salted bacon.  That gets an extra star for the fact that when i go for a piece with the tongs, i end up taking 20 because they are congealled together.  I can feel the combination of heartburn and diarrhea in minutes.  So overall, i guess this place gets 6 stars.  Enjoy!",
