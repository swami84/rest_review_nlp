The place is very small and easy to miss if it wasn\u2019t for the crowd of people waiting outside for their food. Definitely plan to wait 20-30 mins in times that they are really busy! There is also no seating so it is literally a grab and go kind of place.  The quality of fish is so fresh and truly delicious. The best way in my opinion to order if it\u2019s your first time is to do a 1/2 and 1/2 situation so you can try 2 things instead of one. I tried the mix maguro and the spicy poke and both were sooo good. My boyfriend tried the Hawaiian poke and he felt like it was good and very fresh. I had tried some other poke places in the area and this was one of my favorites.",

Well, if you don't really care for chains.  Fortunately, I had tried Maguro Brothers at their Chinatown location a few years back and was glad they had a location within walking distance of our hotel.  The menu had expanded since I saw it, but the nice customer service and short time to get food after ordering was the same. I'm not sure if it was this shop, eating outside in the heat vs AC, a change in quality over the years, or just my perception from my first visit at the other location years ago, but the fish was alright not amazing. Better than some of the other food in the area, but it wouldn't be top of my list to return.  If you decide to go, be prepared to take to go or eat outside. There's nowhere to eat inside, and a small bench area outside.",

There are various types of seafood bowls, but we recommend normal and spicy pockets. You can also order a combo.  The store clerk can speak Japanese and pay with a card, making it easy to use. You can eat at the hotel or you can eat at the International Market Place.  If you want to eat Ahipoke in Honolulu, we recommend the Tuna Brothers!

Regular is about $ 9. Rice is about two bowls. A mix of spicy ahi and Hawaiian ahi Spicy ahi has a spicy taste that remains in your mouth and tastes like menta mayonnaise. Hawaiian is flavored with salt, sesame oil and onions. The store manager is Japanese, and orders can be made in Japanese and English. If you get tired of American meals, we recommend it.

Very high quality for very reasonable prices. Poke is very good, but the sashimi is even better and you won't find prices this low for this quality on the mainland USA or in Japan. Takeout only; there is no indoor seating, but people who want to eat their fish when it is freshly cut can sit on the window sill outside. Expect to wait to place your order and wait more for it to be freshly prepared for you. Ask the cashier for chopsticks. Maguro Brothers also has a small booth in Chinatown (lunch only).",

It's easy to miss as it's just a window in the side of a building but they had the freshest most clean tasting fish I have had in quite some time.  The cost is extremely reasonable given the area and the portions are huge.  Service is fast and the staff was very nice.  It's take out only so make sure you have some place to eat nearby.  I highly recommend the Wasabi poke, it was delicious.",

It's in fact almost hidden, as it's on a side street with not much signage, but well lit so it's hard to miss. Order from the uber-polite guy at the window and then hang out in the parking lot while you wait for your food.  For $30 we got three dishes - tacos, poke avo & ahi, and salmon sushi bowl. Everything was delicious! One taco was raw, one was cooked, but both came with super yummy toppings! The poke over rice and salmon over rice were both fresh and tasty. We plan on going back and we're not even here for that many days! Highly recommended!",
