The guy on the phone said it was my fault they didn\u2019t notice. When I asked if It can be delivered since I obviously paid for two slices, he said the delivery  guy would not make a delivery for a single slice. On top of that he refused to give me a refund. Don\u2019t even care for the two dollars, just the fact that he wants to blame his mistake on me. So much for customer service. Like I said , was a regular and so are many of my friends and family who live in the area. After I told everyone, they\u2019re refusing to eat there again.",

The sides are just as good if not better - while in most small pie shops like this one the sides will be kind of an afterthought, here they're fantastic.  The service really makes this place stand out, especially if you're a regular. The staff remembers you, smiles, and have frequently added small bonuses, like an extra garlic knot or mozzarella stick, to my orders. I highly recommend this pizzeria both to locals who want a regular spot, and to visitors who want a taste of that legendary old fashioned small business New York pizza shop experience, which is rarer and rarer nowadays.",

Yes, the decor is still handsome, but nowhere near what it was in its heyday. More a well-appointed mausoleum than anything else. The service was all right, but the food quite awful. The smoked salmon was dry and flavorless, the lamb only adequate, and the Beef Stroganoff (which, whatever it was, wasn't Beef Stroganoff) this side of inedible. Adding insult to that inedibility were the prices. Outrageously expensive. The Russian Tea Room completely lost its way a good quarter of a century ago and has long lost any reason for being. I'm awarding two stars only for old time's sake. Very sad. And very bad.",
