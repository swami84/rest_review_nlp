I asked for \"just a tiny bit\" of marinara on my spicy footlong sub, and he TOLD me (as in not nicely, ordered me) \"no marinara\". I've been going there and doing this regularly for six years; I prefer it instead of other condiments.  We had an argument about just that, and I finally just put my foot down and told him \"no. We're doing this. Marinara on the sandwich. Now.\" Never yelling, never being mean or spiteful, just... I had to use my Boss Voice (I'm a big, tall dude, but I hate being intimidating). He then tried to tell me \"fine, but after this no marinara\", to which I replied... still in Boss Voice, \"no, any time I come in and ask, just do it. Now make the sandwich.\"  He tried a couple more times to order me \"no, after this, no marinara\", but I just kept interrupting him in Boss Voice \"I'm not asking your permission; when I come in and ask, put marinara on the sandwich\" and then just interrupting him with \"Make. The Sandwich.\" until he gave up in frustration and angrily made my sandwich while glaring at me. All this because I asked for \"a tiny bit of marinara\". I mean, we're talking maybe two tablespoons.  Just before me, he argued with a woman who asked for a couple loaves of bread; she'd already bought two footlongs, and, apparently, this was normal for her, too, but he \"instructed\" her that a footlong loaf was a footlong and cost $6 minimum.  I apologized to the other waiting customers as I left. Thankfully, I got \"you're alright\" and \"no, you're good\" in response.",
