Very disappointing  \ud83e\udd7a The owner only have his specialty like Salmon n Chicken Wings and great sides if they are ready on a good day. That menu needs to be revised big time! Its too much on the menu and isn\u2019t a full service food establishment.  Sir! Have your Specialty (Salmon n Chicken) daily and then a planned daily menu. For example Mon. Meatloaf Monday n sides that goes with that, Taco Tuesday (burrito bowls) etc. or Fish Friday (hope you  get it) and keep your Specialties daily. Not to be critical, just want this place to succeed. It will be easier too because you\u2019ll have time to chill and not be so stressed.   Hope my suggestions helps.",

My mom is in love and probably will be back tomorrow ! Lol we had the chicken, turkey, mac & cheese,mashed sweet potatoes, and creamy spinach and the sugar cookies. EVERYTHING was amazing. I just wrap my leftovers and hid them the best I could in my refrigerator so my other family members don\u2019t eat what I have left ! So glad we found this place. my mother is in love lol.. the lady at the front was so nice and helpful and everyone else said hi and was great ! What a great little gem you have thank you for the meal ! Definitely will be back ! P.s.  I never write reviews this was to good not to leave a great comment",

I called and in the process of resolving the issue the call disconnected. A hang up, perhaps? The platter I ordered was disheveled it appears as if the food was thrown on the container. The muffins weren't uninformed as they were with my first order. Overall I was displeased. The service and disheveled appearance of my food gives me the impression the chef is moody. The woman that answers the phone whom, I believe hung up on me is moody too. I do business with professionals. I'm sorry their service isn't up to my standard. I tried. Update 3/26/18 I have this establishment several more tries and my family and friends have also.  The fish I recently ordered had an unpleasant odor. The chicken my family member ordered was overly salted. We literally poured oil of the mac'n cheese.  I received a piece of extremely oily garlic bread,  it was disgusting. Everything is placed on top of aluminum foil, in a Styrofoam container.  Have these folks read how both these materials are hazardous to health? In addition to foods with too much p oil and sodium.  In addition to these things if they are not enough,  the availability of the delivery service is subpar. I feel certain this owner can hire another part time driver to handle the calls this business gets when the regular driver is out. No, he simply states delivery isn't available when his flyer, says delivery and pick up. This is unprofessional. Also I'm certain he could hire someone to clean the windows and glass door. The lack of delivery service and unclean windows and doors definitely conveys the message this owner doesn't care how he is seen by those that patronize him. I'm removing myself permanently from his patronage unless I see marked improvements.",
