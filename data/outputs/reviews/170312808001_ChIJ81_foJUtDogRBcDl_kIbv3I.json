The crab rangoons were actually the best I've had in the area - tons of filling with actual crab meat! Egg rolls were decent too. The sesame chicken, however, was the blandest I have ever tasted. It just had absolutely no flavor at all. The wonton soup was disappointing too, and was just a very different recipe than what most places serve. The wontons were very dry, the broth had very little flavor, and there were no bbq pork pieces in it. It also had carrots, pea pods, and mushrooms, which I thought was odd for wonton but easy enough to pick out. We also didn't get any fortune cookies. :( It wasn't the worst I've had but I think they desperately need to re-work their recipes if they want to last in this area.",

The food was better than ok but also not the best I have ever had. Tried the General Tso's Chicken as well as Chicken and Broccoli. The latter was definitely better. I found the general's chicken to be lacking in flavor and the chicken itself was missing that sepcial something as well. I ordered pick up, the told me 10 minutes, I was there in 10 minutes and the food was fresh, coming right off the stove as I walked in, even saw them bag it.

Now, the other half of me considered using it more for ordering delivery which I rarely take advantage of.  Furthermore, it wasn't until driving enroute from work to my apartment building one afternoon I considered picking up takeout at this restaurant. With it being new; it was half set-up with only one table near the window, and a few bar stools under a long table along the wall. I would hope that in the future they would add more furniture inside; maybe a television to give it more of a dine-in feel verses takeout which King Wok offers.  For the first time I ordered beef lo mein to try something other than my typical choices of chicken fried rice, sweet & sour chicken or sesame chicken. My food came in a very timely manner which many Chinese restaurants excel at. For that, Chinese restaurants are always second on my list to visit when I want my food served quickly.  The beef lo mein tasted nothing less than great, but tasted better the next morning after I heated it up in my microwave and ate it all.  On a last note, I do wish to see this restaurant grow, but it will have to bring a lot more than what it consists of at this moment in order to compete with King Wok Gourmet Asian, which has that dine-in appeal and already established on this side of town. It has that edge over Golden Dragon, but I do applaud whomever sent out brochures introducing it to the neighborhood.  ~Blessings~  Thomas G",

        "caption": "I always believe in giving a restaurant a second chance, sometimes even a third. This place was awful. We purposely ordered 2 different dishes that we know well in order to see what they did with me them. Kung Pao and 3 Happiness. One is supposed to be spicey, as indicated on themenu. The other is basicly some broth and garlic for the sauce. They were IDENTICAL. NO FLAVOR AT ALL! The vegetables were no longer recognizable. Total mush. We live 10 minutes away and were there 5 minutes after we placed the order. The fried rice was a soggy mess full of bread molasses. The egg rolls may have been ok at some point, but were clearly fried twice as they were mush just below the wrapper & cold mush inside. I was too tired and disgusted to be served total trash, let alone when they were peppering the neighborhood with menus to announce their grand opening. Go there at your peril. I will never go back.",
