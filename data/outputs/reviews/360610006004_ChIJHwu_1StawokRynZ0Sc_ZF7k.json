Now on to the good part, the food was so delicious. Had the Artichoke Dip, WOW! It was so delicious and the bread was so fresh!  Also had a Charcuterie board cheese and meats were fresh! Tried the special based on the recommendation from the server it was a vegan Eggplant Dish and again soooo delicious!  The drinks were specially crafted and were light so no overly sugary taste.  Overrall I will back loved this spot!  OHHHHH most important part it's Cash Only, they do have a ATM, surcharge is $2.50.",

The quality and presentation was second to none - especially under such trying circumstances. The outdoor seating has an authentic \u2018rive gauche\u2019 touch. Service was charming and efficient.

Whether the special \u201cpoulet chasseur\u201d or the regular menu like steak/moules frites or duck confit, Les Enfants is still delivering well executed food at great values in a warm setting. And the outdoor setting and live music are a great bonus.  Go and enjoy, not only the great meal and experience, but supporting an important part of the neighborhood and New York community.  Stefan and team always deliver excellent service, food and drink at great value in an relaxed atmosphere that always makes us feel like we are at home in the best neighborhood cafes and gathering places in France.  And Les enfants delices next store is great for takeaway, lunch or a quick bite.  Glad we have such restauranteurs, professionals and citizens that invest in creating community through food and place.",

The food was 10/10. My friend and I also very much enjoyed the ambience. While strictly following health guidelines and taking all the necessary safety precautions post-quarantine, they were still able to created a relaxed environment with great personnel and outdoor music. Great food, service, and prices. Would recommend and go again.",

        "caption": "Note that this restaurant only takes CASH. Food is relatively authentic and nice. However the alcohol is absolutely disgusting (don\u2019t ever order the specialty cocktail called filthy husband, I ordered just for name).  The waitress was extremely rude during payment. Cuz it\u2019s only cash, my friend and I gathered some and put it on the table. She was annoyed of how scattered the money was and said \u201ccome on guys\u201d. But seriously, aren\u2019t you the ones requesting only cash???  What I am recommending is don\u2019t indulge in their greedy practice. We all know the meaning of only cash.  Edit: I am changing it from one star to two since the food is fairly good  Edit reply: In response to restaurant\u2019s reply  It\u2019s extremely ignorant for restaurant to call out customers for giving a candid review. Just because it\u2019s frustrating for you doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s incorrect.  I would say that I shouldn\u2019t generalize all drinks offered at this place. However I really doubt anyone would enjoy your supposedly \u201cmost popular\u201d filthy husband.  People are allowed to express their own discontent against culinary offerings as well as beverages. If you can\u2019t handle criticism, maybe someone need you give you a wild awakening that your business depends on customers whose opinions shouldn\u2019t be shunned.  \u201cWe would prefer if customers would tell the bartender or server if they disliked a drink or a dish so that the problem can be fixed at the spot\u201d.  People tend to shy away from confrontations. That\u2019s why online review provides a safe space for fellow customers to fully inspect a place before entering. If someone is not appreciated by a customer, no matter if it\u2019s being \u201cfixed\u201d or not, it shall still be presented as some form of advice. Don\u2019t blame customers for taking it online, blame your own place for not making it right.  As for the CASH, I would like to put it in perspective.  1. The cash scattered on the table is a direct proof of the vast inconvenience that the restaurant imposed on customers. If you have this policy that\u2019s outright inconvenient, you have to respect and understand how customers can get flustered. A \u201ccome on guys\u201d after we tried hard to gather all cash we can seemed extremely rude.  2. Posting your CASH only policy online is simply not the way to do it. Why would every customer check your website? It\u2019s not some place customers usually go to in search for food.  3. Also please don\u2019t pin CASH policy on the convenience of customers and humanitarian practices. Anyone with a sane mind knows what CASH only means. You say you care about customers\u2019 savings. How about the transaction fees, which is not cheap, imposed on cash withdraw from the ATM (if it\u2019s not your bank). A business that does CASH only screams \u201cI don\u2019t care about you\u201d. I recommend anyone who reads this review also google why New York restaurants do cash only.  Edit: I change the ratings back to one star because I can\u2019t reply to the owner and the restaurant\u2019s attitude is not very pleasant.  Edit: in response to the restaurant\u2019s second reply  Your business has the right to practice CASH only policy. It\u2019s up to you to decide on the model (whose legitimacy is still debatable, but I won\u2019t make any insinuation).  However, customers are also allowed to make criticism against such policy.  Also, your initial argument settles on \u201chelping customers save marginal credit card fee\u201d, which I called out for due to the transaction fees from ATM withdrawal. I am not sure why your second response did not mention that.  No matter what your intention was, CASH only policy is still vastly inconvenient for customers who are entitled to the right to complain.  You are right on how customers can choose where to go based on their liking. Then why am I unfair for simply letting fellow customers know that this restaurant practices such rule?  Your rudeness is evident from saying \u201cthis review is frustrating\u201d and \u201cmaybe you can learn\u201d",

I question the wisdom of a cash-only policy for a restaurant at this price point, even with an ATM reportedly on site. Sure, the restaurant is not having to pay %s to the credit card companies, but frankly the cash-only policy could be a disincentive for customers because it means planning ahead, visiting an ATM, carrying a lot of cash (we had seven for dinner), and perhaps holding off on ordering those pricier bottles of wine so as not to come up short.",

        "caption": "Looking for a nice and interesting breakfast in the Lower East Side, around 9 or 10 o'clock, is a real challenge. We have done that before. Be it upscale Dirty French, Public Kitchen by the celebrated chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, or Izakaya Blue Ribbon, all the choices you usually get are 2 or 3 egg dishes, granolas, oatmeal (if you are lucky) and maybe an avocado toast. Brunches start usually at a later hour, around 11 AM. Les Enfants De Boh\u00e8me is a happy exclusion. The menu offers you a lot of unusual and exciting choices, such as CROQUE MONSIEUR/MADAME, TARTARE DU BLED (steak tartare), SALMON BURGER, BOHEMIAN CHEESEBURGER, and BOHEMIAN EGGS, just to name a few. All of this in addition to the wide selections of both sweet and savory cr\u00eapes (the latters are the traditional Bretonne galette de sarrasin, made with bl\u00e9 noir, gluten-free buckwheat flour and served with mixed green salad). The prices are very budget friendly, the service is great, and the interior is cozy, inviting, and informal, reminiscent of a non-touristy corner bistro de quartier somewhere in Paris, off the beaten path. That was the intention of the restaurant's owner, the Parisian St\u00e9fan Jonot, known by his previous successful restaurant ventures in the neighborhood. The restaurant is located on the corner of Henry and Jefferson streets, off the Eastern Broadway, once a hub of the Jewish communal and religious life, with numerous synagogues, small prayer houses (stiebels) of the various Eastern European hasidic groups, and the imposing building of the daily newspaper Forverts (now converted into condos). Starting from the 1980s, the area became a center of the Chinese immigrants from the southeastern China's Fujian province, and was (and still is) known as Little Fuzhou. The crime in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s was rampant (so much for those lamenting the sprawling gentrification), but right now the neighborhood is enjoying a gradual revival. Please make a mental note, Les Enfants De Boh\u00e8me is a cash only joint. There is an ATM available on the premises, but better off, just come in carrying some cash on you. Next door, on Jefferson St., there is a take-out place, Les Enfants Delice, offering some of the spacilaties the restaurants is known for. They do accept credit cards there, with a minimum of $10 charge. Les Enfants De Boh\u00e8me used to be a part of Open Table, now the reservations are obtained via Yelp.",

The kitchen was closing, but Sam, who was tending the bar delivered me that news, which i was ok with, but then raced to the kitchen and asked them what they could serve me easily without firing up an oven or stove tops.   So she asked is  Charcuterie,, OK?    yeas please, thats what i was craving,  thank you so much Sam , that was a next level customer service move you did right there,  Duck Pate as well.I was extremely grateful to be accommodated due to her efforts. What a sweetheart.    I snacked on what I got and took the rest home and they have a customer for life now.   In fairness I will not put them in the position to request bites after the kitchen closes, thanks to the kitchen staff for delivering.  Inside was very cozy, with a DJ that was spinning allot of mellow gems and there was a small group of people enjoying themselves and having a good time.   Merci Beaucoup",
