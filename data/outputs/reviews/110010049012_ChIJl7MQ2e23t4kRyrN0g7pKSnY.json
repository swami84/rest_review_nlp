It was so bad I went Chaplin's next door to get myself a proper drink. The music was great with 3 DJs: Phillip the Haitian, Cleveland Browne, and Paul Howard. I will have to drop my rating.

I knew the previous owners and I always had a great experience when I ate at Queen of Sheba. But, I placed an order by phone for a pick up. I ordered a beef tibs and chicken tibs and I also ordered my sides as gomen and shiro and I was assured that I would not be charged extra for a side of shiro. When I checked my order in person I saw no shiro. I asked for the owner and he said sorry but shiro is usually used as a main dish and takes a while to make shiro. I was puzzled because he agreed to give me shiro as a side. He then insisted that he would tell the cook make it for me but I didn't want to wait any longer. I was looking forward to support this restaurant even with new ownership but I'm not happy about my experience and doubt that I'll go back. I wouldn't recommend it at all.",

I went to the hospital and the doctor took some stool and blood samples. He detected a Lomotil a formula that causes severe constipation.

This was going to be the perfect place for me to celebrate my 59th birthday. Our first date was at an Ethiopian restaurant in Seattle. I called the restaurant about an hour before we went there to ask if we needed a reservation. They said yes, so I told them 2 people at 7:30. I thought it a bit strange that they didn't ask my name.  We arrived a  bit after 7:30. The restaurant has seating for about 30 people, not counting the bar. The center of the restaurant was occupied by a group of 20 who were not yet eating. Our waitress motioned for us to take a seat. After about 10 minutes of being ignored, I went up to the bar where I was ignored for a few more minutes. I finally cornered our waitress and asked if perhaps we could get some soup while we were waiting. She apologized, and showed up at our table a couple of minutes later. We ordered a veggie platter and a lamb dish, and waited. And waited. ...  At some point we asked for a cup of tea which miraculously did arrive. After waiting about 45 minutes to eat, I went to the bar again to let the waitress know that we had been waiting almost an hour, were hungry, and had an early flight to catch the next morning. She again apologized, and disappeared into the back. Finally my wife said we should just leave. I was thinking the delicious smelling food might arrive any minute, so once again I went back to the bar. It was deserted. So after sitting there for more than an hour, we left and went next door to a swanky bar where we were served after a few minutes.",

        "caption": "I have been eating Ethiopian food as one of my favorite cuisines almost my entire life and this is by far the best tasting, and most authentic Ethiopian I have ever tried. My girlfriend was raised in Ethiopia and she agrees as well. There is such a variety of options to choose from ranging from Fish to Meat dishes, to Vegetarian options, to even Breakfast and Smoothies. They also offer some American and Italian dishes in case you go with a larger group and some folks want to stick with what they know... There's also a nice happy hour and performers on the weekends so it makes a nice date night at later hours (open till 2am Sun-Thurs, & 3am Fri-Sat). Hands down our favorite restaurant in the DMV when we need some soul satisfying food and a nice cozy atmosphere with friendly people. Good for family outings during lunch & dinner.",
