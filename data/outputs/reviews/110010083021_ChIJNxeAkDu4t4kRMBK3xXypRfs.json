Sauces are rich, cuts are thick, and the smoker keeps the meats moist with plenty of flavor. My friends and I decided to order the pulled pork, brisket, pork ribs and the slow smoked wing with a side of fries, coleslaw and onion rings. The brisket had to be my favorite. It was so delicious and I found myself taking a break after each bite to enjoy it. The slides are no joke. The onion rings were fried perfectly and they made the coleslaw just the way I like it. Cold in temp, crispy cabbage and plenty of mayo. Highly recommend this location if you want some quality bbq. They take Covid seriously with ordering through the window and outside patio seating. Food made take some time to come out, but well worth the wait.",

They have this spicy bbq sauce they got in from Texas that is just fantastic. I went with a buddy and we both had a platter of food that could've easily fed ten people haha ribs, pulled pork, fried fish, baked beans, mac and cheese, collard greens, cornbread, slaw, french fries, and onion rings. Literally everything was mouth watering delicious. Ribs fell off the bone, there pulled pork was tender and juicy, the fish was flavorful and had a nice crispy fried coating. The owner that we meet, Summer, is definitely one of those businesswoman who could be doing anything and would be killer successful at it bc she clearly has a vision for how she runs her business, and we're glad this place has her behind the helm. Their fried fish is second only to Oohhs and Aahhs, in my opinion, and their ribs rival DCity Smokehouse. I'll be coming back for sure, and it's great that they've made all the precautions for social distancing to safely enjoy the foodie experience. five stars!",

I immediately fell for the atmosphere and THEN they served me up their brisket sandwich. I've visited twice more since and food has been consistently amazing. You're going to get tender and juicy brisket (which I was just told is patiently smoked for 13 hours). That will not be outdone by the pulled pork. No sauce needed. It's THAT delicious, but if you need to mix your flavors, I recommend the Miss Honey sauce. This visit I went with a special, the bulgogi with a side of kimchi. If my taste buds could jump off my tongue and dance, they would be tap dancing on the beautiful wood benches and tables. So stop reading and get over to Kenny's to see for yourself. Sit outside on the patio. Sip on something from their tab. Try something, ANYTHING off their menu. You will not be disappointed. P.S. Take some home to your gf. She'll love ya for it!",

But what I love about Kenny's is their desire to be a true part of the community. This weekend we held a block party and on a whim reached out to Kenny's to see if they would be interested in donating some food. Not only did they donate, they went above and beyond by providing us with an incredible spread. The owner even made some homemade items not on their menu. They dropped it off and even came back to join in the festivities. As our neighborhood continues to change and as new business come in, it is heartening to know that there are still folks who have interest in on just serving the community but being active participants in it. Bravo, Kenny's. You have earned some customers for life!",

The hunk of love that is the corn bread....think 'LIFE' The Movie.  Thick, hunk of just sweet enough goodness.  Yams were missing a little brown sugar, vanilla, butter and cinnamon but they were good none the less.  I had a taste for BBQ chicken but a half chicken is just too much portion for one so I opted or the fried flounder.  Battered, crispy, hot out of the fryer and seasoned well.  We didn't quite finish the reds beans and rice - kinda firm for everyone's liking.  A little out of place for a BBQ joint, too.  4 stars!",

First, the inside is small and dark, and the process for ordering is unclear. There's usually only two people working, so it doesn't make sense that the person taking the orders at the register is also responsible for bringing out all the trays of food outside. But because there isn't a counter to set the trays and call orsers, there aren't any other options.  Second, the BBQ sauces are incredibly disappointing. They have 5 or 6, and none of them enhance the meat's flavor. Also, both times I have visited I have to walk around to several tables in order to get a bottle of each sauce. The owners should really put a set of all the sauces at each table.  Third, the meat itself is bland. The ribs are tough and the pork sandwich made me feel sick.  The sides are just okay. The sweet potatoes are the best thing thing going for them.  Kenny's is in a good location, so it's really disappointing how unenjoyable it has been, especially after the new ownership.",

I went to another famous place off of Eastern Avenue on the Maryland side and their sides were disgusting.  Their ribs are very good but their sides are not and I am so thankful to a place like Kenny's that not only makes delicious ribs but delicious side toppings.  Their macaroni and cheese is to die for. Everybody's macaroni and cheese is not good, theirs is.  They do need to work on their candied yams also because there is not enough sugar or butter or molasses in them and that is not good.  We can work with their candied yams, and we can doctor them up and make them better by putting a bunch of butter and sugar on them, but they should try a little bit harder on them and the collard greens.  I like their sweet Mississippi sauce also. It is delicious.  I've been three times so far this month.",

I went to another famous rib place off of Eastern avenue on the Maryland of Sherrif Rd. Their ribs were good, but their sides were so nasty, tasteless, and disgusting that they made me appreciate Kenny's even more.  I had some Kenny's sides from 5 days before leftover and I ate it with those ribs and it was just as delicious as if I had just bought Kenny sides that day.  I hate to say it but it was actually worth it for me to pay twice as much for Kenny sides then it is to save the money and have some nasty sides like that.  I have been there twice so far and I can't wait to come back again. We get the ribs plate every time and they are worth it to me.  There are no strong complaints here other than the collard greens are a little spicy but they calm down after a while. They need to get rid of them the stalks on the end.  They do not and they should not be cooking with them. They should have been cleaned off of the leaves.

What had been a genuine DC institution is now a cookie-cutter faux rustic \"BBQ\" joint down to the ubiquitous tin serving trays. The pork bbq sandwich was cold and flavorless as were the collard greens. The sauces were replaced with bland, institutional bottles. Good reasonably priced non-boutique barbecue has become harder and harder to find in this area, and while I'll give it another try, I'll recommend heading out to Southern Maryland or making the drive out to Warrenton, VA's BBQ Country for the real deal. Here's hoping Kenny's remembers what made it notable.  2/22/19. Went back for another try last week. Just as tired as before. That was it for me.",

I didn't care for the pork ribs -- too much bone, too much fat, very little seasoning. The brisket, however, was sublime and they don't skimp on the meat for the sandwiches. Also all the sauces are fantastic and worth trying. My favorites are Kenny's hot sauce and the tangy Carolina BBQ. Service could stand to be improved, the hostess is sometimes AWOL until the cook shouts her in.",

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and sides. Everything was delicious!! We tried all the sauces. Each one was very tasty! It may have been a little more expensive than I would have liked, but the portion sizes were good. Can't wait to visit again!!",

        "caption": "If you're torn on the issue of gentrification, you're torn on Kenny's BBQ. It's been a local, hole-in-wall BBQ joint for years. It did one thing right- make good BBQ. The rest (atmosphere, cleanliness, etc) didn't matter. It was a classic. President Obama visited. It was a hidden gem.  Fast forward to 2017. There's new ownership. The neighborhood is changing. Hipsters are moving in and want the illusion of eating at a dive, but they want it their way. It must be a dive so they feel cool but it must be clean, 5 stars on Yelp, and have a cute sign to Instagram.  With all that in mind, Kenny's BBQ has been \"hipsterized.\" I don't wear skinny jeans, but perhaps my \"yuppieness\" still puts me in the same category. I'm a fan! Here's why it will become the hipster spot of Capitol Hill:  1) The sign- The old red, cheesy sign has been replaced with a black one that says \"Kenny's\" in a cool, simple type font painted on the building. It looks good on Instagram.  2) The look and feel- Yes, it has a new brand. There are several outdoor high top tables. The inside is a clean, simple BBQ joint similar to what you'd expect in Austin, Texas. It's dark, but not overwhelming. There's window seating. There's perfect lighting in the corners. There's an open kitchen area. There's a typewriter (Yep, hipsters love a good typewriter) and a blown up photo of President Obama dining there. The menu is handwritten on parchment paper. You just feel cool being there.  3) The food- Hipsterized Kenny's is a classic example of the power of branding. It's literally the same food as before but with a new look and presentation; it tastes better. The brisket is perfect. The pulled pork tender in the right ways. The sides are on fleek (Especially the mac and cheese and MAYO based coleslaw).  4) The beer- What kind of beer do hipsters think they like? CRAFT beer! On tap or in a bottle, they serve local and regional craft beer.  5) The sauce- In the middle of the restaurant, there exists a wooden island with bottle after bottle of BBQ sauce and hot sauce. Of course they come in squeeze bottles so it doesn't look like they're trying too hard to be cool (so hipster). If you want Carolina BBQ (my recommendation), they have it. If you need mild, it's there along with 3-4 other BBQ options. Although different, they all pop with flavor.  Hipsters, grab your Warby Parkers and little dogs and smoother your half shaven face with some of the best BBQ in the District (and look cool doing it).",
