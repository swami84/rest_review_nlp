I arrived to valet at 2:06 and was told we had to walk around the entire building which approximately took five minutes and put us at 2:11. Upon entering this establishment with the reservation I was told by the hostess Sophia there was a 10 minute grace period which was contradictory to what I was told previously. The manager Matt was little to no help. Very poor customer service and complete waste of time!! It\u2019s unfortunate that my husband whom plays for the Ravens would recommend such a poor establishment.",

There were \"Reserved for social distancing\" signs at about every other table. By 9 pm, those signs were gone and every single table was filled with people. Not to mention a very loud table behind us which the wait staff stood with talking, masks down, and taking shots. For what we paid to eat there,  I am hoping I also did not pay to get exposed to COVID simply because this restaurant doesn't care about its guests.",

The sushi/sashimi selection is impressive (16 seafood types), also including an uncommon item: toro.  In fact, they have a Blue Fin Tuna \"flight\" of six pieces taken from three different areas of the belly, ranging from soft to butter.

The cocktails and sake selection was well curated and crafted well. FOOD:  We had the Wagyu fried rice, Emperors feast and Royal sushi selection and all the desserts. The sushi transported us back to the Tsukiji Tokyo market in freshness but the rice was not as well balanced. The crab roll was too overwhelmed with mayonnaise. The uni was VERY disappointing as it looked bright orange, dessicated and shriveled. She exuberantly quipped it was from Santa Barbara which excited us even more but in the end ...you could get better from your local Sushi place. Skip the small scoop of wagyu fried rice which was speckled on a greasy mound with a puddle of Siracha ..which totally overwhelmed the delicate beef taste...save the 21 bucks and order more sake! All the desserts were well balanced/unique and tasty....not to be missed.  Overall ...a pleasant dinning experience..in a more sanitized/mainstream Japanese meal ( nothing unique/authentic)  ,al fresco dinning  next to the water away from noisy traffic.",

The Flaming King Crab Roll was definitely my favorite - presentation and taste are a 10+! I started with the Rock Shrimp Tempura, which comes over a bed of baby lettuce and it was really tasty! The baby lettuce with the shrimp paired well!  My husband and I also had our 4 year-old daughter with us; however, be aware that the restaurant does not have a menu specifically for kids. With that, we ordered her a bowl of Vegetable Fried Rice but she did not like it (I did though - the red sauce around the plate was so good paired with the rice!). Our daughter let Mason know she did not like the vegetable fried rice and he brought her out a bowl of white rice (she didn't eat that either).  The vibe at Azumi is cute, grown, and sexy - lots and lots of candles and dim lights. There is seating outdoors, as well as inside - we sat inside. There are also plenty of heaters throughout the patio outside, too, so no need to worry about being cold in the fall and winter months. Next time my husband and I visit, we will definitely be kid-free and said we'd like to sit outside to enjoy to water views. 'Til next time Azumi!",

As you can see in the pictures this is all that came on the plate. Other restaurants I've visited has give more for the price. My food was placed on the table at 9:30p and I was told by the waiter at 9:45p she was going to bring me my check because we had to move outside at 10p.

There were 5 different types of seaweed which I was excited about. But to my disappointment only 1 of the 5 was any good. Just give us classic seaweed salad. I also paid $24 for a rainbow roll that was below average and fell apart. The rice was soggy and the fish had a funky smell and was warm. However, I will say the service was pretty good and the food came out fast. Overall, In my opinion, you're better off going somewhere else. Save your dollars and just avoid the trendy hype.",

When I asked the manager why he didn\u2019t contact me, he copped an attitude and said that he can\u2019t track down every person that forgets their card.

Frankly, I am a regular at another great sushi restaurant in Columbia and I had thought that Azumi was just an overpriced and overrated sushi restaurant in the city.  The place I go to in Columbia treats me well and they get in some really nice stuff for the weekend.  With that said, I knew that I was in for a different experience at Azumi from the moment I laid eyes on the fresh fish at the sushi bar.  I was by myself which Is actually a great way to experience a great sushi bar because its easier to talk to the sushi chefs about what you like (seriously, try it).  I asked for a \u201ctour\u201d of the fish at the sushi bar and quickly developed a plan of attack.  I decided the Tuna tasting was a good base to build the rest of my meal upon.  I also ordered a live uni which I had only had once before and a couple of other orders of nigiri and a nice hand roll.  After this, I told the sushi chefs Mark and Billy what I liked and asked them to make a couple of things for me to finish my meal.  Everything I had was excellent.  The texture and temperature of everything I ate was about as perfect as it gets.  The service was great.  I can\u2019t really even think of a criticism at the moment.  I don\u2019t usually order many rolls when I get sushi, so I cannot comment much about them, but the rolls I saw going out to other customers looked really nice.  I plan to come back here to try the Omakase as soon as I can.  This is the best sushi restaurant in the Baltimore area, particularly if you consider yourself something of an advanced sushi eater.",

I decided on the Azumi tasting platter and let the chef make his selections for the evening and I was unbelievably impressed with every course. The miyazaki wagyu was my favorite selection, as every succulent morsel simply dissolved in your mouth. I'm confident you could even eat it without teeth! For dessert, I reccomend the chocolate lava-cake, it takes up to 20 min or so to prepare, but you will be overwhelmed with bliss when the first spoonful reaches your lips. This was our first time here and we WILL return for another sample of their extensive, fresh, and unique menu. As an added bonus, go on a Friday or Saturday evening if you're a car enthusiast; it was an endless line-up of super cars rolling past our window booth (the Ferrari 488 was my favorite).",

Service was stellar, especially considering how packed it was, and they comped our shishito order. It's not enough to entice me back, however.  PS This place has an excellent view of 4th of July fireworks.",

Nice outdoor bar and eating area that we'll have to try next time when the weather is warmer.",

The service was above average, mostly attentive. Our server was very honest about choices we inquired about, which we were most appreciative of. The only reason for the two stars was the seafood pancake appetizer and the waguy (Australian) skewer. Both were delish. The fish was way overpriced for the quality. The tuna belly was fine, never find it to be worth the cost personally but the salmon and eel were actually tough to chew. Certainly strange experience and supremely disappointing. To top it off there was excessively loud club music, and bad club music taboot blasting in our ear. It\u2019s was a pretty big miss.",

I guess the chef had not let it thaw out enough. Soup and salad were good but the roll my girlfriend ordered was covered with diced onions, so much that you couldn't taste any other aspect of the roll. The music was pretty loud and I guess we had problems communicating with our waitress since it took 2 separate ocassion's to flag her down and ask where are drinks were. Decor was nice and people were friendly. They sat us promptly at 915 and even gave us a choice of table. Might be willing to try something off the kitchen menu next time but definitely will not be ordering sushi/sashimi again. For the price of the dining experience I was hoping to compare it to my town home of NYC but clearly Baltimore is not even close to that level.",

The service was amazing; our server, Eric, was very knowledgeable about the sakes' particular flavor, especially when we were trying to choose between several descriptions that were similar, and how they would pair with the food that we chose. We do have dietary restrictions and he was very accommodating and honest about which items were easily made without dairy. His SA, Carolina, was super friendly and made us feel very invited (even though our dented honda wasn't good enough to be valeted with the Diamond white Benz's). She was perfectly attentive and quite familiar with the menu as well. This restaurant has a low-key, metropolitan, meet-me-after-dinner-with-the-girls-it'll-just-be-us atmosphere, lighting that really escalates the experience, and extremely welcoming staff; everyone who touched our table was a great personality! The only thing that was a disappointment was the booth which was too large to make the time we spent there very romantic. I saw the tables that were meant for two but they were much too crowded and did not have enough space to accommodate all the dishware needed for multiple courses or sushi. I would definitely go again!",

I finally dragged my boyfriend there and though parts of the meal were great, I wouldn't recommend it anymore.  Most of the food was amazing--the appetizers and entree we shared were fantastic. Bravo to the kitchen. The atmosphere and drinks were lovely as well. But the sushi was beyond bad.  One of the four rolls we got was great. The two specialty rolls were mediocre at best; not horrible, but not enjoyable and less flavorful than what we would typically get at a neighborhood sushi joint (much less an expensive one like this). One was the same roll I'd ordered a few months before; something had definitely changed because I thought it was fantastic that time. To call tonight's version lackluster in flavor would be a kindness.  The last roll, though: Ugh. It was a simple tuna roll. But the tuna was not good. It had a very off flavor--fishy in a BAD way-- and the texture was just wrong (suuuper mushy, like it was disintegrating).  The server took it off our bill which was nice, but nobody apologized or confirmed that we had been served spoiled sushi. When it's just a matter of personal preference, I would never get upset, but I've eaten enough raw seafood in my life to know something was seriously wrong. Unfortunately, I won't be back.",

I am DEFINITELY coming back!! I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the full experience. We got a chance to ask questions to Mark and one of the other chefs, James, who was also super knowledgeable!  We got a bunch of different kinds of nigiri. I loved all of them. The ones that stick out are the salmon belly (lightly torched), saba (pickled in house), red snapper, and yellow tail. But honestly they were all soo good!  Also chef Andy gave us some really delicious eggplant and there was this amazing seared live scallop dish that was soo fresh and tasty. Eric was our server, and he was super attentive and helpful, too! I can't wait to come back :)",

I'd recommend ordering several dishes to share among 2 or 3 people so you can try lots of the menu. The wagyu dish is really amazing. The nigiri was kind of skimpy on the fish and the rice consistently separated, but overall it was tasty. Most interesting was the drink I ordered that came with a literal crab in it! This place is not cheap and not the most authentic Japanese, but I'd probably come back again.",

Well I didn't choose this place, my good good girlfriend chose this place for me to have my birthday happy hour, and I'm so thankful that she did! This place has everything, when I say everything... I mean everything! The ambience was fantastic! The inside of the establishment is beautiful as well as beautifully decorated w a Japanese theme to it; mixed with a little of American. There is plenty of outdoor seating, I mean PLENTY... almost as much seating as indoor! Beautiful views of the Baltimore Inner Harbor from every seat outdoor and indoor! The bar is beautiful, well-lit, well-stocked, and has the best bartenders ever! Fantastic drink recommendations, as well as you get a show each time they make a drink! I am so happy with the decision made to visit this establishment that I can't stop saying it! We ordered plenty of drinks... food items... Everything our little heart desired & everything ordered was delivered to our seats quickly! I even tried new menu items I've never tasted before, and they came out wonderful! I definitely look forward to returning back here in the near future to try some other items as well as get some other specialty cocktails from the wonderful bartenders!  The only issue I have with this place, valet parking is $12! I thought that was pretty expensive for the area that the restaurant was in, but worth it if you're in a rush... And I was in a rush! I must admit, even the valet guys were very very nice! They had a great sense of humor and they handled my car with care, so maybe it wasn't so bad, and maybe I will valet again just so I can interact with them. This restaurant location is not far from the other shops here at Harbor East, therefore you can park elsewhere and just walk over. There's also a garage connected to the same building as well as across the street that shares with the hotel if you want other parking options.",

Sunday I was severely sick with food poisoning and felt extremely bad. In the morning today I found out that 4 other people from the birthday party had the same symptoms, and one girl nearly got to the hospital after fainting! I'm extremely upset! I found out that people were poisoned there before multiple times! How is this possible in 5* place??? This is absolutely outrageous! I'm going to file a complaint to Baltimore City board of health. If it won't shut them down then at least more inspections will be performed and other customers will not suffer like we did! I'm still recovering. The worst I have ever felt in my life! I will not let it slide!",

I didn't expect free parking but damn, the closest parking garages are mostly reserved or valet.     It really puts a damper on a date when you spend 30+ minutes getting parking. When we got to the restaurant we were the second table seated...and somehow forgotten about.  It took 30 minutes to get a drink order, another 20 after that for our food order, and just under an additional hour to get sashimi. SASHIMI. We tempted desert and the wait was just as long as everything else. We saw people around us seated, served, and out the door who had arrived long after us.  We were there for three hours.  While the food was stellar, it put my husband and I off on our weekly date night. We won't be returning.  If you have a ton of time and are staying locally, the food is top notch...but the service...failed.",

One thing that did stand out were the signature mixed drinks which were excellently crafted and presented.

The entire meal was amazing, and well worth it.  The drinks were very well made - we went for almost one of every cocktail throughout the night and every single one was awesome.  If you're not going for the tasting menu, I definitely recommend at least going for the king crab legs hot appetizer - the spicy soy butter on top of very meaty claws/legs was amazing.  We'll be back for sure.",

I ordered the spicy tuna roll ($10) and got poop on a plate. It was ok tasting but their spicy sauce was mostly mayo and the tuna inside was a big lump that was weirdly firm. When I asked if they could ask crunch flake to the roll, they responded with no. Yet my husbands roll came with it on it? No special orders I guess? Idk. And when the server asked how was everything, and I stated my distaste, he just \"I'm sorry\" and left. ???? Ok weirdo! Why ask if you aren't going to fix it. Don't think I'll be back.",

That fear is irrelevant now with Azumi's arrival in the city. The food, cocktails, and service have been 5 stars. Can't wait to see how this place continues to grow and change the Baltimore dining scene!",
