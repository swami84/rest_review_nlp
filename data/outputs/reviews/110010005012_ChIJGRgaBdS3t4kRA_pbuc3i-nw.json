They showed no courtesy at all throughout, refused to pay much attention to our simple request for separate checks. Instead, the guys just threw a plain-paper receipt at us which would be no use for reimbursement purposes for any of us. They seemed pretty unhappy that we were there which is slightly ungrateful!",

They had the lunch buffet so I thought we'd give that a try. Flavors were very bland, and lacked South Asian textures. Take it from someone who grew up eating it, and knows that good SA food tastes like. Service was 1/5.  The waiter barely checked on us, and brought naan halfway though the meal. Went back for seconds, and buffet was partially empty. Getting the check was a task too. I would not recommend this place. Keep it moving.",

The same happened with getting my check; I wasn't ready to take it right when the waiter came by, so I had to wait a considerable amount of time for him to come back. Meanwhile an angry man who appeared to have a personal or work relationship with a restaurant employee went storming out of the main entrance, and as I was sitting right by the front window facing the sidewalk, I could hear all the screaming and cursing... wasn't exactly the peaceful dinner I had hoped for, but the food itself was good.",

That's why I didn't give this restaurant one star.  But, my food came with a fly on it and it definitely was not cooked freshly.  The meat was served within minutes, and upon asking if it's fresh, I was told, \"Try it.  It was cooked today.\"  (Naturally I'm thinking WHEN today.)  The meat was warm (not hot) and dry as if it was sitting around for a long while and rewarmed.

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) We visited this restaurant on 11.08.2016 at 21 clock local time. For this time the restaurant was very little visited. There were two more guests there. That alone should have us startled. When we entered it, a friendly Indian waiter came to watch us at our table. Already there we noticed the strong smell. It smelled like the cat station of the local cat club. Nothing against cats, but the smell definitely does not belong in a restaurant !!! Unfortunately we decided to stay. Since the cards were brought to us quickly and my family members thought that it was too late to leave. The card was fine. There was a large selection of Indian food. When the waiter came to take our order there were the first problems with the communication. Actually, one would think that in America everyone who speaks English can speak English. This was unfortunately not the case with the waiter. It was difficult to understand him, not at all. In addition, he made a very unsympathetic impression that should solidify in the course of our visit. The food came after some time and it was ok, not very good but edible. When the waiter after some time looked after us and asked us in his unsympathetic way if we wanted something to drink, we made it clear that we wanted nothing more. However, despite telling us clearly that we did not want anything, he brought us two more Diet Cokes. At first we were so surprised that we did not say anything. We thought maybe she would kindly go to the house. Unfortunately, this was not so and our bill had become more expensive at five Doller. When paying the bill, the waiter from a short distance looked at us with a reproachful look at how we looked at the bill and put the money in the bowl. He then wordlessly took the bill and we left. I would not visit this restaurant again.  (Original) Wir besuchten dieses Lokal am 11.08.2016 gegen 21 Uhr Ortszeit. F\u00fcr diese Uhrzeit war das Lokal sehr gering Besucht. Es wwaren noch zwei weitere G\u00e4ste dort. Allein das h\u00e4tte uns schon stutzig machen sollen.  Als wir es betraten kam uns ein freundlicher Indischer Kellner der uns zu  Uhr unserem Tisch f\u00fchrte. Schon da bemerkten wir den strengen Geruch. Es roch wie auf der Katzenstation des \u00f6rtlichen Katzenvereins. Nichts gegen Katzen, aber der Geruch geh\u00f6rt definitiv nicht in ein Restaurant!!! Leider entschieden wir uns zu bleiben. Da uns auch schnell die Karten gebracht worden sind und meine Familienmitglieder meinten, dass es zu sp\u00e4t sei um zu gehen.  Die Karte war ganz in Ordnung. Es gab eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Indischen Speisen. Als dann der Kellner kam um unsere Bestellung aufzunehmen gab es die ersten Probleme bei der Verst\u00e4ndigung. Eigentlich m\u00fcsste man meinen, dass in America jeder der da Lebt Englisch sprechen kann. Dies war bei dem Kellner leider nicht der Fall. Man verstand ihn nur schwer bis \u00fcberhaupt nicht.  Noch dazu machte er einen sehr unsympathischen eindruck der sich noch im Verlaufe unseres Besuches verfestigen sollte. Das Essen  kam dann nach einiger Zeit und es schmeckte ganz in Ordnung, Nicht sonderlich gut aber essbar. Als der Kellner nach einiger Zeit nach uns sah und uns in seiner unsympathischen Art fragte ob wir noch was Trinken wollten, gaben wir deutlich zu verstehen, dass wir nichts mehr wollten. Jedoch brachte er uns trotz klarer Aussage, dass wir nichts mehr wollten, zwei weitere Diet Cokes. Wir waren im ersten Moment so \u00fcberrascht, dass wir nichts sagten. Wir dachten, vielleicht w\u00fcrde sie netterweise aufs Haus gehen. Leider war dies nicht so und unsere Rechnung war um F\u00fcnf Doller teurer geworden. Beim Bezahlen der Rechnung guckte uns der Kellner aus einer kleinen Entfernung mit einem Vorwurfsvollem Blick dabei zu wie wir die Rechnung betrachteten und das Geld in die schale legten. Er nahm dann Wortlos die Rechnung mit und wir gingen. Ich w\u00fcrde dieses Restaurant nicht noch einmal aufsuchen.",

This place is AMAZING. We came during the summertime and sat on the patio. I ordered the same thing I always do when our waiter (who knows what good food is all about) suggested a different combination. Curious, I agreed and we got some samosas and garlic naan to match it.  Every dish was 5 stars. From the samosas to the lentils, aloo gobi and rice. They had flavor, texture, and spice that was spot on. The waitress made sure our glasses were never empty and our other waiter was the coolest guy you will ever meet. We had ras malai at the end (PSA: if you haven't tried it yet, you're seriously missing out. It is amazing.  In short, this place makes you feel happy, welcome, and leaves you with a full stomach for great prices. Overall five stars. Truly a DC gem.",
