The bone pieces made it impossible to eat the meal. And there was not even a plastic ot coated paper bowl. Tiny plastic spoon. When I asked why what I got was different from the meal pictured, I was told the photo was just for show.  Pure misrepresentation and bad customer service. Stay away..",

You have the chicken, half or whole that comes with rice and spicy dipping sauce. The papaya salad packed a punch in flavors and spice at medium level. The grilled pork shoulder and laab mu (pork) and seems pretty popular is the Zaab wings. We shared the chicken, laab mu and papaya salad.  I really liked the chicken. Is was juicy and flavorful. The accompanying dipping sauce added a nice spiciness to it. The papaya salad was full of flavor and plenty of umami with bits of tiny dried shrimp and fish sauce. The cabbage and cucumber added a nice level of crunch. The laab mu went great with rice. This one is a bit more watery (sauce) than others I've tried (which was dryer and slightly crispy - which I think I liked better).  I will definitely be ordering more from them. I like that it seems like more healthy option if you keep from the fried wings. Spice level is moderate on the medium level. It isn't overly spicy but enough to know it is there. I tend to like it slightly hotter but you can adjust as you like when ordering.",

        "caption": "The zaab wings are fire! If you like serious heat in your food, this is the place and the dish for you. The wings have a distinct chili-lime flavoring. It's a unique flavor combination and both flavors are prominently on display. I'm wasn't a fan of their sticky rice, but their jasmine rice is just plain ol' jasmine rice. Pro tip: Take the coating from the zaab wings and sprinkle it onto the sticky rice, or just dump the rice into the box with the wings so that it can soak up the coating. Trust me, it'll be good.  When CI first opened they'd serve the wing pieces intact. Now, they separate the drums and flats, which is a decision that I wasn't happy about, but the wings still have the same great taste. Honestly, I'm wondering if they've turned up the heat and made them even hotter.",

        "caption": "Visited Chicks Isan on Wednesday and easy to see that they just opened by how disorganized they were and that everything was served in these containers. Apparently they have a seafood restaurant in the city as well.  The first dish is called Larb Moo which is minced pork tossed with Thai herbs. According to the menu online and at the location for $9 it\u2019s suppose to come with toasted sticky rice but the person swore that rice is an extra $3 bucks so I got jasmine instead. I did not know nor did the counter person mention anything about heat and boy was my mouth on fire \ud83d\udd25. If we put my destroyed \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f taste buds aside the food actually had pretty good flavors. I ended up eating only 1/4 of the dish and took the rest home to let my wife taste the fire.  The second picture is of a fried chicken wing I stole from a coworker they call \u201cZaab Wings\u201d. Here you get a slight bit of heat on the back end with strong lime flavors. I wish I bought this instead as i was able to actually eat this and enjoy with what was left of my taste buds.  Overall the verdict is that it will be a good addition once the bumps are worked out and they get a control on there heat levels.",
