A delicious meal on a budget.  The fries were perfectly crisp and the meat was tender, and wrapped in the chewy toasted bread (They have falafel for non-meat eaters). My server was extremely kind and hospitable. Guests even were treated with a free dessert of Greek yogurt drizzled with honey and a fruit compote.  I highly recommend this place if you\u2019re missing Mediterranean food.",
