My friend and I stumbled upon Wok and Roll on H Street which was empty, though thankfully, we were able to eat-in.  Since no one was there, we did not wait long to be seated. Our host/server was very professional, attentive, and catered to our every need. They have great hospitality.  We ordered the appetizer plentiful for 2 people which had wontons, spring rolls, ribs, and beef on a stick, glazed with sauce. That was delicious! I then ordered the udon soup with seafood, and was satisfied with that as well. I drank the zombie cocktail which has a strong pineapple taste. My date ordered the curry chicken meal that comes with fried rice. There was a LOT of food, so he ended up taking half of it to-go. That says a lot, because he never takes restaurant food home.  Originally, we were going to another eatery that I like. Fortunately, they were only delivering food because otherwise, I wouldn't have known about Wok and Roll.  Thank you all for great food and great service.",

I did order additional egg roll after,  arriving to pick up my order.  it was delicious.

I hope that was the only piece that was in the food.  Even though this happened I will give the taste and quality of their food a good rating.  \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude01",

I rented the room in honor of my birthday, and the wait staff was so rude to me. No one came to our room to help us order food and drinks, and no one working there apologized for not attending to my friends and I. Also, my friend asked to speak to their manager, and he was no where to be found. They did take down her number, and I really hope he contacts her, because I've been to this restaurant before, and I didn't have a terrible experience the first time, so I'm really upset and disappointed with their lack in attentiveness to satisfy their customer's needs when they're trying to have a great celebration.",

The waiting /bar area is open /free karaoke and I wish it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s a super chaotic atmosphere trying to order drinks and pay with people screaming into the mic.

For theother menu items I ordered the salt and pepper fish and my colleague ordered the Singapore noodles. The Singapore noodles were not spicy at all even though we requested that it be spicy. I had really wanted to order the Hunan whole fish but was told by the waiter that it would take 45 minutes to prepare.",

It was a good idea to offer drinks in a pitcher rather than separate drinks for everyone yet they we sooooooooo watered down, like I didn't taste any alcohol at all. Also the karaoke system was so hard to figure out. It was all in Mandarin even when we set the language setting to English. The app also all in Mandarin.  It was all just so complicated. The light system was only in 2 settings, disco or all lights on. Yeah me of the waiter guys/bartender/ whatever he was, he was SO RUDE. We just asked him to teach us the basics of the karaoke system and acted like he was annoyed with us! They barely had any songs we wanted. I definitely will not be back.",

If you just want some decent Chinese food to fill you up while you're having a great time singing along with a random pop artist, then Wok and Roll is a good choice. If you're just looking for a good Chinese meal, then I'd probably recommend going elsewhere.",

        "caption": "If I could give them 0 stars I would. There is no information about how to reserve a karaoke room for this restaurant on their website at all. They only list ONE phone number to call. I called a week in advance to make a reservation for my birthday for 25 people. I called and spoke to someone who took my name, number, and reservation time/date and said \"Ok thank you\". Admittedly, I thought that it was strange that she didn't ask for a card or payment, but she said it was on the books, no mention of anything else or a call back or anything. 6 days later (and 2 days before the reservation) I get a text message from a RANDOM number at 1 AM stating that my reservation had not been confirmed and to call ANOTHER NUMBER that I had not seen before (these numbers are not publicly posted anywhere). I called all afternoon and the phone number just rang and rang so I decided to call the initial number from the website back and try to figure out what was going on. Someone answered and said \"Oh the downstairs people don't come in until 4 so call back at 4:30\" Again not sure how someone would know that they have different phone numbers, staff and hours because it isn't posted anywhere and the first lady definitively didn't say anything about that.  So 4:30 swings around and I call the number from the text message, after a while someone answered. I told her that I received a text message to confirm the reservation that I had made a week ago. She stated that she didn't have any of my information and that the large room for that day was already booked from 7pm-2am (basically in my time slot). I then asked her why they would text me if they had already given my reservation away and also why the text came at 1 am 6 days later? She then asked if the person I talked to asked for a credit card etc or stated that I would get a call back and I replied No I was not told that, I was told that everything was good. She then stated \"we did call you on the 8th\" to which I replied no you didn't because my caller ID does not say \"Wok n Roll\" outside of when I called initially. She asks if I can just \"pick a different time\"???? and claims that I must have called the upstairs and not the downstairs portion of the restaurant... Highly disrespectful when something has been planned for over a month and involves over 25 guests. After hearing a plethora of well were booked \"sorry\" I told her that I was no longer interested in celebrating there. After hanging up I checked my call log for any missed calls and there was one (from an unknown number) I don't pick up numbers I don't recognize unless a message is left. AND GUESS WHAT, you guessed it THEY DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE WHEN THEY CALLED and then WAITED 6 DAYS to send a text which indicates to me that they could have sent that text when they missed me the first time. They very clearly had my contact information and the reservation written somewhere but chose to schedule other people instead and then blame their mistake on me. I will NEVER give them my money, period.",

I have so many issues with this place.  Where to begin... 1. the karaoke reservation system.  There is no online system you have to call and make the reservation.  This would be fine if there were any rhyme or reason to the system.  My friend called over a month in advance to reserve a room for her birthday on a Saturday.  They took her name and credit card info.  She was never given a confirmation number or email confirmation.  The recorded what day she wanted incorrectly, tried to call her ONCE, didn't leave a message (she didn't pickup because it was an unfamiliar number), then charged her for a 'no show'.   When we showed up the next day they informed up that we didn't have a reservation and couldn't get one because all the slots were full.  We then had to wait in narrow hallway where numerous staff members (including the bouncer, why he was even in the conversation is insane to me) came out, accused all of us of lying, and blamed all of us for their error.  After about 45 minutes of back and forth we were finally given a time slot 2 hours later than our initial reservation with no kick-backs or apologizes. 2. Prior to our reservation we asked if we were allowed to bring in a cake for the birthday.  We were told we could but there would be a cake clean-up fee.  Fine.  We brought a cake, had to carry it around for that ridiculous 2 hour gap, then when we got to the room we were informed we were not allowed to have it and it needed to be stored behind the bar downstairs until we were done with the room.  We were still charged the cake fee despite not being able to eat our cake?  Not really sure how that is even remotely allowed. 3.  My fianc\u00e9 misplaced his credit card at some point that weekend.  The last place he had it was at the karaoke bar.  He called them and asked if they had his card and if he could come and get it.  After being on the phone for over 20 minutes, being bounced around to several rude staff members, they told him they found his card and he could get the next day.  We drive 25 minutes out of our way to pick up his card only to be told THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT.  I do not understand why he was informed that it was in they're possession when they clearly did not have his card.  Overall EXTREMELY negative experience with all staff members.  We had a party of 20 people and everyone there was extremely disappointed and will not be returning.  The staff are disorganized and were rude to us on multiple occasions.  Will not be returning and will discourage anyone from frequenting this place.  Don't waste your time or money.  There are much better bars in Chinatown.",

We had our food delivered to our hotel so we clearly asked for plates since we are in a HOTEL. No plates were provided, we had to eat off the lids.
