Not a good choice. We had the appetizer skewers $13 which were delicious and the chocolate tahini cake $11 which really surprised us flavor wise. We did not leave feeling overly full which is good since we were there for the show.  I highly recommend it for one more reason. Location. It makes getting to the theatre so much easier!!!",

It wasn\u2019t on the menu this time when I went to see Hamilton but I had something just as amazing.  I had the house made bologna sandwich. \ud83e\udd6a First of all, I can\u2019t believe these people are making their own bologna. Second of all I can\u2019t believe how absolutely delicious it was.  I\u2019m already looking forward to coming back next year. Everything I\u2019ve tried here has been exceptional. If you\u2019re going to a show at The Kentucky Center you should really try out their restaurant. It\u2019s really one of my favorite places to eat when I have the opportunity.  Job well done, Scene!",
