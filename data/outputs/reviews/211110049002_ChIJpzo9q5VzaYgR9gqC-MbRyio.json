Being from parts of Michigan where the Arab/Middle eastern communities are quite large, Mediterranean food is abundant and delicious and one of my favorite kinds and of food and I was not disappointed here. Portions are great and it is reasonably priced.  The only thing I will say is I was not the biggest fan of the tabouleh, as its one of my favorite dishes, and it just didn't hit like everything else did. But otherwise. Meat is juicy and tender, hummus is delicious, the greek salad dressing is *chefs kiss*  Definitely my new favorite go to for this type of food. Don't even want to consider trying others.",

Tikka Lamb was medium-well vs medium-rare like I get back home... but it was legit the most flavorful lamb I\u2019ve had in years. PERFECT. If they could replicate that lamb every time? I\u2019d choose it over my Detroit spots every time - and that says a lot. Baklava was 2nd best of my life too. I have no need to try any other Arabic food in Louisville while I\u2019m here. The gentleman who rang me up was also very attentive and cleaned a table the moment a man got up from drinking some drink. Guy ate fries, had a drink, made no mess - but the restauranteur promptly cleaned the table AND chair. We need more places like this in America.",

The place is very clean and sharp itself. I ordered the Shoah Tawook sandwich, the chicken is cooked well, I also like the lime in the sauce that is present. The wrap itself is hard and the vegetables were okay. I didn\u2019t understand the garlic sauce on the side. There are other falafel restaurants in the area, I appreciate the competition, but it\u2019s not enough to derive the crowd from the existing businesses. Worth trying and that\u2019s it.  Edit: I am updating my review, upon further inspection I see a lot of 1 review profiles all giving 5 stars, I don\u2019t appreciate fake reviews as it\u2019s dishonest to the customers just looking for advice on the restaurant so I am changing my rating from a 3 to a 1.",
