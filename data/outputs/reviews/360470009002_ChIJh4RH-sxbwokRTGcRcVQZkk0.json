Another time, one employee was cleaning the counter as a line formed. We all waited patiently as she told us someone would be right with us. Five minutes later, nothing. Then she yells, \"HEY!\" to the two employees giggling down by the cash register and finally we get service.

Despite it being dry, it is flavorful and well seasoned.  Once you walk, on the left consist of pick up orders. There are limited tables but plenty of seating area in forms of stairs. Utensils and straws are biodegradable. There are also no bags given to hold your meal.  The servers were patient and helpful towards me as it was my first time trying sweetgreen.

        "caption": "Apparently food gets \"stolen\" here if you order delivery. The order that i was suppost to pick up got \"stolen\" twice. Both times i tried to pick up they said they were remaking it. I dont know if it was a fellow postmate or another delivery guy but It made me waste an hour of my 8 delivery bonus before 9pm. Not only did it do this but at the time, i already had an order for someone from another place and that order ended up being affected. They put pick up items on this pick up wall and then just leave it unsupervised. The staff here does NOT check order names or numbers. Anyone can come in staring into their phone and just grab any order.  Edit: I changed my rating all the way down to a 1 star because this is a severe problem that makes not only me look bad as a postmate, but this makes postmates look bad and decrease the likelihood of people choosing postmates. Not only did I not make the 8 deliveries before 9pm for my bonus, but I got a penalty on my account that temporarily blocked me from getting deliveries with a warning of more severe penalties.",

One, store NEEDS a clear sign where the line starts, being it was my first time in that location I just followed where the others are lining up. For some reason, one of the staff bluntly told my father and I to stand after the line and let a lady skip us when we were already waiting for serval minutes. I wasn\u2019t the only one unclear about the line, as new customers walking in did the same mistake. Second, the staff could be more knowledgeable about their products... thus, will avoid misunderstandings in the future. LASTLY,  cleanliness can be improved immensely. Coming from the industry as a chef, I can tell there was a lack of caution to sanitary stations... it wasn\u2019t even rush hours. That being said, my father did not eat his $14 salad. Probably won\u2019t be coming to this location again.",
