They were decent but there is nothing amazing about them.  I ordered the pork for my main course. On the menu it is described as a \"Brined bone-in chop, cherry chutney, wild rice with asparagus and bell pepper\". When my food arrived there was no cherry chutney, half of my wild rice to burt/hard, and there was not q bell pepper in sight.  I asked my waitress about the chutney. She told me they where TAKING it off of the menu so they are no longer making it. That is information that should have been relayed upon my ordering of the pork chop. Not to mention it is still printed on the menu. She did go to the kitchen and get me a bowl of the chutney which I then plated myself.  I did not even mention the hard rice nor the lack of bell peppers.  The pork itself was pretty good. Once I got closer to the middle of the chop it seemed to me to be under cooked.  I asked the manager and she informed me that they cook their pork medium well. I asked if they could cook it for another minute or so. She said she could not due to covid but she COULD microwave it lol...which made no sense to me but ok. If you can take my plate/item back to the kitchen to microwave it why then can  you not just put in back on the grill or in a skillet.  At that point I just asked for a togo box and the check.  I live very close to this restaurant and was really looking forward to sharing it with my friends. We may still visit for wine but definitely not the food.",

It is the ideal place to impress a special someone, or in my case, a co-worker who also enjoys awkwardly running on sidewalks in the dark to a restaurant a half-mile away. Despite our slightly sweaty \u2018brows, they were kind enough to seat us at a candlelit table in their upper-level dining space. Although they have a \u201cfancy\u201d menu, there are so many options to choose from for both a custom charcuterie board or individual entrees, and I think most people will find their menu rather approachable. So whether you are trying to impress a new date or enjoy a post jog meal, this is a great place to enjoy a pint, glass, or various assorted meats and cheeses.",

I get there and the host had the worst attitude and was rude and when mentioned that it was for a special occasion, it was not even once acknowledged it was that individuals birthday. We didn't get prompt service. The food was cold and was sent back. You expect a hot meal not cold one. Typically, people go for the experience of dining and good service for a special occasion and while not comparing this place to an Applebee's and have dined in finer settings for a special occasion where even a plate of dessert was brought not once did our server do that or better yet have checked on us in a more prompt manner. I will never recommend this place and I will never go back either. It is one of the slowest and poorest service I (we) have ever experienced. I'm sure Retreat Gastropub or other gastropub competitors would fare much better in service. Cake or no cake. Fine wine or no fine wine and expensive cheese and fancy risotto or not. Their host would have welcomed them rather than with an attitude and given them proper service. I wish I would have went to Rosalitas.",

Even worse, when I wanted to by wine by the bottle and asked to taste it, he said that they do not have open bottles! Lol!  We got wine by the glass; Rose and Pino. Both cheap brands but cost almost as much as the bottle itself in an alcohol store. Rose 4/10. Red 5/10.  Their cheese assortment was not great either. The waiter could not recommend any of them. Cheese 3/10.  Olives super salty and very soft. Not good for serving 2:10.  Will not visit again.",

I am assuming the high rating is mainly due to people's fixation with alcohol and longing for a sense of status. Because I ordered online I have no bias based on atmosphere, presentation, nor service. Buying freshing and putting it on a plate could be their thing...this establishment failed at cooking.

However, none of them have come anywhere close to the quality of food and service I experienced at Bridge. I sat at the bar, as I'm a bartender and it's my preferred place to sit. The bartenders were wholly knowledgeable in the beer and wine they serve, ready to make educated recommendations as needed, and were extremely fun to talk to. They really know how to make someone feel at home, which is a big plus. All the food came out perfectly cooked, presented well and was absolutely delicious. I had the soft pretzels as an appetizer and the NY Strip club for my entree, with the rosemary gorgonzola bacon bread pudding as a side. I still dream about that bread pudding - imagine your grandmother's holiday stuffing on steroids.  Bridge definitely changed my mind about the all-encompassing views I've had of Bailey's Restaurants since before and after my tenure working for them. 5/5, great experience.",

The summer sausage with jalepino was pretty decent and so was the sage cheese.  We also ordered the roasted pork salad. It's not the kind of salad I usually go for, but it was pretty cool. The texture of the pork was perfect! Feta cheese isn't always my favorite on a salad, but there was some kind of sweet granola that helped to create the perfect flavor combo!  Overall, I wouldn't mind going back and trying new cheeses and meats and getting an even bigger cheese plate. I probably wouldn't get that salad again, be maybe I'd give one of their sandwiches a try!",

I had a little bit of time to kill before catching my Amtrak back to Dallas, had just come off of four days of cycling on the Katy Trail, and wanted a martini which is how I found this place. Long story short, they opened their doors, let me bring my bicycle in, and even found a special spot in the neighboring gallery for it. I offered to change clothes (I was still my cycling gear on), and they told me they didn't care about that! I sat at the bar, was given a tasty beverage, and amazing customer service from all of the staff.  Thank you so much for your hospitality!",
