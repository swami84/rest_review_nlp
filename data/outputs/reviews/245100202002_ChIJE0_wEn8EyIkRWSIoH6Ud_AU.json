I purchased sweet Italian sausage from them, and checked the ingredients label to make sure there was no red pepper, as I have a food intolerance. When I brought the product home, I found it was full of red pepper. My wife contacted the company to politely suggest that they use a bit more detail in their ingredient labels so people like myself aren't disappointed. She received a call back from one of the Ostrowskis in which he condescendingly explained to her that she didn't understand how ingredient labels work and that it's essentially our fault for buying a commercially prepared product while also having a food allergy. He offered no assistance with helping us navigate their product line or anything else remotely helpful - it seemed the most important element was his own ego. We were pretty browned off from the experience and likely won't buy their products again. It's a shame, really, as I'd really like to be able to support a local business.",
