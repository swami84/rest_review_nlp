Which honestly I was more than happy with, but the place is pretty big so even on a busy night it may not feel over crowded.  As for the food, unfortunately was not a fan of the bulgogi at all. The mac and cheese was good however the wings are the real reason to come. Absolutely delicious, super crispy and very flavorful without being covered in messy sauce. Definitely worth a stop in to give the wings a shot.  There is a bit of a wait time for the chicken, and it is a tad bit pricey. But for the area you're not finding much cheaper. Overall if you're not in a rush and want some tasty Korean fried chicken stop by to give em a try.",
