We were in town for a business meeting and found ourselves 2.3 miles away from this place, so it was the reviews that made us drive here in pretty heavy traffic. And the reviews were right! My \ud83d\udc14 and my friend's \ud83e\udd69 fritters were tender, full of flavor and plentiful. The presentation was great, as well, but it took a while to come out even though there were only three or four other guests in the joint.  Decor was festive this time of the year, but in general, the owner has created a cozy, rustic and somewhat intimate atmosphere with some barn-found items on the walls and furniture.  One other, totally food-unrelated observation about the bathroom - I don't love New York, but since I come here relatively often, I am always in awe and impressed by the ingenuity and ability to use any/all available space. You can only turn 180 degrees in the bathroom and you have to keep your hands tight to your body, but it has everything you need to get the business done - just tiny! The tiniest sink, soap dispenser, even mirror was shrunk to fit the space. Bravo! You can count on me being back, if I find myself back in Brooklyn.",

I ordered the classic eggs Benedict with prosciutto which was absolutely delicious. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was tangy and creamy, exactly how you'd expect. My friend had their special omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and mozzarella, also cooked perfectly and was very tasty. Service was prompt so whether you need a quick meal or want to relax this could be a great food/drink option. I had a drip coffee which completed the meal nicely. I will definitely plan another meal here when I'm visiting the area again.",

Poor management my advice if you can't make it by 9am when the restaurant open chances are you will have to wait a very long time to even get your order in. Hope that the management will place more than 1 server during this busy brunch hours.",

When I specifically asked nicely if it would be done Tuesday or Monday I wasn\u2019t sure why I couldn\u2019t have my party on Monday  or Tuesday but overall the food was good I dont mind paying a lot for good quality food but also the dishes are small portioned and I dont recommend having a party here if your party is hungry unless your willing to spend hundreds ! I\u2019ve been here with my husband and daughter and son in law on Saturday nights and the service is 99% wonderful all the time so I was surprise that the service wasn\u2019t as good I do recommend this place if your going with another server or another day or if you don\u2019t have parties to host BTW FRIDAYS NIGHTS ARE THE WORST !

The food doesn\u2019t take long at dinner unless you order something that\u2019s going to take long but I\u2019ve been going on weekends either Friday or Saturday and I\u2019ve had the best service from this new girl very attentive and always has conversations with us and it makes our wait for the food go faster !  the owner of the place  is more attentive to I\u2019m glad he  added another person to the team because it\u2019s better to have more than less and I\u2019m happy the owner has his liquor license now it\u2019s even better !

Everything I desired to order i was informed was actually $4-$5 more than what was advertised.  My waiter began to explain that he did not make it, it is the powers that be. So I asked to speak to the man in charge... but he was far too busy to tend to his patrons where there were only 4 patrons in the establishment.

I ordered the Zona Burger(medium) and it was excellent, juicy, flavorful, and served on a noticeably delicious brioche. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had, and the size of the patty was very impressive, if that matters for your preference of burger. Served with a very appetizing, modest(not meager), delicious side salad, with a light, awakening vinagrette dressing. Quite palatable.  The service at the bar was attentive and not intrusive. I felt very relaxed while in this intimate, romantically lit(dimmed lights), with lively Latin music and American pop music playing at volumes that are casual and not loud.  This is my third time here, and each time was enjoyable and memorable. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that desires a wholesome, fresh, delicious meal, in a soothing, modern, environment. It feels like a safe haven, an escape from hectic city life.  Five stars!  Sincerely & Mathematically, T. Suhail",

Since it has been idle for many years, the perimeter of the building is surrounded by engineering scaffolding. The castle is also blocked by the roadside trees, and the whole picture can only be seen from a specific angle. The walls are full of graffiti, the outer walls are also stripped of bricks, and the rear is covered with vines. In order to prevent outsiders from entering, the gates are locked with thick chains.

When we walked in, the woman behind the counter greeted us with a smile and told us to sit anywhere we'd like. The place was not full, so we chose a quiet seat behind the counter so we can eat in peace of course.  Our waitress came over and brought us water, menu and coffees right away. I will suggest that they might want to change the pitcher they bring the milk in. We kept having to ask for refills on milk each time we got more coffee. It would have just been easier to bring us the entire cow (Only half kidding). Anyhow, I was dealing with a slight work emergency and she was still, so patient while waiting for me to decide what to order.  We ordered the Margarita pizza, breakfast eggs, and avocado on toast. The pizza came first and we kinda, sorta devoured it in almost one bite. It was focaccia style, a beautiful crust, good ratio of cheese to tomatoes. (No sauce) I ordered the eggs over easy and that's exactly how they were served. The home fries though, I will be raving about those forever. I'm not sure what or how they make them but those are one of if not the best home fries I've ever had.  The price was perfect too. All around a great breakfast spot and I look forward to returning for more.",
