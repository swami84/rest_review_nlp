After sitting things down, not only did the paper orders show that they were printed at 11:58, but three of my orders were wrong (toppings missing/added and what seemed to be the wrong salad all together). I ran back to replace one, only to realize later that they still got the order wrong. I then called the location to inform them about the issue, and was hung up on.

Let me start by saying the music on this place is extremely loud. which is fine But this Young guy behind the counter was trying to take the order for this elder lady who was having a hard time hearing what the employee was trying to ask her(due to the  extremely loud music) her English wasn\u2019t fluent and I notice that the lady was trying to point out at the stuff that she wanted on her salad and was also trying to explain to the guy what she needed. Instead of him trying to work with the lady he starts yelling at her telling her \u201cI DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WANT OR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, I CANT HELP YOU IF YOU CANT TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT\u201d he at least said this about 5 times with the biggest attitude I\u2019ve seen and extremely loud. This is so disrespectful to tell your customers. Specially your elders The lady was almost crying I understand that sometimes it\u2019s hard specially working in the restaurant business and not being able to understand but it\u2019s your job to work with the customers if you pick this kind of job and you know you can\u2019t work in customer service than maybe you should find a different job. Your job/responsabilty while working in customer service is to serve customers to the best of your capacity and not be ignorant towards people like this guy. Extremely disappointed.",

The wrap I got was pretty good. Mango Mojito Chicken, try if you're there. \"Dirty\" chips were good, water was water etc etc. Here's the real point of the review: Customer Service. Not even my customer service. Not even for an actual customer. More like human decency. Here's the scene: it's the lunch rush. Outdoor tables are becoming more and more premium. Sprawled out on one table, is she homeless? I don't know, but I assume. Large deadlocked gentleman comes out, asks her to leave. She's been there long enough. She mumbles some thing I can't hear. But I know he's got the nuclear option in his back pocket (I'll call the cops). Instead, he returns with a small cup of water. She drinks it, gratefully. A few minutes later, she's gone. No scene. The restaurant got what it wanted in a kind and compassionate manner. Good job guy, whoever you were. Way to be a decent human today.",

        "caption": "Happened across Nalley Fresh on a walk looking for lunch near Inner Harbor.  There was a line out the door which seemed could be a good sign.  I'm from Oregon with the Portlandia mindset and this place had soup, salad, or wrap option with fresh local fillings.  Along with your choice of 'good' Protein item came things like lentils and pumpkin seeds and those fresh veggies in various palate themes.  It was quick (not a sitdown be waited on place), delicious and very satisfying.  Wish we had such a place in Portland.  It doesn't appear to be a chain, but it could be very successfully.  It was near downtown Baltimore so $8 for the wrap + tax.  They also serve Breakfast until 10.  It's more of a grab 'n' go although there is some limited seating.  It's understandably popular.",

        "caption": "I visited Nalley Fresh at 120 E Baltimore Street.  I went there at 1:15 on 11/06/13.  I ordered a salad the guy handling the protein very nice, the second guy also personable, then I get to the lady at the end, just looking at her face she looks as if she is mad at the world, but that I didnt care.  I ask for cheese and blue cheese dressing.  I didnt see the croutons so I asked could I have them, she looked disgusted that I requested something at the end of the line.  Then as I was being rung out at 1:22 , terminal ID:00948357, the lady at the register was really nice, but I noticed my container my salad was in was cracked, I told the lady at the register as she was finalizing my payment, so she told the rude lady at the end, do you know she put my salad in another container slammed it on the counter and literally threw the other container in the trash, not placing it,  threw it.   I was so mad I said out loud if this attitude is what I have to deal with when I come here I will not give them my business anymore.  The strange thing if I saw it, and everyone with me and the people on the line, why did the lady at the register not address the woman nasty behavior.  I will never go back in there and this was my first time actually ordering from Nalleys, but never again I am so upset right now and digusted with the way I was treated by this rude and nasty employee.  This is why I am writing a review online , to let people know , don't ask for anything extra when you get to the end of the line, cause that lady at the end always has a nasty attitude.  If you hate your job then quit, no customer that is paying should have to deal with that type of person.",
