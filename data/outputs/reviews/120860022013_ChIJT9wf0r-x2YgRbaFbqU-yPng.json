I made reservations for a surprise birthday party for my wife and when I arrived to the restaurant the hostess in front of my wife immediately ruined the surprise by stating the rest of the party was inside this was the first of many many more parts of horrible service. The waiter came to our table took half the tables order then came back 20 minutes later to take the other half of the tables order, being that it was my wife\u2019s birthday party she was the last not 1st to be asked what she would like to eat. Once the dinner started to come out everyone was being given someone else\u2019s plate, I ordered the lobster cavelli (which was actually good) but steak was placed in front of me, it was a party of 10 and only 2 of the guest received their correct plate, causing us to have to reach over one another to recover our plates. When this happened I requested to speak to the manager Fabio Palomba, once he came to the table he tapped me on the shoulder and said \u201cWhat is it that you need?\u201d No introduction, extremely distant and passive aggressive. Once I explained my concerns with the service he shrugs his shoulders and say \u201cok I\u2019m sorry but what else would you want me to do\u201d extremely dismissive of my concerns and quite frankly unapologetic. He walked away and for the rest of the night continued to watch and mock our table with the waiters by pointing and laughing. Due to me being upset a friend of ours chose to go speak with the manager, she also stated that he was unapologetic with the service but would send us a shot of liquor to make everything alright. I took offense to this gesture as I felt like he pretty much stereo typed our group as young African Americans who can be bought by given liquor so that we can shut up. We as a group decided not to touch the shots. The restaurant was highly recommended but after this experience I would never recommend a friend to go eat at \u2018SWAN\u2019.",

Kristina, our bartender, was an absolute pleasure. The reasoning for my rating is solely due to their extremely rude manager. I have never experienced such poor customer service.... he was obnoxiously impolite. The server advised us to sit at a table, and shortly after taking our orders, the manager insisted we must relocate & CANCELLED our orders. We awkwardly had to wait around for a table for multiple minutes. After grabbing two bar seats, he once again harassed us and insisted that we must leave because we didn\u2019t order food, WHEN WE DID..... he was persistently harassing us and giving us a difficult time, especially considering that we paid a generous amount for our meals and drinks. Very rude.",

He even coordinated for us to head upstairs and continue celebrating at Bar Bevy! We had an amazing night and it went perfectly considering we were a party of 12! Honestly, I hardly leave reviews but we were all so happy with this manager\u2019s service that I had to grab his name. There were a couple of tables near us and he was the same way with all those tables too. This guy is just really great at his job. Will be going back to Swan!",

I guess since we aren't insta models, they wanted us out of the place ASAP on a busy Saturday, so before we finished our apps, our entrees arrived.  We were done in an hour!  Portions were small and food quality was average for the prices.  I know this is a hot restaurant now, but I am a local and will never come here again.

We ordered 3 small plates to start. The first 2 came out in less than 5 minutes. The corn, corn, corn small plate was excellent. The crunchy popcorn on top of creamy corn was a great contrast in textures, and was very tasty. The tuna carpaccio was also very good, although they should warn you that it is quite spicy.  While we were still eating these, our third small plate, a mushroom pizza appetizer, came out.  This was also really good, with a taste reminiscent of mushroom soup. Unfortunately, about 1 minute after the pizza came out, our main dishes came out. You never really want to see a server stand behind your table holding what should be three hot dishes while they wait for you to try and gobble down your appetizers, but that\u2019s what happened. The main dishes were disappointing and a big step down from the small plates. The Dover sole was doused in a salty sauce, the lobster was very plain and the  ricotta gnudi was boring and mushy. If you go, stick with the small plates.",

It was really annoying and somewhat disrespectful to serve a $27 ravioli dish that only contains 7-10 pasta squares, MINI pasta squares. They charge $5 for NOT FRESH OJ AND $5 for coffee.

Firstly the reservation explicitly noted it was my 25th Birthday, not a single employee acknowledged it throughout the course of service. This was a bummer..what was even more of a shock was the lack of hospitality. We (a table of two) were seated directly in between two large parties completely ruining our personal space as well as any romantic ambience that was left. We thought the food would make up for this all as had been previously (just less than a year). Once again a severe disappointment. The flare and show of service had fizzled to a mediocre display (ex cutting of the ceasar salad) and the food quality was sub-par to say the least. Ravioli was both undercooked and served cold..as we were still finishing appetizers. Employees continually reached over the table to clear dishes while we were still eating, and to top it all off.. a mandatory service charge (explaining why service was so poor, they do not care because they know they are still going to rob you). Overall, not at all worth the money and will definitely not be returning to Swan. Sorry Pharrell, stick to music, the restaurant industry is clearly not your forte.",

When we sat down came the server and when we asked for the Spice menu, he said that there is no available on sunday, we told him that we saw it on the web and also already asked to the hostess and she said yes. Well, he never came again, and send another server, this one was nice. The thing is that the cocktails are so pricey $17.00 for one that I choosed, the glass is tiny and they put a lot of ice. You see the price at the end, not when you order it. Also for the beer too, you see the price on the check. They only have three kind of beers. The cocktails list doesn't have the prices. The Miami Spice menu is ok, but they charge you 6.00 more for the octopus and $9.00 for the NY steak, well ant the end is not $39.00 for dinner like the advertising said. And apart you have to choose a side because the steak came alone. The scallops plate was so tiny, only 2 scallops and 2 rare type of broccoli. My husband ate this one and still got hungry! This menu is only for degustation not to get full your stomach.  Other thing that I noticed is that the tax % on the check is not specified. Too much hidden things and at last you pay a lot of money. My first and last visit to this place.",

The place can be much better if not the personnel who meet you on arrival....  Good place to find a LOT of women, all full make up, high heels, in women only groups or alone at the bar.

The cocktails were excellent and the bartenders friendly and knowledge. They made a great Negroni. For appetizers we had the steak tartar, charred octopus, and corn corn corn which was interesting. All were very good. For mains we really enjoyed the ricotta gnudi and the seared scallops, although the pizza left a lot to be desired. They should either improve it drastically or remove it from the menu in my opinion. The design and atmosphere of the restaurant is great with multiple bars, each with their own character and vibe. It's definitely a pricey place for what they offer but most of the food was tasty and well executed. Drinks were great. Service was attentive and friendly. I would return for dinner again or just for drinks.",

However this is the FIRST time in my life where I have seen something similar to what happened last night in this horrible place. We were sitting in the bar (obviously consuming and more than enough because I totally get it that it is a business and they don\u2019t want people there just observing)... There were not stool for the four of us, so ladies were sitting and our couples standing up. I received a call and had to go outside for a moment, in the meantime the rest of the group stayed and as soon as I come back and pretend to sit in the bar, a an afroamerican bouncer without stating a word or asking for permission takes the stool from me right in my nose... my couple tells him that I am using it. He tells us immediately YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. Literally true... we did not use a bad word, we were perfectly dressed, educated people, consuming. We were SO IN SHOCK that we decided not to say a word and leave. There is no way in the world that we would discuss or get into a fight with a bouncer that is completely out of hs mind, authoritarian, uneducated... Being to amazing places in the world has taught me that you need to be served and appreciated when you pay for upscale places. No need to go to places that do not deserve my money, time or good vibes. There are so many wonderful places in Miami please do not waste your time and money in horrible places where people are mistreated just because!!! By the way before getting to this horrendous place I had dinner in Mondolin just a couple of blocks away TOTALLY recommend it... amazing food... incredible service... just sell wine and beer but they totally understand what service and good food is. Trust me you do not go to SWAM.",

But newest \"hottest\" place doesn't always better thats for sure  They have the worst service and the food was subpar at best definitely not at all worth the price! I made a reservtion for 11pm we showed up at @ 10:30pm to have drinks in the bar/lounge.  It took us 30 minutes to get a round of shots, not even drinks but only shots!  The bar tender had taken our order and 2 other people's order, made their drinks first & delivered them to the other people first. Im not 100% certain but I think he forgot about our shots because I had to ask him where our order was and he acted like he was just about to make ours. Then we didn't get seated until 11:50pm, almost an hour after our reservation time. That's ridiculous!  If I make a reservation, I still have to wait almost an hour?! Won't be going back there anytime soon.  I only gave it 1 star for the ambiance and decor.",

As of Feb of 2019, this is THE place to see and be seen. The layout is as unique as its owners. The cuisine is as unique as its owners. Reservations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!! No website posted as of yet, so just give them a call to secure a spot. The restaurant itself stops seating and taking orders at midnight, but the full menu can be ordered throughout so long as yu have a table.  What we had: Corn, Corn, Corn. I'm told is Pharrell's favorite. It is legit awesome. Corn polenta with pieces of corn and salty popcorn on top. I knw sounds off. But its so dayum goooood. The popcorn give it that extra special kick!  Ricotta Gnudi. It's a relatively large potato pasta stuffed with cheese. It's like gnocci on steroids. The seductive aroma of this dish had everyone within reach asking what it was. The smell had just opened our pallet to how freaking delicious it is. A MUST try!  Swan Cesar. 1st of all, it comes out stacked, with rosemary breadcrumbs on top. They then chop it tableside. The salad is fresh, green and packed with flavor. I tell yu, if salad tasted like this and like this, I mean always. I would eat salad literally everyday! If yur watchung what yu eat and opt for a salad at a restaurant, believe me, yu won't feel left out.  Rigatoni. The presentation is fantastic, its stuffed with mushrooms and on top, apricot and spinach. I personally, would rate this my least favorite item of the night. But, I will say, while it did nothing for me, I believe others will enjoy it.  Fantastic people watching, some of MIA's best looking fashion forward people hit this new spot. So, in essence, bring yur A-Game and be ready to eat! :p",
