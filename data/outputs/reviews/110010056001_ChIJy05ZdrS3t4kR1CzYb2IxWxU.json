With exceptional rave reviews on the filet (on of the best filets I've ever eaten in regards to flavor, portion, tenderness and cook).  Adding to the experience was the attentive, friendly and high class service.   After a great day of sightseeing we all agreed the meal at Jardenea was the highlight of our trip.

The area was nicely decorated, the Frette napkins and small jars of preserves/jams made the place feel fancy. We both ordered the Altantic as we were starving and Lapin got coffee. The coffee was the same coffee they have for free (for guests staying in the hotel) in the lobby before 10am. The food came out fast and was hot. Although, we were told by the server that everything is prepared ahead and it is just served upon ordering. This was incredibly off-putting given the price. How can it say two farm fresh eggs any style but I could only get scrambled and not eggs benedict like I wanted...? The service was meh at most. After bringing us our food and coffee no one came to check in and the plates were left there when we got the bill. We paid the bill and left and the plates were still on the table.",

I went to Restaurant week dinner and everything we tasted was delicious.  I had the kale salad which I couldn't stop eating. The marcona almonds, the parm, the bacon, and the gorgeous kale leaves had the perfect crunch and texture. I could go on and on, but I wouldn't get to the other dishes we had. My mom had the beet salad, which she raved about. I had the salmon while she had the sea bass. Both dishes were amazing. While I normally think of salmon as a light dish, the leek soup accompaniment made this rich and delicious.  If you come back during the summer, I would definitely encourage you to try the tomato salad as it looks amazing.  Jardenea also has a pre-theatre menu from 5-7 which is worth checking out. Overall, this is a great place, parking was easy to find and it is a few blocks from the metro.",
