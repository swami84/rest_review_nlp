We waited 15 minutes to be seated even though there were empty tables for us. Took almost 40 minutes for fried calamari, potpourri mussels and Tom kha to come out and it was all cold when it finally did. After having to wait another 10 minutes to get the servers attention he was able to fix the problem.  Once warm the calamari  was really good, tom kha decent and mussels only okay. We ordered Pad thai to come out after the soup and apps. Flavor was good, but noodles were very greasy and extremly salty.  We ordered a couple mixed drinks from the bar, which were surprisingly good and perhaps the best part of the meal.  Would not reccomend to a friend and I will likely not be back.",

You have a pathetic liar on staff and doesn't care about your customers... I'm sure if it wasnt for the place upstairs  closing you wouldn't have had those 3 tables to begin with.

The service was very inattentive. I had to catch my server's attention at least three times for things she'd forgotten to bring and for the check. I never got a refill on my water, and it took her a long time to pick up my check. The restaurant was not busy, probably because it was Easter. A mediocre experience never to be repeated.",

Recently two of us walked into the empty room for lunch (there were only two other customers there) and the waitress led us to a small two-person table. We asked to be seated in a bigger one because there was like no one else in the room...though approved, she hesitated a bit and rolled her eyes. That was acceptable but the next day we went there again, it was a different waitress, and in the end, she charged us an extra 18% service fee that we had never had before. We called her about the issue and she came to take at the bill for about half a minute, then went \"you never had it before?\" We said no and then she went back to take off the extra service fee. Unbelievable! Never went there again...",

We ordered the koh moo yang or grilled pork with sticky rice as an appetizer and received an unnamed beef dish that we didn't order. When we told our waitress what happened, she proceeded to tell us off that we didn't pronounce the grilled pork dish correctly and blamed us for the mistake. By this point, our entrees had already arrived so we cancelled the grilled pork appetizer. At the end of the meal, the waitress dropped off a carryout bag with the beef dish that we never ordered and we were charged for the grilled pork appetizer with no explanation or follow-up. There are much better Thai restaurants on the block that won't treat their customers with the disrespect that was shown at Thaitanic.",

I had Lemongrass shrimp soup, which shared the fatal flaw of most saucy shrimp dishes: the tails of the shrimp still had their shells. I understand that the shelling is done in a processing plant somewhere and restaurants don't want to invest hours taking off the remnant, but honestly, for a *soup* it just doesn't work. I had to reach into the oily soup and physically pry off the shell of each shrimp tail. I won't be doing that dish again.  Good service, not too crowded, prices are pretty good (I had a $15 entree and a $7 dessert).",

I (an Indian who loves tongue/throat burning hot/spicy food) am not sure how \"authentic\"ally Thai the food was, but it was one of the tastiest Thai dishes (\"Birds Nest on Fire - Chicken\" is the name of the dish) I have ever had. I had specifically requested them to make it as spicy as possible.  Usually most restaurants make spicy, by just adding a lot of red peppers and nothing else!  my 3 other colleagues also loved what they had (i don't remember what they had otherwise I'd have named those dishes too)  A note about the men's restroom: It was very clean, and if I were to enter it blindfolded, I'd think that I am entering a massage room filled with fragrances and scented candles!  A restaurant that has good restrooms, will (most probably) never let you down in terms of food quality and service!  These guys deserve the 5*s!",
