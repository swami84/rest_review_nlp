When we got home, we realized that the wrong order was placed in our backseat. Since we live in the suburbs, we weren't planning to drive to the city to correct our order. Sure, I was disappointed but I understand that restaurants are working hard to adapt to the influx of online orders, new policies and procedures, etc.  When I called to inform them of the mixup, I expected a refund. I didn't expect their response: Someone would deliver our order to our house in the suburbs! I was overjoyed! An hour after I place the initial call, our order had arrived ... and was delivered by Donnie Madia! He was so gracious!  Thank you, Donnie & Publican Quality Meats! You have lifelong customers - which is good because we LOVE all of your restaurants! \u2764\ufe0f",

The menu items and meats look wonderful, but I don't have time for \"out to brunch\" when I am there, so I load up on the cookies to take back home.  Truly, the best and most INCREDIBLE cookies I have ever had, and I am a fantastic baker myself.  The brown butter dark chocolate chunk and the milk chocolate walnut cookies (the latter made only occasionally, unless ordered in advance) are life changing.  The olive bread is truly artisan quality.  So, who needs brunch when you can go home and make a killer sandwich with that awesome bread, and feast on cookies for dessert?  The counter people are not so much on the ball, but Molly is fantastic.  She takes care of business, \"knows her stuff\" and packs your order up like the true professional that she is - nothing breaks on her watch.",

The Publican is an open wood filled dining hall with booths and communal tables which spans the length plus smaller round standing tables. I think I was already smitten with the charm of the this place.  Will the food be the same?  To start the pork Rinds was crunchy and slightly spicy. Light and airy. The Potted rillettes was wonderfully light and the cranberry add the right amount of sweetness. Second, was Black Bass thinly sliced was light and fresh. The Prochetta with the crispy outer skin and slightly fatty was decadent and delicious. All while, our server even in the crowded filled hall was still attentive. I can get use to Chicago service unlike New York City.  In my hometown this would be overrun by boat shoes loving, flood waiting rolled up pants, filled with plaid and pastel wearing hipsters but thankfully in Chicago it was just people who enjoyed the fun but loud ambiance and food that is imaginative.

However, I was pleasantly surprised when their catering manager Jessica worked with me and had my order for 15 people processed and approved by the kitchen in under 10 minutes. She estimated delivery time (reasonably) to be around 12:45 or 1, however the food had arrived and been set up in the kitchen by 12:30! Unsurprisingly, the lunch received rave reviews (it is Publican meats after all) but the service was really above and beyond anything I expected. This place is truly a 5 star establishment.",

I stopped in around 11:30am on a weekday to grab lunch for my fiance and some of his coworkers. I placed the order for some meat and cheese plates to go, as well as their pork belly gyro. Everything was sliced and made to order, so I had to wait around for about 15 minutes, which was fine by me knowing that everything was being freshly prepared. The atmosphere is small and quaint, very much a butcher's shop meets a deli/diner. It started to get busy as I was leaving, which was the peak of the lunch time rush. I'd definitely recommend coming earlier than later in order to snag a seat or dodge the long wait times for to go orders. As for the food, everything was fresh and delicious, and it held up well on a cold 15 minute commute. Definitely do yourself a favor and order the pork belly gyro for a delicious and filling lunch!",

If you slice up a cajun boudin and pan fry it, then throw in half a beer, some butter, and some giant clams from the fish market down the block... Well, you'll never want to eat anything else. I tried their espresso today too. It was so good that it prompted me write this review. PLUS!

They were still fairly busy and the place smelled right so we decided to stay. Our server was named Brittani. We were seated within minutes of walking into the place-however it was nearly 20 min. before our server finally came over to the table.another server had actually come over to let us know that she would be with this as soon as she could, which was fine. When our server did show up to the table she took our order within 25 min. later we got an incorrect order. I also have several food allergies which I went out of my way to explain to her. When the food arrived we did point out that the order was incorrect and she did fix the order with dispatch.we also decided to order a charcuterie plate to accompany our food, and it arrived at the table in time to be a desert.  Being in a service industry I can appreciate working in the hectic situation however our server couldn't have been less motivated to be at the top of her game, much less take our order accurately the first time.  The food was positively outstanding, if I were to rate this restaurant on food alone it would've gotten five stars however we practically had to beg to have our order taken, when it arrived it was incorrect, and I cannot tell you how many times are iced tea glasses were empty for several minutes.  I might be inclined to give this place  another try, but I will drive by to make sure that that server is nowhere in sight... Perhaps that's not such a good idea though because during most of our dinner experience she was nowhere in sight.if you decide to go to this place, I highly recommend the pork belly sandwich-hands-down one of the best things I've ever had in my life (and all of my friends can attest to a food snob I am).  Oh and by the way, the food allergies I told him about-turns out it was and just about everything I ordered(I'm allergic to spicy things-and the spicy pickle that comes on every sandwich is something I ended up being highly allergic to-the juice that soaked up in the bread of my sandwich) making me sick!",

I then had the meatball sandwich, served on Franks & Dawgs lobster roll bread. Don't get confused, the menu mentions a couple items served on Franks & Dawgs lobster roll, but it's just the bread. No lobster. Anyway the meatballs were really good as were the toppings and the (very buttery) roll.  They have a good variety of beverages of both the alcoholic and non types. The beer and wine prices were great (for the location and a place of this caliber), although I did not indulge on this visit.  The seating is communal and very tight. It's a popular weekday lunch place and you will be elbow to elbow with the person next to you. We sat down right away, but it would've been nice to have a little more room.  Great food, great value.
