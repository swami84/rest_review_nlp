The restaurant is always clean and the staff is very attentive. I've had the French Angus burger, delicious and juicy medium rare with a side of the most scrumptious sweet potatoes fries. I've also had the Croque Monsieur which consist of thick country bread with ham  and cheese topped with this creamy Bechamel sauce. This restaurant for me, is a hit! Regular customer.......",
