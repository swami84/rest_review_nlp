        "caption": "(Translated by Google) There were some major snoring (snoring?) services, and I ate the first time here, but I was quickly compensated during my second visit after communicating with management. Food and service were spectacular during the second visit. Veal smashed into Milan, probably one of my favorite dishes forever. Thin smashed but still so moist and juicy. And, if you can manage to leave a bit of leftovers, it's perfect for broilers to heat up for two rounds of day/night/lunch. Tomahawk ribsteak is good. It is fully cooked but not the best cut, especially for quality meat related restaurants. But it is enough. The only (special) Dover is fully cooked. I usually don't like the fish a huge fan, but I gorged on eating this. Overall, quality Italy has almost no mistakes, and some great hits. Don't come here to Milan without ordering beef!
