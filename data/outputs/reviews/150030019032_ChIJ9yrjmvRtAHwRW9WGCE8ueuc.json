We had the wagyu loco moco, kalua pork loco moco, very berry souffle pancake and French toast. The pancake was fluffy and light. I really enjoyed the kalua pork loco moco - it's the perfect comfort dish with a smokey flavour. The Wagyu loco moco was essentially a burger over rice (not sure if it was really any different from the regular beef loco moco which we didn't try).  Would come again/recommend stopping by.",

I had an omelet which was great but my wife's apple souffle pancakes were the star and I cannot recommend them enough!",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) It was good. I ate pancakes and took Locomoko home with me, but both were delicious. The clerk can speak Japanese. The menu is also in Japanese, so you can order with confidence even if you can't speak English. It's important to note that all waiting customers are waiting in line outside, but first go inside, write your name on a piece of paper, and wait for someone to be called outside. If the time zone is dinner time when you go, you will probably line up. In my case, I was unlucky and the front customer was a group of about six people, so I had to wait a long time because the people in the back line could not enter until those people entered. However, this was just a lot of bad luck, and I take it as a plus that I should keep the order in which I wrote the names without worrying about it. It means that the time you can enter may change depending on the previous customer. You probably don't give priority to the people behind you. After ordering, it will take some time to arrive. In my case, I waited for about 30 minutes with two kinds of pancakes. Since the amount of pancakes is large, some people may leave them, but if you can't eat them, you can give them a container and take them home. As mentioned above, you can also order a whole takeaway.  General comment: 4 stars There are no complaints about the clerk or the food. The taste was delicious and Japanese was OK, so it was delicious without any trouble at the store. However, if it takes a long time to enter the store, it may take a considerable amount of time including the time it takes for the ordered item to arrive. In my case, it took about an hour from lining up outside to receiving the order. In addition, it is hard to say that the store is large. I think this is the main reason why many people are lined up.

However, we were most disappointed by the service we initially received. We arrived at a busy time, so it was understandable that we would not be seated right away. They have a sign at the front that asks guests to wait outside and not crowd the restaurant, but no sign-up sheet. We were unsure if they saw us, so we went in and stood for a bit, and NOBODY acknowledged we were there, met our eyes or even just said a quick \"hello\" or \"aloha\" \"we will get to you soon\". We sat outside for probably 25 minutes without any interaction with the restaurant staff. We didn't have anywhere else better to go, so we did wait, but we were quite ready to get up and leave. Once we got a table, we were also served AFTER  another table who came in after us. Staff attitude was actually quite pleasant when we finally did interact with them, but not enough to remedy the negative experience previously.",

We were seated right away, then ignored for a full 15 min before my husband had to wave someone down for service. The place was mostly empty at this point with 3 waiters just standing around, and it's a small place so it was truly baffling how terrible the service was. After ordering, the food came out relatively fast. I thought it was way overpriced based on what you get. They also screwed up my husband's order but it wasn't worth making a big deal out of it. They never came back to check on us or refill our waters or coffee. Had to wave down another waiter for the check. We left as quickly as possible after that. Would recommend avoiding this place.

We ultimately had a 40 minute wait to be seated. This was at 9am. . I had the Loco Moco with the eggs on the side, plus a side of fries to use up the gravy. It was fantastic.  The hamburger steak was large and delicious, the gravy superb, the rice soft and gravy-coated. Yum. . The fries looked to be coated in some dusting impervious to liquid (taro?), so they didn't soak up the gravy.  However, they were crunchy with a pillowy soft interior.  Perfection. . Everyone else raved about their food.  I had some bacon that was delicious, plus some Spam. . I've waited on longer lines for worse food, so this was worth it.",

Felt like I was eating at home, decor and everything was very homey and beachey at the same time. The food is a little pricey for a small eatery ($12-20), but well worth it! We\u2019ve never had souffl\u00e9 pancakes before and these were bomb! We ordered the berry one with ice cream and whipped topping & took 3 of us to finish it. Texture is like angel cake but much smoother & not as sweet. The bbq chicken I ordered was perfect! It\u2019s a little small so it does get crowded and you can hear everyone else\u2019s conversation around you. The only reason why I wouldn\u2019t give this place a 5 is, parking was a little difficult and the waitresses did not come to us very often, we had to call our waitress over when we needed something. One of the other waitresses did not look very friendly either, a little smile goes a long way!",

I ordered 9 $ crispy coconut shrimp, 16 $ souffle pancake with apple cinnamon, and 15 $ souffle pancake with coconut sauce and macadamia nuts. The souffle pancake is fluffy and very delicious! ! The coconut sauce was sweet and delicious, and it was delicious in a pancake with less sweetness. The most delicious pancakes I have ever eaten. I also like it more than Bill's. It was not so crowded and it was good to be relaxed. It was a feeling that both the Japanese and local people came to the shop. The reason why there is one less star is that unfortunately there was a hair (of suspicious part) attached to the fresh cream attached. In particular, I did not tell the clerk (because it was troublesome) and I took a large part of it and ate only the other.

I guess they are known for their souffle pancakes, which my husband ordered and that was actually delicious.  I dont typically like sweets for breakfast so it was nice to try for a bite, but a whole pancake would probably be overkill.  I ordered the bagel bacon avocado, which was average.  Bagel was kinda soggy from having the egg and stuff on top.  A bit hard to eat as a sandwich, so had to use knife and fork to eat.  Good to try once if no line...",

The interior is surf-themed and a little bigger than some of the other cafes. We still needed to wait for about 10 minutes for a table, but we were able to look over the menu during that time. Overall the service was fairly quick and I would recommend it, especially since it was much closer to where we were staying than some other places.",

We shared fruit souffle pancakes, egg Benedict and banana pudding for lunch on that day, all of which were delicious and in sufficient quantity. It's a bit far from the center of Waikiki and in a confusing place, but worth a visit.

The kids loved the suffle pancakes and the Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict was really good.  The best, however, was the pulled pork  sandwich.  This sandwich is amazing; possibly the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had (and I'm a huge fan of BBQ) anywhere.  Seriously.  Staff was very friendly. Only drawback is that the service was a bit slow, at least by the standards of my \"east coast impatience\".  Well worth the visit and highly recommend; would go back in a heartbeat.",
