        "caption": "Very busy location. Was looking for a vegan dish and when googled this place popped up. I ordered the bbq shrimp and cauliflower grits (not vegan) and my friend ordered the Pacific rim salmon with steamed vegetables and sweet potatoes. The total with 2 can teas was $33.63. I tasted  the salmon and it was very bland and taste boiled, but the veggies were ok (no seasoning) and the sweet potatoes were good. My dish took some getting used to. Taste more like Mediterranean food. The bbq definitely did not taste like bbq sauce.  The shrimp were not too rubbery. The cauliflower grits were a bit watery but were really good. The sauce is spicy but not overbearing. The tea taste more like pine tea and airfreshner. I would definitely recommend the salads and pizzas. Love the outdoor seating with spring air and covid free. Staff was friendly. Bathrooms clean. Indoor seating as well.",

I was hung up on after holding for a few minutes on the first try. Second attempt after being put on hold again, I held on for 5 minutes and decided to just go to the store to place my order. I had the 'bowl' if Turkey chili (it was more like a cup) for $5.95 and I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap for my mother. She enjoyed her wrap and the chili was very good.

I ordered the stuffed bell peppers with the roasted zucchini, and the roasted sweet potatoes. Everything was great, except the sweet potatoes were seriously under cooked. We asked about them to see if they could be cooked for a little longer, and we're told thsts the way they were cooked. This makes me seriously sad. We were then offered something else to replace the potatoes, which we accepted.....but come on guys! 1. I was forced to throw away food that just needed a smig more cooking, which is wasteful. 2. Y'all are wasting money by replacing what I really wanted to another side. 3. The responce of, \"well that's how they come\" is a bit weak. With all this said, I will still eat here, but it makes me take a second before recommending it to others.",
