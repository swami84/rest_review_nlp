My wife ordered the Crab Cakes with Angel hair and my daughter had Chicken Parm.  The veal was bland and tasted like it was boiled, and the sauce that it came in was watery and generally flavorless.  The garlic bread was completely uninspired, it practically looked like Kroger rolls baked with a thin slice of mozzarella, drizzled with crushed garlic mixed into olive oil.  The crab cakes tasted similar to baby powder.  My wife said that, for the most part, the calamari was good, but agreed on the taste of the crab cakes and commented that her spaghetti was bland, the broccoli was crunchy and the sauce tasted like watered-down tomato paste straight from the can. My daughter commented that the chicken parm tasted like dry tomato paste and burnt mozzarella (there was no flavour to the chicken). This food is not worth the price tag it came with.  It was a $100+ meal.  I will be disposing of most of it as I cannot finish it for how poor it tastes and do not want to imagine its flavour when re-heated.  No stars.  This place needs Gordon Ramsay.  Will never order from here again.  My food was pictured below.",

Arrived at 5:15 and we were seated in the very back corner of the restaurant near a stack of unused chairs and the freezing back door. It was table 601, and we know this because someone had written all of the table numbers in magic marker on the tablecloths. It was absolutely freezing in the restaurant. Everyone in our section ate with their coats on because it was so cold. It took almost an hour and a half for our food to be served. We skipped desserts that we were looking forward to because it took so long. It looked like teenagers were running the restaurant. The servers weren't dressed nicely at all - just random tshirts. Disappointed it has gone so downhill. Very pricey for the experience.",

The salad was waiting for a customer all day long. The spaghetti I couldn\u2019t wait to get to this one .... string cheese has more flavor and flexibility. Talk about crumble in your mouth. I thought it was Alka-Seltzer!!! - Their are no words to describe the veal except for dry. No moisture at all in the meat!! Pieces of toast have more moisture in it. We spent $60 and had to get food  elsewhere. If I could give it zero stars I would.",

What I had ordered had too much salt and the other entree had a sauce that was too soupy. Service was great but I think as we have seen over the years their quality has gone down from great to average food. Maybe I feel it happens to places as they become popular, they become lax and that is not healthy in the long run.",

I had to send back my wine because it tasted like it came from an$8 bottle of wine that has been left open for a few days. The mixed drink I swapped it out for was no better, so avoid those at all costs.  We had the half portions of the lasagna and chicken parmigiana and it was more than enough to fill up two people. The lasagna was not what I was expecting look wise but the taste was pretty good. The chicken piece I had was what can be expected of chicken parmigiana, although my fianc\u00e9 said his piece was very tough to eat. The best part of our meal was the appetizer. It was delicious and something new to try.  We parked on the side of the building off the street and the walk wasn\u2019t too bad. The restaurant was so cold we had to leave our jackets on during dinner. It had the feel of a pub more so than an Italian restaurant. We had two servers which was a little frustrating because one would ask what we needed then never  come back.  Overall I would say it\u2019s definitely worth checking out if you\u2019ve never been. Probably won\u2019t be back though.",

As a former cook, I can tell they re heated a dead piece of chicken in the microwave and then put some cheese on it.. and cooked it even longer!!!! I would only recommend the pasta, thankfully they didn't mess up that part of our order... Both times.  I truly wish it was better because we we've heard good reviews in the past, I guess we got  food when the kitchen was  trying to rush home or something. Even my boss said it's not as good as it use to be..  We will definitely not be eating here again, and I will be disencourage people to visit Dominick's.  Sorry Dominick's.",

Waited 10 minutes for our server to greet us and ask for drink order. Placed appetizer order with drinks and they came out quickly. Only issue is we had to wave down the waiter to order food AFTER we finished our appetizer. Once food came out it was placed on the wrong table in front of other patrons at the table next to us. One of the people at that table caught it and said this isn't ours after 3 of the entrees were already on the table. Guy picks them up off their table then places them in front of us and walks off. Now we had our entrees but nothing to drink bc our waiter has been MIA since taking our order. Ate a quarter of my meal with nothing to drink. Look up and finally find him in a wait room behind the bar on his cell phone texting and laughing. Food was delicious and huge portions but with the lack of service it's hard to justify going back. 2 apps, 4 entrees, and a bottle of wine. Not exactly cheap which is fine but I expect much better service for a place like this. 3 stars bc the food was great.",

The chicken was succulent and I even had plenty to take home. The Portion sizes are more than generous! I was truly amazed at the service and environment of this restaurant. It has a cool relaxing Italian jazzy vibe to it. I made plans to go back on  Fri. 03/22 , and i went on Sat. 03/16/ lol! You all enjoy!",

No one stopped to take a drink order or a food order. Nothing. Like we were invisible. We left. I spoke with the manager who was indifferent to the whole experience. Other than saying, \"sorry\" he didn't say or do anything to get us to stay or come back. No promise of a discount on a future meal. Something. Anything. Got nothing. They didn't care from the manager on down. We left and called Longhorn. Call ahead seating. We arrived, were seated in a couple of minutes and promptly served. Wow. What a difference.",

I was so motivated I momentarily forget that I needed to consult with my husband . Nonetheless, this location is a very close contender due to the wonderful service.

I was a chef for 12 years and hate blasting restaurants but honestly the apathetic execution is forcing me to do this. I normally pay my bill, tip, and don\u2019t come back.  It was Friday and service was not necessarily slow but more so clunky and focused on money rather than experience.  We ordered the cheese garlic bread. Timing was fine but they put garlic chips on a loaf of bread and covered it in oil and cheese and broiled it... the idea seemed great but the amount of garlic was offensive, I don\u2019t think we have ever had left over garlic bread.  I ordered the chicken Alfredo the wife ordered the mushroom ravioli. I feel like it took 3 or 4 minutes to come out, which is not a good thing.  Sauce was runny, the texture of the chicken was precooked and flavorless, and I can get over the chopped up tomatoes (shouldn\u2019t be there but don\u2019t taste like much) but the huge amount of basil(shouldn\u2019t be there and don\u2019t taste good in Alfredo) in the Alfredo made me stop eating after a few bites. By the way the menu didn\u2019t mention basil but did say there would be fried spinach to garnish which were not present.  The mushroom raviolis weren\u2019t very good. It was really disheveled, and just forgetful.  We got the half portions, which were about the normal cost of a full portion at a normal restaurant and they were huge.  It took almost 20 minutes after we stopped eating to be able to pay.",

We were also scouting possible locations for our engagement party, and Dominick's was near the top of that list. It had all the qualifications, it was an Italian restaurant, it looked like it had a private room for special occasions, and it was a bit more high class than Olive Garden. Sadly, the food did remind me of that mediocre restaurant chain. I ordered ravioli, and it literally had more cheese on it, than in it. My fiance ordered spicy chicken and sausage pasta, because she enjoys and often eats spicy food. But not this time, she took about half a dozen bites and couldn't take it anymore. Our waitress, although sweet, always seemed to be in a rush for us to order, and pressured us into ordering alcohol. We really wanted to give this place one last chance, as we had such high hopes for it, so we ordered a cannoli for dessert, which was also not exceptional. If I had ordered this meal at Olive Garden for $50 I would have been satisfied, but not $75 at a privately own Italian restaurant. Needless to say, this won't be the location of our engagement party.",

After checking the restaurants website menu we realized that the menu was the same so a second phone call was place with them...and she dramatically said it was wrong.

Nope the server walks right over to the table just sat and begins waiting on them.

I had to state that we had a reservation and they seemed a little bothered that we were there. Neither of them smiled at us or made some sort of welcoming gesture. As we were taken to our table, everyone sitting was staring at us like we were from some sort of parallel universe. My mother also said she felt she was being laughed at or made fun of by the hosts and another staff member as she walked in. We definitely felt out of place and unwelcome. We did feel tension and I feel it is because my family and I are hispanic and we were the only hispanic family dining there (at least during our visit) It\u2019s very unfortunate because the food was good but overpriced in my opinion. Luckily we had a very kind and attentive waitress. I didn\u2019t get her name but she was very sweet and made us feel better. On a final note, we will never return (not that anyone there would care). First and last time for sure. Very unpleasant and uncomfortable experience!",

Sat at the bar and the bartender Rachel was very attentive and polite. The manager on duty was also very polite and he came by to see if I was going alright. Nice flow in the restaurant, even with a few larger parties and a wait for some customers. Definitely coming back!!",
