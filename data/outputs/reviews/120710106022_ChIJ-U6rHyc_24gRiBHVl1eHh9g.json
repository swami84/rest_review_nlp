We didn't have plans to come here nor had anyone ever mention it to us so what drew us in was literally curbside appeal and a name. Signage was very easy to see and read. We found the parking in the rear easily.  As we entered we were greeted by the hostess which welcomed us immediately. The first impression from walking in was wow this place is pretty cool. Unfortunately, the impression was soured by a group of employees sitting and hanging out across from the hostess stand. My opinion, hangout out of view of patrons.  My wife and I were taken to a small table across from the bar against the wall which gave us a good view to look around the restaurant and get back on the this place is cool vibe. We are greeted by our waitress, Veronica, she was friendly and polite. Veronica asked for our drink order which simple enough for me, I ordered a beer. I wish she would've offered a cold glass but ok the bottle will do. My wife on the other hand had no idea what to drink nor where the drink menu was and fumbled through a flip menu finally ordering a Kiss from Venice not realizing it was a dessert drink. Veronica may be relatively new or just inexperienced but should have helped with suggestions or at the minimum let my wife know it's an after dinner beverage not just give a \"it's my favorite\" comment.  Food order time.. No specials or recommendations from Veronica (heard the specials from the server tending to the table next to us). I love pizza and have probably reviewed several dozen pizzas from places all over. I ordered a New Yorker (mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese), nothing special. The pie was over loaded with sauce so the cheese wouldn't stay on the pizza which kinda ruined it. The dough seemed a bit bland but it may have all been overpowered by the sauce. My wife had the Chicken Parm which she loved and the portion was huge (enough for 2 easy).  The assistant manager came by even though he didn't introduce himself he was friendly and professional. He asked how everything was and cleared some plates from our table.  The dessert. I ordered a cappuccino and that's all I got. When you're a server there's a few basic things to know when a guest orders a beverage which commonly needs sugar added. When you bring the beverage to the table bring the sugar, spoon and an additional napkin. I asked for sugar and I got just that. I had the cappuccino with 2 packs of sugar and had nothing to stir it with.  May seem like I'm being nit picky but in hospitality part of your skills should be to know what your guest needs before they realize they need it.  To sum it up.. The place is cool, food was ok/good and service could have been better. I'll definitely come back and hope for that wow experience I expected when I first walked in.",

I don't recall our server's name but she was knowledgeable about the menu and history of the restuarant. One of the owners was present, he as well as the general manager both took time to speak to my table and ask about our experience. 5stars due to the quality of food, the detail in the decor and overall layout as well as the welcoming attitude of the owner and staff we interacted with. Highly recommend.",

We were going to make the trek to Ft Myers a few months back, but didn't feel like driving 45 minutes.  We were SO excited to see a location opening here in Cape Coral and, let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The service & attention we received (from Franco, Kyle, and Angela) was AMAZING & is exactly what will bring us back (way too often, I'm sure). the drinks were delicious (& we tried several different between us) and the multiple appetizers and desserts were among the best we've had since moving here 2 years ago. We could definitely taste the quality and freshness. We ate way too much, yet it still felt light! We are absolutely excited about the entire experience and can't wait to return regularly. I love that we were repeatedly checked in on.  Service, quality, cozy at home welcoming feel\u2764\ufe0f we HIGHLY recommend!!!!! Edited to add our second visit in 3 days... consistent, awesome service and excellent food once again. Warm welcome as we entered with great service at the bar. This time we had Mike the master of the martini. We challenged him and he made some great variations of the martinis. We continued to try additional menu items. ALL were excellent. This time we remembered to take pics. Thanks to Franco and Kyle who also recognized our return visit and checked in regularly to make sure everything was to their high standards.",

Everything was amazing. The service, the food, everything  was amazing. The atmosphere was energetic, the decor was extremely nice and the food was outstanding.

My daughter got the spaghetti with meatballs and while it was good,  The sauce seemed sweet and lacked salt and Italian spices. The rolls are amazing and the dipping sauce is exceptional. my husband got the chicken Marsala and it was just okay. If you get the Marsala you get a side and my husband chose angel hair pasta and expected marinara sauce to be in it but it was more Marsala gravy. Too much Marsala gravy happening on one plate.",

        "caption": "My husband and I ate dinner here on 9/17 around 7:30.  Walking in we noticed the interior was very neat with  nice lighting and decor. The hostess was friendly and greeted us immediately! We ate outside because we were informed we could smoke on the patio. The man let us know that they had not gotten ash trays yet but he gave us a cup of water to use instead. After being sat I exchanged my menu because there was what appeared to be chocolate across the first one, the second had sauce on it but I just let it go. The patio had a good vibe and was nice for what we were looking for that night. We waited long enough for my husband to take a business call, smoke a cigarette, choose his food  and still no one had come. (probably 20-25 minutes) Eventually we asked the man standing 15 feet away at the togo stand the whole time if we were going to get waited on he said he would figure it out. 5 minutes later our server arrived with cold garlic knots that seemed a bit old. (It was late so Im assuming we just got the end of the night knots, nbd.) I wasn't expecting them and they are complimentary so it didn't really matter. 3 minutes later our drinks were brought out. While we were waiting for our food (which actually came pretty quickly)a man came out and announced that we were not allowed to smoke on the patio because we were not the only table out there.. Which confused me because I was told later that the guy who gave us permission to smoke in the first place had opened 2 months ago with them so you would think he would know the rules. I really don't mind not smoking it was just odd. My husband ordered spaghetti with meatballs which had enough pasta to feed my family of five and two very good size meat balls. I had the three meatball app as my entree. The meatballs were good and even better when you reheat them the next day. The pasta sauce wasn't super impressive which was really disappointing for an Italian restaurant. It was some what sweet and kind of canned tasting (That's coming from someone that grew up on super Italian, home cooked, 3 days to make sauce.)but if your not super sauce picky it was over all a good meal with plenty left over. They have a good size dessert menu and they all look delish! We decided on the pistachio cake as our waiter recommended and I have to say I see myself having many cravings for that cake in the future. He let us know it was on the house because we waiting in the beginning so long which was not necessary but it was  nice that he acknowledged that when he could have avoided it. Actually after getting into conversation with him when he dropped the dessert off he seemed very friendly and you could tell he honestly wasn't being neglectful, he just seemed to have a case of tunnel vision and gets wrapped up in being personable with people not that he was just out smoking a cigarette with a full section. He also was carrying tables by the front door as well as on the back patio. Seemed to be more of a hosting and planning error to me. The manager was also made aware of the situation as he was right inside the glass  door and we could see each other from where we were sitting but he never came out to check on things that's okay though cause his server did a great job at fixing it. He had nothing but praises to sing on the owners management and the overall team and establishment. We asked for our check which again took a bit long but he returned with a peanut butter pie which is not on the menu so make sure you ask about it. The crust is Oreos! He apologized again and said we had to try it cause my husband and him both apparently are huge peanut butter fans. Overall, it didn't turn out to be to bad. They are still very new so everything not being 100% is somewhat understandable which is why I'm still giving it 4 stars. I cant say Id come back for dinner due to the lack of authenticity. I'm looking for outstanding pasta sauce and home made Tiramisu when I choose to go out to eat Italian food. However, I would possibly go back to enjoy the interior bar area for some drinks.",

Great atmosphere it was very loud, I don't know if there's a way to adjust that, we were in the bar area maybe some sound baffling? The staff was on top of everything, very friendly, very impressed. Looking forward to going back. There's a lot of things on the menu that we want to try... not to mention they have a local Big Storm Brewing Cape Coral IPA on draft!\ud83c\udf7b",

We have enjoyed delicious cuisine, well crafted drinks and wonderful service. We have been to the Cape Coral location three times and nevery been disappointed. Our most recent visit we enjoyed the calamari, fried crisply and lightly and very tender, also the mozzarella squares and the tasty marinara sauce. In the past we had the mussels fra diavalo, nicely spiced. We have tried and enjoyed the Alfredo's friend Carlo, a nice creamy serving of chicken, peas, mushrooms with added pancetta. Well flavored. We have had the Napelitano pizza as well, crispy, thin well flavored pizza. Cocktails were well made. My wife enjoyed the Cosmo and I had the Negroni as well as nice house wine. Our waitress on our last visit was Katherine  (Katie). She was wonderful, very attentive and friendly. We enjoyed her company and service throughout our visit. We will return soon, getting hungry writing this review.  See you soon.",

The meatballs that were served  were hard and tasteless. Never had that problem in their Ft. Myers location. The pizza was \" fair\" at best. Just a notch above a frozen pizza you would buy at a grocery store. There was an amazing difference in the level of service too. Seems they have staffed their Cape location with \" young adults\" who have never learned the art of providing good service. Our \" server\" never bothered checking to see how we were doing. I guess the fact that they have service staff at the Cape attired in jeans and company t-shirts says a lot, compared to how the staff in Ft Myers always look clean, presentable and professional. FNL for the Cape location. First and Last visit. We won't be going back.",

I'm sorry but as a manager of a business if your customers get to your establishment before your scheduled closing. Your staff should never declare that you need to rush your order or you won't be able to order, especially as my wife and I are first time customer wanting to try and new restaurant in Cape Coral. Whats sad is we hear the food is really good. But don't go there if you want good service. Kind of sad thats what people say about the place. Will we try it again. I'm not sure.",

One piece was so overbaked, it was difficult to cut with a butter knife.  The other two pieces were raw. Mama's Meatballs might have been good, but they were too cold to tell. Same with the Sausage, Peppers and Onions. My wife thought that there was too much Anise in the Sausage. The Pepperoni Rolls were outstanding. Hot, fresh tasting...wonderful.

We were all pretty excited to give the new place in town a try. After well over an hour wait, to receive our food, 6 of the 7 orders came out. While waiting on my food, I had the opportunity (mostly due to the even longer wait for my stromboli to arrive), to sample some of my groups food. What an absolute disappointment!!!!!!!! The meatballs had ZERO seasoning, the spaghetti, had an almost SpaghettiO sweetness to it, and when my stromboli finally did arrive it was burnt. Everyone at the table had for the most part finished eating what they were going to eat before I even received my meal. More food was left on the table then was eaten. We will not return. Spoke with management at the time......that's an entirely different review. I do not recommend wasting your money here.",

I was  really looking forward to eating from there so I did a pick up order. Sad to say, I was very disappointed in my choice which was a veal parmigiana sub. Not only did it come cold but instead of a real Italian roll, they used a chibata type roll. Not authentic Italian. Also, while the veal in the sub was tasty, there wasn't enough of it. Probably a 75/25 ratio of meat to bread. Not enough sauce to combat the dryness of the bread. My husband had the Stromboli and wasn't impressed either, not enough meat, too much cheese and bread. Soft and soggy bread, no crunch like a Stromboli or calzone should have. I've ordered these items from other restaurants and they are much better and tastier.  I know they are new but no amount of hiccups can change the bread they use and the amounts of filling. I may still try them one more time but based on today's order, it's a tough call.",
