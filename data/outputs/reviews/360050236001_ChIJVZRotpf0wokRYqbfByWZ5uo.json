When i was reassured my order was about to be delivered it still took long. I ended up getting my food at 7:12pm, 3 hrs and 32 min after i placed my order, that is unacceptable. On top of that all they did was threw 3 slices of red velvet cake lol are you kidding me i just spent $140 and all you do is throw me 3 slices. I have been in the food industry for a while and that not how you resolve a situation like this especially if i waited 3 hrs and change for my order. So I spent $140 and the food was not even good and they got some orders wrong as well, appetizer sampler was supposed to come with buffalo wings and it didn\u2019t. One plate was supposed to have bbq chicken and shrimp and it didn\u2019t. The food was warm like room temperature warm. Overall bad experience will definitely not be returning here ever.",

For the kids I ordered fried food such as the appetizer sampler which was fried hard and was soggy, chicken fingers with French fries which were over fried and could not be eaten. Chicken tacos were just nasty dry with no taste couldn't eat. Pepper steak with corn and mashed potatoes was ok. Lobster tail with rice was good. I also ordered red velvet cake which was not in the bag but I was charged for it (they only take cash) I tried calling them and they were no longer answering the phone at all called about 8 times no answer so I lost my money \ud83d\ude12 because I don't exactly live close. My family was very disappointed because we look at the pictures and remember our prior experience and were excited just to be let down so gravely. I spent almost $100 yesterday on this food and it felt like I threw my money away. Be careful when you order from here. I wouldn't order anything that is fried or the tacos nothing that is dry they didn't even send any sauces. And please make sure that you check your food before you leave or your delivery person leaves. Good luck with this place.",

I am very careful to order just anywhere. I read all the reviews n they did not disappoint. I mostly order just the chicken sandwich, it comes with fries. It sounds real simple but you\u2019d be surprised how many restaurants can jack up a chicken sandwich. Fine Food Cuisine makes the best. Every time I go the chicken is seasoned well n cooked to perfection. And the bread is always fresh. When you call ahead be patient because they will not always answer on the first try. They stay busy. If you don\u2019t call ahead be prepared to wait about 20 minutes... maybe longer. The food is cooked to order. I\u2019d wait all day for fresh cooked food. If you are used to the finer foods in life you want to experience Fine Food Cuisine. They are black owned n I support their business whenever I don\u2019t feel like cooking. It\u2019s the best food I\u2019ve had in The Bronx.",

It was so confusing to correct my order before I got it and still they got it all wrong. I ordered wings with Mac and cheese and broccoli, he gives me wings with French fries and the sides on the side of that order. I asked why would you do that. I asked for the wings and told you my 2 sides per each order and they still ruined the order which I was still overcharged for. Place definitely over rated.

The second time I ordered the same thing , stuffed salmon with Mash and green beans only to wait outside under the rain (social distancing)  for them to tell me almost an hour after that theres no mashed potatoes and no one made an attempt to even make any. I was baffled .SO instead of getting money back I said just give me the mac and cheese.  The staff was less than helpful but the owner was nice . Now I said maybe it was a bad day and maybe the staff that day was new so I go for a 3rd for the exact same thing and I can honestly say that the food was horrible and whoever's answered the call I heard him cursing at a customer . The food is no longer worth the horrible customer service. So over it. Ya need to fire the current staff or re train them .",

Its fresh and tasty. However today, was a brand new low. I ordered fish tacos along with chicken quesadilla. Because the food is made to order there's always about a 15 to 20 minute wait. I don't mind waiting for good food. After about 30 minutes I go back inside due to social distancing requirements. The woman taking the order informs me that they don't have fish. WAIT , WHAT? I'm standing outside where I can see you see me see you.  You could  have said to the 5-6 other customers,  Can you tell that guy come to  in for a second. You could have yelled from the counter and I would have heard you. You could have walked the 10 feet and called me in to tell me there is no more fish. Instead of waiting for me to pick up my other order. She is the reason I don't frequent there as much as I'd like to  On a previous adventure to Fine Food there were other patrons complimenting the food but lamenting her service. Y'all have got to do better.",

No apology or anything, just I didn't know when I took your order. Pretty sure at some point someone realized they didnt have what I ordered and still gave me a half order of my dish. Not once letting me know and I assume hoping I wouldnt notice. I ordered because I wanted the mussels and shrimp, I find this very unprofessional and unbecoming.

I recommended this place to 5 people who actually went, sadly 4 out of the 5 had really bad experiences ranging from service, wait, to the actual food. My last time dining there was nothing short of a complete miss. They didn't have the 2 dishes I wanted so I ordered something different. Big mistake. I literally waited 55 minutes for 2 dishes and while I was there a party dining in was complaining about cold food and poor service. One guest in the party actually went next door to the Bodega to get beverages! After my near hour wait I politely paid and mentioned that I had been waiting for 55 minutes. The chef/owner said  'Yeah that was a long wait, you're right\" No apologies, no explanation, just a yeah. To further the insult the food was terrible and was served in foil and styrofoam. This packaging caused all the sauces to mix and made the already bad spinach soggy. I would not have written this review had my previous experience been far better than my last. However, the prior visit to this was not too much better. I order medium well steak and received rare! To that my 4 friends individually had bad experiences. Therefore I will take my recommendations and business elsewhere. I do this with a heavy heart as this was a good place not too long ago.",

Now, the girls who take your order usually has an attitude and I don't know if they changed chefs, but the food is mediocre. Last time I ordered, I got all the way home with my food just to realize there was no sour cream for my tacos, in which I asked the girl for extra when I placed my order because I love sour cream and she said okay. I was so annoyed when I got home, I walked back over there just for her to tell me unapologetically that they have no sour cream. I don't understand why that couldn't have been said at the time of the order or when I picked up my food. The manager, who also used to be a friendly lady, just looked at me and kept it moving. I decided to give it another try today and called to place an order and s girl rudely answered the phone saying they wont have any food til 6:30. Never going back there, not worth it.",
