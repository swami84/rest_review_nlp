And Foodworks (along with Other Side Deli in Deering) is one of the best deli/catering shops I've known.  They don't skimp on your protein, or for that matter, anything. Your sandwiches and wraps will be packed.  They don't skimp on ingredient quality. They source as much as they can from local farms and they have their own farm too! They also do many of their meats in-house. When you have freshness, deliciousness just follows.  They don't skimp on variety. The classics are always there, but there's also always new wraps, sandwiches, soups, and salads every week.  They don't skimp on service. They'll get to know you and you'll get to know them. It's not a different cashier every day - they have a core team and you'll see those 5-6 folks there always!  The only thing they skimp on is price. Nothing is more than $10.  So there you have it. Don't go here at your own loss!",

Not to mention that the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when I pointed out that there was cheese, physically showing them so they could be aware of their mistake, while they yelled at me and denied it.
