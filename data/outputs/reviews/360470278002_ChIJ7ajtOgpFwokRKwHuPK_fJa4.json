        "caption": "At first i wasn't sure about this place. From outside looks like average, low price, outdated Japanese restaurants, nothing remarcable about it. But i was pleasantly surprised by food quality at prices they sell it for.Fish was melting in the mouth. No fishy smell at all. Rolls were well formed, not too much rice. I will order from them again. They also accept online orders at DinnerOut dot Com (tip: you'll get 15% off with coupon: DEAL15)",
