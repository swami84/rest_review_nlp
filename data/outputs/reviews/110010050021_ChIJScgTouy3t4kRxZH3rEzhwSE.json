We had broiled scallop appetizer. They were prepared to perfection. The aioli sauce was forgettable. But it didn't ruin the shell fish. I had braised lamb ravioli in aujus of lamb. Pretty heavenly. My date had broiled bronzini. We didn't share. It was a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. I would definitely return. I hope they manage to get through the pandemic. A small criticism. No salt at the table and no grated cheese for my pasta. Perhaps I'm not knowledgeable enough about fine dining.",

For dessert we had the chocolate cake, cheese cake, gelato & tiramisu. All in all a great dinner with friends.  NOW FOR PARKING!!! We spent about 20 minutes driving around trying to find a spot. Because this is mostly residential it's all street parking which is few and far between. The closest lot is down 4 blocks at 11th and K, Nations Parking. They close at 11 but it was close enough to get to an 8 o'clock dinner and get back before they closed. Of course your other choice would be uber.",

I had the imported burrata, which tasted like it was straight from Friuli. Then, the lamb ravioli was superb. I topped it off with the pistachio gelato, which was delicious. Would definitely recommend to both tourists and locals who want an authentic Italian experience!",

The place was pretty empty (5:45p Saturday) but it filled up by the time we left.  I got the braised lamb ravioli and my friends both got the seafood linguini.  Braised Lamb ravioli - I got this with the intention of being adventurous, as I'm not a lamb person. I've only recently started to be willing to eat lamb (not a fan of how gamey it usually tastes). Well, the ravioli was awesome. It didn't taste very gamey and the flavor of the sauce was rich but not heavy. I wish it could have been a little spicy but it was still delicious as is.  Seafood linguini - I've literally never seen that much seafood on a plate of seafood pasta. Half a lobster tail and that many mussels?? For less than $30?? Pleasantly unexpected. I only had two bites of it, and it was well seasoned and the pasta was perfectly al dente. My friends were really pleased with the amount of seafood they got.  One thing that could be improved is the bread that they served at the beginning - it was a bit stale, and I wish they had given us balsamic vinegar along with the olive oil.  I would definitely come back here, maybe with a bigger appetite so I could try more things on the menu.",

We recommend peeping and bill (veal). The taste of white wine and red wine was good and the staff was friendly. The inside of the restaurant is slightly darker under reddish lighting, and the atmosphere is also good. If you do not have a reservation because you have a lot of people looking for the inside, you will be weighted. After the meal, I gave the dessert menu separately, and the gelato which came out with the menu of today was delicious. Price is a little out of the way, but I want to revisit it.

The food reminded me of my time in Florence and Rome at the mom and pop shops I went in Italy. The food was a perfect portion size and it was not at all like other American Italian restaurants because the chef was not heavy  handed with the cream which was perfect. The scallops we're cooked to perfection with a hard sear and the tiramisu was to die for. Overall the flavors of the dishes we ordered sung and blended together beautifully into harmonious song.  The wait staff was very careful of me and my partners allergies and I will be back when I return to D.C. .  If you want good authenticate Italian food and spectacular service Tortino Restaurant is the place to go.",

It is a restaurant to bring good friends or out of town guests for a quiet, leisurely meal where you can catch up and not worry about the waiter trying to rush you out for the next seating.  In fact Tortino is a very \"neighborhoody\" place to the point that you know most the waiters by their first names and they know you.  Food is absolutely and always delicious.  The soup specials never disapoint. Tonight I had cauliflower soup with shrimp. My main course was the daily risotto, this time with porcini mushrooms and 4 cheeses. I also tried my sister's grilled salmon and my mother's papardelle with chicken and mushrooms. Everything is very good.  The asparagus and carrots with the salmon were cooked just right and a little crunchy. Not soggy or overcooked. For dessert, ask if they have their handmade cannolli available (not on the menu), although I like their Pana cotta with berries too.",

        "caption": "It was possibly the worst excuse for Italian food I've ever experienced! The restrooms even had blowers to dry your hands. Something you'd expect at a Denny's perhaps. The food was bad! The reviews I read were misleading and inaccurate. If you are looking for even mediocre Italian food, you won't find it at Tortino.  The waiter compared a white fish special ( likely Bassa farmed fish) to Sea Bass. That was simply a lie!  The lamb chop which was good meat, unlike the old and bad fish, wasn't marinated,  and therefore tough as leather, and tasteless as well.  The wine we ordered was great! And, reasonably priced. But as a dining experiences go this was a disaster!  If you are looking for a reasonable Italian food experience in Washington, D.C. DO NOT GO TO TORTINO!  You will be disappointed.  I am a true Foody and this was as bad an experience as I could ever imagine. I am loathed to give it even one star!",

The staff is really great. Someone misordered thinking they were getting the special, but got something else. Our waiter immediately made the substitution and didn't charge us for the extra plate.
