Wine was good but they didn\u2019t match the two meat courses (the mains) with wines. Huh? Share a glass (and by glass, I mean a drizzle of wine) over the meats? They need to revise that part. There\u2019s also another course with no wine, apparently a pallet cleanser, which was not well explained by the waiter. That\u2019s more understandable. I can get over the food being mediocre (octopus is fried in small chunks on top of a sticky sauce; the flat iron steak is served in another sticky sauce both tasting like they emerged from a bottle from the back of a fridge), but beyond that, our server wasn\u2019t helping the situation. Upon asking about splitting the wine pairing (the tiniest pour you ever did see) over the two meat courses, she said she would top it off if she saw it was needed. Well, that was her cue to do so. But she didn\u2019t, and about 3 min later, we ordered a full glass. That\u2019s just not right. Very expensive meal and lackluster all around. The lotion in the bathroom is nice though. Hah.  Quick summary: There are so many other amazing tasting menus in the area worth the big bucks where the service makes you wanna leave a generous tip. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. I\u2019m surprised Jeong has this many 5 stars.",

It's origin.  I feel like they really kept the tradition and made it more elegant visually and taste wise! Their cocktails are amazing!

We went with the tasting menu and wine pairing and everything was delicious, but was just missing that little extra something that might make it standout come next September. My standouts were the Wagyu with Kimichi truffle emulsion and the sweet potato pudding, which has a really enjoyable salty granola component. The pours were a little short, which made it challenging to get through the two mains since they shared a pairing. Will definitely be back, as it's a great addition to the neighborhood.",

They are known for their tasting menu which is six or seven little bites of food for 87 dollars. I decided to order off the \u00e0 la cart menu because I didn't want a long drawn out meal.  To start I ordered the riesling wine and my mom had the gin drink. I liked the wine but it needed to be much colder. My moms drink (see picture) was very different than the waiter described and was too spicy for her. I really liked it but it definitely was spicy so beware.  We decided to order two different plates from the \u00e0 la cart menu because they are known for their salmon tartar and scallop (individually priced at $20 and $16 which was a lot for how small the portions were).. We also ordered the Tteokbokki, Broccoli, Kalbi jjim (short rib), and one of the sashimi entrees. The salmon tartar and the scallop along with the broccoli were the highlights of this meal for me. The waiter RAVED about the Tteokbokki but never brought it to the table which was sad..  My mom loved the short rib but it is a pretty small portion for the price (~30 dollars). I didn't love the sashimi small plate and it was the smallest portion ever for $20.  All in all, I would come back for the tasting menu (which they are know for) and order the  Tteokbokki because I REALLY wanted to try it. I'd skip ordering a la carte because of the portion sizes for the price.  Service was slow but our waiter was nice enough.  For two of us bill came out to $150 excluding tip and we each only had one drink. I did leave hungry which shouldn't be the case for a $150 meal...",

First dish was tofu with crab. Amazing silky  texture that I wasn't expecting. Wow give me another one what a great opening dish. Scallop was perfectly cooked and and a delicious sauce. Salmon tartare was  beautifully presented and flavors  mixed well together Duck was perfectly cooked but the dish  was awkward for me. Duck, a side of rice and some very flavorful  but strong kimchi I just wanted more Duck. I didnt really need the sides. Wagu dish- Things got a bit off track here. My friend ate here the week before me and raved about it. I took a bite and chewed and chewed maybe 30 times and could barely break it up to swallow.  My dates beef was the same. I should have sent it back but we were having such a good time I didnt want to spoil it. We didnt finish and that should have been a sign for the staff that something was wrong  It was like a tough cheap Siirloin. So the prettiest dish is the Shrimp cake  by far. Amazing sauce and creamy quail eggs. This dish though is not for all. While the sauce is amazing the shrimp cake can be little bland. All in this is a great restuarant with some really good flavor profiles at a reasonable price point. Will definitely go back.",

And the wine pairings are incredible. You can have saki, pino grigio, Chardonnay, heavy red, and Italian dessert wines with the different courses.

But leaving it 3 stars as we ordered the recommended amount from the a la carte menu, and still spent a good amount of money, and left starving. We literally had to get sandwiches on the way home.  I was really excited to take my friend who was visiting as he had just come back from several years abroad in Korea. We wanted to love to Jeong and were disappointed.  I found a few dishes to be overly salty, but that could be me. Some dishes, while pretty, felt like nothing special. I\u2019m uncertain whether or not the chef\u2019s intention was to be authentic, but it is not authentic, for those looking for more authentic modern Korean cuisine. Perhaps the tasting menu had something else to offer that we missed out on.  Finally, there is a gluten free menu. It\u2019s a bit limited but there are options!  Overall, I\u2019m in no rush to go back.",

So we knew we had to try Jeong early before it became impossible to get in! It did not disappoint in one area. We chose the tasting menu with our two older children (12 and 17) and it was impeccable from start to finish. I don't think I could pick a favorite course! The silken tofu was like slipping into the warm comfort of home if your Mom was a five star chef. The salmon tartare was fresh, filled with contrasting textures, nuanced with flavor, and loved by everyone at the table (even one who is iffy on salmon). The scallop and duck and bavette were just perfection. I don't have any other words to describe them! Cooked to perfection and balanced with incredible flavors. And the desserts and cocktails were delicious. We had the Jujube to start which will thrill Old Fashioned lovers. Dave is doing amazing things in this kitchen. And Jen is a perfect hostess in the front of the house. Wines choices and cocktails were excellent. The space is cozy and casual, yet refined. All of the dinnerware and glassware was lovely and became an artistic part of each dish. And almost as important, Dave and Jen exude positivity and humility, are both incredibly warm and kind, and equally talented. Get in soon, before you can't!",

I didn't get to try dessert this time, but I will next time, might try the tasting menu. A la carte is the way to go if it's your first time, to get a feel of the flavors.",

You can't go wrong with either - all of the food is absolutely incredible.On the a la carte menu, you have to try the tteokbokki, the pork and kimchi dumpling, and the short rib. I also could not believe how good the chocolate cake was!!!  On my more recent visit this past weekend, I opted for the tasting menu. All I can say is WOW. I loved every single thing that was served. For me, the highlights of the tasting menu were the salmon tartare and the bavette, but each dish was so incredible it's hard to choose.  The cocktails were also out of this world tasty.  The staff is incredible knowledgeable about the menu and I love that our waitress told us how she recommended eating each of dishes. They were also kind and attentive.  I can't recommend Jeong highly enough!",

Chef Dave certainly has a way of expressing his perspective of nostalgic Korean food\u2014I especially love the dessert called \u201crice\u201d, a playful taste of bright citrus and vanilla with an awesome texture that makes me giddy, and takes me back to the candy of my own childhood too. The wine menu is terrifically thoughtful; I was really happy with the uncommon offerings at surprisingly approachable prices. Cocktails were perfectly balanced and uniquely delicious. The staff is pleasant, helpful, sincere, and charismatic. The decor is contemporary, chic, and warm with cues to Korean inspiration.  \u00c0 la carte or Tasting Menu, you can\u2019t go wrong.  The sashimi and tteokbokki are delicious and shocking at the same time, I mean whoa!, flavors that I\u2019ve never been exposed to in my life.  What stands out the most to me about Jeong, is their take on crowd pleasers like, braised short ribs (kalbi jjim) and chocolate dessert\u2014they are anything but basic. Each uniquely differentiated from any short rib or cake you\u2019ve ever had. (I have lost sleep thinking about the kalbi jiim, it seriously haunts me.)  Above all, the atmosphere made me feel calm and the food made me really happy.  So excited about what this crew is up to and what they bring to the Chicago food scene!",
