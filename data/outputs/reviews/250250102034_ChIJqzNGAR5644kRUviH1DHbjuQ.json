I had the spicy garlic noodles sub pineapple for jalape\u00f1os. The noodles were cooked perfectly however there was ZERO SPICE ZERO GARLIC FLAVOUR. I even had to ask for salt. Additionally some of my food was not heated all the way through, namely my chicken. Then there's the vegetables, specifically the broccoli and bell peppers. The broccoli texture felt like it had been par boiled then cooked and reheated like 5 times and was super soft. Also there were no large florets. The bell pepper still tasted raw and just barely warmed. I would've appreciated crunchier broccoli and cooked but crunchy bell peppers. Lastly the portion is small if you're a decent eater you'll be hungry again. Although, the person I was with made their own bowl and it was double mine so maybe that's the play? In any case, I wouldn't dissuade anyone from going but don't know if I'd return without a reason.",

Having not been through the screens it took a while. I am glad nobody was waiting behind us.  I assume they have an app where you can just re-order the bowl combination you like and go right to pickup.  The kiosk has a card scanner where you pay and get a very itemized receipt with all the items selected for each custom bowl.  In the custom menu you get to pick a set quantity of items in each category.  There is some base quantity of items you can get in each category.  You seam to know when you have hit the quantity of toppings when things you have not selected have an add-on price added.  Maybe there was a counter i did not see.  Vegan was a successful custom bowl build in our set.  Two bowls with rice noodles and one with whole wheat.  Everyone felt the pasta was a little under cooked as it felt a little firm.  Ingredients were fresh and had good flavor.  We ordered two bowls with the sauce on the side... their multi-spice topping.  In the end we found the sauces to our taste and if we ever visit one again we would just have them mix it in.  We would eat here again.",

You walk over to the kiosk and select what you want. If you're making your own stir fry bowl, you get to pick a protein (price varies per protein), a base, a sauce, three veggies, and two garnishes within the price of the bowl. You pay at the kiosk, get your order number and wait for them to call it out - usually 5-10 min. I think if you do takeout, it shows up on the cool billboard. The food is tasty and the sauces are delicious. My bowl usually is a veggie one with an egg (extra), we white noodles, mushrooms, bell peppers, edamame, roasted cashews and pickled cucumbers with the sesame garlic sauce. They also do seasonal bowls, which is a nice change if you want to try something new. Someone also stopped by during our lunch to see if everything was alright, and that's just great customer service unexpected at a fast, casual restaurant.  Cons: 1. Since you select everything at the kiosk, you can't adjust the quantity. Say you want onions but just a little. Or you like mushrooms, so you would want more of it. 2. They're a little skimpy with the garnishes. I want more pickled cucumbers! 3. No steel forks even if you dine in. 4. I did enter my phone number but I'm not sure if I got any rewards for my order? 5. There's street parking but it can be tough on the weekends. 6. My biggest peeve was that the stir fry was cold for my liking, even though I ate in.  Overall, the flavors are good, and that deserves 4 stars!",

I had to sriracha and hosin the hell out of my bowl to get any kind of flavor to the Red Curry bowl. The ingredients are fresh, but the stir fry is so greasy it might as well be from any other Asian restaurant in Boston.  Find you a little Mom and Pop shop somewhere in town and save your coins for something better. Don't bother with their juices, either. Odd flavors and packed full of sugar. This place in general is one you can feel good about skipping over.  Service was 10/10. Efficient, nice, mindful. That's the only redeeming thing, though.",
