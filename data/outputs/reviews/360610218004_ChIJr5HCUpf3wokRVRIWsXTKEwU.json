Absolutely LOVED the Udon, just a lovely bowl of flavor and the noodles were perfectly chewy but cooked. Just a well executed representation of a classic dish. And I just have to mention the Baby Back Ribs. My wife flipped out they were so good. Perfectly tender and tangy from that rockin' sauce. Just a burst of flavor. I could go on but you get the point. Ok I lied, the Hanger Steak was fantastic as well. Served perfectly cooked and I don't think I have better rice than that coconut rice. Ok that's it. I look forward to returning and introducing my friends and family to this lovely new establishment on FD BLVD in the very near future!",

They were brillant to set a lounge with the decorative cool vibe that reminded me of old jazz scenes back in the day in Harlem.  The colors of the walls, seats, tables and dimmed lights all celebrated the vibe of a laid back comfy space.  The drinks were fantastic of course, enough to keep them coming as you enjoyed the scenery.   The food had a flare of of taste from around the globe that blowed my mind wanting to sample everything on the menu.  With that said, I will most certainly be a returning customer.  Truly enjoyed the Short Ribs Fried Wontons - your mouth will melt with the spices and the Undon Noddles were a hit too.",

Not only is it a great bar with awesome cocktails and a large assortment of spirits, but the music is always fantastic and the ambiance is very nice and chic.  However, the best aspects of Bixi are the amazing food and staff!  My favorite food items are the ribs, short rib wontons, and pork belly bahn mi sandwich.  Everything is very flavorful and unique!  For drinks, I recommend the tin tiger for sure!   The atmosphere is fun and the crowd here is always lively.  They even have a backyard with a fire pit that gives off a lot of warmth even during cold winter nights. I recommend this spot to anyone in Harlen...you won't find anything like it!  It's a true gem!! :)",
