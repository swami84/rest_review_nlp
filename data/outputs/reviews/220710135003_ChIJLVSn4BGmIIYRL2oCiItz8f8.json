Yesterday was my first visit since the ownership change.  My girlfriend and I went craving their burger. In short this establishment is not yo mamas.  The restaurant is void of the personality it once was.  It has no personality.  The staff seems to awkwardly recognize it as well.  Althoigh we came because we were craving the cheddar burger, we  almost didn't order.  But the bartender told us the cooks were still the same.  By the way, the place is now called port of St. Peter's or St. Peter's Port.  We ordered 2 cheddar burgers and baked potatoes.  We were told there were no baked potatoes ready.  That stuff happens but it never happened at yo mamas.  We subbed the Mac n cheese.  The burger was disappointing.  It was laden with garlic and other unknown spices that overpowered the taste of the beef.  The patty was dense. The bun was fresh but sweet.  Overall the burger is average at best.  For those that knew yo mamas, they had an awesome burger.  One of the best in Nola.... The Mac n cheese was unremarkable.  Overall our experience was marked negatively in part by the claims of the staff that the food was the same as yo mamas.  It is clearly not.  And that claim will hurt them with anyone who ate at yo mamas.  Like some of the other locals posted here, we will not go back.  The new restaurant may be trying to cater to the more transient crowd.  And I wish them well.",

Tucked away on a side street just a block off of Bourbon Street, Yo Mamma's brings one thing to the city of New Orleans that every downtown area needs. A quality late night eating spot. They are open late and serve what I would call the city's best burger. Their burgers are big, juicy, and made from quality meet. And they don't short you on the availability of topings either. From your classics like cheese and mushrooms, too some more unconventional topics like bacon and peanut butter (I know but strangely it works), they have something for every partially happy, hungry, partially intoxiacted person wondering the french quarter. Also they don't serve fries, so you get your choice of side salad or loaded baked potato. Also try the Gumbo, but be warned the gumbo goes fast so they may not have any left by the time you get there.",
