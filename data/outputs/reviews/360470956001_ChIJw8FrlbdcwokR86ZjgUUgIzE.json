After tasting that smoothie I couldn't wait to see what's my food would taste like, and The smell of fresh curry filling the restaurant made me anticipate my food even more. Once I got my food my I was beyond satisfied. The workers made sure I had everything down to salt and pepper in my bag like they really took care of me like I was one of their friends and not just another dollar sign like some of those other restaurants on that flatlands strip, And once I got to eat my food every taste bud on my tongue was jumping in excitement. We need more restaurants like this in the neighborhood. An establishment that appreciates the customers that supports them. They make it clear US THE CUSTOMERS is the reason they are open and they appreciate every bit of it. They earned that five star rating and I expect them to grow into a full blown dine in restaurant in the future In the city showing them other restaurants how customer service is done.
