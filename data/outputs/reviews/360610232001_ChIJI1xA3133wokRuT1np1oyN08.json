And it turned out to be a great decision on my part. *****  I gave up on the fried fish in Harlem, which is a culture classic on Fridays in our community. The last 7 years or so most of the fish spots I've visited serve weak, flat, tasteless fried (whiting) fish pieces - but not this place.  First, the presentation was excellent when my food came out. Although, I requested a \"too go\" plate - it was packed nicely with some surprise veggies (sliced onions, green peppers & squared tomatoes) placed inside. Go chef! Thanks for that true homemade vibe.  The quality of the fish was absolutely delicious! Two semi-chunky catch of whiting came out crunchy, seasoned just right, and flaky,. I was very pleased with all of it, including the french fries. I recommend this place and will surely be back to get that fish sandwich platter again. I'll definitely be back to try other seafood on the menu because of this experience.  Also, I met the owner and server briefly, both were very accommodating, generous and kind. I felt welcomed and appreciated & left with my belly full. Great service - great food. = A++",

Well I took him up on that and we went there for the night with a few heads. Had a really good time. The cinnamon toast crunch hookah was hittin. There wasnt a real bar there per s\u00e8, but I'm not a big drinker anyway so the Henny punch was good enough for me. When I went they didnt have any food there, I hear they do now. That was the only thing missin for me that night. Music was good. Just the right amount of ppl came by for a very comfortable experience. Security did a great job of keeping everything real chill. I enjoyed my time there. Would certainly go again to see what the food is hittin for. I recommend it if ur in Harlem and want a nice lil lounge spot for a good night out.",
