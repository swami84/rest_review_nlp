I called on 3 different occasions where I couldnt even place an order because either A. The food ran out or B. The delivery man has left for the day. When you ask what time does delivery stop as a heads up, you get a reply of \"I dont know, depends on when he leaves.\" What? Lol and its hilarious because shes right. One time I've called at 3ish, another time at about 4:15, and another at 5 PM and the delivery guy... had.. left.  The last time I was actually ABLE to place an order, it got sent back because the person taking my order forgot to ask or write down my number -sighs-..  All in all ... get it together. Please. Would really like to see that same excitement people got ordering from your restaurant when you first opened, back.",

Along with It taking over an 1 1/2 for delivery, when it came my food (fried fish, yams and collard greens), was all smashed together. Even though I'd requested fish fried crispy it was, upside down in a pool of grease and liquid which made it wet & soggy. We ordered to eat with my aunt who had been eating hospital/nursing home food for 2 months, but nothing had any flavor and was so bad, even she couldn't eat it and her ribs were big hunks of fat. We threw it all in the garbage. I ordered half iced tea and half lemonade, which the lady that took the order, assured me they make the tea & lemonade. She lied, it was Snapple poured into a plastic container. I HATE Snapple.The delivery man said that if we ever come to the restaurant, they could make up for the long delivery by \"giving you a piece of cornbread, that's all they can do\". That's not all they can do, they can stop with the phoney reviews, learn to cook and wrap food properly for delivery or go out of buisness.",

I ordered about 7 different things only to be told they're out of about 70% of their menu. Got Fried Chicken, with Mac and Cheese, candied yams and and a small side of corn. I asked the attendant specifically how many pieces of chicken are in the small, medium and large she says 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Since I was ordering for me and my family, I asked for a large order and aa medium order to make seven pieces of chicken. Got it home and was ready to dive into some soul food. Well, that was disappointing to say the least. I get home and got only 4 pieces of chicken. 2 in each order. So basically the larger size was just a bigger helping of the sides. Which pretty much shorts the family meal a few pieces of chicken. Moving on. I figured the Mac and Cheese would make up for the lack of chicken, I was wrong. Apparently the cook or the staff or both are heavy smokers, and the Mac and Cheese tray is where they ash. It sure tasted like that and I saw absolutely no burn marks on it so it leaves little room for any other excuse. The candied yams also had a tinge of smoke, but not as pronounced. Probably due to the spices in it. They both looked delicious though, very deceptive. That leaves the corn. That was good also, but it was pretty much loose corn either frozen or canned, and warmed up, no big deal their either.  So in short, staff is either deceitful or unknowledgeable. Food is probably great if you're a 2 pack a day smoker. Call ahead and ask what's on the menu cause there's a better than great chance they won't have it. Meal cost me $22 dollars. Consider that money well spent to know where not to go. Had to throw out most of the food and order up something different. Too bad, I was hoping this would be the place to go more often.",
