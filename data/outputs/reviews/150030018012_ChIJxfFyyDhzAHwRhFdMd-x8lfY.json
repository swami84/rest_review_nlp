Ordered a small cheese pizza which tasted a lot like cardboard and a calzone with bacon, pepperoni and garlic. Only thing in it was garlic. Very little of the other ingredients way more dough than usual.  So disappointed.  Only giving 4 stars based upon previous experience.  If I was rating based upon just tonight I\u2019d give a 2.",

Everything is made to order and worth the wait! Yes, I'm one of those freaks that likes pineapple on a pizza so we ordered the Volcano but only with half lol my sister doesn't like it. Oh man that pizza is so good and fresh, nice amount of marinara sauce and toppings. We tried their disco fries, basically fries with gravy and and cheese over them very good.  We also got a Stromboli, the dough was perfectly cooked and delicious! I'm not a fan of marinara sauce on the side I usually pass it over to my sister cause she loves extra sauce but not this time lol, I actually ate it all. With all the food we ordered we had enough leftovers for breakfast the next day lol, this is definitely worth checking out.",
