The pizza box got ruined by rain water as a result while carrying it from his car, up the stairs, back to the house. Never has the customer had to do the most difficult part of the delivery, which is carrying it inside from the street. Though the pizza was good, I will never order from Pizza Bolies again and I would not recommend anyone ask for delivery from this location or use it.",

The online tracker says they received the order and are working on it but has not updated since I made the order! I wanted to give them a chance since i ordered from them before and the food was great but after this, it\u2019s not looking good. Just got off the phone with them after 5 minutes of the woman just trying to find the order (initially she couldn\u2019t and tried to tell us we were calling the wrong location.) and the lady says their online machine wasn\u2019t working so they didn\u2019t see our order and now all of a sudden it\u2019s working and will be another 35 minutes until we receive it, so unacceptable! If i didn\u2019t call would i just not have received anything? I know where I won\u2019t be ordering from in the future.",

Then calls right back to say he wasn't gonna get out of his car until I was at the door, cool. I get to the door call him, he said \"Im not coming to the door until I can see you.\" He sees that I'm A BLACK FEMALE AND TELLS ME HE CAN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR ALL OF A SUDDEN! Even said \"Maam I see you but because of the location I cannot get out of the car.\"  I live in a nice neighborhood so there was no excuse for this! He expected me to walk out to his car and do his job in 28\u00b0 weather in my pajamas at 1 a.m.! That will be my last time ordering from Pizza Boli. Thank your lazy, RACIST delivery driver who chose not to serve a black woman who was spending $30!! I was actually gonna tip him $10 for working in the cold.  My money is green like everyone elses. Several others in the neighborhood have had the same experience. I will make sure I tell as many ppl as possible about the way this establishment treats their minority customers. They dont exist without our money. I will be contacting the BBB as well.",

I tried the cheesbugrger sub for the first time and it was absolutely dreadful. The beef patties tasted like rancid cardboard and were the lowest quality burgers in existence. This was by far the worst sub I've ever ordered period that was definitely not worth the price. I read a bad review on it previously and decided to give it a fair chance, this was a big mistake. Their cuts of frozen beef patties are riddled with gummy-like glycerin filler that has a horrible taste, grey color and texture with little to no genuine beef. You're better off making a dog food sub. None the less, the cheesesteak I previously had was good for the price and a far cry from this tragedy. Take my advice and never order the cheeseburger sub, your wallet and digestive system will regret it severely.",
