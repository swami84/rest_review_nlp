Both the woman and the man there did not care about customers. How can the owner Cheryl Smith allow such people to run her restaurant. She should be made aware of how her customers are treated. I ordered brunch and received my coffee and drink all together. When I tried my coffee it was cold and I told the waitress my coffee is cold can I get another one and she said \u201cyou will have to pay\u201d I said ok never mind. We were done eating and I could live without coffee for a day. What really bothered me was her sarcastic comment which was so unecessary. \u201cThe nature of coffee is for it to get cold\u201d I let it go but it really bothered me because it is not how you should treat customers. She could have asked would you like me to warm it for you. That would have been nice. When I asked to speak with the manager she said \u201c I am the manager\u201d I was in shock. I didn\u2019t want to speak with her because she was rude. I spoke to the man who was seating everyone and he seemed like he didn\u2019t care as well and said our policy is that We don\u2019t give refill on coffee . I get that. The point is the way I was spoken to is unacceptable. The waitress chimed in and said \u201cshe wants free coffee\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t come back here\u201d  to me infront of my kids. My seven year old was scared and said she was a mean and rude lady and told me let\u2019s get out of here. My college daughter was upset that our family brunch was ruined by this waitress. It was embarrassing to me the ways she spoke to me infront of all the customers and my family. I was treated with no respect as a customer. I will never go back to this place no matter how good the food maybe it sure ruined everything. First of all it\u2019s small, there is a long wait to be seated, service is terrible. Like someone else said there are other places in the neighborhood who deserves my money . Not some place that doesn\u2019t care about their customers. Not worth my time and energy.",

We were told to call in advance so that we would have our food before we drove back to our school which is about two hours away. My friend and I called at 11:30 with our order and were told to pick it up at 12. At 12:00 we went to pick up our order and they had messed it up completely. We had to wait ANOTHER HOUR before we got our food to go and by this time we were late to our bus, causing ALL 40 KIDS ON IT TO BE LATE TO SCHOOL\u2019S END AND THEIR AFTER SCHOOL OBLIGATIONS. We were very vocal about needed to leave ASAP but everyone who came after us proceeded to get their orders BEFORE we got our corrected one. One of the most frustrating experiences I\u2019ve had in NYC and will definitely NEVER go back again. Obviously needs more staffing because it was a mess in there with two people trying to take and serve all the to go and I\u2019m house orders while the guy working kept on whispering the f word every 5 minutes about how many people were there. Props to the blue haired girl though, thank you for being very apologetic and kind to my friend and I during our time of extreme frustration.",

Their homemade Chantilly cream is very flavorful. Unfortunately, the service was very sub-par.  It took the hostess 10 min to greet us and then sit us at a table (there were open tables). Then it took another 10 min to be greeted by a server. Then after the meal was completed it took over 15 min to get the check back from the server. All around the service was very slow and they weren't that busy which was very frustrating. However, I'm willing to give them another try for that french toast. :)",

Not a word of apology from staff about delay. However, they remembered to include mandatory 18% tip for this level of service. Was it worth it? No. Would not recommend. Skip and go some place else",

He gave me that \u201cI\u2019ll give poor service to the younger person because they aren\u2019t going to tip\u201d vibe while waiting on me. I usually tip pretty well, and I still did.  He also scratched his balls after he put in another order for someone else. Also, I was a bit put off by his short shorts that looked like work out shorts. All I could think of is who is this sweaty grown a** man waiting on me. He wasn\u2019t sweaty, but that\u2019s all I could think about. I\u2019ve always wondered why businesses have dress codes restricting workout clothes, but today I got it! And like I said, I\u2019m young!  Suggestion for the kitchen: When a customer orders a sandwich to go, do not put it in a spacey box. By the time the customer gets home, it will be a tossed salad!!  Compliments to the owner: Yass auntie!! You are doing super well!! I love to see black people thrive! The food was just as good as Toms. Overall decor and customer base made me feel comfortable. You supersede Toms by 1,000pts.  You also have many savvy  customers! Thank you for a food experience!",

With all that being said, the food was actually delicious and well worth the price. But the service was just terrible. Wish i had read more into the reviews as it seems to be a common theme. I think service is as important as food, i want to feel welcomed and have a good time at a place im spending my money. If you come here I'll tell you the pancakes the porridge and the french toast are good. But make sure you track the waiters and waitresses because you will spend time waiting for no reason.",

Today I walked into the restaurant with my partner at around 4:40 and sat down because I didn\u2019t see a hostess . After sitting a waiter gave us a drink menu and said the food wouldn\u2019t be served until 5:00 so we ordered drinks and waited . At 5:00 the restaurant began to fill up and about 5 more parties came in after us . All of those parties received dinner menus before us , were able to place orders before us and received their dinner before my partner and I as well . My partner and I felt unfairly treated at a restaurant that we always loved to frequent in the past. Our waitress did not come back to check on us after we recieve our food and the food was subpar. The food lacked its original seasoning and my partner received a smaller sized portion of meat than I did , which left him feeling unsatisfied with his meal . To make matters worse the automatically included gratuity can be a bit pricy and increase your bill a substantial amount . The service and the food was subpar and I probably won\u2019t return again.  First Review:  This restaurant is small and very quite. My lunch companion pointed out to me that the restaurant has a very unique but refreshing  decor. The hostess greeted us immediately and we were seated in like five minutes. The food was affordable and very delicious . During my first visit I had breakfast like eggs ,toast, bacon and orange juice. Last night I had the grilled jerk wings with scotch bonnet pepper sauce on the side, grilled salmon with mash potatoes and string beans , and fried catfish , macaroni and cheese and spinach . The food was filling , and I felt very light afterwards. My date and I were super satisfied with our meals. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a delicious meal, and likes comfy cozy restaurants.",

Service was swell, but the food made me realize the chef was out, as was Cheryl. And then also, with a party of just 2, they automatically added 20%. This is new. AND, the check still had the full section with 15, 18, 20, 22% amounts and space to add the tip. Without saying anywhere that gratuity was included. You only knew because the bill was too high and for an inconspicuous extra line item in the total. Odd. I left it, but it made we want to reduce to 15%. Not to mention the charge was already thru. Cheryl - not good, was a big turn off. We live around the corner and you know who we are and like us, and we are so glad you are here. Hope you see this. Just some feedback.",

Very impersonal waitress who ignored us for 10 minutes, then rushed us through our order, snatching away our menus as soon as our order was out of our mouths. All brunch specials come with a \"first cup of coffee or tea and a Bloody Mary or Mimosa.\" However, they won't let someone swap the Bloody Mary/Mimosa for a second cup of coffee, which is illogical to me, you have to choose a juice instead if you don't want alcohol. The regular hash and lox hash weren't very good, mushy potatoes with no crisp whatsoever. Pancakes were two smallish 4 inch pancakes that were $7 and not worth the price. I got the crimini omelet, which was browned like crazy on the outside like the eggs were overdone. Why do I even try brunch places anymore?",

I had a ginger tea since all desserts are dairy based which was very strong and good. Would come back for that tea. If you are a meat eater this may be a good place for you. If you are a vegan probably not so much at least food wise. Atmosphere is great. There was live music while we were there. It was good but made it hard to talk.",

We drove past the place initially because its not that noticeable on the dark street. Almost decided to go elsewhere,  but convinced ourselves to look. That was a great decision. A care pulled out of a parking spot right in front and we knew it was karma to cone here. The place is a simple nice layout and we felt immediately comfortable upon entering. We were freeted by Alexa who was also our server, and thats all she wrote! Alexa said the rum pumch was good, and we ordered 2 of them. They were fairly potent! I enjoyed that.  We ordered the chili plum wings, and the calamari to start. The wings were ok and the calamari was really good, even without the dipping chili plum, which is delicious! I decided to have the blackened catfish, which came with sauteed spinach, and mac and cheese. This was so good! The mac and cheese was amazing, and so was the spinach and the catfish. They give nice portions for you to really enjoy. My friend ordered the striped bass escovitch style, also quite delicious. We got a taste of the string beans whoch were crunchy with a flavorful sauce to it. Will order a larger size next time. Listen, this place is a little neighborhood gem thats merits multiple visits!",

The frittata contained potatoes, cheese, tomatoes, greens, and sausage. I also ordered a side of pancakes (they were amazing), and a cup of tea.

It was my second time there, but my boyfriend's first, and he was impressed just as much.  Not only did the server constantly ensured that we were satisfied with our food and drinks, the owner/Chef Cheryl also happened to be there last evening, just jamming with a live band that was playing chill music (and singing with them).  It was also quite apparent how well she treats the people who work for her in the way she spoke with them to leaving the server a tip for serving her and her friends with whom she was sharing a table that evening.  It seems like a very down to earth place.  We spoke with the Chef afterward and it was great to speak with her and to witness her humility.  It was very refreshing to meet her, and the service and excellent food/drinks we had last evening is a reflection of what I imagine is her excellent leadership at the restaurant.",

If you don't mind sitting close to others and possibly hearing their convo, you will be fine! Just focus on who you are with! Haha!The wait time can be about 5-10mins depending on how large the party is. I was only with 1other person so it was less than 5 mintues. You get your food quickly after ordering. I would have given my meal 3 stars if I was rating the food (it could be because of what I ordered). The aesthic of the place is intimate and sweet with low lighting.

I'm not sure why and I found it quite by a short brown haired hostess which I found odd. I provided the id but decided to wait to see who else was asked for id. I waited until 3 or 4 patrons (all white ) paid their bill. None of them were asked for id.As a Black person this is the last restaurant I would think would treat me unfairly. But buyer beware. The food was ok, the service uninspired at best. But this uneven application of id policy merits no stars if it was possible.",
