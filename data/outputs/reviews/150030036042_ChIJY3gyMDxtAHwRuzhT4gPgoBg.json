For me, pho falls into the category of \u201ccomfort food.\u201d It\u2019s simply good food, good price, good service. You have wooden chopsticks (which I prefer), stacks of condiments on the table with napkins, spoons, and small dishes. This place fit that category so perfectly, all it needed was extreme limited seating... DONE!  This next part may sound like I\u2019m dissing the place, but hear me out. The food was Good... not GREAT!!! But that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Her summer roll was actually the perfect size for a dip of peanut sauce... not too big (& it\u2019s true that bigger is NOT always better \ud83d\ude02) and not too small. The soup was hot and satisfying and her compliment of basil, peppers, and bean sprouts was the right balance to the soup. The right food for a rainy day.  Some people may say I\u2019m trying too hard to make this place sound good. For me it comes down to this... I walked in with set expectations that were met. Should I expect any more?",

It is tough and chewy and taste way over cooked.  How do you call this a \u201crare\u201d beef pho when nothing is rare about it.  The reason this review gets 1 star is because they use CHICKEN STOCK.  It taste like something you would get out of a can.  It\u2019s supposed to be a beef noodle soup common guys get it right.  The chicken completely distracts from the flavor of the beef.  It\u2019s too confusing for my taste buds.  If I paid $6-$8 for this I would be satisfied.  There are plenty of other pho restaurants in the area that charge the same amount or less and make fresh Beef Stock, give you fresh raw meat, jalape\u00f1os, lime, chili oil, etc.  If you want to charge the same price as the competition you have to bring it up to their standard at a minimum.  I will never be returning here.  I am so disappointed and feel like I just got duped out of $15",

        "caption": "Saw this place while walking down the street and noticed their sign for anything $10.99.  At that price, I had to try it.  For the very reasonable price, I must say, I got a really generous bowl of Pho that was tasty and loaded.  The place is clean, well lighted, and the service was friendly as well as fast.  Going to have to hit this place up again for sure.  Can't go wrong with the price and what you got for it was great especially if you are on a budget and hungry.  The menu does focus pretty much on Pho, but there are some other options.  Nothing exotic or particularly unique, but you will find something you want to eat on the menu to match your mood.  There were a few odd menu items that seemed a bit non Vietnamese, but they are probably just trying to offer a variety.  I plan to check them out again.",

Portions are good, maybe could have used a bit more meat in the combination pho I ordered. The flavor of the broth was tasty and the meat was tender. Really enjoyed the spring rolls! My wife enjoyed the BBQ chicken with Vermicelli bowl, (heads up there are mint leaves shredded up in the bottom for those that don't care for mint.) Price was $10.99 ( opening pricing) for entrees and $8.99 for spring rolls, which is not bad for portioning and quality of food and presentation. Overall my wife and I enjoyed a nice quiet dinner with great service and quality food, definitely recommend it!",

My review is unbiased and honest.  I ordered a rice vermicelli with bbq chicken and pork. Very tasty and well seasoned. It also comes with bean sprout and herbs underneath. The sweet fish sauce brings in more flavor.  I also ordered 2 tofu rolls for my grandma. She is a vegetarian. She said it was ok not as good.  Friendly owner. Right now they have special price $10.99 on most items. I don't know when he prices going to chabge but definitely worth a try. Hopefully they stay consistent with the quality!",
