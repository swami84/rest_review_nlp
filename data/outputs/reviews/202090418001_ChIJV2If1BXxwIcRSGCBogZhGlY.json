I asked if you delivered downtown because if the food was good, I would be spreading the news.  I Work on  E. 9th street, the Gentleman said yes, and gave me a menu.  I suggested your restaurant for lunch and you guys didn't disappoint.  I order the comeback and wings and my peers loved everything they order and will be coming back for more.  It's hard to find reasonable priced food made with care, working in the down town area.  Your delivery orders are about increase in the downtown area, so you may want to start charging  some type of delivery fee ..like standard $3 or depending on locations(I love that you don't but understand if you do)  oh and the carrot cake was awesome.  Royal touch is a refreshing take on lunch and your Representatives represent the restaurant well.",
