Not only is the setting wonderful being in the super cute downtown Alpharetta, but the food was phenomenal!  I had the gluten free fried chicken!!  So good!  We also had the duck fries - did not know that duck grease is healthier than others.  Didn't believe them either - but looked it up on Google and it's true!  And it makes the fries extra crispy - to die for!  Great chocolate GF cake for dessert too...not sure but it really tasted like Alpine Bakery :)  We will definitely be back!",

We dined around 3 o\u2019clock during the bar bites menu time (in between) lunch and dinner service. We all shared the Pimento Fritters, Paquillu Peppers stuffed with Beef Short Rib, Garam Masala Cauliflower, Crab Kabocha Toast, and a slice of chocolate cake sourced from the local Alpine Bakery. Our servers name was Brandon, and he did an exceptional job explaining/describing each dish before we ordered. I would rate the Service a 10, Food a 10, Restaurant Cleanliness/Ambiance a 10, and Menu Variety gets a 10 as well. I\u2019ve lived in this area for over three years, and I also work in the hospitality business. This place is perfect. Please don\u2019t change a thing!",

Their Fleur de lis cocktail was also out of this world for anyone who appreciates a botanically based gin cocktail. Service was amazing. They were busy but were able to seat us right away.  Their menu wasn't marked with what was allergen friendly and what wasn't, but their servers were very well versed in what the menu had and what was safe for me to order.  10/10 would visit again.",

At Citizen Soul you get the full package: knowledgeable professional wait staff who actually know the menu and the way dishes are made AND entr\u00e9es that are original and freshly made of quality ingredients.  I really enjoyed the scallops.  You only get 3 but it is plenty unless you are starving.  I also recommend the brussels sprouts as a side dish; they are delightfully sauteed with pork belly and sweet onions but they are not oily at all.  The flatbreads are made from scratch, it is a traditional crust, and it is very nicely topped with quality ingredients.  The flatbread on the kids menu is an unbeatable value that would almost satisfy an adult appetite... It is actually the same size as the regular flatbreads but with cheese only.",

Reservation made on google, efficiently processed. Arrive 10 mins early and seated immediately, restaurant had a good vibe. 3 people seated and ordered 2 starters to share and 3 mains. No offer of wine, glasses were just removed from table. Complimentary water served. Drinks order brought the table all separately, soft drinks left on table no glasses, had to ask for them. Starters arrived but only 1, again we had to call server back and surprised she said she didn\u2019t put order in!!! Again had to ask for plates for sharing starters. So 1 starter was finished before salad arrived. What\u2019s the point, the salad while good was lacking on the subtle veggie/bacon ingredients. 3 mains arrived again separately, dining is about everyone getting their meal at the same time and it wasn\u2019t that there were not enough people or bussers around to help deliver food. We were offered the desert menu said yes but server brought the bill!! Again we asked for the menu. At this stage we decided to pass and order ice cream in another establishment. While reviewing Citizens menu and finishing our drinks we completed the bill and chatted. The server was eager to get the bill off the table and by now we said a strong NO to be left to finish our drinks. Never have I had a service that was so inconsistent, she was just not clued in and did not give the impression that she was new in anyway. Overall, not excited to come back, food good, service poor, value for money below average in comparison to other eateries in Main Street and Avalon. Disappointed all round. Lacking Soul.",

This location brings out the promise of the development in Alpharetta city center. The lobster salad was fantastic.  What could have been an excellent experience was destroyed by abysmal service. Our server was slow to take our order, gracially slow to bring our check, didn't handle the split checks the way we requested, and then abandoned our table completely. At the end we had to scrounge up cash to leave at the table so we could get out of there, and that was after what turned into an over 90 minute lunch.  Won't be returning.",

        "caption": "Today we went back to Citizen Soul in downtown Alpharetta during lunchtime, after two excellent dining experiences. As we always do, we took our own wine and understand the cork fee arrangement, but to our surprise the hostess informed us that we could not open our wine because it was available on the restaurant's wine list (Cross Barn by Paul Hobbs ). I promptly requested that they check if they had exactly the same harvest (2012), as I would be willing to pay for the wine and return with mine to my home if indeed they had the same wine we brought. Later it was confirmed by the waiter that they did not have this harvest and yet they did not allow us to open our wine. Without hesitation, we decided to get up and leave. I really hope that this episode will serve the manager / owner review the policy of the restaurant, because any layman knows that wines of the same label but different vintages are not equivalent. As a client, this experience may lead me to never return to this establishment. While we understand the rule (I.e.; only allow customers to bring in wines that are not on the restaurant\u2019s wine list), and believe it is fair, they could have worked with us. The manager didn\u2019t even come to the table to talk to us, she kept sending the waiter, who was understandably, a bit embarrassed. Some flexibility and common sense would\u2019ve gone a long way.

I've enjoyed the charcuterie board, pimento cheese fritters, and the burger. The bartenders and servers are friendly and makes you feel welcomed. Their fire pit outside is the perfect way to end the evening.  Original review from December 2018: Really enjoyed this restaurant! Had reservations for dinner mid-week. There was a nice crowd and the restaurant was almost completely full and we were seated on time. The atmosphere and ambiance is warm and inviting. Service was great...friendly, attentive and, knowledgeable.  Nice small menu with unique options...not the normal everyday plates you see at most restaurants. The squash toast and salmon were amazing. I loved the peanut butter chocolates for dessert.  Will definitely be coming back. So glad to have this awesome restaurant added to our community.",

Our server seemed to forget about us at times. All the tables around us received their drinks and apps before we did, even those tables who were both seated and ordered after we did.  Additionally we ordered the special (tomahawk steak) and were not warned of the $100 price tag. I appreciate that special dishes are offered but the staff should be mindful of a menu item costing 4x as much as all the other main dishes and give the customer a heads up so the bill isn\u2019t a surprise. We were also told all the sides were \u201ca la carte,\u201d a nice way of saying your $100 steak comes with no sides.  The sommelier was friendly and introduced himself right away. Unfortunately our server hadn\u2019t stopped by yet and we hadn\u2019t ordered any food. It would be better if the sommelier stopped by after food had been ordered and could offer pairings. Or if the server had asked \u201care any of you interested in speaking without sommelier about wine pairings for you meal?\u201d Instead of helping with wine selections, the sommelier seemed to spend most of his time running food and refilling water for the tables.",
