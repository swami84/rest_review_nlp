        "caption": "I love this Chinese restaurant! Everything is always coked and prepared to perfection. I have never attended the dining area, but it is very clean and nice from what I can see. Obviously, right now, there is no dining inside and so I am picking up when I need to go to Walgreens or Cermak Fresh Market. The ladies are always so sweet and lovely who wait on me. The prices are always very reasonable and you get plenty of great quality food. This is the highlight in this plaza , located at 3000 S. Halsted. They also serve some fun different combinations of smoothies like Cucumber-Avocado. I try something different each time I go, and nothing fails to be wonderful! I highly recommend this for Chicago residents as well as though traveling from out of state to visit our great city!",

        "caption": "Friend and I frequent this place almost every weekend. While he usually orders orange chicken, I've tried several other items on the menu. They updated and refreshed the dining finer decor recently which adds a more pleasant look and feel to the experience (instead of a cheap take out feel). Food I think is above average quality and service can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are. Usually just one guy servicing the dining area and he's nice and generally responsive.  Seems to be a discrepancy between take out and dine in. I think this may be due to the food not remaining as fresh in take out boxes?  Their orange chicken is tasty with a mild kick. Sauce is just right, not drowned out like some places. Food is cooked with sauce versus poured on afterwards. Sizable chicken pieces and with very good chicken fried rice (since last time it has improved and is now as good if not better than Three Happiness on 34th and Halsted). Meal combos usually come with 2 pieces of crab rangoon (you can substitute for an egg roll like my friend does).  Their pad thai seems to have evolved into something else though. The first time I had it, it was with beef and the sauce had a odd sweet tangy flavor which I found mildly offputting. Beef was tender and juicy and came with the usual crushed peanuts. Second time it came out as pad ewe (thick, wide rice noodles) which is nothing like pad thai that I'm used to. Makes me think I was misheard but when I asked, the waiter confirmed it was pad thai. Guess no one liked the first iteration?  I'll update with experience of other dishes later.",
