When friends come into town, it\u2019s the first place we think of when dining out for dinner. There are many good choices in downtown Boise and have always considered you as one of them...until last night. I\u2019m not sure if there is new management or maybe a new cook, but when all three of our meals are not close to being the standard of what we have come to expect from Flatbread, then something is wrong. I had the Rosemary Chicken sandwich which is normally an extremely tasty sandwich that I always order. Last night it was very dry and unpleasantly tasteless. I did eat half of it because I was hungry. My sister-in-law had the Alfredo the Grate. It was cold and dry and had no bacon and only two pieces of artichoke. My wife had the Chicken Parmigiana which was overcooked and very greasy. The one bright spot was the Wood-Roasted Cauliflower appetizer. Overall, it was a bad experience that makes choosing Flatbread the next time we dine-out not one of our options.",

Staff was super friendly and were super quick with the drinks. can\u2019t wait to bring my fianc\u00e9 and other people here. I recommend calling ahead for reservations, especially if you want a cool window seat.

Their food never fails to make me happy. I usually get the Margherita pizza, but I decided to branch out this time and try something new. I haven\u2019t had much experience with carpaccio, so I was a little anxious, but that changed when I had my first bite. The carpaccio was delicious, and all the ingredients and toppings on this pizza mixed in together so well. 10/10 as always. They have some delicious drinks as well!",

Got our bill tonight. Only 3 drinks were discounted at 30%, everything else was full price. Asked to speak to the manager who informed me \" Sorry we changed our happy hour pricing and the table advertisements are old but we already charged your card, there isn't anything I can do.

The environment was casual and friendly and there was an authentic pizza oven at the center. Pretty cool to me plus you couldn't smell any burning oil or smoke in there which is an issue for me at indoor busy restaurants. Our server was shaved head long bearded gentleman who gave us an extraordinary service. We ordered roasted tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizer which was one of the best appetizers I had so far! It is spicy hot as it should be! The pizza was authentic and taste delicious!the ingredients were fresh!  Do not expect anything like your usual Domino's pizza. This is different! If you feel like eating greasy salty pizza, don't go here this time! But if you feel like eating Italian pizza this is the place!",

Because we were first timers our waiter gave us the detailed low-down on what everything is in a professional friendly manner. My mother has sight problems and he was so very patient with her which I very much appreciated. My brother has social anxiety and speaks low when near many people, our waiter simply got closer and spoke to him, almost kinder I would like to say. I wish I remembered our hostess and waiters name!! Their selection of items was incredibly inclusive to those who are vegan, food allergies and of course our meat eaters! Food preparation was beautiful (not sure authentic because I'm not Italian nor know what the authentic dishes look like...) we definitely thought we didnt order enough food until we started eating! It was more than enough with left overs to take on the road! Keep up the amazing service and foods we will sure to be back!",

The best time to get their great food at a reasonable price is during happy hour.  M-F 4-6 and Weekends 9-close.  So, it is a great place for a snack and a drink right after work.  The service at the downtown location has also seemed to slip every since moving into the new building.  I highly recommend it for their food but be prepared to drop some coin and be patient.",

        "caption": "We've eaten at Flatbread quite a few times, going back to their original location downtown.  Always had enjoyed the food and the funky-friendly vibe.  The new location is not as warm, or inviting, but it seemed to still be friendly enough, and we have really liked the food.  So, we've continued to go, but recently our experience wasn't as enjoyable.  Our server was either having a horrible rotten day, or we did something to offend him.  We may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when we ordered hot tea, and asked what kinds of tea they had---so he brought a small carrier to the table with several tea bags, and then left not to be seen again for 10 minutes or so.  When he finally appeared again, we asked him if we could have some hot water to put the tea IN. With evident exasperation, he said he'd been waiting (really? where?) for us to pick which of the tea bags we wanted to use.  Hmm.  Then, after our two pizzas were brought to the table (and summarily dropped without a word), we noticed something.  One of the specialty pies we'd ordered was missing one of the meat toppings. The server was long gone, of course, but we managed to flag him down, and ask about the missing topping.  He simply said, \"You're wrong, it's there\" ---arguing with us and practically poking his finger in the pizza, apparently in the belief that if he was emphatic enough we would shut up.  When that didn't work, he grabbed the plate and left, saying he would put the topping on (whether we wanted it that way or not, apparently).  We weren't sure what he was going to do.  But then he brought the plate back with the (cold) topping flopped down onto the pizza.  Well.  That was interesting. Later, a manager came over, knelt down so her face was barely a foot away from us, and started chatting with us about how the person in the kitchen whose job it was to put the topping onto the pie had in fact screwed up and hadn't put it on. She apologized, but kindly pointed out that the particular topping in question goes onto the pizza AFTER baking, so the fact that the server had tossed it on midway through our meal shouldn't have mattered.  (Ok. Well, if that was the case, and the pie wasn't supposed to have this topping until AFTER being cooked, why did the server argue with us and try to convince us the cooked pizza actually DID have the missing ingredient?)  So.  If you judge a restaurant solely by the quality of the food, this probably could--or should--be a four or five-star review.  The food at FlatBread is good. But there's lots of places that have good food.  What sets a restaurant apart (especially one which charges about $20 per entree) is the quality of the experience.  So, this particular night left us thinking we might try somewhere else next time.  But I will also say that the manager did make a deduction on our ticket, for half the cost of the pizza in question.  That was much appreciated, and pulls this review up from a \"two-star\" to a \"three-star\".",
