The proprietor is a super nice guy and was really great to interact with. You MUST order in advance by texting the phone number. You will be sent the menu for the day - it changes based on ingredients and such - and you can text back your order. It is a busy place but It worked seamlessly for us. We will DEFINITELY be ordering again. Could not recommend more highly.",

I ended up ordering 2 Colombian vegan potato empanadas, 2 cheese lover empanadas and 1 arepa con queso. My friend got the Cubano. Everything was absolutely delicious. The sauces were icing on the cake. I may go back again before I head back to Florida. Alex was also a pleasure to talk to. Thanks Alex!!",

When we got there we were able to order sofrito chicken, vegan potato and beef and potato. The sofrito one was so delicious and so full of flavor! All of them were really good. This is no fast food truck, it's made to order air fried empanadas. If available, Alex also makes Cubano Sandwiches he bakes his own bread. So if you're not wanting to wait I suggest to call him up to check on the wait times for the food, and to see what he will have available for food. This spot is definitely worth the wait!",

He opens at night and tends to sell out.  If you ask \"whats good?\", Alex will inform you that \"It doesn't matter, it's all good... What are you in the mood for?\"  He uses an air fryer so they come out hot and crispy, not oily.  He makes his own bread for the Cuban Hotdogs.  Wait times vary from no wait to where you put your order in (or call it) and pick it up later.  I'm always able to get pretty fast service.  He accepts cash AND card!  Please like this review to help uncover this hidden gem.  Tip: Park on the street in one of the availabe EWA Hotel spaces.  They are reserved but you'll be able to supervise your car while you eat.  Its a one way street so if the toe truck comes run for the car and offer the tow operator an Empanada and it's settled.",

Why not five stars you might ask, well because regardless of if there\u2019s two people outside his \u201ctruck\u201d or ten he will always say he\u2019s busy, and he moves around inside like a mad mad. The issue as to why he\u2019s so stressed as I watched him for the thirty minutes it took to get out food is that everything comes out of the fridge/ freezer and he puts each order into one infrared style dome cooker. These items are cooked to order from cold or frozen, and that just takes time, eventually he runs out of space causing a backlog. I\u2019m unsure of why he can\u2019t run a second cooker, but there seems to be some pageantry that goes into convincing people he\u2019s busier than he his, simply to stall for the cooking time of these pre made then frozen delights. If you want to try this place which you should, then drop him a text message and ask him to order in advance, take a nice slow walk to the nearest ABC store for a cold beverage and when you get there to collect your 4 to 6 empanadas per person you\u2019ll be happy you did and can avoid the performance that reminded me of someone selling fake perfume or Rolex\u2019s on a subway car.",

Wait time can seem pretty long- we\u2019ve been there with over an hour wait before! Try to get there early. He\u2019s usually setting up shop sometime between 7 and 8 but runs late into the night. Dipping your empanada in both the green sauce and white sauce is my favorite way to eat them. My family was here to help me move this past week and we visited Alex three times!

Some are made in corn and others in flour so have a few to find your favorite. All of them are made fresh in an air fryer. I highly recommend the garlic sauce and the house made hot sauce which is both flavorful and spicy. I look forward to when he begins to bottle it as I will be placing an order from back home.",

The food is fantastic, and the service makes you feel glad that you came. They usually have about 4-6 flavors of empanadas, and they change daily, so your tastebuds experience a new treat every time you go. Do yourself a favor and accept all the sauces they recommend, they are homemade, authentic, and phenomenal. They also serve arepas, which are equally awesome. The one menu item that is always on the menu (if you get there early enough before they've sold out, that is) is the cubano sandwich. Order one - you'll instantly discover why they sell out daily. They also serve sodas from Latin America that aren't available in your local grocery store, so order one with your meal for a truly international experience right here in Waik\u012bk\u012b!",

We tried four kinds - I think the \"vegetable one\" (that's what my boyfriend said it was but it 100% had meat in it...) was our least favourite; my favourite were chicken and the really weird pineapple!!  Hot, fresh, and well priced.  Good dipping sauces, although don't be a tool and spill the ranch-like one all over your entire hotel room because it smellllllls.",

Cooked up and flattened down it all just comes together so well. The pink and white sauces are great additions, and if you\u2019re lucky they\u2019ll have the hot green sauce as well. It really brings the heat. Chef Alex, Chief Empanada Officer, is super friendly and helpful. It\u2019s a great pleasure doing business with nice people who make awesome food. This little trailer is usually up and running at 11:30am, but I recommend calling before you go. The hours can be variable, and they\u2019re happy to get something started for you so it\u2019s ready when you arrive.",
