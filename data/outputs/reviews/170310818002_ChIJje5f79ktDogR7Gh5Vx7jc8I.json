I got the L&R salad with chicken tinga & can\u2019t wait to get it again. We\u2019ve tried the fish tacos, steak tacos, the guacamole, Frijoles Charros - everything has been delicious. Absolutely recommend giving this local biz a try!",

Order from any Mexican restaurant, you can get 3 tacos with rice and beans for $8-10 order. From here and you can get 3 tacos for $15 that aren\u2019t any better than the tacos from next door. The sauce for the tacos is good don\u2019t get me wrong but would have tasted better smothered in cheese. The corn in the elote was mushy and watery. Wasn\u2019t aware until tonight that corn can be overcooked. Churros and horchata were good according to my sister!",
