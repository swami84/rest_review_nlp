It smelled so Delicious. My first bite of shrimp was tender....flavorful and the rest is history. I enjoyed every bite....The potatoes were large and tender... perfect for dipping in the sauce. I Ioved the crab legs.....Everything was delicious. I really like how they put a pair of plastic gloves and bib in the bag. I look forward to placing more orders with King of the Sea.

We waited over 3 hours to receive our food while requests to speak to the owner or manager fell on deaf ears. Staff could not provide us with an estimate as to how long we would have to wait. They simply instructed us to \"check back every 15 minutes\". Social distancing rules were not being adhered to at all as customer crowded the establishment demanding updates on their orders. When our order did finally come, it was missing 5 dishes that we had already been charged for. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the order to be rectified. The food was not well seasoned and the lobster was very overcooked and had to be discarded as it simply was inedible. Additionally, there seemed to be boxes of raw seafood left to thaw on the main floor in plain view of the patrons. When questioned, the staff stated they had no idea why the food was left there. That is an issue that could have potentially sickened hundreds of customers. Never again will we dine at this establishment.",

A few samples of the cocktail was provided upon suggestion by the waitress to enable me select what drink to have.  The food was prepped fast and omg can i say quite tasty?! The lobster very succulent and juicy and so were the shrimps, very seasoned and delicious. Occasionally, the waitress stopped by to see how we were doing, the host also checked in on us.  The atmosphere was relaxing, clean and family oriented. You can certainly have a lil family dinner with kids of all ages.  I did witness a family celebrate their birthday and was given a bottle of i believe it was champagne with the sparkly light, not sure if it was on the house or it was requested, but the waitress sang for the celebrant.  It was a wonderful dining experience and I enjoyed every moment.",

The shrimp wasnt warm, tortilla cold, \"slaw\" if you can call  it that, bland. The only reason it was edible was the store bought sirachi mayo lathered on it. The bacon wrapped scallop was ok. Scallop not seasoned. the bacon made it fine because bacon. The lobster over fries... Had a weird taste to it. The fries were great. The boil itself was spectacular. Tasty. We had the jerk & the king seasonings. The fishbowl drink was good; we had the rum punch. We were offered samples of the fishbowl flavours which was awesome. Staff was polite but kind of forgetful. Had to ask for drinks and water refills multiple times. Parking is hard here.",

Great customer service,  good music, great drinks and the food is Phenomenal!!! I\u2019ve been to this place more than 5 times and its always the same nice vibes with amazing food and workers. I always order the snow crabs legs with potatoes and corn with the Latin Cilantro Garlic Lime butter Sauce. (It\u2019s my favorite sauce) If you want to switch it up the Mac and cheese is good and the chicken wings are amazing. You don\u2019t need to put any sauce on the wings or dip the wings into anything. It\u2019s good as it is. A great place for any occasion. The king of the sea is definitely my go to if I want seafood.",

I made reservations and went with a group and they all had the same complaint the music was way to loud, my guest and I had to shout across the table. I asked the waitness was the music always this loud, she said \"yes\". The music was mostly rap and hip hop, which might be fine for a teen or 20's crowd at a club but not for mature people going out to dinner to converse with each other and spending good money. I left with my taste buds satisfied but a slight headache from the music. I hope the owner is reading this and would consider mixing up the music to fit all crowds and adjusting the volume to a reasonable level, which will make a better atmosphere.",

I love how they let you sample their signature drinks before ordering. We love our drinks strong so chose the ones in the pics. The other two were more sweet. We ordered Hennessy wings, Mac n cheese, crab legs and the lobster. Everything was delicious!!! I had the Cajun sauce and my bf had the Latin cilantro something something. Sorry forgot the full name. We left there so full! Will be back! Oh and the waitress was amazing! We met the owner and he was even helping out with cleaning and asking if we were enjoying ourselves. Forgot to mention the music was great as well. Go and support this Black owned business! You will NOT be disappointed. I will be going for Brunch soon.",
