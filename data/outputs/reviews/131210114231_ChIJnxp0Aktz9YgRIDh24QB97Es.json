This place is at a great location in Roswell with a great patio. In March, they will have live music on Friday nights. Also, expect beer and wine to be joining the menu. The Birria Tacos came with a bowl of the sauce used in braising for dipping. The tacos had just enough crunch with good flavor, plenty of meat and very filling. The Birria nachos were big enough to share. Plenty of meat and great presentation; although, I would have liked more jalapenos. But that is a me thing...never enough jalapenos. I highly recommend and I look forward to coming back for the great patio when it is warmer.",

My husband and I drove by after a hike  yesterday, Sunday, and debated about take out or open seating on patio.  At 11:30am we saw there weren't  many people, waitstaff were wearing masks, we felt the tables were adequately socially distanced, and the singer/songwriter was fabulous.  So - wearing our masks (wanting to also protect waitstaff and others before receiving our food) we sat down.  Unfortunately the proprietor was mingling freely within a couple feet of his patrons, including us,  without a mask.  Our Governor' mandates masks and other precautions  for restaurants in his 40 page Executive Order which I read after our experience. Enough said.  Shrimp and Grits were quite good - but unfortunately we won't be going back.  Counting 14 days... Not following guidelines is a dangerous game for patrons, employees and for the economy.",

When we walked in, it wasn't too crowded, and we were greeted immediately by the staff. The made us feel at home and offered us any seat in the house. We chose to sit near the back as there was live music being played in the front of the restaurant. Nicole took care of us once we were seated. Now Nicole and I had this love hate relationship. Why you ask... because she proceeds to tell us that she did not like sports, but she was a newfound New Orleans \"AINTS\" fan! I immediately asked to be moved to another section. I kid..I kid... It was all in good fun as Atlanta and New Orleans are big rivals.  Despite Nicole being a fan of that other team... she took very good care of us. She recommended the Southern Egg Rolls, The Swiss Bacon Mushroom Burger and the Shrimp and Grits. While I hate to give anybody, who roots for that team any credit... Nicole was spot on. The food was phenomenal.  The egg rolls where certainly something I had never had before... They had apple wood smoked pork as the meat with BBQ sauce and slaw on the side.  The burger while cooked to perfection and seasoned well... it didn't have anything on that Shrimp & Grits dish! Let me tell you... I'm a Fat A$$ and I love food and I will admit this without hesitation. This Shrimp & Grits was the best I've had so far. This DISH gave me LIFE. All the flavors were perfect and the HEAT (Spices that is) was on point. I certainly will go back to have this dish again. Compliments to the chef!  On my next visit I will also try the Rib Eye... that was my mom's favorite cut of meat and now its mines. I was eyeballing the Rib Eye on another plate.  I highly encourage you all to pay them a visit. If you are a Falcon's Fan... avoid Nicole's section! I'm just kidding. You all won't be disappointed in this establishment.

Skirt steak melted in my mouth and the fancy small potatoes with the fire roasted red pepper relish with fresh rosemary was just to die for! Well worth the money for sure. I highly recommend this cozy but truly unforgettable place. One of the best steak dishes I've had so far (sorry, picture does not show much of the steak as I devoured it before I took the photo)",

That being said, the staff were friendly and apologetic. They had a couple of big groups come in at the same time as us which was the reason for the delay. We ate outside on the patio and the staff were friendly and welcoming to our kiddos playing and dancing to the music. The food was good quality and prepared with care. The parking was a bit cramped, but ok. Worth checking out of your in the area.",

Located south of Downtown Roswell, and next to a noisy roadway, this establishment serves New Orleans seafood and cuisine. They have a spacious patio, and although their food may be good, the portions leave much to be desired.  It took absolutely forever for us to get our order - a beer and a couple appetizers, and when it arrived, we were disappointed. It seems trendy to up charge on appetizers to set the expectation for the entrees. After reviewing the options, I would have chosen a steakhouse as they would have offered more seafood options and a better atmosphere. All the bet to this restaurant and its owner, but I won't be heading back.",

This is a warm and inviting place and probably the first place I have been to that understands that live music should be part of the background and not take over the entire place.   Their drink selection was on point and my meal (Steak with Garlic Potatoes) was amazing.  My fiancee got the Salmon and I was told it was just as amazing.  Go ahead and save room for dessert it is worth the extra money.  their dessert menu is impressive.  I had gotten something to share with my fiancee but next time I will be getting my own, There was plenty to share but it was so good I think next time I won't want to.  I was told they have an entirely different menu for lunches so I am definitely making it a point to go back for lunch one day in the near future hopefully when it is warm enough to use the amazing patio space they have.

We had the $15 pound of wings and 2 drafts, Southern  BBQ spring rolls, and fries.  The wings were amazing - smoked with a whiskey and creole mustard glaze - really, these wings are some of the best I've had.  They have a flavor profile that you usually don't associate with wings - pretty special.  The Southern Egg Rolls are a meal in themselves - smokey apple BBQ pork and some dipping sauce.  Didn't care for the coleslaw served with this dish - but I'm not a coleslaw guy.  The handmade fries were fresh out of the fryer and cooked to perfection.  The food will get me to come back and Carl and his staff make me feel like family.  Give Chipper's Club a try - you'll come back again if you do.",

After speaking with the server I found out that the joint opened up 3 months ago.  There were a lot of enticing things on the menu, but you should try the Chattahoochee Sweet & Spicy fried chicken... You'll thank me later.  Exactly as its name suggests - it starts out sweet, almost with a honey taste and ends with a spiciness, but not overpowering.  The chicken was fresh and well cooked ... It's making me hungry just writing about it.  You should definitely grab a table on the patio on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday evening; enjoy some live music; and eat some delicious food.",
