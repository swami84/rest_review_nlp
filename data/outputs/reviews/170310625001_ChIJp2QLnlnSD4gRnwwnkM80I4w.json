This place is located right next to two bars which is completely genius and I admire the plan. However. I ordered the Latenight Thai fried rice (it comes with shrimp and special sauce) and I was very excited to wait a moment for it. My order was ready and I walked up to the counter to recieve a plastic takeout container with an oddly orange rice in it. The vegetables and shrimp were without a doubt frozen and lacked all flavor. I'm not sure what the special sauce was but it was tolerable at best. I love thai food bit was really shocked at how far from thai fried rice this really was, i really wanted to like it. I do think that if you're famished at 2am and quite hammered, this will do",

We recently finally had our chance to stop by and order - takeout - when we arrived home we immediately looked at each other and said these portions are super super small for the price that they are charging !!! We love Thai food but this restaurant has no idea what the actual taste of Thailand really is.  Their Mongolian Chicken is dry and tasteless, while another chicken dish (Chicken Satay) was covered in oil.  I rather eat a day old fries then anything they make. My recommendation to anyone reading this - do not waste your $. And by the way, their packing is bad too. Everything was leaked by the time we got home.",

We proceeded to enter the establishment but once at the counter we were unsure on how to order. We inquired on how to order but were saddened by their rude and sarcastic remark. Once we had ordered our food we realized that we were quite parched from our journey, and asked the young lady at the counter she simply pointed at the water cooler. My father fancied his water cold like the water of the Appalachian mountains so he made yet another perilous journey to ask the counter people for ice. Upon his arrival to the counter she asked is there anything else you would like very sarcastically. My father was livid at the fact that the staff was being so rude it almost seemed like they didn't want our business. So my father asked for the food to go once the meal was ready we got up to get and were given a dirty look upon taking it from the counter. We just ended up eating the food by our car although the only really redeeming experience was the food the sashimi and maki were pretty good as well as the fried rice.",

Yet the guy, acting like it was no big deal, insisted that if I didn't get a receipt, that the withdrawal wouldn't go through. He then changes the box inside the ATM, and sure enough I saw 2 $20 bills still hanging off that box.  I found that to be pretty sketchy.  I still ordered food and I thought the pad Thai was amazing, and the crab ragoons were good, for how cheap they are.  I am not writing this review just because I got ripped off $20. I didn't like how he handled the situation, and as a customer, would rather try a better Thai service elsewhere in Chicago.",

This place couldn't have been more perfect. The service was good, we didn't have to wait very long for anything that we ordered. We had an appetizer of steamed shrimp dumplings that were great. The Panang Curry was mild and thicker than I am used to, but had a good balance of the coconut milk base, curry, vegetables and tofu they used. My friend had the Massaman Curry with similar experience. Everything tasted great, though I could have used a little more thai basil as that was really what set my dish off. Not the absolute best Thai food in Chicago, but also not the most expensive place either. The prices were good and I had a very enjoyable experience and would definitely go back.",

I went up to tell them nicely that this wasn't what I ordered (usually I hate complaining and even if my food isn't right I eat it anyway but this was UNBEARABLY hot! Coming from someone who does actually like spicy things this wasn't at all edible.) \"The man who seemed like the manager said \"too bad that's how it comes you can't get another one.\" I couldn't believe how rude and uncaring of my service they where! I asked him please sir I need something else my kid are burning. He said no. I couldn't get the dish I wanted in the first place and I couldn't get my money back. It's a waste of money for a small portion. $20 dollars for a plate that isn't even big enough to fill someone up and I can't even get it that way I'd like?
