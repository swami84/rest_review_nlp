Most vegan meals so start with a finished dish, remove the meat, and them try desperately to replace it. At Elizabeth's, they start with ingredients that just so happen not to include any meat or animal products, and construct amazing meals from them. A definite favorite to take any acquaintance to.",

The strictly vegan (and mostly raw) food and drinks were perfectly balanced and seasoned and incredibly creative, with stunning presentation! There were smoked cocktails, yummy kale chips, sweet stuffed pepper with garlic \"cheese\", Savoy cabbage with \"caviar\", beet ravioli, fresh sorbet palette cleanser, and a beautiful delicious dessert with seasonal fruit. We left feeling satiated but light, unlike how we normally would after a 6 course meal. I can't wait until our next visit!",

They have a coat check, very helpful since it was freezing outside. At the bar, they have kale chips and delicious beverage options including some nonalcoholic options. Once our table was ready we made out way upstairs. The environment is wonderfully elegant. We enjoyed some of their tea selection instead of wine, worked very well for us. And the dining room was nice and quiet during our 6:30pm reservation. It got a lot more lively when we left around 8pm. The dining experience was excellent, the coordination of the servers upon delivery of the food and the calm professionalism of all the staff was perfect. It is a very nice gastric experience that I highly recommend people enjoy at least once.",

Not what I'd expect for fine dining but it actually for the vibe perfectly. I also appreciated that most of the staff I saw (all but 2 people) were female.

When asked for a drink recommendation he read us the entire cocktail list. When we left we immediately went to get dinner (that's actually how little food you get).

We planned a date night for Elizabeth's Gone Raw a couple of weeks ago. We made a reservation via Open Table and we were both excited about the reviews we read. We were called the day before to confirm the reservation, which we did. We drove from Ashburn to eat here(about an hour with some traffic). We parked and started walking to the front door at around 9:15 pm when saw my phone ringing. I missed the call but saw they left a voicemail. I listened to the voicemail as we were walking up the steps and it said we were late for our 9:00 pm reservation and that they needed to hear from us soon. I was under the assumption our reservation was at 9:30 so I thought we were early. We walked in and explained that I just received a voicemail but I thought the reservation was at 9:30 which is why we were late. Before I finished my sentence, the host said: \"I'm so sorry but we closed our kitchen, but did you want to make a new reservation for next week?\" I explained that I just got the voicemail as I was walking up the steps which said to contact them soon which we did seconds later by walking in. I also knew they were open until 10 and they take reservations at 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm via open table and asked why the kitchen would close before either of those times. He apologized again and said we cannot eat because the kitchen is closed. I expressed my frustration with that level of service and we both left. I never in my life walked into a restaurant in a big city on a Saturday night and were turned down service 40 minutes before they accept their last reservation and/or close! We both left furious that we just drove this far and took the night off only to be turned away. As I was outside, I snapped one photo of the building and a gentleman came out and apologized again but told me it was my fault because I was late for my reservation. I then snapped and explained again that they don't close for another 40 minutes and they accept reservations until 10 pm so why would the kitchen be closed?! He went back inside and as I was walking away the owner came out. She offered to serve us but at that point, I wanted nothing to do with that establishment. The owner seemed like a nice lady but why anyone in her restaurant would turn away any customers, especially with reservations, 40 minutes before they close is ridiculous. Again, we got a voicemail that said to contact them soon and we walked in seconds later. We then were immediately turned away and then told it was our fault by some other man. I understand arriving late for a reservation is our fault and if the restaurant was full because the table was given away, I would have accepted that but to be turned away because they just decided to close their kitchen is horrible. Needless to say, we will never return here which is sad because we were very excited to try it out. Beware if you want to visit this place that they might just close without telling you or anyone else.",

The presentation of every dish is pure art and I also highly recommend to get wine pairings with your meal. I found some of the best wines I ever had there!

I went there to celebrate the birthday of a friend who has gone vegan.  The food at Elizabeth's Gone Raw needs no high-minded justification.  It speaks for itself as an exquisite expression of the culinary arts -- varied, delicious, based on novel combinations of ingredients, and brilliantly composed in terms of color, texture, taste, and presentation.  The chef  produces truly memorable dishes by combining ingredients I would normally disdain.  Even if one is not in sympathy with veganism, this is about as good a dining experience as you will ever have.  The service at EGR is impeccable.  The ambience is elegant.  The sound level and table separation enable conversation.  This is cuisine to savor and a restaurant to treasure.",

Needless to say, I came into dinner with a lack of enthusiasm (because I'm not a vegetarian).  Upon entering you are at the bar, it is succinct and we'll curated, with a casual unassuming atmosphere. That ability to offer quality over quantity is an art Elizabeth's has mastered.  The hostess ushered us upstairs to the dining room where there is very little of the noise I expect from a restaurant. The sound of pleasant conversation was stifled by kitchen sounds, which made me more expectant of a unique experience.  Admittedly, I was hard sell on a meal that didn't involve a fish or beef dish, but our waitress was a good sport about it. Also, as the courses were presented, she described each dish with an infectious enthusiasm. And to be honest, everything (this is hard for me to say)EVERYTHING was just delightful. There was a soup (with lemongrass or wheat grass) that was delicious! A tempura stuffed with... I'm not sure (but I really enjoyed it).  By the end of the service I was completely sold on returning of my own accord. Elizabeth's has every aspect of restaurateuring down pat. A remarkable wait staff, inspired foods, and a relaxed atmosphere created a unique experience that was DC dining at its finest.  Every star was well deserved!",

Each dish was crafted with a kind of passion and vision that I have never before experienced; each course promised flavors and textures I have never before tasted. My friends and I, one vegetarian and two meat-eaters, were continually wowed by the dishes and I firmly believe that diners with an open mind, vegan or not, will be as impressed as we were by EGR. I recall reading in another review that EGR offers \u201cart you can eat.\u201d Each dish in June\u2019s tasting menu was indeed its own unique piece of art from amuse to dessert; from vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes and other \u201csimple\u201d or even \u201cboring\u201d ingredients in the eyes of some, true skill and imagination of the chef elevates them to something amazing. Each course is to be fully appreciated in tandem with the equally artful wine pairing by Dora, the restaurant\u2019s sommelier who was both a knowledgeable and delightful presence throughout our meal. EGR\u2019s art goes even beyond the food and touches every corner of the experience-- the candlelit, intimate atmosphere, the flowers, the decor, and the warmth and careful service of each and every member of the staff.  Elizabeth\u2019s Gone Raw is a dining experience that is distinct and special in each and every bite and moment. To give it five stars, two thumbs up, and the highest recommendation just doesn\u2019t feel like enough. Beyond my endorsement, I\u2019ll let the June tasting menu and a photo of my favorite course speak for itself.",

The limitations on traditional 'food' are tremendous and it is an absolute delight to see what can be created under these circumstances. The food was simply beautiful. The service was the best I have ever had in the city. I'm a harsh critic of service and the staff and Elizabeth herself, made the experience memorable.  The individual plates are works of art - in many cases, unique. Those used to heated, cooked meals need to leave expectations at the door and enter a new world. It is a world not unlike Willy Wonka's where the next plate is a total surprise.  My husband eats vegan and for him this was minerva. I'm a regular human, as he says, and I was delighted at the surprises presented to me.  Elizabeth's is a magical experience. And worth the wait and cost.  When you look at the meal and ask a few questions, you understand the amount of creativity and preparation that goes into each item, the love of the quest to create within constraints, the ability to extract the best from ingredients.  If you cannot check traditional expectations at the door, Elizabeth's may not be for you, but if you are willing to enter Willy Wonka's world, step inside Elizabeth's kitchen.",

The service was good and surroundings nice but the food didn't meet our expectations the prices are very very high for what you get. Not sure what we even spent it on for our $250.00 bill. I think we could have eaten in the finest restaurant in D.C. for less than this. Not sure where all the 5 star reviews came from because it wasn't that special. In fact it was a disappointment.",

She is a vegetarian and I'm not, but we eat vegetarian meals regularly so I was excited to try this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  The Good: The decor was really nice and the service was truly excellent, which made the food all the more disappointing.  The Bad: This was hands-down the worst meal I have ever had in this city. And I've lived in the District for 14 years. The salad of lima beans and fava beans tasted like dirt, the sauces did nothing to help mask it. The main course--a polenta dish--was gummy and paste-like and tasted awful.  The Ugly: And it was not cheap. We ordered the tasting menu and one of the least expensive bottles of wine and the bill came to $250 (including tip). I know taste is subjective, but we both left extremely disappointed. I'm not sure how anyone could really enjoy this food.",

Elizabeth Petty, the founder and owner, started Elizabeth's Gone Raw, the vegan restaurant that's only open Friday nights and offers a six course tasting menu, as well as a catering company. Elizabeth's on L is their private venue that Ms. Petty bought 11 years ago (formerly a federalist townhouse) and renovated into a gorgeous, open space that comfortably seats up to 90 guests. They also cater off-site.  I came here for a work lunch to discuss renewable energy and green initiatives. Elizabeth's on L was the perfect venue for this roundtable discussion. Everyone mingled downstairs while the staff set up upstairs. Once they were done setting up, we were taken upstairs where in the main area, there was a long table for us to dine at. There was also another waiting/mingling area that faced the street, enough for all of us to stand and talk. The table was set up with immaculate place settings and decorated with fresh flowers in the center.  After we all sat down, staff members bought out both sweetened and unsweetened ice tea and then the first course. Elizabeth Petty was there to give a brief introduction into Elizabeth's on L and Elizabeth's Gone Raw. Another staff member talked about what the appetizer was before we started eating and going into our discussion.  The three courses were: + Beet and apple ravioli with macadamia nut ricotta and fennel foam + Green papaya risotto with wild mushrooms, asparagus, and nut parmesan + Strawberry cake with banana buttercream  My favorite was probably the beet and apple ravioli. I think it had the most complexity in terms of flavors. Staff would replenish waters and teas quickly and take our empty dishes and silverware and replace with new courses efficiently. All staff members were highly professional and friendly. We had a guest speaker present for most of the lunch, but the staff moved around discreetly and skillfully while still switching out courses. At the end of our guest speaker's presentation, the staff discussed the other courses we ate.  This venue does not charge a booking fee, so if you're looking for a cozy and chic place to hold a dinner party, cocktail hour, professional forums, or even a wedding reception, you should definitely consider this space. The space is decorated with paintings, rugs, and even a fireplace.",
