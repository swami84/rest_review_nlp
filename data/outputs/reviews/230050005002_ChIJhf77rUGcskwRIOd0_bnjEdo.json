The food was good, better than average bar fare. It was clean and quiet for lunch but I do not think they expect a lunch crowd. They do some specials for evening/night time plus other events like trivia. In addition to their oven versed beers, they have a full liquor bar, wine, and canned macro brews. Sit at the bar, booths inside, or tables outside",

It all started when we first got here an the hostess didn't show up for about ten minutes. Granted yes we could of left but on a Sunday night during Fourth of July weekend it was the one of the few places open. 45 minutes from sitting down we finally received plates and napkins for our appetizers. I got very excited thinking the food was one it's way but 30 mins later and still nothing. I ordered another drink, the bonfire spirit because of the advertisement on our table. That took about 15 mins and it showed up in a glass the same size of a shot glass. I'm still here waiting for my food. I can definitely see why they are open until 1 am. P.S. This place is disrespectfully under staffed. The poor hostess was the bus boy, waiter, and every other position possible.",

The location is fine, but it feels like you should check in before getting a table.  We were there at about 9pm, it was busy but not packed.  We were seated, but that was it.  10 minutes went by and no waiter.  I am patient, but there seemed to be a lot of staff.  Our order was going to contain food as well as drinks, but the lack of attention was disheartening so we ordered a beer and left.  I understand that taste is subjective, but I ordered a hazy IPA which was a clear red colored ale.  Maybe it is just that the other area spots had a lot more going on for them, but Sebago was just not doing it for us.",
