        "caption": "I had to review this place as it is probably my new favorite Indian restaurant in all of chicago (and I've tried many) The menu caught my eye when I was walking down the street and I had to try - I got the butter chicken combo meal with dal curry (very cheap at only $12.49) and was blown away by how good every single item was. Another important reason I rate this restaurant so highly is because of how the menu is formatted - basically all the hits are on there and nothing unnecessary. Quite a concise menu for an Indian restaurant (not to mention the southern dishes) which I think would make it friendly for someone not familiar with these cuisines. Everything is translated or clarified for americans and it is more of an American style single person portions - most indian restaurants are oriented towards family-style groups and portions/price reflect this. I also had the peach cobbler and gulab jaman which were both great! My only complaint is that I did not know about this place sooner!",

The first time I attempted the restaurant I parked on 53rd and walked up at 8:10 (after a 12 hour shift on the front lines!). The guy, while polite, was like no \"these hours are wrong, we're closed\". I was craving good Indian which this is the only South Asian food available for miles, so while disappointed the owner didn't seem interested in my business I wanted so much to try again and enjoy the food (and turn that negative encounter into a positive one)  Unfortunately, nah. I got the veggie platter with aloo gobi and dal.  They tasted way too sweet!  The rice had ok flavor. Paratha solid. Samosa was fine.  Will not go out of my way to return.  Sunny store front is nice.",

I suspect that when it opened the owner thought that they would compete against \"Popeye's Chicken\", hence then name \"Rajun Cajun\", but found that they sold just as much, if not more, Indian dishes.  I would guess that the majority of there business is take out.  The restaurant is small with few tables.  Eating there is fine, I'm sure, for the many U of C student in the neighborhood, but most post college people will want to just take out.  The Indian menu is limited to about five item and about eight sides.  Of course they have Tandoori Chicken and an optional vegetarian selection.  The food is quite decent although it will not compete with the larger Indian restaurants you fine on Chicago's far north side.",

Two vegetable meals of rice, two curries and one fried chicken in foam plates, all put on one plate for 40$.This spot goes against the usual tradition of finding wonderful ethnic food spots in college towns and especially Chicago which has one of the largest collection of best Indian Restaurants.

Customer Service - The owner who I met in the front counter(older male) was horrible at customer service. I was late to pick up my order and like most places I assumed they would have it just ready and I had no problem taking it home cold since It was my fault for picking up late. INSTEAD the owner decides to snap at me and make a huge scene in front of his other customers for me being late to pick up the order. By the way the order was already paid for so I am not sure what the big deal was but he decides to sarcastically mock me in front of others. I was in shock because of his behavior. To be frank the guy is douche bag! I 2. Food - I bought a whole tandoori CHICKEN and came home and opened the order and felt it seemed like it was not a whole chicken because the pieces were cut. I descided to weigh it and it was less than 2lbs of \"whole chicken\".RIP OFF BECAUSE I PAID ALMOST 16$ DOLLARS for a whole chicken and an extra leg quarter. 3. Once I started eating the food was BLAND, NO TANDORRI FLAVOR BECAUSE IT WAS BAKED INSTEAD OF BEING GRILLED. These ppl sell FAKE WANA-BE INDIAN FOOD. CONCLUSION - I REGRET SPENDING EVEN A PENNY ON THIS GARBAGE PLACE because this place is a disgrace to Indian cuisine.",

It only had peas, few cheese cubes and somewhat sweetish gravy -- not the way it is supposed to be cooked. Parotha was extremely terrible. Better buy any frozen Parotha by Haldiram's in any Indian Grocery Store. Samosa shouldn't be called \"Samosa\" by any standard. Was not crisp as it is supposed to be, but was very soggy.  Again, there are plenty of frozen options in Indian stores that taste million times better. Even boiled rice sucked, not sure which variety of rice these guys are using.",

They also give you a ton of food for how much you end up spending. The dinner combos are nice if you're dining there or eating alone, but if you have a group of people eating together I strongly recommend ordering mediums to larges of a few items a la carte and sharing them. You'll probably still have leftovers anyway. My other rule of thumb is to always get one more samosa than you think you'll actually want to eat. This has never backfired on me.",
