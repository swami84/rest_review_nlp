Something I hate to go to is the place I searched for. Lunch specials include squid stir-fry and meat stir-fry. Sunda-bu is as good as a Korean restaurant. Because it is open shop this year, it is clean inside, and food is purged.  The sauteed squid is better than the stir fry. If you rub rice in the sauce, it's just over. It is also okay to have rice as a high-grade rice and egg jjimim? The server was very friendly too, so I gave it a tip. I would like to have Sundu in Seoul until the day I visit Hawaii again.

I am a big fan of banchan and theirs was very good.  The tofu soup is a little different then small mom and pop authentic Korean restaurants, but I liked it all the same.  Only complaint I had was that the seating seemed a little tight. Was there during a slow time of day and would probably not feel comfortable if it was busy.
