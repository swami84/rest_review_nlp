Food was timed perfectly despite being there on a Saturday at peak time. The kitchen had it all under control and the servers made sure everything got where it was going on time. Speaking of the food...WOW....such a unique menu and very blatantly designed by a chef with years of education and experience. Each dish was a combination of opposing flavors which came together to create a perfect harmony. You don't create these type of dishes by chance...there is some serious skill in the kitchen at Fat Hen. Wine list was superb, signature cocktails looked amazing but the wine list honestly spoke to clearly to my heart that I had to opt for a paired four course dinner. I was not disappointed. Rib eye and the scallop crudo stood out, but it was all simply decadent. 10/10 will be back.",

Having said that I would not call this an Italian restaurant. I came wanting to try the gnocchi and ended up going with the chef's whim 6 course tasting menu, but requested the gnocchi as one of the courses. Having the chef deliver and describe each of his creations shows his passion for the food. The meal started with smoked bluefish which was delicate and presented perfectly. The next course was hamachi crudo which was my second favorite with a balanced sweetness from Meyer lemons and a surprise with the inclusion of chili oil. This was followed by foie gras which was a little salty until mixed with the quince and cocoa. The potato gnocchi was my favorite and worth waiting for. This dish was a contrast in textures and deep flavors. The rainbow trout was tender with a crispy skin and as much as I like bacon, it felt unnecessary. I was excited to try the NY strip steak which was cooked sous vide and then seared. While it was cooked well, it was missing the deep sear I prefer in a steak. The meal was completed with baked doughnuts which were delicious. It feels like the restaurant and chef are using different influences and techniques to showcase their food, but are still trying to find a true identity. They have a small, cozy interior except for the large plate glass on one wall where the fluorescent street lights shine through. Overall it was a very good experience and I look forward to returning and experiencing more of their ever changing menu.",

The bass was excellent and was served over an awesome pea salad dish. The steak was also fabulous and came with these amazing fried potato gratin cube things, they were really awesome. We got two desserts, blackberry panna Cotta was not good. The actual panna cotta was bland and completely overwhelmed by a champagne topping. The white chocolate semifredo with strawberry gelato was incredible!!!! One of the best desserts I\u2019ve had in a long time.  Really great service and all around really nice experience.",

Her first course was a ravioli that tasted amazing but consisted of only 4 tiny raviolis for $17. Her second course centered around a steak, which they did not ask her how she wanted it prepared and it came out very rare. We took that to go and I grilled it more (to medium) and it tasted very good. I had the rabbit gnocci and the braised short ribs. Both tasted excellent and I had no complaints. I also had a Negroni cocktail which was amazing. 3 stars is a mix of mine and my girlfriends experiences.",

        "caption": "Uncluttered menu with straightforward, solid food! Delicious! Pasta portions were generous. Entrees were small but well-composed - e.g. a main protein, a sauce, and vegetable garnish. These entrees seem not to be \"big plates,\" where the protein is often accompanied by a side veg and starch. Still everything was delicious. Desserts were unfussy - usually a main component with a complementing garnish, but perhaps could use one more textural element for crunch. Service was fast and friendly and did not decline when the place filled up.",
