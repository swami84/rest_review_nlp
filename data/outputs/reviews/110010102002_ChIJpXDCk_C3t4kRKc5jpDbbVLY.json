Charlie is awesome, friendly, and helpful with sweet tips to add to your pizza- for instance he suggested adding honey onto pizza. Like get outta here, who would\u2019ve thought, and it\u2019s SUPER good, especially on the veggie or the cheese and tomato pie.  My second time, wasn\u2019t so pleasant and I do not remember the woman\u2019s name who helped me, however the owner- Luke, was very helpful and invited me back for a third try.  Third time\u2019s the charm, and I saw Charlie again and he made sure I enjoyed my ordering experience as well as making sure my pizza was exactly what I wanted.  The pizza is yummy and the crust is made perfectly. If you live walking distance definitely walk here and give Union Pie a try. If you aren\u2019t in walking distance and want to have a great half or whole pie, totally take the metro, Uber/Lyft, or drive down to the Wharf. You won\u2019t be disappointed.  Prices are great also.",

I appreciate the pies are made to order, but don\u2019t lie to get the business. You have plenty of business otherwise to let a customer go. So my boy and I had to make a choice to not eat and get a good spot for the show or wait to get the pie and miss getting a good spot.  And talking with everyone here they all agree. They told us all 20 minutes and there is no one who has been here less than 35 minutes.",
