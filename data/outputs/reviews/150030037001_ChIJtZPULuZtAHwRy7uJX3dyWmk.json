I put my mask on flip flops and started the journey. It\u2019s tucked away in the center of a shopping center. It\u2019s a beautiful maze of wonderful ness. Finally, behind the curtain of a small cozy booth one of the owners peeped out with the best greeting. A huge smile and gentle hello. (What\u2019s this a mini novel? I\u2019m writing )  Okay... I ordered the vegan chicken, vegan won ton soup and chocolate cake ( don\u2019t judge my ballerina career was over anyway ) I got home loved the soup and had enough the next morning. The chocolate cake... delicious all that was missing was a diamond ring. I would of married anybody just to order it again with 5 tiers. Chicken \ud83d\ude22disappointing. I\u2019m going back for lasagna it looked awesome!",

The lemongrass tofu was soggy and flavorless and the chow mein was literally a pile of white spaghetti cooked with cabbage and onions. Not even close to resembling chow mein!!
