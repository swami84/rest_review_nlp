Any time i point this out to them and ask them to change their gloves they frown, give me this disgusted look and on most occasions just toss my sandwich aside and ask someone else to make it.  I must have visited atleast 15subways in the last 2years and this is by far the worst.  Being a vegetarian and expecting some basic subway etiquettes from these folks seems to overwhelm them..",
