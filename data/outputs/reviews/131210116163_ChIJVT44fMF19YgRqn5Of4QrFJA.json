He sat us right behind the hosts\u2019/hostesses\u2019 desk, where we had front row seats  of the hosts and hostesses as they went about their duties with masks partially/fully off!! Our waitress on the other hand was such a breath of fresh air!! She was friendly, attentive and ensured we were well-taken care of the entire time. The food was decent...the shrimp and chorizo dip was the best bite we had all evening. Our food was lukewarm, pretty much cold when it arrived. My Swiss Taverna burger was still pink in the center although I was not asked how I\u2019d like it prepared, the hubby\u2019s hotdogs were bland, cold and the cheese sauce as bland as the dogs. The fried oreos dessert we took home were delicious!! A perfect ending to a not-so-perfect meal.",

Lunch was fantastic. Great menu, superb service, amd fantastic spaces both inside and outside. The CCT \"signature roasted\" wings were very tasty and tender. The generously portioned Asian Shrimp Salad had a nice level of spice and a complex flavor and texture profile.  Our entire dining party was impressed with the experience, and I look forward to a return visit soon. Plenty of free parking in the nearby City Center parking deck.",

I think it is a great place to watch and game, drink beers, and snack but, not a place that I would currently recommend to visit for the main purpose of dining.  I had the Buddha Bowl, which was ok, but could use a little more spice or seasoning.  I added Tabasco sauce but still could not get it where I wanted it.  I also had the buffalo cauliflower, which tasted ok but, had too much breading.  After tasting one piece I extracted the remaining pieces of the cauliflower from the breading. I\u2019ve had buffalo cauliflower at other restaurants where they cook it with the buffalo sauce but, without breading.  I\u2019ll ask CCT if they can prepare it that way when I return.  My wife had the buffalo chicken bowl and she said her bowl was ok, but, had mostly potatoes.  She was happy that her chicken did not have the breading that was on my cauliflower.  I tasted some of her leftover potatoes and thought it had better flavor and spice than my Buddha Bowl.  My daughter had traditional wings without sauce and thought they tasted very good.  She also like the fries but, they had too much seasoning.  I tasted her fries and agree with her opinion.",

I don\u2019t know if the server had too big of a section, but she was the least attentive server I have ever had. The manager was sitting on his phone at the hostess desk. The sandwiches we ordered were good, but ticket times were extremely long (for drinks too). I ordered the  steak and chorizo sandwich. The only problem was, there was no chorizo, they substituted ham, which tasted great, however it was not what I expected. We also ordered guacamole and salsa and it had zero taste and we never got the salsa. We asked for limes to fix up the bland guac... \u201csorry, were out\u201d.  We notified the server that we couldn\u2019t eat it and she apologized. 45 minutes later when she came back to the table we asked for the check.  The check still had the guac on it. We asked them to remove it, so she got the manager to take it off. Remember manager on the phone while the front of the house is going down in flames and the back of the house 86ing items unbeknownst to him or his staff?  He came over and apologized and said \u201cyeah, the kitchen staff ran out of some stuff and just made substitutions to make it work. I apologize, we took it off the check\u201d.  Mr manager- you should know when items are 86\u2019d.  You should know when you servers need help.  And you should be talking to every table at least once in their visit.  Not standing there on your phone until there is a problem  Server- ask for help if you need help.  Communication is key.  If we as the customer know, we will be much more understanding.  Kitchen- make sure all staff know when something is 86\u2019d. Don\u2019t make random substitutions.  In this case ham for chorizo, the ham could have given someone an allergic reaction. Some people are allergic to the curing process of ham but can have other pork products.  EDIT: I stand corrected.  There is supposed to be ham in the steak and chorizo sandwich, although it lacked the chorizo the sandwich was still good. Thank you for management responding. However, please note the food was not the problem...The service and management was the problem.",

The vibe is engaging and energetic.  The drink options are vast with a good selection of craft beers and custom cocktails.  There is an outdoor area that melds into the main restaurant,  so you won't feel left out of the action.  Worth a return trip.  Fish tacos and chili dogs hit the spot, as did the chips and dips.",

Chelsea helped me out the first time I went and she is the perfect person to talk to, not just about their food or drinks but in general. EVERY SINGLE staff member was ready to assist me when ever I needed something. It's always a stressful time starting off a new company but everyone held their composure and took care of everyone that came in. I was extremely impressed. I've been back three time since then and I'm going back tonight. Just a perfect beautiful place, amazing people and outstanding food. I can tell this is the start of a beautiful relationship lol. Now go try this place out.",
