This place used to be amazing with amazing looking sandwiches. I phoned in an order for 2 sandwiches with a side of fries. I arrived and they said they were out of fries. Honestly the only reason I go to E.A.R.L is for the fries. I asked when they ran out and the response was \"Yesterday\". I wish I was told that over the phone before I drove 20 minutes out of my way. Once i got to my office and opened up my sandwich I was very disappointed it reminded me of a McDonald's style sandwich  only it cost me 15 bucks. Not sure if I'll ever go back. It's hard to write a bad review about a restaurant during Covid but it's also hard paying 15 bucks for A Mc Chicken with cheese during Covid.  I just found a hair in my sandwich... Done.",

Already had it twice within the past week. Their po boi chicken sandwich is also unreal. For non-meat eaters or looking for something a little lighter, the fun beet is super fresh and delicious. The lilikoi lemonade is perfect too. It\u2019s not too sweet. The garlic fries were the only downside, they were good but because we can only do take out right now, they got soggy and mushy so I bet they would be better fresh and eaten right away. Can\u2019t recommend this place enough. The staff is friendly and pretty quick service.",

I actually work across the street and had to go to work so my boyfriend stayed and waited. He didn\u2019t get the order until another 15 min when he actually walked up to the register and asked if it was almost done. The guy at the front looked at a order that we saw sitting there for a while and said oh there it is. You\u2019d think if we paid and you saw us standing there for a while you would check on it. My boyfriend got to my work a little over an hour later from the time we placed the phone order. We opened the bag only to find out they had given him the wrong order...which wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal if I wasn\u2019t pescatarian and all the sandwiches were of course meat :( So he had to walk back and let them know in which they remade our correct order and the manager was very apologetic and gave him a card for a free sandwich. I really like their shrimp avocado toast so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back. I just hope they can figure out a better system for orders.",
