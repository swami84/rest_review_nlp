The fragrant aroma of moist wings smothered in bold mesquite textures immediately hit you once inside, but it's the decorative bite-sized cakes which stole our hearts.  Cake N Wings is well-liked and the friendly atmosphere genuinely displays why Foxhurst is becoming home to the new \"mom & pop shop\" where customers and proprietors speak on a first name basis.  It's one of the reasons why Jazzy Underground visionary Troy Luqman Ali has spent countless hours preparing for a stellar launch in the local area.  Thanks to Katrina & Shari's passionate ingenuity, we at Jazzy Underground can't wait to host collaborative pairings with a widely respected name among local sweet eats!",
