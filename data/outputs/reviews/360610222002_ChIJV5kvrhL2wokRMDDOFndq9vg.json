On our last day in the city we decided to go back to Harlem and do some shopping and enjoy an outdoor concert. It was here where I smelled the most wonderful aroma of fried fish and decided to patronize this business. The wait was over 20 mins which was expected because of how many people were in line. But what wasn't expected was to be cursed out for getting ketchup and  hot sauce for food that I purchased from the business and was readily available and offered to me when I got my food. I was called everything but a child of God by the chef and threatened to have my hand chopped off because she \"didn't know what I was reaching for\". I have read the reviews and heard that she has such a beautiful soul, I just wish I had met that part of her that day. Her gift of cooking is undeniable but you can lose everything because of character flaws.",
