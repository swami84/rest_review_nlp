It was a high ceiling, well lit, beautifully decorated restaurant. I highly recommend their Ma-La Cold Noodles - the noodles were chewy and soft, the sauce slightly tangy, sweet and spicy. The ox tongue and tripe was a close second - the flavor profile was similar to the cold noodles, but I got a lot more of the szechuan pepper's famous tingliness throughout my mouth. Service was quick and friendly, prices were fair, and portions were satisfying. I'm definitely coming back - without my dog next time!",
