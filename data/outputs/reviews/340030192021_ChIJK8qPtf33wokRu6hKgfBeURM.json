I loved the seat arrangements, color of the furniture including the cute Polaroid wall, and the beautiful menus. It's bright and CLEAN in here! I can tell the staff do a great job in sanitizing and cleaning often. I was able to easily order online to take out lunch. The guys at the register were super friendly and welcoming. Food was delicious, I had the El Toro bowl with shrimp. The portion was huge and I was able to eat leftovers the next day. The ingredients were fresh and the shrimp was grilled to perfection. For spicy lovers, add a little bit of hot sauce or sriracha. I also had the Sophisticated Veggie Sammie. Yum! I didn't add any protein because I wanted a simple fresh mozz tomato zucchini sandwich. It was drizzled with olive oil and crushed pepper. The bread was delicious and I enjoyed it! They have a fridge with lots of different health drinks, my favorite is KOMBUCHA teas. I'll definitely be coming back for more. They have daily specials and a Instagram account where they update posts everyday. Have lunch here or dinner and not feel guilty, eat healthy and delicious food! You won't regret it, come see for yourself! 10/10 :)",
