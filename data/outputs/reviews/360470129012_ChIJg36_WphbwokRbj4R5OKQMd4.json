The staff were immediately attentive and welcoming and accommodating to no end!  We moved seats once, and asked for two windows and the door to be closed because it started to cool down quite a bit. (ie it was chilly af!) Maybe we were lucky but the place wasn't crowded at all so we were happy to sit inside as well.  Now the food! We had a bottle of wine, Donna Laura Chianti '15 was rather nice and we both got some salads and mains a pizza and tagliatelle bolognese!  We stayed and chatted until they closed up shop and we weren't rushed out once. In short, lovely people, tasty food, great feel around.",

The pizza is always delicious and the service is very friendly. Everyone we have brought here loves it. My only piece of feedback is that it can be noisy and hard to hear sometimes - Perhaps something the owner might want to be mindful of when it's winter, all the windows are closed, the music is loud and there is no fabric to absorb noise. (I am, however, more conscious of this because I'm hard of hearing and struggle with background noise)",

A few drinks beyond wine and beer with pizza makes all the difference.  \u2022 The place is hot in the summer. No a/c that I\u2019ve ever seen. There\u2019s a lot of wood and it heats up. Make it more comfortable for the people eating hot pizza.  \u2022 The service is slow. Often, asking for the check is an affair that can take 20 minutes. When there\u2019s no a/c, well that\u2019s really annoying.  The pizza is good. The location is good. The people are nice. These are things that are easily fixable and hopefully some helpful suggestions get them to 4 or 5 stars.",

We waited 15 mins in the cold just to find out that one (and possible more) table was free. We were three, we get two semiclean dishes. We had to went to the bar to ask for Water, glasses, an extra plate, glasses for our beers, etc etc. I can\u2019t remember how many times we had to go and ask for things that were missing. We order three appetizers and two pizzas, the arancini were the worst I ever had, the frito misto was pure sadness, the crostini were way too toasted, I mean, pure disappointment. The pizzas were ok but cold.  Clearly the two waiters were too busy and occupied with the big table, I guess big table big tip?  The rest of the tables were all complaining, three times we got the food that intended for the next table, we ended up delivering it ourselves.  I feel for this restaurant, the first time we went it was great, yesterday was terrible. We are not coming back.",

Oddly enough, for such a small space Pizza Secret had enough staff, but people didn't seem to divide up responsibilities so they were all over the place doing everything frantically. This led to nobody managing the surge of people coming in for dinner (with reservations) before a show at the nearby Barclays Center, and with the cold outside they were crowding well into the middle of the restaurant. They clearly shouldn't have accepted any reservations that night since they couldn't manage their tables. In addition, their table layout is nonsensical: group tables should be along the wall, and tables of two should be in the middle of the space. By having 2 tables of two merely inches apart from each other stacked along the wall, the staff constantly had to reach over people dining. My recommendation would be to limit reservations during the prime hours before Barclays events to better manage expectations.",

Rosario, the owner, is from Naples and comes from a family of pizza-makers (his family owns Pizzeria Miracoli in Naples) and it definitely shows in the food that he makes.  The dough is especially amazing. My favorites on the menu are the Bufalina and the Americana (which has pepperoni and an awesome spicy honey oil).",
