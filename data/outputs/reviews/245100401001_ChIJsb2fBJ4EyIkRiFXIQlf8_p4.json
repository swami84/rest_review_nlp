The skillet was really delicious. Had to spice it up with some salt & pepper because the grits were bland, but after that the dish was a 5 \u2b50\ufe0f. The scrambled eggs were the best scrambled eggs I\u2019ve had thus far. Chicken was well seasoned and fried crispy with the chicken & waffles and the blueberry pancakes were something delicious. Will definitely have to return to explore more of the menu options. Follow other reviews @ IG: eat_n_critique.",

I asked for a breakfast sandwich (craft sandwich). I even pointed at the menu. After waiting a long time, they gave me the wrong sandwich. I get that everyone makes mistakes. I wasn\u2019t even upset about that. I was upset that they didn\u2019t even apologize or take responsibility  for the error. The manager did suggest they could make the correct sandwich. But I was disgusted by the service and how the situation was handled. I told them politely I was going to leave and the manager didn\u2019t even care. I found the friendly waitress that I had yesterday  and explained the situation. She apologized on their behalf, and I felt bad that she had to do that. I don\u2019t understand how that white trash manager even became a manager. An incredibly disgusting person and a disgrace! I\u2019m not returning and I hope that white trash manager gets fired!",

I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were a Black Owned Business and excited to spend my coins there. Very rustic and eclectic vibe, we were seated downstairs and our waiter came to take our drink orders. I ordered a coffee and everyone else got juice. I was told that the coffee  was still brewing but would be ready shortly. Another party was seated and to my surprise was served coffee right away and I was still without my coffee. My husband had to go remind them to bring me my coffee. Coffee arrived and was basically colored hot water.  I ordered the breakfast skillet and that was quite tasty but lacked salt. The grits were a no go. And my husband and son's orange juice refill was sour. Service was mediocre at best and the food didn't make up for it. I do not recommend",

We pointed out the empty table and he responded with \"oh, I guess I'll have to check then .\" Well YEAH, PRETTY SURE THATS YOUR JOB. We spilled coffee on the table due to the unstable table (waiter made minimal effort to fix the table), we let the server know and it took them 15 minutes to come out and clean so we just moved tables. How is this place still open? Given the name is Saturday morning cafe, it is currently a Saturday morning here as we sit here. The least they can do is have decent service on Saturday mornings, pretty sure that's not a lot to ask for.  Finally got the food and it's so frustrating because it was decent. If you come, make sure you eat a full meal before because by the time you get your food you will be starving again and a year older.",

My dad had to walk in and say something twice for someone to come out and clean. Our waiter was kind of off, he didn\u2019t seem fully there when it came to our orders. The food was delayed by over an hour. My food came first but there was no utensils. We asked for them but my dad had to go in and get them. The rest of the food was delayed to the point that the chef had to come out and take our orders due to our waiter losing the ticket. The flavors are good but it\u2019s just very unorganized.

We placed our entire order quickly after sitting down, then waited 15 minutes for our drinks to be served. Then another 30 minutes later, our food finally arrived, and it wasn't even hot. If it's prepared to order and served promptly, it should be more than lukewarm. The place isn't that large so it doesn't seem like it should be that hard to make and serve the food a little faster.

We almost left before being seated, because we thought the host[?] didn't realize we were even there waiting. Not long after being seated, we were ready to make our order, but our waitress came and left with our request for coffee and water before we could even tell her we were ready. She brought the coffee, but not our waters. We couldn't request the water again, because she didn't return to check on us. The coffee was burned foldgers that tasted like the uncleaned pot it was probably brewed in. I ordered the Seafood Benedict, which tasted good overall, but the eggs were definitely overcooked, with no runny yolks whatsoever. The spinach and tomato (one of the things that sets it apart from the Baltimore Benedict) were on the side surprisingly. What was confusing is that my husband's Baltimore Benedict had the same. The only thing that made the orders different was the single piece of shrimp on each egg on the Seafood Benedict, and that it lacked hollandaise. But then again, my husband's Baltimore Benedict lacked the hollodaise. They also were unable to fulfill the fruit cup side that was listed on the menu. The potatoes I ordered instead were well-seasoned, and had good texture. The crab was also well-seasoned, and probably the most enjoyable part of the dish. Unfortunately though, the food was cold. It took about 25 mins for our orders to come out. Throughout our entire visit, the staff were not personable at all.",

I finished my first cup of coffee in the first 20min, but had to wait another hour till I could get a refill. The food wasn't bad, but my French toast only had mounds of whipped cream and no syrup was provided. Unfortunately it was quite dry, and the pearl like sprinkles on top made my mouth bleed slightly and caused my boyfriend to exclaim in pain. Not sure if our experience is an outlier, but as a Kansan who wasted one of my limited chances to try local food this was a total disappointment. I think the manager realized, because he took my receipt from my hand and guided us to the register, presumably to make sure we wouldn't ditch the check. They took 10% off of our $30 for 2 people tab, but as someone who would never dine and ditch it seems very derogatory. Should have paid for the first cup of coffee and gotten breakfast at the starbucks nearby.",

The meal was great, yes, but the smiling faces and welcoming attitude really made my day. I had a bumpy introduction to Baltimore, and coming in to bright smiles and kind attitudes set my day up for greatness. I really appreciate the staff, the food, and my experience in this little gem. 10/10 would visit again.",

After being seated, our food came out in 7 minutes increments AFTER we waited almost an hour and a half....an hour and a half for our breakfast. We were assured that it was coming soon which is the only reason we waited (plus the servers, Jay & Chris, were extremely helpful and friendly despite the horrible management and kitchen service). Management NEVER came to apologize or see us at all. We only came because of the yelp reviews, so it's very disappointing to see that a business you try to support would provide such horrible unprofessional service.

Everyone was very nice, but I was a little turned off by the hostess. At first she was very off-putting, like us walking into the restaurant while it was busy (although we were told it had been busy since 9:00AM and it was now 1:00PM) was a burden. After we waited for a table though, she seemed to brighten up and was very pleasant the rest of the time we were there. All of the staff were amazing, from India, to the other waitresses, to the cooks and even the runners. We were seated in the only table on the first floor and it was right behind the kitchen and also where the dishes were washed because every time the door would open is smelled horribly of syrup and dirty dish water. While India kept assuring us our food would be just a few more minutes, she actually had to come out after telling us a few times and ask what side my husband wanted, so either the fries were pre-made (they were lukewarm and soggy with oil) then I don't think the food was going to be a few more minutes. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his crab cake, but my fish was caked in grease. I don't think I'll be returning. The restaurant is cute, the area is a little hard to find (down some questionable alley ways), the service is great, but the food is sub-par.",

Immediately when I walked in I felt at home with the cafe atmosphere. We even chose to sit at the bar instead of a table because people were so friendly.  The ladies in front and the cook were incredibly welcoming, but still gave us a good couple of jabs joking around about the football rivalry. The staff was attentive to getting us drinks and recommending several of the food options. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked good, but I went with the Baltimore Benedict. It took awhile for the food to come out which is why I'm only giving 4 stars. The crab cakes weren't big, but they were good. The English muffin could have been more toasted, but it all went together nicely. The country potatoes were cooked well, but I personally would have liked more onion. My friends had eaten our free hotel breakfast, so one of them only got cheesy grits. He said they were awesome.  Next time I'm in Baltimore I would definitely come back. Convenient, unpretentious, solid food, and great staff.",

After waiting 10 minutes with no one inviting us in, while we stood outside with our family of five, three children under the age of 8, waiting in the cold, we asked when they would beat us. They told us that they had just started washing the floor, and that they would not seat us until it air dried!

One morning I decided to escape the business scene and go for brunch/breakfast. Nothing in the area looked good until I found this literal hole-in-the-wall place in a fancy alleyway. At first I was just glad to find a place to eat. But as soon as I got inside I was welcomed heartedly by a cook and what seemed to be a manager. It was nice to talk to regular people away from the convention center. I was craving some french toast because it made me think of my childhood and how my mother would brighten my morning with her home made french toast. After ordering it and taking my first bite it really brought me back. It tasted just like my mom's. I was hundreds of miles away from home but the food and staff there made me feel a bit closer.

About 10 minutes earlier, I had asked the hostess at the counter if my meal was coming up, she looked at me and said yes without checking, and then went back to playing on her smartphone. At 10 a.m. I got up and left, mentioning to the guy at the door that I had ordered half an hour earlier, and ask him if it took half an hour to make scrambled eggs.

I go upstairs and asks to speak with the manager whom comes out look past the barcode and grabs the onion off my plate and squeezes it.  I said to him so your going to overlook the barcode? I didn't order a barcode especially since I've been waiting for my food for 75 min probably more.  The manager asked me who my waiter was, i replied I don't know he never said his name.  The manager then says \"I know who you're talking about\".  The manager never looks at me, just staring at the piece of the tomato, picks it off my plate and rolls the label off in his fingers. At this point I'm just in awe that he's calm and actually have a demeanor like \"ok what you want me to do?\"  The manager asks me what I had? I say the seafood omelet.  The manager then asks \"well do you want me to make it over?\"  I said no thanks just a refund of my meal.  The manager said \"cool\" and walked away.  No apology, no emotion like this has never happened here before, no sorry for the unexplained long wait, no nothing.

After making adjustments several times, and all staff being notified no one came to look at the problem. They said they will \u201cnotify the manager\u201d who never came to to see what was leaking. Now the server was not the problem she\u2019s just the messenger. However..... we waited an hour for our food and when it finally came it was COLD! And it all came in pieces. Example... got my pancakes (which were actually pretty good in taste) but my eggs and meat didn\u2019t come for another 10 mins!! So because we once again wanted to make an adjustment, we asked for HOT syrup. Of course we were told well all the syrup was in the tables.... well clearly it\u2019s not because our syrup is empty. I kindly asked if the syrup could be warmed up in the microwave, (another adjustment) to counteract our food to make it warm. We were informed there was no microwave...after 5 mins the syrup came back... fairly warm; but at the point either the food is forcefully gone or ice cold.  It\u2019s very unfortunate that we as tourist had to go through this because we will not be returning.  And small tip; we weren\u2019t the only ones that weren\u2019t being served; we looked around the room and the entire dining area did not receive their food. Utterly RIDICULOUS!",

The morning of the race we needed a hearty breakfast since we were planning to indulge in the alcoholic beverages throughout the day. The food here was great and filling and served that purpose! The only complaint I had with the place was that the morning we were there they had run out of crab meat for their crab benedict. I was disappointed they were out but my second choice was still very good.",

She stood there trying to fan off the table with a menu. My wife had to ask for napkins to dry off the table. It took over 20 mins for our server to take our order. My wife's orange juice tasted old and she sent it back. Fast forward 1 hr. and still no food. We asked for the check to pay for the coffee I ordered so we could leave and go somewhere else. We were charged for the orange juice that my wife sent back, she didn't get a replacement. This all took place with a dead restaurant. They were sending people away telling them they were full.

Between waiting 20 min for what were actually empty tables and 20 min for drinks that never showed up and people who were mouthing to us to not bother staying and the group of 6 that got served drinks before us oh and the people telling us it's not worth it having one dish of hot food sitting on their table while 5 waited oh yeah and the waitress who was chatting it up with another table giving them local information and ignoring every other table in the place for 30 min we never got to try the food. We left and went to Starbucks around the corner.  All the reviews and review photos looked good. We arrived and were greeted by the woman attending the bar patrons. She said it would be a few min while they cleared a table downstairs. No problem.  After waiting 20 min I went downstairs and saw 3 tables. Two 4 seaters  and one 2 seat completely empty. And a waitress chatting it up with one of the tables. When I passed a waiter along the way upstairs I asked if we were waiting in the wrong spot or if we were supposed to seat ourselves. He said he'll help us in just a second.  A min or two later he seated us and asked us our drink order.  20 min later.  The waitress is still chatting with that same table. One table finally got the rest of their food. And we still don't have drinks. As we were deciding to leave or stay the table which had just gotten the rest of their food overheard us. They told us to leave and that it wasn't worth it.  It's unfortunate.  And maybe this isn't typical. But it was a complete waste of a morning for us.  Starbucks to the rescue.",
