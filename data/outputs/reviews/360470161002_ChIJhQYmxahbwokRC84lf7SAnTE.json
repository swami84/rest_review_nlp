This place definitely followed my instructions and made it the way I like it. They were very nice people. The chicken vindaloo had perfect amount of sauce and tasted delicious.  Chicken biryani was also amazing. It had saut\u00e9ed onions on bed of biryani which made it sweet yet spicy and the flavors married well together. Their rice pudding also delivered if you like sweets . Can\u2019t wait to go back there again.",

They don't have any waiters (the manager seems to answer the phone and seat people/serve/pick up tab etc). THe owner needs to decide if he/she wants to run a real eat in restaurant or not. IF yes-stop being so cheap and hire someone.. 2. There is zero atmosphere as it is mostly empty (we went at 730 pm Fri night). Presumably others have figured out that this is a take out joint and not a real place to go and enjoy a meal. Won't be back",

I asked if the food was sweet before i ordered and the waiter assured me that none of my order would be sweet as he\u2019d make sure of it. my order was chicken biryani and chicken tikka masala. Looked so good honestly but too sweet for my taste! when i told the waiter he said: no this is not sweet you have to eat it! (voice was above average level). i know what indian food is supposed to taste like and THAT wasn\u2019t even close so i respectfully told him to change it or do something and again no response and was mumbling in Urdu. so my experience was not as good as the food looked.",

This style of Indian restaurant is unique to NYC (think 6th St in the East Village) and not like the Indian places you'll find in Manhattan on Lexington in the 20s or Jackson Heights. The food is excellent, and the prices extremely reasonable. It BYOB. Best dishes include any of the curries (especially the Dansak and Vindaloo on the spicier side), the Malai Kebab, the Bengali Chicken Liver appetizer and the Mango Lassi. Plus, the Bollywood dance videos are always on. The staff is always great. Typically dessert is included, either ice cream, coconut pudding or both! Fun and delicious.",

Prospect Heights to be exact and unfamiliar territory.  We found Joy along the busy corridor of Flatbush Ave with lots of happy eaters inside so decided to give Joy a try. The casual restaurant but plain decor was an open room with tables and a small bar in the back. The restaurant was quite full and they politely asked two of the patrons if they would mind moving to a two top table for our group of six. The couple didn't have any issues and we graciously thank them. The menu had the usual selection of popular Indian selections and some that I haven't seen before therefore it is an automatic must try.  The table ordered some usual favorites and some new like Samosas to start and Chicken Tikka Masala, Gobi Bhajee, Saag Paneer and Shagoti with lamb. Samosas was crispy without being to oily. Plenty of flavor and a slight heat afterwards. The Tikka Masala was a bit sweeter than I'm use to with a tangy tomato sauce. I always enjoy the Gobi(Cauliflower). I think the standout of the dishes was the Shagoti which the table agreed was very good. It had a slight heat, the lamb was tender and not gamey. The sauce was great not only for mopping but with the rice. The portions we thought was a bit on a smallish side but was still more than adequate for the table. I think if we were a bit hungrier we'd need to add one additional dish.  I think when in the area this certainly will satisfy anyone craving Indian cuisine without taking the 5 train to the city. Joy Indian left us happy and ready for some after dinner fun in the neighborhood.",
