The menu selection has a lot of variety and even some great vegetarian options. We ordered the garlic cheese bread, wings, and two personal pizzas (one pepperoni and one Hawaiian).  My wife had been wanting a Hawaiian pizza as this was our first trip here and she loved it! But first the garlic cheese bread. It was cooked to perfection and SOOO flavorful! The right amount of cheese and the bread was so soft. I'm not usually a French bread fan because it's so easy to mess up but they nailed it! The wings came out piping hot from the oven and had some really nice seasoning. My pepperoni pizza had the pepperonis perfectly placed on the pizza so every part of it was symmetrically covered (reminded me of the movie Mannequin). The pizzas were both delicious and cooked just right! The servoce was extremely fast with our food which is saying something considering everything seems to run on \"Island time\". The lady working was so sweet and always had a smile. My wife asked for a side of ranch and she gave her 2, at no charge! All in all, the only sad part is that I wish this place was in Vegas where I live. But I'll have to come back to Hawaii just to get a good pizza from Amina's.",

I remember ordering some cheese cake for dessert which I regret for ordering too little:) They take cards and cash as well. Don\u2019t forget to tip them well. The chef/ owner/ cashier/ server/ is really really kind and never let go of a smile. Her husband also runs the place but he rarely stays on the shop because he\u2019s the one who goes to market and does the managerial tasks.

The service and friendliness of the woman who I shall call Amina is what makes this place special though. Favorite dish is the Spaghetti Rosa which has meatballs and both red and white sauces.",
