The food is SO good and tastes just like the amazing food I tried in Morocco.  If you have never tried a Chicken Bastilla (sometimes referred to as Pastilla) you need to! It's so unique. Fair warning - it is a sweet and savory dish with almonds and chicken and their version brought back all of the memories when I ate it.  Their lamb is incredible and so is the soup, but everything I've had so far has been really great! We've mostly ordered through DoorDash, so we were a bit surprised when we picked up takeout and learned they were cash only.  Cannot recommend enough!",

We ordered a few things to try them out.  *Veggie Sampler - Good, but needed some seasoning. *Bread - Not Moroccan *Harira - Authentic and best thing we had. *Bastilla - Chicken was extremely dry with made it all hard to eat because the cinnamon and sugar only dry it out more. *Chicken Casablanca Tagine - the flavor was there, but it should have been thigh or legs. The breast made it too dry.  It didn\u2019t seem too busy, but their service wasn\u2019t the best. Moroccan food is eaten with your hands and bread, so we asked for extra bread to eat the Tagine, but it took like 10 minutes to get it. My husband had to get up and ask someone else.  We were going to get the Moroccan tea, but just by looking at it, we knew it was not Moroccan. A mint leaf does not go in the tea cup.",

They have a BYOB and cash only policy at the time of this visit.  We were given a carafe of water with lemon with our menus a long with some pita bread pieces and sides if black olive slices and a red sauce.  We ordered 3 appetizers to share and 3 entrees.  One was beets & tomatoes, one shrimp in red sauce and finally shredded chicken in Philly.  Entrees were a lamb Casablanca, chicken Casablanca and a salmon with vegetables.  The starters were prepared appropriately and had good taste.  Each of us enjoyed our entrees.  The lamb was especially tender.  Since none of our 3 tangines were got and the lamb was a shank which was larger than the tagine, I believe the food was cooked in something different then placed in the tagine.  For my own taste, the spices were very underutilized and lacked robust flavoring.  We were treated to some desserts and mint tea, which was delicious.  The service is very good, attentive without being troubling.  I would certainly return and eat here again.",

We arrived at 7:30 and left at 10:00 - not because we wanted to. Took 60 mins to place our entree order. \"I'll be back,\" was the response when we BEGGED our server to place our dinner selection.  Food was pretty good, but I don't know who authentic it is. My wife is Persian, and it's like the same meals we regularly eat - albeit couscous rather than basmati rice.  (It's 4000 mile from Casablanca to Tehran. So, I think \"Moroccan\" at Shokran may be short for \"Middle Eastern.\")  BYOB is good. Cash only is good because you can tip the server less; but probably more than they deserve. I have definitely put Shokran on my DNR (\"Do Not Return\") list.",

After a quick glance at the menu and all the positive reviews online I knew we would be alright. The atmosphere was very cozy and casual. It would be a good spot for both a romantic evening with a loved one or hosting a large get together. The food is fantastic and portion sizes are extremely generous (I will be eating some of my GF's Lamb for lunch today) and you definitely get a lot for your money. I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. Next time we may just get one entree to share (we both filled up with Pita/Hummus and Bastilla as appetizers). Make sure you have cash as their is no ATM on site (Walgreen's next door has an ATM) and they are \"cash only\". They are BYOB so we also enjoyed some wine we brought with us. No corking fee. So happy to have a \"spot\" in my neighborhood. I will definitely continue to bring my friends and family here!",

The waiter asked how everything tasted, and I said mine was a bit dry and bland, and he went on a tirade about how I didn\u2019t understand authentic Moroccan food. This waiter even brought other customers into the conversation. This exchange went on for some time. He then snatched my plate and the plate of my partner who was still eating. There was no apology, but he did take it off the bill, which I appreciated as the single entree was $18. I then heard him stomping around the restaurant like a child throwing a tantrum.

But the problem is that, they take only cash !! It was not an issue for us that day, but it\u2019s a big deal usually ! Also, they charged huge gratuity even we went in a group of three!

I watched others around me getting their meals and sadly felt I was being punished for the fact that my entire party didn't attend.  Sigh. I will never return. I paid for the food, took it home and didn't even want it. The people who did appear did the same. In business, things happen. I've been in business for 25 years and telling a new customer off because you're frustrated is untenable.

The ambiance was great and the service was wonderful; the waiter took the time to explain several dishes to my friends and gave a bit of history relating to their origins in Morocco as well. We tried four dishes in all and every one of them was authentic and loaded with fresh vegetables and savory tender meats; the flavors were amazing!  The hummus was the best i have ever had, of course, it too was homemade and fresh!  Shokran is a unique Chicago experience and should be on your \"gotta try\" list if you love uniquely delicious dishes. Since it is a BYO restaurant we also saved over $56 which more than covered the cost of all our dinners!!!",
