Mussels were just okay. Potatoes came out 15 minutes before everything else. Really disappointing. The server was very nice but the bartender got my friend's drink wrong twice.

        "caption": "When I was in the process of moving back into Bensonhurst, I was looking for quick and cheap eats.  I would come in for lunch and order the 3-part dish: 2 meats and a fried egg on rice.  After a few variations of this, switching from pork to duck to chicken, my brother noticed the \"lobster special.\"  Have you ever gone into a 'Japanese' restaurant and ordered the $1 sushi and wondered why it was so cheap?  Except when it arrived, the fish tasted decent and your worries floated away?  Well, when I saw my lobsters, I immediately knew why they were so inexpensive: anorexia that tasted like nothing.  NOTHING.  It's pretty hard for a food item to have no taste and yet they've managed to accomplish just that.  On top of that, it looked shriveled- like the big bug from Starship Troopers had gotten to it.  I don't really care how cheap it cost; it'll never be worth it.  Around 4 or 5, you'll always find a takeout line going out the door for their meats.  It's really astonishing to me that no other business along 86th street has rivaled this travesty.  The day before Chinese New Year, my mom got on this line to purchase some crispy pork with 2 bones, and some scallion oil chicken.  When she queued up, the lady asked her what she wanted and she requested her items.  But when she got to the front, a woman in front of her complained that she didn't receive the right order.  Apparently, back talk was not allowed and the manager became irate and yelled at the customer and eventually disappeared to the back.  After 20 minutes of being on line, and cracking open the lid at home expecting to see one thing, we realized they didn't give us the right part of the pig.  What the hell was the point of asking if they weren't going to deliver?  If you're looking for cheap eats, I'd stop in for the \"sam bo fan\"(three treasures rice) dish, and order the roasted pork, duck, chicken(2 of the 3) with the egg on top.  Make sure there isn't a line already waiting for the meats because they will give you the bad parts of the animal.  Hmm, that sounds odd.",

We did family style, so there was plenty of food to go around. At the end, we all left happy since we all paid less than $15 each for lots and lots of food. If you come here, you\u2019ll see that every table has a lobster dish, that\u2019s because everyone is in it on the deal. Waiters are nice since they give you good recommendations on what to have, and wait time for food is not that long. Great place to spend with friends and families.",
