I usually don\u2019t leave reviews especially a negative one but this order of oxtails and fried snapper with rice and beans with sides of cabbage and fried plantains has spurred me into action. The food lacks the authentic embodiment of Jamaican cooking. The rice was soft/mushy. The fish bland. The peppers, onions and carrots that was served with the fish was inedible because they tasted as if they were soaked in straight vinegar. The cabbage tasted as if it has been cooked over several times to the point of no return. The oxtails bland. The plantains were the only item that was not ruined. Who do they\u2019ve cooking these food and passing it on as Jamaican cooking?! Just horrible. An order of $75 + got tossed in the trash. Save yourself the hassle and money.",

I showed the hostess the emails & she called over the MC to view the emails as well. He acted like he couldn't read the emails-by then, I was ready to leave because it was becoming preposterous. Are the two locations have the same owner? Who was emailing me (Melissa & Luther A.

I also was able to meet with the general manager Luther was extremely apologetic and wanted to make sure that my order was correct. It's very rare for restaurants to go out their way to make sure that customers are happy and fix any issues. Food was great and management is awesome.",

The first thing the waiter told us that if we wanted wings it would be at least 25-40 minutes and the half chicken would be an hour and a half. This was at noon! Then I saw the table sign with descriptions of their new menu item...tacos! I was excited to try them. I was served these sad looking tacos. I asked the waiter while I directed his attention to the table sign that indicated the tacos come with pico de Gallo. He started arguing with me and in a nasty tone said that he would bring me something else. I only have a limited amount of time for lunch, so I declined his offer. I won't be going back. It's too bad since their wings are delicious, if you can wait an hour to be served. NOTE!!! We went back to Mr. Brown's today and delighted with the food and service. The pictures below show how the tacos should be like, and they were delicious!",

I had a legit rum punch with a true \u201cCaribbean pour\u201d (ok maybe more than one) and the jerk chicken dinner including peas and rice, cabbage, and plantain. It was delicious, authentic, and exactly what I hoped it would be. The service was excellent; friendly and fun and attentive. I told the owner if he wants to open a location out in Seattle where I live to please do so. :) Definitely stop in here. Oh, and their beef patty is spot on.

We sat down and decided to order and then the server told us that they are taking cash only. Which was a bit of an inconvenience since we didn\u2019t plan for it, anyway we got cash, and then once we order food it was BAD!! Like microwaved food... oxtail was cold and not authentic at all... the wings were super dry and cold, the waffle fries were the only items hot but fried in bad oil, I have had better microwaved Jamaican patty than the one that was served here. Everything is super expensive for the quality of food and service offered. When the bill came we eventually ended up using our card, and it was a different server who picked it and this time the machine seemed to have no issues at all. So we wondered if the other guy was just trying to pocket cash from us. Anyway, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place... certainly not for an authentic Jamaican. The only thing good was the music playing here. Else for food, find a different spot.",

The night we decided to visit this location (a group of 5) we stood at the front door for about 3 min before anyone decided to tell us that we can sit where ever we wanted (they weren't busy, maybe 3 tables were there). Then when we sat down, it took forever for someone to help us and when they did, it was a girl with a nasty attitude like we were bothering her or maybe she just hated her job. We didn't get everything we ordered and she just left and didn't bother telling us we would have a new waiter or anything. After a long while a guy came up and asked us if we needed anything else and then informed us that our waitress has left for the night and he would be taking care of us. I wish I remembered his name because he was the only person working that night that seemed to care about customers. We weren't planning to leave a tip for our original waitress, but he ended up getting a nice tip in the short amount of time he spent with us. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back to this location. Generally speaking the food, drinks and music at Mr. Brown's is usually pretty good, just go to the other location if you can.",

Having just returned from Jamaica a few weeks ago, this experience was way below expectation. I had heard good things about the brand so it could simply be this location. Whatever the case I won't be back. First impressions are lasting. I'm trying hard to forget this one.  Two stars only because the waiter was willing to replace my husband's rum punch with a beer.

I will say the chicken tasted really good, like you'd expect.  However, they only give you one quarter of the container of rice and peas and it was dry and too spicy to enjoy.  The cabbage also didn't have salt. The staff were really nice. The ambience is reminiscent of a jamaican restaurant and the place is clean. Other than the kola champagne I had and the chicken I won't recommend this place for anything else. I'm still mad that the beef patties wasn't home made. Smdh. And they are pricy too for no reason. If the food was tasty I wouldn't mind the price but if you want authentic jamaican cuisine go elsewhere.",

Ordered my food immediately..jerk chicken sandwich and plantains.. but it still was a delay to get my food to my table. The server apologized for the extended wait. They upgraded my sandwich meal to waffles fries. There is more bread than chicken for the sandwich and I think the American cheese they put on it ruined it. Try something else.",
