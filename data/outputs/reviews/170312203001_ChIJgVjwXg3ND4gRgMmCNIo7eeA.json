The guy behind the register seemed either high or he had literally never looked at the menu before in his life. Like first day of work status but with very slow reaction time. One guy made our sandwiches and the guy who took our order made us a cannoli. Get ready cause this is the best part. Walks to the back area and grabs the cannoli, fills it with cream and sprinkles chocolate chips on top alllll with his bare unwashed hands \ud83d\ude43 Even if we weren\u2019t in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC that is sooo nasty. We then had to correct him on the price. He didn\u2019t know the answer to any of our questions, he had to forward every question we asked to the other worker. They didn\u2019t have the table cloths which isn\u2019t that big of a deal but kinda just the cherry on top of a bad experience.",

The lady at the counter was HORRENDOUSLY RUDE! I ordered a quick meal through Uber Eats. I was excited to try their Koolaid but found out it's no longer available. I decided I would buy 3 drinks. She rang up my sodas and I pulled out my credit card. She SCREAMED - CASH ONLY?!? There were no signs that I saw. Ok though. How about you make a sale by saying \"Hey we don't accept credit cards but if you'd like place an order through Uber Eats for the items and you will be good to go.\"  Long story short - DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! Also the cannoli that I ordered was not \"piped when I ordered it\" It felt cold and sad :(  Just steer clear of this place. It's just not worth it!",

I'm on a strict diet so my options are limited while eating out, but I ended up getting an Italian beef no bread. While he was making it, he explained how he was layering all the cheese and giardinara so it's mixed well, and not just thrown in the bowl. Great guy and the beef is very tasty. Will be back and will bring my wife and kid along too",

I need to preface with the fact that they just opened last week and they're just getting going, but I'm a big fan of Bari on Grand and was a big fan of Hero's on Western until they closed.  I have to say it was a lot of bread and not a lot of meat...  If you care to compare, a 12 inch at Bari is less than the 8 inch here and it seems like Bari's is more than twice the meat and cheese for less money.  I will definitely give them another shot.  It wasn't at all bad, but I wasn't super impressed on my first impression.",

We had an Italian, Italian Deluxe, and a Egg Plant Parm... not a crumb was left. The get their bread delivered from a local bakery, so it is really good and fresh.  They had only been open for a few days and ran out of bread right after we were there, so make sure you go early... or you will have to wait while more bread gets delivered! Not sure if that is a bad thing or just means everything they sell is SUPER fresh!",
