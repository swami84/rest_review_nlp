We were 4 people celebrating a birthday (which was in the notes for the reservation AND we told the waitress) and it was like they couldn\u2019t care less. I never expect anything for free but normally a restaurant will bring a dessert out for the birthday person. When we ordered a cheesecake, they brought it out, no candles, no singing. Nothing.  Besides that, I was served the wrong steak. I ordered the Pat\u2019s Ribeye (which I always get) and was served a sirloin (I think). When I told the waitress about it, they brought it back and a manager came and apologized and said they are making a new one. Welp, they brought me the wrong one AGAIN. I was done at this point. Everyone else was finished and I lost interest by then.  For $190 dinner, I\u2019ll go elsewhere next time. Or to the Saltgrass in Laughlin.  The waitress was nice enough and agreed it was the wrong steak but still a very disappointing experience.",
