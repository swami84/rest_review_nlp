I\u2019ve had the pernil and rice with pigeon peas both times, and the stewed beans as well. My only complaint is that their packaging is flimsy if you get your food to go. I was there a few a few days ago and ordered my food to go, and the beans leaked out everywhere and i was left with dry leftovers. The stewed beans give a lot of flavor to the dish and all the juices keep the pork moist. But when it all leaks out the sides of your to go plate- I\u2019m not sure if there is anything more frustrating. The chef / cook there is just the nicest man ever. Lovely place to go.",
