However, the actual dim sum itself is not flavorful. There are far tastier options in the area.  Plus, the service is abysmal. Staff yelled at us rudely demanding tips when we asked to pay by card, as if we never went to a restaurant in the US before. Of course we know to either leave tip on the table or add to the card.  They do offer dim sum to go. It is a shame their service turns me off or I might come back once in while for the baked liu sha bao.",

Steamed King Crab with Garlic (S.P)- 5/5 They let you take a picture with it while its alive, which is pretty cool. Ours was a hefty 9 lbs, and made into a delicious dish. The shells were cut for easy eating, which more restaurants need to do.  House Special Walnut Shrimp ($20.95)- 3.5/5 This wasn't as good as other Chinese restaurants and I'm not sure why. Maybe it was the mayo sauce.",

I've been here for lunch a couple of times, and I have to say it is a sweet deal to order off their lunch specials menu.  It's $5.95 and you get a rather large entree-sized dish of various noodles and rice dishes.  If you happen to be off on a weekday, you can share a dish with two other people and still be full.  I have had the broad noodles with beef, the fried rice with crab meat, and a few dishes of dim sum.  Dim sum is rather limited on weekdays so there wasn't much to choose from.  We ordered the pork spare ribs and shrimp rice noodle.  The pork spare ribs were pretty good.  You'll find that the food isn't too salty here.  I also found it to be a lot less greasy than other dim sum places.  There is truth within the other reviews: it does seem more like a place for elders to gather and chat for hours.  It's also obvious that the new owners didn't bother upgrading the interior.  I mean, what old school Chinese dim sum place is going to sport purple cafe lights and reflective mosaic tiles on the walls, and then have stapled plastic along the tables?  Couple that with an ancient looking rug and it is faced with an identity crisis.  The KTV is really one big TV on the lower level of the restaurant.  They play the China version of The Voice on it; it's rather entertaining.  I will be monopolizing that mic if I find that they play English songs on it as well.  All in all, it's a decent place to share a slow-paced meal over conversation.  The food has the special wok taste and this is most definitely attributed to the chef's skill level.  To a particularly discerning eye, it might need some interior work, but if it isn't broke, why fix it?",
