        "caption": "Cafe D'Avignon is a French-styled bakery / cafe with a variety of sweet as well as savory food options.  the Cafe is tucked onto the Broome Street side of Essex Market. the space is compromised of a counter with a variety of breads, croissants, muffins, sandwiches, cookies and more. there are coffee options here for most caffeine addicts. there is a small section of coffee condiments opposite the order counter. behind the order counter, you can see where some of the items are baked on premises. it's a nice, new clean space with all carb options on full display.  what i come here for? the Kouign-amann. The Kouign-amann hails from Brittany, France and is a buttery, slightly sugary, crunchy cake with a soft inside. it basically layers of butter and sugar in croissant / cake / muffin form. this caloric indulgence is a great reason to stop by the Essex Market. price: $3.25. (it's served at room temperature at Cafe D'Davignon. however it sb be served slightly warm, so stick it in the oven at home for a few minutes.)  pastries & breads are priced higher than other places. however you can see and taste the quality.  the service is fast and efficient. it could be friendly imo. just  an observation.  drops mic cuz carbs are life",
