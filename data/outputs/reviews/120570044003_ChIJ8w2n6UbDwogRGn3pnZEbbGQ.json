Only thing remotely close was a fish taco we had in Sayulita years ago from a ladys garage food stand!! Margaritas were excellent as well. This is all aside from the stellar murals Catrina painted herself and other fun Mexican decor and music in a 100 yo renovated bank!! Beautiful place - go and do yourself a favor and pop in !!

Everything on the Al Pastor was great, including the fresh cut pineapple, onions and cilantro. The Barbacoa was the leanest I've ever had, and was delicious. If you're from the 505 and in search of good authentic tacos for a good price be sure to check them out. Only place north of the border I can think of that rivals their Al Pastor is El Paisa on Bridge Blvd in ABQ. Will definitely be heading back for Taco Tuesdays in the future.",

I waked in and this place was completely empty, all the servers were all behind the main bar and told me I could sit anywhere so I sat at the bar to the right side. It took over 10 min for someone to come and greet me and get my drink order, even though all the servers behind the bar saw me sit down and knew I was there. After someone finally came to get my drink order, it took forever for these drinks to be made, I looked back at the main bar and all the servers were talking and hanging out and no one was making them. Finally after the drinks got there she finally brought chips and salsa, and on top of that the server never bothered to bring us water. I ordered stuffed peppers with cheese and it was very bland no taste and not worth what they were charging. The drinks was the only good thing about this place everything else is garbage, the staff, the service and the food, and it's over priced for the quality and service they are offering.

I'm okay with that but when other tables around me got there after me and getting food before me makes think that my server just didn't ring my food in. Also having to wait 40/60 mins for food and drinks while your server goes outside to take a selfie with some girls is unacceptable. The server offered to comp some appetizers or desserts for the delay in food. When we would order something they would be out of it. Our server said this delay was because they were busy but they only had 4 tables and 3 servers. I would recommend going to green lemon or Miguel's if you're looking for good Mexican in south Tampa.",

Delicious.  Sure there are a lot of other things that are excellent but there is nothing more scrumptious than lobster tacos on their menu.",

        "caption": "\"One of the worse dining experiences ever...\" Granted, the food is good. But, they need to take stock on delivering a much better customer experience. I was part of a party of 4, in which we were charged a $10 cover charge each to dine. I asked the reasoning behind this cover charge and was told by several staff members it was due to Gasparilla & minimizing patrons from using their bathrooms... \"Ok\"... Then, to top things off, I was overly/excessively charged for having an order of chips & salsa, an order of chicken tacos, 3 rounds of beers (totaling 9 beers), & a round of tequila (totaling 4). Amount charged was over $200.00 - This was just my bill. But go figure, as I was complaining about the bill to the waitor, I mentioned that one must have an accounting mindset when coming to this particular establishment. To his response (the waitor), he looks at me & says, \"Well, I'm a banker during the day\". Enough said at this point...... Bottom line.... If throwing away your hard earned money is no object, & you don't mind poor customer service, this is definitely the establishment you need to consider. Otherwise, for the total amount my party spent for this experience, I would highly suggest other alternatives. I am just left to say \"NO BUENO\"......",

        "caption": "I've been a regular at Catrinas since just after they opened, and everything I've had there has always been wonderful.  I'm predominantly vegetarian, although I do eat seafood now and then, so their menu is perfectly suited to me.  On my first visit (just after getting the coldest beer I've ever had in Florida), we ordered the Guacamole Catrinas, at the suggestion of Karol, one of the owners, who was tending the bar that afternoon.  Loaded with fresh avocado, all the right ingredients, plus fresh shrimp & lobster (real lobster!) it was perfection in a molcajete, and I knew I was hooked!  Just after our guacamole, chef Tisbeth, the other owner, came out from the kitchen.  After a great chat about her food, food in general, and the great artwork on the walls (artwork, by the way, created by Tisbeth), we went on our way, already planning our next visit.  I've tried many of the items on the menu since then, and have never been disappointed.  From awesome tamales, to a seafood mole blanco enchiladas, chiles relleno, and some of the best ceviches I've ever had (the conch ceviche on special one night gave me one of the wildest, most fun hot pepper experiences I've ever had), I'm always impatient to go back for more (and I live 45 miles away).  Food intensity ranges from delicately mild to spicily wild, the d\u00e9cor is eclectic, unique, and inviting, the staff is great, and Karol & Tisbeth treat you like a family member, not a number.  The recent addition of Mexican craft beers and a full liquor bar have made a great place even better, as there will be top shelf tequilas available that match the quality of the food and atmosphere.  If you haven't been to Catrinas..... GO. GO NOW.  AND GO HUNGRY!",
