The broth was tasty and authentic but we were little disappointed that our broth was the same. The portion of each pot was enough to share and there was a wide variety of ingredients.  Their service was attentive and friendly. The staff introduced what they served and which one is the most popular in details. They also actively added broth when needed.

The Taiwanese hot pot trend has yet to secure a footing in this town. Pot Pa Hot Pot opened in Flushing early in 2018 but barely survived a full year.  Tasty Pot, with its own success elsewhere and a city that must be near peak Taiwanese exposure, will try to settle in. On a strip populated with other large eateries and KTV spots, the warming individual cauldrons await.  At the top of the hot pot options are Taiwanese flavors such as stinky tofu and Taiwanese supreme spicy, but the first offering of beef hot soup ($13.99) is a great place to start.  The rich soup can be heated up from zero to four peppers, known as \"flaming spicy,\" so feel free to go nuts. The thin slices of beef do not get overcooked too quickly, showing that quality is pretty good for the price point.",

        "caption": "Came here for their grand opening! They offer 20% off promotion for whole month. I was going to order stinking tofu hot pot. But they sold out. So we got beef hot soup and Sichuan hot soup instead.  Beef hot soup: soup base was really good. Had taiwan satay taste. Very similar to the one I had in taiwan. The ingredient was decent. I like the fried tofu skin and taro.  Sichuan hot soup: for me was too spicy. The meat slice goes well with the soup. If you like spicy , you should enjoy this one. And the ingredient was very similar to the other pot.  Besides the hot pot. I got half half milk tea. It was milk tea with bubble and pudding. Pretty good!  I saw the group next to us. Every ordered seafood lobster soup. It got half lobster . Looks pretty fancy. Gonna come back for this next time.",
