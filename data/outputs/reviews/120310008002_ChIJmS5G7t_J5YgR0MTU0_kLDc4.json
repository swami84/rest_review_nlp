Very good spice to the dish. We had a sample of soup I guess to pass the time which turned out to be a bit on the spicy side. .We noticed other people coughing due to the spice. We also had the salmon,which turned out not to be cooked through as ordered but the dish was good as well. I was surprised glasses on the table and silverware due to covid. I would not call that very sanitary. It took at least 40 min to get our food and it was only 3 if us. .I would suggest having another cook or extra help in the kitchen.  I definitely will not visit for dinner again it was too long a wait. Maybe lunch is faster. Your tip is already included on your bill, no problem  but if your are doing that then I think you need to have top servers which I did not see. Nothing on the menu was explained,  just not the service I would expect if my tip is included.  Also the server we had was inebriated.  If I clearly saw this in one visit, management is not aware of what's going on in there own restaurant.",

In true consumer fashion I checked the reviews as I always do before going to a new place...One of the reviews stated that the customer was in a verbal exchange with a server. Customer stated the server reminded her that she did not tip during her previous visit, and she was lucky to even be served at that point!!! It was stated that the customer requested to speak with the manager/owner and server granted request and manager/owner refused. I also read the response of the manager/owner that stated maybe their restaurant wasn't the place for them. Although taken aback by the servers behavior and the manager/owners response, I decided to take the hour trip. I made reservations ahead of time and was a bit irritated after arriving on time and the table wasn't available. After waiting a very short time we were seated. The ambiance reminded me of some of the restaurants I enjoyed back home in Brooklyn. We were greeted with a complimentary chicken soup which was quite tasty. We arrived during happy hour (which is always a treat) and ordered some very tasty cocktails. We were interested in trying various items on the menu since it was our first time. We ordered the honey jerk wings, escovich snapper ($50), and the short ribs. The food arrived in a timely fashion which was great due to neither of us had eaten prior to arrival. The wings which were accompanied with cold fries were not as good as I thought it would be. Too many flavors and too much breading. When the entree arrived, it was esthetically pleasing due to the size of the platters and food. When my plate was placed before me I was filled with disappointment. I am familiar with a more traditional escovich snapper. What I received was fish drowned in sauce (same sauce used on the wings) and smothered in okra (which I dislike) peas, and carrots. After scrapping off the okra, sauce and vegetable topping I began eating my meal. Rice and peas were not flavorful and definitely not seasoned traditionally with coconut, and spices. The cabbage on the other hand was the best part of the meal. My friend had the short ribs which were big in size (not like the picture, but not complaining) and were quite tasty. When we were finished I asked for the bill to be split. I received my portion of the bill and was surprised by the extra $12 charge. After looking closely, I realized that the extra cost was the tip. I don't recall ever having my tip added for me when less than 4 people. My friend unknowingly began to calculate the servers tip before I told her it had already been added.  ( be on the lookout.) Another disappointment for me.  Luckily the servers were very nice and accommodating. I would not recommend the fish if you're used to a more traditional style of preparation. I would recommend cocktails, maybe some appetizers, and definitely the short ribs. I did ask my friend if she would return and her response was \"I would have but after hearing about the owners response to the previous customer, maybe not.\" I convienently forgot to share the review that I read before. I knew she wouldn't have gone if I told her!",

I counted at least 15 tables that also included a good size bar area  and their staff was probably not well suited for a full house. I only saw two waitresses and maybe 2 bartenders. Needless to say, our service was really slow. Not to put the blame on our waitress because I'm sure she had her hands full,  but between each time she came to check on us and take our orders it was far too long. The food we thought was ok. I ordered the steak with potatoes and my wife the full snapper. We don't feel the value is there for what you get. Maybe the kitchen was rushed preparing our meal. Our bill was about 130 for 2 people that just simply did not feel it was worth it. If the service was better maybe the food portion could've been overlooked. Feel bad having to write a negative review.",

We called to place an order for pick up and was told by the hostess that they do not do take out on Friday and Saturday evenings. I ask if I understood her correctly and she stated that was their policy. I guess their business is so booming they do not care to offer all potential customers the option of trying their cuisine. Unfortunately, they did not need our money or business. My wife and I have been supporting as many of our local restaurants as possible during this pandemic, and this has been the first location that has stated the do not offer take out on a Friday night, being Friday is our date night. Thank you to all other restaurants that do offer take out for those of us who are just not ready to dine indoors at this time. We will continue to support you.",

We got the following:  Jerk Wings - honey glazed jerk wings. No need for any dip. The wings were cooked to perfection!  Jerk Chicken Bowl - for some reason, the taste reminded me of teriyaki but much, much better! Hubby definitely enjoyed it!  Jumbo Gumbo - generous portions of seafood and vegetables. It has some okra, tomatoes and bell pepper. I got it with grits since we already have rice from the chicken, but will definitely order with rice next time! All that sauce is best with rice! So rich yet not overwhelming! Such an excellent dish! My favorite so far!  We also get to try the homemade kimchi! I love kimchi and I just want to say I prefer Pink Salt\u2019s version! Different from the original, but very, very good!  We were the first customers but I\u2019m so glad that people started coming in after our lunch. They need our support to stay in business especially during this tumultuous time. Do visit this awesome restaurant!",

My daughter and I ordered a pizza and were given the estimated wait time of 20 minutes. We walked around and went to another store to make a purchase prior to picking up our pizza. We ordered the pizza at 1:40pm and then arrived at the restaurant at about 1:58pm. At around 2:10pm, I questioned about my pizza since it had not come out yet. The server informed me that pickup times are subject to how many people they are already serving in the restaurant. She then continued to say that I had the nerve to complain when I did not tip her the last time I came to the restaurant (for a pickup order). I asked her to repeat herself and she proceeded to say that I did not tip her last time nor this time for my order. I told her I did not know I had to tip for a pickup order and if she did not have an attitude then maybe she would have gotten tipped. Lashandra continued to argue with me and told me that people like me (basically my color) are the reason why chef\u2019s do not want to serve us. I informed her it was not professional for a server to be arguing with a customer. Her defense was that the other customers in the restaurant (mainly white and about 5 people) were not looking at her but at me since I was the fool standing there arguing with her. I then asked if I could speak with a manager. She then went to the back and continued to complain about me with the chef/manager/owner. She came back and told me the manager said he had no time to come out and talk with me. At this point, I asked for a refund. She continued to argue with me. I told her that I would pray for her and that I was in ministry. She came back at me with \u201ckeep your prayers, you false Christian. Your fake Christian mask. You are a fake minister.\u201d I corrected her and reaffirmed that I was not a minister, but I see why she is where she is at. I pointed out to her that she was acting shallow and ghetto and that I was not the person for her to be doing this to. She took about 5 minutes trying to figure out how to process my refund and, in the end, had to get the chef/manager/owner to come out and help. When he came out to help her, he did not even acknowledge me nor apologize for my situation even though he heard the whole thing. As someone with a master\u2019s degree and work in counseling and in education I was professional enough to keep my composure even when she pointed out that I was stupid in front of everyone present. Overall, she needs to realize that even if you are from the ghetto it does not mean you need to behave as if you are from the ghetto. It is a shame to experience such a situation even from a restaurant that is owned and run by people of my same color, especially Jamaican when my father\u2019s family come from the islands. If I were white, would she have stood there arguing with me as a paying customer?",

My favorite was the plantains. Overall we enjoyed the meal, each others company and a special hello visit with Chef Richard.

We ordered jerk chicken wings as an appetizer, and two varieties of $5 mojitos which were overfilled with ice and underfilled with mint. The watermelon mojito left a taste in my partner's mouth for the rest of the night. The wings were slathered in a thick, sweet, ketchup-based bbq sauce (think sweet baby ray's) and they were chewy. No jerk herbs or spices could be tasted through the thick layer of sauce. The fries served with the wings were krinkle fries from a bag which were soft and starchy, like they had been microwaved.  For dinner, I had a large beef rib ($23) which was partially overcooked and slathered with an eerily similar sauce to the wings, this time with added heat, but no more flavor than before. For two sides I chose rice and peas (dry and overcooked) and grilled plantains (quite tasty). My partner had curried shrimp, which was decent, but curiously did not contain rice. She did not have a choice of side item.  Overall, the dinner service was terrible for the price. I do not know about the lunch or breakfast, but I wouldn't recommend coming for dinner to any of my friends.",

Receptionist Marcia immediately greets patrons as they enter and makes them feel welcome from the outset. On my 1st visit I ordered the Kale Salad and unsweet tea. The salad was delicious, nutritious, and very flavorful and the tea tasted very fresh!  Hard-working Executive Chef Richard Robinson frequently emerges from the kitchen and circulates around the restaurant talking to the patrons (including me), and asks them about their experience. The atmosphere is very open and friendly and the tables are well spaced so as to provide an enjoyable dining experience. Modern and colorful artwork adorns the walls adding to the ambiance, and there is a really cool mural on the main wall leading to the kitchen.  During my 1st visit I suggested that more Vegetarian options be added to the menu, such as a quinoa veggie burger. Following up on my suggestion a Jackfruit Quinoa Burger was added to the menu. I tried it at the Grand Opening and it was delicious and slightly spicy, just perfect all around. Also I tried the onion rings and they were delectable!  I really like this restaurant, the staff and the casual ambiance! I heartily recommend Pink Salt Restaurant to anyone who is seeking a fine dining experience for breakfast or luncheon in the Southside JAX area.  Update 01/15/2020: I attended the Grand Opening of new venue located at 5111 Baymeadows Rd. and it is awesome! Very spacious with lovely wine bar, outdoor deck, and beautiful artwork everywhere. Executive Chef Richard has added many new menu items and the fusion is unique. I tried the Veggie Calzone and my friend ordered the Jerk Chicken Pizza. Both dishes were very tasteful, the dough was chewy and flavorful, and portions were huge. You must see and experience this new restaurant and the fabulous cuisine!",

It was soooooo good, so good that one of my dining partners and myself decided to place an order of the soup. Because it was apparent that the soup was prepared to be served, I asked for my serving to come out without having to wait for the rest of food. Unfortunately, my soup order was not served until after several delays of my entire table being served. The dining partner who ordered the soup also ordered a plate of the Jerk Meatballs.  They looked so good as she was thoroughly enjoying them. LoL Our other dining partner ordered a breakfast meal which she enjoyed and it looked so good as well. So good that I decided to chase down my soup with an additional order of food. Decided to get an order of the breakfast I saw her eating.  Unfortunately my server informed me that he did not put in for the additional order of food while bringing our bill. I paid for the meals all in cash and was so confused as why he would return to me, several of my dollars in quarters. WTH. Who does that??? But nevertheless, this place would get 5 stars if it weren't for poor customer service. Food is very good. The prices are along the rest of the carribean restaurants in Jacksonville but with better quality and dedication to the whole establishment and not just the food. Great tasting food!",

Was cooked perfect, tender and juicy.   They serve beer and wine too. Will be coming back for sure.  Table next to me had the jerk wings and they looked goo too!",

A menu stacked with Caribbean Fusion offerings found me scratching my head over which to order first. The dining room is large well-lit and the walls are covered with amazing artwork, plus there's a small room in the back for sitting and reading or trading books oh, I don't believe there's another restaurant like it in Jacksonville. Everything from Chef Robinson kitchen is scratch made and you can definitely tell the difference. One of the dishes that stood out in my mind was the Blue Crab soup. A smoothe broth, richly spiced,  that offered up large pieces of sweet Blue Crabmeat and yellow corn.  If you have an opportunity get over to Pink Salt, and meet the chef, his story is most inspiring.",

The tequila drunken shrimp with grits I took out on my second visit \u2013 full of subtle spices, balanced with just the right amount of zing \u2013 easily convinced my family that this is a place we will visit again .
