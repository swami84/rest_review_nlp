I paid the $200 deposit that is \u201crequired\u201d the week before the reservation. I was never told anything g more than don\u2019t bring a birthday cake or decoration but \u201cbring lots of alcohol\u201d. Being as not everyone can always make a party and people cancel last minute, only 14 people ended showing up. When I got the bill it was significantly more expensive than I had predicted. The music was blasting and the server was pushing for me to pay and so I got everyone\u2019s cash and couldn\u2019t figure out why the bill was still so high.  I ended up paying the difference and obviously had had some drinks in me so it was hard to understand. The next morning I realized that they had charged me for 18 people (what my reservation was originally for). So I was overcharged by 4 people. I called the \u201crestaurant\u201d immediately when they opened and a female worker answered and asked if I knew about the reservation policy and of course no one had told me this. She said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem then and would call back about the refund.  Of course no one called me back. The next day I called and a man answered he proceeded to yell at me and tell me it was my fault that I didn\u2019t let him know 4 people didn\u2019t show up. My question was why couldn\u2019t the server count the amount of people at my table? No response. I proceeded to get yelled at by three men on the phone and they harassed me and told me it\u2019s not their problem, they\u2019re not refunding me, and that I should ask my friends for the money I paid. I was appalled. They didn\u2019t even give me a receipt for the final bill, and I was unable to dispute the charge for it because of it. Don\u2019t go here if you want to be ripped off. This place is barely legal. No one checked IDs when we walked through the doors, the food is barely edible, the owner was passing out and stumbling from drinking too much alcohol.  If I could give negative stars I would. Once again, it was fun but would rather not be ripped off again.",

This place is Disney for adults, minus the screaming brats and cry babies. Treat yourself to following and you\u2019ll have memories for a lifetime: 9 pm dinner fri or sat It\u2019s family style so get your reservation for 8-10 of your friends/people you\u2019d love to see get smash happy and sing karaoke on the bar top of a Chinese restaurant. The owner, Jimmy locks the door at 9 so get there before and don\u2019t be late. Make about 150-220 Jell-O shots of assorted colors and liquors. You know the drill, Vodka with green and yellow, Rum with red and blue. Bring as much liquor as you\u2019d like and plenty of beers (1-2 coolers worth). The sooner you pass around the shots the sooner the madness begins. Crank up the Miley Cyrus, try a little \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d by Carly Rae Jepsen and smash hits from the 2000\u2019s. Get loose, dance on the bars, take your shirts off and get wild. This is YOUR night. You deserve it. Just about everything goes. Except for breaking plates. Don\u2019t break the plates. This isn\u2019t a Greek wedding. If you\u2019re a few people short for a reservation feel free to drop me a line. If I\u2019m in town isn\u2019t love to be a part of your special night.",
