I would strongly recommend this place if you want good soothing Italian food. If you want to save money on delivery charges. You get a better deal if you go in person",

Bonus fact: A Literri legacy family members have transitioned here to run the place!  The bruschetta, fried calamari, and caprese salad were incredible. The tomato sauce is homemade which serves as an amazing base for almost every dish there that requires it. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, both of which are made in house. I also tried their lasagna, pasta primavera, and their bolognese, all of which were so flavorful and well seasoned. Portions are substantial and you get the feeling of an old world Italian trattoria mixed with a new world American corner kitchenette right in the heart of DC.  I would recommend making a reservation because the cozy space fills up quickly. Service is extremely helpful and friendly. I recommend!",

        "caption": "Great addition to the neighborhood.  The food is very good.  Much better than the previous Italian place that occupied the space for far too long.  The marinara sauce was spectacular.  The garlic cheese bread was very good, lots of garlic and chewy cheese.  I liked the fettuccine (fresh and light) with (homemade) meatballs and my wife liked the lasagna primavera. The place is new and we hope they add some more vegetable sides to the menu, and perhaps a chocolate desert.   We were too full for desert this time, but will definitely go back.  The food at the adjoining tables looked good, especially the pesto fettuccine.  UPDATE: We went back last night.  The chicken piccata and veal parmesan were outstanding.  Service was again  great.  We were told that more vegetables are coming and available off menu.",
