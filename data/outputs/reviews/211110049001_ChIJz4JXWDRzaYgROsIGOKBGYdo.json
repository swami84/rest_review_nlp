And the freshly prepared french green beans and broccoli are crazy good as well. If you haven't eaten here you are missing out on the beat rotisserie chicken you will ever eat! First visit to Caralis. Absolutely delicious. The chicken is ridiculously tasty. My sides were the French green beans and broccoli. Both were cooked fresh to order and seasoned perfectly. A+",

We also had the chafa rice, green beans, plantains, salad and chips w guacamole and salsa. You get a few different sauces, which are all delicious, but Aji Amarillo sauce is so good that I could dip just about anything in it. So, so yummy!! There are quite a few foodies and picky eaters at my work and not one person had a complaint. Someone even said that it was the best lunch they had in a very long time...I would have to agree with that.
