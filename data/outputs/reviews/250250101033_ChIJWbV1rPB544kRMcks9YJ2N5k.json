The staff treat you like family. They're incredibly friendly, and greet you on entry every time. When I say I want takeout, I'm ushered to a table by who I believe to be the owner, handed and menu with a smile, and told to take my time. Once, I forgot that they only do card transactions over $15, and they took my card anyway! I said I would be willing to add more to the order, and the nice woman said that she doesn't want me to order something I don't need. The atmosphere is like you're eating at home, which is a nice feeling. The prices are also very reasonable! This place is simply amazing, and I love coming here.",

After thirty years, they must have had many generations of chefs come and go.  Perhaps management has changed and maybe multiple times.  I eagerly looked forward to yet another great Chinese meal.

But its in a basement and is really unwelcoming, not the cleanest, really not one of my better choices.  Takeout can at least make you pretend you didn't choose sketchy food for dinner.  The crab rangoons were great and its open late soooo I can't complain.  Would probably never willingly eat there again though.",
