First, the service I received was not bad at all, the cashier was patient even though she was very busy and seemed to be the only one working at the time. I ordered the Hokkaido Miso Ramen and got my food in a very timely manner. No, it certainly wasn't the best ramen I've had (I've had a lot) but it certainly wasn't the worst. Don't be fooled by all the angry reviews here about the bad service and poor quality. Most people rush to leave reviews if they aren't completely satisfied with their dining experience so take the 1 stars with a grain of salt. If you are in the area and really want ramen you can give this place a shot.",

There was also the issue with price.  It's $3.99 for boba tea, so I was somewhat confused why my total was $9.40 for two. They charge extra for the boba in boba tea. They charge extra for the BOBA in BOBA TEA.  Can you imagine ordering spaghetti and meatballs, only to be charged extra for the meatballs?
