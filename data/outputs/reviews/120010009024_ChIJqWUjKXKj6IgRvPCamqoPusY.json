When he handed us each drink I asked which each drink was and be mumbled again. Then when I asked again he seemed annoyed and talked louder like I\u2019m a hard of hearing person. Seems pricey then back home. But then again everything next to theme parks are.",

It's worth trying all of their options because I've yet to be disappointed. Plus the meal plan will cover a lot.",
