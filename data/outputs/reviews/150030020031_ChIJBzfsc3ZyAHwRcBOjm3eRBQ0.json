The yellow tail crudo had a chopped fish on top that was fishy and distracted from the fresh buttery flavor of the yellow tail. The edamame hummus was good, the tomahawk steak for 2 had a lot of gristle, and the masala mussels had a mediocre sauce. The cocktails were good and not too sweet.  Overall, I think this restaurant is overpriced with lackluster food.",

The restaurant is in a quieter portion of the mall where one can hear the music downstairs,  but its muted enough to enjoy conversation. We started in the front patio area that had a high ceiling and was divided from.the mall by hanging platters and crab traps, so it was both airy and private. Service was efficient yet very pleasant and personable.  We had the Skiff seafood platter, plus two cocktails: Better Mules and Gardens and (I think) the Smokey Mistress. Both were sizable and well-constructed. Delicious.  The platter included oysters, crab, lobster and shrimp, all on a bed of ice along with 5 dipping sauces. All were perfectly prepared,  and the shrimp were a standout - we ordered a few more of those. So fresh and sweet.",

I have a very restrictive diet (due to allergies, I cannot have seafood, primarily). Frequently, especially at seafood restaurants, I have to \"special order\" dishes... And sometimes, that means I have to request plates off of the kid's menu, because it is the safest option for me. This has NEVER been a problem ANYWHERE, and I have had these problems my whole life. Tonight, I was with a wedding party at Herringbone. When I went to order, I requested chicken from the kid's menu. The waiter was very rude about this, and he said he would have to \"speak to the chef because the kid's menu is for KIDS not adults.\" When he served our food, he made sure to tell me again: \"This is a one time thing. This is not an adult meal. This is for kids. We won't do this again.\"  Now, for some context. The party I was with spent over a thousand dollars (yes, $1000) on our meal for about 10 people. For the waiter to be so rude and to make a big deal about my ordering a meal that they offer -- this is beyond me.  (Also, I'd like to say that what I did end up getting was terrible.) I am contacting management as well.",

The poached eggs that came with it were the size of quail eggs.  I've been here before and really enjoyed it and the food was good this time. But I was alittle disappointed by what I got.

The atmosphere in the store is also unique, but it seems to be popular with the local people in a wonderful space, and there were also two families that had birthday parties.

Herringbone is a very delicious spin on seafood. They are most popular for their happy hour on shuck oysters. $2 per oyster and they are B grade oysters. They are small but frictions and fresh. They have a very good menu. Over all experience was great based on food. The actual service got progressively better. When we walked in the service was very poor. Hostess had taken forever to seat us and the waiter would not take our order to save his life until the the second visit to the table after being seated for 12 minutes.",

Unfortunately ours was only so, so.  Absolutely the decor is exquisite!!  Perfectly designed aesthetics.  The lighting was beautiful, beyond the fixtures, the lighting effects provide a beautiful dimly lit ambiance.  The music was nice, although the restaurant was loud and at times hard to hear the music.  The service was ok, not the best and not the worst.  The food and drinks however... unfortunately disappointing.  We googled pics of the food ahead of time and so we knew what to expect. We ordered the whole fish, pink snapper.   The review pics showed it to be standing and a beautiful color of darkish pink/salmon.  Our fish arrived laying down as though it fell over and a unexpected grayish/white color.  It was appreciated that the waitress disassembled the fish at our table.  However, more than the appearance being disappointing, was the flavor.   We expected it as described by our waitress.  Crisp and crunchy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside  Outside, yes, as described. Inside, dry and lacking of flavor and very little meat.  For $55 this plate was disappointing in presentation and flavor.  The positives were definitely the ceviche tostadas and the green lip muscles.   The drink menu  had some great  drink titles, that also read well in terms of ingredients.  However we felt these failed to wow us also.  Our meal, with tip was approximately $200.  We are not afraid to spend the money, though we expect an experience in return.   We both left disappointed.  A beautiful restaurant is only as good as it's food and beverages in the end.  But ultimately I dine to enjoy the food and beverages.",

For Happy hour, it will be a bar or a high table. The store is spacious and open and relaxing. Beer $ 5, wine $ 6, cocktail $ 7. The highlight of the food is oyster. One $ 2. It is cheap in Waikiki. The stock seems to change every time, but today's small size, but the taste is sweet and delicious. We ate six by one. Recommended: Brussels & Nuts $ 6.

The combination of different d\u00e9cor styles using a drift wood look, tropical plants, other coastal living accents was very well incorporated in the restaurant.  Service was very friendly and sincere from the start and all the way to the finish. Everyone working seemed genuine and happy to be there as well as egger to please. Our server was very attentive and was always checking to see if everything was okay, although she seemed to always ask how we were doing at the moment we had food in our mouths, but that is everywhere I guess.  LOL  The oysters were very tasty, but I think the person doing the shucking needs a bit more instructions on how to do it a bit more cleanly.  I kept getting oyster shells in my bites, but it was forgiven with the quality and flavor of the oysters.  The Smoked Trout Caesar was excellent.  Ordered it as a split to share.  It was the perfect cleanse after the oysters to the main course. Ordered two mains.  The Hokkaido Scallops were excellent.  Tasty and cooked to perfection.  Great flavor and tenderness.  Only disappointment was they looked like they were plated like an appetizer. Would have liked a bit more of the bamboo rice that they were bedded on.  For the Tomahawk Porkchop, that was the big disappointment. It was a very sad looking, little bone-in porkchop that I could have gotten at any grocery store and not really of any notable flavor or outstanding quality. I would pass at $38.  The Mango Beer was a tasty delight for a lighter beer that went well with the meal through the desert.  Not heavy or to light. Flavors most would like.  It is located in the International Market Place 3rd floor, so the majority of the customers were tourists.  That being said, we noticed more children then normal.  There were some fussy ones, but being a fairly open restaurant, the crying and squawking tolerable for the most part.  One big regret was that after we were finished, we saw someone ordered the whole fish at the table next to us.  It was beautiful.  That would have been a winner for us.  So that being said, we will be back to try the dish we missed.",

Moved over to the dining area and our server suggested doing a family style dinner by picking four or five things from the menu and share, which we did. We started with the Yellowtail Crudo, which melted in your mouth. Then had the Mari's Herb Salad. For our third plate we ordered the Garlic Shrimp & Grits. Usually the wife doesn't care too much for prawns but absolutely loved these. Our last plate was the catch of the day. Finally desert, which was not on the menu, was the Mac Nut Bread Pudding.

I think that it is going to ruin a place that is said to be delicious if it opens in Korea. The seafood platter is expensive, and the rest is not expensive (if it's a restaurant on the waterfront in Hawaii, it's a good place). The oysters are on the platter, but if you let it in Tongyeong, you'll have to pay for expensive oysters in Hawaii. I thought there was no ... Other than buffalo octopus, which I enjoy a lot, it seems to be similar. Other menus just let me see the name and the name. If you do not platter, it will be about $ 35 including drinks and tips (tip is recommended at around 20%).  I know that it is the chinchillas of the Asian people and the Jinjuman scandalous, and it brings Japanese menu version. You can also look at it because it has English written beside it. Later, I asked the staff if I was Oishii. It is also true that Hawaiian food is the most common. It seems like you could say less salt.

It just has a feel to it that makes it a nice place for conversation and finger food.  Dinner was around 45 for the plate. Supposedly the whole fish is amazing, I went with the salmon. It was a small piece for the price and I do an amazing salmon at home so I might be a little picky.  Bar is pretty cool, and the puffers near the entrance are interesting to look at.  Kid menu is spot on for choices, with crayons to keep them busy.",

Occasionally, the staff is slow - on one visit, I sat at the bar for nearly 10 minutes and was seconds away from walking out when another patron pointed me out to the two bartenders, both of whom had walked past me multiple times without acknowledging me.  However, the other experiences I've had have made up for it.  Having moved to Oahu from Southern California, I often miss the \"Coastal\" Californian cuisine of fresh fish, farm grown vegetables...etc.  The snapper at Herringbone is superb and was prepared perfectly.  The cocktails are unique and inventive.  And the atmosphere is relaxed, chill, and soothing.  Trust me, it's well worth a visit - and the price.  Parking at the International Marketplace will be validated by the restaurant.",
