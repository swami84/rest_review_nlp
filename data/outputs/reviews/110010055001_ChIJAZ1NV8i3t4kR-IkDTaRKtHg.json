It was tastyish but... is wood fried pizza supposed to have grey soot where the fire hits it? If the service and the food was better this could be a hot spot. The ambiance is really nice.

I started with the salmon carpaccio, which, while a little heavy on the olive oil, had a lovely fresh taste and was well balanced by the chives and radish. The papperdelle with mushrooms, truffles, and parmesan was decadent and delectable. I finished the meal with the ricotta cheesecake which was very nice, but not anything that I haven't had at other nice restaurants. All in all, I had a very nice dinner and would love to return again.",

The service was very slow and uncoordinated and was done by 3 different people. My recommendation: go somewhere else!",

Unfortunately, the coffee was not very good, and was served with milk that had gone sour (there were chunks in it). Both cocktails we ordered were not particularly well made, and as a result we elected to try brunch somewhere else. The waiter was pretty rude about the whole thing, which I would have understood if the place was packed, and we were taking up a table. It was pretty empty, at 10:30 on a Sunday. That should tell you all you need to know about the quality of the brunch.",

ANOTHER ROACH appeared on the floor and almost crawled on my date's shoe, had i not told her to lift her feet up in time. It was disturbing and surprising, because Urbana is such a high-quality (and slightly expensive) restaurant with a clean appearance.  The only reason I'm not giving ONE star is because of our server, Manuel (I hope I'm spelling his name right). He killed the wall roach for us, notified the manager of the roach issue immediately, checked on us several times, and even took the drinks off our bill, while the manager simple asked us if we wanted to move tables. Manuel was super friendly, understanding and helpful to us, even before the roach incident. Awesome service! If you dare come to this restaurant, ask for him as your server. He's the best!  With that being said, I'm never setting foot in Urbana again. $32 for pasta but they have a roach problem. I know it's DC and all but... c'mon. ::smh::",

The first night was because we got in late and didn't want to venture out to find dinner. We sat at the bar for quicker service. Despite 2 people behind the bar, it still took a while, even on what looked to be a quiet night. Happy to chat to each other though....  The 2nd time was because it was raining and we had a very late lunch so just wanted something quick and easy. Took 20 minutes just to get water to the table. Looked like only one person was actually doing anything on the service side, despite 3 people standing there, watching us take our seats in the lounge.  For the prices, we expected a lot better service. Watching the staff standing around talking to each other rather than checking anyone needing service is pretty frustrating when to just want to order.  I saw 3 people go up to the bar to ask for things while we waited for our first drinks order because they where sick of waiting.  Pretty poor for what looks to be a high end restaurant.  2 stars may be generous.....",

The feeling (for dinner) was hotel restaurant, and that's never a good thing. For happy hour, this is a better bet, and generally has a better ambiance as well.",

        "caption": "After bar hopping with the graduating residents in the area, my husband and I decided to check out Urbana for a nice sit down dinner and to celebrate our move.  Although we felt a bit under-dressed upon checking in, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that Urbana was packed with families (with kids), tourists in shorts, and couples on dates - my husband and I fit just right in.  I'm not going to deny that I'm a big eater. When our waiter recommended ordering 3-4 dishes per person and we decided to go with just 5, I was ready to yelp a place nearby for second dinner. But honestly, 2 dishes per person was more than satisfying for anyone with normal appetite. In fact, my husband and I had to force ourselves to finish the delicious last plate and missed out on desserts. Let's get back on talking about the food...  Bolognese tagliatelle - a bit thicker than what I'm used to - much more like pappardelle - al dente, just the way I like my pasta, meat sauce - perfect blend of acidity and sweetness. One of my favorite dishes of the night!  Squid ink bucatini - didn't taste much of the squid ink but the pasta was very well made - again al dente and chewy. Served with a generous amount of  fresh shrimp and squid - a very light pasta dish.  Scallop - perfectly pan seared and seasoned - a little taste of heaven, definitely my fav dish of the night.  Halibut - my husband loved the fish but I found it a bit dry. I enjoyed the pillowy gnocchi in the incredible creamy sauce served with this fish much more. In addition, we were impressed by the size of this dish, can definitely be an entree alone.  Short rib - we were so stuffed by the time this was served. The red wine sauce wasn't overbearing like most places I've tried. It had the perfect amount of alcohol-y taste and sweetness. The short rib fell apart by a light stroke of the fork - the perfect amount of fat/meat ratio - literally melt in our mouth. Another heavenly dish.  Overall - very impressed by every dish we had. 5 dishes + service + tax = around $100. Not bad for such incredible tasting, presentation, and beautiful restaurant! Service was spot on (until our waiter had to take his break and we were waiting for our check - 10 mins of awkwardly looking all around for him). We will definitely return and thinking about taking my in laws here when",

Crispy skin and salsa verde were perfect complements. Service was friendly and not overbearing. A fun evening with good food, but not somewhere to impress a true foodie.",

Nice touch.  Ingredients are carefully chosen, my Diver Scallops spoke clearly of the oceanic \"mere-oire\" and the Creekstone Sirloin was cooked exactly as desired.

I am shocked at all of the negative reviews, but maybe they have changed some things in the last few months. We ate later in the evening on a weeknight. The service was perfect, the atmosphere was relaxing, and the staff was attentive and friendly but never hovered and were not pushy at all. The food was extremely flavorful and unique. We had the market pizza as an appetizer and each had a pasta dish for our entree. Everything was wonderful. As for the wine, the wine list was the largest I personally have ever seen, though I'm not much of a wine connoisseur. It was pages long. The only two things I would say were negative is the price was extremely high and the entree selection was not very big. I still would rate the overall experience very high.",
