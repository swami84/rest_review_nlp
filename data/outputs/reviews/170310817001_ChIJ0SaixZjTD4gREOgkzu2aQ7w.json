It's unique and is something I didn't realize I was missing in my life.  The first time I got the paneer tikka rice bowl through delivery and loved it. Went back for dine-in using a Groupon and got almost the same rice bowl, the samosa pav, and naan flatbread. The paneer tikka rice bowl is fantastic. The masala corn wasn't very flavorful so next time I'd just get a more crunchy topping instead. The naan flatbread I got was very similar to the rice bowl just in pizza form. Next time, would just order either the rice bowl or the flatbread instead of both. As for the samosa pav, the samosa filling was well flavored but the outside wasn't very crunchy. Overall, everything I've had on the menu so far has been pretty solid and the portion sizes are hearty. I look forward to going back to try more!  As for non-food aspects of the experience: The food was prepared quickly and the staff was very friendly. They have 3 tables for outdoor seating, hand sanitizer available, and water available upon request. Saw them wearing gloves in the restaurant and cleaning the table and chairs between guests.",

The chicken biryani  had very fragrant spices with strong notes of clover, I usually love biryani but the clover on this dish was just too much. Both dishes contained about one chicken breast quartered into 4 large chunks. There are other Indian spots in the neighborhood that have their menu mastered, I'll stick to those spots.",

Plus, I wanted to give small businesses my support.  I ordered delivery from Moti Cafe today and it was amazing! I ordered the MOMOS (steamed dumplings) and they came steaming with the sauces on the side. The Sweet Chili sauce wasn\u2019t over spiced and the lava sauce had a perfect kick to it. I also ordered the Vada Pav and it was delicious. The bun was soft and the potato patty was very filling for just one order. It was pretty spicy so if you don\u2019t like spice, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I ordered their \u201cMoti\u201d sauce on the side and it was probably one of the best sauces I\u2019ve had in awhile. It was creamy like an aioli and was SPICY. If I could buy it in a bottle I would.  I would definitely order from here again, it\u2019s a small business so do definitely give them your business!l",

I ordered a paneer Tikka flat bread and chilli garlic veg momos. The flat bread didn't seem to have fresh paneer but frozen/reheated and it become a mess with all the sauces, and momos were also reheated, so the flour wrap became a bit chewy after a while. Overall, it's good for satiating a craving but it can be done better. Both items were decent if u like spicy. For me it was a tad too much and I had to eat it three times, and finish along with some sweet cold drink.. it's right at the intersection and I believe there are delivery options. The interiors are simple and you can also get some nice Indian drinks there. The price maybe a bit higher than expected but definitely worth a trip if you are in downtown Chicago.",

Had the chicken Maggi noodles, vegetable momo, two orders of samosa, naan bites and the moticakes with bananas and caramel sauce. A lot of food for us, but we wanted to taste a variety. It was all very good! Chicken noodles were too spicy for mom...more for me! The moticakes cooled things down and we're a great finish. The selection of sauces accompanying each dish were really flavorful.  Lovely ladies took our orders and served us. Appreciated assistance packing up our leftovers. The restaurant was very clean including the restroom, which does need a coat/purse hook.",

I will start by saying the place is new and the staff was super friendly, so we'll consider coming back and I'll update the review if the experience is better.  The food was cold, I mean literally the meat was cold, the rice was cold, all the toppings were cold. Then, as far as Indian food goes, it didn't really have that authentic Indian flavor we were seeking. The rice was just normal rice and all the toppings are just very small toppings with no added flavor or anything to them. I was expecting the toppings to be actual vegetables, whole cut, not just a topping.  Essentially I ate a bowl with regular rice, dry chicken with some decent flavor, then a bunch of tiny little cut up veggies (truly a topping) and some Indian sauce.  I hope this place does well, but I think they might need to change it up a bit.",

But they told me they had a menu change and didn\u2019t sell bubble tea and instead did smoothies :( I was kind of sad but I ended up getting a matcha lemonade. When I got it I was immediately surprised because it was green! But overall, the taste was okay, but left kind of a sour aftertaste in your mouth. Plus, the green makes it kind of unappetizing. But it is a super cute little cafe and right across the street from the Felix hotel. They have teas, and wraps, and a bunch of cute little Indian street foods.  They gave us a sample of a Indian tea/coffee drink and it was boiling hot. But it tasted good, so that\u2019s a plus. We got our food about 10 minutes after we ordered it and matcha cakes are like little pancakes. You can pick any topping you want, though. They are superrrrrr cute! And they taste amazing. Definitely would recommend them. Their cups are super cute and the Moti makes cake in like a cardboard bowl. They are super cute and are dressed really nicely. They have little flags poked into them and they are super enjoyable.",

I really liked that they stuck to authentic flavors and weren't afraid to bring the spice, but the owner mentioned they have milder sauces too. He treated us to dessert which was THE perfect way to end the meal. The mini cakes were so airy and warm and gooey and delicious!

We tried a number of things from the menu: Matcha Lemonade: SO good! I love matcha lemonade in the summer, and Moti Cafe did a great job balancing the matcha and lemonade, it wasn't too bitter or too sweet, both flavors came through.  Berry Smoothie: Very refreshing, especially with the...  FRIES! : Wow they were great! My brother proclaimed that they were better than Portillo's (high praise in our family). The fries themselves were crispy and the sauce was so unique and tasty. There was definitely some heat, but nothing unmanageable and a great take on French fries.  Moticakes: Ok we ended up having two orders of Moticakes because we ate our first order so fast! Moticakes are like mini pancakes with your choice of sweet or savory toppings and they have a TON of topping options. They're a great little snack, or, if you're like me and always need a little something sweet after your meal, a great dessert option. We did an order with marshmallow fluff and chocolate chips and a second set with fresh strawberries and Nutella (sweet tooth!). Both were so fun and good!  Selfiecinno: There's a 0% chance that I spelled that right, but the picture was so cool! The Moti Cafe employee took a photo of my brother (with my dad photobombing in the background, of course).  Vibe/decor: Very cool and trendy decor, definitely modern but welcoming and has a cute feeling. I loved the little messages in the tile when you walk in--keep an eye out!  Staff: OMG they were so nice! Every employee we interacted with was friendly, happy to help and answer questions about the menu, even let me take a boomerang of filling the moticakes pan hahaha  Overall, a great experience! I'll definitely return for a full meal (followed by moticakes for dessert of course!)",
