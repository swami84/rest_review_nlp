Everything was super fresh, the flavors were vibrant and wonderfully balanced, and the portions (2 rolls) were perfect. I was lucky enough to try one of the chili chicken and one of the poblano-potato rolls - both were fantastic. Plenty of other protein and vegetarian options on the menu as well. Aditya was friendly and so excited to support us during this trying time for healthcare. I'll be ordering his meal delivery service starting next week to have a week's supply of meals from his and other small restaurants delivered. Thanks, Kaathis!",

I heard that Kaathis was a new restaurant that serves halal food and is open late on Friday nights so my husband and I decided to check it out. It\u2019s a nice mellow place among a street full of bars and pubs so it was nice having some peace and quiet. The decor inside was very modern and nice. We ordered a beef paratha roll and a paneer makhani bowl with a mango shake. The food was AMAZING! I\u2019ll admit, I was a little surprised to see that they use frozen parathas and maybe they should try making them fresh from scratch? But I normally don\u2019t like to eat South Asian food when I go out because that\u2019s something I can easily make/get at home without paying for it but their food was so flavorful and so delicious that I would definitely go back again! The combination of unique flavors they add to their items makes it so different from what you\u2019d get at you typical Indian restaurant and it\u2019s the perfect place to go for a quick bite! The owner was very kind and friendly and constantly checked up on us to ask if we needed anything else. When we went, they had a playlist of all of the classic Bollywood songs and it really made dining in more enjoyable. I was enjoying the songs so much that I didn\u2019t want to leave even after having finished my meal because it made me feel nostalgic about my childhood listening to those old songs. I would highly recommend checking out Kaathis!",

I personally know the owner and he is a phenomenal person. I got the beef and chili chicken roll which is wrapped on a paratha which is like a flatbread. The beef and chicken were seasoned perfectly but you can also ask for it to be spicy. You have been warned - if you request spicy, you will get what you asked for. They have other options as well but this I would recommend starting with the rolls. Here is a plus: the interiors of the restaurant is very cozy (I even attached a picture as proof).",
