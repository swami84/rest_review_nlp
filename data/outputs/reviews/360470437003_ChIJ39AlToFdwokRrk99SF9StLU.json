Got the samosa chaat, bhindi masala, gobi manchurian, and fresh shrimp.  All the west indian dishes were B.O.M.B. the others were just ok.  Clearly this place specializes in a specific regional cuisine, and I will definitely be ordering again.  P.S. Ordered pickup and it was FAST. Fine service--I ordered on their website for a scheduled pick up, and hardly interacted or spoke to them. They called me to verify my order and tell me my order was ready and that was about it.",

Host yelled at us and even told us it was his policy to charge us two entrees if we were eating in his restaurant and said this before we ordered which felt classist. When my partner was ordering her food he looked at me and asked \u201cWhat is she saying?\u201d She\u2019s speaks eloquently Connecticut English meanwhile he was the one with the strong accent but we still were able to communicate with him besides his rudeness. I felt he thought it was such a great time to project his insecurities. The host also yelled at my partner for taking water glasses off of the table next to us for water because she filled the glasses on our table with wine since it\u2019s BYOB and they were busy in the back prepping food. Just to put things in perspective the restaurant was empty of patrons and filled with delivery drivers. All in all I wish we left before we ordered our food to deter the horrendous service. Not worth paying to be mistreated when life is hard enough. Never ordering or visiting EVER! On my NEVER AGAIN LIST! Terrible SERVICE!!! I wish I could get a refund because it messed up my partner\u2019s evening the most because I was taking her out for dinner as a treat and that\u2019s what we get? TERRIBLE SERVICE? We did not deserve this treatment and the host did not deserve our kindness and neither our generous tip.",
