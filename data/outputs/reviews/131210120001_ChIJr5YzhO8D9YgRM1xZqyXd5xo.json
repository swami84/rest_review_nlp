You may want to Eat There, because the TOGO experience is very Sloppy (they should really get better fitted specialized hot dog containers). #iSERGthat the SLAW DOG was best to me (it would have been even better with cheese), & Pete's Original was best to Bae (who also had a Banger/Viking/& Hot Rod). I also tried Pete's Special dog with the Greek meat, I really didn't notice a difference compared to the regular meat in the chili. I ordered the onion strings as a side, but I really should have got regular fries instead because I only use the onion strings as extra hot dog topping which they were perfect for. The weirdest thing is they're loaded waffle fries because online I didn't notice they add yellow mustard to it which I thought was a cheese sauce, I think the yellow mustard should be optional on the fries, but they weren't that bad. Again that collard green coleslaw was everything they should really offer it on some of everything, the spicy kick to it was perfect and the flavor wasn't overpowering. Be prepared because the chili and most of their toppings excluding the collard green coleslaw has a sour beer/mustard-based taste to it, adding some ketchup may help. I tried their root beer float, the White ice cream taste as if it contained coconut so I wouldn't call it vanilla & really didn't enjoy it. I would still like to try their corn dog tho!",

The service was top notch and a true embodiment of southern hospitality. The interior is quaint and nicely laid out. There's an outdoor sitting area with nice large umbrellas. It was a treat to sit outside and enjoy my meal. Now to the whole reason you come here, THE FOOD.  The food is amazing. You choose a weiner and then you choose a build for the hot dog. You can also make it a combo if you want. I got the superior dog with the skyline coney build and loaded fries. The hot dog was truly one of the best, if not the best, hot dog I've ever had. The bun was nicely toasted as well as the hot dog itself. The chili was great and everything came together perfectly. I didn't even get a chance to take a picture because I just devoured it.  Anyway, come by and try it for yourself. You'll love the food and service!",
