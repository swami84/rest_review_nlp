We\u2019ve been there a number of times since Big8 opened and have brought family and friends. Best BBQ in SWFL, hands down, and best brisket I\u2019ve found since leaving Texas. Tried every meat so far and it\u2019s all top shelf, perfect smoke on everything. Everyone loved the smoker style serving cart. Great idea and no worries about getting served a cold meal. Keep up the good work.",

The ribs were so juicy and fall off the bone. Brisket and pork the same way. Light smoke ring, very juicy. Baked beans out of this world and Mac and cheese like you have never had before. Very cheesy like a pizza. This is my new goto place for BBQ. Dont tell everybody needs to be kept a locals secret. 5 plus stars. They could not have done any better. Big portions also.",

The beans were good. No fountain drinks or brewed sweet tea either. Who serves BBQ with no sweet tea?  Must be a northerner owner! It's a one-time visit for us.  If you are looking for a better bbq IMO go to Smoking Pit BBQ in North Ft Myers.  >> Replying to board member reply to my review.  Unfortunately you must be mistaken us for some other patron. The server who served us was on his first day as an employee and no manager stopped by our table to ask anything. The only people who spoke to us was the seating hostess and the waiter.  When we asked for sweet tea he said you only have bottled or soda cans. We even asked for brewed tea and he said no.  A couple of other issues noted from other tables around us. On the menu, the \"sausage brisket\" the waiter had to explain this concept numerous times when a couple was ordering the 2 meat combo. The waiter was terrible at explaining it. When their meals were brought to their table the husband said to the wife \"that's it, this place is way over priced for what you get\". Since I had already thought the same when my meal was delivered it stuck with me.  We weren't offered sauce, another drink or anything else until we were sitting there waiting for the waiter to walk by and he asked us do we want our check. I jokingly told him, no not really. And he started fiddling with the handheld machine.  Then going to pay. The waiter had a terrible time tearing off the receipt from the machine. On the receipt it has the QR code to scan...ONLY compatible with iPhones. This cuts out 60-70% of the population since iPhones are only approximately 30% of the cell phone user market. The little nuances just kept building up...  The dark black high walled dining table terrible design. Feel like you're eating in a box. Our joke was \"they\" dont want customers to see the other customers disappointment when they receive their meals.  The colors are gaudy. First impression walking in was were we at a NE fish market. It too was a turn off.  The outdoor seating would have been nice but the afternoon sun was cooking the painted black wood furniture with no shade.  Again, must be a North Easterner thought. If you have outdoor seating, you MUST have shade! And black furniture on black asphalt... come on!  You haven't actually ate lunch at noon outside on a sunny day at this location have you? Good idea, terrible execution.  I hope these insights help you out but as you know reviews can make or break a business.  Our first experience at Big 8 BBQ was not worth returning. Maybe when reviews state the place has changed for the better then we will bring our money and network but until then I wish you the best of luck.",

I will also point out that you can trust the heat level indicated on a given sauce..  When they say something is spicy hot - it is.  So many restaurants will say something is spicy and it doesn't even register.  Here the heat level matches to what they tell you on the menu.  I know I will definitely be back many times over.

I had the 3 combo..brisket, pulled chicken and ribs with the big 8 bbq beans and smoked potato salad. Everything was awesome.

My favorite is the brisket and it just melts in your mouth.  The 4 different sauces are each uniquely tasteful and you can tell the kitchen puts just as good care in preparing their sides.  My favorite is the collard greens.  Both the owners, Bill and Kevin and the bar tenders, Rach and Mel, are so friendly.  I like to sit at the bar and they make it the kind of place where it's very comfortable to go to even by yourself. Big 8 BBQ is my new \"Go To\" Place - especially when I've got visitors in from out of town.  I hope this place is around for a long time and does very well!",

I have never tasted all of the flavors I had tonight;  truly original and made from scratch. Between the brisket, Texas and Big 8 beans, garlic Mac and cheese, slaw, and potato salad (yes, I tried these all at one meal).  Aside from the delicious food, the staff was AMAZING! We sat at the bar with Mel (hey!) - she took good care of us and gave great recommendations. All the staff were wearing masks and hustling to feed all the hungry people coming through the door (and it was busy!). So happy to have this new restaurant in the Cape.",

The greens...rival what you'd find at the best soul food restaurants, tender with a touch of heat.  Makes you feel like you're at home. The 8 cheese Mac was super cheesy and the BBQ beans had almost as much meat as beans! The ribs were falling off the bone, and the brisket sausage was outstanding with a flavor unlike any other sausage. The burnt ends were delicious. The brisket was moist and has that smoke ring you look for in good BBQ.  A great staff can compliment a great meal. As first timers, they explained all the options, offered samples, and recommendations. They checked on us several times throughout our meal. We have been feeling homesick considering the food we've had here, but as long as we can make the occasional pilgrimage to Big 8, I think we'll be just fine.",

No matter how you choose to experience this delicious menu, rest assured that you will be greeted with a friendly, attentive staff who create a real down home feel inside the restaurant.

Menu prices were not the same as in-restaurant prices. There was a $7 increase. The 3 meat combo is $15 but when i couldn't place the order online (i was told the \"switch wasn't turned on\") & went directly to the restaurant, the 3 meat combo was $22. Not exactly sure why that was & no, I didn't ask. I just ordered the 2 meat combo-- which also refected a different price compared to online ordering.

You basically order directly from a cart. I thought this was going to be a little strange; but now I see its genius. You can actually look at the food before you order and ask for more of this or more of that. It is way better than ordering from a menu. After ordering way too much food, I tried the brisket sausage. It was the moistest sausage I have ever seen. I then tried the burn ends. They were amazing! All toasty on the outside but still soft on the inside with just the right amount of fat. Finally, I tried the brisket. My love for the sausage and burnt ends became a distant memory. The brisket is without a doubt the best I have had and after living in Texas for 20 years I have certainly eaten my share of brisket. It is simply fantastic. I realized that everything else was just a tease. The brisket is the main event. My wife said she couldn\u2019t eat her last rib. So, I tried a few bites. As it should, the meat pulled from the bone with just a slight hesitation but once free, was juicy, tender and flavorful. Lastly, even though I am not sure how I was able to eat it, the mac and cheese is crazy creamy and cheesy, the corn bread is fresh and the butter has just a hint of honey. After slouching down in the booth in my meat coma, the owner Kevin came by and noticed we might be needing a nap. He was genuinely nice, super interested in making sure we had a good experience.  THE BAD: Here in lies a problem with Big 8. The brisket is so good, that without taking photos, you cannot remember anything else. Yeah, it is that good. As a nitpick, the benches for the tables are a little tall. My toes could touch the ground by my heals had to dangle. The seat also needs to be a little lower to make the gap between the table and the bench taller because you are stuck in the seat after eating so much. Next, the parking is a pain. We had to park across the street and walk over. After eating so much, it is a long walk. Maybe they can use a valet service and I would not have to walk at all. Hum?  In the end, I highly recommend trying Big 8. I know I will certainly be back!",

The sides were all very good - we are picky when it comes to coleslaw, greens and baked beans. They were all so good. We also had the garlic mac and cheese. Yum! The portions were really generous. 4 sauce choices. We got the regular Kansas City, which was yummy! We didn't get the cornbread, but I would have gotten some grilled Texas Toast if it was on the menu. Would be a great addition to the menu eventually! The special little wet naps at the end was a nice touch. The place was VERY clean and orderly. So were the restrooms. The staff was very helpful, friendly, clean and wearing masks.  The tableside checkout was easy peasy. Pics were after we started eating. Look at the size of that brisket and ribs - Flintstone-ish....lol. Oh - and I lovedlovedloved the pickles and pickled onions on the plate. I'd like the onion recipe and my sister will be picking up coleslaw for Thanksgiving! They also have seating options. Outside, booths, tables and takeout.",

Have not been disappointed!  For the sides I have had the Collard Greens, 8-Cheese Mac & Cheese, Texas Beans,  and Big 8 Beans.  This place is amazing.  Tonight I had a \"Secret Menu Item\", just have to say the password to get it...\"Tornado.\"  This was INCREDIBLE!  Layers of Brisket, Mac&Cheese, Pickles, Cornbread, Pickled Onion, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Sauce.  Truly Delicious!  It is an appetizer, but the 3 of us had this, and 2 of us could not finish the dinners we purchased.  It is B I G!  The Texas BBQ Sauce has got a great Kick to it, The Memphis is my next favorite, it is nice and spicy!  I have not tried the others.  If you have not been on 47th Ave and tried this place, you got to go.  You can park in the Big John Parking lot across the street.  Amazing!",

They open at 4:00p.m. and when the food is gone I think they go home. So if there's something you want to really try, get there early. I've been in this location before it was Big 8 and they did quite a transformation. They have craft beer, plenty of places to sit inside and out.
