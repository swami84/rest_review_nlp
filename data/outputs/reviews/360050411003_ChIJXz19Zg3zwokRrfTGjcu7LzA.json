We bought about 4 sodas, 4 bags of chips and a pack for strawberry Oreos and it came to $56. Very pricey indeed. However, it\u2019s a novelty store and snacks you may not find anywhere else unless you search online for it. Some items I do believe you can find at other bodegas so just be mindful.

A more minor criticism: $30 for a bag of chips? The food is super expensive. I understand a lot of it is imported, but I assumed the store got things in bulk and could pass on some savings on shipping.  For these prices, you can just order from FYE/GBgifts/eBay. I guess if you don\u2019t have access to the internet, it\u2019s worth visiting this store.",
