I love a simple breakfast and at the moment until 10 am you can get a breakfast sandwich with a coffee for just 5 bucks and both were great! I also saw the nice woman behind the counter make an acai bowl for someone else and all the fruit was freshly hand cut so that was great to see the care into the food they serve",
