I'm not sure what kind of oil they were using but it was great because it had no after taste.  Now I love fried food but you can only eat so much of it. I thought I would have room for the chix wing (did you see the pic?) But I was too full and I could feel my coronary arteries starting to harden. There was really no respite in the menu. A little side of mac salad would have evened out my palate but all they had was green salads, tofu, fried potatoes with cream cheese sauce, and edamame.  This is the kind of place you wash down grease with beer.  The atmosphere was friendly and the chef and apprentice were nice.  FYI: Parking lot is small and shared with other businesses. Sometimes there is an attendant during the evening hours but if not then you would have to surrender to street parking which might be a bit tricky around this neighborhood",

One worker just started today. - Make RESERVATIONS especially for dinner time.  EXPERIENCE: When we arrived and they asked us if we had reservations which we didn't they said that they could seat us as long as we were finished before a certain time. We thought this was fine but after waiting 30+ minutes and our food didn't come I was starting to get worried (yes, I know how long it was because I could see from when I checked in just to make sure how long the wait was). Also a lot of the back menu was covered with stickers saying 'coming soon' over the items not yet available. They think it will be another month before the grand opening.  FOOD: Some stuff like the Mushrooms & Oysters were really good, while the Tako was okay (my wife said it had a slight fishy taste).  OVERALL: So if you have a reservation and not in a rush it's not that bad.",
