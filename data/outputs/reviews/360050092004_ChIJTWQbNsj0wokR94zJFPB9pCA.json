On my first visit to the restaurant, aside frome the male employee who always has a sour face and doesnt greet you ....I observed an employee adding water to the curry goat, explaining the lack if flavor in the order I had placed through GRUBHUB. Still, I made about 4 more visits only getting their DHAL POUREE and Tamarin Sauce. Tonight was my last visit! The owner Im assuming attempted to get a bit snippy and out of character to me a customer on private call, when I made reference to the inconsistences in pricing of one of there items. Your lack of overhead has nothing to do with me as a customer. If you payed more attention tobthe taste of your food versus the pricing of your condiments, you might have line out the door. YES ....LIKE I WAS ADVISED ...\"WHEN I GO TO BROOKLYN\"I WILL GET REAL TAMARIN SAUCE NOT SYRUP AND WATER AT $1.75 IN A DISPOSABLE KETCHUP CONTAINER.

The duck curry was not as soft and tender as it should have been. The shrimp curry fared better, but it too could have been more marinated before being infused into the curry base.  Service was friendly as it was helmed by two beautiful young ladies. The namesake proprietor,  Jenny, was engaging and had a  larger-than-life persona.

I picked up at 630pm and went home 3 blocks away. I purchased 4 It smelled weIrd in the car but that\u2019s normal because of the bag they put it in. Like most I feed my son because eating he refused to eat and I found something else to feed him and then it was my turn. From the first piece the taste was off think it might have been the curry. I took another piece and eat that by itself but it was clear the dhal filling was spoiled. The dough was fine but the filling was spoil took the next one out and it was the same across all 4. I\u2019m not as mad at the money lost but at the quality of the food. If my son had actually eat this I would have definitely report them. But reading reviews I hope this message gets to the owner and they can make the adjustments for better quality food . We strongly need a decent West Indian restaurant within our community.",
