        "caption": "Went there for my anniversary and had an awful experience.  We were denied a food menu for a half hour and, after ordering cocktails, were repeatedly pressured to order a bottle of wine - on five occasions in a half hour.  At one point, we had to literally stop the waiter from opening a bottle of wine of his choosing despite repeated refusals.  This is predatory and harassing - the waiter was arguing with us about our selections and attempting to order pricier options for us.  We were told that the main course was not enough and that we would need additional courses. We were given appetizers that we did not order, including a bottle of wine that we did not order as well.  This added $200 to our bill.  When I addressed this with the owner, he threatened to call the cops and told me to get a lawyer.  This is completely rude and unprofessional and does not reflect care about our experience or concerns.  Very unfortunate experience - it seems that the only objective is to extract as much money from the patron as possible.  Just very disappointed that an establishment like this is allowed to operate in this way, we were so uncomfortable and felt victimized - please go elsewhere and please support a different small business owner.  Also, by the way, the food was mediocre and lacking flavor.  Lobster was overcooked and chewy.  Bad all around.",

Double charges for drinks that were not ordered, a pasta tasting was brought to the table with no indication of price on menu or verbally. Thought it was a promo and ended up being $60 per person.  Supposed promo appetizers totaled $480 for our table of 8.  A Black Martini was ordered which should not come with olives but did. When the waiter was told he took his fingers and removed the olives.  Really?  A replacement drink was ordered and subsequently we were charged for both. Many of the staff were very nice but when we addressed the issues with the waiter he said that's the way it is. When leaving the restaurant the owner basically ignored our concerns and said he would simply reply to this comment. \"People in Italy would be offended if they were informed of pricing\" was his comment. Extremely disappointed. Buyer beware and double-check your bill! See attached",

Thankfully the concierge steered us toward Pelago. I have some food challenges, (gluten free, lactose free) and this chef was a genius. He made a GF pasta with truffles that melted in our mouths! The entrees were beautifully prepared as well, and we were even graced with a GF anniversary treat to top it all off. Service was friendly and gracious. We'll be back!",

I was supposed to meet two friends here for dinner. I arrived at approximately 845pm dressed in a suit and tie. The Pelago staff stopped me at the door and questioned me on what I was doing there. I told them that I was there to meet friends for dinner. The staff talked among themselves in Italian and they said they did not think a person like me would have friends eating there. Much to their surprise, I happen to speak Italian fluently. I responded in Italian and informed them that I was sure that my friends were inside. I called my friends on my cellphone and they came out and retrieved me. As I said, they need remedial training in etiquette.",

We had a few dishes: the burrata (which was our favourite), the fettuccine with truffles (when I had this dish last time here about a year ago it was much better. This time it felt like the pasta was just slightly overcooked and not as good as previous), the pompano fish (it was good) and the lamb special (this was okay). Service is always great here though and the ambiance is nice.  Not sure if I would come back again though",

For us, the wait staff were very pleasant (the female hostesses were not the nicest, however our actual waiter was great). The best pasta dish by far was the truffle fettucine which is not on the menu; it is amazing. Regarding the pricing: this is always subjective. For three of us dining the bill came to $977 before tip so there you go. That's the benchmark and you can decide if you want to dine here. We chose some great wines so most likely the bill could be smaller for most people dining here with three guests",

From the time you enter the door, you will get the message that  the service is going to be impeccable and that you are in for an incredible dining experience. The food is creative, delicious and excitingly presented. The wine list was extensive and the sommelier was extremely helpful. An extremely attentive waitstaff accomodated each person's (6 in our party) every need. Pelago compares well or exceeds almost  anyone's expectation of a 4-5 star dining extperience. But, it is, in fact, that; a high end dining experience and those are typically priced accordingly. The $$ rating is misleading.  Prepare your party to enjoy a meal that is an event. We had just rolled in from a 6 hour road trip and were staying at the Raffaello. We may not have been in the right frame of mind to fully enjoy this fantastic offering.  You need to be prepared to \"dine\" as you are not simply going out to \"eat.\" Be prepared to take advantage of, and fully enjoy, this rare culinary experience!",

        "caption": "An overpriced dissapointment.  We  visited Pelago a couple of years ago with a friend for a wonderful meal on the patio.  My husband had been suggesting that we return ever since. We made a mistake. Let's start with the insanely priced winelist.  It was hard to find fairly priced bottle and most of the offerings were $100+ going all the way up to over $1000. And while the winelist offered some intresting wines from interesting and unusual Italian regions, the wines by the glass were perfunctory, boring (Frescobaldi Pinot Grigio anyone? *Yawn*) and $16-17 per glass from a bottle bottle that sells for $14.95 at any liquor store. The menu was not seasonal at all which is my greatest dining greivance. Pelago's heavy meats, sauces and pastas would have been better served in the winter. Sadly items that must not rotate off the menu. The chef must be very lazy. There was a lone chopped tomato and mozzarella salad but the heirloom tomatoes were bland and flavorless; they were the grocery store variety not the farmer's market variety. What a pity this being August.  Another pasta dish was a sticky mess. What was touted at \"fresh tomatoes and eggplant\" really was pasta drowning in overcooked tomato sauce with bitter eggplant and stringy mozzarella cubes thrown in to create a big glob. In short nothing tasted of summer. Nothing really tasted great. Final verdict: two people, two salads, two pastas, two glasses of mediocre wine. $150. Never again.",

They have a nice sidewalk seating area, which I recommend when the weather is nice, and a stunning interior that makes wonderful use of the available space. It can be a bit loud inside, especially if there is a larger party in the dining area.  The pastas are made in-house and you can tell the difference. Perfectly cooked al dente pasta dishes paired with a very healthy wine list (it isn't that healthy to your wallet though, not that I would expect a \"bargain\" in a place like this).  if you are looking for a truly high end dining experience, but one that's a bit removed from some of the hectic tourist traffic on Michigan or bustling crowds on Randolph, you should come here.",

Our waiter was very friendly and happy to give suggestions when my husband was trying to narrow down his dinner choice. We had some nice cocktails while waiting for dinner as well as a salad that we shared. The meal was delicious! My husband had lamb and I had the gnocchi. Sure, the place is pricy, but the atmosphere and service (not to mention the spectacular food) is worth the price. This is not some place I would go all the time because of the price, but I would go for special occasions or maybe just for a nice date night.  I would recommend Pelago Ristorante for sure!",

Last night my wife and I decided to splurge a bit for Valentine's Day, and we were rewarded with a sophisticated, yet daring 5-course performance by chef Mauro Mafrici.  The theme of the evening being Valentine, each course incorporated the color red. We started with a tomato and seafood soup, wonderfully supple yet flavorful. Next came cappelletti in a bacon sauce; if you ever wondered about the canonical definition of \"al dente,\" this was it. The following dish, risotto with nduja sausage dressing, highlighted chef Mafrici's creative reinterpretation of Italian culinary tradition: risotto is very much a northern dish, whereas nduja comes from Calabria. I substituted branzuni for the default beef dish, though both proved delicious. The grand finale was rose petal panna cotta, featuring, yes, edible petals.  If you are looking for a classy excursion into the finest Italian cuisine, Pelago is the go-to place.",

The rabbit and scallop/shrimp dishes are also delicious.

The poor score for service ONLY relates to the fact that I came into town for business, was exhausted, and attempted to order a meal over the phone for take-out.  However, Pelago apparently doesn't \"do\" take-out.  Seems strange that I would try to give them a fistful of cash for a meal and they would turn it down based on the principle that you can only enjoy their food in the restaurant.  Reconsider your pretentious policy, Pelago.  You're leaving cash on the table and allowing other restaurants in the area to capitalize on your mistake.  I'm sure I can find somewhere else nearby to take my money....and now I'm happy to do so.",
