Opening recently in April or May, this wine & cheese shop has what you didn't know you needed. With a very robust selection of wines, you can get lost in the moment taking in the expertise of the owner, Maude. Extremely knowledgeable, she can guide you through her diverse world of wines. The cheese selection is much smaller by comparison, but very well curated. A delicious selection of harder to find cheeses cut off the wheel or brick the old fashioned way. The shop also offers wine tastings, and when there is cooler weather, live music in the adjacent courtyard. Stop in and tell Maude hello!",

The proprietor, Maude, keeps a great selection of wine ranging from very affordable to top end. Check out the wine tastings on Thursday nights.  $15 gets you 5-6 wines to taste with heavy pours. If you want to try some new wines frequently, I recommend the wine club.  There are a few different levels but I promise you will get your money's worth.

Loose start-time - start whenever you get there during the 2 hour window and move along at your own pace. Would have been nice to have had a written list of the wines tasted, since now I am struggling to remember the names of the my favorites. Tasting area not very big (gets crowded fast). Once done tasting, you're able to purchase glasses of wine at a discount, limited to a specific display set. One downfall: unable to purchase a charcuterie board until after tasting event ends, which loosely depends on whenever people who got there at whatever time are finished (left and got apps elsewhere).",

We selected a nice bottle of cab ordered the boat cheese. Both were great! They gave us 2 nice pieces of the cheese we couldn't eat it all with one bottle so we had to get a second one. The little garden out back was cozy and comfortable.  Good jazz was playing but not to loud. Perfect background. While we were enjoying the wine and cheese a little opossum came out and kept wandering around the plant beds. His name is Harold and he was abandoned by his mother so he is now a resident. Super cool and not afraid of people. Doesn't bother you, he just wanders around and looks cute.  When in Gainesville this will be our go to place to unwind.",

But that didn't seem to bother the other patrons. To be clear, it's not just the cheeses.  It's a fine example of \"Gainesville service,\" which isn't a shining example of the service industry. That is, if you walk over from your table and want to get another drink from the counter/vendor, there's no promises about how long that could take. One person in line doesnt mean that you can expect service anytime soon.  \"Can I just grab a ______(beer) real quick?\" \"Sir, please wait your turn.\" \"Oh, okay. Well, I've just been standing here for the better part of ten minutes while this woman deciphers the wine menu as if she forgot her glasses and is translating it from hieroglyphics and she's treating the ordering process as seriously as one would a retirement portfolio, whereas I've known what I want since I left a table of friends that I'd like to return to.\" Disgusted looks from customer service idiots.* Sheepish look from woman whose never seen a wine menu.*  I mean, if you're not asking questions or actively engaging the host for information about the menu, then it's customary to let the person behind you proceed. But here, it takes the whole 'chill vibe' well into the zone of stupid and irritating.  Food is on point, though. Very tasty. And they regularly feature solid musical duets/trios that do give it a nice atmosphere.  Neat date spot, or you're pretentious aunt from France might confuse Gainesville as a place with some culture.",

The menu also offered several wines of the day yet today the were \"out of all red wines.\" I ordered the quiche of the day and the soup of the day and the waiter replied with \"those won't be ready yet\".... mind you it was 12:15 pm.  He went back to confirm this and then completely forgot.  His explanation for being \"out\" of food and drinks was because of the volume of people they had. Ummmm ok it's the beginning of August in Gainesville... what did you expect???? We also witnessed people complain about the wait for their food and the waitress got snippy with them.  People were flagging down waiters and getting up and going to the kitchen for silverware.  We were planning on ordering food but after seeing all of this we left and went somewhere else.",

The store carries a diverse and interesting wine selection and all the other accompaniments including cheeses and crackers. There was only one person working when we came in and he helped us select our wine, 1 glass each, we picked some crackers and asked for a selection of cheeses. We were the only customers in the restaurant side and our server let us know he would be dividing his time between us and the store. Service was pleasant, the atmosphere was perfect for having a great visit with friends, the wine was excellent. The price was reasonable and we felt we got our money's worth in every way. I would recommend it.",
