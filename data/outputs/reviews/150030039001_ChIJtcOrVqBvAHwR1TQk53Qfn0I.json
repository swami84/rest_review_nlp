We asked if we could eat inside and the female was very accommodating. She brought down 2 chairs and cleaned a table for us.  The ahi sandwich was awesome. The bun was nice and soft. The ahi was seared with the inside raw. It was loaded high with alfalfa sprouts and watercress and a lightly seasoned aioli sauce. It comes with what appears to be freshly made crinkle cut potato chips.  The truffle fries were warm and crisp. They are shoestring cut with parmesan cheese and truffle oil. It comes in a paper bowl with emig fries for 2 people.  The macadamia nut cookie was well flavored and crispy.  We didn't ask, but what would be good is if you could exchange the chips for the truffle fries for a nominal fee.  The staff were very friendly. All in all I really enjoyed this place. Definitely coming back.",

The place is beautiful, the cozy atmosphere with jazz music that accompanies the delicious food. I chose the spectacular Saturday lunch tuna ahi burger. So Fresh, So Good! Portuguese soup a delight. The beetroot salad with fresh goat cheese a delight. The homemade pickles are wonderful. Everything is fresh and carefully prepared by the chef and the very friendly team. The welcome is really warm. We feel good at Hicraft and I already want to come back! For a gourmet like me I could not have asked for better.

We tried the Italian Job and The Che (my favorite so far!) along with a side of their yummy Yuzu Pickles. This place really lives up to their name as all their food is truly a craft and everything is made to order. Don't forget to ask about their daily specials too! I do feel that the prices are a little high but you get the quality, ambiance, and friendly service that all comes along with it so that makes it all worth it. I will be back to try all the different sandwiches on their menu!!",

Location is a little difficult to find, but so worth the hunt. Unbelievable craving for a sandwich? Go. Here. :)",
