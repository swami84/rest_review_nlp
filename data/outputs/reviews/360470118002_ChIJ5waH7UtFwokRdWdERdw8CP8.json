What makes it good is that their Alaskan roll is decent. Wouldnt really recommend eating here unless you're on a budget because 8 rolls only costed me 25 dollars with a average of 2 dollars per regular roll and 6 dollars per special roll. Great price but doesn't bring out the actual sushi flavors you would get in Japan.",

Our waitress never smiled, or apologized after she gave us the wrong drinks two times. We were in a hurry to get to another town and the other half of our order was taking over an hour so we called it done, and told them to just cancel the rest. They gave us our total and we ended up paying for the orders that never got brought out for us. Later they took off our tax, so our price went down by a little. I\u2019m not saying we are cheap. But if the food in a restaurant is really really good, we will be willing to pay a good amount of money. This restaurant has a decent quality service. I honestly think they were messing with us since they could tell we weren\u2019t from Brooklyn, yet only on vacation and stopping in. Also the first time that I\u2019ve ever came across a waitress losing our order ticket. If you are visiting here I recommend to not come to this place. They like to think they can trick us just because we aren\u2019t from Brooklyn.",

I went for lunch time with my brother for the advertised all you can eat lunch buffet for $13.99 and it was 3:30 so as our order was being made, I checked the time and it was 3:50 before our first sushi order came out. Let me just add that the atmosphere was awkward because the girl and the sushi chefs stares you down when you eat and judges you high-key based on the UNBELIEVABLE amount of food you ordered. This is the first time I had felt so umcomfortable at a restaurant and I try to be understanding because I am a server myself. The second order of rolls that came out later was made after 4:00 because they were hesitant on if we can finish what we ordered which was the end of the lunch buffet but keep in mind that we ordered everything before dinner buffet. As I went up to pay, the girl upfront said if you pay with cash you get $3 off but I was sure that applied only for dinner so she wanted to charge me almost $40 for the dinner buffet because the rolls were \"ordered and made\" past 4:00 but I explained nicely to her that we ordered at lunch time so she charged me a total of $25 for the lunch that I came for and said sarcastically the $3 off won't be included because it only applies for dinner buffet, girl no thank you, I much rather take the lunch that I came for. So, please watch your time when you come in to eat for their buffet and false advertisement and  your checks. Beyond dissappointed.",

We just ordered again, though, so I will update this depending if my thoughts of this place change. If I do not edit the food, assume my review and findings remain intact & accurate. The food is always delicious, the man (and sometimes woman) who answer the phone are quick, friendly, and listen well. The prices are the most fantastic part about this place, also. Prices that just can't be beat, and the amount of food they give is just perfect! My experiences ordering from here have always been a positive one! Unfortunately, I cannot speak on behalf of their in-house customer service - as we have never eaten within the establishment - but maybe one day soon I will be able to edit this review to include my perspectives of that aspect, as some of these other reviews make me quite sad! Hopefully when I go, I receive beyond excellent customer service!",

I asked for substitutions instead of the usual California roll and shumai, but they told me no substitutions because it's more work for the sushi chef. I told her that she could charge me extra and she very reluctantly agreed and said that she would only allow it this 1 time. It was not busy when I went...so, they clearly put their own convenience before their customers' needs. I guess \"\u5ba2\u6237\u5c31\u662f\u4e0a\u5e1d\" does not apply here.  Another disappointment was that they don't have the mild dark tempura sauce that most restaurants give.  The main pro about this place is that it is 50% off for takeout. This makes their takeout price nearly unbeatable.  Every time I go, I only see young sushi chefs and young cashier/waitresses. I never see the owner around. I feel like the owner should be around to manage his employees.",

The format of the buffet is free to order some common ones, perhaps the simplest to show the real skill of the sushi chef. Udon soup is sweet and sour in the mouth. It is nostalgic for Cantonese sauerkraut soup. Of course, it is not sauerkraut soup. Crab meat salad looks good. Cut the crab fillet and cucumber into thin slices. The taste is sweet and sour, which is the flavor of the salad, followed by the crispness of cucumber, and the texture of crab shreds like gluten. Only then did I feel the bitterness accumulated from cucumber, and the salad became the protagonist of this dish. For deep-fried shrimps, the shrimps are shelled and then fried in a batter. When serving, they are topped with sour plum sauce, which is crispy in the mouth, sweet and sour from the plum sauce, and then to the taste of shrimp. Perhaps this form of expression is the taste of the people in this place.
