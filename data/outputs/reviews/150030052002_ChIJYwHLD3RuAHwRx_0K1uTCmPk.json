I didn't believe the other negative reviews when I first read them and thought people were just complaining but after eating there, I do not recommend this place.",

We Ethiopians as part of our culture we share food and use our hands to eat! This restaurant doesn\u2019t provide basic conditions to have clean hands before meal. Handling a restroom key after washing hands is an issue that should be addressed. It is more disappointing that the same issues were posted three years ago and  nothing was addressed.

Thumbs up all the way.  We started off with the appetizers. And it didn't disappoint. The sambusas were golden brown and delicious. 2 pieces for  $7.50. The food here is indeed pricey and the food is served family style. Prices for food range from 19 to 25 dollars. The flavors were unique and unfamiliar though several of the dishes surprised my with it's flavors. The Ethiopian style iced tea packed a \"punch\" so to speak. Kind a like punkin pie drink.",

Our waitress left for the day before we even recieved our food. They also plated a vegetarian dish with the meat dish and refused to take it back when we had 2 vegans in our group. Will Never Dine Here Again. Top 5 worst places I've ever eaten at. Also all of there drink options were sold out. How do you sell out of tea???",

No needless to say the loss of stars is from the price and value you get here. Let me explain. We ordered the vegetarian sampler and 3 different meats. For the price you would think it came as a large sample of vegetable dishes and separate meat dishes, but no they put it all on one plate and served a table of 5. And don't get me started on how little injera bread they provide. We had to order bread 3 times to feed us. Overall after 90$ our party of 5 (3 and 2 little children ) we're not full. Overall the value just doesn't really add up here. Ethiopian should be a large meal for a good price. This is a small meal for a huge price. But sadly it's all we have on Oahu...",

We had the spicy sauteed lamb and homemade cheese and vegetarian sample platter. It was the best thing I have ever eaten in my life. The spices and the aroma are perfect.

We unfortunately selected this place to celebrate my boyfriend\u2019s graduation (he lived in Ethiopia for 17 years and we love finding Ethiopian food places in Houston where we live). All of us at the table (party of 5) agreed a 1 star rating was quite generous.  This place has a nice atmosphere. It seems to me this would be an excellent experience for a small party (2-4 people) who would like to drink wine and have an appetizer or small plate. We love supporting local Ethiopian communities, but it was a disappointment to both those familiar with Ethiopian food (myself and my boyfriend), and to three first-timers.  It was 50 minutes before we got our food. Our drinks were constantly empty.  The hot tea (Kememe Shai) we asked for never came but was on our bill. We ran out of injera and couldn\u2019t finish our meal. And this place requires, because we had a party of five, that we order five entrees, which can add up.  I\u2019ve had Ethiopian food many times; the injera here is thin and flat and does not have the traditional sponginess or sourdough flavor.  I encourage readers to try Ethiopian food in their local area and learn more about the culture. However, while in Oahu, you may be better served by visiting Rainbow Drive In. :-)",

I deducted 1 star only because the waitress brought our check when we weren\u2019t even finished and we still wanted to order desert. Then, when we ordered the peanut tea we waited 30 minutes or more and it never came! So we just left without getting to try it. I really wanted to try the tea too as it was highly reviewed. Let me note, it was not busy either so I\u2019m not sure why that happened. Service needs to be better. Otherwise the food is wonderful.",

Friends recommended that we try out their food since they'd had positive experiences in the past and the joy of sharing plates, as they had done during their last visit. We arrived for dinner and were promptly greeted by staff. We asked if we could be seated outside and our server said we could not as seating was full, offering us a booth. We sat, looked over their options and prepared to order, with each couple (four people total, two couples) choosing a entree to share. We were informed by our server that each individual was required to order an entree. We laughed, he laughed, and then he said that, while his statement sounded like a joke, it was not a joke. We looked around and saw at least four other groups seated and I can confirm that two of the other seated groups were actively sharing entrees. We again asked if he was serious, and our server stated that he was and that we could leave if we were displeased. We even confirmed with our friends about their prior experience was not a mistake. After confirming how high the prices now were per person (I'd guess around $18 per plate) we decided to eat elsewhere.  I've probably eaten at hundreds of restaurants and I've never been told that each adult was required to order a full-sized entree or leave. If that price per plate is acceptable to you and their... unusual policy is not a surprise, then... enjoy... I suppose.",

So far our experience has been amazing, leaving the restaurant always proud. However, tonight has been a big disappointment. We were eager to find an Ethiopian Restaurant in Honolulu. We were so excited when we found one online. We decided to spend our Friday night there and went. To our disappointment, the reception was cold and, weird enough, with a musical duo playing a Turkish song. The waitress knew nothing about our food. To begin with, if an Ethiopian Restaurant does not serve Kitfo, it can hardly be Ethiopian Restaurant. And to make things worse, the reason the waitress gave why they could not serve Kitfo made no sense at all. Though the name of the restaurant says \"Ethiopian Love \" it displayed no love at all. The only apparent Ethiopian guy in the place which we assumed was the owner seemed totally stoned (high) with some kind of drug. He was so high that he did not even extended us the usual Ethiopian greeting. He seemed oblivious to our presence. Anyway, the biggest disappointment was when the food we ordered arrived. Though we ordered three different dishes, the portion that was on our try would only be just one dish had it been in any other place. The price for the taste and volume was a rip off. It was a total waste of our money and most importantly our Friday evening.",

It still has its little quirks so that's the reason for four instead of five stars but the food is GREAT!  The food was good but our service  experience was not. Most notably, I asked for a coffee at the beginning of the meal and I never got it. When the check came it had the coffee that I never got on it and I had to ask them to remove it which they did with no problem. But why was it on there in the first place?",

Luckily, I was able to find metered street parking right outside the restaurant.  I only had to pay for an hour, no charge after 6pm.  There are many lots/garages in the area if street parking is full.  Everything here is meant to be eaten with your hands.  Initially I thought that eating with my hands would be messy but it actually wasn't that bad at all. Everything was easy to grab and eat with the Injera which was a spongy type of Ethiopian bread.  For our appetizer we ordered the sambussas...probably my favorite dish of the night!  We shared the Ethiopian Love Veggie Sampler and 2 meat dishes.  I was very impressed!  The food was delicious! Everything was flavored perfectly! However, the dishes are served with little injera so we had to order more on the side.",

All of your meats and veggies are resting on top of it. So they do their best to put all of your orders onto one huge dish and you get to pick and choose or mix and match anything you want to go together.  So this is a place that you have to eat with your hands and it can get a little messy at first.  But once you are hands into your meal (the chicken and lamb taste great by the way) you won't remember why you would ever eat with utensils.  Oh and the spicy things are really spicy.",

She had made reservations at a particular table in the back of the restaurant, but when we all arrived, we were told to wait in the darkened inner courtyard of the building. After about ten minutes, we asked again about our table. The server, acted as if she'd never seen us before pulled two tiny round tables at the front of the restaurant together for us to sit at, since our \"reserved\" table or any table of adequate size was unavailable. My husband was dripped on profusely by the air conditioner - We even saw workers mopping up water from the floor nearby. Finally, after another group cleared out, we were able to switch tables. The food was expensive, and the service was terrible. It was so difficult to get service. When we asked for water, we were given luke warm tap water in mismatching cups - In fact, it looked like some of the cups were glass jars that had been used as flower pots. We tried to just enjoy dinner, and the food was good when it got to us. At the end of dinner, all of us insisted on paying for the birthday girl. We were mostly able to pay in cash but not quite. We owed $5 more plus tip, so I put the balance after cash and tip on my credit card. I later discovered two charges from the restaurant on my credit card statement, one for the correct amount, and a second, $75 charge! All I can imagine is that the workers pocketed $75 in cash and charged me a second time for that - I'm disputing the charge now.  Will NEVER go back to this place. What a nightmare!",
