I had a pesto California wrap.  Hands down the best wrap in my life.  It had pesto sauce, sun dried tomatoes, shredded chicken, drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. We also a sangria. Delicious !

They sell artisinal home made items for your home hence the name hom. While the back area is the restaurant. Service was wonderful as they were very attentive and friendly. Standout dish was the corn beef hash with eggs and a biscuit. Biscuit was soft and buttery. As well as the bread basket which came with a variety of cakes and bagels. The whole meal was satisfactory but not overwhelmingly memorable. It's a great neighborhood spot though but wouldn't be a destination kind of place for me.",

        "caption": "This is one of my favorite joints for brunch- just to escape the craziness of the city.  I've been here 4 times now.  I recently bought the $19 Groupon deal which covered a brunch dish plus a glass of sangria for 2.  It's a great steal considering their usual prices on the food ($12.95) and sangria ($10) per person.  If I had written this after the last time, it would have gotten a stellar 5 stars from me.  However, on my most recent visit, I ordered the same gingerbread pancakes.  The pancakes were shrunken in size, and were placed on an oval dish instead of the usual large, round one.  Also, they were not as fluffy as I had remembered, and they tasted drier than usual.  They were not as well executed.  I had to wonder if it was because the place was packed this time around- the first few times I went, there were only 2 or 3 tables filled.  It's not a big space to begin with; the front area is a store, which sells home goods and accessories.  They are only utilizing the back space as a cafe type environment.  I'm still giving it a high score for the culmination of my experiences thus far, and to give the benefit of the doubt that the last brunch was a one-time flop.  However, I won't be returning until they change their menu; I think I might be pancaked out.",

Both were very good. I especially loved the tea which comes in a tea pot at your table. The gift store in the front is a great place to look for glittery gifts.",
