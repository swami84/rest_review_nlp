I came there at 11 am, hostess said you can go upstairs.I ordered two bibimpaps (27$), she said ok we don\u2019t serve it here, only barbecue, she was rude though. Okay, we went downstairs and ordered there. Another girl didn\u2019t care about us at all.. we wanted to seat inside (March 10), she said it\u2019s not allowed. Then why it is allowed upstairs? Didn\u2019t get that. After when she brought our food, she put on the table near her without a word. So we were wondering is this our order or someone else. In a nice places usually cashier come to you and say something like \u201cThis your order guys, have a good day, etc\u201d She said absolutely NOTHING, like we were empty place. Didn\u2019t leave any tips and will never ever visit this place again. So disappointed. I\u2019ve been to Korea several times they never give a such service to you. With bibimpab dish you get a soup and side dishes as well in Korean restaurants.",

The server served us our sides and water and cooked the meat for us (that was all she did). Besides that she never checked on us. We gave her a tip based on her service which we thought was decent, however once we already left the building she chased after us. She pointed to the bottom of the receipt and stated that we needed to tip her within the range based on her service. It was the SUGGESTED GRATUITY listed at the bottom of the receipt which had a suggested 15% gratuity of $15-$20. We saw that but tipped below that range. There were absolutely NO SIGNS anywhere in the store that said there was a requirement of 15% gratuity. Not sure if this is something new they implemented but I had no issues with tipping during my first experience there.",

For two people, our check was $110.  The host was pretty rude. We walked in and she looked at us and said, \"what would you like?\" I stated, \"Hi, we'd like to sit in for the Korean BBQ.\" And she responded with, \"Well, that's all we do.\" (In my head: then why would you ask me?!)

If you are a K-pop or specifically a BTS fan then this place is definitely for you! they had a huge sign outside welcoming Armies. They also had K-pop blasting through the squeaker inside the restaurant. The sides were REALLY good, the meat (BBQ) itself was alright.

The food was so good and the concept is super cool.  The waiter/waitress actually comes to your table and cooks the food for you. I did see a few tables cooking their own but I\u2019m lazy. Between the three of us we split a small beef combo and it was more than enough food.  Great food and great vibe. All my friends were jealous of the snaps I was sending.",

I\u2019ve been trying to open myself up lately and said yes when my friend asked me to come here.  The menu was small, which freaked me out since I didn\u2019t immediately see something I would eat.  I got the japchae because I thought noodles would be safe, and my friend got the combo beef option.   The beef came out first and wow it\u2019s a lot of food!! I had my friend explain each side and found quite a few that I really liked (potato salad, bean sprouts, onions...).  The meat was really good too, coming from someone who doesn\u2019t often eat straight up meat.  I really enjoyed the japchae, though I was thinking with the beef combo it wasn\u2019t even necessary because there was already so much food.  So happy I tried something new because I\u2019m going to be bringing others here again!  The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was because the menu was a bit limited to me and maybe for others, though I did really enjoy what I got.  5/5 for my experience and food.",

While being ushered to our tiny table with too many chairs, the hostess told us that there is an hour and a half seating time limit.  Once we got to the table and sat down, we waited another 20 minutes for the waitress to pop in and ask if we're ready to order. There was no explanation of any menu items or how to order, just a few curt comments.  When the waitress opened the grill cover, our entire table was shocked. The water reservoir was filthy and moldy.  There was continued abuse from the waitress which prompted most of our party members to walk out of the restaurant, which is a very shocking feat as we have never done that in the past.  Look, the bottom line is this:  If you're going to implement a time limit on your customers, ensure you provide prompt service. It's unfair to provide slowwwwe service and tell people you can't sit there for more than 1 1/2 hours.  Clean your restaurant, especially the tables and the grilling areas. The water reservoir was moldy and had food remnants stuck on it. The table was streaked with dry rag water.  Why would we want to spend our money being treated with disrespect and dirty eating environment? Dirty tables and restaurants are not a representation of Korean food. I should know. I am Korean.",

This is the only place around where I live that is similar to the joints there. I love the set menus, as it offers a perfect amount of food for 2-4 people. We took my friend here for her birthday because she had seen us eating Korean BBQ in NYC and really wanted to try it. Happy to say she was impressed and so were we! We ordered the beef set menu for 4. It came with egg and cheese corn and we also ordered kimchi stew for our included soup. Staff came to flip our meat and always made sure we were taken care of. They gave us extra sides for free. It's a kpop haven as they place Kpop MVs projecting on a wall and music. The place is smaller than I thought it was (it's on the upper level only) but they get people in and out fast with their service! Will definitely be coming back here!",

I am normally a fast eater so for me to feel this rushed is completely unacceptable.  The food is top notch and I have been to a lot of Korean barbecues all over the country.  I knocked off a second star because they turned off the grill before our food was completely done cooking in their attempt to get us out the door.

I\u2019m a big rice paper user when I eat Korean bbq and this place failed in that. They had us use lettuce. SMH. Over priced for what you get. Look elsewhere",

Sides were unlimited and was refilled promptly. Staff was on point and helped cook all the meat, cut it all and let us know when it was ready. We came at an off time at 3pm so there was no wait and still a few open tables. Beware, you will have to wait if you come for lunch or dinner. We attempted to come last week sat around 7pm and the wait time was 75 mins. Thanks for a great meal!! Also the best part is that all grills have a vent on top so you leave without smelling like Korean bbq!!",

They asked for a name and number and then sent a confirmation text message. Super simple easy and idiot friendly!!  When we arrive our server Ian was friendly and personabe. He sat our group and took orders as we were ready. He also offered to explain how the ordering worked. Later he even helped us pronounce the bean paste. It was awesome. Ian also provided great entertainment t my friends and myself. His friendly attitude and well timed jokes made us roll with laughter and feel at ease the entire time.  Over all. Food was delicious. Serivce was spectacular. Experience was just as excellent.  I highly recommend anyone traveling and wanting to experience a more traditional Korean BBQ experience to head to this place. And if you want loads of laughter to request Ian to be your server.  Thank you for the great time! Can not wait for the next opportunity to go back.",

We still needed to wait to be seated. Anyways a friend of mine went here to try there korean bbq, with me. and even though the hostess had a snarky attitude.. the rest was good the meat selections were decent, our waiter was very attentive and took good care of us, and was always checking on us if we needed anything. I was impressed by him..my friend ordered a hite beer which she loved and theres also larger size as well. So what can i say we did enjoy are selves. A day started off maybe a bit rocky but the rest was great! So try it out. It can be a bit pricey so go as a group and have fun! P.s. try not to let the hostess ruin your tonight. Cheers!",

Highly recommend the Marinated Short Rib, but AGAIN forgot to look at the specials board, didn't notice til we were up to our eyes in grilled meats! We ordered both pancakes, I think it was the Kimchi one I preferred as the other was just a little too soggy as far as texture... then Brisket, and I believe Prime Rib were also thrown on the grill.  This place will please any carnivore that isn't afraid of putting a variety of textures together for spicy, umami flavor bombs!",

We waited an hour where they said 30 to 40 mins. Bulgogi was dissapointing. Its cook more like sautee in a bowl so it was watery and fell apart. Not sure why they didn't grill it. Sliced Beef brisket was good. The spicy squid was the best (Very good flavor). Rice was extras cost. There were 6 of us and it came with 2 tiny bowl of rice so i didnt get that. All the extra side dishes like kimchi, radish and etc and was included and refillable. Overall it was good. Not bad for total price. 3 entrees and 20% tips was $87 and was plenty of food. They validate for the parking lot in the corner.",

But the experience was outright HORRIBLE!!! THEY JUDGE YOU BASED ON HOW YOU LOOK! After we finished our meals of almost $300, my dad went to the restroom before we hit the road. My father was wearing a big coat and his hair was disheveled from the cold and windy Chicago weather. Instead of asking politely or simply state that the restroom is for customer only, some cleaning lady who had came by our table earlier during the dinner to cut up our meats (but not our server) SHOUTS at him to \"GET OUT!\" He was confused, and still didn't catch onto the situation. Thinking that he was in her way, he told her that he wanted to use the restroom. She continue with the rude manners and shout \"RESTROOM FOR CUSTOMER ONLY. GET OUT!\" Now understanding the situation, told her that he eats here. She carries on with her rude demeanor and asked \"WHERE, WHERE YOUR TABLE!\" He pointed her to the big table where the 6 of us is sitting and waiting. She just walked off. No apology from her was ever given! When we spoke to our server, they all just kinda give a half hearted \"yeah, sorry we have a few man come to use..(restroom)\" and that it was accessible through the public doorway etc. No matter what the reason is, you CAN'T JUST ASSUME and treat your customer this way! And even if they are homeless people, they are a human being and there is no need for that kind of disrespect. Deny them the use of your restroom if you feel you need to, but there's never a need for that kind of behavior. A simple \"No, you may not use our restroom as it is for customer only\" will do...Why must one shout at another person as if they are an animal?! We are still OUTRAGE that we paid about $300 including the mandatory 20% tips, to have my dad be so DISRESPECTED with such indignation!!!! Also, on a side note, before dined we called when we were 10 minutes away to see if there were any waiting time or that we can make a reservations. They told us that there were NO WAIT and to just come. When we arrived, they told us that there is AN HOUR WAITING TIME . Unfortunately, we did. Should have left then! Reading from other comments after the fact, I believe it's the same tactic they use on every customer calling in. So if you called and they said that there's no waiting time, heed my warning!",

However, this time we are only ordered the others, instead of bbq combo.  At first, a female waiter brings us to a table, and then we ordered the foods. When we are waiting the food, the female manger came and tells us to move to another table. I think it is because we have three people but the table is fit for 5 people. We move to another table, and then we see a female waiter bring three people to the table was where we sat before. I don't know why they can sit there, but we need to move (maybe it is because we are not oder bbq combo). Also, the female manger keep telling us to sit in close to plant, and she said that the other table will have someone sat there and they need the spaces. But at that time there was a lot of empty table, I don't get why they can't let the other  customer to sit at the empty tables. The foods we ordered are so bad. The buckweat noddles in chled beff broth only tasted like vinegar and it's too sour. The taste of the noodles is particularly bad. We only finished a little of what we ordered. The bad servicer and the attitude make our mood become very bad. Also, it's my friends first time come to eat here, and they told me that this restaurant is on their blacklist.",

The location is convenient since its located at where all the asian cuisines are, its hard to pick what you dont wanna eat... Everything here seems typical. Beef quality is a little above average. But from my memories, it seems like they have changed suppliers for a couple of times... on their grand opening their beef quality was very good, the prime rib and skit beef has alot of marbling... then it got bad.... then on my recent visits it went back to A3-A4 quality again. I used to love their beef soup, sometimes would come up just for the soup, but now their quality on the beef soup has went down too much, not worthy of getting anymore. The pricing is alittle above avg korean bbq too. Everytime i am here will end up 80-90 per person. But since Chicago isnt like LA with a Korean Town to choose from, this would be the best place to go for korean bbq.",

A female worker made a mistake that she didn't give us a soy-bean soup and a rice even though we asked her many times until we finished our meal but she said she knows us because we came here to eat often, so she promised us give more service next time. Thus it was okay. we could accept it.  BUT on last Saturday, the annoying problem was happened. A server was so busy (I don't know why because there were no many people in the restaurant) , and he never came to check our table's meat. So, a female manager came to our table and flip our BBQ and it was already so burnt. She said she will bring another meat. That was great. But when we tasted the other meat, they were so bitter too! I called my table's server and he never came again. So I just put my hand up to call anoter worker and that female manager definitely saw me and ignored many times; I went to that female manager, and I asked 'can you change the other meat on our grill too?' and she said 'Okay I will and please call your server , not me'. Does it make senese to her customer? And both didn't came to our table anymore. So I just went to her again and said 'Our server never came to our table and our meats are getting cold already (because we asked him to change our grill since it was already burnt and he put our meat which was cooking on the grill on the plate and never came agin).' and then do you know what she told me?;; She said ' if you don't want to eat you can just go out' with a SNEER.  It was so terrible, rude, and inpolite. I am Korean and she was also Korean. I want to tell her ' Please don't stain the Korean face, Shame on you.' I've never had this kind of terrible experience before. She was the worst owner that I've met in my life. Actually, here's pork and beef quality is not good too. Just I missed Korean BBQ taste and came to here often. but never anymore. I will find another good Korean BBQ restaurant although it can be farther than here from my school.  Their service was soooooo horrible and annoying. I remembered a male manager was pretty kind, but at that day why that female manager act like that to us. I can't understand and forgive her. She ruined my precious weekend lunch time. I highly don't recommened this restaurant.  If you want to ruin your mood, go and experience it. Even though the workers are not that busy, they are also so lazy and inpolite.  \ud55c\uad6d\uc778 \uc5bc\uad74\uc5d0 \uba39\uce60\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc2dc\uace0 \uc190\ub2d8 \ub9ce\ub2e4\uace0 \uadf8\ub534\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a5\uc0ac\ud558\uc2dc\uba74 \ud55c \ubc29\uc5d0 \ud6c5\uac00\ub294\uac74 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4^^",

I was excited to try this restaurant for my birthday, since it\u2019s one of the few Korean BBQ\u2019s located close to Chinatown. Unfortunately, immediately walking into the restaurant with my group of 10 including my family and friends, we were met with a rude lady who pushed my family and I quickly to the side, saying that she was trying to \u201cserve other customers\u201d and that we had to make way. I called her out, saying that she was being rude and impolite to my family, but she dismissed my remark and made a nasty face at me instead.  I had made a reservation for my group, and we were subsequently seated, but the same lady was the one who started to serve our table. While getting the table set-up, she made it obvious to our group that she was unhappy to be serving us. \u201cMove, Im trying to set up!\u201d was yelled by her. Her tone was sullen and she continued to sulk at us, rudely telling my family members to move to the side when setting up our grill.  Further, when asking her if we could be served water, she obviously ignored us and continued to walk away with a sour look. We later learned that this lady was the OWNER. I was surprised and disappointed at how someone who calls herself the owner can act so unprofessional and incompetent.  Ultimately, we had decided to stay despite our encounter with the owner, since I was craving Korean BBQ and wasn\u2019t going to let her ruin my birthday. Fortunately, our waiters and waitresses were kind and tactful to our requests, unlike the leadership of this restaurant. We had ordered the large pork combo (seared pork belly, pork jowl, pork collar) and large beef combo (boneless short rib, thinly sliced brisket, prime rib eye). We had also ordered a couple beers.  I had personally thanked our waitress, telling her that I was grateful for her being so kind to us and that the owner\u2019s treatment of our large group was unacceptable and that restaurant owners should be role models of service and not disreputable. Despite us giving her our business (spent over ~$450), the owner continued to ignore our table and avoided eye contact with my family and I throughout our whole time there.  The food was delicious, but its unfortunate that its owned by someone so immature and unprincipled. I will NEVER support, promote, or perform business with this restaurant ever again thanks to her, and I hope that no one else has to ever experience such service from leadership. Thanks for ruining my birthday.",
