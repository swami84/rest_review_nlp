        "caption": "Where else can you have a quick lunch from a food truck turned deli in a museum? Washington, D.C. Here's what I enjoyed:  1) Location: The deli is on the second floor of the Women In Arts Museum in downtown D.C. close to Franklin Square Park. Even though it feels weird, you can walk past the admissions desk (no ticket required) to make your way up the grand stairway.  2) Space: It's in a grand museum with chandelier, marble stairs, and high ceilings. It's stunning and worth visiting for the exhibits themselves. The cafe has fancy tables nearby and the food comes out to you on plates within minutes.  3) Food: The menu is more unique than your standard deli. I ordered the Mr. Chips sandwich (chopped pork, bread & butter jalapeno, Manchego, cilantro, citrus mayo, toasted brioche). For $13, their sandwiches come with a side or soup. I opted for the butternut squash. I then paid $4 for a soda and a chocolate chip cookie. The food was good, but the sandwich and soup lacked bold flavors. It was good, but not memorable. The winner was the chocolate chip cookie. It was soft and very tasty.  I'm glad I went, but because of the lack of bold flavor in the food, I wouldn't run back.",
