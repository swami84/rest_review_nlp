We asked they lower the volume which they did and it was perfect. One person in our party ordered the pasta pamadora. It was too salty and they instantly made her a new one. It was still too salty for her. Several of us tried it. Some thought it was too salty. I thought it was salty but delicious so if you order the pamadora just be aware you should like your pasta salty.  Lastly the sauce on the pizza, the pesto sauce and the sauce in the gnocchi were all outstanding and you could tell the ingredients were fresh.  Special thank you to our server Karisma who went above and beyond and was on point all night",

I appreciate that the salmon was perfectly cooked to medium well WITH the skin still on it as a crispy layer. We could not decide on the dessert so we shared the Olive Oil Cake, the Olive Oil gelato and the Melon Mint Gelato. All were amazing but the star of the trio was the Olive Oil gelato. I ate it two days ago and I still can't stop talking about it. It was light and the Olive oil flavor added such a depth to the flavor. I highly recommend it. The Melon Mint gelato was also flavorful as the melon flavor was honeydew melon! In addition to the great food, the service was very gracious and attentive. I'm definitely coming back for more.",
