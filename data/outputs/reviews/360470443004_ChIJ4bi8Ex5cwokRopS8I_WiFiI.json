This means when I get a small container with veggies and ONE chicken leg, and the container is still not even half full, total is about 7-8 dollars and the food can barely feed a rabbit. Her cooking is delicious but I don\u2019t understand why I need to pay 7.30 for 13 ounces of food plus tax while I\u2019m running around at work...I get hungry in about 30 mins. I rather just go elsewhere.",
