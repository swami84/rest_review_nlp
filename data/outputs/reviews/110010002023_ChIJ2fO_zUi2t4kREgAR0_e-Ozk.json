The chicken teryaki was cold and tasteless. The rice was overcooked. The spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll were good. All other rolls, such as california roll, shrimp tempura and salmon roll did not taste good. The salmon was warm and these rolls should not have cooked or warm like salmon. Instead the fish should be fresh. Even though this was a carry out order the lady upfront demanded tip, before I even get a chance to offer her the money. Shrimp tempura was wet and soft and not deep fried or crunchy but completely soggy. We were 4 and only had to share the spicy tuna and spicy salmon roll. We trashed the rest as it was completely unappetizing. I would not recommend this place!!!!",

This is not the first time we and other Asian guests were poorly treated by her, if you read other comments left here. Part of the reasons, we guess, is her blatant reverse racism against other Asians. So our suggestion: never visit this place (anymore) unless you wanna experience what her poor service is.

I don't believe I'm obligated to justify my gratuity, but I explained to the waitress anyways why I didn't enjoy my meal. I would have still been okay here if she let things go - I understand that some customers do stiff people on tips so wanting an explanation is natural. But, the waitress would not let me go and seemed determined to embarrass me in front of my date (who agreed that the experience was bad and that the low tip was already generous). Eventually, I had to cut off our argument by saying that there wasn't anything left to discuss and that we were leaving.  I am never returning to Kintaro.",

Kintaro is located in Georgetown a half block off of the popular main strip (M St) in a classic DC row house/town house. The dining room is small, but cozy and includes a small sushi counter. You can get bento boxes, sushi, sashimi, ramen, onigiei, tempura, as well as some appetizer and dessert specialites listed within the restaurant (like takoyaki and green tea cheese cake). I highly recommend ordering sake, onigiri/tempura/karaage/seaweed salad/takoyaki, sushi, and ramen. If you order ramen, be sure to get a side of extra noodles and test out the different seasoning and spices they provide on the side. Please note that Kintaro is closed on Mondays and closes in between lunch and dinner hours. If you\u2019re looking for quality, affordable Japanese food in a quieter setting, Kintaro is an excellent choice. Itadakimasu!",

My boyfriend, who goes there weekly,  always gets the Tonkotsu a rich pork based broth served simply with seaweed, a slice of pork and fish cake. I like the miso, served the same but has marinated bamboo shoots, which I find to add depth to the light miso broth. The sushi is VERY good as well.They do not have tons of fancy rolls, but as simple fresh selection. The menu is very tailored  ramen, bento box and sushi. There are some other items on a hand written menu on the wall,  tempura shrimp and calamari which looked amazing, as other diners had each so I ate with my eyes...will try another time when less pressed for time Heads up, this is a TINY little place, I will stress tiny. Not ideal for parties of 4 or more, also, be nice..the food is fresh and is made to order so you may have to wait a bit, but it is worth it. It is above and beyond YUMMY!",

It's a very small restaurant with maybe a dozen seats and a narrow entry. Note, no public restrooms.  Given the chilly weather outside, we both decided to order ramen and I also ordered the spicy salmon rolls as an accompaniment. I had the tonkotsu ramen and I have to say, it's the most mediocre ramen I've had in DC. The soup base is not that flavorful and I couldn't really taste the pork-based bone broth that is the defining base ingredient of tonkotsu ramen. My bowl came with nitamago, pork belly, seaweed, ginger, and bean sprouts. Nothing was under or overcooked, but it was a very average ramen bowl to me. Having tried all the ramen shops in the DMV area, I have to say this is one of my least favorites.  The spicy salmon rolls were also...interesting. They added some spicy mayo dressing in the roll, a mayo/Sriracha combo I wasn't digging too much. It was a little too mayo-y and overpowered the roll.  Service was average too. Our server was half-present throughout our meal but expected us to leave a hefty tip. My friend and I were both trying to pay with cash. Our server came back with large bills most likely hoping that we would leave one even though that would have been over 20% for less than average service. She pursed her lips and looked annoyed when we asked if she could give us some smaller bills. It seems like a lot of other reviewers have had/experienced awkward tip encounters too.  Save your money for Sushi Taro or Kotobuki.",

The service, however, leaves much to be desired. The waitresses are rude, unpleasant and at times condescending, which is a shame given that the food is above average.",

The tobiko was a little too salty, but otherwise I loved the fresh, creamy fish and that pop of wasabi. Some of the best salmon I've ever had.  I do wish the $22 plate came with soup and/or salad.  We also shared a seaweed salad. Smaller portion but very tasty.  It's a tiny little restaurant that doesn't take reservations, so just make sure you have a back-up in the area if they can't seat you.  Not the place to go if you like \"fun\" rolls. The rolls here are straightforward (e.g., tuna, spicy tuna, eel+avocado, salmon+avocado).",
