We were able to reserve the chef's table which is actually inside of the kitchen. It was amazing to watch the chef and cooks in action. They were quiet and focused, and the energy was calm like a professional kitchen should be. Chef Bryce created a tasting menu for us and we unanimously agreed that it was one of the best meals we've ever had. Mind you - most of us work in fine dining and have enjoyed exquisite meals around the world so that is saying a lot! Course after course was perfection on a plate. Simple yet high quality ingredients were thoughtfully put together to bring out the best flavors, which is what great Italian cuisine is all about. Cocktails were amazing and the wine list has excellent selections that are very fairly priced. Andrew and Sully were so attentive and always anticipating our needs. We never had to ask for a single thing! Rocca is easily the best Italian restaurant in Tampa Bay.",

We told the waitress from the start that we probably were going to just order appetizers and the mozzarella with drinks because we don't eat really heavy at dinner time. She asked us three times what we were going to order for the pasta/entree.  I felt obligated to order an entree. We ordered the spaghetti and shrimp. Once again the taste and presentation was nothing out of the ordinary.  The only reason why I would go back is if guests were in town and we would order the mozzarella cart.",

The daiquir was unique and delicious. My favorite was the Amaro milk punch (with cognac no less)! It was like a dessert in a cup without being cloyingly sweet. For a diabetic, it's heaven in a fancy glass. Next time I'm hitting that Rye N Apples.  As for the food, we tried the Cacio y Pepe. It was truly some of the best pasta I've had. Perfect texture. Perfect sauce. Perfect balance between the two.  I am impatient to go back despite the hour drive from the beach.
