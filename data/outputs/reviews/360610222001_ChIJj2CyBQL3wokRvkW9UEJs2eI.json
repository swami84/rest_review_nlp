Any added sauce/veggies is 50 cents each. I got three added (hummus, onions, and tabouleh)  but the guy was really nice and only charged me for two (so i paid $6 total). he also sprinkled a bit of the hot sauce on it with no charge. and when i was paying, I was telling him how it was my first time there and how i think its a great place, and he gave me a free baklava for being new! (i don't think this is customary, i was just being chatty and think i caught them in a nice mood)  honestly their great people and great food, and i made sure to tip bc of it. ive also had their tabouleh before! really good too :)  highly recommend ! check them out! they really stuffed my falafel sandwhich :D",

Also i called the restaurant to let them know i wasn't satisfied with my food and requested a refund and the employee just told me \"come over here and get your refund if you want it\" with a nasty attitude. This was my first experience with them and it will be the last nothing authentically Mediterranean about this place the chicken spot has better Gyro's than here save your money please.",

Lunch specials around $11 bucks person and portions are not to bad. Food is not bursting with flavor but is good. Food served on plastic plates was a little unappealing although the wicker basket for the falafel sandwich was a nice touch. Would visit again in a few months to see what is improved.",
