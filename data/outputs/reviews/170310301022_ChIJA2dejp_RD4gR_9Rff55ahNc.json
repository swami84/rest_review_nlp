I live nearby so I\u2019ve frequented this store for a year now and can say from first-hand experience they should get their old management back. Stat.  Staffing: this store used to always have at least 2 people working at any given time, sometimes 3 during busy times. Since the new management has taken over, every time I\u2019ve been in there, there\u2019s only been one employee available making sandwiches. Today (Saturday, Feb 29) I walked into the store at 12:45. There were 3 customers ahead of me and right after I got in line, a group of 13 teenagers/college students came in. While rushes cannot always be anticipated, busy lunch and dinner times should be properly staffed. With only 3 girls in front of me, it took 20 minutes before I was even able to start my order.  Promotions: On Friday, Feb 28, I went to this store, and they had a sandwich board out front advertising \u201cBuy 1 6-inch, get one free of equal or lesser value\u201d. I placed my order for a foot long, and when I got to the register, the girl rang it up as a foot long. I inquired about the promotion, since my sandwich technically qualified. She then re-rang my order under the promotion and sent me on my way. Today, when I went to this store (a different employee was working), and she also rang me up for a foot long. I again inquired about the promotion, pointing to the coupons for it laying in easy reach on the counter. She handed me a coupon card, but explained that \u201cI\u2019m giving you the coupons today, so you can use them next time you come in.\u201d I explained that the day before, I was given the promotion without the need for any coupon (indeed, the offer was plastered on a sandwich board for all the world to see). She just kept arguing with me (with 13 customers in line behind me) that she wouldn\u2019t give me the promo today, I\u2019d have to wait til the next time I came in. I said, \u201cThere\u2019s a whole stack of coupons right there, so just take one of them.\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t do that. After going back and forth, I tore off a coupon from the ad she had handed me, which she also refused to accept.  Finally, after at least 10 minutes of this, she said, \u201cFine I\u2019ll give it to you since you\u2019re in here regularly.\u201d  TLDR: Staff your store properly so people don\u2019t have to wait 20 minutes to order their food, and honor promotions that you advertise instead of arguing with customers about them.",
