Seated at a window table made it even nicer.  The appetizer we ordered, the smoked salmon, was very nice and enjoyable. Light and tasteful without being overbearing or too filling.  However, both our main entrees were disappointing. My wife ordered the short rib pasta and I had the duck. Her dish was rather bland but also salty. My duck very overcooked and also very salty. While leaving, I spoke to another patron who also said his food was salty. Maybe that is the style of the cuisine, but seems excessive. Didn't get the saltiness out of my mouth until I got home ans brushed my teeth.  Overall it's a very nice establishment with a great staff, but the main courses were just too salty which overpowered any other flavors.",

The food was absolutely fantastic. The food blew us away. The service was even better. Our waiter was Rich and he treated us like VIP. He really made the whole experience and I highly recommend him! Our Rib Eye was the best we've ever had! And I've eaten at Gordon Ramsay's. Doesn't compare to what you get at the rib room. The duck was also delicious! And the dessert, the pecan pie holy cow. It was so good. Will be back next year!  I took a pic of my duck. Yum!",

I came into the restaurant in casual clothes for the dinner period and was under the impression that I might be turned away but I was pleasantly surprised and was seated. I have eaten at many steakhouses across the country, this restaurant has ranked better than most in treating customers not as high dressed. I had the special for the day prime rib with shrimp penne pasta cooked medium rare and it was done exactly like a medium rare steak should be. The main flavor came from the sauce it was cooked in but was tender throughout the steak. The steak was equally cooked so every bite was as good as the first. I parred my meal with a white wine which complemented the steak well. My service staff there was great and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't reach the bottom of my glass either water or wine without on of the excellent staff filling it for me. The manager stopped by my table to ask if everything was great which it was so we talked about some good steakhouses in Chicago and DC because I travel often it was a nice brief pleasant conversation. I followed my meal with apple cheesecake and a shot of port. It was not a fast meal but it shouldn't be fast. Also the proportions were as such that ordering an appetizer or dessert isn't out of the question and I am relieved as the dessert was great and I dont feel overly stuffed.",

Total in-out time: 1hr 51min  Server in the bar was anxious for shift change and had attitude when we mentioned we would have a full course meal at the high top.. after feeling her energy- we put our name on the wait list to be served by a dining room server. My appetizer did not come out with my significant other's, once brought to the servers attention- we could tell he forgot to put it in. I ordered a beer at this time as well since he would be going back to the POS. 8-10 minutes later my app is out and my beer is not. Remind server about beer, comes out with no head (on a rather hoppy amber I normally drink- this isn't normal unless it sat at the bar - forgotten.) Entre finally arrived, I can tell the larger 13oz steak I ordered is on my SO's plate with her sides and her 10oz steak is on my plate with my sides-  I mention to the server, I think our prime ribs are switched, she got a 10oz, I got a 13oz. He said it's the way it should be. I cut into my prime rib, it's medium well ( what my gf ordered). She cuts into hers, medium rare (what I ordered). I call the waiter over to replate our meals with the proper sides. Food comes back replated- now both baked potatoes are cold. Finish our mediocre $120 dinner, and the server asks if we are ready for the check.... my gfs meal came with a dessert so we remind the server about her dessert, he says of course- it's on the way... needless to say- for a rather slow night, it seems they could not do anything right. The prime rib was delicious.",

I ordered ranch dressing for my salad and the dressing was pretty \u201cwatered down\u201d and really didn\u2019t have any flavor at all.  That sounds nit-picky, but salad dressing should be an easy thing to get right. Next I ordered creamed spinach in place of a baked potato and it almost tasted like it had been sitting in the oven too long and had a brown/burned appearance. It also lacked flavor. Next, since really the meal was all about the steak I ordered a couple dipping sauces, a Bernaise and a Marchand du vin (which I was told was some sort of red wine reduction). The Bernaise didn\u2019t even come close to what I\u2019d expect. No depth, no flavor, just blah. The Marchand sauce tasted like it came from a packet. Very disappointing for such poor steak sauces from a supposed high end steak house. Lastly, i ordered the king cake bread pudding and it had more sugar/frosting than actual flavor (also had some miscommunication with my server because i asked if there was fruit in the pudding which he said no, but of course there was).  SO.....the prime rib itself was great, but for the prices I would expect the rest of the meal to be good as well but it just wasn\u2019t.",
