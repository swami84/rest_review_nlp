Their soy protein is an unbelievable chicken substitute, with a deliciously satisfying texture.  Try the soy protein with garlic sauce or curry stew - they're both spicy, filling, and amazing, and they're one of the few places that makes impeccable brown rice (not dry at all, and quite hearty).  I've been doing a lot of cooking because of the coronavirus situation, but I've started ordering out from some of Bay Ridge's amazing restaurants, including Shangri-La, Zio Toto, Gino's, etc., for the first time in months - everything I get, I make sure can be heated.  On top of the excellent meal, the folks at Shangri-La packed an envelope with my order, containing a face mask and note of well-wishes. :')  Overall, a phenomenal restaurant with very big-hearted proprietors and talented chefs.",

Sauces were negligent - the main item that I've seen brings taste to items like pad thai. Sweet potato noodles were interesting,  but again lacking in taste because of no sauce. Really didnt expect this, very disappointed.",

Yesterday I had the curry stew and although the vegetables are ok, (pretty hard to ruin those), if you're charging $15+ for entrees, you might not want to go with curry sauce from a powder packet. Just a tip. I could have stayed home and made that myself.  There's never anything here I'm looking forward to getting. I always get this weird feeling I'm getting a vegetarian TV dinner.  Plus what's with the tiny bowls of rice? Is there a cook from North Korea back there?  And not for nothing but the neighborhood must agree with me because I've never seen more than one other table occupied, even on a weekend. You guys really need to up your game a little. There's a dearth of vegetarian restaurants as it is.",

The service is always depressing and rude. The ambiance is glum. On a Friday night upon entry to the restaurant, instead of being greeted normally by the waitress, we were told the restaurant closes in one hour so we needed to eat and leave. Despite this, we stayed to eat as we both enjoy their food. I ordered from the in house menu that the waitress gave me. I ordered the pumpkin gazpacho that I have ordered from there several times and when my food arrived it was nothing like the description on the menu. The waitress got defensive and proceeded to argue with me, pulled out they menu and told me I was wrong. When I read the ingredients on the menu to her she then told me they changed the menu and this is the new way they make it. She said it's on the new menu and showed me a take out menu which was not shown to me at the time I ordered. Still she was convinced she was right and told me I didn't know what I was ordering. Then told me she didn't want to argue. I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN. I can not believe how rude she was. I can not believe how far we have come from good customer service. So disappointed in this place.",

        "caption": "Went here with my (very picky) family and had a good time! The sign says vegetarian but the whole place is actually vegan which is amazing considering the lack of vegan options in Bay Ridge. Was able to choose anything on the menu without ant worries. The place is also kosher which is also good to know if that matters to you. We had the summer rolls and spring rolls as  appetizers and I had the orange seitan with miso on the side. I usually don't expect things to be spicy when they have the little chili pepper next to them on the menu because every other place I've been to it never actually is, but the orange seitan and the General Tso's seitan my partner had actually were! I enjoyed it, but be warned if you're not into spicy food. They also have a fully vegan dessert menu, we got the brownie and the pumpkin cheesecake to share. The only reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5 stars is that the brownie was too hard and the summer rolls were a bit flavorless, and the sauce wasn't my favorite. Overall I do recommend this place as an awesome vegan option in Bay Ridge!",
