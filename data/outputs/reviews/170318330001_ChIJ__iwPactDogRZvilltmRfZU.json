Chang has been one of my favorite Americanized Chinese food (yes, it\u2019s a recognized style - just ask Americans Expats working in Shanghai) restaurants - for its food and exceptional service at a reasonable price point.  At a \u201cto go\u201d location, of course the service is harder to experienced (although no issue with my pick up order). The main disappointment is with the quality of the food: everything from the quality of ingredients to seasoning to creativity is not as good as before. So sorry to see this brand go downhill.",
