I arrived at the store and the manager who appears in the photo simply gave me 2 options, or he gave me the pizza after making it (because it was not done) or he canceled the order, these are the options that they give to a customer who waits 2 hours and  going to formally file a claim, as he saw me recording a video for google reviews, he came out to talk with me, abusively trying to get me to leave and even closing the door in my face.

I asked the guy who opened the door who was casually sitting doing nothing letting the phone ring over and over if they served pizza and if it was called frankies pizzeria. He said YES AND MIND YOU IT WAS 2:00am AND THEY CLOSE AT 3am. This man had the audacity to lie to my face and say that they were just closing. I told I placed an order a long time ago and I wanted to know what was up. He checked his computer looking all confused asked for my name and after 10 min they gave me my pizza.

They serve you a meat lasagna that has no meat, the tomato sauce is also disgusting and the cheese taste like low-grade cheese. DON'T ORDER  on Seamless or Grubhub, it's a CON, don't get fooled by the $5, they do that to con you into buying their horribly cooked food! They know their food is horrible and a misrepresentation of what they actually serve you and you can't demand a re-order or refund. It's truly disappointing that restaurants like this continue to operate on these apps, it creates a lot of hesitation for ordering in the future when restaurants like this are not held accountable for misrepresenting their food.",
