Every time I go in their rude, then I just placed an order for delivery and they didn\u2019t have one of the items. So they sent half the order. Spoke to the person that handled the order, apparently she called 4 times. Then it was 2 times. Also claimed she left a voicemail, when I don\u2019t have voicemail set up. Took her 4 minutes to even apologize, then said it was not her problem now because my husband had accepted the food, he didn\u2019t know what the order should have been. Fine you run out of things that\u2019s not a problem but don\u2019t send half and order and lie about contacting your customers. And also just apologize!",

So I looked up the nearest French bakery that can do delivery. Of course I was also lured in by the promising reviews of this place.  Ordered croissants, pain au chocolat and the true test of it all as always, a baguette. Once Uber Eats got here, I was so excited. The croissants were as good as the ones I had in France and the pain au chocolat was delicious! The baguette for some reasons, did not really meet my expectations. I'm not sure if I got unlucky or if Uber Eats somehow didn't manage to pack it well. It was really cold and quite tough to eat. Really hoping it was the latter, especially because I've heard great things about it, using French flour, etc.  Still loved most of the experience. Hope to be able to visit soon to check out everything else that they have to offer.",

Pastries are very good, even coffee is not bad how it might be.  Cozy little place in the South Harlem with bellow average sandwiches, good coffee and croissants.",
