We also waited about 10 minutes to get our order taken which is crazy because it is supposed to be a high end restaurant with good and fast service. I also noticed that another group came in, about 6 or 7 people and as soon as they sat down they got water and their orders were taken right away. I don't want to make assumptions and assume that the waiter was tending them faster because of their race but my friends and I felt as though we were not being seen as a priority because of the race that we are. As we were dining, we were constantly trying to get the waiters attention, told another waiter we needed assistance but nothing.. it seemed like it was a challenge to get some help in there which is not good customer service for the type of restaurant it is. The food was okay but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if the customer service was as good as other high end restaurants.",

Well, the thing is that I have a 14 months old daughter who has stranger anxiety and will not stay with anybody. I knew the restaurant is more about adults, because they don\u2019t even have kids menu. Plus it was my birthday and the last thing I wanted to do was to spend the night without my daughter. Okay, it didn\u2019t end there. After we were seated, the waitress came and she didn\u2019t even introduced herself, nor did she said \u201chello\u201d she just came and said, \u201c anything to drink?\u201d I was very disappointed after this, but I decided to give her a chance. We waited there for our water and she sent a guy who speaks Spanish to ask us in Spanish what we wanted to drink when we told her already what we wanted. She was very rude and had this angry face every time she came to our table. So, I told my husband that maybe because we were Latinos she thought we didn\u2019t have the money to pay the bill. Okay, when we were ordering she wanted us to hurry, it was the first time for the other couple that was with us, so they needed  more time. As the waitress I thought she was gonna say \u201cyou should try this it come like this, bla, bla, bla\u201d but no she was just trying to be done with our order. Anyways everyone liked their dinner. I do want to thank everyone in the kitchen for the great work you do. After we were done with our food, we asked for the check and we pay. On the reservation I had written down that the occasion was \u201cmy Birthday\u201d we saw that everyone was singing happy birthday to other people, so I thought \u201coh I am going to be next\u201d nope i was wrong nobody said anything. She took the check and left. My friend decided to tell our waitress after all and she came with another waitress. It was so weird cuz while they were singing they were just looking at my daughter. After they were done singing she left without saying anything else. I will never come here with my family or friends for the the food maybe but the service was very unfriendly and unprofessional.",

We certainly noticed that only our table was being disregarded in this manner. I do not want to say it was a race issue but I do not have another explanation for the poor service we received. Once we were finally able to speak to the manager, the waiter was a little more attentive but it was too little too late. We will never return to the DC location. Capital Grille or The Palm in Tyson\u2019s are much better options.",

Nevertheless, we decided to give them a shot. While I can say, my food was ok, my coworkers were HIGHLY disappointed. They both ordered jumbo crab cakes.....let's just say, The Palm apparently doesn't know the definition of \"jumbo\". On top of that, they weren't even good. I tried a piece. The quality was about the same or even less than a frozen Phillips crab cake you can buy at the store. Only the Palm's is a tad smaller. This is supposed to be the \"famous\" high end Palm Restaurant I've heard so much about. Finally, we received NO utensils or napkins (our order was to go). Giving them a 2 star rating is generous. Go to Joe's Seafood Prime Steakhouse for a better experience. The food is way better AND they give you utensils.  Take a look and tell me if that's \"jumbo\" to you",

The service, the meal and the ambiance are par excellence! When you walk through the door, you are transported back to a more elegant time in dining. The Palm epitomizes the phrase, \"Service with a Smile.\" We started with great cocktails and conversation at the bar with the always quick witted, Mary Pat who made us feel like we were at home with a welcoming smile and an amazing Martini. After being seated, wine we had brought from home was perfectly decanted and waiting at the table. Our server, Rubio, was super attentive and on his game. Throughout the evening, several staff and managers stopped by the table to check on us. Our glasses were always full (both wine and water) without ever having to ask. Our meal was outstanding. We had the Calamari to start which was great. My Wedge salad was almost a meal in and of itself. I ordered the 18oz New York Strip and asked for medium rare temperature which was exactly what I received. Once Rubio made sure we have everything he came back a moment lasted to make sure everything was cooked to order. Our family style sides were perfect and HUGE. We had the creamed spinach (which was fresh), the Fries (which were hand cut) and the potatoes au gratin (which tasted like Mom's). We finished the meal off with the best dessert on the menu, Warm, Homemade Cinnamon Sugar Donut Holes. If you are looking for an amazing experience all around, look no further than The Palm.",

The appetizer was the highlight of my experience - and the entree was delicious. The atmosphere was a bit uncomfortable - it was so loud that I had to scream across my own table to be heard, - not what I would expect at this kind of restaurant, but certainly not enough to merit a poor review. However, some of the side items ordered were unacceptable - soggy, tasteless, far from gourmet. But again - this is not a reason to leave a poor review - one does not go to a restaurant like this for the side items, and again the entrees were delicious.  After our tab was paid and my party left the restaurant, I shared my experience with the manager. I was treated rudely and the manager made it very clear that my concerns were not important to him.  It is difficult to appropriate a positive rating when the person managing a a restaurant of this quality displays verbal rudeness and neglect to his customers. Within this city there are numerous establishments that, price of the meal aside, have treated myself and my companions constantly and consistently with kindness - not to mention at the very least, thanking them for visiting their restaurant and inviting them to return.",

Spent a majority of the time just trying to chew through the meat.  For the price I would rather go to Bourbon steak or Joes or even DBGB. Sides were fairly bland.

That said however the atmosphere is quite Lively, the lights are not too bright, and the staff is very very friendly. The restaurant has an enclosed patio out front along the street, which is an excellent venue if you want to view of downtown DC. All in all, it is a fine dining experience, as long as you remember what you are buying. You are buying the name, and the possibility of running and do some of DC's more powerful and political people",

We were greeted warmly by the hostess when we arrived(although the entrance was dimly lit the remainder of the restaurant was much better). The General Manager Eric(sp?)immediately recognized my dad and quickly came over to say hello and take us to our table. He was funny and polite and gave a great first impression. Eric sat us at the back of the restaurant in a booth with my dad's regular server, Ladonna (I really hope I am spelling her name correctly as she was phenomenal.) We brought our own wine, and she quickly had it prepped and poured for us while I went over my food allergies. I have quite a few and I carry an EpiPen in case. We had planned to have lobster but unfortunately we failed to call ahead and didn't know they were out. While we pondered the menu Ladonna placed our appetizer of bacon wrapped scallops(which she had them cook in a different preparation to accommodate my allergies). For entrees my dad ordered a linguine with clams and a white wine sauce, and green beans(pictured). I ordered lobster mac and cheese and mushrooms (2 side dishes, also pictured). Throughout the meal Ladonna impressed me with her thorough knowledge of the menu, ingredients and preparation style for each item I asked about. She made sure everything I ordered was safe and any part that I couldn't have was modified to accommodate me. I saw how far she was willing to go to make sure I not only enjoyed my meal but stayed healthy after too. Her passion for the restaurant and her tables was amazing.  The entire time we were there I never saw her falter or miss a step in her job. She took care of all her tables with the same care and attention. I wish I had gotten the name of the busser for our table, he consistently kept our water glasses full and was polite and friendly the whole meal. Overall this was one of the most incredible restaurant experiences I have had. From the service to the food I wish I could give this location 10 stars for their incredible work.",

Best part was the warm donuts for desert or maybe it was the drinks. I gave 5stars because every course and every dish was outstanding.

When we arrived about 6:20 there were a lot of open tables and we were seated immediately.  However we found it strange that the Host originally tried to cram us right next to a large party when there were so many open tables. We asked to be moved just one table over.  Once seated there, the host quickly came back and said that we had to move because that particular table was promised to someone else who by the way was not even at the restaurant at the time.  My husband stated that he did not care to move as there was no \u201cReserved\u201d sign on the table and more importantly this was such an unusual request. The Host basically said he didn\u2019t care what we thought and proceeded to ask us to move to another table. We were then seated in a booth in the very back of the restaurant near a door. I shouldn\u2019t leave out that we were offered free glasses of champagne for the inconvenience. I rarely play the race card however I couldn\u2019t help thinking that was part of why we were being treated this way.  My husband and I were so stunned and humiliated that I asked that we leave. I could not justify spending our hard earned money on such a special day in an establishment that clearly needs racial bias and sensitivity training. We ended up at Ruth Chris. Their staff was very attentive, treating us with the upmost respect. The Palms should get with the program, especially in the climate that we\u2019re in today.",

We had the Lobster and it was fresh, perfectly cooked and delicious. The Brussels sprout and carrot cake were amazing too. The restaurant itself was extremely clean inside and out and I loved the relaxed atmosphere/ambiance. I'll be back asap to dine at this Palm location****** I am planning to visit this Palm location soon and I cannot wait:) I have Never been to any Palm Resturant but I have called this restaurant twice in the last 6 months just as a regular Customer. I have always done this long before I was a GLG. The reason I do this is because I can tell a lot about what type of Customer Service and Care I'm probably going to receive in person from establishments/businesses just based on one telephone call. This Palm location now has my personal highest rating of '10' in my book in every catagory, including Superb Telephone Etiquette/Telephone Customer Service and Care. I am really looking forward to my visit and I will Update this Review immediately after my visit:)",

The one thing I don't like is that you have to order side dishes, since the mains come with no frills (and especially at the prices your paying), but I decided not to dock them a star for that, since food quality was high. That said, the extra you are paying is for the service. I've had the same quality food for less other places (which included sides). So, price is my main complaint. Everything else was flawless.",
