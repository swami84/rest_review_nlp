It was also obvious that everyone else who was dining was enjoying their time and that the staff was paying attention to details. The food was delicious and is plated beautifully! It makes for an extra special evening when the head chef himself visits the guests whilst dining and puts a face to the great meal. I'm not one to try new food each time I visit the same restaurant, but I just don't want to miss a single dish at Reality Bites. Can't wait to be back!!!",

I had a burger which was good. The menu has a decent variety- a few people in our group got tacos which they all raved about. The beer selection leaves a lot to be desired, but I do think they are known for specialty drinks so it is what it is.",

        "caption": "Alright. Here we go. Before coming to this place I had passed it multiple times. I always looked forward to one day actually going, well yesterday was that day. I was excited to try it out. Let's start with service. Our original waitress was new, so she didn't know anything about anything on the menu. I understand being new can be difficult, but when you don't even know what the restaurant you're working for is serving you are no help to anyone, carry a cheat sheet or something. Memorize it. Idk. Anyways the food. The food was meh. We started with the goat cheese balls and the bang bang shrimp. The goat cheese balls were good, but they weren't quite there. The balls were huge. The ratio of breading to cheese was not ideal. Smaller balls would be ideal. Lol As for the shrimp, it was weak I could literally go to Kroger, get frozen shrimp, throw it in the oven and dip it in spicy mustard and it would be the exact same thing I received at this place. I also tried the bacon wrapped dates which were far too wet and far too burnt. I then tried the smashed chickpea sandwich, while it was okay, again it just fell short. Not a lot of flavor. For desert we got cake bites and brown butter cake which was really good. I have zero complaints about the desert. Ya'll can absolutely improve and I will probably eat there again in the future and give it another try. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udd2e",

We ordered very much tapas style getting a special app (bang bang shrimp) as well as the goat cheese balls. Then we split the smashed chickpea sandwich with fries and finished with the cake bites and the brown butter cake.  All and all the food was 50/50 hit or miss. The shrimp was decent & the cheese balls were okay. The sandwich was pretty good and so were the fries. The cake balls were okay: lemon was solid but the red velvet was bad, honestly. The butter cake was awesome. Overall, the menu made it sound like we were going to get something spectacular but then it came out looking kind of thrown together.  If everything was 2 to 4 dollars cheaper I'd be all in on this place. But I spent $50 for a meal I could make myself.  Beyond the food, the decor was beautiful but the service was subpar because our waitress was new and hadn't really memorized the menu at all. The whole process took longer than I'd have liked. I might go back again, but not likely when I can go somewhere else with similar prices.",

Risotto was delicious but wish there was more shrimp and for the tacos there was barely anything in them. It was more tortilla than anything. Disappointed especially with how pricey the items are. Would expect a bit more food for the price as well as a better presentation. For dessert, I ordered the blueberry crumble which was good.

When I told her, she didn't give an apology or anything, just took it and went back inside...we thought it was really gross so we told them we were going to eat elsewhere and they didn't care.  \"okay bye\" is all they said...seriously?

It's the type of place that can be fancy or casual. They even do events like whiskey or wine tastings. Check the calendar. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. This is some of the best food I have ever had and the restaurant was clean, quite, and had a good atmosphere. I couldn't believe this awesome place was just down the street from places like Fat Jacks, Drifter's, and Mulligans.  I got the Mahi-Mahi, which had crab meat and panko bread crumbs on top, next to mashed potatoes (to die for) and some of the best asparagus I've ever had. The staff is extremely knowledgeable-half my relatives have a gluten intolerance and they knew exactly what couldn't be on certain items and what could. This restaurant also has gluten free menus, which can sometimes be hard to find.  All in all I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this place!",

The food was great, the goat cheese balls were extremely memorable, they know how to use the right amount of spice, the portions were perfectly sized, every plate that went past us to another table looked and smelled amazing and the staff was friendly but not overbearing.  I would highly recommend this to any food enthusiast!",

Although if you are dumb enough to order seafood in Illinois you might as well go to Long John Silvers.  I had great service and the owner even came by my table to check on us.  The place was packed so we waited 20 minutes at the bar.  I will definitely be going back. I'm always looking for a restaurant that is not a chain and finally found one worth going to.",
