In the pita, they gave a very generous amount of meat, topped with a nice balance of lettuce, tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was very fresh and had a lot of fresh garlic, which I love! The only 1 star review on Google said the meat was dry and the tzatziki sauce was from a jar. This could not be further from the truth. I could literally taste the fresh ingredients in the sauce and the meat was still moist the next day after reheating! The fries were very good as well; fresh cut and crispy. The price was extremely reasonable for the portion size. I couldn't even finish half of this gyro, so I had lunch the next day as well. I will be returning to Louie's Gyros soon.",
