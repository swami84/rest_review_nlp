We were the only ones dining in the whole place out back in the backyard space that was nicely put together...thank goodness for the neighboring music that made it a better experience. Now onto the food... ordered the lobster Mac & cheese (a lil peppery), calamari which was pretty good, french fries were ok as well, the salmon with rice and peas and veggies (that barely any) and the Salmon was on the dry side.  Then we had the escovitch fish w/rice & peas and asked for oxtail gravy on the rice (for both dishes) but instead we just got browning sauce.  Now the drinks we ordered were a virgin pina coloda because they didn\u2019t have any regular drinks like juice or soda, a white wine and he recommended the henny sangria which was the only thing correct.  We received a passion fruit drink and a red wine without asking if we wanted it instead.  But was told that their policy doesn\u2019t allow return of drinks (but that\u2019s not what we ordered  They also charged $5.49 for the use of a credit card instead of cash without informing us of the transaction.  Giving them a 3 was generous because they need to do better.",

I ordered the coconut shrimp which was very fresh, cold fish and plantains and curry shrimp $18. The food was good, but the prices are a bit steep for a neighborhood spot. I got a shot of patron and was charged $ 13??? No way ! I think the owner needs to adjust the pricing , it's ok to make a profit but if you want returning customers you need to not be greedy.",

Two of them got their food and when I go out to eat, generally, wait staff checks in with the table 2-3 times-ish. The birthday girl told her sister and cousin to eat assuming her plate was coming and it never came an hour after placing the order.  After wait staff finally realized this, she was told he forgot to put her order in. That blows considering it was HER birthday. They did nothing to accommodate the error on their part. The other two enjoyed their food but either way that was terrible customer service and I\u2019m kinda upset she didn\u2019t enjoy her birthday dinner because she had none! Lol. The irony.",

After she sat us down, we waited about 12 minutes, no utensils, no water, no interaction. My wife and I decided it was time to go. Now ANY establishment that wants to be profitable and successful, prides itself on the basis of excellent customer service. As we were putting on our coats said hostess/server had not ONE word to say.  Now I'm no expert, but if I noticed someone was leaving my establishment or even my home, I'm going to ask \"are you ok?\" \"is there anything you need?\" Etc. Don't get me wrong, the spot looks like a chill place BUT left a very unimpressionable first impression. Maybe we'll try again another time.",

I dont want to sound like a disgruntled customer so let me begin by saying the venue although small is well put together and the DJ was spinning some good tunes.  What puzzled me was that the bar was not packed and we waited, no lie, more than 30 minutes to be acknowledged and another 15 minutes for the only bartender working at a bar on Friday night to take our drink order.  There were other workers there just holding up the wall and not giving a care in the world.  There was a lady that looked like the owner or manager which I tried my best to get her attention with no success.When I finally placed our 2 drink order, it was served in a small plastic cup and to add insult to injury, 2 normal drinks came up to $39!!! That's in Brooklyn on Ave D people.  Just like you guys I've been to manyl bars all over this town and this has to be the worst experience by far. Horrible customer service and watered down expensive drinks. If there was a rating under 1 star they would have earned it.  Our people....smh",

Anyhow, with all the mishaps the general manger and her team were great. They didn\u2019t fall under pressure and they made it there goal to accommodate and make everyone satisfied. They never frowned or show a bad face cause it got hectic. Everyone that ate was satisfied with the food, the drinks was amazing. Well the drinks we ordered. Overall I would definitely go back but not with such a big crowd....",

The first time I visited I brought my dad for a birthday dinner on a Sunday and it wasnt very busy. The waitress was sweet and gave me mimosas although it was past brunch time, the manager came and checked on us, the chef even passed by and asked how we liked the food. This second time I went back with friends and we stayed until the place closed! The GM hugged us and walked us out herself. The bartenders were experimenting with new drinks and were bringing around sample shots throughout the night. We ate, drank, and had a good time. Vivid is definitely a place to go for great food, reasonably priced drinks, great music, and that good Caribbean hospitality. (Pics from my first visit)",

The ackee and saltfish was pretty good but the festivals (fried dumpling) wasn't to my liking. I didn't expect it to have a sweet flavor. It tasted like it was cooked with either cinnamon or vanilla extract but my friend enjoyed it so it's just a matter of preference.  The Virgin Miami Vice drinks tasted amazing but it wasn't worth $13 (there was no alcohol so that's a little high).  The service was exceptional. Because of that, I will be back.",

I was told by the manager who was drinking alllllll night that I was \"f***ing ignorant\"! Disgusting. We waited 30 minutes before even being given a menu or even a glass of water. I had to approach the bartender who came over 10 minutes later to serve us.  We ordered the coconut shrimp as an appetizer, it never came out until we got our entrees, 20 minutes later. The shrimp were tasty. However, the lobster mac and cheese, which is usually delicious, was bland and watery.  I ordered a sexy storm, substituting the vodka for Hennessy. My server said sure no problem. She later returns at the end of our service and hands us our bill where I was charged 14 additional dollars as an uncharge on a $10 cocktail. I explained to her that she did not disclose there was an upcharge, especially of that amount, for the substitution. She replied saying \"Oh I thought I did, but either way did you think you were going to get the Hennessy for free?\". That's when the drunk manager came over and became combative and told me he's not fixing it because I drank the drink and if I were in the city I'd pay whatever upcharge they wanted and I was f***ing ignorant.  I'm a social elite! I pride myself in supporting black businesses, as I'm a hardworking West  Indian American myself. I've been to many reputable establishments all over the tri-state and NEVER have I been spoken to or dealt with in such a disrespectful and condescending matter as I did last night. Especially as a paying customer. Unfortunately, that's the last time I'll support this establishment. I'm absolutely appalled!",

I would go into more details but the damage is already done.We enjoy each other's company so we made the best of it. Very unprofessional set of people as far as the want to be managers.

The escovitch fish was really delicious.  We were disappointed that it was CASH only (which I did not see mentioned anywhere on Google). They do have an ATM but why would I want to be charged by their atm and my bank? We would\u2019ve ordered way more food and drinks if they had taken debit. Another thing mentioned on the menu is there is a 25-35min wait for entrees (don\u2019t go starving like I did) and there\u2019s a 15% gratuity for parties of 3 or more. I don\u2019t think our food took that long though!  I would go back prepared with cash so that I can have a drink and try other dishes.",

However, I was able to manage conversation just fine, and I prefer overly attentive to not attentive enough any day. I highly recommend the escovitch fish tenders. Like, do your life a favor and order this. Impeccable flavoring. I also tried the cod fish cakes, and the jerk chicken with rice and peas. I loved everything.",

The worst part is the manager refused to recognize the mistake on their part and was very content on charging me more than $19 for my meal although I did not ask for an extra lobster tail.

Nothing seemed ready and everything was slow. Even cutlery and plates seemed short. And although their wait staff is very friendly, they were not equipped to handle a group of 18. We were ready to drink and have fun but drinks were slow to come and there was a huge mix up with our food order. Half of the party was served and the order for the other half was lost. Again nice place, great food and drinks, but not for big groups. I would say maybe 4 - 6 people max.",

This was around 5pm on a Thursday. One would assume all major drinks would be prepared. I had to settle for a cosmopolitan.  Even when I left around after 7pm, daiquiris were still unavailable.  Also there seemed to be a staff meeting, which prolonged services even further. Having gone before, it felt like a no brainer to go for my birthday, but that day I was very disappointed.",

As I was waiting for just simple drinks, waitresses and management were arguing a few feet from our table, then our waitress (I kid  you not)  QUIT right on the spot! Another 30 minutes waiting for my food. It tasted OK. I finally asked for the check and even that took another 15 minutes!

They played some great music. They had a separate Caribbean restaurant week menu. I ordered the Jerk chicken with rice and peas and their rum punch. My friend had the salmon with rice and peas. My food was pretty good even though the portion was smaller. However,  I really can't complain because my meal was only $6. My drink was surprisingly equally delicious and if I didn't have to go work early the next morning I would've had another one. I will definitely return to chill and eat.",

Similar to what you experience when you go to a night club. the place is not very big and has a bar that took up half of the restaurant. For a Saturday night. it was not crowded at all. My friend ordered the Jerk chicken with rice and peas as well as a rum punch. I had  the honey glazed salmon with rice and peas. I didnt get to try my friends food but she said that it was really good. My salmon was really good but I thought the rice ad peas was just OK. The service was excellent and our waitress was very helpful.",
