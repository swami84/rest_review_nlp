I had the pleasure of working with Event Planner, Jenifer Fedeli at Sullivan's to organize this event. Needless to say she was amazing throughout the whole planning process and made excellent suggestions and input. The night was a success and I received compliments from all attendees raving about the ambiance, food, service, and cost. If anyone is thinking about planning an event at Sullivan's I would highly suggest this steakhouse for a successful event! This will be my go to Steakhouse for future events to come!!",

They didn't mind taking it back but the next one was raw in middle. Then I decided to get lamb because my husbands was good. I said I would take it to go because we were disgusted.  Well, the bones on the lamb chops were burnt and the sauce on side wasnt the same as the 1st order. I will never go there again. I understand that they just opened back up and thats why it should've been good. There was hardly anyone there do the chef shouldve tsken his time. I know those burnt chop was deliberate. Had the steak appetizers that was just ok because I can tell they were already done and refried. Horrible! I  dont know how they hired that chef. I want to post pictures of the 2 orders of lamb. 1st one okay, 2nd horrible, I take it he didnt like me complaining.",

The mac and cheese, mushrooms, and bread pudding were all delicious as well.They are fantastic. the Service as very friendly and responsive. We were seated promptly without a reservation, but in suspect a reservation is usually best for place like this. The decor is well put together, with a bit of 1950s demeanor. Location is solid, right off light street, which can offer free parking at night. Price will not be your friend here, but that's not why you come here, and compared to other higher end steakhouses its price competitive. I reccomend you stop in for the lamb chops, come back for the ribeye if you like the lamb.  Traveler and Adventurer - IG @brian.dent",

I spoke to the manager and he had the worst attitude, as if he could care less.

I invited a few of coworkers out for a drink and food and figured no better place then Sullivan\u2019s, needless to say I was Embarrassed. The waiter we had took more than 40 minutes to check on our table, we would\u2019ve had more drinks but only settled for 1 because she disappeared for long periods of time. We decided after receiving poor service we would leave, it took almost an hour to get out check and when we reminded her for the check she got an attitude. Instead of her providing professional service she felt the need to ask with attitude if we wanted a manager, maybe we should\u2019ve spoke with a manager but that should only be asked for escalated concerns. I will rethink sending business here and even spending my money. Donesha needs serious training.",

From the time we entered everyone was so nice and greeted us like we were regulars. Justin, our server, was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. His recommendation of the blueberry lemon drop martini was SPOT ON and so yummy! My ribeye was cooked to perfection and so flavorful and tender. My cheesecake, which I took to go, was a heavenly midnight snack. If I'm ever on Baltimore again, I wont hesitate to go back to Sullivans!",

I was told if I had 12 guest it would be possible for me to eat in the regular dinning. The day before i was told i couldn\u2019t reserve a regular dinning area, and the event coordinator that approved it didn\u2019t realize the rules were changed. I was never notified of this change a head of time. Luckily once we arrived to the restaurant they accommodated my party size. Unfortunately that was the only good thing about this place. Appetizers took forever to come and it literally took 2 1/2  hrs for our main course to come. When we  asked to speak to the evening  manager about the extreme delay in service he responded rudely and dismissive. He even went as far as to walk away while we were talking.I asked for my birthday cake to be brought out because my guest were leaving due to the bad service. It took 30 mins for them to bring it out. The excuse was that they were trying to put candles on it...the cake came out with NO CANDLES!  I have received better customer service at Friday\u2019s then here! Only once I became upset because my birthday dinner was a disaster did the manger change his tune. He gave an apology and made an excuse as to why he walked off on us. The manager adjusted the bill but my birthday dinner was already ruined and my guest were ready to leave. I was completely embarrassed and hurt that we were treated as if we were a burden or a waste of time. I sincerely hope that this restaurants evening staff learn to be considerate of others. I would not recommend coming here for any celebration. It\u2019s not worth the money or time.",

First I called early that afternoon and made our reservation we with someone named Dexter.  Who took all my information and told me the reservation was made. When I called back later to confirm I was told by a young woman that one had never been made and wasnt treated like I had even made one till i mentioned the young man's name. Once we arrived they were sat at a table with rose petals on the table, this would have been so lovely had most of the petals not been very wilted and the menu my boyfriend was given was covered in wine stains. Our waitress was very busy, we were told they were short staffed but with 4 other tables , we rarely saw her and it took an 30 mins to get our order taken. Honestly it felt like she was more concerned with tables where she thought the tips were at. Our drinks came out very late aswell which kinda made the wait twice as bother some.  A cocktail would have helped pass the time. We almost filled up on bread trying to make it till our appetizer arrived. The manager was running around making up for the slack to the point when we left we tried to tip her personally  aside from our waitress bcuz we thought she was the bar back. I also told my waitress which glass of wine I would like with my steak and she didnt bring it out till I was well into my steak. She took my plate before I was done eating and stuck another plate on top of my 59 dollars steak so quickly I had no time to ask for it back.  For the 230$ we spent on dinner , we expected much better service. I wouldn't recommend coming here bcuz of the fact the service didnt match the price thou the food was delicious. I was very excited to come here after doing my research for the best steak houses in Baltimore and I choose them over Ruth Chris's and I'm not sure if I choose correctly. The manager was lovely and so was the young man who busted our table.",

Our server checked on us and kept us updated with the timing of our food. She even noticed my fianc\u00e9 stepped outside to smoke and she went outside to tell him his dessert was waiting at the table. Sullivans is quite pricey if you\u2019re  not going during restaurant week however the food was delicious, the ambiance was on point and service like the one I experienced with Rocky makes it all worth it!",

I was highly anticipating my return to one of my favorites for the atmosphere, the staff and the food!  Unfortunately things change and great things do not last forever, I was very disappointed with my most recent visit.  As soon as I walked in I knew things were different.  There was no crowd, this place used to be busy, even the bar was close to empty.  The house music, in my opinion, was terrible; Bing Crosby was playing, felt like a wake.  The music used to be upbeat, lively jazz fusion which created a great vibe throughout the restaurant, not old school yawn fest music like Bing Crosby.  Even the website talks about the music being lively with an unforgettable atmosphere, not this time.  And I guess there is no longer a dress code or at least a preferred attire policy.  Many patrons were in ordinary t-shirts with graphics and some had jeans low enough exposing their underwear, all the while being quite loud, even using a cell phone on speaker.  I felt like I was at a local fast food restaurant, certainly not at a steakhouse promising lively atmosphere and unforgettable experiences.  The meal and service were decent but nothing special, not like the many times I had visited before.  My steak was over-cooked as was the $60 1lb lobster tail.  The server never asked if entrees were cooked to our order nor if I would like any additional cocktails after my first.  One positive was the server being very attentive to our food allergies, which we greatly appreciated.  Also, we were disappointed there were no Gluten-Free options for desert, not even sorbet!  Many visits prior to this we would stay 2.5 - 3hrs and running up the tab to $300- $400 per couple, but this visit had me ready to leave after an hour and unfortunately feeling like I had severely over-paid for the experience we received.  Unfortunately we left deflated and extremely disappointed with our entire experience.",

Expected to have a server with an attitude and halfway decent food because of the late night visit and people wanting to go home. That was not the case. I ordered the cowboy steak.  The rest of my family ordered a mixed green salad, 2x sea bass, New York strip steak, and a filet mignon. Everything was cooked as requested. Sides were mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and broccoli. Everything was absolutely fantastic.  I don't recall our servers name but he was great. He was patient and never gave us the stink-eye for making him stay late :) Desert was New York cheesecake and key lime pie; just as good as the rest of our dinner. This place does not skimp on details with your food. They strive for perfection.  None of us expected to have such a great dining experience.  It all started off with  simply finding something open late at night. Definitely coming back.",

When we pulled up to valet the valet did not approach our vehicle. We put the window down to and stared at them with no assistance. We thought we had stopped at the wrong spot so after sitting there for 3 or 4 minutes without assistance we drove around the block pulled up again same person was there. We proceeded to get out of our car when he walked over to help us. We went inside to the check in desk which was empty.  Again not sure we were at the correct spot since it was in an odd location. We looked around for assistance while waiters walked past us without saying a single word. We finally grabbed one that had walked past us twice and asked if we were in the right place. He said he would get the girl who works the desk. Upon being seated we ended up with the same guy who found the front desk person as our waiter. He did not appear knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our orders and proceeded to wait while another couple came in their waiter told them all of the specials made recommendations etc. Their salad arrived all the while we were still waiting for ours and had arrived at least 20 minutes before them. We were about to find our waiter when he walks by nonchalantly sees that we never got our salads and brings them to us. He walks away ans comes back 2 minutes later and says apparently the kitchen is moving faster then usual and your food is already ready so you want it know or do u want to wait. Of course we asked for it immediately. Someone came to refill our waters and ran out of water at a half of glass instead of coming back to to it off he never came back. The food was another story. The cheese steak egg rolls we're the best thing I ever had in my life. I ordered a medium well steak which should have some pink and it was well done. The waiter never asked if it was okay nor did he come back to check on us until it was time for the check. Overall not a good experience. The next time I'll just do carryout for the eggrolls only. For the price our experience should have been much better.",

We had been to the Sullivans in Omaha, NE, where we lived prior to moving to the Baltimore area, many times without incident.  It was our go to destination if we wanted a quality steak.  We had been to the Baltimore location on two prior dates and the experience was good, but not exceptional.  This last time was a disaster.  We had ordered the white cheddar au gratin potatoes, Brussels sprouts and a 16 oz. Ribeye, cooked to medium.  In addition, we had ordered salads, which were fine.  The steak had come out and was medium rare.  We requested the steak be sent back.  After about 10 minutes, our waiter brought the steak back.  It was STILL medium rare.  At that point, since we had cut into the steak multiple times, I had asked for them to simply start over with a new steak.  On the third try, it was ok.  It was very thin, compared to the one they had presented us with prior, and very salty.  But, my wife and I did manage to consume about 2/3 of it.  The au gratin potatoes were not cooked throughout.  They were very hard in the middle.  When we spoke to the manager about them, he said we were the third table to complain about them.  Thankfully the knockout martinis were good, and the best part of our meal.  In defense of the establishment, they did not charge us for our meal, only our drinks.  Regardless, we will not find ourselves coming back here again any time in the near future.  We'll continue to make Ruths Chris our go to while still in the area.",

Asked about our table twice while at the bar, then after 45 minutes we were told our table was given to anther party. Was offered drinks as compensation not bad but should not happen. There was something spilled on the on the floor next to the bar when we walked in, a wet floor sign was put up at some point. When we left nearly two hours later spill was still there. As we were leaving after a steak dinner that wasn't all that a rodent ran from the kitchen to the hostess stand. This establishment seamed poorly managed I will not go back.",

The crabcakes is another one of our regular choices, it was fried to hard and was not appetizing at all. This was a huge disappointment because we travel over 45 to an hour to visit this establishment each year and it really ruined our anniversary. Also, our waiter never mentioned our Anniversary until we asked for the check and bought us out a frozen slice of cheesecake that was just the icing on the cake! There is definitely a change in the food and service, and it's very disappointing because we started this tradition with your restaurant and now we don't know if we will return..",

I mentioned to our waiter that I couldn't drink it because it was cold. He said yeah it's not on the menu anymore.  I told him I had no idea it wasn't, as he didn't mention that when we ordered them. He said he would take it off the check, which he didn't and we had to remind him to do so. We had our leftovers boxed up to go. When we got home, he didn't put my asparagus in the box. I had it all cut up on my plate ready to be boxed up. Last year everything was fine except the waiter spilled ice cold iced tea on me. Sat there in wet clothes eating my Turkey dinner. Think this will be the last time we go there. Time to look for another place.",

We seated ourselves in the bar area where we waited 15minutes to have the one server come over to us; we asked for menus; she appeared miserable from the get-go. She didn\u2019t even take a drink order.  We ordered a $45 dollar steak and a burger which we asked to be cooked well, well, well done.  As we waited for our food we noticed a chicken dish served raw to the table next to us (they comped that tables meal) and another table have there dinner served on three separate plates; each dish coming out in delayed succession and not together. The soup they ordered didn\u2019t arrive and only did after they complained and said they would no longer like it.  Some of the food they ordered didn\u2019t come out at all and the manager had to apologize that they no longer had it in stock. So they took there order, waited till the rest of the food was prepared then served what they had available. Only then telling them that there order would be incomplete.  When our food showed up the burger was raw and not cooked as requested. The $45 dollar steak came alone, on a plate with no vegetables, no compliments whatsoever.  The washrooms were in dire straights, the service scarce, the hospitality completely missing. I\u2019ve never been to a $$$ steakhouse for a date night that turned out this miserable.  By the time our undercooked burger came back from the kitchen we had lost all appetite to eat or be in Sullivan\u2019s any longer.

We arrived it smeled outside but that is Baltimore not the restaurant.  Only saving grace was our waiter.  We ordered a bottle of wine and after 10 min the waiter came back and said they didn't have it recommened another similar.  It was okay.  The food came out the steak is over seasoned with pepper and the potatoes were cold.  If I was at a Fridays or Applebee's whatever but this is supposed to one of the best in Baltimore.  Oh yeah and the bathroom was so gross water and pissed on the floor none of the toilets were flushed.  Felt like the cappy neighborhood bar.

We arrived with reservations and had to wait 22 minutes for a table. Why have reservations? Lukewarm steaks, grossly undercooked and even worse, served on cold plates. Seriously, $48 ribeye on a COLD plate? Ordered medium well and received a bleeding and bloody rare steak. Then the broccoli seemed to have either sand,dirt or some type ground gritty substance in it. It was not the kisher salt for sure.....We returned it out of fear for our health and requested they do an autopsy to determine what foreign substance may have been added to our broccoli. Very concerning and disturbing. Hours after dinner I was still feeling the grit between my teeth. Neglectful service from our waiter, probably because we were not ordering expensive wines or multiple cocktails to make us a larger ticket table. 2 managers stopped by and comped 1 steak but the dinner was still an epic fail. Money was not an issue.....we expected a high food quality meal, even with neglectful service.I am still very concerned and having anxiety about what foreign gritty substance was in that broccoli that I swallowed 2 bites of.....Sullivans never again for our group.",

The entrance smelled of gas, and although it is due to the gas line on the street, isn\u2019t the first thing I want to smell when I walk into a nice steakhouse. At 7:30 on a Saturday night, the restaurant wasn\u2019t too crowded but it definitely filled up as the night went on. We ordered the calamari which we all really enjoyed. However, our waiter made a snarky comment about how fast we ate it. The comments kept coming during our soup course of lobster and shrimp bisque. At least the soup was good. For the main course, 2 of the 4 guests ordered the crab legs. The crab legs tasted fishy and didn\u2019t have the same buttery taste like other king crab legs that they had had. I and another member ordered the NY strip from the price fixed dinner. The potatoes came with ham and we don\u2019t eat ham (he brought over horseradish mashed potatoes, good thing I don\u2019t like horseradish, but he did the right thing), and the steak was tougher than expected. We did also order Mac and cheese and that was the best thing of the night. For $10, it was a huge portion of mac plus it was my favorite pasta shape, shells. To end off the night, we had cheesecake and key lime pie and they were two full sized pieces even though they were the third course of the $44 dollar price fixed meal. The desserts were great. Although we didn\u2019t love the steak, the price fixed meal is definitely the way to go.",

He did send some home with and he's right-quite unpleasant) The atmosphere was clean, classy and well maintained. Our drinks we're good. Our service was-meh. Our server was engaging and had a good personality for the service industry. BUT the service was not fine dining. I have 24 years in fine dining My observations: The hostess was sloppy. She was wearing black leggings and dirty flats. She had a thin gray yoga t-shirt on and a sloppy cardigan over it. No make-up. She looked like she rolled out of bed. Her hair was unkempt and sloppy. And she was no welcoming or pleasant. Maybe she was having a bad day? You still have to at least put in an effort if you plan to work in the service industry. When I made my reservation, I specified that this was my husband's birthday and we had a sitter and would like a quiet table. She seated us in the middle of the restaurant, literally at a 4top. Like I said, our server was a nice guy. But he's not a fine dining server. Or maybe he just needs a little tweaking. He delivered our drinks and I had to wipe the outside of my glass because someone had spilled it down the outside of the glass. I put my dirty butter knife on my appetizer plate and he took it off and left it on the table for me to use again. Etiquette says he should remove all dirty flatware before the next course. I ran out of water, twice. My husband requested the course menu, he dropped it on the table instead of handing to him-my husband was taking a drink. See above asparagus incident. And he never offered us another drink. We decided to go somewhere else for coffee. The steak and calamari are amazing. My chicken was awesome. But I expected more in the way of service. If you're going to spend $150+ on dinner, you should have excellent service.",

Parking is simple, garage across the street, and for lazy people like me, there's a valet right in front of restaurant. Although food was good, what set Sullivan apart was the service. The entire staff was courteous and attentive, to all our needs. With 2 boys(19,16) had a few needs. However, I've eaten many of the best restaurant in the U.S., never had a server as good as our waiter that night. He had 3 or 4 tables, but made the boys and I feel like we were the only customers in the building.",

When telling the manger he agreed to take them off the bill but by the time we were ready to go it took them 1 hour to split the checks and correct  their mistakes with billing  by this time it was 12 am and the manger he became really irate and cussed out waiter out who indeed did nothing wrong.  Perks: Clean, Waiter were nice, & Valet Parking Flaws: Food was dry, Manger had nasty attitude, The wait for a table was an 1 hr even tho we reserved",

We had a table of 11 and maybe it was too much for her? Slow service, some food items were forgotten. An order of crab legs was served without a crab cracker, we asked for a cracker and they brought out a pack of saltines. 2 people sitting next to each other ordered the same exact steak, prepared the same way (Medium Rare). 1 was brought out just about perfect.....the other one was so over cooked the shoes I was wearing were softer. Food was not brought out all together so it seemed like we were eating in shifts. In fairness to the manager he did knock the bill down substantially.....it was just a horrible experience after waiting a year to come back here. I am not sure if we will come back next year when we make our annual visit to Baltimore. 11/2017",
