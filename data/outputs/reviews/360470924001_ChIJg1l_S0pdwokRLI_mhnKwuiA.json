I always order from this location off of doordash. Keep in mind i am allergic to lettuce and tomatoes. I always get a Nacho Doritos Taco and and Crunchwrap Supreme. Both of these with extra beef sour cream and cheese. NOTHING ELSE. One day they put tomatoes and lettuce in my taco and i almost had an allergic reaction if i hadn\u2019t noticed the piece of lettuce in my crunchwrap. I always find their is an issue with my order. I always get broken tacos , someone else\u2019s order, or there is something missing. I keep trying to give this location a chance but yesterday was the last straw. I went to eat my crunchwrap and found that it was a lot of beans and sour cream inside and a broken taco with cheese and beef in it. Doordash continues to not resolve the issue so I will just never be ordering from here ever again.",
