We ordered in advance, showed up a little early and are so happy we did. There was a couple having a picnic in the parking lot and the woman working the lot was checking on them while she answered questions from other customers about the GORGEOUS tree in the middle of their lawn, if they were planning on opening the dining room and if they ever took a break. I found out after talking to her myself that she and her husband are the owners. We can see why our friends love this place so much. The food is AMAZING, the owners are AMAZING and they make us want to come back without even having set foot inside their beautiful building. Well done Lucca!  We look forward to many delicious meals in years to come.",

Even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was great and the food was even better. We had both the Focaccia (as an appetizer) and Prosciutto Pizza which had a Thin and Crispy crust. True Italian style. Even our very picky 5 year old enjoyed the pizza! Not quite as good as Antico in Alpharetta but much less crowded and more of a family friendly environment. Our only complaint was the parking was hard to come by around the restaurant.",

The inside is one large area with communal tables and bench seating. You order at the counter just inside the main entrance.  A menu board would have made deciding what to order easier as apposed to the printed menus on the counter . We didn't know what they served until we got to the counter. If it had been busier the extra time ordering would be an issue. We odered the Meatball appetizer and a Margarita Pizza. We paid at that time and I left a tip but it wasn't clesr who I was tipping , the food runner/ busser , the order taker, the cook or the owner ? The Meatball appetizer consisted of 3 meatballs in marinara and some shaved parmesan and two pieces of bread . It was good but nothing special. The pizza was brought to us by the runner in just a few minutes . The pies are baked in wood ovens like those from Naples ( which these may be , I'm not sure). The high temperature means the cook time is very quick however our pie was not cooked through.  The dough was still a little raw in spots where it was thicker and there was no color to the bottom of the thin crust. The sauce was kinda watery and the small amount of cheese slid  around if you weren't careful. Taste was very good though. If we return ( which may not happen due  to the nearly 20 mile ride from home ) we would ask them to be sure to cook the pizza better. There  have been several of the Neapolitan style pizza places opening in the Atlanta area, Antico being my favorite and Fuscos in Acworth is very close for us and very good. Overall,  Lucca is good but a little short of great . I feel that if the pie had been cooked better the whole experience would have been better. UPDATE: 09/29/19  came back and we're glad we did . Pizza was great and we are very happy. Much improved since first visit",

Was  not greeted by any of the nine employees present, including the owners.  Confusing ordering process, likened to a fast food establishment.   Atmosphere in dining area, well it just wasn't there.  Picnic tables and sparse d\u00e9cor (okie dokie). Paid $30.00 for a pizza, a glass of water, and a $3.50 plastic bottle of tea.  Ordered a Greek salad,  never made it to the table.  Owner came out and told me it was not on my ticket. (alrighty then.)  Pizza came very fast with sparse ingredients , crust not done and very chewy.  Ate  on two aluminum pans,  which I presumed are also used to house the small pizzas.  Asked waiter for utensils , napkins, and  a pizza spatula.   I was  told they were inside and they did not use spatula's there.  (alrighty then)  Utensils were located on a table inside housed in two dishwasher holders.  Literally being touched by everyone who has boldly gone before you.  (Have been in the business, Health Department situation.)  Also asked for napkins and was handed a roll of towels that were bathroom hand towels.   I'm going to stop here because I am not angry, rather disappointed.  I support local business when I can, and truthfully drove 26.5 miles to visit Pizzeria  Lucca.  I give it one star for being over rated, over priced, and very disappointing.  To the owners, this is a tough business to be in,  I know, but if you're going to do it, then do it right.  One day you will run out of friends and family to write good things about you.  By the way , those are beautiful pizza ovens.",

They have condiments for the pizza too, ask about the spicy Lucca sauce. The salads are very fresh and the appetizers are a great size to share. The Meatball Marinara appetizer goes quickly so if they have it, GET IT!! Best thing is everything comes out so quickly! Each time I come in it gets better and better...trendy decor, local beers, and the list goes on! Lucca is family owned and run, they do an amazing job!! Diana and Vic have put everything they have into making the experience at Lucca exceptional. I don\u2019t think there will ever be a day I stop coming into Lucca. This is a great place to bring family and friends whether you are locals or from out of town. Lucca will make you feel at home with a great atmosphere and delicious food!",

Lucca provides quality products (dough, sauce, cheese, toppings, olive oil) on pizza and it is that combination which makes their pizza stand out from their competitors. I love supporting local food places and Lucca\u2019s pizza has not disappointed me ever. I love their consistency in services, quality, pizza taste, garlic bread, and clean ambience! What else would you look for in a pizzeria? Lucca has everything you are looking for! Highly recommend this place.",

Cheap comes to mind. The ingredients seem good, but the extras are just lacking. I find them to be rude and very curt. I just went to read some of the reviews. What a joke, small and pathetic person who fights with customer reviews. There's a pattern that this guy is super rude and especially about children. I didn't have children with me when I went in awhile ago, help me if I did. He, also, commented that he/she was at a funeral all week on one review. The reviewer never said once when they went in. My review is based over a month ago in experience. New flash, owner, reviews can be at any time. For me, I never write them close to my visit. My time is ljmited. Customer service is not consistent and it feels like they are doing you a favor. They are not. I'll spend my dining dollars elsewhere. They don't seem to care about winning my money anyway.",

If you are confident in your confident in your behavior and your product you should not have to defend yourself so strongly, post private information on an employee, and place blame on them for reviews. I recently treated my mother to a special evening at Lucca's. We notice it everyday en route and finally decided to go and check it out. Upon entrance the employees we encountered made eye contact, were smiling and I felt they were sincerely polite and appreciative. The employees in kitchen did a fantastic job, pizza was delicious and I loved the variety and array of Italian toppings. My husbands family is from Sicily and this pizza is fresh, cooked exactly right. However I noticed a man, I assume he was manager or owner, who seemed very agitated with a table close to us that had 2 kids with them. You could feel the tension in the room, especially after I noticed how he spoke to the woman about her children. He was very icy in his demeanor towards her and children when the about 7yr old made a small outburst.  I agree you should maintain your children in a nice place, but sometimes something may just happen. Me and my husband and family have always owned successful businesses, and I have to say I have never myself, nor have I observed an owner write responses to comments in such a defensive manner when customers are simply relaying their experience. It is as if your are demeaning their viewpoint, and that is what a review is. I have no affiliation or know this person who was fired, but I can imagine how I would feel if this was done to me. You should have been professional and had no response publicly or a public reaction and handle it properly.",

However, we were able to overlook the prices because the pizza is good, it\u2019s closer than Antico and it has a family friendly atmosphere. However, our last experience was not a good one. As we were about to leave, my son and our friend\u2019s son, stood up to play for no more than 30 seconds next to our table as we were packing up to leave. They were not doing anything wrong, just being kids, but unknowingly were in the path of the pizza runners. I noticed and was about to move them but before I could, the owner jumped in and made a rude comment to them/us. Based off of other reviews, this seems to be a common thread - a very low tolerance for kids in the restaurant. We felt unwelcome at that point and left quickly however not before spending over $70 for 2 small pizzas, a few beers and a salad. I felt a little robbed and a little offended at the same time. We take our kids out to eat often and have never seen a business owner act unprofessional like that. Furthermore, Lucca is a casual pizza place, albeit an expensive one, with picnic tables, rolls of paper towels on the table and no servers other than people dropping off their overpriced pizza. It is not a fine dining restaurant. Therefore, I would expect them to have a more hospitable approach to interacting with families with kids. Next time we\u2019ll just go to Antico.",

Maybe about 10 minutes from when we ordered to when it came to the table. You can see them cooking it right there in the brick ovens in one side of the restaurant. It's a big open hall-style room with long picnic tables so you can eat family-style. You come in and order at front counter, and then take your order number to your table and then they bring it out to you. The music was a little bit loud, but since it wasn't too busy we were able to hear each other easily. The parking was convenient and ample. Some people said it was expensive in the reviews. We paid $38 for a large pizza, an appetizer, and one drink. That fed me, my husband, and my toddler. I don't think that seems too bad to feed all three of us for 38 bucks.",

I hate to give it one star as the food has always been delicious and the staff is so kind minus the owner ( Vick?) . He yelled at my children and myself tonight as we were leaving and they were running to the door . I was asking them to stop running but he took it to the next level. As a business owner myself,  I am shocked at his Behavior. This is a casual pizza joint swarmed with families . Maybe he is having a bad night but to disrespect anyone like this really shows his lack of professionalism. If I am mistaken please correct me but I am pretty sure he is the owner . Salt and pepper hair and he is always working in the back making pizza . I think his wife works there too and she has always been one of the kindest people I\u2019ve met which is why we come back every week and tell our friends. The rest of the staff I would give 100 stars to and he is lucky he has team that makes up for what he lacks.   Really bad experience and we won\u2019t be coming back which I\u2019m sure Vick will be happy about since that is.what he told me when I was walking out the door, to not come back . Perhaps take another career path in a cubicle where you don\u2019t have to interact with small children . Trust me, they were disciplined for running. There was no need to yell at your customers. Do not bring your kids here . Try fickle pickle on canton street!!",

Some Reviews say best pizza in town, I\u2019d disagree, Antico is still the best Neapolitan style pizzeria in the city.  Service- Make sure when the lady upfront repeats back your order- you hear it CORRECTLY, because if she entered it wrong, it\u2019s now on you that you didn\u2019t catch her mistake and got the wrong pizza. Zero accountability, very rude, and honestly, because of her we lost desire to Ever come back. That\u2019s unfortunate.  Atmosphere- more like eat and go. Good concept with community tables but I can\u2019t put my finger on where it falls short. Maybe 6-8 person tables, white walls, unfriendly cashier. I think there would be potential if the place would just buzz with fun and ease. It was just dull. Grey. Barely friendly. For the price point, nah.",

I noticed this  restaurant closed at 9pm EST, and I was about to go to another store, and I decided to call, and the young lady placed me on hold, after I told her, \" i know you close at 9, but I wanted to go to a local business and I need THIRTY PIZZAS, do you mind asking the owner if they mind staying open to fulfill this order\"... She placed me on hold, and came back with the owner's permission to stay open and make the 30 pizzas for us!! THIS IS WHY I LOVE LOCAL BUSINESSES!!!! Thank you Vic and Diana..I will be back!!!!",

For my family, we'll keep enjoying some of the best pizza that we've ever had at Pizzeria Lucca.  We're in there every week.  Owners and staff are very pleasant and accommodating.  Pricing is a little higher than what we've been used to paying but we truly get what we pay for.   We've tried others in the Roswell/Alpharetta area and cannot find ANYTHING that competes (most have been very disappointing).  Congrats to Pizzeria Lucca on an excellent product!  #WyWySTRONG",

He was afraid they were disturbing the other 5 families in the dining room, all of whom were preschool parents and part of the group we were joining! By the way, that evening was our preschool's spirit night, and we were there at the invitation of the owner!  We were so put off by his awful behavior we left without ordering.",

Pizzeria Lucca, while highly recommended by friends was a bit of a disappointment for me. As seen in the picture, the pizza pie looks great but when you hold a slice and get a drastic flop like the one in the other picture, I knew it was gonna be a bust.  Whoever made the pizza seriously undercooked it.  Granted, the soggy crust may have been partially due to ordering this pizza to go and it sitting in the box in my trunk for 15 minutes. The pizza has major potential, nice thin crust, good cheese and sauce. I could see this being good if it were cooked longer.  Next time I'll eat inside the restaurant and give it one more shot. I'm hoping it was just an off day for whoever made this pizza.  *update* went here on Saturday  9/8 and ate inside. As I predicted, pizza looks great and has good taste but dough is extremely soggy. I will not be returning. I'm also convinced that people in Georgia dont know good pizza and that is why this place gets such high reviews. Take it from a new Yorker who is a harsh critic that this pizza isnt worth your time. When you hold a slice up and it flops (sags) it isnt gonna be good. Pizza needs to be crispy not soggy. And that's a review folks.",

It\u2019s simply brilliant Pizza and more importantly, authentic Brooklyn style. Just the right sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil and the perfect crust. I go there every week and so happy to have this in my neighborhood.  I would highly recommend Luca. The ambience is non pretentious, very social and the owners are always out there taking care of customers and making sure the quality is perfect.  We need more places like these in Atlanta/ Roswell. I hesitated to give this review since I wanted it to be a local secret, but too late ! I think everyone who eats there is touched by its awesomeness ...",

They have beer and wine options. And a water and ice maker machine for self service.  We built our own margarita pizza.  The sauce was on point and the dough wonderfully chewy but also still crunchy.  And not too much dough. It was a nice light dough on the thinner crust side, which I prefer.  Meats were good.

The main room is as big as a warehouse, but it's ringed with counters and hanging signs that give it the look and feel of a local deli, and the long, heavy boardinghouse benches add a real down-home touch, like you would find in a big BBQ joint. Lots of people were eating on the patio, but we preferred to sit next to the three ovens, looming large in plain view. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. But it's all about the pizza, gang, and they do it very nicely. The star of the show is the crust. It comes out of the oven amazingly quickly--and the wood-fired heat makes it bubbly and airy on top and nicely marked and smoky on the bottom without being charred. The sauce is simple and tasty and you get enough of it--something that is becoming a real issue at so many other places trying to cut corners. P-L offers a good number of house pies and a decent selection of toppings if you prefer to build your own. We found the prices to be just right, compared with the other pizzerias around that go for quality over mass-production. Very good experience. We will be back!    (Previous reviews suggesting one drives down Mimosa, then turning right on Bulloch Ave are giving a great tip.)",

You can get full and out the door for $10-12 a person which feels increasingly rare these days. When I feel like neopolitan pizza, this is where I end up.  Edit: Owner takes an active interest in the success of the business, edited from 4 to 5 stars. Not every restaurant is going to be perfect for everyone.

My husband and I typically have a date night weekly here while our daughter has a 90 minute kids program near our neighborhood.  We've been coming since it opened and every single time we have had excellent pizza, delicious salads, friendly staff and very fast service. We have brought many friends and family here and everyone has been thrilled. All the salads are good and more than enough unless you're the 6'5\" dude who apparently needs 15 meatballs to be happy.  We've tired several different pizzas, all have been terrific. The owners, Vic and Diana, who we did not know before coming to Lucca, are WONDERFUL. I say that because we actually speak to them when we come to their restaurant. We've gotten to know them a little bit over the past (almost) two years. They love what they do, work incredibly hard to provide the best service and truly desire that people love their food. It is high time I posted a review so here I am and I just read the reviews. Bless you Pizzeria Lucca for feeding people. Seriously. Now it is time for me to review some of the reviewers: *Dear Kelsey, You could have ordered a small pizza, or two small pizzas. In one of our many chitty chars with the owner (because he is actually a person you can talk to) mentioned to us that they had run out of dough and they were just as surprised because they were slammed that day. Antico dude has a sign on his door that says will make pizza until he runs out of dough and every thinks he is a genius. *Dear Alicia who has never been to the restaurant and is basing her review of a reviewer she never met (insert all hysterical laughing emojis here...) There are sooooooooo many pizza places around. Tru dat. But there aren't sooooooooo many really really good pizza places around. You should try this place and then rescind your review. Indeed food reviews are hilarious. Yours is too. If I was you I'd want to be me too. *Dear Mihai, I have never expected any restaurant to provide a cup for my two year old. That is what a sippy cup if for. *Dear Dominic, Appetizers come in threes. It is a thing. Please pass the knife.  *Dear Lucca Staff, Thank you for being you. We love the food. And if we don't we tell it to your face. But we'd be nice about it : )))))))))))))))))))))))))))",

On the way I decided to read a few reviews, mostly because I find them to be hilarious. My first job was at a restaurant and geez do people enjoy complaining! However, to my surprise I was appalled! Not by the reviews but from the response from the owner! I mean yes, people complain but to respond by telling them to enjoy eating somewhere else and essentially blaming everybody else without taking any responsibility EVER!? I get defending your business to the extend of saying I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your experience. As the owner, playing the blame game presives you as incredibly ridiculous. Take the high road every once in a while. Unfortunately this bothered me to the point we decided to spend our money elsewhere I'm sure this was our loss. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how great your establishment is, if you continue to treat customers in this way you'll eventually run of out of customers!

Large white picnic tables with benches fill this Dining Room. In great weather, there are  outside screened tables. Lioht rock croons in the background serenely. Great place for children of all ages. Upon arriving, part of your group can go find a table and the rest can stand and order. You do get a number stand, so they can bring your delectable ooey gooey pizzas to your table. You. Deliver the metal personal pizza size plates to your table. They have plenty of staff to help with the drinks. As a real treat, you can watch them pump out the pizza in fire wall ovens imported from Italy. We ordered 3 pies, with extra lunch slices. So good. The sauce is awesome, the crust is wonderful.  I usually give the Hubs my crust, but not at LUCCA'S  !! Sausage was spicy as promised with fresh lumps of  mozzarella and basil. Cheese pizza with onions -who la la ! Imported and IPA beers and Wine are easily purchased. Pink lemonade for the Kids ! You can even order desert, if you can ! Great place . Good  Food, Efficient Staff, Clean Bathrooms and and about approximately  $10.00 +-  per person for the Best Pizza.  Handicapped entrance, ample parking, Honors debit/credit cards.

        "caption": "I can\u2019t believe all of the 5 star ratings for this place, maybe I went on an off day. I had really high hopes for Pizza Lucca, I saw that all of the ingredients were fresh and looked very good and that they were using wood burning ovens. Then it all went downhill, we ordered a NY Cheese and a Lucca and 3 drinks and it was just under $50.00. This is outrageous for pizza for lunch. This just isn\u2019t for Pizza Lucca but almost every pizza place around Atlanta, you all overcharge for pizza like I have never seen before. I\u2019m from Philadelphia and I have worked in several pizza & sandwich shops. It\u2019s a rite of passage for Philadelphians. I couldn\u2019t spend this much on good pizza if I tried. I don\u2019t get you people from Atlanta. You gladly overpay for mediocre pizza all the time. A good large cheese pizza is $12 or less, no questions asked. This allows for quality ingredients and a profit for the owner. Any place that tells you that they have to charge more because of the costs is a bad business manager, a liar or just likes to gouge their customers. The Lucca pie should be priced at $18. Getting back to pizza Lucca, we received the two pies that we ordered and they looked odd. The crust ring was burnt in spots, not charred but burnt and in-between the burnt crust the crust was an odd color of whitish yellowish dough. The crust\u2019s taste was very off putting. My daughter who loves to eat pizza crust wouldn\u2019t touch it. When I went to pick up a slice, it just flopped. The base crust was soupy, limp and wet. When you pick up a slice and fold it in half it should be able to stay folded and hold it\u2019s toppings without drooping and having the toppings slide out. The ingredients used were of very high quality and very tasty but the dough and the way it was cooked was just bad. We are always in search of good pizza that is reasonably priced in the North suburbs and boy were we disappointed with Pizza Lucca. As we were leaving the owner asked us what we thought of their pizza and not wanting to tell the truth I told him we thought it was awful, the crust was wet and soupy and he told me that is how good Neapolitan pizza was made. When I disagreed he got upset with me. We took the remaining pizza home thinking that reheating it on our pizza stone might save it a little but my daughter refused to eat it because of how bad it tasted earlier at lunch and my wife convinced me to just throw it away and chalk it up to just another overpriced bad pizza place in the Atlanta suburbs. I looked up a pizza place that when I was a kid we would got to for lunch during high school. A large 18 inch sausage pizza that would blow any place in Atlanta way was $14.75. The same meal at this place that would leave you begging for more would have cost me $32.55 plus tax. I asked my daughter and wife if they would give it another try as maybe we went on an off day and they both said not a chance, it was just too bad and expensive the first time. In response to the owner, this conversation did happen. I was there with my family after my daughter\u2019s soccer game on 9/23/17 and we spent $45.26. Maybe it didn\u2019t happen in your head because someone called you out on your soggy wet droopy pizza and you didn\u2019t want to hear it. Maybe this will spark your memory. When I told you it was bad, I picked up a slice top show you how soggy wet droopy it was and that REAL pizza, when bent in half should never flop.",
