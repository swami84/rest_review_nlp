From the mini cheesesteaks to the plain pretzels, everything is fresh and amazing. So much flavor in the dipping sauces, this place is such a guilty pleasure. My one wish is that there were more of these places with more business and later hours. I think this is an underrated gem and needs to be highlighted. I recommend this place to everyone in the U.S. no exaggeration.",

Wonderfully packaged, the savory aroma of 25 freshly baked pretzels is hard to pass up.  Dont forget to indulge in their many dips.  I went with the Nacho and Melted Cheddar.  Both very good.",
