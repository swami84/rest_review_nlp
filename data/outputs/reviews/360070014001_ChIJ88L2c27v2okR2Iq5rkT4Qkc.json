And the restaurant itself and atmosphere is so nice. It\u2019s my favorite spot in the area. I am bummed though that they don't have Miso Soup which is a Japanese/sushi staple or a Poke Bowl which is my new obsession. Maybe one day they'll add them!",

The only veggies I found was scallions and a few pieces of onion. No bean sprout, no peanuts, but a piece of plastic that somehow was in there. I probably would never order from here again.",

I ordered take out via eatstreet.com on Aug 23rd, the first weekend the University students were back, and it was so busy. The front person was constantly going. She told me they were making my order. I waited. She asked my name again. It's getting made now... The front area was full of complaining people waiting too long for orders. Clearly under staffed. An HOUR went by. I wanted to cancel after 30 minutes but my husband said we waited this long and our credit card had already been charged. So an hour after it was supposed to be ready for pick up she listens when taking my name- she has no record of my order. Obviously, I'm frustrated. I try to cancel, she insists they'll make it immediately, it'll be ready in 10 minutes. It was. It was delicious, but not worth the hassle. Sept 15 I was craving the Pineapple Curry for lunch, so I gave them a second try. My order was ready in 20 minutes. I have yet to learn which is the norm.",

Ordered, Green Curry, Spicy Fried Rice, Drunken Noodles, Spring Rolls and Lava Ice Cream. That Tea is a must try (high in Sugars though).  ********* Driving from Philly to Niagara Falls, craving for Thai food, wanted something close to Hwy 81 with good ratings... Thai Time appeared small shop from out side but it's a full service restaurant with great authentic menu and good hearted servers.  We ordered Spicy Thai Fried Rice (9/10), Dragon Noodles(10/10), Green Curry(10/10) and Sauted Veg platter (9/10).  Fried Ice Cream for dessert is exceptionally good.  Overall, it was a great experience with awesome ambiance, good taste, quality of service. All this for under $75 for 4 people!  Even if we don't go there again (I wish we do), this will be our one of best restaurants, highly recommend!",

We were seated and all were ready to order with no sight of our waiter for at least 10 minutes so we called the host over to send the waiter.

When talking to the manager, he seemed very nice and receptive and I was very happy with everything he said the party package would include, but when the day came, things started to go wrong from the very first minute.  First of all, the place was not clean, there were not enough seats for all the people that were coming, and the floors were sticky and dirty. Also, I sent the manager the guest list first thing in the morning, but when I got there, my guests were just waiting around and could not begin ordering drinks or eating the food because they didn't have such guest list that I provided, because the manager apparently never communicated with the staff. So I had to pull the guest list from my phone and the party started later than expected.  Then, they took forever to make the food. The manager told me that the food would be provided and refilled during a two hour period, but this did not happen. One of the dishes did not come up until about an hour later, and my guests were just waiting around and hungry. The little food that did come out finished very quickly since there were more than 40 people, and I had to get on the phone multiple times and argue with the manager (who very conveniently was not there) to get more food. So for most of the party, there was nothing to eat. Also, there was only one bar tender and it took a long time for people to get drinks.  The manager was extremely rude each time I talked to him on the phone, I am sure I was annoying, I admit I called him many times, but I did this because I wanted to get the service that was promised and that I paid for.  And then after the party is over and everyone is gone, the manager has the nerve to call me telling me that I had not paid, but of course I had, it's the very first thing I did that morning right after I sent him the guest list. Overall it was evident that, even though I had set the date of the party more than 3 weeks in advance, they were not prepared at all to host it, it almost seemed like the manager did not tell his staff there was going to be a party, and of course, the staff were as frustated and angry as I was, and even though some of them were extremely rude to me, I don't blame them. It's not their fault that the manager did not prepare them and gave them the right instructions (I mean he didn't even give them the guest list) to prepare the food the way he promised it would be done.  Anyways, don't waste your money for a party here. Their food is great, but their party planning services are not.",

Prices aren't any better than Nhu Y's I don't think, so just go there instead for slightly more authentic and certainly higher-quality pho.

The hostess didn't acknowledge us when we first arrived. We politely stood off to the side because we were waiting for our friend to park their car. Once they arrived we moved in front of the hostess to show we were ready to be seated and she still wouldn't acknowledge us until we physically went up to her and got her attention. There was nobody else waiting. They didn't have a table ready for a party as big as ours yet (6 people) so we sat at the bar to wait. I watched as they sat some other smaller groups. Eventually I noticed they sat a party of 5 at a big table and then a party of 8. I asked the bartender politely if we were going to be seated soon. She gave me attitude and said \"I'm sure they didn't forget about you\" but then she went and asked the hostess and suddenly someone came out to seat us. Seems to me like they forgot about us. I was looking forward to sitting outside because it was a beautiful summer night and their outdoor seating overlooks the river. They put us in the back corner under the stairs and we were eaten up by mosquitos all night. The food was dry and the drinks were mediocre for the price. I was so disappointed because it was such a different experience from the last time I went. A few months later my family wanted to order food from them and I decided to give the food another chance since it was good the first time. It was so dry and barely had any flavor. My family all agreed. I don't know if there was a change in management or if whoever cooks the food was replaced but I will never go back. So disappointed. It really is a cute little place and the outdoor seating is beautiful. But the food and the service is lacking for sure and I'm really disappointed that I had such a bad experience, especially after telling my friends how great the place was and especially because it was my birthday.",

The service was adequate and the waitress was nice and did a great job, despite the fact that it was busy at the bar and the floor tables, inside & out. My only advice is that the unagi don, although great (the eel, seaweed salad & cucumber) the rice on the bottom of the dish/bowl was too much on the unagi don. I would have rather just had the rolls for $8 instead of $15 for the unagi don, had I known the bottom was a rice plantation, literally! Tone it down on the rice on the bottom of the bowl. Other than that, great tasting dishes.  Oh, & they DON'T take Amex cards. C'mon, as a business in downtown at a time when we're soon going competely cashless, work on accepting all major cards. I know Amex fees can be daunting but the benefits outweigh those costs. You get a 4star because despite my dislikings mentioned here, the service I received was good, friendly & prompt!.",

The entrees and noodle dishes don't have much of a taste or flavor, and the spice level is inconsistent. I find the food here to be underwhelming, with the exception of the curry puffs (though I'm not sure if those are made in house). I was prompted to write this review when the last order I received was so spicy that it was inedible. They have a spice level system for ordering that is 1 - 10, with 10 being the hottest. Because of my previous experience ordering 3, 4, 5, and 6 \"stars\" of spiciness and receiving underspiced dishes each time, I decided to order an 8/10, and it was absolutely loaded with a handful of red pepper flakes. This tells me that they do not have a real spice level system in place, and also that they don't know how to make a dish spicy and flavorful. I would not recommend going here because you never know what you will get, and because the taste of the food is just not that great and rather bland.",

I had 2 of the people with me taste it because they like spicy.  Both stated it was VERY spicy. I advised the waiter and he said he could give me some limes to \"tone down\" the heat. I asked him to check with the kitchen.and he said they assured him it was a one. I tried to eat it but the \"burn\" was too much.  He came by and I said I can not eat this. He said sorry took it and brought it out in a take home container. He also did not offer to take anything off bill. The last time.there,.they messed up our order and the service was very slow.

They use chicken broth in everything (including items that use the term \"vegetarian\" in their description). Their wait staff has been known to regularly misinform people that their dishes are vegetarian when they are not. Different wait staff will give different information. It has been confirmed with the cook and owners that there is nothing (minus the sushi without sauce) that is truly vegetarian. Horrible place that should not have your trust. If you have allergies to food I would also suggest staying away from it since they cannot be trusted to give accurate information about what they serve.",
