I also appreciated how clearly diet restrictions were labeled on the menu (vegan, gluten-free, etc). Our gyoza was delicious! My only complaint is the ramen. It was WAY too oily. And not even that flavorful. I ordered extra noodles, which made the flavor issue worse. It came on the side in a cup, and the noodles had partially congealed together. Before the pandemic their ramen was always top notch, and I would have given them 5 stars. I hope they get back to where they were before.",

In fact, you don't even enter the establishment to order, they have an order center set up outside as well. All bowls and cutlery are disposable, but quality and recyclable disposable. We had three varieties of ramen and all were outstanding, although I prefer the smooth, rich flavor of Tonkatsu, which was my favorite. The regular order size is quite large and could be shared. The smaller portion is perfect for one. The house made kimchi was crunchy, saucy and umami-rich, I recommend that as well. We will be going back for sure.",

I have heard and read how truly amazing Crane Ramen was I needed to try it for myself. I was looking for a chicken or seafood ramen, I don't eat pork or beef and wanted it with a heavy miso broth. Since today was my freedom party, I didn't care if it had pork or beef broth I just didn't want the meat to be of that persuasion. I drove there and spoke one-on-one with the host/server and she was extremely helpful and helped me make a selection based upon what she thought I wanted (she had about 12 tables, was juggling to go orders on the phone and walk-up Togo orders) She was doing an amazing job as I am a bartender myself. I have to say I was a little disappointed in the soup. The broth was dark but light in flavor and did not have much substance. No miso, the chicken was bland and overcooked, especially being dark meat (kind of hard to do), and the corn displayed in the photo looked as if it was on the cob or at least shucked off the cob, and this looked like it was canned. The egg was delicious, bok choy okay, but just felt like it was missing so much! Flavor, me too, mushrooms, don't know. I've just heard so much hype about this place and as I sit here in my living room eating my soup, unfortunately I'm disappointed. I never like to give reviews like this ever ever. As I read the other reviews, everybody seems to think this is the best restaurant in the world so I'm thinking perhaps I might have had a bad experience. I certainly hope so. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dish for what my liking was. I did ask for guidance and explained in detail what I was looking for and craving. So somewhere along the line something was lost and translation or perhaps this is just not the soup for me. I will definitely give them another chance since they are the talk of the town, but at $15 a pop, it's kind of hard to take a risk,again, if you were told this was the soup with the most flavor.. and it just not seem to be cutting it for even subtle flavor. I even added the normal things that I add to pho/ramen, and it did not cut the mustard. Perhaps I need to add mustard LOL JK. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing....I hope so.",

The Bao bun and the veggies (in the bun and the ramen) were all great, very fresh. The broth in both ramens was awesome, comparable to some of the best ramen places in Chicago, Atlanta, etc (was pleasantly surprised). Unfortunately, the meat in all 3 dishes held it back a bit. The pork belly, pork chasu, and pulled pork had flavors that were just okay (?under marinated) and definitely could have use a bit more char/browning. Maybe it's just the way they do pork? Either way, I'm pretty sure the ramen would be great if you got a vegan/vegetarian option.  I'm a little dumbfounded about how you can make such wonderful broth (which is the hard part, in my mind), go through the trouble to have great fresh vegetables, but miss the mark so much in regards to the meat! I will add that the Ramen egg probably would have benefitted from being marinated a bit longer, but was okay as is. I really want to like this place and look forward to trying it again - something non-pork probably.",

The Tofu Buns were like biting into a soft, pillowy cloud and were equally enjoyable. There was an order of Kimchi Brussel Sprouts too with kimchi puree on the side. With or without the sauce, the aggressively roasted brussel sprouts were an enjoyable side. So why 4 stars? First time eating here and there are other items in the menu yet to be tried.

The prices (the ramen were $12 - $14) were appropriate for the quality & portion sizes (except for the kara-age chicken appetizer, which was a bit stingy). The servers were efficient and very engaged. They were friendly, but not intrusive...just right. The ramen broths were all excellent (my tonkotsu was very rich and delicious), and the noodles had that springy bite that is indicative of quality Japanese noodles. Also, the ajitsuke tamago were at that perfect sweet spot between soft- & hard-boiled, where the yolks are pleasantly creamy. We especially enjoyed the gyoza, which were properly well-crisped on just the one side, and had a delicious filling. One member of our party disliked ramen, and there were several other options on the menu that pleased her, including the Hiyashi Chuka, a cold noodle dish with s ginger dressing. There are lots of vegetarian options, as well, We were there for an early dinner, but I could see that their small dining room filled up fast, and they don't do reservations, so expect a brief wait. Personally, I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

Def on the spicy side, which is my favorite. It was amazing. Happy to see the curry option being added to their expanding menu. The regular miso vegetable ramen (also vegan) is good, just subtle on the flavor front. I\u2019m satisfied with the service. All of the servers, bartenders and kitchen staff seem experienced and like they work well together. The bathroom is shared with the neighbor restaurant. Clean-ish bathroom. So excited for the extension to the menu! As always, this is one of my go to places for drinks. Great place for dinner. Great place for happy hour! Great place to bring out of town visitors.",

The crab that came with it was good, but there was literally two bites worth of that, and that was it for the meat. I\u2019m allergic to mushrooms, they still sent them on the side, which was about the only thing we appreciated because my girlfriend loves mushrooms.

I\u2019d only heard about the authentic ramen trend in recent times, but hadn\u2019t gone looking for it as I was content with my view of ramen being staple college dorm food. Wandering around Gainesville for the weekend, my wife and I literally walked a few blocks looking for something to eat for lunch on a Sunday and found this place.  The first thing we wanted to try was the Gyoza, and it was so perfect it literally melted in our mouths with deliciousness. I don\u2019t think I can ever order pork dumplings at a Chinese takeout place again knowing these exist, they were that good.  As for the ramen, well... just like I told our server (who patiently explained the detailed process of how they cook their 3 main broths)... you had me at snow crab and pork belly. The fresh vegetables, soft boiled egg, texture-perfect noodles and that warm, rich broth all come together for a truly satisfying dining experience.  And then... I tried my wife\u2019s chicken bowl which had ginger in the broth, which I liked even better than my own. As I told my wife about half way through, I could eat this nourishing, delicious food every day. If there\u2019s one place I know for sure we will visit again when in Gainesville, it is definitely Crane Ramen.",

The steamed buns are the best appetizer they have; chicken being my personal favorite. Sapporo on draft? Absolutely!

Upon arriving, I was promptly seated. Their decor and customer service are top notch and passable respectively. I ordered the ramen with chicken in it. (More on why I dont remember the name shortly). The food arrived promptly and the plating was excellent. Starting with the broth (which was a pitiable amount), the food was overwhelming salty and the soy sauce shone as the star flavor. The Vegetables and chicken on top of the ramen had grown cold due to the lack of thermal insulation around it. The egg was like the broth. Salty and lacked any resemblance to it's former incarnation of being an egg. Instead it had been reborn as a soy flavored monstrosity. The noodles were the only reedeming feature of the dish. It retained the flavor of the broth while not being overly strong. Overall, the ramen can only be described as a disappointment. The broth to noodle ratio was so pitiable I had to add water to balance it out and reduce the saltiness. The dish was so unmemorable I don't even remember exactly what it was I ordered. However I will admit that it seemingly tastes very much of what one can expect in America. The umami and saltiness were overwhelming and completely unbalanced as one would expect of the more mild flavored Japanese cuisine. In conclusion, I would come back if not for the high price tag for a dish that seemingly is not deserving of it.",

Internet on the block was down and the wait list was long, but I wanted ramen.  After waiting about an hour and a half, we were seated a small table and we're greeted by our server--I wish I remembered her name (I blame my lapse in memory on drinking a very strong gin drink at a local bar while waiting for our table) but she had blonde hair and wore round glasses with a black/grey tortoise pattern. She was welcoming, patient, warm, hilarious, and intuitive when it came to knowing what to suggest from the menu for us. While ordering appetizers and asking about the ramen, our server made both a recommendation for the spicy ramen and a Pokemon reference. I was sold. She continually checked in on us and was supportive even when we ordered a second round of steamed buns AFTER we had received our ramen. It's rare to find people in hospitality that truly care about other people's experiences but our server was one of them.  The house made kimchi was delightfully pungent with a decent amount of kick. My boyfriend always eats kimchi by itself. I've never had the urge to do so until last night at crane ramen. The steamed buns, one of my favorite treats in the world, were fresh and flavorful. The pork belly was tender, fatty, and it melts in your mouth. I tried to take as many bites as possible to savor it but we still ordered more buns later in the meal because we didn't get enough. My spicy pork ramen was especially satisfying since it was a chilly evening. The broth was perfectly rich and spicy. Our server suggested A yuzu honey ice cream for dessert. Normally, I would not order ice cream at a restaurant but I had yet to be disappointed. The ice cream was an ideal pairing of tartness from yuzu and a smooth, subtle sweetness from the honey. The ice cream had this surprisingly pleasant texture of layers creamy smooth cream juxtaposed with thin sheets of ice.  tl;dr Fantastic service and delicious food!",

The owners response makes me laugh- I do not have  \u201cIM Facebook.\u201d If you want to address the age discrimination at your business, then you should spend more time there and not on Facebook. You can easily reach me if you would like, I live four blocks away. Your attempt to dismiss my negative review without doing anything, besides offering a method of resolve that clearly someone of my age will not use, is laughable.

I was torn between the inviting modern facad that encouraged parties to overstay their visit and the expectation of fast service that ramen is known for that was just not met. While the restaurant itself was decorated quite nicely, it was quite warm inside which made me want to leave asap, especially after eating hot food (with room temperature water). The ramen was okay, I felt that the broth and noodles were fine but the vegetables were cooked very unevenly. Regardless, I thought $12 for a vegetarian bowl is ludicrous to expect, especially with tip. My favorite item was the agadashi tofu steamed bun which was actually quite nice. I do not recommend this place unless you are really that desperate to eat pricey ramen.",

        "caption": "It was probably a mistake to try this restaurant on a Friday night . We arrived at about 8pm  and our 1/2 hour wait turned into an hour.  And, as usual when you're waiting for a table, it seemed others arriving later than us were seated before us...  When we finally got a table, in the front, it was as hot inside as it was out.  Before we sat, the waiter poured out glasses of room-temperature water for our table.  The bottle was classy but we had to ask for ice.  And that was the last time we discussed drinks with our waiter.  He rushed in, took our food order and rushed off.  I don't know that we would have head him though, it was extremely loud in the small space.  Even in such a small restaurant it took a while before we saw him again and by that time we were really just waiting it out in the heat, hoping that the food would live up to its reputation.     Unfortunately, when it arrived 1/ 2 hour later, while it was good it didn't make the wait and poor service worth the while.   We have heard quite a bit of high praise for Crane Ramen  from our friends but the impression I left with is that they are coasting on their initial reputation and aren't putting out the effort they once did.  I am willing to believe that our visit was atypical.  Perhaps the hostess and waiter were having a bad day.  Maybe they were having issues with their air-conditioning and the night's clientele were especially loud talkers.     And the refrigerator they cool their drinking water in was dead.    I would recommend it for the food alone if you catch it at a better time.",

Pork was okay but still pretty meh overall. Came with only half of a soft boiled egg.  Mushrooms seemed like they just put them in raw and were flavorless as well.

They were out of tea of any kind,he \"pork\" gyoza tasted like biting into an onion, the \"buns,\" while tasty, were more like sandwiches, and the tonkotsu bowl was disappointing on several levels. Eggs were cold, and the tiny sliver of \"extra\" pork i ordered seemed like an insult for the price that was paid. The soup wasn't -bad-, just not very impressive, and the prices and reviews led me to believe the meal would be more significant. I took a party of 4 and payed nearly $80 after tip. Too much for me to still be hungry afterwards, in my opinion.  Some pros, though... The interior design was slick for such a tiny space, and the serving staff ga.e a solid performance",

I have been to Japan and was taught how to make ramen there. They didn't even come close. The noddles didn't take in any flavor and the broth had no taste. I was told they didn't serve rice because they focused on Japan comfort food, I'm sorry but there is rice served with just about every meal in Japan. The amount of money I spent on food there would let me make ramen for about 20 people and it would be authentic ramen. You guys missed the mark badly. The only reason I gave them two stars instead of one, was because the chicken steam buns were very good. I'm sorry but I have had better ramen from a Japanese 9 year old, my friends sister in Okinawa Japan.",
