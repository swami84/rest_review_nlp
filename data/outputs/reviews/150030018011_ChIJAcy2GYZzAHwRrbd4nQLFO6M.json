The spicy garlic sauce is absolutely ridiculous and Sam is such a wonderful presence to be around. We will come back to Oahu just for the food here. It was BYOB when we came but we grabbed some beers at the ABC store on the way. If I can recommend anything more than coming to the island of Oahu, it\u2019s this place.",
