The food is inspired by Mediterranean dishes and include yogurt brined chicken, lamb kebab, personal flatbread pizzas, even fried chicken tenders.  Sides vary from grits with tahini and chickpeas, to olive tapenade, baba ghanoush, and pickled vegetables.  The fountain juice drinks are very good and don't contain excessive sugar.  Try the mango pineapple.  You take a menu and then tell the staff what you want to order.  They bring it out on a tray like a dine-in fast food place.  Most areas of the museum forbid food and drink so fuel up either here or at the coffee kiosk across the staircase.  Since this is a museum restaurant in DC, the prices will be higher than normal.  Expect to pay at least $20 per person for lunch and a drink.",
