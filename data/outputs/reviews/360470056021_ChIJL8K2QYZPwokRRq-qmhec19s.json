Forget it as the room we were in was 100% capacity with just some dividers between the tables. But that\u2019s ok we are all tired of covid restrictions  2nd - We booked a birthday for Sat Mar6  event 3 weeks prior. On the morning of party manager called asking if they can move it by 1hr and to outside.. after being told that we can\u2019t move it , as people had made arrangements he relented - what a douchie move!  3rd - party started at 8:15pm and at 11 they told us we have to leave  by \u201cregulations\u201d Seriously Positano NYC? A party next to us was there before us and didn\u2019t seem to be moving out after 11. Furthermore more people came in. As per regulation you are supposed to be 1/3 indoor capacity - did you conveniently  forget that regulation ?  Food: other than fish - food was not tasty, it was just ok Italian dishes - with quantity making up for quality. Ordered Clams for appetizers where most clams were just empty shells.  Which makes me wonder if Positano is recycling eated clams and pouring half for new guests. If you had half self respect for the pricey, fabulous restaurant  you position yourself - you would  never serve half empty clams!  In summary - a very disappointing experience from start to finish  mostly aggravated by disguisting management conduct",

I recently went again with a small group and we sat outside (about 39 degrees out) and the staff did everything possible to accommodate us and keep us warm. They truly went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was positive. (They have those giant propane tower heaters that are very effective at keeping you warm if you prefer to sit outside).",

I believe it also had spinach and sundried tomatoes with a piece of barrata cheese.  My husband had the Marsala which he enjoyed.  The cocktail I had was great it was the chandelier.  The dessert which the waiter recommended, the banana bread pudding to die for.  The chocolate snuggle also awesome.  So no complaints.  The waiters also very personable and attentive.

As it began to downpour, many customers who were not covered by an awning had to put up a fight to be moved, even though there were several empty tables under shelter. My boyfriend and I, however, were quite patient and waited until our lovely waitress pushed to have our table moved under shelter, much to her managers dismay. The manager then proceeded to tell us that he had a party of 5 coming and that when they are to show up, we were going to have to move back to our original seats in the pouring rain. Once again we did not put up a fight, as we were taken aback by his complete disregard for us. Then as we were eating, he had the staff rushing us throughout our meal, making us feel unwelcome. Once again our waitress was incredible and told us to take our time. Although I did not catch your name, thank you for doing the absolute best you could. Your kindness did not go unnoticed. After we were rushed by other staff to have our dinner plates cleared, we asked to see a dessert menu. We could tell this upset the manager. This upset him so much so infact, that he came up to our table and told us that after dessert we were to wrap it up and get a check. There was no apology, there was no compensation, nothing. This treatment is absolutely discusting as we are paying customers who are staying loyal to your restauraunt during a global pandemic. After the treatment we recieved by the manager we will no longer be dining at this restauraunt again, and will be sure to tell our family and friends to do the same. Do better.",

I walked up to the entrance it was around 5pm, there was this guy hanging out at the bar with a drink in his hand , when he saw me waiting he turned around and started talking to the bartender. So while I was waiting for someone to acknowledge me, a waiter at the opposite side of the bar kept calling to the guy with the drink in his hand trying to get his attention. I believe he called him \u201cSal.\u201d After a few minutes Sal finally turned around. He approached me and said yes. I said I\u2019d like a table for 3. He asked if I had a reservation, I said I did not. He said \u201c I can seat you now but you have to be out in an hour.\u201d I said what if we\u2019re a few minutes over. His response was \u201cthen I\u2019ll just drop the check.\u201d  At that moment I said to myself where did they find this winner?  I turned around walked away and went to another restaurant. I didn\u2019t expect a response like that from someone who seemed to be responsible for the front of the house. Sal was very unprofessional.  I would have stayed and made sure I was out in an hour, because I understood that they had reservations coming in, if Sal new how to speak to a customer. Very disappointed.",

It's such a simple oversight on their part. The whole place looks festive and perfect for the evening and family's celebrating together but is thrown wildly off by the TVs glowing with ESPN.",

We asked her politely if she would make another one instead but she made this rude face and would clearly show us she was annoyed! Sorry but you need a new and professional bartender who knows their drinks for the price you charge at this classy restaurant.

A special thanks to the manager Pasquale for being so accommodating and providing such great customer service from the moment that I walked in the door to ask for information. I booked our event that same moment and there was absolutely nothing to regret. Thank you Sergio, Armando, and the rest of the staff that were so friendly, attentive, and professional. There wasn't a glass that wasn't filled or a dish lying around that didn't need to be there. Let me tell you about the food... EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious! From our family style appetizers (meatballs, mozzarella, calamari), the Caesar and house salad, penne vodka, and all of the entrees- all of our guests were shocked that every meal was so perfect. We had a beautiful lunch, we brought our own cake and had a nice little table we were able to decorate ourselves with cupcakes and favors. I cannot thank you guys enough, not a single moment of disappointment. We will definitely return for lunch and dinner, I highly recommend for any private event!",

My first time at Fort Hamilton about five years ago, on a cold day I walked into the restaurant and was greated by a woman, as if we were long lost friends. I was just looking for a meal. I felt welcome and had a very impressive meal. About a year later and I returned with a friend and again had wonderful meals. And tonight about three years later, I returned again alone. The young woman who was taking names and finding seats was new to me but found me a seat on a busy night. She also made me feel very welcome among a crowd of what I expect are regulars. The meal again marvelous, yet it is that personal connection that makes a wonderful meal even more memorable. How do they find people like that? Or, do they teach that to the people? No, I believe that they must have a nack for finding the right person to great and seat and start a wonderful meal off with the guest feeling welcomed and glad to be there.",

        "caption": "Wow. The amount of good reviews on here are shocking. The first time me and my girlfriend came here, we waited an hour to be seated after we were told it was a 25 minute wait. This was after I had called a week in advance to attempt to get a reservation and was told that reservations are not accepted. As I stood there, we were skipped over by another party of two that claimed they had a reservation, and then another party of 3 that arrived after us. By the third time we were skipped I said something and they sat us next. The only thing that saved the experience was a wonderful waitress, who made us feel like we were at home, the only person in the place that night that was hospitable. Flash forward to today.  I convinced my girlfriend that we should give it a second chance, and told her that at least the food was great that first time. Embarrassingly enough for me, after I pushed the issue, I was dead wrong. It was early in the day so plenty of open tables. We sat down. And waited. And waited. And before we knew it 15 full minutes passed before we spoke to a server. With maybe another two tables in view, it was surprising but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. We ordered, and when we received the food I knew we had made a mistake instantly. My food was as cold as if they had delivered it from another restaurant, and my girlfriends filet Mignon was not only the fattiest piece of that particular cut I had seen, but it was over cooked and mediocre. With this many good places in the area there is no room for mediocrity. Don\u2019t take my word for it. I always think people should try for themselves. But the prices don\u2019t reflect the lackluster food and service and I honestly just to want warn anyone with reservations about dining here.",

We don't have kid drinks nor kids menu.\"  Really so families do not come to eat here and you dont have juices, soda or milk?  I was in the Bar room waiting for the bathrooms (3 single stalls for the entire restaurant!!) and I noticed at least 3 other tables with 5 total kids just by glancing.  We were a big group of friends here for a birthday celebration.  When we all were seated, we asked the waiter what's his recommendation.  His wise guy answer, \"we have a small menu, everything is good!\"  OH MY GOSH!  There's at least 33 entrees on their Menu.. thats what Small means?  He did not even give us the daily specials but we overheard him tell the table of 6 Italians the specials they had or at least describe dishes to them.  When I requested my kids drinks be without ICE, our waiter gave us a drink with ice and my son was under the weather so I told him that my son doesnt want to drink it with the ice.  He says, \"You only asked for no ice for the one juice not the other one.\"  I had to explain to him I told him when I ordered I didnt want any ice in the juices. Come on, I have to explain myself again!  Asked to speak to the manager about his attitude and we get our own waiter back to apologize.  What's the point of arguing with our server; a manager should be made aware of his service unless he is THE manager?!?!  Of course the gratuity is already included on a big group as expected, so he did not have to work on the TIP, but that is no way to discriminate your costumers.  The Food (Fried calamari, pear salad, lamb chops, lobster ravioli).. edible and nothing special.  Coming back.. NEVER!",

        "caption": "We were 2 couples, who had 8pm dinner reservations last night.  Saturday March 22nd. Upon arrival, we valet our car and went inside. We were greeted by a really friendly host and were seated immediately. Our waitress was Denise. She was absolutely amazing. Funny, friendly and very tentative. As soon as we sat down, they poured water in our glasses, served us nice warm focaccia with homemade caponata. Denise immediately took our drink orders and we got our drinks within 10 minutes. We then ordered fried calamari and their special ricotta stuffed zucchini flowers. Let me tell you, the appetizers were absolutely delicious. The calamari were probably one of the best we ever had. The stuffed Zucchini flowers were just as good. BTW, my mojito was also very good. For Dinner, we ordered 1) The special : Potato gnocchi with sausage and shitake mushrooms in a reduced wine sauce over arugula. This literally melted in my mouth. Generous portion and was delicious. 2) My wife ordered G.F ( yes they have G.F pasta and you can choose any of their sauces. ) She had G.F spaghetti alla Positano. She said it was excellent. As a matter of fact, she ate the whole thing, which she rarely does. 3) My friend ordered the risotto alla pescatore. Almost like a seafood paella. He loves this dish and rarely enjoys it, because most places don't get it right. As soon as he started eating, he didn't stop ,not even to catch his breath  lol.  Seriously, he said that this was the best he has ever had. Finally, his wife ordered the Lobster ravioli. Once again, another delicious dish that was cooked to perfection. While ordering our dinner, the manager Pasquale, came over to our table and started talking to us. This guy was amazing. Professional, friendly and overall a great guy. Being that we speak Italian, we started to engage in conversations with him that were hysterical. He speaks English well, but since he knew that we spoke Italian, we had some really funny conversations. I can't speak highly enough of Pasquale and Denise. As a matter of fact, the entire staff there seemed amazing. The guy who makes the espresso and cappuccino, actually brought the coffees out to us himself and jokingly said \" Now this is authentic espresso \" He was right. Most restaurants don't know how to make the perfect espresso. He did\" For dessert, we shared what I call the absolute best chocolate lava cake I ever had. This one had melted Nutella inside. Yes freakin melted Nutella. Served with whip cream and a scoop of vanilla gelato. My friend and his wife had Tiramisu and a pistachio gelato. I tasted both, and as expected, they both tasted amazing. I have to say, I've been to plenty of Italian restaurants, which are really good. What stands out with this restaurant, is that everything from start to finish, whether it was the food or service, was absolutely the best we have experienced. Thanks again to the manager Pasquale , the amazing waitress Denise and everyone else who made this a fun and satisfying evening. We will definitely be back over and over again. You won't be disappointed.",

We shared with wife a few dishes, and our bill was for more that $150 (for two! with only one glass of wine per person). After leaving that place, we (both) developed severe intestinal cramps, and instead going to movies afterwards, we ended up in our home: my wife in upper bathroom, and I in basement one - at the same time. As we later review the menu of our meal, suspicious become Maine lobster raviolis with a \u201creduction\u201d sauce. Only 5 of ravioli with sauce which costs 25 dollar. 5 dollar a piece! We would end up better to have Pastosa stuff with our home made sauce. It would be muuuuch cheaper & without cramps! Period. Besides that, everything there is (at least) slightly overpriced. In terms of service: for their regular water, which comes in nicely iced bottles, we had to ask and wait\u2026",

Specials are always good. Service is great.  I just wish they had less of them. Sometimes we\u2019ve heard 5-6 different specials and can\u2019t remember the first one! Maybe have a small printed card with the specials? But otherwise seriously top notch.

We were greeted very warmly by very one. Our waiter was very attentive and caring, letting us know all the specials of the day. When the dishes came, it was a feast for the eyes. It was three of us, so we could not help but taste a little of each other's plates. Each sampling was an explosion of flavors that left us with the desire to try more dishes. Which we will do, the next time.  I thank the whole staff for making my daughter's day so special. Thank you so much!!!

The grilled lamb chops with spinach and saffron risotto were cooked perfectly and very tasty. BF had the Bucatini pasta meal. I didn't like it at ALL, sauce is too sweet for my liking. But he seemed okay with it. With so many other options on the menu and the AMAZING staff, we'll DEFINITELY be back. And be sure to have the French Napoleon for dessert! It's sharable but it's SO GOOD you may not want too.... I didn't care for the tiramisu. Not ENOUGH cream - cake to cream ratio is off. Enjoy!",
