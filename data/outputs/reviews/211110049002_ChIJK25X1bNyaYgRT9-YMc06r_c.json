Everyone accepts coupons low end resturants, high end restaurants, hotels, uber, dollar stores, amazon, pretty much everyone in 2019. I'm very displeased it's not like Thornton won't get the money back the makers of these products reimburse you for it. Coupons are a real form of money in these millennial times but y'all keep sleeping on them. Just keep selling gas and overpricing your spoiled merchandise your worser than every corner store at that.

He had an attitude with her as well as with me when I asked about the issue. Totally inappropriate manager, named Marcus, who looked to young anyway. He showed he did not care about his job, the customer (me) or his employees. 2.Both of the bathrooms were closed the entire time in the store, no one was cleaning them. There were a couple of employees that looked as though they were \"available\" to do so as well as the manager. No one was attempting it, was told they were unsure how long it would be.  Several customers complained & were irritated about the facilities being closed/commented on no one cleaning them. We were told to go to McDonald's on 2nd & Broadway to use their restrooms. Seems like that would take business away from Thornton's selling food items. 3. Brittany, the cashier was great. Her attitude was positive, uplifting and she was doing everything possible to keep customers from being irate. Bre'Nay, the other cashier...I saw her go outside, it was extremely cold, to pump gas for an elderly lady. She told the woman that she did not need to stand out in that cold, she would help her. Between those 2 young ladies, THEY are the reason that store was running smooth that night in the midst of chaos. I commend the service of these 2 ladies. KUDOS TO BRITTANY AND BRE'NAY for their dedication and hard work! They should be recognized in a position that does not get it like they should at times! I feel as though that manage will not do so! The GM should know about Marcus and his attitude. Someone who does not enjoy working with the public should not be doing so. If he was having a bad night....that IS NOT OUR FAULT, THE CUSTOMERS! Something must be done about him.",
