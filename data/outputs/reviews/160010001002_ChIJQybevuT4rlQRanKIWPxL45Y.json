The woman was allowing me to order and then a guy shouted from the kitchen very rudly \"are you with postmates, uber eats etc waiving his hands.\" I was shocked and responded politey postmates. He then said we don't do that not an apology or anything. It was not a prepaid order so was confused and said Oh I just order and pay and he proceeded to say NO and tell me he sent letters and requested it to be canceled but was making me feel like it was my fault and I was only there to do my job.

Line out the door, so I grabbed a menu to look over while waiting in line. Waitress snatched it out of my hands while I\u2019m looking at it and explains how they\u2019ve had people steal their menus before. Wow!! Must be some pretty special paper it\u2019s on. The whole time we were there, we felt out of place, like we were in some exclusive, overly pretentious pizza club that we weren\u2019t a part of. The waitress talked down to us several times and the a few of the other older clientele were looking over all snooty because my kids were talking at a normal level, but they\u2019re 3 and 4, so they have high voices. A lady looked over at my 4 year old daughter and \u201cshooshed\u201d her at one point, she knew the staff by name, so I assume she was a regular. My 13 year old sister-in-law was almost in tears by the end because she felt so self conscious about the uppity customers looking at us as if we were lower class the whole time. The waitress made a comment about \u201cmaybe dressing up next time\u201d For Pizza??? We adults were wearing BSU apparel after a game on a Saturday, the kids were in long sleeves and jeans. Who knew??  By the way, the pizza was pretty good, but expensive and small. We spent over $100 feeding 2 adults, 2 children and a teenager.",

They have two vegan options, which weren't listed as such, but good to know if you have dietary restrictions as I do. The staff were super friendly, Tony was flipping pizzas and helping to accommodate my needs! I have never experienced an owner cooking the food, definitely shows how passionate he is for his business!  I had the number 1, marinara I believe, added extra sauce, olives, sauteed mushrooms, and fresh arugula. They set down parmesan, crushed peppers, balsamic, and olive oil. Definitely recommend adding the balsamic and olive oil to your pizza! I have never had that offered at another pizzeria, a total game charger! Their balsamic is amazing, tastes like Italian balsamic, which if you've been there you know what I mean!:) It's a small little shop, plays opera music, highly highly recommend!  Thank you Tony!:)",

Makes sense, too, because Tony's family runs a generations-old pizzeria in Naples. Tony's pizza really actually gives me The Feels. The crust the crust THE CRUST -- crunchy and light...that RIGHT crust. Not like the heavy slab crust you find so many places that think they're making pizza but then put a bunch of rando stuff on it. Eat a margherita pizza at Tony's -- sauce, mozzarella, light basil -- and you'll see THAT is pizza and doesn't need to be camouflaged under cutesy combinations. That said, the sausage and spinach (#7 I believe?) and the thinly sliced pork, goat cheese, arugula (#17?) -- those will bring a tear to your eye. I am not exaggerating. Talk to Tony for two minutes and you'll understand why -- he is doing this with LOVE, passion, major skills and talent, wonderful ingredients, perfect pizza oven. This isn't about any cheffy ego that leaves you feeling empty. You can just taste the difference. This is true real amazing pizza. Big soul.",

He saw me parking in the loading zone in front of his established business and came out and gave me a hard time about trying to get my job done and threatened to have me ticketed for no reason.  The time he wasted on me could have been better spent with one of his customers questioning thier experience, considering the loading zone in front of his pizzeria is open to all delivery vehicles at any time of the day for any given amount of time,  no limits. I will never eat here after the experience with the owner, but I will continue to use the loading zone for its intended purpose, even if it does obstruct the view of his business. And I will never go into Tony's and interfere with him trying to run his kitchen either.",
