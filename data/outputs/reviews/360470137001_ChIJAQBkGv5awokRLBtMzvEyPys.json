Forgot I was in the city for a while. Started out with personalized wine recommendations based on our preferences for something fruity, less dry. We received a prosecco *off menu* (yes!!!) Don't remember the name but it was perfect. The caccio pepe was great, but was pleasantly surprised by the pasta with creamy pesto and shrimp. Service was so great and inviting all throughout. We really appreciate the experience. Will be back again.",

The boar ragu with pasta had such a heavy cheese taste it wasn't enjoyable. Overall I wouldn't recommend coming here.

The artisinal meat \ud83e\udd69 & cheese \ud83e\uddc0 appetizer selection was very tasty. The Jam\u00f3n Iberico was superb! Their wine knowledge and pairing was also good.  UPDATE:  They've established their footing since their opening. The backyard is a good spot to eat as well. It's so nice to ute and well decorated. Their brunch is SO GOOD. Carbonara noodles have good texture and excellent flavor. You MUST try the thick French Toast that tastes as if it had been soaking in some excellent flavor leaving it so moist. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.",

It was quite busy but service was very attentive: I recommend to let them suggest you the wine based on your order, they definitely know best, our wine was just perfect with our seafood and vegetable pastas. Definitely going back to taste some more! A must for those looking for an authentic Italian experience with super interesting natural wines.",

You name it: Le Mistral, Stone Park, Palo Santo, etc. Never ate at Terre and can't explain why but something told me I'd be disappointed - and I was. The food is good. Just good. Not amazing. The service is attentive. The atmosphere is tight and crowded. I hope there is never a fire in there. The prices are way too high for the area. What killed me was when I asked for some bread as we had none at our table - you know, as they do in Italian restaurants with olive oil and such? - We were told there was a $2 charge for this. What? On a $250 bill for two in Brooklyn!!? The millennial manager came over and said he'd take it off of our bill. How kind of him.

The food was OK, we didn't love the apps much  and felt the quality of the meats weren't good. Everything had bread which was overwhelming. Felt like I ate more bread than anything. The Octopus was overcooked and hard to chew with little to no flavor. The Asparagus was overcooked in 1 pasta dish and was very soggy. We did enjoy some other pasta dishes though. The wine was pretty good too. Unexpectedly though, our bills was $400 for 3 people. We had no idea that was coming-which was disappointing because we felt we were taken advantage of. When the manager or owner willingly shows up to your table saying he is opening a bottle for tonight that we should try we just felt that... we should try it. We had no idea it was an outrageously expensive bottle that would bring our bill that high. The meal was certainly not worth $400 and we wish we weren't tricked into drinking wine we didn't ask for. We were just trying to catch a quick bite and have a glass of wine. So, if you do head here, make sure you know what you're drinking.",

Didn't get our wine till way after we were done with first course. Ordered the eggplant appetizer, which was barely cooked, hard, and inedible. Shisito pepper app was an interesting idea, but hard to eat and not very flavorful. Pasta took about another 45 to arrive, and honestly just tasted like a very very expensive mac & cheese. Had to go to another restaurant after to redeem the night.",

Wonderful wine selection- ever had orange wine?- and very friendly and helpful wait staff. The cheese (truffle) and prosciutto appetizer was delicious. The eggplant lasagna was more like eggplant with a tomato sauce. I think the pasta dishes are meant to be paired with a second meat, by themselves they feel lacking. We had the special (porcini mushrooms and truffle) and the first listed pasta (with pork jowl), the sauces and flavor was a bit too gentle and muted.. The strip steak was a nice serving and medium rare in the center, but medium throughout the rest. Overall: Good for drinks and appetizers in a nice garden",

The food itself was really good, and seemed to be very authentic. The wine list is also very interesting and the wine we chose, by the glass was also good. Two things that made the evening memorable for all the wrong reasons, the waitress was trying to upsell on the wine, but just constantly tried to get us to have the expensive Barolo. I understand an upsell, but this was not the way to do it. What really upset us both was the Chef, who very enthusiastically congratulated us on our wine choice promised to give us a taste of another wine from his region. He filled our glasses, and made it seem like he was treating us, but at the end of the evening those two glasses of wine were on the check and were $21 each.  We were not asked if we wanted to buy this glass, or told the price in advance, and to have an extra $42 to pay on the bill felt dishonest. Of course they may have made an extra few bucks from us that night, but have now lost 4 customers, (we will not come back with our wives). Go for the food, but be really careful when they start to offer you extra wine.",
