The mac & cheese was probably the worst thing we\u2019ve ordered from any of the vendors at Armature Works. Even our younger daughter, who would eat mac & cheese three times a day, didn\u2019t want it. We had much better luck with the last two items. The brisket was served with three very thick slices (see picture below), bread and coleslaw \u2013 it had a good taste, but was a little dry. Our favorite item from BnB was their ribs \u2013 they were meaty and flavorful, and something we would definitely order again!",

The two employees were busy both stocking cans of sprite into their front cooler (while the kitchen put my food near them under a heat lamp for 5 mins). I made the mistake of adding a tip at the beginning\u2014 I realize it\u2019s optional but thought food workers need help especially now with income. Had I known the food would have been this bland and poor service I would have not tipped them. The pork sandwich was just ok \u2014 the Mac n cheese was weird texture to me with huge noodles caked together. Do yourself a favor and pick out a better establishment such as Empamama\u2019s which have amazing cheeseburger empanadas there.",

It was chips, 90lbs of this cheese stuff, some corn niblets and perhaps an 1/8th cup of cold pork. It was weird. We just dig around for dry chips. The philly \u2014 idk maybe had chicken in it? We couldn\u2019t taste it. The bread was soggy, it was dripping that onion-y grease and the wet cheese stuff. It\u2019s a tie for which one of us had the most disappointing food. The paper straws didn\u2019t offset the plastic cutlery or plastic cups or plastic wrappers on the cutlery but it did make it impossible to drink our tea which was like tea in that it was brown. They were out of a lot of things by 1230. It was the shortest line out of anywhere in the place so we gave it a whirl. Maybe it was an off day, we just didn\u2019t enjoy our experience.",

My daughter ordered a pound to split and the whole thing was fat and oily.  I know. I know Brisket has fat.  Why yes it does and it helps add flavor, but not when the whole thing is fat when maybe a couple slivers of meat.  The chicken was dry.  The collards were soaked in something weird and the mac n cheese while looking divine was rather bland.  I wish 4 Rivers or Mission BBQ had a spot at Armature.  This was the one time in 4 months that we got to go out as a family because of my daughters heart surgery and I feel we should have picked something else.",

We ordered two lunch specials which is $10 and it comes with a drink and side of fries. Special for that was \"quesadilla burgers\" which was just hard taco shells with ground beef. They only had one cook preparing all the orders so that explains the line. Also got the 1/2 pound of brisket for $11 and to be honest, I wasn't all too impressed with the food. The lemonade tasted like a kitchen cleaner and the quesadillas were dry. The fries were delicious though so that deserves one star. The friendly cashier was nice so that's anther star but that's all they're getting from me. Brisket was dry and BBQ sauce tasted like too much alcohol. I think every place in Armature Works is overpriced but it's expected so I can't say much but I can say that I at least tried this place.",

It came on an undersized overstuffed hamburger bun. The result was very messy though both the bun and the BBQ were good. and there was no L or T. Just meat.  maybe I heard the name wrong?  Anyway this is one of the better stalls at armature works.",

Some of the chips were stale, they cover them with cheese sauce so your hopefull to find some meat, no luck after the search was completed. Corn fritters it's just a ball of batter fried no corn in sight. Go elsewhere for what you pay. The empanadas spot at the other end will not disappoint with Cuban empanada.",
