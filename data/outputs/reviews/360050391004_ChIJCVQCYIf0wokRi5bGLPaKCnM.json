While im pouring the sauce, I asked again and he said no it's the hot sauce so then I told him just give me a minute and I'll clean it off. He didn't listen and put barbecue sauce on top of the hot sauce. Then I got mad and told her to please give my money back because he's not listening at all.

My weakness is boneless spare ribs, and you can actually tell alot about a Chinese takeout restaurant by how they serve their ribs.  The very first bite of their boneless spare ribs seemed off. So I kept chewing, and trying to discern what it was that I wasn't liking. Slowly, it became clear, the meat had turned.  I won't go here again. If they don't taste their own food, or knowingly use expired product (which I sincrely hope isn't the case) then I can't pay them to cook for me and mine. Sadly, this area needs better Chinese takeout options.  For now, I'm stuck travelling 30 minutes east to pelham area for better options.",
