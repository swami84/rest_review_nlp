The Caesar salad was large and delicious. The wings were fabulous. The fries were good. Now, let's talk about these wings. They only have five flavors. That's a disappointment. I love lemon pepper. That option doesn't exist. However, the hot wings are hot. The spicy garlic wings are hot. The sweet chili wings are unbelievably good and the BBQ wings are good. They have a teryaki flavor as well which we didn't try. However, these wings are HUGE. When I say huge, I mean, they are size of your palm. They are massive. These are wings on steroids. I've never seen wings this large - EVER. Now that is a great thing if you know it in advance. The pictures don't do it justice for what I saw. I wish the server would have said, these wings are huge. For two people, 25 wings is just way too much. We could have done 10 wings and been full since that's basically what we ate. Getting water was a bit of a pain. Very slow. The bartender was handling our table as well which made her response time very slow. Took a while to get our salad. But the presentation of the wings was excellent. Goes a long way. When I go back to Chicago, I will definitely go there again, but only get the 10 piece wing for two people. Again, excellent wings. Lots of TVs. I look forward to when they can open again fully cause that place must be popping when it's in full effect.",

With that being said I've never had a problem with food here... Friendly staff.. Politeness.. Maybe it's lack of staffing... But I get better service from the support (barback /busser ) than the actual server/bartender..  They're making drinks, filling things up, cleaning,running around etc etc.. Don't get me wrong bartenders/servers have to talk to 900 people, ring things and deal with our complaints, follow all these new rules...etc etc all while still smiling so like I said mb its lack of staffing..  So I hope they're taking care of their support! I'll definitely keep coming back and supporting the neighborhood and yes I tipped appropriately!  Also the hostess was very friendly!!!",

        "caption": "I came here to watch some college football, eat some good food and that is exactly what I got. Sometime ago I noted The Fifty/50 as being a college football supporting sports bar which led me to bookmarking it, but really didn't expect on visiting it this evening after contemplating another visit to 'Mac's Wood Grilled'. I stepped in hesitant, but got comfortable once I sat at the bar to get a feel. You can also give the assist to the server Dan, and a couple of drunk middle-aged men who entertained me as I got a feel of the bar while looking around.  The Fifty/50 is a fancy looking sports bar with sort of a club feel. It has that open window style and patio seating with a television actually pointing outside the bar towards the patio as well as many other televisions inside for your enjoyment.  Even though the Illinois Fighting Illini vs Nebraska Cornhuskers game was not the primary game being showcased I was happy they atleast had it on one of the televisions. It kept me excited as I watched the Notre Dame Fighting Irish vs Georgia Bulldogs game which was the primary game being showcased on majority of the televisions. Both were actually games I preferred to see.  As for the menu, it actually took me a while to get a feel of it because I wanted a reason to return for something other than what I would choose, plus I didn't want to leave and go elsewhere. I bounced between looking at several options noted in the prime burgers, sandwiches and wraps, and soups + salads sections with my eye on the fried chicken sandwich which was listed in the sandwiches and wraps section. Outside of the fried chicken sandwich, the mother earth (vegan), sliders, and the turkey burger caught my eye on their menu. All three definitely sounded tasty!  As for the fried chicken sandwich, it was huge and delicious! I literally had to open my mouth wide during every bite. I ended up finishing it unexpectedly, but prior to receiving it from the server Dan, I gave him that look as though I would be needing a to-go container. After eating I ended up ordering a 'Root's' root beer which was recommended by Dan, as well as 'Roots Handmade Pizza'. Roots Handmade Pizza is owned by Greg Mohr and Scott Weiner, who are actually the owners of The Fifty/50. Of course me being a pizza lover I instantly bookmarked Roots Handmade Pizza for a future visit.  My cell phone signal was terrible inside of this bar; most of the time I had one-to-two bars which quickly drained my battery as I used it mostly to Yelp. Some advice! If you are an avid Yelper like myself I recommend using their wifi access which all you would need is their guest access code.  Like many of the other bars along this strip your only option for parking is neighborhood parking which can seem like a witch hunt, depending on what time of the day it is. Where you park at may set you a few blocks from the bar, but nothing too excruciating. And be sure to note any signs in the neighborhood because certain spots require you to have a certain residential parking permit to park between displayed hours. I say that because I recieved a ticket for $75.00, but you know what? Atleast it was that instead of my vehicle being towed.  And lastly, other than the Fighting Illini losing to the Cornhuskers I enjoyed my visit overall (vibes, interaction with staff, and food ordered). Do I recommend The Fifty/50? Yes indeed I do! And on another note I am not a drinker, but I did note on the menu that drinks are cheaper during happy hour. Enjoy!  Thomas G",

This time it was a Sunday late afternoon and it was busy. So the  street level was packed and the hostess sat us up stairs which was fine other than a big fan blowin on us on a cold day.  We waited...and we waited...and we waited...and we even waited some more and no one waited on us. Not even a glass of water. There were other people up there eating and we saw a girl on the other side of the room come and grab some plates but  we were invisible. I finally went downstairs and spoke to a bartender who assured me he'd have someone come up and take care of us. So we waited and waited....well you get it. finally I said screw it lets go somewhere else. I mentioned to the blonde hostess what happened and it was  like a  \"oh well\" response. We went a few doors down to The Big Pour where the food and drinks were great and the service was top notch. Totally disappointed in this place. I tweeted them before doing a public review but no response.",

My brother and I went to go sit at a table and was asked to move cause the table was reserved. Okay no problem, so they found us a table in a little corner stuck between two big groups that were there. Manger said the hostess will take care of us shortly, 15 minutes later we are just watching the hostess just continue to talk to the bouncer, and ignore us while we watch the same manger and other waitresses continue to just pass us up. So after a while I continued to try to get the mangers attention, I literally had to get off my seat and chase him across the bar. I finally caught his attention and told him we have been there for over 15minutes after moving us and not one person had attended to us or at least gave us a glass of water. The manger responded by saying \"well that's fair I'll try to take care of that\". In what world is that \"fair\" ? We like the food and drinks but the service from some of the staff was horrible. I personally work at a restaurant myself and there was definitely a better way to take care of that situation. Really makes me reconsider going there ever again.",

The first wing I went to eat was hard as a rock. They forgot our sauce for the wings as well and there was only one waitress serving food so it wasn't easy to get her attention.

        "caption": "Yesterday I had visited Fifty/50. Overall I thought the place was great. We had a great time until it was time for our checks to be given back after we paid. At the end of dinner we decided that we were ready for our checks our server gave them to us, we paid and he took them to charge everyone. I was expecting our original waiter to come and hand checks back I guess he was busy or something because he sent a woman named Jessica who we hadn't met She called everyone except me by first names and gave everyone except me their checks back. I was the only person to payed in cash and I was expecting some change back. After I didn't receive my change back I went downstairs and found my waiter and asked him what happened to my check/ change he told me that he didn't know what happened to my check and also told me that he didn't have change he attempted to hand me a $1 and I told him that that wasnt enough that he owed me more he said again that he didn't have change. I didn't noticed that the woman Jessica who bought the checks to us after they were paid was sitting right there she told me that she gave my check to one of my co-workers she claimed that she asked everyone if they paid with cash and he told her yes and so she handed him my check. That was untrue because she called Everyone by their first name except me. I never heard my name called that's how I was able to recognize that she didn't have my change so she told a bold-faced lie. As we walked back downstairs she told me that she gave it to one of my co-workers. The co-worker who she claimed she gave the check to was gone. She was so nonchalant about the whole deal. I told Jessica that I was still need my change back because it's not my fault that she could not locate my check or change. Me and her walked back to the bar where she was sitting and my waiter was working she reached in her purse grabbed $3 threw it at me and said it's only $3. So now I realize that she took my change and pocketed it. Why else would she give me $3 out of her purse?Why would she conveniently have $3 and that's the exact change that I was missing? Why would she give me $3 when she wasn't our waitress?Why would she give me $3 of her own money? Brought me to the realization that this lady pocketed my money and was upset because I asked for my change. It wasn't her place to take my money she thought I wasn't going to ask for it because to her it was only $3. I had already tipped the waiter because their gratuity was tacked on to the bill. She took it upon herself to keep my money and thought that I wasn't supposed to ask for it back how insane is that?I noticed that this restaurant has a lot of great reviews and they're supposed to have the best chicken in Chicago how can a place with such great reviews have such poor staff?I felt very disrespected that she reached in her purse threw my money which she stole from me in my face as if I was wrong for asking for it back. I was very hurt and offended by her actions. She never apologized and she was very nasty and rude. I've never seen anything like this in my life. I visit Division Street all the time and I've never been treated like this before at a bar. I did speak to one of the managers and he was nice he explained that if I were to come back he would take care of me. After I left I felt even worse I felt like she got away with stealing and disrespecting me I feel absolutely terrible about the whole ordeal. Something needs to be done about this young woman she should lose her job. I should have got my money back for the meal. I was so frustrated I didn't think of this at the time. How would they feel if I would have just pulled a dine and dash? Well the waitress basically did that to me she took my money put it in her purse. How many other people has she done this to? This is totally unethical and unacceptable. Make sure you get your change back after dining at this place because apparently they will pocket your change. Is not about the money it's about the principal.",

If you claim to have award winning wings then every batch you sell should taste as good as they were when you presented them to the judges. The waitress was nice.  She even tried to replace my over-smoked wings but the cook sent the same thing out. For 30 bucks = YUCK!!",

The cheddar & bacon waffle fries are ridiculously tasty as well. Lots of great food options - salads, sandwiches, wings, burgers, and more. Definitely come to catch your favorite sports, a cold one, and some great pub grub.",
