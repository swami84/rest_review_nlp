Definitely recommended.  I have reason to believe that the hotter wings were spawned from Satan himself. The spicy gap between the two choices was vast. Hot is officially for little baby boys. Hotter is for true barbarians. I was able to complete them OBVIOUSLY, and they tasted fabulous, but I was shocked after the first bite. Maybe try this sauce on the side if you're feeling... Saucy.  Service wasn't super attentive and there was no AC, but whatever. I liked this place a lot.",

I sat right in front of the deep fryers and the grill so I saw all the frying goodness in action. You know it's super fresh food when you can see everything the chef is doing. Major kudos to the chef - he was making a million things at once (I'm sure this is normal but how often are you arms-length away from the chef to witness all of it).  Now. The WINGS. Very good, sauce was great. I would have preferred a tad more sauce and wings could have been a bit juicer. I'm sure if the chef wasn't swamped and manning three different stations, the wings would have been pretty close to perfect.  Note: if you're a football fan, this place might not be the best place to watch a game since they only have two small tvs that are at opposite ends of the bar/restaurant. But.. if you're a Bills fan, definitely check it out & eat some wings.",
