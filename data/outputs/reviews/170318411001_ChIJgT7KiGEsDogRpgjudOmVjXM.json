First of all, the attitude of the people managing and serving in Hing Kee is awful. They put up a \u2018Don\u2019t care attitude for customers\u2019. They served us with utter apathy which highlighted their extreme lack of hospitality. Second, the food was served in paper plates, plastic spoons and forks and plastic water cups. I have been to several restaurants in Chicago and none did actually serve in paper plates. For a second we thought as if we are buying food from a food truck ! I mean come on guys we pay for you to serve us on paper plates and plastic spoons.Third and maybe the most important, the FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. We ordered Schezwan chicken and all we found was 3 tiny pieces of chicken and lots and lots of onions. It was basically Schezwan onions ! The dumplings were HORRIBLE too ! They had a thick shell and tiny portions of cabbage and chicken( though I doubt there was any chicken). There are several good restaurants in Chinatown which serve not only good food but also also serve in a good presentable manner with the required hospitality ! For Hing Kee management : Guys if you don\u2019t want to serve, then don\u2019t open the dine-in option, just have delivery. You guys are setting a bad example for Chinatown restaurants.",

We ordered the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and Mapo tofu. The soup dumplings were by far the best part of the meal and made the trip worth it. The scallion pancakes were just alright and the Mapo tofu left something to be desired. It was pretty bland compared to other Mapo tofu dishes I've head.  Definitely try the soup dumplings! Also, everything is very reasonably priced. My total was approximately $36.",

For the main course chicken was okayish so was the stir fry, i have had a lot better.  But sure for dumplings hing kee is a must visit.

My favorite of this restaurant is their salt and pepper spicy chicken wings. The best chicken wings ever!! I\u2019m not a huge fan of chicken wings drowning in bbq sauce, and theirs is amazing. Spicy, a bit hot, not over cooked, crispy skin, tender meat, and delicious. And NO bbq sauce. And yet super flavorful. My kids are old enough to drive to Chinatown on their own, (we live in the far north suburbs of Chicago, and it\u2019s an hour drive to get to this restaurant, but it is worth it. ). They don\u2019t want mom to come along - they want to spread their wings and this Chinatown area is safe so I\u2019m ok with it - but I always insist that they bring back the chicken wings to me. They went yesterday and I ate some last night. Didn\u2019t disappoint, again for the Nth time. Truly they are delicious.",

Originally in winter, the seats were expanded to the outside of the store This crowded shop is also sparsely populated in mid-September. In such a hot weather, hot kamameshi. .. .. .. It's the best. Yeah. Order beer as soon as you arrive A well-chilled large bottle is coming.  While drinking it, sweating and waiting for it to finish cooking.  The first cup was Mach, While licking with the body of checking the seasoning on the table At the time when I said whether to beat the calm second cup An aunt who is a work gloves brings a clay pot of Achiachi.  Remove the lid and slowly sprinkle with soy sauce on the table. Mix the whole with a ranger. And the lid. The smell of fluffy soy sauce drifts, and appetite becomes a critical point.  Still pretending to be calm The beer is in the middle of the third cup with the rice grains attached to the astragalus when mixed.  When the lid is finally removed, the mellow soy sauce scent explodes. It's frustrating to hold down the handle and move it to the plate while saying Achiachi. While biting the pork spine, the saltiness of the salt fish again Add a slight nuance of fish stock. It's my best choice. This is the one that is too burnt.

If you order the regular XLB you'll end up with a wonton wrapper soup dumpling. While it is still delicious, it wasn't what were were looking for. The Shanghai style XLB is delicious but it could honestly use a little more soup on the inside. Regardless, I'll take it! The dan dan noodles were bursting with flavor and maybe even somewhat spicy. Yum. I cannot wait to come back here and try more things on the menu!",

The soup flavor and the dumplings themselves were yummy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The side (ginger soy) sauce was also unique and good with the dumplings, but I preferred no sauce. Staff makes them fresh and right in front, so you can see them create these pillows of goodness. Service was a bit slow, but they were very busy. However, staff was friendly and the restaurant seemed family ran. We didn't try anything else, but the dumplings, but the menu looked good! There's no WiFi here, there's a bathroom towards the back, and there's limited seating. When we left, there was a line out the door. I recommend their Xiao Long Bao, but everything else looked good, coming to other people's tables.",

But even after I left with my service animal, they denied service to my wife and family.  I have been here a handful of times and their service is always below par.  Half the workers do not understand english so they are constantly messing up our orders, especially the ones I call in for pick up.  I never complain or write reviews but this situation made me very upset, both when i had my service animal in the restaurant with me and once i left with my service animal to wait outside.",

First experience - we randomly chose to go here in the afternoon because it seemed busy and the lady making fresh dumplings you could see from the window seemed like a sure enough sign to go in and enjoy the food. We were asked to sit in their upstairs part of the restaurant so we did. There were about 5 tables upstairs and were in the process of settling in and ordering. Well, we waited to order with no acknowledgement. We made phone calls, replied to emails and chatted amongst each other. In the meantime, another tourist family came in and requested for a table of 4 and the staff blatantly refused service even though there were 6 empty tables. The family were visibly embarrassed and left saying that we should just go elsewhere. That was a sign for us that the service was not at all hospitable. After waiting for close to 20 minutes after being told that they will be coming to take our order, we left. No one cared. And we enjoyed a nice meal across the street.  Second experience - we got food delivered from this place just to give a second chance and try their food. Big big mistake. The food was undercooked, not tasty at all, reeked of fish-oyster sauce and smell. Nothing was labeled so we didn't know what dumpling was what. It literally felt like a bland, not appetizing blind testing. Probably only have 4 dumplings and egg drop soup from our entire order and everything was wasted, unfortunately. But those dumplings and soup were enough to give us a stomach ache and so much gas all night long. It was a horrible experience.  I didn't take any pictures of this place or the food because it was definitely not worth it.  This restaurant lacks in all aspects of a good dining experience. They need to update their cooking skills and service. Would not recommend this restaurant.",

We had Vietnamese Pho noodles, Thai Tom Yum, and Japanese Udon along with some perfectly cooked, delicious Chinese dumplings. It was cool to be in China town and get such a nice variety of Asian food. Service was friendly, fast and great. Their noodle/soup dishes were approximately $10 each and their dumplings were about $8 for sixteen dumplings. In a part of town with so many choices to choose from, I feel we had the opportunity to eat at one of the best.",

Their noodles carry tastes unique to China that is unlike the Malaysian, Taiwanese or Hong Kong cuisine.  Their noodles are hand made and have a Q factor that is firm and springy, really terrific and addictive noodles!  Today we tried the dan dan mian and spicy chicken noodles. Both Sichuan specialties with tons of aromatic spices.  Dan dan mian is fried minced pork with a healthy dose of sesame paste, Sichuan pepper and chili oil, making the broth rich and complex, and is bowl exploding with aromatic layers and flavors.  Laziji noodles is basically spicy chicken noodles. The broth is a clear chicken soup that is clean and sweet, and topped with marinated chicken infused with  Sichuan chilli peppers, spicy\u00a0bean paste,\u00a0and Sichuan peppers. This gives the basic broth a extra layer of flavor profile. However it's not as spicy as laziji normally is.",

I first heard about Hing Kee from friends who mentioned their soup dumplings are some of Chicago's best. These hand-made xiaolongbao's did not disappoint. They are extremely soupy and the skins are just thin enough to hold the hefty amount of filing and soup. I would say I'm quite picky about the thickness of the skin and I think they definitely hit the marks here. What I like most about their xiaolongbao is actual the soup - packed with beef broth yet not too greasy. A bite of their xiaolongbao warms the soul!  However, besides the soup dumpling, I'm quite disappointed at the rest of their menu. I haven't had a solid dish to go with their amazing xiaolongbao. Their beef noodles were just average and many of the generic dish -- such as kunpao chicken -- are fairly below average for a Chinatown restaurant. I hope they can really improve their other dishes to really round out the experience.",

Servers were rude and unresponsive. Although the food was good, the portions were smaller than usual. Then the bill came. We didn\u2019t mind paying. However, the server who ignored us the entire time communicated the the remaining change was not enough for a tip. We were like what? We had no intentions of tipping. Yet we were going to let you have the change. So she went on stating that all customers have to pay $7+ tip for water and being served. I responded if that is the case a grutility should be displayed on the check and customers should be informed before dining. In short we were cornered as if we were attempting to run out without paying after we paid. To avoid further conflict we gave her an additional $3 for the mandatory tip! I was baffled \ud83d\ude2e like I recommended this place to many! I have been here on several occasions and NEVER have I felt so disrespected. By the way my ManFriend is of African descent. I believe this was a contributing factor to poor service! I\u2019ll never go there again!",

When walking in the place smells strongly of rotting fish, the waiters were talking amongst themselves until they noticed us and then we were seated. After being seated a different waiter came by and rudely told us to move because they wanted to sit other people down. We had no choice other than to share a table with other customers. Then once we placed our order the food took a crazy time to be prepared. We receive our food maybe an hour later. The food was tasteless, uncooked and looked very poorly prepared. My friend ordered a plate for about 20 dollars and could only manage to stomach 3 spoonfuls before feeling sick. After finishing we told the staff that the food was undercooked and they got mad at us. They told us we should have said something earlier and not have eaten it. Then they gave us attitude and only took one dollar off the bill. Then they had the audacity to ask for a 20% tip.",

I asked for another glass and told the waitress about it. She checked, saw it, showed it to another waitress who just laughed about it.

We even spaw women bringing out cooked rice and throwing it in the grill to warm up. There were 3 different waitresses trying to take our order, and were all confused. There is zero organization. You would think from how busy it is, every waitress had their own section to avoid the confusion and disorganization. To top off our experince we found a hair in our hong kong style bread. Im not surprised if they removed the hair and stuck it back in the oven they were pretty dry when originally you can see the freshness due to the oil on top. First amd last time here. Try \"Chi Cafe\" you wont be dissapointes there \ud83d\udc4d",

I waited and waited sitting in a full restaurant but no one came by for any service while I saw them take orders all around. Just because people come in groups does not mean a single  customer should be ignored. I walked to the billing counter and asked them how long do I have to wait for someone to take my order. She said wait and again no one showed up. They walked past me like I didn't exist. Finally I asked the billing counter if I owe them anything since no one took my order. The gentleman said $1. I paid that left. Would not recommend.",

        "caption": "I used to love coming to this restaurant but after an incident with one of the servers two days ago I will no longer go again. The service I received that day was horrible. They had gotten two of the things that I had ordered wrong and when I told my server that these were not the items I had ordered she told me I was wrong and that they absolutely were. I knew I was not wrong because I used to go there a lot and I always ordered the same things but I decided to not complain any further and to try and eat the food but I couldn't eat that soup, it was disgusting so I left most of it on the plate not even bothering to try and finish it. Also because of the service I received I decided to leave a small tip but that apparently did not sit well with the server who told who I assume to be the head server and he ran out of the restaurant yelling at us saying that we had not left enough money for the bill and humiliating us in front of other people. I told him we left an exact amount and the server had counted it also but I still walked inside to hear them out. Among insults he counted the money and realized I had left the correct amount but proceeded to say that the tip was not enough and I had to leave more. I told him I would not because of the service and he still demanded on at least twenty dollars more as tip. All i said was no and left. I advise you that if you go there be prepared for bad service and to be yelled at for leaving the incorrect tip amount in their opinion.",

It was so bad that we did not leave a tip and one of the waitresses proceeded to yell at me by telling me I had to understand that they were busy. We had to ask for things more than three times and we were given an attitude and face like we were bothering them. I order steamed noodles instead of rice and the waitress acted like I was wrong and disgusting for eating my meal with steamed noodles. Never again will I go there. We would of definitely left a tip if we didn't feel force to and they would of communicated about the wait times. I'm fair and I understand when the business is busy, but I also felt disrespected. As an educated women, No one talks to me like that.",
