The seating is very accommodating. There are also hangers available for your bag or jacket next to you, which is a nice touch.  This is my go-to place when meeting with friends and family.  Here I had the omelette on rye with black garlic (get anything with the black garlic \u2014 it\u2019s amazing). And before that we had their homemade Madeline\u2019s and toast with ricotta and honey. My favorite part was eating the fresh homemade whipped cream for the Madeline\u2019s straight from the bowl. I paired my meal with a cappuccino, which was so delicious and nice and strong!",
