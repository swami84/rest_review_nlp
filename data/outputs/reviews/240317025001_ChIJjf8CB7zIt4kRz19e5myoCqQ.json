This is place is owned by a guy who focuses on one thing and does it well rather then trying to run a science lab of experimental cuisine.  Most of the meats and charcuterie are made and aged in house, the whole fish is fantastic, the grilled artichoke hearts are a meal into themselves, and the bone marrow is a great dish to share as you slowly listen to the sweet sounds of your arteries slamming shut.  If you can find a night when the owner is cooking, the dry aged steaks are among the best I've ever had.

I was ok with that and my expectations were not a classic steakhouse. But, service was not just slow, but actually repeatedly forgetful. Drinks tasted really nice... gin and tonic and the lavender margarita. Gin came out relatively normal time, but waiter completely forgot my wine. I had to remind him about 30 minutes later. We ordered the lavender when my late wine came and this drink  came out when dinner was over half done. They did comp the drink which was nice. They were out of the porterhouse... it's Friday night and you're out of steak? Waiter didn't know until after he took our order. How is this not told to the wait staff? Had a strip and a ribeye. Steaks came out a bit cooled off, so they were sitting for a bit obviously. Taste was really nice but my strip had a lot of fat (more than it should have been). Charred veggies as the side was pretty good. We skipped dessert-- just too much 'ehhhh' feeling by that point. Maybe we should have just gone with the meat mountain from the price fixe....",

And a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli- that\u2019s green, so that makes it healthy right? And for the app get the charcuterie board. Also awesome. Normally they have a decent beer selection and great mixed drinks. Love the Moscow Mule there. Wish I could say I have tried more of the wines but honestly I haven\u2019t explored the wine list enough yet. I have always had great service at both the tables and the bar. If you are in the area and you are a carnivore you have to try the Urban Butcher.",

The mac and cheese was the hilight.  The brussel sprouts were bitter when eating the whole piece but when we cut off the stalk was much better. The aged Ribeye was ok to say the least. We had some good buttery bites from the very top and bottom cuts but the middle had a lot of hard sinewey pieces that were hard to cut even with a steak knife and it was just bland with an old flavor and not buttery at all.  We finished the meal with the donut and nutella whip which was ok.  Overall we were dissapointed since the meal was quite pricey.

This time I took my wife and some friends on a sunday evening, the place was not empty but there were plenty of free tables. Our waitress Monique was very attentive and friendly. Our food came out on time and was very good. The atmosphere was great, we all felt relaxed and comfortable sitting on the edge of the restaurant on a breezy summer day. The star of the show for me was the passion fruit creme brulee. My party really enjoyed the food and the service and they wanted to know when we would be back! try to come by when there is no rush. my only complaint would be the loud music coming from all the way across the street but we kinda blocked it after the first ten minutes. Will definitely come again!",

They forgot the brussel sprouts. The cheese plate included two small slices of five different cheeses at $5 each and two pieces of bread for a party of 4. $9 for mixed greens tossed with salt and olive oil, no acid. The seasonal salad was listed at $9 on the menu, but our server said the menu was wrong and the cost was actually $14. The ceviche was good and the other items we ordered (burger & fries, truffle Mac&cheese, smoked salmon) we're fine. Once our table was cleared we had to repeatedly ask for more silverware because the server never bothered to assess who had utensils. The server also never checked in on the food, took only the women's drink orders (ignoring the men) and never asked for a second drink order. When we asked a second time for more bread said \"I put the order in, but let me check.\" The right words, but the quote doesn't do the passive agressive behavior justice, which included the server bumping into me twice and my wife noted his arm came way to close to her breast as he reached across her. We were at Urban Butcher for 2.5 hours and the second time we requested the check our server blamed the delay on the system rather than acknowledging it. The new decor (black and red) is awful and the noise level outrageous. What should have been 2-3 hours of relaxing enjoyment and conversation was stressful and we felt imprisoned.",

Despite getting to the restaurant early (way before the dinner rush) we had to wait foreeeeever for our food.  When we finally did get our meals,  the busboys constantly hovered over us waiting to grab our plates and were not very graceful about it, sometimes dropping things. They continually interrupted our dinner conversation to swoop in and grab our plates and silverware, and it's obvious they are not well-trained or experienced on how to smoothly come in and clean up the table without being disruptive to the customer. Very annoying!  The food was delicious but way over priced for the quality we got. I feel like we could have gotten most of our food at pretty much any other ordinary restaurant....and at a fraction of the price!  And don't even get me started on how noisy this place is. definitely do now plan on bringing anyone here that you intend on having a conversation with. (Or really I would just avoid this place altogether)",

We arrived on time, gave our name, and the hostess said it would be a minute. Five minutes later, after 3 parties with reservations were seated in front of us, the hostess then informed me it would be a couple more minutes.  About 25 minutes later we were still not seated even though we had reservations with no update from the hostess.  We informed the hostess that we would be leaving.  She only said okay, and looked shocked anyone would leave as she was more concerned about her outfit and how she looked rather than informing us we would need to wait longer or apologize for the delay.

Our server was very rude and looked like he had the attention span of a ferret, to say the least.He snatched the menu when my sister in law was still looking at it, then asked her if she was still looking at it. My friend ordered ceviche, she did not like it and wanted to return it, he started trying to convinced her that it was real ceviche and that it was good when she clearly did not like the way that it was made. This is not expressing the way he was acting through out the night. He brought the check over it was six of us. I asked him if we could split it, he said \u201cyes\u201d, we needed to figure it out by looking at the receipt and breaking it down\u201d. He looked like he had an attitude when he said that. He broke the receipt down. Apparently \"it did not add up\" he chose one card and said there is a difference of $24 and said \"I will charge this card because it was going to take to long to process in a breakdown. How do you just choose witch card to charge with out permission? I said ok that's fine, because it was my card. The math we did was off by 6 dollars. No big deal. Kadeem E. Was the one of the worst servers I have encountered in my lifetime. The reason why I am very disappointed is because it was my fianc\u00e9's birthday and he had a horrible experience! I paid way to much to have an experience like that.",

Next time I go, I might take advantage of their early dinner (until 7:30) restaurant week like special. A nice little 3 course for $35 or so. So why 4/5... the last time we had a new waiter. The waiter was fantastic. He was curious, attentive and super nice to my 4 year old daughter. This is more a critique of management for not training up the staff.  During our time there, several of the staff struggled with simply questions: do you have Glenfiddich? (important note: full bar, decent mixed drinks, happy hour prices are like 40% off), do you have blue cheese dressing? (they don't, which not having blue cheese crumbles is surprising for a steak place), what's in the bacon dressing?, and how many donuts come in the serving? These are basic menu questions the staff should be able to answer. Last couple of notes: I noticed the broccolini was undercooked, nice char but raw and broccolini can be tough. My cappuccino was more of a cafe au lait. But I'll give the benefit of the doubt as we were on the early side (4 year old kid) and it was packed on a Friday night so not everything goes as expected.  In short, get a cocktail, get the charcuterie board, get the porterhouse and a dessert. For the 2 of you, you'll walk out $225 lighter but full and talking about how tender that steak was. It was so good I couldn't take the pic before I started. Like I said, Fridays and Saturdays are kickin' so you'll want a to make a reservation.",

The focus is definitely meat, with really good house cured charcuterie  - super yummy - and a great steak.  They have some good cocktails as well.  The night we went, it was very, very loud, and while the waiter was really nice, he was covering a lot of tables and service was slow.  The chairs - while cool and trendy looking - were astonishingly uncomfortable, given the length of time we sat there.  If it weren't for the chairs, I probably give the place a 4 star.  Hopefully next time!",

Namely Lavender Margaritas & a Lamb Tartare - all beckoning me inside and out of the stifling 97\u00b0 heat.  As I entered there was a group speaking with the host/mgr (proprietor?) explaining they'd eventually have 8 for dinner. As this large group was chatting with host, he stopped engaging with them because omg! A woman alone, walking with purpose (obviously to the bar) omg!!! he decided he just had to loudly and rudely greet me:  H/P-Hello! Good evening! Are you here for dinner?!Hello??!!  Me-(Smiling but not stopping because guests were standing around the entrance STILL speaking to him & why should I explain myself) so smiling and WITH eye contact responded to his question: Hello; no.  H/P-(Sort of stalking me): Are you!!!!?? Are you!!!!?? Going to the bar!!!!??  Me-Still smiling and while making eye contact nod in agreement with his inquiry an infant could correctly interpret. Nodding my head up and down in the affirmative. One of many international gestures for 'yes.'  He still looked upset. I truly do not know what his issue was except that I was not as dressed up as I normally would have been if not for the stifling 97\u00b0 heat. I was a bit sportier than usual for dining out.  Feeling guilty for wearing $100 athletic shoes, $30 shorts and $60 short sleeved billowy hippy-chic top and a $30 black mesh over-sized tote bag with colorful pinstripes out to dinner I notice the dress and appearance of those around me:  Flip flops!!! Shoes completely OFF!!! Cotton sleeveless tees (aka \"wife beaters\")!!! Tattoos! Nose rings! Baseball cap on BACKWARDS!!!  30 mins into my bar experience (which was delightful) he walked past me saying hello to a few patrons seated at the tables next to the bar. Then to those seated next to me at the bar. All the while it seemed it was a passive-aggressive attempt for me to notice him and acknowledge his awesome power.  He had the ability for those few minutes to redeem himself and change my negative impression of him but he was not going to directly initiate this possibility.  The other extremely negative aspect of what should have been an easy-going relaxing night out was the FLIES. Disgusting germ carrying filthy flies all around the bar. And if they're at the bar, they're certainly in the open exposed kitchen 15 feet from the bar. Just disgusting. Go to Strosnider's and spend $20 on a few Victor Fly Traps and follow the easy instructions.  Dear Rude host, Guess what Latino Napoleon? My family & I have not stepped foot in your establishment for 1+ year. Instead we go to all the other wonderful restaurants in SS, DC, Arlington, Alexandria & Fairfax. You lost yourself devoted regular customers who live just 2 miles away.",

The bartender, the gentleman that greets you and this one guy in a suit jacket that refills the cups of water were very awesome and wonderful it was not them, the bartender even gave us a free beer and was so informative about the steak cuts. We were going to be going back there for our weekend meals. It was the cooks who were hostile who just kept staring with disgusted angry looks where you can feel they did not want me and my brother there, I even tried smiling to see if it would make anything better but nothing. The guy who worked the grill was slamming our steaks on the grill with a disturbing look on his face. They just cut our steaks into pieces without even asking and I was willing to let it go and just eat. I took a couple of bites but they were just relentless on staring us down as if we owed them something. I could'nt even enjoy my meal ...it was a delicious steak and it was just a shame that I had to leave. Didn't pay nothing. I was upset and my brother explained to the guy who greeted us and left. We took our business to Texas road house where customer service was non judgemental and happy to have customers of all types. If you are multicultural and/or LGBT, do not go there.",

It seems over-seasoned and honestly not any better than a middle of the road steakhouse (though I paid $46 for a steak with no sides). I ate with a friend who had the burger and the burger was ground brisket, which sounds great but doesn't taste all that great- again seemed over seasoned. Man, let the quality meat speak for itself! Other issues- the service was not rude but was not attentive at all. I'm sorry, but when I pay $110 for steak, a burger, a $10 appetizer, ONE side, and one non-alcoholic drink, I expect GREAT service. I expect you to ask how everything was. If you had, I would have given you feedback instead of writing this review. A few people walked by the table but nobody asked how the food was. Waiter came by ONCE during the entire meal. It comes across that you just don't care when you don't bother to ask how a $110 meal was. It's interesting to me that there are no comments from the business on these reviews either- again, comes across like you don't care or aren't listening. At some point, that catches up with you. I hope somebody will even read this. Third point- it was deafening loud inside- and this was a Sunday evening. Like crazy loud. Not enjoyable at all for conversation.",

She had the branzino and fries and I had the hanger steak with a side of Brussels sprouts. The food was delicious though the Brussels sprouts were a bit undercooked. Unfortunately, when I got home about 30mins later, I got sick with all the classic food poisoning symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea...). Today I called the restaurant to let them know of my experience because it was definitely ruined. The manager, instead of expressing concern started rambling about how they keep all their food items separate and managed to ask me if I ended up in the hospital because otherwise there's nothing he can do. Seriously? I'd need to have gone to the hospital... Customer service goes a long way. My friend and I ran close to a $170 tab. He could have AT LEAST apologized and offered me a gift card. I guess I'll have to find that hibiscus mojito some place else.",

First let me start off saying the establishment is operated very well. If your going during the weekday a reservation isn't required I would think. However Friday, and Saturday nights I would definitely recommend grabbing a reservation.  The service is phenomenal. The menu has a french touch to it. If you don't understand anything on the menu, the waiters are happy to help. From what I've learned all their meats are aged well and prepared either that morning or even on earlier dates (steaks).  The price isn't too bad. I think it's about $$(1/2 $) or $$$. For a great meat it is well worth it. If you like the meat, they even sell their meats in their butcher shop. Personally that part is where I draw the line and say thats too expensive. I bought some bacon which was wrapped in suctions wrapped in plastic. There was about 6 pieces for about 8+ dollars....... yea.... pricey right?  Either way this place deserves 5 stars. Well deserved!",

I mean, for that price at least include the sides. The mash potatoes were simple as well, the one at Peri Peri taste better. To be honest the food made me feels horrible afterwards. The server was very friendly, it would have helped if he had explained the menu and price a bit more however. I would say that if you go there try the cheaper plates first, they are probably better.",

Waited 10 minutes at the bar, ordering a couple beers and paying for those up front at bartender's suggestion. After 10 minutes, seated at a 4-person table in the back, probably because my dining companion was wearing a sweatshirt and looked shabby. Waited 20 minutes for server. Beer overpriced and bleh. Got a glass of wine, overpriced and bleh. Ordered burger rare, got slab that reminded me of undergrad cafeteria. It wasn't bad, just salty and meh. Could not taste cheese at all, so skip that $2. Onion was ok. Fries were the tastiest part, though I wished they were from Boardwalk - they had the peanut oil taste but no salt whatsoever. There's no salt or pepper on the table (I guess on the theory that if you want to adjust the chef's spicings, you're a heathen). Server vanished so I just ate them and got the hell out.

The whole setup is just bad for a so-called steakhouse, cheap metal chairs bad service. This place would be perfect if it was just a salami and cheese spot especially since they're so proud of it,to take an classic cheeseburger and F\u20ac%K it up so bad was shocking! 80/20 angus beef patty works all over the world! Not here they grind up tough as hell brisket and then horribly over season it what a joke! The only reason me & my guests got burgers were because the steaks were so unattractive coming out to other tables unlike Ruth Chris Gibson's in Chicago etc.places were you would never even consider a Cheeseburger I was in Silver Springs last weekend for the first time & enjoyed all of my dining except this one.I'm not sure how this place is working but I will never lower my expectations of a steakhouse to except bad service sweating at my table flies everywhere because all the doors and windows are open on a 87 degree day flimsy cheap metal chairs not one beer I recognize on the menu to boot Never Again! Enjoy Silver Springs worst money all weekend. P.S forgot to mention the so called side salad.....I just want to scream thinking about it 80 cents worth of plain field greens tossed in some in house concoction in a bowl period don't remember what my bill was because it wouldn't have mattered I just wish I had drank them dollars instead would've been a lot happier",

The waiter told me it was $42 a pound.  I asked for a 16oz cut. I asked about the side dishes.  He stated everything is ala carte. I had a $6 baked potato.   We had water to drink. So for the bottom line. For 2 people with ribeye steak dinners the bill without tip was $153.00. For that price the atmosphere needs to be way better. For the price of the steak I should be getting a salad and a side with it. For that price I should be getting some dinner rolls before the meal. On the positive the steak did taste good and was tender. Thats all I can say on the positive. I would rather go to Texas Road House for my ribeye steak meal. At least there if my bill is that high its for double the people with drinks from the bar.",

It arrived extremely red in the center.  A burger another friend ordered arrived ten minutes after the rest of us got our food, even though other burgers were going out to other tables.  When the manager came to check on us I pointed out that my friend's steak was undercooked for how she ordered it.  He proceeded to explain to me that fresh meat is \"always red in the middle\" and their medium \"looks like that\" because their meat is so good.  He even said that I didn't know what a medium cook looks like and told me if I didn't like it, I could \"write it up on Yelp\".  We never received an apology for the late burger or the undercooked steak, nor did he offer a discount off out bill, which was nearly $200 excluding drinks.  There are too many other good places in the area to make it worth going back here.  Definitely would not recommend.",

Urban Butcher provides a variety of dishes meant to highlight their star attraction: high-end and delicious sourced meats (no hormones or antibiotics, full traceability, no unethical treatment) that are prepped in-house ... butchered, then cured or dry-aged (exactly what you may find from a quality local butcher). Except a place to lounge and get served cocktails / beers / wine while they cook and deliver meals in restaurant format.  I've tested a number of small-plate and entree dishes with a wide spectrum of meat choices, very good quality ingredients and preparation. Love the Steak Tartare (entree portioned), 48-hr Ox Tail Brisket, Terrines, Braised Meatballs, and their Sides collection (grilled Brussel Sprouts, so good). Steaks are 60-day dry-aged and you can easily experience sticker shock if you've not had higher-end steakhouse meals prior lol. Something to experience though, come with friends and share plates.  Nice bar although seating can be a premium at certain times. Good collection of beers, wine and cocktails. Friendly service from what I've experienced, but I've only eaten at the bar so far.  An upscale yet relaxed dining experience in Silver Spring. A welcomed addition. And looking forward to experiencing the retail Butcher aspect!",

Vegetarian options are also a pleasant surprise, with several options for the herbivores in your group.  There are several great cocktails available, including a great gin and tonic, a margarita, and a really interesting drink with absinthe.  I didn't have any wine but they did have it by the glass.  Bottled beers only right now but I'm sure draft will arrive soon looking behind the bar.  The bottled beer selection was good and had several unique/hard to find brews.

The concept is brilliant. It needs time to get it going. I will recommend it and will go back. Congratulations to Mr.Menizabal",

The cheeses and meats make great appetizers and have really enjoyed all the main dishes - great place to order lots of different dishes for sharing among a group. They've also got lots of solid cocktails, wines and beers. Service had some minor hiccups the first time we went, as expected for a brand new place, but was already markedly improved the second time we went back. A new favorite in Silver Spring.",

Off a side street a block south of The Sprung, I'm not sure there's been a more anticipated or heralded restaurant than Urban Butcher.  It is definitely deserving of the praise, but a few months under its belt should make it outstanding.  The meat centric, seasonal menu is a delight. Highlights included the pig tails, the ox brisket, pastrami and lamb saddle. A deep selection of cheeses and terrines was impressive.  The house made p\u00e2t\u00e9s were great, served with AMAZING grilled bread. However, the came completely unadorned. No cornichons. No jams. We asked for some mustard and they sent out some incredibly sharp delicious tasting stuff (it accompanies the pastrami), but why not send it out in the first place. The Chinese spareribs were great, but came attached to the brisket bone (not a more hand or sharing friendly St Louis cut). This wouldn't have been an issue if a steak knife came with it too.  The service is young and eager but a bit inattentive. For example, our ribs were delivered by another server and ours didn't show back up again for about 10 minutes while we waited for the steak knife. Same for the mustard. A host chatted with a regular customer while we tried to get his attention to no avail. I could cut a little slack if service was busier, but a Monday at 1800 isn't exactly the rush crowd.  The delicious food MORE than makes up for the lackluster service team, which I am sure will improve with time (the service at Jackie's and 8407 are indications that DTSS has great staff).  If you go, intend to lounge a bit and revel in the meaty goodness.",
