The one positive was the food was hot and of good temperature, but the pad Thai  tasted terribly bland, overly sweet, and the texture of it seemed like it must have been sitting for far too long as it was completely congealed. The green curry tasted ok, but also wasn't as good as we hoped. In the past, I have enjoyed eating at Paula's in their dining area, but after this experience I do not think I would order out from there anytime soon.",

I had the Boat Noddles and I can say that I will definitely be returning for another bowl. The meat was tender and packed with flavors. My father ordered the curry and definitely enjoyed the zing it had. He did have get another cup of water by the end of the meal (due to the spice) but happily enjoyed his meal. Prices were relatively low and and it is a good place for college kids to frequent. I would definitely recommend this if you want a good meal that is quick and easy as well as affordable .",

However, I tried this restaurant, it was very authentic and delicious. I could tell they put lots of effort for all their ingredients!! For example, the lemongrass and galangal were cooked softer so I could actually chew it unlike other restaurants!!! Ask them to make your food spicy. It is very spicy just as much as you can get in Thailand!!! There aren't many places that traditionally taste like this and are spicy and delicious in Thai restaurants in the United States, but this restaurant has a variety of menus and it's really great!! I was surprised to find that what I ate at this restaurant was much more delicious than the tom yang dream and pad thai I had in Thailand!! ^__^ I hope you enjoy it!!

It's one of the very rare places in Chicago that serves authentic, regional Thai food and it's very tasty.  The dining room isn't anything special but the food is amazing. Keep in mind that authentic Thai food is very spicy and some dishes have a strong aroma. That may not be for everyone hence a few bad review but most restaurants do to Thai food what Taco Bell does to Mexican food and Paula's does not so kudos to the chef :-)",

There were 4 of us for dinner. The meals were ample, we were all able to share what we had with each other. I rather enjoyed, nothing spectacular about it, just good basic Thai food. The place is BYOB, and the accept credit cards. My biggest issue with the place was a feeling cramped. A table for 4 , pushed back against the wall, with the other two seats in the only aisle the restaurant had. I wanted to go to the bathroom, but decided not to, when I could not find it, and it almost appeared that would have to go through the kitchen to get there. I could definitely go back for the food, but ambiance is a deterrent.",

For the people giving this place a bad rap, they've probably never eaten anything other than Pad Thai and don't know a thing about Thai cuisine.  Please go somewhere else, this is a small boutique restaurant catering to those wanting an authentic Thai cuisine experience, not that bland, sweetened Americanized crap certain \"Thai\" restaurants in Chicago like to pass off as Thai food.  I don't want this place to change a thing.  Thanks!",

A wonderful night at a nearby blues club unfortunately placed me in the path of this soon to be forcefully removed eatery. All I can say is, DONT EAT ANYTHING. Be careful to even breathe the air. Seriously, where do I begin? We ordered to basil leaf chicken and sesame chicken, and I was hit with regret before my butt even hit the uncomfortable chair I waited in. The entire establishment smells like wet dog. I watched a \"dine in\" customer walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom. When we finally got our food I was so eager to breathe fresh air that I didn't even notice we were overcharged. And honestly, regardless of what the menu says, one dollar would be overcharged for anything. I am a stingy man. I'm not proud to admit it, but I brought my business back to my local late night Chinese place after they got a 46 on their health exam, because you just can't beat 3 pounds of food laced in MSG for 8 bucks. Even so, I swear to you, based on smell and appearance alone I made the executive decision on behalf of my body to throw Paula's entire order away. That was the best decision I made all night. Please do yourself a favor and eat anything else. Or just give the money to a homeless person. But please tell them not to spend it at Paula's.",
