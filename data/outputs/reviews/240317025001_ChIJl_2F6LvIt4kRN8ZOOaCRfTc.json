We were extremely happy and will make this more regular!  So happy to see a local restaurant do such a good job with everything, from food quality, to pricing, to customer service.

We usually order panang curry, mango and sticky rice, kee mao fried rice and pad see ew - we've had this for dinner so many times I can't even count! Their food is delicious and well-priced and the staff are great.  We've eaten in the restaurant many times, but have really appreciated their takeout safety changes through the pandemic.  Everything feels very safe and the food continues to be delicious.",

When the order arrived it had shrimp and chicken. I politely called and explained to them that I am a vegan and I do not eat meat. I asked for a new order to be delivered. The lady on the phone took 15min to understand and indicated that she will call back to confirm if they are even able fulfill my request. I agreed and waited. When I didn't hear from the woman after 20mins, I called to inquire about my order. She lied (yes, lied, because I was by my phone the entire time) and said she called me back. She then took my address and and then the order over again and had the audacity to say that the order will take 45 to 1hr. Not to mention I a live less that 4min away from the restaurant. ALSO, she say to me that i have to put the food that was delivered back into the container and return it back to them. By this point I am extremely irritated therefore I tell her never mind, I would like a refund and she proceeded to tell me that I need to call Uber eats to get my refund (which I understood). Then I ask for a manager and the woman continuously reiterated that I need to call Uber eats for a refund. I continuously explained that I understood but I still wanted to speak to some type of management. She refused to put management on the phone and eventually told me to call Thursday to speak with someone name Nom. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!",

We came in January 2020 and the place was always cold because of the customer pick ups, and the comings and goings of the delivery staff. 2-3rds of the area is the narrow corridor. Even if there was good weather, it would be an uncomfortable and unsettling environment.  Food is pretty good and formulaic of the cultural cuisine but sweetened to the typical American diabetic-indusive taste, which subtracts from any sense of authenticity.  With the dinner so sweet, we had to skip dessert (and if you are diabetic, it'll  be wise for you too).  Even the plate of the hot food was cooled - nice for a salad, not for curry.  The small dining area and constant carryout customers taking priority over the diners, kills the ambiance, so this is not where I'd go to for a date again. And with only 4 parking spaces in front, makes pick up difficult.  Only my Shell Rewards brought me here.",

I usually order to go or have it delivered rather than dining in, but the restaurant itself seems to have a nice vibe when I've been waiting for my order. Of the appetizers, I like the curry puffs while my girlfriend lines the shrimp cakes. The girlfriend is much more habitual in her choice of entree, almost always getting the Pad Ka Pow with shrimp. On the other hand, I like switching it up and will usually choose between the Panang, Green and Massamun curries with either chicken or beef and the Nua Ka Ting (which is probably my single 'favorite' dish, although I like many).  Everything always tastes fresh and flavorful, the meat is always tender and juicy, and the high level of quality is extremely consistent. I can't remember having been disappointed even once. Getting extra rice with your entree is recommended, in my opinion, to absorb all the delicious sauce. Oh, and a Thai iced tea to wash it all down with is a good idea, too.  Cheers!",

The place seems to have a nice atmosphere but my impression is that the bathroom came across as greasy and started to notice the worn tables and extremely dirty concrete floor with pieces of food everywhere.   Arrived at 5pm which meant I was receiving a dinner price which was $2 more for many items.  Ordered the pad thai which arrived very quickly but rice was an additional in cost too.  This seems like a staple for any Asian meal.  Was not asked for a thai spicy level but was given spice condiments to add to meal.  Overall was not asked for spicy level and felt very expensive for the amount of food provided.  Actually felt a little offended regarding when asking if I could get a side of rice and told that costs extra.  Their business model with all the window stickers and even sign on the street was for delivery.  Environment felt very confining with the wall between the kitchen and the front half of the dining area.  This place is in need of a makeover and prices to compete with the numerous thai places in the area.",

They had a good balance of the remaining ingredients. I will come back and try something else and to truly get the experience of the restaurant. Until then, I would say this place is a 3.5 to 4 stars.  I was quite surprised that they would charge me 5 cents for the plastic bag. This would be the first restaurant that I've been to that has ever done so. Not sure how I feel about that.  The limited interaction with the staff was fine. Courteous and friendly.  Overall, I would recommend this place.",

I was on the fence about ordering it bc my experience with panang hasn't always been great.  While I like the combination of sweet and savory, most of the versions I've had have been cloyingly sweet and far too heavy.  Fortunately, I read few good reviews and decided to give it a shot.  So glad I did!  It definitely delivered the sweet and savory, but it was so much more.  There was a wonderful spiciness that I hadn't expected.  In addition to being incredibly flavorful, the sauce was the perfect consistency--not too thick/heavy but not too thin either.  I'll definitely go back to try more items on the menu.",

Went in there on a Monday night for take-out and ordered tom kha soup and pad thai w shrimp -- a pretty basic order that will tell me everything I need to know about a Thai restaurant. I should have known something was wrong when I smelled something smokey as I was driving home. It was coming from the takeout bag. Now nothing was actually burned, but there was a distinct burned oder coming off the pad thai. That wasn't the worst of it. The noodles were all shredded and congealed, as if these were pad thai leftovers that someone had then try to refry. Shrimp were overdone and tough. I could have done better myself with one of those packets from the store. Overall flavor was blah. The soup was not much better. Overly sweet. It also had tomatoes in it, which I did not care for. I won't be back and will be warning my friends.",
