However when it comes to their food I would say it is not worth it compared to the price. I ordered hot and sour soup- which was salty. Their stir fried beed salad is not how a stir fried beef salad looks or tastes like- they just put the stir fried beef over a regular salad (cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes onions etc). Lastly the wontons are no where near how classic wontons are. It was super thick and doughy. I was looking forward to this restaurant but unfortunately ended up being disappointed. However I appreciate that they are trying to settle this new restaurant. I hope they will upgrade the food quality compared to the prices. I would definitely like to go back if they do so.
