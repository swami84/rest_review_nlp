I'm very surprised that they did not have a cocktail menu. I want to like the place. It's unique, but honestly not good enough for me to return. It IS a good value. Lots of food. We each had steak, apple pie and we split the wine. $65 pre tip, $80 post tip. The bread was a bit crusty. The staff writes on the table cloth. Not fancy. FYI they have an off menu vegetarian portabello mushroom cap entree.",

The menu is simple, no fuss; just tell them how you like your steak cooked and you're good to go!  First comes the bread which puts most other crusty bread to shame. It's delicious with a solid crunch in every bight. Next, a salad that is of surprising quality for a place you come mostly for steak. It's simple, elegant, and deliciously tender which offers a delightful contrast from the crunchy bread. Last, the steak and fries. The steak is tender and juicy and comes with their renowned secret steak sauce that's good enough to drink. The fries are similar to McDonald's golden treasures and pair wonderfully wilh the steak and help soak up the juices. Just when you think it's done, round two of steak and fries comes out, complete with more steak sauce.  Pro tip: You can ask for more bread while you have your steak to take full advantage of soaking up that steak sauce.",

The steak and eggs is definitely the best entree in my opinion since you get the steak and fries plus eggs cooked your way. Steak is nothing special, doesn't stand out but certainly not bad, but the sauce for the steak is tasty.  Out of the starters I think the green salad is the best, it's a good size and is very tasty. When you add in the bottomless coffee and mimosas it is easily worth the of price.",

There is only 1 item on the menu, so if you don\u2019t enjoy the lean type of hanger steak they serve here, this is not the restaurant for you.  I think it\u2019s the best value steak frites I\u2019m Bethesda.  The deserts are hit or miss.  If you like humongous, sweet cakes like those served at The Cheecake Factory, you will enjoy all the cakes and the sundae here.  If you\u2019re looking for a smaller sized dessert with more tartness, go for the key lime pie.  Wine list is limited but has a good selection with good prices.",

Decent beer selection as well as several dessert options (at additional charge). Six of us ate for about $200 with tip.  The food was delicious, the waitstaff helpful and friendly, and the environment casual without being raucous. The dining space is small, so call ahead of make a reservation (though we were able to get our table on Saturday night at 1830 with no problem).  They do have a weekend brunch, but I haven't tried that, so can't comment.  This is a clever addition to the multitude of Bethesda dining options. Great option for someone who wants a quick, easy, delicious meal.",

My wife and I live in the area so on Wednesday night we decided to finally give it a shot.  It was a friendly neighboor environment from the moment we were greeted at the door. Suraj was our server and he couldn't have been more accommodating.  I wasnt sure about the secret sauce at first so I requested to have it come on the side. However, let me say. Not necessary!  My wife and I both basically licked the plate clean.  If you use some of that outstanding bread to sop up the remaining sauce on the plate, your life will be better because of it.  So here's the thing though.  The meal comes with a second helping!  Can you beleive that?!  It caught us completely by surprise and almost rendered me incapable of ordering desert.  Of course we had to though.  My wife wanted key lime pie so we split a slice.  It may have been the best key lime pie I've ever had but by this point there was nothing shocking about that.  Wonderful experience.  Excellent staff.  We will be back for sure!",

At very least the steak sauce should have been ptional. The meal was also not kid friendly at all. Apart from the sauce issue, the steak is seasoned with blackpeper, not very kid friendly (and there is no other option for kids).",

The service was great. we were immediately greeted us with a smile. Our main server was very attentive, frequently refilling our waters and mimosas. He did a great job of explaining the menu and was even kind enough to let me taste the vegetarian option- mushrooms- to help me decide if I wanted to try the streak or go vegetarian for that meal. Other severs frequently stopped by to check on our table and were very friendly.  The food was amazing. The fruit was fresh. I tried to vegetarian option- portabella mushroom. It was very delicious, not undercooked and came with a very flavorful red sauce. I also tried the steak and eggs. I was happy to see my eggs were cooked exactly how I had asked, this doesn't happen often during brunch since most places are very busy so it was a nice surprise. I also tried the eggs Benedict. I have never had a better benedict. Instead of the traditional ham, the plate came with a perfect blend of protabella mushrooms and steak in a heavy thick gravy type sauce. Talk about an explosion of flavors! I cant express enough how good the food was.  It also came out warm and I did not have to wait a long time to get the meal.  The prices were also great. We had bottomless brunch and food for about $25. This is a steal compared to other brunch spots in Bethesda. And they arent stingy on the mimosas either, the server was very attentive to bring out refills whenever he saw the glass just below half full.  The environment was also lovely. We sat outside, I had a nice view, there wasn't that much foot traffic that would make one feel uncomfortable.  Overall it was a great experience. I would rate Medium Rare a 10 and would recommend it to everyone!",

We went to Medium Rare for dinner, and were massively disappointed. The atmosphere was crowded and loud, with poor lighting and zero privacy.  Also, did I mention that the table cloths were PAPER. Clearly no expense was spared. Our bill (for two) was $60, including a $6 coke. You would think they could find the money to splurge and purchase something other than paper tablecloths.  The food did arrive promptly, and the waitress was helpful enough. However, the water was lukewarm, and the bread and salad (dressed mere hours before) were underwhelming.When it comes to the main course, the steak had the taste and texture of a cheap cut and the shoestring french fries (ore-ida, by taste) were reminiscent of an after-school meal. Our second helping (?) was not prepared correctly, but it was promptly fixed and then served... out of a cookie sheet. For those who enjoy a spectacle, please take note that anniversaries and birthdays are punis-- celebrated with sparklers which stink up the entire restaurant moments after ignition. Finally, to top off the entire evening, we were presented with our check, and two pieces of DUBBLE BUBBLE BRAND BUBBLE GUM?? Seriously, who serves rock hard bubble gum from the 80's in place of an after dinner mint or chocolate? The entire experience was bizzare. The two stars in this review are for the somewhat friendly (if busy) staff, and the cleanliness of the location.",
