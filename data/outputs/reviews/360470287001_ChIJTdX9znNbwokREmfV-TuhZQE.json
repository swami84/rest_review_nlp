I would probably go here a lot, but when i ordered something that should be gluten free and i let them know im gluten free just to be careful, they told me there boss seas everything in the restaurant has gluten in it. I was shocked because it simple was not true.   They just don't know what gluten is or they just didn't know what was in the food they serve.   I had to ask them what was in the curry that had gluten? The girl told me the curry came from a can. So I new it was probably safe. But thats not a good way to advertise food. I think they don't know what is in the food because its not fresh. Its all pre made but that meanstjey can look at the ingredientson the can. Cand curry should be gluten free. They are just being lazy. Rice is gluten free and they told me it had gluten. I was so hungry.  So after asking them lots of questions abouth the ingredients and anoying my boyfriend to the point that he didn't want to eat there anymore,  I learnd the curry was safe to eat. But this was so annoying.  And they really did not want to help me. So rude. The curry was the best in the neighborhood so far, but we don't have meany restaurants in the area.  A restaurant should know what is in there food. Its not that hard to mark a few idems for different food allergies and put it on the menu.  Or at least ask the kitchen what does not have soy sauce and what is not thickend with flour or fried in flower. Its not like i was at an Italian restaurant asking for gluten free food. And truthfully i would probably find better service at an Italian restaurant.",

We came here for dinner - it was a really nice vibe. The music was playing top 40 hits which I found nice. There are TVs above the bar and that particular night the Grammy\u2019s were on so we were appreciative of that. They are also able to host private events in the back, there is a lot of space! Food: We ordered Thai Iced Teas and those felt a little bit watery for my taste but not bad whatsoever. I had the red curry with chicken, it was fantastic. Felt like it was a nice portion size too, not too much and not too little. Bae had a pork dish, the meat was fatty and delicious, lots of flavor. For desert we had coconut pudding. It was warm, not very sweet, and with complex layers of flavor. Check the place out yourself!",
