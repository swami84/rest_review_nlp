The caterpillar roll and American Dream roll are especially out of this world! Food is incredibly fresh and consistently good and accurately prepared. Really can't say enough good things about this place and its super friendly staff! Wish they had a location closer to us for dine-in once covid passes but I'm very happy we found this spot! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf63\ud83c\udf63",
