The monkfish karaage was a particular highlight out of the small plates. The sushi choices were also outstanding, with some interesting garnishes and touches on the more delicate fishes to up the flavor complexity.  The service is extremely helpful and friendly, and the food came relatively quickly. The ambiance was also very nice and all staff were properly masked. Easy 5/5 for me and would definitely visit again.",

Both were excellent, and the chef skillfully prepared and even lightly charred the exterior before serving it.

While that's great, if someone asks for siracha in a Japanese restaurant, it's expected that they should have, if not siracha, then some other type of hot sauce. Hot beverages were served in cups that got too hot to hold; insulated cups would be better to avoid discomfort.  The food itself was very good, with an excellent blend of classic authentic Japanese cuisine and modern flair. A bit pricey considering Google's rating indicated $$, more like $$$. The service was fast, friendly and efficient. I would recommend trying it for yourself.",

I walked in and asked for a bar seat with no reservations thankfully they sat me in front of Chef taiki! I did the Omakase cause I love watching the chefs do their work while I just look at how cool it is. Happily paid a bit less than 100 dollars for what I ordered tuna tasting, Omakase and some extras at the end.. I need to come back!  Updated on 2/17/19 Brought the girlfriend here for late valentine's day. I'm happy to see the space so busy even at 6o clock. I walked in with no reservation and still was able to see on the bar. It was super busy but food and service quality didn't suffer I love their cocktails the lemonade sake! Sorry forgot to take a picture of the cocktails",

On the other: surprisingly pricey for the neighborhood and what you get. I mean, omakase sounded like a really good deal when I thought it involved the chef offering up one piece at a time and all - but it wasn't that, it was a very good \"sushi platter\" assembled and handed over with a quick rundown of what each fish was. For a completely ala carte sushi platter - I ordered the gazpacho separately when informed that nothing else comes with the omakase - well, it's a less appealing proposition for the price. Very different experience: you're not getting each piece the moment it's made, nor the interaction with the chef, nor the pacing which arises from that experience. Eating alone that evening, I found myself finished very quickly, even though I slowed down to savor each bite and paused between them, reflecting and cleaning my palate with ginger and sips of wine.  So instead of the omakase bargain I hoped for (\"ah, it's a discount for being on unglamorous Nevins St in the shadow of the projects\") it was a lot to spend on a quick (and good, definitely) sushi dinner which had me in and out pretty fast.",

He provided cucumber water and gave a nice description of what he had to drink. Our drinks came out fairly quickly and in nice glasses. We then got to order our meal from master chef Taiki himself. We ordered miso, a tuna roll, and 10 pieces of nigiri. The miso came out quickly and was perfect temperature to eat immediately. He then prepared our tuna roll in front of us and laid it on a big leaf as a driving plate (maybe a rubber tree leave?) After we finished the roll he then made piece by piece and laid it in front of us. I don't even know how to describe how delicious it tastes as I probably won't do it justice. After the nigiri he made us a small Japanese cake dish on the house, wiped his knife clean, and thanked us. The ambience was amazing, great lighting with very cool tunes going on. The price was a little high but it's absolutely worth it. I cannot recommend this place enough but can only a few of you guys come to help his business but not enough so I don't have to wait to eat there?",

However, my experience here has been outstanding and has given me a more positive outlook and eating a staple Japanese food. The wait for food was not long at all, considering what we got, however much time spent on it probably wouldn't matter (it was that good)! The texture of the fresh fish was exquisite. I would highly recommend the mussel shishito as a starter, the \"Omakase\" (this means the \"chefs pick\") sushi, the Blue Fish Tuna tasting (which consists of 5 different types of textured/tasting tuna), the ika (squid) sushi was one of my daughters favorite, and the tamago br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert was the ultimate way to put a halt to our ovehelming sushi feast!  Additionally, considering its location... it's truly a hidden gem!",
