Two others were not put in the box because I was told they were too hard. He put those boxes aside) and didn't really have a lemon flavor. I had high hopes for the Raspberry but the dough was dry and the jam a little too hard.  The boxes seemed to not be very well organized, nor labeled. It could be beneficial to organize them all by flavor from oldest to newest instead of picking them from different boxes. I'm sure that when they're fresh, they are amazing. Wishing them well on their growth; we need more shops like this around this area.",

The first time we ordered from them, way back in the spring or summer, the macarons tasted great. The texture of the meringue was perfect, and the filling have the macarons just enough moisture.  However, we ordered from them again today. Not only did they give us the wrong flavors, but the macarons reeked of mold and staleness! Two of the macarons were shaped and made the way macarons should be, but they were clearly very old and dehydrated. The rest of the macarons were abnormally large, and the \u201cmeringue\u201d had more of an under-baked cake texture. The most worrisome part was that both the filling and meringue components smelled and tasted like a cold Eastern European basement.  We didn\u2019t eat our macarons, but did gently taste (and spit out) each one to give the most honest review possible. These ones were BAD.  Please don\u2019t order macarons here. There are many more businesses you can support that sell actual macarons. These will give you some pretty bad food poisoning.  EDIT IN RESPONSE  TO THE OWNER: First of all, we ordered off DoorDash but checked the address. We ordered from here. I have no idea how your recipe and process could be consistent given that two of our macarons were small, made of meringue with a slight crunch, and colored beautifully. While the other 8 were gigantic, soggy, and had a completely different texture + taste in the meringue. The only complaint we had about the two small ones were that they were super stale and dried out. They were clearly old. As a person who has WORKED IN A FRENCH BAKERY WITH REAL BAKERS FROM FRANCE, I can tell which macarons have subpar quality. Please at least have the dignity not to sell macarons that smell and taste of mold to your customers. FYI my partner ate more of the macarons than I did and actually got very sick. This is an update from after the review was posted.",

I remember the very first time I tried them from a bakery store in Queens it was the most disgusting macaroons I ever tried from that place that made me very skeptical about the taste and even trying it again, but once I found out that macaroons coffee bar sells them and found it was fresh and made by the owner and tried them and oh boy \ud83d\ude0c I fell in love \ud83d\ude3b with macaroons. I love the taste of it, the quality of it and the different flavors are *yummy* \ud83d\ude0b . Not only that their sandwiches and food are tasty and fresh ALWAYS. I always buy from here whenever I can. Been buying food from this place ever since they opened. I definitely RECOMMEND this place.  \ud83d\udc9b\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
