It\u2019s empty.\u201d So I walked in and sat at the bar.  \u201cSlow night?\u201d I asked. It was around 8 \u201cNo you just missed the rush.\u201d The bartender replied.  It does always seem busy whenever I pass this place. Luckily, there were other events going on in town, I was able to grab a seat at the bar.  This is my first time at a Persian restaurant and really had no idea what to get or expect. I studied the menu and decide, oh kebab... I know what that is. So I ordered a beef kabab. I started my meal with hummus. Best hummus I ever had. It\u2019s very light in taste - smooth with a hint of garlic and lemon. The pita bread was warm and soft. Wish there were more it because it was so good with the hummus.  Beef Kebab - I was a little disappointed with this one. Two grilled ground beef served with saffron rice, tossed greens and grilled tomato. The beef kebab was on the dry side. I expected some juicy meat as others have described it. It wasn\u2019t tonight. (I had some hummus left so I dipped a few pieces of beef kebab in it, lmao). The rice was satisfying, the tossed greens, fresh!  The bar did not disappoint. Three glazed of vodka tonic and I was feeling good. Definitely better than the place I intended of going.  Oh yeah, I did have a cheese cake. I don\u2019t remember if it was good or not. (I stopped taking notes - because, vodka!) I can tell you it was perfectly cut - look at the photo!",

I started with an old favorite of the Persian cucumber salad. It lacked flavor and the herbs that I'm familiar with. I could barely taste the mint and fresh lime. Next we shared the hummus. It was just ok and didn't have enough bread for the small portion. My entree was the Schwarma which was not what expected. I guess I didn't read that it was a little crumbly meat with copious amounts of lettuce and way too much house dressing. Again I think a restaurant is only as good as the food they are trying to traditionally represent. This place miss the mark for me..",

The Beef and Lamb Shawarma was Huge, fresh, delicious, and filling.  The restaurant itself is pretty small with paid parking in the back.  I will be purchasing as many Groupons as I can until it expires and will be back with or without a Groupon. Fairly priced.",

We look forward to going there again very soon.",
