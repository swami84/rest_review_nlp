Unfortunately we arrived 5 min after 3:00 pm and they could no longer serve us Brunch, so we ordered a croque madame and some chocolate croissants. On the part of the croque madame there was no problem, it was quite good. On the contrary, the croissants are the same that you can buy for $ 5 10 units. They were pretty dry and not worth the $ 6 they were asking for. In total they ask you $ 3 for each unit ... it should correct the price or improve the quality of the croissant. I can't say that's why I'm not going back, I'll surely try again, I just hope it won't take more than an hour to bring us two simple dishes like last time. If the timing and the croissant improve, I would not hesitate to give it the highest rating.  (Original) La verdad es que no tuvimos ning\u00fan problema  este restaurante.

Our table at the end of the patio was right next to the trash cans and the smell wafted over with every breeze, yet it still felt pretentious as our waitress pressured more expensive wine and additional appetizers. We got our drinks and then had to wait nearly an hour for our appetizer to come, which we were told was due to a \u201ccomputer glitch.\u201d Foie gras app was fine, but after an hour of waiting without service the smaller-than-average portion didn\u2019t come close to hitting the spot. Entrees came about 20 minutes later; mine was cold and my date\u2019s steak came way overcooked. Giving 2 stars because of the attempted bold menu and high end plating, as well as that towards the end our waitress seemed to realize how miserable we were and became overly nice.  However, if you\u2019re charging city prices in Brooklyn and this is the best experience you can provide...stick to take-out.",

The dinner itself (a medium rare steak, potatoes, butter and herb mixture, and salad) was very smooth and tasty - the steak was actually cooked perfectly and the salad had a beautifully complimentary tartness to contrast the flavors in the butter - and the portions were good for one. The desert of creme brulee was nice; the sugar-coating was a little on the thick side and the custard was a very thin layer, almost too thin, but it was still delicious. The cocktail (an egg white frothy creme with celery and rum) was fantastic and tangy and refreshing after the whole meal.",

After being seated very quickly, we were left to ponder their menu that had a host of interesting dishes. Some dishes of note were their smoked fish with fish eggs, foi gras, and an entire roast chicken.  Their mussels were honestly sublime, perfectly cooked in a wonderful cream and onion sauce, paired with delectable potatoes in duck fat. If you are ever in the mood for fries, come here for the potatoes instead. Friendly service by all staff. Only thing that could be improved is if they could the mussels out faster",

        "caption": "I always like to start my reviews by prefacing that my experience at each location doesn't reflect that of my party or others that have been to or will attend said restaurant, bar, etc. That being said, my experience at Le Garage was exceptional. The space itself is chic without coming off as pretentious. Cozy, modern, subtle, and inviting (but not obnoxiously inviting) are the words that come to mind when I imagine the location. The hostess was sharp and attentive, and the same can be said for the rest of the staff. Our server was very professional in the way she handled our table. Not pushy, not overly-friendly, and very knowledgeable about the food and drink selections. The food itself was fantastic. Portion sizes were perfect, the balance of rich and light made each bite very satisfying without being overwhelming. Clearly the back of house has a high degree of of both knowledge and practice in regards to French fare as was displayed by their semi-open kitchen which was a nice  touch. Personally I love to watch chefs work. We started with a bottle of the Domaine Jean Baptiste S\u00e9nat, Minervois, 2016 as well as the potatoes in duck fat with b\u00e9arnaise, the smoked fish rillette with trout roe, and the winter endives with pears, roasted walnuts, Bleu d\u2019Auvergne, and breadcrumbs. All of which I can foresee myself ordering again as they were an excellent way to start the meal without being too abrasive on the palette or too heavy in the stomach. Great for eating family style as well. Our main course consisted of the wild mushroom risotto with pecorino and truffle butter plus the gnocchi with country ham, crispy shallots, comte cheese, and truffle butter. Both were fantastic and I'd be remiss is I didn't say that the gnocchi was among the best winter dishes I'd ever eaten. Overall, Le Garage is a top notch French restaurant with plenty of tricks up its sleeves to keep the flavors and atmosphere interesting and evolving. I only with I could thank Rachel and Catherine Allswang personally for putting a smile on my typically dour face.",

However, the food and drinks are just ok. 2 out of 4 cocktails are pre-made and bottled from a local cocktail place, but the best of the 4 is actually one of the pre-made. The fried paniess were just soggy, and doughy. There\u2019s not special about  foie gras, and I feel like they just throw in 2 slices of bread and called it a dish. The hanger steak is really good tho, perfectly cooked and season, it\u2019s the only thing that I will recommend. The duck breast has crispy skin and good flavor but it is too chewy for my taste and gave my jaw muscle too much of a work out. The ravioli is pretty good but it\u2019s less than warm when they bring it to the table.",

The rabbit was just divine, the mix of vegetables and resulting flavors with the rabbit perfectly roasted was a true culinary experience. The hanger steak was excellent and the Bordeaux a very good value for the price. Obviously the cr\u00eame brul\u00e9e was made to perfection with a torch (cream is meant to be cold underneath the crust). Very friendly staff and efficient service. Very nice atmosphere and d\u00e9cor. No idea why the Michelin guide only gave them 2 forks. In my humble opinion, they definitely deserve one star. Highly recommended.",

We came here on a Saturday night and unfortunately it was a bit dead in the place, the bar had people sitting at it, but most of the tables were empty.  Although opening within (i believe) the last 6 months and being a bit off the main street, I don't believe it was empty because of not being well known. I think the prices for this spot in the neighborhood are just a bit too high to have a regular or even solid customer base right here. With main courses around $20-25 and apps $5-10... it really is somewhere that you need to go for a \"reason\" (celebration, nice date, etc).  With that said though... the food was really really good, and the cocktails were spectacular. The risotto (oddly enough, one of the best priced items at $18) was great and something I will come back for. Although my girlfriend loved her dish (roasted duck), we both didn't feel like it was a $26 dish, but more in the 15-20 range instead.  The neighborhood is obviously changing and so this restaurant might just be jumping the gun a bit.  TL;DR - Food: 5/5 - Cocktails: 5/5 - Service: 5/5 - Atmosphere: 4/5 - ....however, Price: 3/5 maybe",
