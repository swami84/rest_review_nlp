I chose to go here on Valentine\u2019s Day and honestly I wish I would\u2019ve just dope dashed something . I ordered the filet Oscar which comes with asparagus and roasted potatoes nothing absolutely nothing even had salt on it the potatoes where so dry they looked dehydrated my steak was cooked properly but had absolutely no seasoning even the holiday  sauce was bland my fianc\u00e9 ordered the scallop and shrimp risotto it was so under cooked she couldn\u2019t eat it but the shrimp and scallops which was only two each and one of the scallops was raw in the middle . My two glasses of Hennessy and ginger ale probably contained a total Of one shot of alcohol between the two and my poor waitress I believe she must have been very new she couldn\u2019t keep Up with the tables 150$ down the drain and my Valentine\u2019s Day seems incomplete because of the way to have to plan now we can\u2019t just go somewhere else it\u2019s sad but I will never return",

They must be understaffed during covid. We were comped our appetizer but definitely wish we had better service. Atmosphere is okay, it wasn\u2019t quite the romantic Valentine\u2019s Day vibes I was hoping for. The one in Alexandria, VA is much nicer, but I guess it\u2019s because this is Baltimore.",

I thought they'd laugh in our face and send us on our way, but they took care of us so we'll and handled the whole thing in stride.  If you dine in, you MUST try the flaming crab dip appetizer. It literally arrives at your table on fire. And the naan bread that's included with it is FANTASTIC!  Other recommendations: the softshell crab sandwich is excellent and the burger is to die for.

I had disappointing interactions with the hostess and the manager, which I will chalk up to the heat as it was nearly 100 degrees that day and because of mandated outdoor seating, we were all slowly baking.  Additionally,  I'm noticing that Covid has negatively affected customer service at restaurants in general.  However, my server, Elias, was very pleasant, accommodating, and made great suggestions.  My party ended up leaving before our meal was served.   Therefore, I cannot review the food. Will not return to this location but, would still like to visit Annapolis.  If you choose to visit this location, I would suggest you wait until indoor dining resumes as the restaurant has no naturally provided shade and the umbrellas and tables cannot be moved so you'll still end up in the sun on a hot day.",

As expected it was busy and there were 2 bartenders at the Bar. I tried Dior about 5 minutes to get their attention. The male bartender ended up walking from behind the bar to attend to tables the female bartender who I now know as Rebecca didn't look our way for while but eventually came over. When she arrived I told her I knew it was after 7 but I had been trying to get her attention for a while so I'd like to still order at Happy Hour prices. Her response well I can get you a drink because that's my bad but I can't do anything about the food. I promptly asked for a manager and she responded \" Yea I got a lot going on\" she proceeded to go back to the other side of the bar . She alerted the manager I believe his name was James who came over apologized and said he would honor the prices.  There were 2 other woman sitting in the side of me they heard the interaction and said their experience was the same TERRIBLE. She was not attentive and wasn't particularly friendly. My friends who had gotten their before me shared the same sentiment. Now I don't want to make this racial but what I will say she appeared to be super friendly and attentive to the folks at the bar that were facing the center none of whom were people of color. Everyone who was sitting at the end of the bar was women of color.  Just think that should be noted. The food came out it was ok nothing to memorable but not terrible enough to send back. I had wings, saffron mussels, and fried green tomatoes ( those were actually good). James the manager was bright spot super friendly and I think he did a decent job of trying to make things better. However Rebecca needs to work on her attitude and attentiveness. I can't remember the last time I was so offended that I didn't tip. But this time I certainly won't forget.",

We had a reservation from opentable so we were seated right away.  They had a jazz band playing and this added to a relaxed yet exciting brunch day.  They have $2 mimosas for brunch. However they are premade and taste like a pure glass of OJ. So we decided to purchase a bottle of prosecco instead with a miniature carafe of OJ. Our server was great btw.  Here is the downside in addition to the mimosas.  The food is hit or miss.  Bacon- not cooked and full of fat. Fried chicken was very good. Grits were the bomb. Seafood omelet underwhelming. Steamed shrimp overcooked. Oysters were good. Potatoes(home fries) were tasteless and cold. Beef was extremely rare and fatty. Sausage patties were yummy. Salmon... what salmon? They never refilled it. The tongs to pick up the food were adult proof. Very difficult to use.  After we ate we ordered a bloody Mary.  Nothing worth remembering.  Overall I am glad I came. The location is prime and great for a walk on the harbor after eating.  I don't think the food was worth the price paid but it wasn't aweful.  Food 2.5* Service 4.5* Ambiance 5* Drinks 2.5*  So my overall rating is 3.6*  It's a great 1st time experience.  However I don't know that I would come back. Well definitely not for brunch.",

Our waiter was nice enough, but weirdly both over and under attentive. We were in and out of the restaurant, after 3 courses, in under an hour.  Food was fine, but I don't think the price matches what we received. It was above average, but for the prices on the menu I expect a stellar meal.

First off, the atmosphere seemed great, very comfortable, not too loud and some nice decoration. The waiter we got was attentive and helpful, fully explained specials, drink options, etc. Now we are from Buffalo, NY, so when I saw chicken wings for an appetizer, I thought we would try something from another area. We ordered the Sweet-chili BBQ Garlic wings... an interesting combination. They arrived quickly and they were THE ABSOLUTE BEST WINGS WE HAVE BOTH EVER HAD. We told the waiter right away who clearly passes the word on to the manager as he came over to us to talk. I explained how incredible they were and told him to pass my compliments to the chef. Not only did he do that, he brought the chef out to talk to us; it's great to see he was truly getting recognition for what he made. In passing, my wife mentioned how this was our first day married and that he helped make it a great day. I ordered a burger which was spectacular, and she a Southwest chicken salad which she fully enjoyed as well. While we were eating, the chef himself came out with a dessert for each of us, and wrote congrats on the plate; and of course it was on the house. He wished us well on our marriage and was incredibly respectful and kind. This is the kind of restaurant I will recommend to anyone and everyone. I will be back here the next time I'm remotely near Baltimore. This was an A++.",
