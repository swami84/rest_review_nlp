It\u2019s Jamaican cuisine with a sophistication that sets it apart from the rest. customer service was on point, Edward took very good care of us...the ambience is one to take in! Music gave me nostalgia nice mix! The temperature was perfect. Bathrooms very clean and smelled good. Kid friendly environment social distancing is maintained the entire time; I was able to enjoy dining with my daughter and friend without any interaction with other patrons. Brooklyn needed this!! Thank you Chef Simpson and staff!!!",

Fire stick pepper shrimp - Cod fish fritters - Jerk chicken cheese fries (oh man) our favorite was the JCCF and that was just appetizers. Dinner- 20 oz Dry Aged Cajun Bone in Ribeye and Jerk Oxtail over Macaroni Cheese pie delicious. The finale - Upside down Chocolate bread pudding with vanilla ice cream was the home run for me. Our aim is to go back as much so we can say we had everything on the menu.",

We also had the salmon which wasn\u2019t fresh it taste like it was cooked then refrigerated and reheated again to serve ( like frozen bag salmon ) Overall the food is way too expensive to not taste good , we can get these meals at your local mom and pop restaurants for half the price and the taste is so flavorful .

This is to save the day.   Show was able to find last minute reservations at The Simpsons Restaurant. From the door and you that this was a turnaround from the start of my day.We were greeted with warmth and hospitality. Our server Yannick was on point checking in to make sure our meals were to our satisfaction. I had the Escovitch Snapper with veggies and Bammy. It was prepared just right.  Everything was flavorful and fresh and still hot. I'm the pickiest person this side of the Mississippi so I was definitely impressed by the  presentation and taste of everything. My sister's were shocked that I had no complaints. They also enjoyed their meals that i sampled too. They also get an \"A\" in ambience and music selection. The manager Lance was super personable and visited with all the guest. A-1  Service. Yannick, Lance and a few other staff members brought out a cake \ud83c\udf82and  sang Happy Birthday (Stevie Wonder edition \u2764). What a wonderful ending to my day!!!.

My husband and I arrived around 7:30pm on a Sunday, February 21. The restaurant was fairly empty-besides us, there were two tables with large parties and about four other couples dining in. We were greeted warmly and completed Covid protocols (temperature check, sanitizer and tracing info). We were seated in a booth and introduced to our server. We ordered the codfish fritters for an appetizer. They were good but a little on the crunchier side than I prefer. I had the jerk chicken entree which was really tasty though I wished it were made the authentic way on a grill and not in the oven. The portion of chicken was filling. My husband had the curry salmon which he enjoyed. The restaurant is still awaiting a liquor license so they could only offer mocktails and fountain drinks. I had the sorrel which was tasty but literally took two sips and it was done-for $4, the drinks should come in larger sizes. For dessert, we tried the cake which also tasted good but we couldn\u2019t finish it because it was unnecessarily covered in a bunch of chocolate and caramel syrup which made it too sweet and was totally unnecessary. They syrup was not included in the description of the dessert. When I told my server about that, he said, \u201cOh, they just want to make it pretty\u201d. My husband wanted an ice cream scoop to go with the cake however the menu lists gelato, not ice-cream. The server couldn\u2019t really tell the different and insisted that it was ice-cream. He ended up not getting it because  he didn\u2019t want to have gelato. I have high hopes that The Simpson will be a great restaurant once they work out some of the kinks. Dinner for two here is pretty pricey considering no alcohol was consumed. Still, I would recommend that you give it a try. The customer service is good and the chef seems like a wonderful person though we did not get to meet him during our visit.",

Our server Monty was everything; energy on a 100; he made sure to check in on us often as we was waiting for our food. First off, the appetizers was AMAZING; the jerk wings, jerk chicken cheese fries and cod fish fritters...delicious. Then our entree was even better. Definitely will be back soon. Monty, thank you for the well service. I also want to extend my thanks to the owner Wenford for exceptional services as he was prompt and professional in taking care of my experience there. Congratulations to The Simpson for bringing some sweetness and good food  during these difficult times.",
