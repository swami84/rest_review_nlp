My date was craving some oysters and to our surprise the restaurant was obviously a seafood haven because of the decor. The restaurant is beautiful, looks new. Before walking inside I was questioned my age (sort of rude the way asked). We sat and waited for water, waited to be asked drinks, served our montauk summer ales, (a great beer) we waited so long for our drinks the foam on the cup sank and left this foam ring on the glass. We ordered oysters, the oysters so fresh, mignonette, fresh horseradish and Cocktail sauce amazing. I tried to ask server the type of oysters we were having but she zoomed away. We waited a long time for our  oyster shells to be taken away and place our mains. We ordered a clam chowder, the lobster bisque and fries and another round of drinks. 3 items, and unbelievably we only received our soups. I was waiting for the server to come to our table and check on us but never did. We finished our soups and I finally got to mention the fries she said \u201cthey\u2019re coming\u201d and zoomed away. We intended to have more oysters and another round of beers for our dessert. But what was the point we\u2019d we sitting and waiting forever. When I went to tell the server nvm the fries I\u2019ll take the check the food runner brought the fries. No longer interest by this point. The food was great. The clam chowder a little heavy on the mire poix but still great, fresh. Service not good. Service so terrible they decided to tip themselves more than what I agreed to. Which has never happened me, EVER. Smh. 2 stars because of the food and restaurant decor. Won\u2019t be returning. I rather other great restaurants like Cull & Pistol, Burger & Lobster, Grey Lady, lobster joint, mermaid inn.",

The most important to the bubbly lovers in us was the fact that we order the blue baby champagne bottle and they brought a flat glass with no bubbles; then we asked for the actual blue bottle and they charged us for the rose\u0300 version. You know when you send back the glass with no bubbles, you can\u2019t even be honest about the fact that the soup was unacceptable, and you feel bad to ask why does the small crab crispy rice appetizer is more expensive than the uni lobster pasta because there was already something you sent back.
