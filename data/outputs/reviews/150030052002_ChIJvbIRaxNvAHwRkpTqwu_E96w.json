        "caption": "Great authentic Chinese restaurant in Honolulu\u2019s Chinatown. Recommended by a friend of my son, I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews.  Service was good even if there was a bit of a language barrier. Orders are written in Chinese (I believe), so it was difficult for me to confirm what was ordered when the server showed me what was written down in an effort to make sure our order was correct. The order was correct.  We got lots of food, at least twice as much as we were able to eat. Food came out to the table as it was ready (i.e., one at a time) which was unusual but good in that everyone tried everything that was ordered.  All of the food was authentic; the younger members of our group were a little surprised (happily) with some of the orders, because they looked and tasted different than some of the other Chinese restaurants they\u2019ve frequented.  The decor was decidedly old school Chinese traditional. And most of the otter diners appeared to be families and friends of Asian descent. Parking is street parking. Takeout containers are styrofoam - not the more traditional cardboard boxes I expected.",

        "caption": "Eating in China is a highly important feature in Chinese culture.  After all, Chinese people love to eat and view food as the common bond for  socializing whether over home cooked meal, street food snack or at restaurants.  Also, the typical loud talking, laughing and crowd size in restaurants indicates how good and tasty the restaurant's dishes are.  That being said, we were excited to kick off our Independence Day at this New and Hot Chinese restaurant with 5 other friends.  Yong's Kitchen is located on Maunakea Street near the cross street of North Pauahi or for local directions, it's directly across from the Vietnamese restaurant, Pho Que Huong and Lam's Kitchen.  Yes, it's the former Sunflower Caf\u00e9 and its interior is vaguely familiar as this new restaurant still uses the same Chinese wood dining furniture but has repainted the walls and added some Good Fortune decorations.  I had seen and read some other Yelp reviews for Yong's Kitchen so my taste buds were tantalized when we received this luncheon invitation and was told that fellow Elite, Paul C, had pre-ordered 2 dishes (Taro Duck and Chinese Bar-B-Que or Charsiu Pork Ribs).  The two dishes are considered Signature Dishes from this Chef who was formerly with our go-to restaurant, Moon Garden.  Knowing that 2 entr\u00e9es had been pre-ordered, we perused the menu to supplement our meal.  Chinese people like to order foods that incorporate hot and cold dishes or different cooking methods and different proteins and vegetables dependent upon availability.  FOOD: -Poached chicken with ginger & scallion sauce aka Cold Ginger Chicken:  the chicken was tender and its meat was smooth which indicates the proper poaching and broth temperature.   Half chicken:  $13.95  -Stir-fried  -Beef chow funn:  this is one of the dishes that I judge a Chinese restaurant by.   I look for the slightly crisped yet tender chewy texture of the dry fried rice noodle and the strands should not be broken or shredded.  There should be a slight smoky flavor from the well-seasoned wok and flame (wok hei).  This dish isn't nor should it be over seasoned or over salted.  The balanced use of ginger, scallions and soy sauce was just right.  $10.95  -Salt and pepper pork chops:  one of our favorite dishes...the pork chop was tender, had a light deep fried breading.  There was a nice saut\u00e9 of green onions, garlic, jalape\u00f1os and salt and pepper used to garnish the pork chop.  $11.95  -Taro duck:  if you like those taro puffs served at dim sum, you'd probably like this dish.  The taro topping was crisp fried like the taro puff with a dense mashed potato-like consistency.  Slight flavor of 5-spice powder or more predominately star anise.  It's not off-putting but, I am sensitive to licorice or anise flavors so I picked up on that spice.  Supporting the taro was a whole boneless duck that was seasoned and cooked through to a somewhat crispy texture.  It was delicious but I felt it was too rich and heavy.  You can only eat one piece.  This item is available only through ADVANCE ORDER.   $39.95  -Honey Bar-B-Que spare ribs or Charsiu ribs:   Its flavors and tenderness were stunning but the turnoff was the sharp bone shards found when biting into these unctuous ribs.  The pork was almost falling off the bones with each bite.  The flavor and tenderness was very reminiscent of Moon Garden. ADVANCE ORDER is recommended.  $24.00  Service was good for a Chinese restaurant.. our teapots and our water glasses were consistently refilled.  So, why only 4 stars?  Although we were the first group to arrive and stayed for over 2 hours, their air conditioning wasn't working.  As more people came in to dine, the latent heat started to build and several of us women started to fell like we were experiencing hot flashes even though we've passed that age range.  Tsk!  PARKING: We parked at the Smith & Beretania Municipal Parking Lot but you can also choose from other nearby municipal parking lots available or metered street parking stalls.",

Excellent contrast between the crisp outer covering, almost fluffy taro, and tender duck. Honey spareribs were tender and Yong's does not skimp on the honey sauce. Rounded out with seafood e-mein, fried pork chops, and spicy eggplant. Pork was tender and, for those who like jalapenos, there was lots of pepper to go with each bite. E-mein is  a little more plain but a good contrast to the other flavors. Great overall!",
