This is what happened today:  called in an order at 8:57 which they said would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes. At 9:20 I went in, 22 minutes later giving them more than enough time, and the following is what happened:  A female worker behind the counter with wavy hair sorta tallish was buzzing around yet didnt say a word. After she pd a truck driver, she asked without looking at me what Id like. I told her of my order so she looked at the orders on the counter, didnt say a word, went to the counter against the wall & was doing something else. I got her attention she turned & snapped her eyes wide open bopped her head and said NOTHING impying \"WHAT?!\". I said \"Sooo?\"  I mean right off the bat you could see she had an ATTITUDE by not speaking, then to NOT give me a status of my order THEN her whipping around to look at me & still not speaking.  She very hastily said if the order isn't up here then its not ready. A gentleman came from the back & said my order was next.  Then he came back to say my order was sent up already BUT it wasn't there. Its only my opinion but I think MISS THING probably gave it to the delivery dude.  In a nut she'll incompetent & RUDE!!!!  Well, I feel better for having vented, but I'm still hungry.  I'll now go to New Pkwy on 15 & 75. Have a nice day",

The owner claimed they had been ringing my bell for twenty minutes and called my phone (which is broken) but I had been here all morning and never heard the bell, which is not broken. When I asked for my money back, the owner refused stating that I'm making false orders and causing him to lose money. I raised my voice asking him what was wrong with him and told him I'd never had such terrible customer service in my entire life. He then told me they would block any future orders I made to their restaurant and I would not be allowed to dine there in the future. This is very distressing to me as someone who worked in the restaurant business and was proud of the customer service I always gave to others. He made no apologies at all and seemed determined to make the entire incident my fault. Thankfully GrubHub refunded my money and will be contacting the restaurant and helping me file a formal complaint. This is a disgraceful way to treat customers.",
