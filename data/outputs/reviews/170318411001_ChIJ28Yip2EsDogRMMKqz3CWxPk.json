        "caption": "Sing's Noodles offered the best service I have had. They have a variety of sauces for Hot Pot that you can choose for free, and their items were so fresh and delicious. Their menu is very straightforward, either pay full price of about $23 per person for everything on the menu you would like to order, or you pay $17 for 8 items per person. We chose $17 and it filled you up with deliciousness and great aroma from their broth.  I went to Mandarin Kitchen Hot Pot in front of Chinatown today and I regretted. They treated us poorly: the waitress was arrogant, their menu was so misleading that resulted us to end up paying $180 instead of just $80 for 4 people. They also required tipping with 3 options: 15%, 20% and 25%. I bit the bullet and paid for it but now I can't go to sleep remembering how terribly they treated us, so I write a review for this wonderful Sing's Noodles' experience we had there.",
