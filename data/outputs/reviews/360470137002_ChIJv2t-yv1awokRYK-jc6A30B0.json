        "caption": "First time dining since Pandemic closures.  The place was empty with choice of indoor or outdoor. Chose indoor since it was the first chilly day and saw the Brunch Menu. Clean and friendly service and felt safe with personnel wearing masks and gloves and not getting  too close to me.  In short, good food and service though they need to work on the burger temps... Asked for Medium Rare but got well done and could be slightly seasoned. Was rather big and dense and plain despite the Avocados, lettuce and tomatoes and Gruyere Cheese.  Also, ordered some Oysters and Clams from the Raw Bar which were great, accompanied by horse radish, shallots and wine, cocktail sauce. That day the Oysters were  from NY, NJ, Canada and Clams. Delicious and fresh!  From the main Brunch Menu got their Fish & Chips besides the burger.  Was surprised to see that it was grilled Branzino on top of fries... but that is my fault for not completely reading the description ( my dining partnersaid it was described as so). However, I was not disappointed! It was perfectly seasoned and cooked with a great sauce on top and some mayo or aioli dabs on the side. Fries on both dishes were good, though could be fried a bit longer for crispness as well as the wait time between appetizers and main could be faster as I and one other were the only diners. Hibiscus Red Sangrea, was sweet and tasty. Iced coffee was good and strong.  Over all, prices were a little high, seeing one menu item of Crab Fried Rice for $30!!! No fried rice dish should ever be $30. BUT, during these times I can be sympathetic (except for that fried rice price) and it was a welcome treat for venturing out in a long time.  Menu is promising with great variety of choices from Bone Marrow appetizers, meat and cheese boards to Crudos and Raw Bar and Steaks. Drink menu is nice and  should please all if in a group or relaxing meal for one or two. Server and personnel were great and friendly and they were just putting up heat lamps for outdoor dining.  I'll be sure to come back, but if you order the burger, be firm on how you want it, nothing special and would encourage trying the many  other choices instead...  Wish this place much success.",
