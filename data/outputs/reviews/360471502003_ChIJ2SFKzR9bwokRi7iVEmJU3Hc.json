Prior to covid we always sat down for lunch special because it is so worth it. If you want spicy, this is the place with the great kick and flavor. Pad see ew is one of my other favorite ones. Overall, great ambiance with amazing flavors.",

The snapper was also a bit dry and overcooked. Food wasn\u2019t bad but was just average to me. This seems like one of those hit or miss places and I have a feeling that they rush a lot of their meals or serve old items. On the plus side, it was delivered quickly and efficiently.

I've ordered delivery from them multiple times and have been very satisfied with the food and service.  10/2014 Update (3 years later): Dice has been very hit or miss the last dozen times I have ordered. Quality and consistency have both taken a turn for the worse. The good tastes burnt half the time.",
