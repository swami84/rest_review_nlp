Both were INCREDIBLY delicious!!!! As someone who works in restaurant management,  I was blown out of the water. From start to finish was impeccable. I also want to call out the manager Danny (maybe Dan...). He stopped by on a table touch and we got into a full length conversation about the restaurant. He is incredibly knowledgeable and kind hearted. Such an asset to this restaurant! Very happy with my experience and I plan for us to come back as often as possible! 10/10!",

More vegan friendly than similar places, they have lots of vegetarian/vegan possibilities, as they have meat/fish/tofu add-on's to already substantial dishes. Menu: Food is generally healthy, and its possible to eating a filling meal with fewer carbs and more protein. Entrees are well thought out with a nice depth of flavor, and interesting  combinations of ingredients. Mother Earth and the Vegan Ramen bowl are good examples. Drink: On the expensive side, but not more so than other places. Prosecco is $8 for a small pour, this could be more competitively priced. Ambiance: Cute 60's like decor, with a fresh cafeteria feel. Cost: Average-high for a fast food place - we paid $50 for 3 people (including one drink each). Would recommend!",

        "caption": "Innovative healthy dishes bursting with flavor and charred to perfection. A vegan and gluten-free paradise with bountiful bowls/salad/wraps and good for meat-lovers with salmon, chicken, grass-fed steak - truly a crowd-pleaser.  Farm to table concept - everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients, similar to True Foods Kitchen and notch above Urban Plates and Modern Market Eatery.  My hubby and I gleefully enjoyed watching our dishes get all fired up in the open oven! To my surprise, the round pizza style-oven isn't used to bake pizza, but rather to cook veggies and meats.  The Forbidden Rice (5/5) - Hits the spot! The veggie medley of broccoli, bok choy, snap peas, onions, purple and yellow carrots with fancy black pearl and red japonica rice coated in spicy hoisin sauce, topped with crunchy sesame seeds, and charred tofu was a home-run! All the ingredients blended well together with a nice smoky flavor from the fire roasted veggies. The seasoned tofu is worth paying the extra $4, great flavor! Generous portion size and satisfying - clean happy plate.  The Salmon with Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes plate (5/5) - My hubby relished the pan-seared juicy salmon, creamy potatoes, and tender broccoli. Clean plate - not a crumb was spared.  Avocado Toast (5/5) - The hearty multigrain bread with a touch of honey, avocado spread, soft egg, and topped with mild shredded cheddar cheese was a delight! It was an epic battle for the last piece.  Apple Spice Kombucha (5/5) - Sour apple, sweet and tangy with a tart finish. If you love sourpatch or Granny Smith apple, go for it!  Chocolate Chip Cookie (2/5) - I wasn't a fan of the oily brittle cookie. While I love moist cookies with a crispy outer layer, the gluten-free cookie missed the mark. The coconut shavings didn't quite work well.  Service was the best part! (5/5) - Our meal took about 15 - 20 min to make, not a long wait time at all. The server, David, profusely apologized with a warm smile and treated us with an extra round of the Apple Spice Kombucha. Perfect ending to a delicious meal!  Looking forward to another culinary adventure and making our way through the menu!",

It's from the West Coast, looks beautiful, and every millennial wants to get selfies with its catchy phrases brightly painted on its walls. Despite it making me feel like I am not cool enough, I left a big fan. Here's why:  1) Food: It's excellent. They source local ingredients (at least they make you feel like they do) and cook healthier food in an open kitchen. They sell salads, wraps, and plates (where you can pick two sides with sliced chicken or beef). I ordered a plate of gluten-free mac and cheese and brussel sprouts. Both were among the best I've had in the city. The chicken breast I got with it was perfectly, lightly seasoned. I also got a gluten-free soft chocolate chip cookie and a freshly made pomegranate ginger lemonade (they give you a cup so it's free refills). My bill came to just under $23 (yep, expensive).  2) Vibes: The staff definitely came across friendly, but with a little \"I am cooler than you\" vibes. Despite that, they were nice, efficient, and seemed proud to work there.  3) Space: It's simple yet colorful. There's a large open space with tables in the middle and tables off to the side as well. The light comes in easily making it simple to snap a photo, post it to Snapchat/Instagram, and tag Flower Child.  I am impressed. Flower Child has somehow made eating healthier cool again. Welcome to Washington, D.C., Flower Child!",

For $10, I got a pile of coarsely cut greens (part of the core of the savoy cabbage included), with a few slices of tomatoes, a slice of mandarin and avocado.  Nothing else.  The portion came out considerable smaller than salads served for dine-in guests.  For any added protein is an additional charge of $5(!), no bread available at all.  What's the hype about!   only the fact they serve wine and beer! Sweetgreen is so much better in all respects.!",
