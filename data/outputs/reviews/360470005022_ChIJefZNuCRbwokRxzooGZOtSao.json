Yet the second order was not like the first. Nor did they even look or taste the same. I can't believe I spent over $40.00 for this horrible old food.  That went straight in the garbage. The food did not look good or taste good. My only regret is NOT taking a photos of the food.  They have lost me as a customer.  Now I understand why  Chinese Restaurants  are going out of business.",

More recently I've noticed that the quality of the food on the lunch menu has changed . I received food that was Luke warm and sometimes the rice side was completely cold. The first incident that occurred was a bit less offensive than the second. I decided to dine in one day with a friend, we paid for our food and we forgot to leave a tip because we were rushing to a movie. The lady at the front door stopped us before we left and demanded that we explain why we didn't leave a tip. She pushed the issue and insisted that we pay our waiter their tip, which we would have done if we had not forgot and we did but we left the restaurant feeling quite uncomfortable. The next incident was more of a silent offense when I visited the restaurant with a male friend of mine from Spain. We didn't feel welcome in the restaurant and we received rude stares from the staff , who took the liberty of bringing our check way before we asked for it. While eating we felt extremely uncomfortable and my lunch companion vowed never to return to this restaurant again because we felt like we were on display. The last straw occurred a few months later when  I  had a problem with a young girl who worked behind the register. I ordered food from the lunch menu and I was told that there was a minimum of ten dollars for cards . I left and returned after getting money from the bank and got back on line . The lady in front of me was picking up food also . Her food , like mine cost less than $10.00. However she being older than me , as well as a white woman while I'm am not, was allowed to use her card without any difficulties, and was treated respectfully . So I decided I would not spend my money at a restaurant that does not treat their customers equally. This whole situation has left a bad taste in my mouth about the restaurant . I have not returned to this restaurant  since.",

The people are great. Attentive and were nice to a \"baby\". They gave extra napkins and said, \"you have baby\". Haha The atmosphere is nice. The prices are a tad more than usual dinky Chinese food stores. There's a reason. It's better than dinky stores. Love the tea pot. Good to drink warm things after a meal.  No one takes a shot of the restroom. I guess I might be a first LOL not the best place I've been to but it's also not the worst.  Edit: Been here few times after review. It's a cozy place. We'll probably keep coming. No issues the 4 times we've been here.",

The food from the regular and less expensive Chinese restaurants taste way better, plus the servers don't ask for tip, like my experience at this restaurant shown. After I wrote the tip amount the server came back to me and asked for more because it wasn't within the required 15% that is supposedly included. Then they throw a fit about me not tipping them. I've worked in the service industry and I have never asked for tip from anyone. You don't harass someone and then throw temper tantrums about not receiving the \"appropriate\" 15% gratuituty. Closing, I only gave $2 because the service wasn't that great to begin with.",

My mother and i decided to have a quick evening meal there this summer while vacationing in NY,after receiving our meal (which was culinary mediocracy  at  best) if i must say so,we asked for the waiter to bring our check. Upon the waiter returning with our check we left a payment for what was owed and began to leave as we didn't find it necessary to leave a tip for the waiters average service,,which consisted of him just simply placing an order and bringing us our order with not one touch of customer personalization or friendliness. As we began to leave he followed us to the door asking\" where his tip was\",,my mother explained that we were not gonna be able to tip today,he than stormed away and grabbed his manager who then came out and decided to scold and chastise us in front of a room filled with customers  on the policy of tip-giving and how his employess dont make much. After going on for what seemed to be like10 minutes i explained what \"gratuity\" was and how it is  optional and also how him scolding us in front of people about not leaving a tip was not only disrespectful but totally unprofessional,,,he then told us to shut up and get out and while we were speaking he had a young lady behind the counter turn up the music volume on full blast to drown us out all while others were still dining. Ive never had such a discusting experience in my life,do yourself a favor and skip this joint and spend your money with an establishment that carries themselves with a little more dignity and pride",
