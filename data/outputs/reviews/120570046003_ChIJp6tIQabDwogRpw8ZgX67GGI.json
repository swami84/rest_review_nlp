Of the last 10 visits I would say 6-7 you regret even stopping it took so long.  The staff is always friendly/great but something is off inside. (short staffed, mngt etc). Around New years one visit their kitchen was closed (thats fine) gave them another try the next day and they have one employee on that shift buried in orders. Multiple times I have waited through the drive thru lane that would usually take 5-6 minutes that took 15-20 minutes or longer. Been to Dunkins 100's of times and cant remember waiting over 5-10 minutes during the busiest times at any location. This location takes 5 minutes just to greet at the ordering intercom. Today was horrid, a driver behind me was yelling  out their window to get out of the way because the intercom attendant was taking forever. Got in the lane around 642am-out of the lane at 658am (one car in front of me, maybe one already at the window) all to be asked to park and wait for 2 wake up wraps.  3-5 minutes go by had to run in and get them myself, line was 4-5 people all who looked just as frustrated, again employees were super friendly so I dont think that's the issue at this location. 20 minutes for a med coffee and 2 wake up wraps is an issue. Hopefully they make some changes to become more timely. America runs on Dunkin or atleast walks at this location",

Then when he finally got to me he just was looking at me (i guess that was my greeting) Soo i started to place my order. I asked him what flavor lattes did he have and he started  naming them really fast i had to cut him off just to tell him which one i wanted. So he started to make it, when he got back with it i asked him was i able to mix my munchkins and he was like,\"Um yea, but its 6:02 (it was actually 5:57)...but he goes on to say, im not supposed to be here now and my ride is waiting on me\", i kindly asked was there anyone else there with him he said no like he was frustrated with me. So i proceed with my mix of munchkins. I wanted something else but with his attitude i just said thats it and left i was really pissed this was by far the WORST experience I've EVER HAD ANYWHERE.
