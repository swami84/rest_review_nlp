It wasn't hot when it arrived, which made it easy to eat like a traditional pizza but perhaps dining in is best. I appreciate they included plates, silverware, parmesian cheese and red hot pepper flakes but just didn't love the pizza. Got a medium Malnati Chicago Classic... comes with plenty of sausage on top, and cheese. Crust was a little hard and saltiness cracker like. Two people will be full with a medium, had extra for the morning.",

The staff at the top floor all recommended we head downstairs and preorder our pizza, so we wouldn't have to wait so long for our pizza to come out. We did that, and it felt like in no time we were sitting down and ready to eat. We got appetizers and a drink and within a few minutes after that we got our pizza. The pizza was so good, super cheesy and the crust was delicious. The sauce was good and was perfectly balanced with the cheese. I highly recommend coming here for a traditional chicago deep dish.",

We waited 1 and a half hours to get seated, no problem, it was busy and understandable. Once seated, someone came and taped our pre-order slip on the stand on our table. Then absolutely no one came for 10 minutes...WE had to flag someone down to ask for a bar menu and for waters. We then ordered a can of white claw and no one came with the waters or drink for another 20 minutes. That is 30 minutes of waiting, after 1.5 hours, with a \u201cpre-order\u201d that was supposed to make the food come out faster. We were so upset and flagged down the waitress we originally had. As I was explaining what happened, she said \u201cwell your pizza is here already and I\u2019ll see about the drink\u201d. It felt dismissive and she did not address the service so far. The pizza was LUKEWARM and the drink (a can, not cocktail)came out after another 5 minutes. The cheese was no longer melted and the \u201cbutter crust\u201d got hard and tough so fast. I believe that Lou\u2019s has good pizza, and other locations may be better but we had an absolutely horrid experience and introduction to the restaurant. Super sad.",

We were told it was about a 30 minute wait, not even close it was exactly 60 minutes.  They told use we could order our pizza and appetizer while we were waiting. The hostess stand said the kitchen would time everything if we ordered both ahead. My husband went to order ahead and was only able to order the pizza, no appetizers. Luckily when he was ordering ahead he noticed my phone number had been put in wrong. Had the hostess verified the phone number I could have corrected the 2 turned around numbers right away (dyslexia?).  When we were seated we ordered drinks and some cheesy bread. The pizza came out about 2 minutes after the cheesy bread. My glass of wine came out about 5 minutes after the pizza. My husband and daughter got the sausage pizza they said was good and the crust was cooked. I got the vegetable pizza and the crust was cooked, but mushy. After we ate we were rushed out right away so they could have the table. We wanted some desert, so we got a single tiramisu to go.  They really should consider reservation only or seating times and only a small area for walk-ins. Then give the walk-ins an accurate wait time. I was really disappointed, can\u2019t believe it\u2019s one of my best friends favorite restaurants.",

We pre-ordered the pizza as requested so we were prepared for the wait but we were hoping for at least hot food. At that point, we were hungry and wanted to eat so just dealt with it. Also the service was extremely slow- getting the check and having it picked up. Not upset the wait was long, we knew that going in. Disappointed in the food and service.",
