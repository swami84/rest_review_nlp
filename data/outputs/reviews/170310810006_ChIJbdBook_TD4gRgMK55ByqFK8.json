        "caption": "Today, my wife, two sons (4 and 2), and I went for lunch to get the dollar subs deal. After waiting in line we tried to buy subs, one for each of us, but they would not allow us to buy our children a dollar sub. They said, \"only one sub per person.\" I simply and kindly told them that our two boys were indeed people. Yet, they only responded with, \"I am sorry, only one sub per person.\" I looked at them strangely and said \"please let me at least buy one sub for them to split so they can also eat.\" Just to get rid of me, they reluctantly allowed me to buy them 1 sub and only put a tiny bit of turkey on it. Very bad customer service. If there was an age limit that would have been simple for them to say, but instead they decided that children do not count as a person who eats food. Seems very strange to me.",

Wrong sandwiches/toppings both instances, second time they also forgot the chips (and it took 45 minutes for delivery). I order from here when I work from home and don't have time for lunch, I live in a high rise 2 blocks away.  I ordered two sandwiches from there around 4PM last Wed and while it came fast one of the sandwiches was completely wrong (loaded Vito instead of a plain Turkey Tom). Fine, it can be overlooked.  Then I ordered from here around 8PM last Sun, 2 sandwiches and 2 bags of chips. The delivery guys arrives 45 minutes later, which is not why I order Jimmy John's in the first place. Immediately I notice they forgot the chips, and the delivery guy mentions they must have been forgotten during bagging because they're \"slammed\", and says he'll be back in 20 with them. Call back to see if there is any way they can send them faster or refund the chips due to the error and time, manager says she's sorry for the mistake it happened because they're \"really busy\" but can't refund them and will instead send two extra bags when they come back. Fine.  Already a bit perturbed, I open my sandwich and it is missing the peppers and sauce I added (which were correctly captured on the receipt for the order). At this point I'm pretty unhappy so I call back to speak to the manager. Turns out she's \"new\" and once again mentions they're \"super busy\" (3rd time) and will send another sandwich properly. By the time I get that and the chips it's an hour and a half from when I originally placed the order.  At the end of the day I would have rather just had them get it right the first time. If it's taking 45 minutes to get deliveries out then they might as well have the right orders in them. This one store has tainted a rather pleasant experience with Jimmy John's across multiple cities and countless locations. Really hope something is done about it.",
