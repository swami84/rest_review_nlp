I had contacted this establishment, along with others, asking if it would be possible for them to keep their doors open longer so that people could come eat after the concert. The gentleman running it not only responded really quickly, but was awesome enough to stay open so we would be able to eat! He, and the two ladies that worked, were very nice with smiles all around! The food was delicious! I had the pork belly and spicy wings, and we also had bulgolgi, brisket, and soup around the table. Everything was good! Very decent priced as well! I will def be back next time I have some time in Chicago!",

I decided to come to this place because I watch a lot of Korean vloggers on YouTube so I've been wanting to try a Korean restaurant that wasn't a cook it your self KBBQ. We were going to a Blackhawks game and it was pretty close  We ordered the green onion pancake which was too soft and kind of bland.. I prefer a more crispy pancake but it came with a spice to dip in for more flavor. We also ordered their jumbo wings that are not jumbo anymore (half spicy half savory) an order of 8 wings for $10.. they were pretty small. We also ordered the SoJu Ribs and Grilled Pork Belly. It came with rice and I got kimchi with it that was okay. The Pork needs more flavor but they have us a spice to dip/pour on it. We also got an order of Army Soup. It was spicy and pretty good. We got it with ramen rice cakes and pork belly. I've been to Korea and I remember their meat being so full of flavors which is why I'm giving this a 3 star review. I'd give them 3.5 if I could but it's not an option.  The service was great though! Our waiter was so nice and very helpful.",

I did miss the myriad of side dishes that traditional kbbq offered. However, it actually did save some time on service and really liked the fact that I could just order a single serving of kbbq instead of being forced to order 2 portion minimums. In terms of the food, every meat is seasoned well and cooked for you. I\u2019ve REALLY enjoyed the kalbi (very unique cooking method and presentation) and ribeye the most and pork belly had various spices that kept things interesting. I think the prices are reasonable for the portions considering what other places are charging these days... I\u2019m excited to see what else they\u2019ll add to the menu in the future!",

I love the army soup - one of the best I've ever had. Meat will speak for itself in quality and the seasoning is spot-on. The space is small but the service is extremely friendly and tried to accommodate everyone.",

Seems the staff was grossly unprepared for the influx of customers coming between matches. We waited ONE FULL HOUR  and our food still had not arrived. Also noticing that they were serving food out of sequence of the orders placed. We finally gave up and asked for a refund. They did not seem to have a system at all for basic tracking of which table ordered what. Solution can be as simple as putting order numbers, giving these to each table, and then preparing and serving in that sequence. It\u2019s not rocket science!! Also may help to staff up when there are events at the United Center. People come here expecting a \u201cquick casual\u201d experience. We were not expecting Fast Food. But it quickly turned into Very Slow Food, and then ultimately \u2014 No Food!!  Worst. Restaurant. Experience. Ever.",

The flavorful meat comes balanced with a side of rice and your choice of veggies. I went with the kimchi and sliced cucumbers, which added some nice crunch to the meal.  I saw that they also do delivery via Grubhub, Uber Eats, Caviar etc. so I'd recommend that if you can't make it to the restaurant. Looking forward to coming here again with friends to try out some of the other dishes!",
