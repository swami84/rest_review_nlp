I wanted to have crab meat soup dumplings, but they didn't have it when I ordered, so instead I had pork, mushrooms and shrimp soup dumplings. The skin of the dumplings are bit thicker side, but amount of soup inside of dumplings are great, and very nice. Holding that amount of soup, it make sense that the skin of dumplings is thicker side.  There is nice morning special if you are into Chinese congee for 3 bucks.  I only ate dumplings so can't talk about the taste of congee, but I was happy about this authentic soup dumplings.  Additional note is that they will take $1deposit for a bamboo tray, when you bring it back after you are,  they will give you back the deposit.",
