I then asked her something about the vegetarian plant based options, and again she gave me a nasty attitude.

If you love Thai food like us and want authentic Thai you have to come to Skyice. From the appetizer to dessert is delicious. I had a drink recommended by the owner... It was an hibiscus ( in the Caribbean we call it sorrel) lemonade ....it was refreshing and delicious. You have to visit, I promise u,  you will be back for more.

The whole fried snapper with mango salad is my go to order, but it\u2019s always tough to choose over the perfect Kao Soi and the rest of the authentic Thai food dishes on the menu. The Thai beef jerky is ridiculously good too (they use sirloin to make it, so tender). The ice cream that SkyIce is famous for is available in a wide variety of flavors, situated in an old fashioned ice cream parlor in the back of the restaurant. Knock out Thai flavors...durian, Thai coffee, black sesame seaweed and my other faves, white miso almond, banana nutella and Belgian chocolate brownie. I\u2019ve been to several cities in Thailand and SkyIce 9th St has a staff that is just as friendly and attentive as any place in Bangkok or Chaing Mai. Highly recommend!",

Also had the roasted coconut ice cream which was also delicious.  Since then, I've gone religiously and ate something different every time. Every dish and dessert has been great. The food is on par with some of the best Thai places I've been to in New York (e.g. UpThai), and I love that they have some of the more authentic Thai dishes, not just pad thai, pad see ew, and the regular curries.  Overall, I can't recommend it enough, and definitely the best Asian restaurant in southern Park Slope, which, as someone who loves all kinds of Asian food, is more than welcome.",
