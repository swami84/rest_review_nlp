The two times that stick out for me, because I always go in thinking it will be better this time, they completely skipped my order & I ended up waiting over 25 mins for a bagel with cream cheese.  The next time, after waiting 22 minutes, they did not put cheese on the breakfast sandwich.  I then get told that they cannot open the sandwich, which they made, to put the cheese on!  I would have to wait for a new one to be made (no thanks) or they can give me the cheese and I can put it on myself - I think you can guess the option I went for.

It is so horribly inefficient, a simple bagel sandwich consistently takes 20 minutes to get, while Corey's NYC bagel down the street can do it in 3 minutes.  They have five people working during lunch, but one is on break, the other is idling by the register, and another is sitting at a table flicking at his phone, leaving two people to prep food during their busiest times.  The staff is very self aware that they are slow, and see to embrace they fact they are slow.   For my own mental health, I had to stop going here.  Seeing how a basic operation of making mediocre bagel sandwiches is so thoroughly slow and mismanaged drives me nuts.  Don't get sucked in!",

The food was okay, chicken tastes like freezer burn, but the bagels are soft and delicious! They serve Caribou coffee as well, nice drink selections. The employees hate their jobs and it's very noticeable by how \"moody\" they are. We sat by the ordering counter and we could hear them arguing with each other the whole time we were there. Other than that, great place to get bagels! I would probably do delivery or pickup next time to avoid the wait and crabby employees.",

I can\u2019t even comprehend it honestly. They\u2019re beyond miserable and negative and terribly mean 24/7. They have messed up my order and told me that it\u2019s my fault, they throw my bag of food towards me on the counter while keeping their back to me, not looking at me, not thanking me or saying a word. I feel so disrespected being treated/talked to that way. I could give many stories that would make your jaw drop to the floor but it would make this post way too long. The only reason I come back here is because it\u2019s the only Einstein bagel bros close to my house and I like the bagels but I honestly think I\u2019m done. I feel uncomfortable coming here. One time the girl was so disrespectful to me that I asked her if there was a problem. To what I thought was going to be a good thing, the manager came over. I KID YOU NOT the manager started treating me worse than the employee, saying that it was my fault my order was messed up. It\u2019s disgusting. I worry about what they might do to my food if you know what I mean. My recommendation to the company is to pay attention to how your employees are doing business at this location and do a better job of hiring a staff that doesn\u2019t make customers feel uncomfortable and disrespected to the point where they can\u2019t eat here anymore.",

We ordered four bagels with spreads which shouldn\u2019t be too complicated but one bagel had the cheapest serving of cream cheese I\u2019ve ever seen (see photo) and my brother ended up with an Asiago bagel with jalape\u00f1o cream cheese instead of a cinnamon raisin bagel with butter...

        "caption": "I have always loved Einstein Brothers! They aren't very popular where I live now, so when I saw one in Chicago, I was so excited to bring some bagels home. However, my experience there was probably the worst I've ever experienced at ANY establishment, ever, not just Einstein's. This is gonna be a long review... I walked in with my friend, and went up to the \"Order Here\" sign, next to the bagel display. There were three or four workers behind the counter with their backs turned, making sandwiches and such. That was fine, since I needed time to decide anyway. But after about three minutes of waiting, no one had said a word to me, my friend, or the other customer in line. Finally, one of the ladies told us \"You order over there\" and pointed to the register. I thought \"...ok, well the sign says order here, and this is where the bagels are, but whatever.\" So I go down to the register, tell her I want half a dozen, and pay. The register girl tells another girl to go get my bagels. I ask if I'm allowed to choose, and she says yes. So I go back to the Order Here area. The girl chosen to help me said that she was new, but based what happens next, I find it hard to believe she received any training at all. So, she awkwardly stands behind the bagel display, not saying anything and looking around. So, I start by saying \"Hi, I'll have two chocolate chip bagels, a blueberry, a garlic-...\" But I stop because she doesn't appear to be listening, nor is she making any moves to grab a bagel. She says, \"Blueberry, what?\" At this point I'm really annoyed and tired of being patient with this whole situation, so I decide to do this bagel by bagel. \"Two chocolate chip bagels\" She looks around the display, searching. Now, I find it hard to believe that there are no signs on the other side of the display indicating the types of bagels in each basket. If there were such signs, she had no idea, because she had to desperately search for each one as I called it out. I had to point out each bagel's location in the display. We continue, and the process takes at least a full minute. So then she sets the bagel box down on the counter and tries to close the top of the box. She clearly has no idea how to close the box correctly. So I tell her I can do it and take my bagel box. Now, one of the reasons I love Einstein's bagels is the chocolate chip bagels. I noticed when she grabbed those two, that she picked one from the Cranberrry side of the basket. I wasn't about to be cheated out of my glorious CC bagels, so I check. Lo and behold, one cranberry and one chocolate chip. So I go back to the counter and explain the situation, and a different girl gives me a chocolate chip bagel. I also noticed when I got home that she gave me a pretzel instead of a potato bagel. Ugh. Thus ends my terrible experience at this Einstein Bros location. I am amazed that they are able to function with such incompetence. Seriously, this location needs to hire higher quality staff, and ensure that they're trained before putting them on the Sunday mid-morning shift. This was an embarressment.",

        "caption": "I've tried to eat at this place twice but the service is sooooo slow. The first attempt was two months ago, there were five people ahead of me in line. After waiting ten minutes on only moving up two spots in line I walked out the door.  Today I tried to go back. I walked in about 15 minutes before they closed. There was one other customer and four employees that I could see. Just like the time before, I was not greeted whatsoever. I waited in the order line for a couple minutes and then an employee, who appeared to be a manager that was sitting in the corner working on some paperwork yelled across the seating area to another employee  that they were closing in ten minutes. I thought she was talking to me, but she clarified that she wasn't and went back to her paperwork in the corner.  There were two employees behind the counter but neither acknowledge my presence. They appeared to be cleaning and getting ready to leave. After waiting about five more minutes and not having an employee try to take my order, I walked out and went a couple blocks down the street to NYC Bagel Deli. I'm embarrassed for Einstein that they could care so little about the customer experience. Obviously I wont be going back, and I recommend everyone else do the same.",
