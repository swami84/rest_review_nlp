They have sushi with apples, a pickle and radish roll, a ham roll, a cheese stick roll...It goes on and on. Never even heard of some of their combinations!  All of their stuff is good, especially if you are staying in on the weekend and do not feel like cooking. They stuff is affordable too. They offer standard Chinese & sushi takeout with a twist. They have pizza roles, not every Chinese place has it. Do not ask, I just love them.  I realize I can not eat Chinese food every day and of course care for my health so they are definitely my YOLO meal for the week So happy to find a \"Chinese\" place that serves decent food, despite it being what it is-Chinese takeout but at a much higher level compared to all these stupid rundown places in Bed Stuy where the Chinese stores look dirty with bullet proof glass.",
