I remember when they were on the corner attached to House of Yes and getting ready to move to their current location. When they finally did it was such a treat! The menu expanded to better suit indoor dining while maintaining the flavors I had come to love.  At the beginning of the pandemic we would go once a week for take-out to support and get our fix of good food. My favorite is the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich. The pickled cauliflower and grilled onions are a perfect marriage of flavors.  My partner loves the Shakshuka. Harissa, eggs, tahini, and grilled pita: what's not to love? Served hot with a bit of spice. If he doesn't get this he really enjoys the Lamb Burger for a meal on the go. It's hearty and still with a kick of harissa.  If you do go, work your way through the menu to find your favorite. I've had everything here and was not disappointed.  As a side note: the owners have been really diligent in maintaining the safety of their guests and staff during the pandemic. Masks, gloves, sanitizer, and distancing are all spot on. Cannot wait to be able to sit down in their beautiful space again, though doing take-out makes me really happy.",

We ordered the chicken shawarma plate and baba ghanoush and it was sooo delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and the ingredients are excellent quality, it was just like, if not better than homemade! Usually Shwarma feels like junk food but this one was very clean and tastes healthy. I also loved the compostable eco friendly packaging, very impressed with this place. My only complaint is I wish the portion size was slightly bigger just so I could enjoy more deliciousness. Do not hesitate to frequent this place if you love authentic middle eastern food!",

It was definitely not fresh either. Tasted very stale. The soup was alright (just had a few sips). The hummus was good but it definitely didn't redeem the rest of the meal. I liked the pita chips despite them almost breaking my teeth. Oh and we both got diarrhea after eating this food. Don't be fooled by the nice pictures I took of the food.

We ordered hibiscus margaritas and fresh lemonade with vodka-so good!  The staff was very friendly and took time to answer questions.

Wasn't a huge fan of my shroom shawarma, each piece individually was great but something about all the elements together didn't work for me. Love the atmosphere, relaxed not too stuffy Moroccan atmosphere, and the other food I had was great so I'll definitely be going back.  The price point is just what the wyckoff strip needed, great casual spot with solid vibes to hang out and relax. Will be great when things warm up.",
