Pick up was super fast over the lunch hour, right at 15 minutes (I can walk there from our downtown Bloomington office) So much food for the price, and the quality is top notch! The beef with broccoli was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and the amount of sauce was just right. Comes with white rice, but you can sub for fried rice with a small fee. It came in the perfect sized container which is microwaveable so if you only want to eat half and save the other half for another lunch day, you're already good to go! The egg roll was the perfect complement and it came with all of the sauces: soy, sweet sour and spicy mustard. I understand now why everyone else in my office is obsessed and goes there regularly. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!",

The basic meals (around 5 to 6 dollars)are filling and large but you can basicly super size of with a soup, egg roll, wonton and crab rangoon for an extra 4 dollars. That means for about 10 bucks you get a giant amount of food. I grabbed the wonton soup to start which was full of delicious wontons. I subbed fried rice for the white which was an excellent choice. My beef and mushrooms was incredible. The shrimp and broccoli was even better. I highly suggest the food here as it's incredible. Now the location for eat in has a kind of downfall. I remember it differently back in the day fully decorated and exquisite. Now it's similar to a cafeteria with cheap tables and generic cafeteria chairs. A little decor on the walls but no major ambiance (hince the 4 stars). Grab this place for carry out or get it delivered. It is way better than the local China Star or Panda express and a much better value.",

Many are Sue's (co-owner, Kevin's wife) family's recipes that she brought with her from Taiwan. Since they're cooking everything to order, sometimes it may take them a bit longer to get your food to you. However, the slightly longer wait time is well worth it in my opinion. My favorite is the garlic chicken, which is definitely unique to the Golden Dragon. Other Chinese restaurants in town have garlic chicken, but I haven't found one that I like nearly as much as theirs.",

The service is always friendly and fast, the prices are reasonable, and the food just tastes better than other Chinese restaurants. Their egg rolls are especially amazing. It's my go-to Chinese place now.",
