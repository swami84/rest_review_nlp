Since we didn't our host escorted us to the back where it was more occupied. She lead us to a curtained both. Very nice touch for us. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We had red wine and chicken (salad and potato cut fries on the side). They also gave use a complimentary cup of potato soup which was good and spicy. We ordered a cheesecake slice and came with a raspberry and raspberry sauce. Very delicious. Pricey but it's Chicago and fine dining. I highly recommend this place and would love to go back.",

When you walk in the front of the space seems almost more like a coffee shop, as just the host stand and the bar are situated up there but there was no one sitting at the bar.  They then take you to the back dining room which has a quiet and secluded ambiance.  The menu is not huge but focuses on Latin inspired steak and seafood dishes.  There are a couple vegetarian dishes as well.  Prices are spot on and dishes were super flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Service was very attentive and friendly, and helpful with us newbies as we had questions navigating the menu.",

When we walked in we saw the awards for the \u201cmost romantic restaurant\u201d on yelp. We were confused at first because it seemed empty and like a standard restaurant. Then the owner took us back through the front of the restaurant and it was like we entered another world. The light was low and each table had a centerpiece of lights. It was beautifully decorated and we both were in shock and awe.  Our waiter brought us a sipping soup that was absolutely delicious - roasted poblano, potato, caramelized onion, cilantro and cream. I would\u2019ve ordered a large bowl for my meal! We got the New York Strip and Pork Chops. Both were amazing. Mine came with mashed potatoes (in the shape of a heart) and a delicious salad while the pork came with roasted vegetables and potatoes. The ambiance and the food was amazing and affordable. We\u2019ll definitely be back",

It's a small and unassuming restaurant front and when we entered, we were met with a huge group of people participating in the free wine tasting. We were led to the back of the restaurant which opened up into a beautiful and dimly lit room with curtains and cabanas and dining tables. They start you off with complimentary soup and we shared the crab cake appetizer which was delicious. I got the New York steak entree and my husband got the pork, both of which were delicious! We finished off with the coconut flan which was thick and creamy and amazing!! Our server Sebastian was excellent and prompt. He drew a rose with chocolate sauce and wrote happy birthday on our dessert plate. We met the owner and she was so sweet and nice. We loved our visit and we definitely will be back!",

Almost all the steaks had roasted garlic peppercorn...most dishes were served with avocado cream. The steaks were not very good...seemed like the cheapest cuts with a chewed up texture. Flat iron was cooked closer to MW than MR. I guess that's why entrees can be kept in the $20-range rather than $40-50. Waitress was fairly snarky. Wine guy was however terrifically knowledgeable and they had a well rounded and affordable wine list. And finally, if you gotta offer flashlights to read the menu, it stands to reason that your guests also can't really see what they're eating. Deliberate?",

We ordered the shrimp appetizer based on yelp recommendations and it was really good. Come and try this place. We are big foodies and will definitely be back",

We were greeted by the owners at the door. The interior is clean and intimate with a surprisingly expansive and well appointed back room.  The steak was nearly perfectly cooked. Vegetables were also nearly perfectly grilled. They brought a potato soup sample that was delicious with a bit of spice. Don't miss out on the poblano mashed potatoes - they were a delicious side dish.  We were very impressed with the entire experience and will be back soon!",
