        "caption": "Wife and I came here around noon today (Tuesday Feb. 16 in the eternal year of our Covid  2021). Parking was easy as they have a large parking lot attached to the restaurant with at least 20 spaces. Only a few customers inside so we put our anti-covid-superpandemic-eradicater masks on and went straight up to the counter to order. Menu is typical BBQ joint, with full menu of goodies - pulled pork, brisket, chopped chicken, cole slaw, baked beans, etc.  My wife ordered the spare rib plate with green beans and Brunswick stew, also comes with cornbread. Ribs were a little dry but tasty - they come without sauce, you add the sauce, the stew was excellent and the green beans are the flat kind, but had a nice smoky flavor to them, a little underseasoned but still good. Cornbread was sweet, and moist not dry (I had to use the word MOIST - say it with me...\"moist\"...see don't you feel better after saying MOIST more than once today? You're welcome).  I had the chopped chicken plate with potato salad and coleslaw as my sides. Chopped chicken was a little underflavored and not enough sauce, so I added some of their sweet sauce later, so that turned out better. I like coleslaw on my BBQ samminch - yes I said samminch. SLAWBQ! The slaw was pretty good, a little more mayo and couple degrees colder would have been perfect but it was good. The only thing I didn't enjoy at first was the potato salad - I guess pandemics make people stop putting mustard in potato salad. I'm pretty picky about my tater-salad, and this was a letdown as it was probably made with mayo/sourcream/dill...not very southern (where's the MUSTARD?) so what I did was I went over to the sauce counter and got some of their \"Carolina mustard\" BBQ sauce and put that in the potato salad and Bingo it was better.  For my drink I had the unsweet tea with lemonade because yeah, tea and BBQ. They do have beer by the bottle but I was driving and didn't want to get a DUI and miss any of the wonderful goings-on in the world right now (lawdy I might have missed something as spectacular as that last superbowl halftime show)!  So if you are: 1. Looking for decent BBQ close to downtown 2. A BBQ place to \"dine in\" 3. A place to park at a BBQ joint without paying $20 to park 4. A no frills place where you won't get the evil-eye for eating without a mask on (yes masks are required to enter but you can take them off to eat, instead of eating by osmosis like many places expect you to lately) 5. Plenty of elbow room in the dining area 6. Good basic counter-service and fast food service  ...then this is your joint. Definitely recommend and will be back, with mustard in hand.",

There was no dedicated order pick-up area and they told me to stand in line with everyone else. After standing in line for 15 minutes they told me my food wasn\u2019t ready yet and said it should come out soon without asking/checking with the kitchen. Waited another 15 minutes at which point I voiced my displeasure and they finally checked in the kitchen. Turns out the food was ready and sitting there waiting for who knows how long. So by the time I got home the food was cold. Because all in all it took almost 1.5h before I could finally eat (between the wait time and the drive back) I didn\u2019t bother putting everything in the microwave or oven, but honestly speaking I don\u2019t think heating the food up would have made it much better. The ribs were dry, the brisket was dry and had a weird color, and the chicken wings had a sweet sauce that just wasn\u2019t it (and the chicken itself wasn\u2019t great either). The only thing that was kind of good was the pulled pork, but it was mostly because of the sauce. Green beans were bad, Mac and cheese was bland, and the fries were undercooked and had a pathetic attempt to some sort of seasoning on them. Anyways, decide for yourself if you want to go here or not. Judging from some of the other reviews here there are a lot people that enjoyed the food here. Maybe the restaurant just had a bad day; it did seem they were understaffed. I, however, am not inclined to give them another chance.",

I would\u2019ve been much better off staying in Mississippi and eating at Slap Ya Mama\u2019s for much less money than this. Don\u2019t breathe in when you eat the brisket, you might choke on the dry meat or the dry char on the outside of it. When you finish eating your first piece and work the cramps out of your jaw from chewing the thing, you might even notice the microwave marks under the meat. The macaroni tasted like you fished it out of the sink drain and threw some salt and pepper on it. I could\u2019ve bought a box of Kraft macaroni and went in their kitchen to cook it myself and had better and more macaroni for less money. The cornbread tasted like it came out the bottom of the garbage can too, old and crusty. The baked beans were the one decent thing on the plate. The least you could do if you\u2019re gonna serve flavorless food is serve it fresh, not microwaved. Also, for the cobbler: just don\u2019t do it. You could\u2019ve gone to Walmart and purchased the pre-made bag mix of cobbler and made a better pan. Thank god for the Great Value vanilla bean ice cream rescuing the day the best it could.",

Upon entering,  we were greeted by Solice B. who says she's the bartender but I don't think there's anything that woman CANNOT DO!! Had to almost run to catch her but her customer service was impeccable! I ordered pulled pork but they had ran out (it was relatively late when we entered).  That was no problem. Solice B. suggested the brisket so I ordered that along with some damn good green beans and crisp french fries. I have Celiac's and my brisket came out on bread. That, too, no problem.   She understood and my food was remade and my brisket came out on a plate so it didn't touch anything that could've been touched by gluten.  A very sweet young man named Art brought my remade food out to me and made sure that everything was ok. Folks,  I don't know what yall call customer service but if you don't know,  go to Bullpen Rib House and not only will you find great food,  you will find GREAT PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!",
