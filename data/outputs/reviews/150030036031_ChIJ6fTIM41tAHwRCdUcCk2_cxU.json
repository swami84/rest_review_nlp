I was silent when ordering and serving food, and it was a terrible response that made me wonder if something was wrong with this. It was really symmetrical with the friendly attitude with Korean customers who was excited about the nearby seats. Both of them felt depressed and didn't feel like enjoying the meal slowly, so they decided to finish up in a short time. At the very least, I only put chips below the average amount (about 10%) on the table as an indication of intention. When I tried to leave the store as it was, the clerk who confirmed the tip rushed aiming at me, grasped my shoulder, and I lacked the tip, so please give me the shortage! Yelled. I complained without losing, and I had a quarrel, but my wife was afraid and I was going to return early. I will never go to this store again.

I think this makes location number 4 for me and I like this one best.  This new location is clean, well lit, comfortable, and in a decent location.  It is a bit more comfortable then the last with the extra space.  Parking seems a little challenging this busy area, but the trick is to park at the Walmart and walk over verses hot and unreliable street parking.  Of course the tofu soup is the thing to eat there and they have an amazing lunch special where there are some very good deals to get other side dishes with your soup.  Of course your meal comes with the typical banchan.  Over the years, I don't think I have ever had a bad meal or experience with this restaurant.  Being a family business, they have always been very friendly.  Food always comes out hot, fresh, and well prepared.  I am a big fan of their original soondubu and seafood pancake.  They have a lot of other great stuff on the menu, but honestly never tried because I get the same stuff because it is so good.",

When a table finally opened up and we were very clearly the next in que, one of the younger waitresses started to direct us to the seats. All of a sudden the older server started yelling at her in Korean and pointed to a Korean couple that came in much later than us. The younger waitress sheepishly apologized (she knew it was wrong and was embarrassed) and claimed she made a mistake, then seated the couple, bypassing a lot of people. They discriminated against us and others because we were not Korean and acted like nothing happened. We ended up leaving and finding another place to eat at. I've always liked their food and usually over ordered so I could take the rest with me. They will never have my business again and I will be certain to tell everyone my experience that evening. If I could, I'd give their establishment a negative star rating.",

You can get refills on sides. It is a tiny restaurant and wait can be 20-30 min on a busy day but I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something other than KBBQ.",
