The Buffalo flavoring was a sauce in a shot glass sized container. The wings ranged from tiny to fairly decent sized. The Buffalo sauce was citrusy tasting with little kick to it. I doubt if I will be back. The patio was nice to sit in. Fairly isolated from the noise of Dale Mabry with the middle open to the sky.",

        "caption": "Fantastic bar/restaurant with amazing menu of all-scratch cuisine.  Stopped here with some friends and my two kids in the early evening after going to an event during the day. Great location, right on Dale Mabry less than a mile south of Raymond James Stadium. Parking was easy and ample. When you roll up, the place is attractive and welcoming.  Lots of outdoor seating and live music was a plus! The band playing was contemporary with no singer, but played recognizable songs that had people adding their own vocals.  The waitstaff was there to greet us and take drink orders as soon as we sat down. The menu selections were dynamic and there was something for everyone - even the kids! Salads, burgers, fresh fish, soups, prime rib, reubens and chicken, just to name a few.  I got the cider tomahawk pork chop with smoked bacon cole slaw and the wildcat shrimp to start. Everything came out cooked perfectly and to temp.  If you like going to a dinner where the food becomes the main topic, this place is for you! Everyone at the table ate while ranting about how great everything was - yes, even a 6 and 8-year-old. The pork chop was seasoned perfectly and the coke slaw... let me just say I consider myself a bit of a 'slaw connoisseur'... was absolutely amazing! I actually had to get one to-go. All of our meals were nothing short of perfect.  Overall, this establishment earned every on of the 5-stars. From the staff, to the meals, to the bartenders, and even the proprietor who came out and greeted us, making sure we had an excellent experience. We most certainly will be back again and again!",

The Hellcat wings were perfect, crispy, and perfectly prepared. The drinks were made well, and even hours later when we came back, they remembered our names. Top notch customer service.  The ambience is perfect.  RIVETERS, is obviously from \"rosie the riveter\" and the staff all play the part. They are beautiful and friendly and genuinely want to make sure you have a great time tonight and want you to come back. They succeeded, I will be a regular at Riveters from now on.  Highly recommended. Maha is amazing!!!!",
