The sandwiches were great cooked a beautiful medium/medium rare and they were portioned and priced very fairly. For the last 6 years I would eat here just about every time I came to the ballpark. But over the last 2 years the quality of the sandwiches has tanked apparently in relation to the O's performance but I digress.... The meat is consistently overcooked and always well done now(terrible for a pit beef sandwich) and the portion size has shrunk as well. When I saw they had jumped the price almost 50% this season(14 and change for a platter) and served me that overcooked and tough meat I can say I will not repeat as a customer anymore. It's sad too because I really used to enjoy it very much. I give it 2 stars because while the star of the show, the pit beef has gotten awful, the sides...slaw and beans have maintained and are still pretty good.",
