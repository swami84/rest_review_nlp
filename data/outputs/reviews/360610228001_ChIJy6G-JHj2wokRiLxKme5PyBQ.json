My experience went like this 3/different orders 3 different dates and from there this conclusion comes. One star for delivery quick and the delivery guys are super nice even if you live on the 5th floor of a walk up. The second star is for having your information always at hand and never having to repeat the address more than once but everything else is a mess. 1rst order. Asked for lite on the sauce I guess they didn't understand that lite sauce means very little sauce. 2nd order I asked for green peppers on a Philly cheese steak and they put red peppers and also they put sauce. Who in their right mind puts tomato sauce on a Philly. And 3rd order I wanted a meatlovers pie also the lite sauce that never happened and the next day I got food poisoning. So I wouldn't recommend this place. Sucks because the dough it's pretty good.",

Fast forward an hour and a half later I get a call from a private number telling me I placed an order for pickup and it has been ready for while but nobody ever picked it up. Now I know for sure I called for delivery because I asked before hand if they delivered to my address and she said yes. Also they don't take down your address if you're going to pick it up. So i called the shop back and obviously there's a miscommunication between the young lady who took my order and the guy that called me lying telling me i order for pick up. Maybe they don't delivery to my address and she just wasn't informed But communication is key and they failed terribly in that end.  After all that They wanted to deliver me a pizza that has been sitting there for more than hour waiting for me to so called pick it up. Pissed off is an understatement.",

There where about 10 kids ahead of me and they were totally ignored and finally when they decided to give the kids candy they talked to them real nasty. They didnt say anything to my kids because they were attended by me so i decided to write this due to the fact that you have a business in my neighborhood a black neighborhood and you expect 365 days of the year to spend money at your business and one day out of the year you talk yo the kids nasty and give the one piece of candy, oh no i dont think so. So if you are reading this do not support this business. Besides this summer before this i ate here and the pizza is discuisting and overpriced, no shade just the factz. Kings Pizza is on  145th a few blocks up and the pizza is amazing and the service is wonderful.",
