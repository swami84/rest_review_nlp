My issue is with the dominos driver Aminall who called me telling me to come downstairs & when I reached downstairs  in less then 5 mins he proceeded to call me yelling at me over the phone telling me my food has arrived where am I why am I not downstairs . WHEN I WAS ALREADY OUTSIDE IN THE COLD IN FRONT OF MY BUILDING . 15mins OF WAITING IN THE COLD FOR ME TO SEE HIM RIDING HIS BIKE UP TO THE BUILDING LAUGHING . DOES NOT APOLOGIZE THEN DEMANDS ME TO SIGN RECIPT AND TIP HIM. I TRIED CALLING 2 TIMES TO REPORT HIS BEHAVIOR & WAS BRUSHED OFF N PUT ON HOLD FOR 30 mins THEN WHEN SOMEONE DID ANSWER HE DECIDED TO HANG UP ON ME WHILE I WAS EXPLAINING. WILL NEVER SPEND MOMEY HERE AGAIN . Tried calling to take off his tip because he didn\u2019t deserve anything ! Horrible delivery",

I then just attempted to place my pizza in the bag the pizza was cold as if it has been sitting for a while. I told the man Sir my pizza is cold his responses was you took to long to pick up I showed him on the app the  pizza was ready at 10:02 its now 10:06 and I thought if this was for delivery  dominos had to deliver  hot pizza up to 30 minutes.Then he gets all upset and takes the pizza and say I'm going to refund your money. At that point I thought the customer was always right sad part is if this dominos was in a different part of town he would just made me another pizza simple.

A man with the heavy accent took my order not once did he say I could not get that deal  because I was calling my order in not when I repeated to him what I wanted and not when he repeated it back to me. Then he repeated my address which was wrong and I corrected it for him and again he repeated my address back to me but of course he didn't change the address so the delivery man was at the wrong place when he called me and said he was outside I go out no delivery man I call his phone and told him I was outside and gave him the correct address. When he arrived and gave me my order I asked where is my soda and other items he said everything was there i did not get upset with him not his fault. So I come to my house and called the store only to here the man with the heavy accent tell me I could not get the deal cause I called my order in I explained to the man how the website was having problems that's why I called in the first place.

She called to get a refund and the customer service was rude and talked over to her, and when she spoke to the manager they told her they were sorry and they will send the right order to her. When delivery came a third time, they sent a pie with cheese even though the manager wrote the order down twice and we called complaining about the same problem twice.

Today, 01/01/19, I placed an order at 11:58 am and the pizzas arrived at 1:14 pm, 1 hour and 12 minutes.  Again, I called the store at around 1:00 and was kept on hold until the pizza arrived, 14 minutes.  Again, no one answered my call to store # 3659.  On both occasions I asked the delivery person why the pizza was so late, and was told that the store was busy.  I will no longer order Dominos Pizza, and I have updated my online Pizza Hut account so that the next time my family wants to enjoy some pizza, we can do so without having to experience such terrible service.",

They should have called and notify me about it instead of making the decision for me. I hate sprite! The third strike really was unbelievable and truly makes me think that they hired cave men to make the food. My jalape\u00f1o and bacon cheese bread came with just literally one piece of jalape\u00f1o and one piece of bacon smack in the middle. Then I call the store to complain, I waited 30 minutes and no one picked up the phone. Who ever running this place needs to be fired along with the rest of the staff. I will never order from ever again!",
