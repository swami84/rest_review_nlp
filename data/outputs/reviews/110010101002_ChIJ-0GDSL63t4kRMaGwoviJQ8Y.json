Both the kale salad and mixed green salad were great and a good sized portion. The filet (ordered MR) was tender and sat on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes. They ran out of the creme brulee (very disappointing) but offered a carrot cake instead. It was very moist and had good cinnamon flavor. The service was pretty slow but we weren't in a rush- about a 2+hr meal, not including the 30 min HH.",

We ordered the steak and lamb,  which were both really tender and seasoned perfectly! The honey bacon brussel sprouts.... WOW!  The mac and cheese was different than we make at home but so cheesy and yummy. Even the plantains that are served with poblano aioli, which you get while you wait for your food were a perfect and light start. Our drinks were strong and tasty. I had the spicy pineapple margarita which was really inventive and good. We will definitely be returning!",

        "caption": "Excellent service and phenomenal food! Located near the Capitol Hilton, on 15th St NW, Claudia's classy elegance is a  great find. We began with cocktails and mussels. The bartender made a perfect old fashion and a solid regular mojito, not the one made like an icee.  The mussels were soaked in a white wine jalapeno sauce. To add to this deliciousness, fries were poured on the bottom to give us something to collect that awesome juice with.....a straw might also have worked. For our entree, we ordered the Lobster Paella for 2. This was a beautiful plate of food! This dish was overwhelming and wonderful to look at. A 2.5 pound lobster sat quite majestically in the middle of the pan on top of a gorgeous mound of saffron infused rice. Imbedded in the rice like little treasures we found shrimp and calamari, all surrounded by more mussels than I could count...or eat. We did not need that appetizer and there was plenty left over. Did I mention the wine list that was decent but had few by the glass options. They want you to buy the bottle. We chose the Oakwood Merlot, which was very tasty. There was also live music, flamenco dancers. The music was awesome but the dancers a tad underwhelming in comparison. I am used to a more vibrant flamenco than these ladies presented. This is now a go to restaurant when I am in DC. For the area it is very decently priced. The two of us had drinks and dinner for $150 plus tip. We had a District Discount Card, given to us at the Hilton as Hilton Honors members, which gave us 15% off our bill. Parking is always an issue in this part of DC, well all of DC, so plan to pay. Claudia's is well worth the your time should you find yourself in D.C.",

Well,  after arriving and waiting 1.5 hours after our reservation to be sat,  things got worse.  They were out of several items on the menu, which should have been told before we went to order.  We ordered the paella which turned out to be bad.  The muscle didn't taste fresh, perhaps wrotten. The lobster was overcooked and when I notified them that I didn't like it, I ordered a burger which was good but the fries were cold and soggy.  Then, the check came and they had the paella and burger on the bill!  I had to ask to have the paella removed off the check.   Finally,  after 3 hours of a terrible experience (sush a shame with such a nice atmosphere) where the dishes and paella were still in front of us until the end, we got up to depart. There was a comment from the staff implying it was my fault that I didn't like the lobster.   Um, no I didn't like the entire experience including the rotten muscles, and rubbery lobster which I was going to try to chew my way though but the butter I asked for never came!",

We held a company event there in December 2018 and the event coordinator Aron Schultz was horrible to deal with.  It took him weeks to respond to my requests, but the \"real magic\" happened on the day of out holiday event,. 1.  They were late with the set-up.  When we walked in, it was like they were not having our event. HE apologized and claimed to be sick the previous day.   Staff sat outside of the room with a dazed and confused look as they scrambled to set things up.  2. Serving utensils were missing, we paid for a full bar, alcohol came out late. 3.  I had to ask then to start bringing the food to the group.  Drama! While the staff recovered well enough, it was Aron's bad attitude about the entire ordeal that sucked.  After the event, I reached out to him to see what the restaurant would be willing to do on our invoice to compensate for the service issues.  He said that they are not responsible for issuing credits for every customer who is dissatisfied with the level of service they provide.  isn't that what real reputable businesses do, correct their mistakes?  They were wiling to give a small credit to compensate for their service mayhem, but to add insult to injury,  that tactless General Manager Marlon Alfaro said that no further discount or credits would be applied to our account. I would be surprised if this place is in business this spring.   What a horrible experience!  I will be telling EVERYONE in my social circle and  professional network NEVER to use them for anything!   Thumbs DOWN to this place!",

The dining room prices Id say are good to great for the locale. However, the happy hour & bar menu prices are just absolutely amazing. Truth is, Claudia\u2019s is considered a hidden jem to those that bust their chops on the K street corridor. I\u2019m very grateful that I can let loose and get served quality within a short period of time. All without breaking the bank. That\u2019s probably why the local K street event managers in the know, religiously make Claudia\u2019s the indefinite go to bar for Xmas, New Years, & weekly to monthly morale parties. I find that most of the time the bar is relatively busy. However, when it isn\u2019t the bartenders are always very attentive and gracious. I guess that with all the nightclubs in the area Claudia\u2019s is a great special occasion & pregame spot.",

If your looking to pregame or even blow off some steam after work this is without a doubt the place to go. Rail spirits and most bottled beers run ONLY $5, which is absolutely unheard of on K street. There\u2019s also a happy hour bar menu which is way way above par. I would describe the food as steakhouse oriented with a Spanish influence. The bar almost needs their own review as the bartenders are a totally eclectic group of pro\u2019s. They churn out killer drinks as if they could do it in their sleep. And when they\u2019re not bogged down with cocktail orders each and everyone is an absolute pleasure to talk to. Thank you, Matt & Chuck we\u2019ll be seeing you soon. Cheers!!",

However, I was disappointed with table service. Many moons ago, I was a restaurant server myself so I am usually easy on servers. But my dining experience at Claudia's last week, left me and my guests feeling a tad disrespected by our server because we were ignored for most of the evening (before and after our food came out). We sat unattended with empty water glasses at many points throughout the evening. I rounded up my closest family and friends for a special night out in town -my birthday celebration, and had a limo driver waiting on us outside (we exceeded our limo rental time by waiting around for our server). Our server did not do the minimal gesture of wishing me a happy birthday.  There was zero engagement. We paid the $25 cake cutting fee which was reasonable because we brought in an outside two tier cake. After handing the cake over to the server to take in the kitchen to cut and bring back out to serve, one of my sisters had to follow up to see if she was planning to bring the cake back out anytime soon? We spent a chunk of money on our tab, and expected at least good, if not exceptional service.  In sum, the food was great. Service not so great.",

The most dissapointing occurence was when upon waiting forever for my dessert (friends already had theirs) I decided I wanted bread pudding and the manager Brett LIED and said they ran out. He told me they were out of bread pudding but yet 10 minutes later I witnessed waiters serving another table bread pudding  This was not a good dining experience.Boooo...I won't be back!",

The drunken ribeye is one of their signature dishes and it didn't disappoint. This steakhouse is true to its specialty in that all the steaks at the table were greatly enjoyed. However, the Lamb has room for  improvement. I am looking forward to going back with a group of friends for a special event on a Saturday night to enjoy dinner, music and dancing. Review update: I went back for a special event in the private room and it was amazing. Food was delicious and the party all night was night was fun with great drinks.

The salad was mostly iceberg lettuce but the sauce and accompanying ingredients made a refreshing dish. The salmon, a fish very easily overcooked, was delightfully tender without being raw. The side of asparagus could be charred a little less. Mashed potatoes have a hidden spiciness to them! The beer soaked brown sugar drunken ribeye steak was pretty good overall, however they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked. When asked, they said they cook a tender pink medium steak but did not take a request to make it medium rare. Strangely while most of the steak was a tender medium consistency, a smaller side portion was closer to a better medium rare to rare consistency. The cheesecake was pretty good overall. The warm chocolate cake was a bit dry on the sides but delicately smooth like pudding. The desserts had a contrasting tart sauce that overpowered the cheesecake just a little bit.",

A friend had a birthday dinner on 12/28/2016. There was another party of 3 complaining to the hosts and manger while we waited for our waiter, I probably should have excused myself from the dinner at that point, but I stayed. Our waitress (don't remember her name, I'm not even sure that she gave it to us)didn't take any drink orders so the 9 of us had to drink the complimentary water that they pored into our glasses, our food was cold, not seasoned or good and in VERY small portions. I eat in high priced restaurants often and I don't mind paying if the food is worth it, this wasn't worth it. It's not like they were crowded so I can't even say this was a bad day. I will never know because I won't visit this place every again. The only reason they got 1 star is because I couldn't post it without rating them.",

Staff was fantastic and we enjoyed the complementary plantain crisps and amuse-bouche of the chef's soup selection was nice way to set expectations.  Pros:  side dishes were large and plentiful for sharing, we got the honey-fried Brussel sprouts (good, but not fabulous) and French fries (seasoned and done the way I like); the rack of lamb was a set of two thick portions (6 ribs) and was well prepared (I was happy that med-rare was pretty rare); the drunken steak was alright, but my friend ordered it med-well, so it was too done for me; the petite filet mignon was nice, but I've tasted better; booth was nice and comfortably fix 5 adults and made it easy to face each other and share plates. Cons:  there is live flamenco music and dancers, which was entertaining, but MUCH too LOUD for conversation with a group.  Over all, I would say it may be pricy, but fine for a date night where you can sit close to the person you want to talk with or just not talk at all. LoL I probably won't go back for dinner, but I would stop in for their happy hour at the bar and try that - looked like it was most of their Small Plates priced ~$3 cheaper and tempting cocktails in the $5 to $7 range.",

I had the steak and he had the fist my steak was super tender and cooked/seasoned to perfection. I was given three sauces to try and loved the oil based sauces with herbs. The dancers and band were great entertainment I even got up and danced with them. The management checked on us a few times and it made us feel so welcomed and with the service, food and overall experience I can't wait to go back and hope that will be consistent !!

The place was over  crowded , and the drinks toke forever to come let alone we had to share the drink menu with another party and had a limited of time to look at the menu. The foods was  actually good when it came , the event restaurant manager, was nasty as well as the waiter,  and was not apologetic about the situation at all ! He took of one round of drinks and top it off they ran out of wine  glasses so when we took our last sip they to our glasses to give them to another table ,   Unbelievable I've never been to a restaurant that do something like this , if I had to recommend This place to a friend I would recommend you spend your hard earned money with a another restaurant with better service and know how to accommodate there guest while having a event in the restaurant at the same time !",

I ordered drunken ribeye, which was okay while my wife had the teraki steak which was good.  Our friends ordered the crab cake which was good but she was expecting it to be larger or two of them while her husband ordered the flounder which was somewhat bland, no real flavor.  The service was okay but bartender on 2 different occasions messed up ( drink order and brusslesprouts came with bacon which wevdudntbask for).  For dessert I ordered white chocolate cheesecake for all of us to share which was at best a C-.  Everyone had one small piece was not satisfied.  There was no white chocolate taste and not much cheesecake taste.  Not a bad place (did I mention there was no valet parking) but I experienced Claudia's for the 1st and last time, many local restaurants that are better.",
