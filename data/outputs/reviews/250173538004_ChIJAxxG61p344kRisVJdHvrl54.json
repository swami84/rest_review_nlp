The sandwich was also missing the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. It was turkey on bread. No refund yet either despite my requests since I couldn't eat it.",

I ordered an omelette, it was so old and unappealing I couldn't even eat it.  I ordered it with 2 portions of bacon and it had just cheese in it. I called them to try and make it right, they told me that I live too far away and they wouldn't come back with the correct item. The person I then spoke with told me that they ran out of bacon and substituted bacon bits, which is totally unacceptable without contacting me. If the bacon bits were even in there, I could not find any, let alone 2 portions worth. She just kept insisting it was correct. I contacted grubhub and the best I could get was for them to refund half the price of the omelette. Terrible customer service.",

Not only did it take an hour over what their original delivery estimate was, I got the \"Avocado and Brie rollup\" and it had about a thimble full of Avocado and even less Brie.  If it was titled a \"Mostly lettuce & a half of tomato rollup\" it would have been more accurate. The fries I got were so watered down because they were probably in a car for two hours that I threw them out!  My coworker described his steak bomb as \"It tasted like steak that a gardener used a hose on.\" because it was so soggy.  And not soggy in a \"Wow, there is so much grease on here, I love it!\" kind of soggy, but in an embarrassing \"Wow, this has been sitting in this wax paper for an hour + and all of the steam is now water vapor ruining the sandwich.\" kind of soggy.  This place offends me to my core and my lunch is ruined!  I think I may go home now and punch a pillow a few times to relieve some stress!!!",
