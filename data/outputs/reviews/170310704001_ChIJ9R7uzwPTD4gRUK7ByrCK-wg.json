But OVERALL great selection of fish, the tuna and eel in particular. Their specialty Nigri was worth it, definitely recommend both of the signature smoked, Juno king/queen, a few of the specialty Nigri (hotate and zuke sake) with the eel and tuna trios. The strawberry covered chocolate truffles were also very good!",

In that test you have the ability to notice subtle differences, even in the quality and cook of the rice.

You could pick any roll and it would taste amazing. The homemade soy sauce is unbelievable. Every roll we got was immediately recognizable as of higher quality and structure. Not too much rice or anything, you could say the rolls were \u201cperfectly balanced, as all things should be.\u201d A clear winner in the Chicago sushi taste test among many of my sushi loving friends and family.",

Although the restaurant offers a variety of fish, they are cut to very, very thin slices to a point you cannot taste the flavour/texture of the specific fish. The rice is also small. We felt like we were eating miniature sushi. To give it some credit there were one or two good pieces. Overall I left feeling like I\u2019ve been ripped off. If this deserves a 4.6 in Chicago then perhaps the only places we can have sushi is omakase-only restaurants.",

Our waitress knew the menu exceptionally well, and walked us through the more popular items. She noted things that tend to sell out, things that they fly in daily and a few of her personal favorites and why.  The sushi itself was amazing. A little pricey, but for the quality of fish that we had, definitely worth the money. We splurged and got some fatty tuna among other things.  Cocktails were solid. Not the best but on par with the rest of service at a minimum. The sake that was recommended to us was surprisingly light, and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  My only quip was about the size of the tables. For how sushi is presented, with drinks, water, and etc, table ends up very crowded. The kitchen does spread your food out, but nonetheless it's a little tight.  Overall, one of the best dinner experiences we've had in the city.",

Weekends are busy, be prepared for a wait during peak times. It is a small restaurant and small staff.  If you want an Omakase you MUST call and book it in advance. It cannot be booked online. I absolutely reccomend trying it if you can.  There is a front room (with a bar by the door, quieter) and a back room (with a sushi bar, main dining area ). You can never know where you\u2019ll be placed unless you call and ask. If it\u2019s important to you to be seated in the back then you must make a reservation early, and call to confirm the seating area.  I won\u2019t deny it\u2019s expensive and portions are small, but ingredients are top notch and very fresh. The cuts of fish aren\u2019t oversized and thick like most bargain sushi places. Their selection is very traditional sushi with a modern flair. If you want a California roll don\u2019t come here.  All that being said; the best time to go is probably on a Thursday night. I reccomend trying the uni shooters, smoked hamachi, seared scallop pasta dish, and any of the nigiri samplers they have. Drink sake. Any sake. Amazing.  Thanks!",

        "caption": "This was a saddening experience. When you want sushi, you want one of two things: cheap massive quantities of fish and rice or a culinary explosion of wonders in your mouth that leaves your tongue as satisfied as your stomach. This place, strangely, was neither.  The ambience was loud--despite the barely audible music, sound carried too well, and despite the few diners, it was not the setting I would expect or want for the price or attitude. Otherwise, the interior design was a fresh taste from the red and black color scheme seen at most sushi/Japanese restaurants.  The service was slow. Our waiter walked like a muted robot, and an older Japanese lady (the host? owner/owner's wife?) walked at about half a mile an hour and would hovered near your table before swooping in to take that empty juice glass. I could tell she was zeroing in on our table well before she actually stepped forth into official presence. That bit was odd. But beyond these petty observations, the service was simply slow. We ordered two sakes, which for some reason took 5-10 minutes to arrive, then when we finished those and ordered another two, it took again about 10 minutes for the new glasses to arrive. We ordered appetizers--basic stuff, nothing complicated--and waited 10-20 minutes for the first to arrive. By the time both arrived we ordered the main sushi dinners. Our waiter said the sashimi chef's choice ($42) was enough for two people: my cousin finished it in two minutes, not nearly satisfied. Of course, with 5+ sushi chefs working behind me, each sushi dinner we ordered took between 10 and 20 minutes to reach our table. We ordered a plate of nigiri/sashimi each, then maybe four extra rolls totalling $270, and were never full. Partly, I think, because they decided we needed to wait 20+ minutes between each minuscule course. I considered, upon leaving, finding a cheap sushi place to fill up on. We spent maybe two hours there and were wholly unsatisfied.  The food, at this point an afterthought, was okay. It was not worth the price, but it had highlights. Skip the chef's choice nigir/sashimi dishes ($40, $42 respectively). They were uninteresting and unfulfilling for the price (wasabi seemed a little overbearing in the nigir for a couple of the fish as well). A few Maki rolls were delicious and definitely worth the price, but with the quantity balanced against the massive wait, it wasn't worth it.  If you, like me, miss Katsu's and are looking for a replacement, this isn't it. Though, if their service sped up (like 2-3 times as fast) and the price lowers a couple bucks, it might be worth revisiting.",

Once seated, I definitely had a good view of the back room and I could see a number of empty tables. During the whole meal, those tables remained empty. Either they were reserved and people canceled or we weren't deemed good enough for the back room.  Whatever the reason, the food was really tasty. Didn't wait too long for the food to come out and the presentation was pretty spot on. I would eat here again.",

To start their estimate of a 15 minute wait turned into 45 minute wait, but this is excusable since we were walk-ins on a Friday night. Once they sat us we put in an order with our wait person and told him that we were probably going to order more once we had some more time with the menu. This was the last time we saw him until he dropped off the check, which we had to ask the host for. We were never asked if we wanted anything to drink and we never had a chance to order more food. We left still hungry and very perplexed.",

The staff were all very nice and informative about the food that was served. We got the chef's choice sashimi, some nigiri and single sashimi and finished off with desert. Everything was really good. One small downside was that sashimi was served on ice so it was cold and that caused some of the flavors to be lost. The desert we got was very good (panna Cotta). It's definitely on the more expensive side, but if you're looking to splurge for a dinner then it's a good place to go.",

They offer three types of desserts, and all of them were a delight. Another annoying thing is that they do not take away emptied plates in a timely manner, yet it is somewhat typical for US restaurants.",
