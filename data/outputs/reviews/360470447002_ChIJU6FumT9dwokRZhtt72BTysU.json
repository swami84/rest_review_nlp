If we were willing to pay, it was the first time we went to that place, we will never go again and I will recommend it as a bad place forever.

They are all flavorful, tastes fresh and really great portion sizes. The drinks I've tried, grapefruit Cosmo and strawberry wine drink, were really good too!

HOWEVER their service was pretty awesome especially when I happened to be there while it started pouring rain to the point it didn't matter the outdoor dining areas were covered like everyone was soaking wet but they honestly handled it all like amazingly considering most places these days cant handle confused customers trying to order just unsure since every single place is different but the only common denominator is there's some weird ordering way or thing in place just you don't know what it is lol maybe theres a special place they order and then wait? or find a QR code and/or go online to order? find a small paper taped up with the menu and how to order in a font size 10 or smaller expected to be read by everyone and seen? or simply and also the most obvious one - being telepathic and sending your order/asking questions to anyone working via both of your telepathic mind control powers? so not only did this place totally not do that LIKE EVERY OTHER PLACE AROUND THERE but really killed it at customer service and went above and beyond for a ton of people depending on each situation whether it was take out, dining outside and getting rained on etc - it was noticeable and much appreciated so kudos to the entire staff because every single person working there was SO nice and would attempt to help or immediately find someone who could. super attentive in a good way. food was lacking .. a lot. maybe I'm just not a fan of pan asian restaurants like that? but I kinda knew what I was getting into before ordering the second I saw the glossy picture filled menu that looked like something from a chile's or like fridays etc type chain lol thanks again to the staff there that night - you guys were great and deserve to know it and compliments on that :)",

Their Thai which was once good is bland and tasted premade. If you want Thai walk down Wyckoff to Klom Klom.  Asked to add chicken to the eggplant stir fry dish and was told no bc it is made only vegetarian. The chicken wings had no flavor or dipping sauce just lots of fried bland batter. The staff is brisk and will not stagger apps and entrees. The bathrooms are also now much dirtier then they used to be. Lastly then menu has changed a lot too- now there happens to be call out best value or most recommended  stickers on higher price items. I have a feeling it changed owners bc something is seriously lacking.",

Pros: hostess had a free table near the door (drafty and cold), but had the foresight to clear off one closer to the back so we could sit there without us even saying anything! It\u2019s really lovely when staff thinks ahead, and never expected. The food was tasty as well, and the prices were totally fair.  Cons: right off the bat, the server told us they were out of two key proteins on the menu. I can understand 86\u2019s happen, but to be missing two entire proteins? Our meat eating friends weren\u2019t thrilled. The other things are very small - asked for hot oil and got a paste (just a heads up would have avoided any annoyance), and the tomato slice in my ramen had a huge, brown, hard core in the center. I totally understand not wanting to waste the tops of tomatoes but please at least cut out the inedible part! Broth was a bit weak also \u2014 to be fair, I asked for vegetable broth when their staple is fish, but it still should have been richer.  I\u2019d be happy to come here again.",

The staff were a bit distracted and disorganised even of it was early and not very full. On the menu they out chef names so I thought the food would be good, but it was very mediocre at best. After having lived in Asia for years maybe my standards are too high, but the food here was very bland. It was tasty, just nothing what special or exciting. A shame, of they improved on the food the place could be pretty amazing.",

There is no happy hour deal here but you can pre game across the street. I was early to meet friends here. The food here is amazing thou as well as their drink selection. I advice anyone to make a RSVP for this spot as they can fill up even on a weekday. Great place to meet and hear your friends as well as dating.  Food is amazing. My Malaysian noodle dish taste authentic. The flavour hits how I expected. We shared a sushi platter. Roll and sushi are masterfully made and the quality is way above the cheap sushi you find in your local Japanese restaurant. Sorry I paid too much attention to my dish and good company, i totally ignore my friends food. They looked like they enjoy them.  I was surprised when my friend told me this spot has three of the most popular Asian food.",

Each bun is $4, which seems like a lot, but worth the price.  The only negative was that our food did not come out at the same time.

Good presentation of the food. However, the food itself didn't hit all the notes for us. Prices are reasonable and drinks are reasonably priced as well.

We ended up putting the mushrooms in the ramen just to get a little flavor. The ramen itself was also not great. It was also pretty bland. We really don't have the highest of standards either to pass the threshold of not writing a negative review. Maybe it was an end of shift on a Tuesday sort of problem.

Service tonight was practically non-existent; one gentleman at the door was the only person to help us (and it seemed like he was doing most everything), otherwise we were politely ignored by the rest of the staff. Nobody was rude, but eye contact or a check in at any point would have felt welcoming.  We ordered pork bao buns, chicken dumplings, a red curry with tofu and an egg noodle curry dish I can't remember the name of. Of the dishes, the bao buns were very fatty (which I thought was ok, but my partner wouldn't finish) and the red curry had so much fish sauce it was inedible. But the dumplings were good and the egg noodle dish was very good.  Hoping it's a one off and they're just figuring things out.  Update: Updated to 4 stars for the amount of delicious takeout I order from there. Still haven't been back in to dine, but the food has been excellent and delivery fast and accurate.",

I'm usually not into pork broth, but this one was VERY good. The 2 slices of pork were cooked to melt in your mouth \ud83d\udc45 the egg was v delicious. The portion size couldn't be more perfect. The service was EXCELLENT also! Since Lucy's closed, we needed a neighborhood noodle spot \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc UPDATE: 5\u2b50x2 Had ramen, chicken clear soup, and chiang mai noodle delivered. Three separate orders. I'll never order noodles from another place again. First of all, they know how to pack it. I've never had anything that travelled this well. Second, they delivered to my door, not the building door, at least 20 minutes early every time. Third, THIS IS THE BEST CHICKEN SOUP PERIOD and that's on period! I actually hate chicken but I'm sick and desperate. I would eat this every day omgg. They threw three eggs in my ramen \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc the flavor is perfect and it looks beautiful. Please take all of my money.",

It was honestly pretty gross. Super fishy, and unappetizing. The server (who was great) took it away from the table while the rest of us ate.  We got 10 sushi rolls, and 3 tonkatsu ramen aside from that with the intention to bring things home for later. So when we got the bill and saw that the seafood ramen was still on it, my mom complained. I've been a server for the last 7 years, so I KNOW how annoying that is, but she was paying. Mind you, she ate absolutely none of it, and they took the whole bowl away untouched. In my experience, if we take food away at the customer's request untouched, we take it off the bill. Anyway, the owner/manager came over and started arguing with her. He had the gall to say that we ordered too much food! So rude!  I'm pretty torn. The food is usually good and it's been our favorite date spot, but to comment on how much food we ordered was gross. I really don't know if we'll go back.  Idk. Moral of the story, DO NOT order the seafood ramen. And if you have an issue with your order you just might be insulted by the owner.",

The bar was beautiful. We sat upstairs in a loft dining area. It felt like you were in exotic treehouse, dining in the tropics.  We shared the following.  Drinks: Sapparo draft beer, iced green tea and Echigo stout. The stout was refreshing and had a hint of coffee.  Sashimi special- this was so good and fresh. Esp for a restaurant serving both Thai and Japanese food. Reading the reviews, people complained about the quality of the fish. There were no complaints here.  The salmon was fatty and unctuous. The yellow tail was fresh. The tomago was soft and melted in our mouths. The scallop was sweet and so tender (this was my favorite piece). The botanical ebi head was creamy and fried to a great crunch. The otoro was very creamy and satisfying.  The chirashi bowl- this was also fresh! And the sushi rice had bits of sweet pickled vegetables and mushrooms to add texture to the rice! I liked the lean tuna, the shrimp and the salmon roe.  The seafood ramen was good- very rich flavors. I loved the added poach egg. The noodles were springy. The shrimps were good, the clams were plump but the broth was a little salty.  Chiang Mai noodles- this was slightly spicy sweet curried noodles (a version of Kaho Soi). I love the noodles! The curry was good, slightly sweet from coconut milk. The chicken chunks were a little overcooked and dry.  Beef Yakitori- good chunks of beef. It was a little dry but very flavorful.  Toro pork (pork belly)- This was the best Yakitori. The juicy crispy pork belly went perfectly with the yuzu pepper paste. This was a wonderful amazing mind blowing bite!  Shiitake Yakitori- this had a smoky flavor. It was a little undercooked and dried.  Dessert:  Coffee Jelly- concentrated coffee jelly topped with vanilla and coffee ice cream. The coffee tasted like nitro drip. It was very strong. It tasted like an affogato but with totally different textures.  Anmitsu Parfait- this had chewy delicious mochi with corn flakes, vanilla ice cream, red bean paste and topped with brown sugar syrup. This was my favorite dessert! I loved the mochi and all the blends of textures and varying levels of sweetness.  Matcha Mousse- green tea on the outside, vanilla mousse on the inside and paired with an adorable mouse-like yuzu sorbet with a mint leaf as its ears. This was my 2nd fav dessert.  This was an great meal with varying flavors and strengths. I would definitely reorder the Sashimi special, the Toro pork Yakitori, the anmitsu parfait and the matcha mousse.  @snackchatnyc",

In my office (which is just down the block from where you guys are located) we order the lunch especial \"Pho soup\" the presentation was truly nice, the side order which was the spring roll was small but very tasty, all good up to there but the Pho was pretty bad, nothing of flavor what so ever, the soup itself was mainly water with two or three pieces of meat, too much onion and the noodle which is the cheapest part of the meal were very little.  For having so many good reviews I'm surprised that I am one of the few that are negatives, and it is not just me. We order four of the Pho soups and all of my colleges gave their opinion on how never again we will order food from this restaurant after this experience.  Thank you,",
