The staff seated us at the table next to the restroom with a loud speaker while there were three huge communal tables open (those tables remained open the entire experience). We asked to move where they placed us in a high top next to the bar. We could barely fit so we eventually waited for seats at the bar. The menu seemed great..we went with the pork belly, mushrooms and gnocci. Pork belly was good but very big for two people since it's so fatty/oily. We were looking forward to the mushrooms (hoping for no something fresh), but they were underwhelming in flavor and again pretty oily. The gnocchi was a nice portion,  but they were in a bed of butter. Maybe we ordered the wrong items. The tastes all blended together and by the end we couldn't handle anymore fat without the flavor. For $150 on three items, we felt more taken advantage of rather than taken care of.",

All REALLY good in my opinion but everyone loved the empanaditas. The duck egg was okay but our least favorite. Not bad for a Friday night dinner from 9PM - 11PM.

We had to return a glass of wine because of some cork in it and the glass was filthy . Yes atmosphere was nice but simply not enough if you also want decent food . It s A big NO !",

The meat inside was delicious!  Pork belly: pretty good, but SO overpriced for the quantity.  Lamb chop: not the best, in my opinion, but my partner seemed to like it. Also overpriced.  Bread: the bread was actually super good, especially with their special butter spread over.  With that said, we ordered about $50 of food, but left still slightly hungry. Likely won't come again.",

I saw some customers squinting to see the menu and I had to take a pic so I can read it and not stand in the middle of the restaurant like a jack ass. It's a stupid idea. I work in restaurants and i just left work and didn't want to cook after working a busy brunch and i think the chef in any restaurant would understand. I should have listen to my husband and had dinner at work but I wanted to try something new but in my restaurant our shrimp dish comes with past and veggies. Our shrimp r regular size but it will fill u up. Unlike their food. I got 3 jumbo large shrimp and very little saut\u00e9ed greens and it was very pricy. If I ordered an appetizer I can understand the mix up but we wouldn't have had that if they had actual menus that said appetizer and entrees. And its only a few cents for potato's, pasta or a rice. I paid $15 for 3 very large and very good but not very worth the money shrimp. I wanted a meal they gave me an appitizer.",
