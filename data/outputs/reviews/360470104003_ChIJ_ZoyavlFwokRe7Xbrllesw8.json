        "caption": "This place is great! Such a good addition to the sunset park Chinatown food scene. A little hard to find because it's not on the main 8th Avenue drag. It's up the block on 57th street, on the 2nd floor. They have a huge well lit awning though so just look up! Found this place by accident back in December when I had a craving for Japanese. My family and I got a few bento boxes to try and we've been back multiple times ever since. We've had the salmon teriyaki bento, shrimp teriyaki bento, shrimp tempura bento, chicken teriyaki bento and my personal favorite,  the age tofu bento. All bento boxes come with Taiwanese style popcorn chicken, rice, a California roll and miso soup. I've also tried their take on an okonomiyaki, which they call the To Date pancake.  It's very tasty and comparable to the ones you find in the city. Their takoyaki isn't great. But I guess, you can't win them all. I always call my order in advance for pickup. It is usually ready within 20 minutes of calling. The guy who answers the phone is super nice and professional. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good quality and delicious Japanese food in Brooklyn!",
