We had lunch today 4 sandwiches and a coffee which cost $65. A takeout burger is $19.   We ordered at 2pm and were told it would be a  20 minute wait for the take out food.  After asking what was going on  45 minutes later,  a server went in and got our takeout food. Apparently someone forgot to get it. Given the wait the toasted bread on the sandwiches was soggy and the coffee cold. To add insult to injury I wanted to use the bathroom since we were waiting so long and when I tried to go a server stopped me and said the bathroom is only for patrons dining in.  A fair of people seem to go here as it\u2019s centrally located in Concord.   I am sure there are other better places in the area.",

When we showed up we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait and ended up waiting over 45 minutes. The three of us ordered lattes, the fried chicken sandwich, the gyro, and avocado toast. The lattes took over 20 minutes after we ordered and were basically just warmed milk so we asked for an extra black coffee to top them off with and it didn't even change the flavor. Our food took almost an hour and only the sandwich was warm. My friend who ordered the avocado toast couldn't even eat all of it even though we hadn't eaten today yet because it was so bad. As we were finishing our meal another patron yelled that if anyone was there that wrote restaurant reviews to give this place a terrible review. As we were leaving we considered warning all the people that waiting to not waste their time there. This was probably one of my top five worst restaurant experiences.",

Ordered a salad to go because we were out of time. Some how our 2 $12 entrees and single egg added up to a $50 bill, because that\u2019s how math works. Pretty sure we paid for a different table. Can\u2019t be sure because they don\u2019t actually allow you to see a receipt. To top it all off, they didn\u2019t close the lid to my salad, so it was spilled at the bottom of the take out bag.

The food was tasty and the staff were friendly, but I was concerned about the lack of social distancing with the seating arrangements. Yes, the staff were all wearing masks and there was hand sanitiser everywhere. However, halfway during our meal they seated a party of six adults on the other side of the picnic table we were on. There\u2019s a plastic barrier separating the two halves of the table on the tabletop, but not for the seats. We shifted as far to the end of our side of the table as possible, but even as two adults and two small children there was probably only 2 ft of space between us and the other party. All the other tables we could see looked pretty busy by then and we\u2019d nearly finished, so we didn\u2019t bother asking to move tables and just finished as quickly as we could.  Sharing tables in Covid times is problematic enough, without trying to squeeze ten people on one table when they\u2019re not in the same party. Probably two couples on far ends is as close as is safe on those things. I probably won\u2019t be back as a result, which is a shame given the food was nice.",

I also saw a staff member disinfect tables and chairs between groups. I'm giving it only 4 stars because for the price, the food seemed just okay. The burger we ordered arrived incorrectly (missing cheese, condiments, but with dressing we specifically requested to omit), and the hollandaise sauce on my benedict seemed a little coagulated. However, I recognize this is probably an effect of both the pandemic strain and new systems rolled out in response. Our experience was still good and we will be returning :)",

Try their sweet, home baked, cornbread- it's DELICIOUS!  The menu is varied in offerings & price, so usually something for everyone. The BLT comes made on huge slices of the home-made bread & hamburgers are quite tasty. There's also lots of fancier fare, so there's sufficient choice. Flavored hot coffee is always available & bakery items are EXCELLENT - especially the cookies & gingerbread!  Staff can be great or substandard, particularly the younger waitresses who are aggressive about taking tables, but have insufficient training or skills to service them. Attribute inconsistencies in service to erratic, inefficient, management. And, know it's not personal, so shrug off the often rude or disinterested servers & be prepared to ask for something multiple times - it's pot luck when it comes to service, counter take-out or table.  Lunchtime seems to be their busiest time, so expect a little wait, whether dining in or doing take-out.  There is pretty outdoor seating, too, if you don't mind purchasing your food & walking w/ it outside & around to the back of the restaurant. Because this is an OLD building, access to outdoor seating is a little maze-like.  Amazing live music is offered weekly; with limited seating capacity, expect the place to be packed, but, worthwhile. Reserving a table ahead of time is a smart option.  Finally, if seated inside, do make sure to appreciate the charming framed pictures & newspaper clippings offering glimpses into yesteryear ;)",

Unfortunately, Main Streets isn\u2019t worth it.  Now I know what other residents have been complaining about.  My recent experiences at Main Streets have been horrible.  The only bright spot is if you sit at the bar.  The bartender is great.  She is polite, competent, efficient, and pleasant \u2013 all the things her colleagues aren\u2019t.  My family and I will be avoiding Main Streets and I suggest you do the same.  There are other more worthy restaurants in town who appreciate their customers.  My most 3 most recent experiences are below.  July 2019 \u2013 Strike 3 - Given my previous bad experiences dining here for lunch and dinner (see below), I decided to try Main Streets one last time by ordering take out.  This was another failure.  I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 10-20 minutes.  I arrived 18 minutes later.  My order hadn\u2019t even been put it.  The staff offered to put my order in and have it rushed.  I declined.  The last thing I wanted was rushed, ill-prepared food and to wait another 20 minutes.  May 2019 \u2013 Strike 2 \u2013 I was meeting a colleague at Main Streets for a quick business lunch.  I arrived early to get a table so we could get in and get out.  Even though there was plenty of room in the dining room, the waitress didn\u2019t want to seat us.  She wanted to put us in the burrito bar.  Having been to the burrito bar previously, I didn\u2019t want to sit there again.  It\u2019s not a conducive setting for a business/nice lunch.  After discussing this for some time with the waitress, I finally pointed out that my colleague and I would be eating for the same amount of time, 1 hour, as most of their other patrons.  So, what was the problem with sitting in the dining room, especially since there was plenty of space?  March 2019 \u2013 Strike 1 - Three other dads and I went to Main Streets for a beer at 8:45 PM.  There was plenty of space available, so we picked a table for 4 in the bar area.  The waitress came over and asked what we wanted to eat.  We told her we only wanted beers.  She told us that even though there was only 15 minutes before the kitchen closed and even though there was plenty of empty tables, all of the tables were only for patrons ordering food.  We said okay, we\u2019ll look at the menu.  We ordered 4 beers.  When she came back, we told her we\u2019d like the nachos.  She rudely said, \u201cIs that all?\u201d  Since we didn\u2019t even want the nachos and we ordered them just to pacify her, we told her we didn\u2019t want anything else.  She again mentioned that these tables were only for dinner and stormed off.  After this rudeness, we each had our beer and left.",

Probably the best dinner that we have ever had was the chicken tikka masala that we had on Valentine\u2019s Day night. It was perfect. It may have been the best that we have ever had and we have had plenty. I have grown up on Indian food over the years. My wife has grown to love it as well. This is a very very well done version of this meal and anybody who thinks it was too spicy should recognize that that is what you\u2019re getting when you order Indian food and not make comments to try to change management\u2019s idea about how to cook an otherwise perfectly cooked meal. It was splendid.",

It was a busy beautiful Saturday afternoon during the summer so we expected a little wait, but since it was just two of us we got a table right away.  Limited menu but something for everyone.  Service was good, our waitress came over in a decent amount of time, answered questions and took our order.  Our appetizer was off the specials and it was meatballs in a red sauce served hot in a small cast iron skillet with garlic bread.  It was served hot, tasted good and nice presentation.  I ordered nacho's for my meal and my husband had the fish and chips.  Food came out in a decent amount of time and had a good presentation.  My nacho's were okay, but not my favorite by far.  One reason I got them was the description said black olives and jalape\u00f1os which I love.  It had maybe 2 slices of olives and a few jalape\u00f1os, the actual chips were greasy and had little to no taste to them.  Not the worst but definitely nothing I would get again.  My husbands meal was good, the fries seemed under cooked so he hardly ate them.  Most of the food we saw looked good and other people seemed to be enjoying their meals.  The service was decent and our waitress was very nice.  Would think about trying them again, but not any time soon.",

The owners know what they are doing, are genuinely friendly, as are the rest of the staff - who work alongside the owners. Coctails, beer, wine, coffee  and tea, iced or not, soft drinks, great just right suppers,and incredible lovely desserts, all along with wonderful local music, and a warm rustic atmospere.  No pressure to order in a conventional way. Along with all that, the freedom to move around to other tables or the bar, for conversation with friends you may see there, or to be closer to the music.  There is dancing, if you chose to, as well. It does tend to have more customers than seats, and they close early- 11pm? But the minor inconveniences are well worth It!",

Last time half of the food ordered was too cold and we couldn't get the attention of the server all through the meal. And the prices have gone up tremendously. And dont go there when it gets busy as it often is during lunch time especially if you are non-white. They will pass you over for another group in favor of white guests. This happened more than twice. The last time, they didnt bother to check on us and made us pay even by waiting on line with those ordering a take-out while they took pay from next table of white family.
