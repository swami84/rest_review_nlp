With the pick up and delivery options, it was a great opportunity to try their food without waiting in line. Obviously, the food was delicious. I had the stewed lamb which was phenomenal. What really blew me away was their care and attention to detail. When I emailed about ordering for a birthday, they asked for the person's name, and said they would include a card, which was extremely sweet! What was even more special was when I picked up the order, they also included a beautiful bouquet! It was a lovely meal, but the extra effort of including the card and the bouquet was what made it really memorable. Thank you Bad Saint!",

I have, however, came across exactly two dishes that were a bit too salty. I used to eat Kamayan out my palm, but what is cardio? Nonetheless the plates are balanced across texture, sweet, savory, and heart. Come through to the most innovative Filipino restaurant I've had the luxury to come across.",

The restaurant was pleasant, if a little compact. The food was excellent! The slow cooked pork was tender, luscious, richly smoky and benefited from the coconut (milk/water?) it was bathed in. The crisp pork skin was the best icing this cake could have! The crab curry was made from a rich, seafood broth, with plenty of crab meat. Though the flavor of the broth competed with the flavor of the crab a bit, would've loved a more crabby flavor. The bitter melon and egg salad might've been the star of the show! Layers of flavor and texture, with the fragrance of the flash fry in the wok always in the background. The hints of crunchy bitterness in each mouthful were perfectly balanced by the creamy egg and sauteed greens. Be generous with the lemon! Gave them four stars because the food was too expensive. But we were glad we ate there!",

Did the tasting menu and sadly it went from good to barely passable. The amuse bouche was fantastic, however the lobster and pork were overcooked. There was a middle entree in which our party of two was served 1 salad, which at $95 per person feels outrageous, let alone when the drink pairing for the course is just a glass of vermouth.  Which brings me to the drink pairing... I can look past the boring wines (Ontario wine... In a tasting menu pairing???) But the gall to serve a 4oz pour of beer (non limited release maine beer co) or the same pour of cider is borderline criminal.  As someone who sought out, and competed for a seat at bad saint, I feel immensely disappointed In every aspect of my meal and service. I am grateful for the reminder that just because something is Internet popular doesn't mean it's good. I'd recommend you take your money and spend it at one of the many good establishments in the are, like the green zone bar, of  anything from Jose andres",

It's beautifully decorated and comfortable but certainly not for a large group. Onto the food:  Wow! It's very cool to see food from the Philippines elevated to this level. I'm a vegetarian but my partner isn't and we both found hearty, interesting dishes that we could enjoy. The portion sizes are actually bigger than I thought they would be and we took leftovers after getting 4 dishes between 2 people. The radish dish in coconut cream was amazing and so special and it's not to miss. The complimentary dessert was also a nice touch. I really enjoyed my cocktail too which had a coconut vodka-type spirit with some really interesting flavors, and the rye drink reminiscent of a Manhattan was also fantastic.  This is such a great spot for a special meal!",

The dishes were delivered randomly versus working in succession to improve upon the palate. 3.  We were given 4 courses without a single fish or meat...yet there were 3 options on the menu.  We did not request vegetarian and were actually looking forward to the Branzino as the main course when abruptly they brought the dessert. 4.  The food was good but not great...it did not overwhelm the senses. 5.  The service was adequate at best.  No clear explaining of the dishes or the complexity of the ingredients or preparation.

Myself and a partner ordered the Chef's Tasting menu ($65 each for four shared courses + dessert) and after the meal we concluded that not a single item on the menu was near worth the price of entry. The meal consisted of radishes with a coconut paste dipping sauce, an egg-mushroom rice dish, an American-Chinese style vegetable stir fry,  pumpkin stew, and a cornbread cake. We did not finish even half of the main courses (not because the portions were too large, though!). I am writing my first ever restaurant review because of how disappointed I was with the food here. While nothing at Bad Saints was necessarily BAD, hardly any of the meal was enjoyable either. When the tab comes out to $100 per person, however, I expect a lot more than mediocrity especially given the sheer amount of good food options in DC. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because we unwittingly were there while they were experimenting with \"local seasonal produce\" which explained why we were served so much pumpkin and four vegetarian courses.",

        "caption": "I've traveled and eaten food in the Philippines so I was interested in trying bad saint. I read such great reviews but was very mixed about the dish's flavors.  What's good is that service was attentive. They also served a champorado bar which reminded me of real Filipino food. It had bits of crisped rice in it reminiscent of something they do at home to make use of leftover rice. It was served with a little chocolate sauce...and the chocolate was an acceptable quality.  Unfortunately not all the food really tasted Filipino to me.  Read on.  . The labanos was like a crudite. Crisp radish served with a cold smoked coconut cream and toasted pistachios. It was fun and tasty for a vegetable lover.  I only wish they would have made a hot dish (like chicken) with the smoked coconut cream since it's a Filipino dish not typically served in Filipino restaurants in the US.  The kinilaw ( ceviche) was alright. Very hot with all the bits of chili peppers.  A prettier version of what is usually served.  Now, what I didn't like were the pancit (noodles) and the piniritong isda(fried fish) we had. I was surprised because the pancit was well reviewed. In a nutshell, the flavors were not really Filipino.  The pancit was very very sweet. You would never find a sweet noodle dish in the Philippines except for Filipino spaghetti made with banana ketchup and hotdogs . But even this pancit was sweeter than Filipino spaghetti!  The deep fried branzino itself was ok...and eating a whole fish while trying not to choke on bits of fish spine and bone is so Filipino...like eating at someone's home.  But what I didn't like was it was served with a lot of this sauce that tasted like a brown colored vinaigrette with a LOT of knorr seasoning and salt! If you don't know what knorr seasoning is to a Filipino, it's like a bottle of their local Worcestershire sauce but it's made with soy protein and possibly monosodium glutamate. It was so strange ...not really a Filipino thing...to have that sour taste mixed with knorr seasoning.  I thought at first it was a take on Filipino escabeche (deep fried whole fish with sweet and sour sauce)  but this experiment  doesn't work. Please don't believe.that this is a Filipino dish.  We were hoping to be wowed but the main courses we had were a surprising letdown because they really weren't truly Filipino tasting.  Btw, there is no dessert menu fyi.",

Yeah, I could taste the bok choi, and the sesame oil (too much oil in fact), but none of the flavors really stood out the way I expect at a good restaurant. The jumbo crab was better ($40), rich and interesting flavors, but not to die for. Oh, and the complimentary dessert actually made me gag -- some kind of unsweetened chocolate brownie thing that was like eating a lump of lard.

Hopefully you are lucky enough to lock down a table, because it is a very unique and pleasant dining experience. A cozy and unique setting places you at a small table or counter like seating area. Service is quick and offers a limited but creative menu. Every day contains a chef's choice as well, which takes you through a rotation of on and off menu dishes (we went with this). Each dish had something that made it both delicious and different from anything we have ever had(sauce, pepper, style of cooking etc). Everything is shareable plates, and doesn't require any extra seasonings or sauces that they do not provide. Excellent overall experience and worth putting a little extra effort into getting that reservation.",

Maybe I'd have enjoyed it a lot more if I ate seafood - it seems that's their specialty.  We had all four of the vegetarian dishes to share. Two of them were cold salads, and all but one were pretty bitter. The one I liked was very similar to an Indian chaat.  The restaurant is incredibly tiny, with a few tables and bar seating for everyone else. The servers need to be contortionists to get plates in front of people! I liked that actually, it reminded me of small restaurants in Asia. We were right by the door, and the hostess was turning prospective diners away left and right. I won't be going back any time soon, but if you like seafood or meat you'll probably enjoy it a lot more than I did.",

        "caption": "We were finally able to secure a reservation (from someone's cancellation thank you!) after a couple years of conversations of coming to try Bad Saint. Would we come again? Under a different menu, yes totally. Was the dinner as stellar as all the hype? Not really, overhyped a tad, considering we weren't fond of 4 of the 7 dishes we ordered. We wanted to try everything since we were there, so we ordered almost every dish under the meat/seafood section! Verdict on the dishes: - Octopus & Purple Yams: this was the first dish that hit our table and we were so impressed with the burst of flavors. There was just the right amount of lime, coconut milk, spice - we all just wanted to drink the sauce! - Labanos (radish + burnt coconut cream and pistachios): this was so delicious, the cream and pistachios created such a wonderful sweet flavor which was cut into nicely with the radish flavor. - Rellenong Alimasag (crab): came with gluten sticks for dipping, this was both delicious and rich; had us wanting more! - Prawns with Tomato & Chile: the flowers here were so dainty! Prawns were grilled well, juicy and tender. The sauce had a very nice kick to it. - Off menu Eggplant + Tofu: dish tasted good, but was very \"Chinese take-out tossed in the wok\" flavors. Pricey too for what you get. - Chicken Dish: we ordered this as an extra because we were all still hungry and figured we would try everything. Dish came out with a soup and sate sauce. Soup was rich and flavorful, loved the bittermelon in it. The chicken was really just a Chinese-style ginger scallion \"bai zhan ji\". There weren't any creative takes on it - we could have had without this dish. - Lechon: we were extremely extremely excited about this dish to be disappointed. There must have been too much smoke in the dish or something, but the meat and skin especially, all tasted very chemical. The guys at my table ended up eating it all anyway since they were hungry, but I spit mine out unable to stomach the taste. Unfortunate. Service was great - our plates/utensils were replenished consistently and our server was knowledgeable on the menu. The restaurant gives you some chocolate covered bananas with your check to finish off the meal, but I would have loved to have a dessert. If there was a dessert menu we would have ordered everything to try it out. Please add some in the future!",

You will have no prob booking a spot.  My friend and I got the bitter melon dish, lechon, and lump crab in butter garlic. They were all delicious. The crab was amazing, lechon is a must, bitter melon was maybe an acquired taste. I wouldn't get that again but it was good. Three dishes was enough for us and it was topped off by a chocolate covered sliced of banana, a perfect bite of dessert.  It's worth it, but for someone like me, only once in a while or maybe only once. It's expensive. I'm more of a fast casual eater, so I would go back if a foodie friend came to town and wanted to try it. Otherwise I'll just go to Manila Oriental with my Mom.",

The 4 star is based on the food feeling one note at times, and not like completely composed dishes. The crab was really good, but felt like it was missing a vegetal or herbal component. The pork was similar, although they included a few pickled veggies (but not enough). By the end of the meal, the Ifugao salad was the only outstanding dish we had. The rest were good, well executed, but felt incomplete. The bitter melon felt like it needed a hint of sweet to balance the more sour notes.

Next had crab with butter and garlic which was inedible. Drenched in butter and oil and way too salty. Also served with over fried donuts???? Don't know who's idea that was. Last thing was fried squid, which was mostly fried rice dough. Barely any squid. Disgusting. Honestly shocked because this place had such good reviews. Will never return ever again.",

I'd rather go to Purple Patch, the Filipino restaurant in Mount Pleasant, for good Filipino food and cocktails at a cheaper price in a more comfortable setting.

We were fortunate to get a reservation for this extended event. Normally, one has to line up at 3:00 - 4:00 pm to get a seat at this cozy spot that seats about 24 guests. The menu included an assortment of dishes including black bass sinigang, a lobster rice tamale, lechon (of course), and Filipino spaghetti to name a few. With a rotating menu, we're always excited to see what Tom comes up with. He brings the comfort of home and his creativity and passion for cooking into each of his dishes with all the textures and flavors in every bite. If you are able to catch the window of opportunity to book a seat for one of their special events, do check it out. It was a nice perk to skip the line with all the snow, but even if you can't, Bad Saint is ALWAYS worth the wait!",

It is so small, that it's actually really hard to make any movement inside the restaurant. The tables are ridiculously place, so there is no chance for you to socialize. I ordered an oxtail, and they literally put some beef spam on top of a naked bone, so I actually paid $35 for a can of spam! You are not going to feel like you are in the authentic Filipino restaurant. The music are westernized, no Filipino design at all, even the dishes (6 of those in total, used to be 7) don't taste unique.",

I ordered a pancit dish and was served a dish with fettuccini noodles. I asked our server why the restaurant didn't use actual pancit noodles and was told that the chef preferred to serve a different type of noodle that was made in house. By taste alone I can tell you that the fettuccini noodles were barely distinguishable from store-bought. My boyfriend ordered a poke dish and was provided a very small bowl holding maybe 3oz of cubed tuna (and for sure, not a bit more). He was baffled by the small quantity (for the price) and the general lack of flavor.  Please note, all of these dishes are extremely pricy for what is offered, and did not stick out with genuine filipino flavors. Please don't waste your time and money here. Especially when there are so many amazing restaurants in the D.C. area.",

I recommend getting a drink at Wonderland or El Chucho while you wait for your table. The menu is always changing but believe me when I say it is some of the most unique and delicious dishes you'll ever taste. I didn't think it was possible to elevate Filipino food to a level of elegance, but this is exactly that. If you enjoy your meal at Bad Saint, I recommend trying to find a Mom and Pop Filipono run restaurant such as Lumigs and taste the dishes you tried in their original forms. It definitely won't be as decadent as Bad Saint, but you can see how the dishes taste in their indigenous form. I love homecooked Filipino food, but this restaurant really does enrich these dishes without taking away from their original charms and essences. If you don't take this opportunity to try this amazing restaurant, you're really doing yourself a disservice.",

I'd rather just make a reservation, but the food was good enough that I'd definitely go back, line and all. We split the asparagus with brown butter, the prawns with black garlic, and the beef rendang. While we were open to ordering more, that ended up being enough for us. The rendang was both of our favorite - super flavorful and perfectly cooked - but everything was lovely. We were also impressed with the beer offerings. There weren't tons of options, but what they had was delicious and offbeat. Our waiter was slightly quirky but extremely pleasant, and the service was prompt and well-paced.  I've seen at least one review complaining about the seating, which is mostly bar stools facing mirrors. It's a little awkward! But we just laughed about it and mostly looked at the food, and it wasn't a big deal. That said, if you can't sit comfortably on a bar stool, you might want to call ahead to see if they can accommodate you.",

During the two-hour wait I made a friend in line while we each waited for a friend. We ended up eating together in a table of 4, which is the largest Bad Saint offers.  I highly recommend arriving early and getting a larger table to be able to try more dishes. We had 6 dishes among us, and paid $40 each plus tip. Dishes are large enough that you wouldn\u2019t want to be eating them solo.  For a place with such an elegantly short menu, waiters were super accommodating with dietary restrictions and allergies: they helped us with the selections and offered to put items on the side. The staff, all together, are some of the nicest and most helpful people you will meet!  The wait was definitely worth it. I experienced the most pleasant two hours with new friends over lots of flavourful unique dishes \u2014 every single of which I enjoyed. My favorite one was the Bitter Melon stir-fry. Not everyone at the table loved it but if you like bitter and unique bites, I would recommend it. Bad Saint is particularly amazing at making the best sauces to accompany each dish.  Photo credits go to my friend Lee.",

Not only is the restaurant extremely stuffy and excessively warm (we ate on a 98 degree day) but the seating is about as uncomfortable as it comes. Unless you have 3 or 4 you are obliged to sit on a bar stool and stare at your self in a mirror for your entire meal. That aside, I was expecting to override all of that with some splendid food as been hyped for quite some time but was sadly let down on that as much as possible. Out of 5 overpriced dishes the only one that was redeemable was the white asparagus.  There\u2019s very little on the menu that provides a relative description of what your about to it. The lobster dish was just ok, very much like an Indian green curry stew, the soft shell crab was boring, the bitter melon really had nothing to do with melon and was mostly over salted stir fry and the largest disappointment of the evening was the chicken in a pot. More or less it was boiled chicken, skin on which was tough and completely flavorless. Pretty saddened about the entire experience. Save your line waiting!",

The atmosphere was reminiscent of a small neighborhood eatery with a friendly and knowledgable waitstaff. The food was bland and left us wondering how such mediocre dishes created the cult like following of this Columbia Heights eatery. The prawns were undercooked with a heavy soy sauce flavor, the squid ink unnecessary. The kale and lobster dish tasted like a fishy crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e with too much celery, the pork belly an unmemorable salty mush. The closest thing to a highlight was the French morning radish with coconut and pistachio pur\u00e9e. The bottom line was uninspired Filipino comfort food that left us confused as to how such an average restaurant had garnered such attention.",

Food was delicious too. My only issue was our table of four wanting to order everything on the menu and being told by the server that we might have too much food because the dishes aren't \"small plates\". Super refreshing to hear except that our first clam dish came out with 8 little neck clams or 2 clams per person. And a dumpling special with one dumpling per person. All of this would have been fine if the expectation for \"not small plates\" hadn't been set early on. I would totally recommend eating here, just know that plates are small and you shouldn't be dissuaded from ordering everything!",

The staff were generally friendly,  though some were haughty in their explanation of the meal.  The omnivore holiday menu was also uneven at best, with a delicious beef tongue dish and mushroom stir fry and mediocre scallop and salad dish.  The dessert was bland.  The vegetarian menu was slightly better but still uneven and is the only reason I didn't rate my meal lower.  To whom much is given, much is expected.  Having given 2.5 hours of my time in line and 200 plus bucks of my money,  the experience was well below my expectations.  Maybe with the regular menu during the spring or summer will be better.

Service was great (including adding extra portions to an entree to match the number of people in our party), but I felt that asking us to leave just a few (like 5 or 10) minutes after the check was paid was rude and beneath a restaurant that has the reputation that this one does. Cocktails we're fantastic, but some of the appetizers (the bland rice salad) were substandard. All in all a mixed bag. In my opinion some elements were promising, but overall not worth the wait, not worth the hype, not worth the price.",

I have one suggestion that would really make your customers A LOT happier \u2013 improve your seating/hostessing technique.  After waiting in line for hours for the restaurant to open, the last thing you want to do is wait another 45 minutes to talk to the hostess once the doors open at 5:30.  The hostess took a full 4 minutes to seat the first party in line, in a completely empty restaurant, that only has 28 seats and it was only two people.  Can\u2019t quite figure that one out!  Perhaps if you had more than one person acting as host it would be better.  Maybe one host seating people who are ready and another putting the names on the waitlist.  It would really make the line standing less horrible and make for happier customers.  Glad I did it once because the food was delicious, but eating out is about more than the food.  I\u2019ll be back when you take better care of your clients.",

Until now.  We wanted to celebrate my fiance's birthday weekend here. Planned out to come to the place and wait it out for some time. Interestingly we actually met someone waiting in line that had been coming back to this place multiple times, willing to wait just to get a bite of this authentic Filipino cuisine.  The time came up and we got in, Wow, not what I expected for all this hype, not at all. Place has very limited seating.  Host got us to our table and introduced the menu. Of course as we usually go on these food trips we love to indulge on the best they have to offer. So we did.  At the end of this all, we were at awe, the various flavors that they offer from variety of dishes are worth the wait. Seriously, it is.  For all the food lovers out there, if you want to cross that off your list of authentic food flavors, swing by and savor it. Hope this helps!  Karl Cabadin @kcSnapimagery",

We thoughted the Octopus Ceviche.  being the day after Christmas, the lines would be shorter...but no...there are even more people eager to try this restaurant. The line started at 2:30pm for a first seating experience. If you manage the your expectation, and patiently wait...it is so worth the wait and the hype. I laugh at the comments who write not about what is inside...rather than the line. We ordered the Octopus Ceviche, Ampalaya (Bitter Melon Gourd) saut\u00e9ed in egg with black fermented beans, Grilled Bronzino with \"Maggi\", Lime and Vinegar sauce, Kale and Taro leaves saut\u00e9ed in Coconut Milk (Laing), the Clams saut\u00e9ed with Chinese Sausage and Chinese Donut crullers, and Pancit Molo saut\u00e9ed with crispy garlic and shallots, onions and stuff. Dessert was a collection of miniature apple fritters wrapped in egg roll wrappers with cinnamon. What a treat! What a menu! Chef Tom Cunanan, please bring back your Signature Ukoy. But the menu, service, experiencewas beyond our expectations. Diner must order the amount equivalent to the number of people in the group...at least or more. We are already planning our return! For the naysayers that complain, please just go somewhere else and stop taking valuable space! Better for the fans! I cannot wait for the next menu!",

I had the pleasure of visiting here while Tom Cunanan was in the kitchen and he didn't disappoint. We ordered 3 dishes (plenty of food for 2) and each one was unique and delicious. My favorite was the arroz Caldo, followed closely by the tocino dish. What surprised me most was, despite putting a fancy spin on these very traditional Filipino dishes, a lot of the flavors reminded me so much of my dad's cooking. The quality of the meal is much higher, but the underlying taste still reminded me of home, which is something I hadn't experienced at any other Filipino restaurant.  Now the real test is going to be the lumpia dish, so I hope he's serving that next time I go!",

I first visited Bad Saint in April 2016, when I was in DC for a conference, and discovered the amazing food, drinks and people of this treasure. The dishes ranges from petite to enormous, with a fantastic array of flavors & textures, and drinks to match, in a handsome setting (but not spacious: best for 1 to 4 people). I have a more-than-passing familiarity with Filipino food, and these chefs are inventive, restless, and really exciting. Don't expect the same menu the next time you come back; it will be different. If an item looks like you cannot pass it up (& there will be several), eat it right now! Aside from being skillful & stylish, the staff at Bad Saint is incredibly warm. I came back after 4+ months and all of them remembered me. That may be because I sat at the solo seat at the counter, facing into the kitchen: a ringside seat for taking your tastebuds to the circus. Things I have had here range from a rich lemongrass goat curry, to fantastic kinilaws (one involved mackerel, pomelo, radishes & coconut cream; another was tiger prawns, papaya & cucumber with chilis & lime), to a ginisang with bitter melon, scrambled egg, fermented black beans & tomato, and a super-crispy ukoy the size of the crown of England. The line outside Bad Saint may be long for a while now, since Bon Appetit just dubbed them the 2d best new restaurant in America, but if you want to skip the line, go solo & sit at the counter. Tell them I sent you.",

They don't take reservations so we spent 45 minutes standing in line before they opened.  We were just short of first seating and told it would be an additional hour 45 minutes for a table.  After waiting that out at a bar nearby we found the table very crowded, with the guy behind me and I apologizing for knocking into each other many times each.  The ladies I was with were told that they couldn't come in with the few sunflower seeds they had in their hands because \"no outside food or drink is allowed\".  I decided to zero out the tip at that point, though I later relented.  From there it was just a pretentious take on Filipino classics.  Everything was tasty, though the chef seems overly fond of ginger.  The three Filipinas I was with were all unimpressed.",

The restaurant is right next to Room 11 in a small space that fits around 26 or so. It's small and most of the tables are along walls, but it works without making you feel crowded. The restaurant itself looks like a top NYC restaurant.  The food and drinks are out of this world! We ordered the mango salad, pork belly, shrimp fritters, and beef/pork spring rolls. Each dish came out perfectly presented, full of flavor, and amazing. There wasn't a thing we didn't like. Also, get the one dessert they have. I LOVE chocolate and have a bad attitude toward non-chocolate dessert, but this dessert rivals even Swiss chocolate. It's purple rice, coconut milk, plums, and peaches, which sounds disgusting, but it's OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The service is impeccable. Everyone we met, was genuinely nice and smooth.

They were quoting a 2 hour wait, but as we were about to call it quits, the hostess grabbed us stating that two people had cancelled. There are only 25 seats total in the entire restaurant so it is very small. But it's very cozy and the ambiance is inviting. Even though the space is small, the d\u00e9cor and design is hip and modern, with staff members' family pictures and Filipino arts and crafts. Even the bathroom walls are decorated with Filipino punkzines. Pinoy punk is heard in the background.  Nick Pimentel and Genevieve Villamora of Room 11, along with chef Tom Cunanan from Ardeo + Bardeo, have created a restaurant dedicated to Filipino staples and regional food. The menu will rotate on a seasonal basis, and they've already changed their menu despite being open for a mere 3 weeks. The menu breaks down into 3 categories - Gulay (veggies and salads), Isda At Iba Pa (fish and more), and Carne (meat). My recommendation is to try something from every category. Also, order more! My boyfriend and I originally ordered 3 plates but quickly realized that these plates are fairly nouveau-sized so we asked for our menus back to order more.  +Ginisang Ampalaya {bitter melon, farm egg, preserved black beans}: $9 +Kinilaw {tuna, avocado, chilies}: $12 +Ginisang Tulya {littleneck clams, Chinese sausage, Sichuan chile}: $18 +Inihaw Na Liempo {pork belly, acharra, tamarind sauce}: $14 +Tapa {dried beef, farm egg, green salad}: $16  We started off with Kinilaw, which was essentially tuna ceviche. Wonderful starter, not too heavy and great flavor with the chilies and avocado sauce. Next came the Inihaw Na Liempo. This was a delicious pork belly dish marinated in tamarind sauce and garnished with acharra. You eat them as a wrap and the pork belly is fantastic. Then, we had the Ginisang Tulya. The clams were tasty and we devoured the rest of the sauce with our rice, of which they were not hesitant to give us more.  The Tapa is very, very good. I loved the farm egg and the mixture of flavors with the rice, salad, and dried beef. Finally, the Ginisang Ampalaya. If you're not a fan of bitter melon, this dish may be a little hard to swallow but they did a nice job of toning down the bitterness with the other ingredients. It's also a very healthy dish since bitter melon is chock full of nutrients.  Overall, great food and wonderful service. A little pricier given their small plates but very unique cuisine. Their limited space is great for dates or small groups (3-4) of friends but does not cater towards a larger group.",

We had lumpiang, tapa, and pancit.  The lumpiang and tapa were outstanding.  The lumpiang was a crispy well portioned appetizer served with a delicious chili vinegar sauce.  The beef in the tapa was flavorful and crispy and the rice was cooked perfectly. Although I could have done without the cilantro, it was easily moved.  The pancit unfortunately came off slightly flat to me -- I wish they served it with calamansi to boost the flavor. Regardless the menu changes daily so every day offers a fresh new experience.  Be aware that Bad Saint is small and tightly packed, offering 2 wall benches that seat ~5 across and a couple booths that fit 4, you won't be having a large party eat here.  The music and service is excellent and the decor is folksy (but in a good way).  To sum it up, the overall the experience is like eating at your best friends moms house... Very homey feel good food and atmosphere.",
