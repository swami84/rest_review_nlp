Also, they put a crab leg in our soup, and it had no meat in it (it was like a hollow crab leg). We did tell the waitress about it, and she offered up a piece of bread pudding to share, but it was not any good either, and again, not hot (barely lukewarm). Anyways, overall, very unsatisfied (though the waitress was very friendly). She told us the temp of the soup was normal. Anyways, the soup itself tasted very good. It is just too bad there was hardly any meat in it, and that it was not even hot (in the least bit) when she served it to us.",

The steak was cooked to order and delicious. The barbequed shrimp was so good it nearly knocked me over.

I really enjoyed the messy bbq shrimps but the steak was pretty low quality. They give you parmesan butter bread for your meal. They also gave us a free order of spinach and a great desert. Would I go back...nope but I appreciate the efforts made and maybe this might be up someone else's alley.",

Everything was being made fresh to order. Everyone in our party ordered something different, so we all shared bites. I ordered filet mignon, and it was good, but standard. The shrimp and grits were the best we had - better than what we had at Emiril's. They were perfectly creamed and the flavor of the shrimp left your mouth watering. THE RIBEYE. Oh my god, THE RIBEYE. A year later, and it's still the one steak I crave. When I think, \"I'm craving steak,\" I'm actually craving this steak. I had one bite, and ended up eating half of my mom's plate. Perfectly cooked medium-rare. Melted like butter in my mouth. I was full, but I couldn't stop eating it. The gator balls with the roumelade were a memorable dish as well. I cannot wait to go back to New Orleans, just to eat here again.",

My god he was probably the kindest, funniest and sincere waiter I have ever had.  I like to highlight the staff, because they are the life blood of a eatery and will determine your overall experience.  With that said, the food was amazing!  You must try the STAR-TINI and the Cucumber Lemonade.  Upon tasting those drinks you will change your religion.  Alas, the food, yes...the FOOD was exceptional.  My steak was unreal!  The fish dishes were incredible and the garlic-honey sauce concoction was absolutely delish!  Oh, and DO NOT forget to order the bread pudding for desert.  There was a one man band, playing the flute, sax and singing.  An older gentleman, who despite his age played some swanky tunes. The owner was in and checked on us and again it was Assante who made the evening.  What a great introduction to New Orleans!  Thank you.",

I was in the mood for some seafood gumbo and Kelsey does not like seafood so she asked what they had for options. He said they could make her whatever she wanted. One of their burgers caught here eye but then she had a special request because she likes her burgers very smashed and flat. Amir did not bat and eyelash and as he was saying they could do that, his head chef walked by so Amir told him about the unusual request and he seemed happy to do it. The gumbo was best I've had in the NOLA and Kelsey was very happy with the burger. The atmosphere was incredible. They had a live musician playing jazz in the background. I can't even begin to describe how great the experience was. We felt like we were the only ones in there but at the same time were overjoyed every time where heard Amir clanking a spoon on a plate to get everyone's attention to make an announcement of what other patrons were celebrating. One table was celebrating a wedding, one just found out they were pregnant, and we had just got engaged. While in the bathroom Kelsey asked about a desert menu and Amir asked if he could surprise us and she said yes and I'm sure glad she did. He brought out a beautiful plate that had samples bread pudding, cheesecake, and a piece of chocolate cake. The bread pudding was our favorite followed closely by the cheesecake and the chocolate cake. A trip to the NOLA will never happen again without going to Estrella's. I hope if you ever dine in this gem that you have the pleasure of doing so while Amir is present. His hospitality is unmatched.",

We got there at 8:25, it was half empty and they seated us right away. Then we waited. And waited. It took 25 minutes, 2 servers, and 3 tries to get our simple drink order right. I asked for bread after a half an hour, (when we were finally ordering) and server came back and practically threw it on the table. At this point I was disgusted and seriously worried about the quality of the food, so I got up to leave. While I was trying to convince my hubby that we should pay for our \"drinks\" and leave, our food came out. He wasn't happy either, but he was afraid to walk out. He ordered steak and I ordered prime rib, but they both looked the same. His order came out without his baked potato, was told it would be out soon. My potato looked shriveled and brown. I said \"no, nope, and we walked. I would never have done that before (actually, I don't know because I've never had such an awful experience), but I'm too old to put up with poor service AND bad food! Especially in New Orleans!",

When we asked to spilt the check as we had four people dinning she said I can't do that but if we did the math she could enter the amounts?????. The filet was poor a poor cut and way under cooked and the sauce tasted like hormel brown gravy out of a pack and that was on top of the stuffed filet just plain awful and did I mention it cost $46 and only came with one side no salad or soup???? The bread was cheap French bread soaked in some kind of cooking oil and doused in Parmesan cheese and wrapped in bounty paper towels. PLEASE!!!!! Don't make the same mistake we did....

The waitress had a attitude when she found out that a few of my guests were not going to be in attendance do to their jobs and kids. She was on the phone the whole time she served us and I only seen her about 3-4 times. The person who cater to us the most was the busser and treated us with the upmost respect. She sat at the bar on the phone or would leave out and go walk on the phone. My food was not good like it was my prior times going there. When asked to speak to a manager they could not find one because she was out of the restaurant hanging on Decatur drinking. When they finally found her, she came in asked what was the problem and when we stated the problem she became offensive and yelling and screaming at us as if we were nothing. I have worked in the hospitality businesses and never once seen this type of action coming from a person of management. Never in my life have I been to a establishment and was spoken to as if I was a piece of trash. When we became offensive to her and how she spoke to us she stated she was going to call the police on us. All we wanted to do was express our complaints and pay our bill and they took it totally out of control. From the waitress yelling at us to the owners. They were not dealing with children but young professionals who all have paying jobs and work for big companies. For me as the birthday girl to be treated with such disgust I will never go back to that establishment and will never recommend it to anyone.",

        "caption": "Unfortunately, my husband and I were sorely disappointed, to say the very least, with our experience last night at Star Steak and Lobster House. We were in NO celebrating our 41st anniversary, and we were so looking forward to eating there. We have been there before, and the food, martinis, service, and prices were always outstanding; however, last night's dining experience was less than satisfying.  First, the service was very slow.  No one came to our table for a while, and when the waitress did come, the size of the martinis was much smaller than what we had in our previous experiences.  The \"lump\" crabmeat was terrible!!! It appeared to be canned crabmeat, and not only did it taste very strong, but it was also shredded, not lump, was brown, and had a strong aroma.  Neither of us ate it.  The worst part about the experience was that I was fired up about getting the whole Maine lobster, which is their signature dish, but they had \"just sold the last fresh lobster\" before I placed my order. This was at 7:00 on a Friday night!!! We should have left right then, but we have never done that before. I was asked if I wanted two lobster tails, but when I asked if they were frozen, the waitress said YES.  I opted for the filet mignon with the lump crabmeat, very reluctantly. My hushand ordered a filet stuffed with crabmeat and crawfish, which is what he wanted in the first place. The steaks were cooked to perfection, but neither of us ate the seafood for the reason stated above.  The crawfish were tiny--definitely not Louisiana crawfish--and rubbery.The sides of sauteed spinach and asparagus were good.  The good thing in the end was that the waitress brought out a steamed lobster tail alongside my steak at no charge, which was good, and we got two martinis, at no extra charge. We did leave a generous tip to thank the staff for their efforts to please us after all.",

When we asked the waitress SARA about this then she had a major attitude and started yelling \"if you want to give me a $5 tip then I can just give it to the bar tender.\" First of all we were not only giving her a $5 tip we were giving her the remainder of the money for our bill which was $25 for  the additional $22 owed in the folder with the bill. Where I  am from then you leave the tip for the waitress on the table and not with the bill or hand it to the waitress, which is what I was going to do. She was getting real nasty and my husband who likes to prevent conflict encouraged me not to, but I HAD to get back with her because I am not sure who she thought she was talking to us in that manner. I told her she should never be a waitress again and should be fired on the spot because that is no way to provide service and just to assume that the amount we gave for the bill was just her tip (considering we were still sitting at the table and handing her a $20 bill starting the  hand it to her when she started all of this for her tip). I am sorry if other GROUPNERS do not tip, but just because you have one doesn't mean you cant tip. We use GROUPON to try new restaurants that we otherwise would not think of, not to rip off waitresses. Aside from the nasty attitude of SARA who should NEVER waitress again....I can say that the manager and the host who we interacted with were pleasant along with the bartender. The food was pretty good along with the jazz musician for the night who we tipped $50 for his god music. Loved the old New Orleans atmosphere. SARA YOU SHOULD BE FIRED!!! And you need to grow up and never work as a waitress in any restaurant again. This is coming from someone who often tries hard to help others advance their careers and would usually never want someone fired.",

The decor is a bit cheesy and the place is dark like some watering hole, so this doesn't exactly suggest haute cuisine. But, I was positively surprised about the food, even if it was rather simple. First, I was served a loaf of bread, airy and light, topped with butter and parmesan. Then, while not a lobster expert, the lobster was tender and flavorful. The steak was cooked medium as I wanted, but was a bit oversalted. Didn't like the shrimp as much, a bit too strong flavors, although de gustibus non est disputandum. Service was good, the waitress checked me a couple of times and the glass of water was kept full. The price was not cheap, I paid $60. Overall, this is more than you would expect from a bistro, but not there yet if it aims to be a fine restaurant. It would be a good place to go eat some casual dinner.",

My husband ordered bbq gulf shrimp and there was nothing bbq about them. They tasted like plastic and were chewy like rubber.  Neither of us finished our meals. This restaurant is trying to have an upscale appeal but is failing miserably. Cheap silverware, plates and glasses.  It felt a little like eating in a cafeteria. The decor is so cheesy!
