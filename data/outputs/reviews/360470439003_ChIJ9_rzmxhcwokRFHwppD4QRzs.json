I remember trying this place within my first few days of living in the area (pre-COVID); it was a cold snowy day, didn't want to leave and definitely regretted going out when I was out in the snow. But when I arrived, the regret soon melted away. I'm a huge fan of sopes, believe me this was probably one of the best. The masa was so fresh and perfect crisp/soft consistency. Service was attentive and personable but laidback. This place is very unassuming on the outside and easy to miss, but you'll be glad you tried!",

I went there for a late breakfast, and ordered the Mexican hot chocolate and the Huevos Benedictos.  The hot chocolate was good, and they toast the marshmallow at the table, which was cool. The only downside is that between the cup, the amount of hot chocolate, and the whipped cream, there was almost no way for me to easily get the hot chocolate out without spilling a little bit. That then got onto the paper that's between the saucer and the cup, and created an annoying situation where I had to make sure to undue the suction before picking up my cup. Moving on.  The huevos benedictos were great. They make sure to toast the English muffin, which some places neglect to do. Egg was nicely runny. The potatoes and sauces were well done. I was surprised at how full I felt after the meal, and was glad that I hadn't ordered an appetizer or anything else.",

Waitress was very friendly and attentive, she also offered us complementary little pancakes with banana pur\u00e9e which melted in my mouth! Highly recommend to stop by for breakfast if you\u2019re in the area.",
