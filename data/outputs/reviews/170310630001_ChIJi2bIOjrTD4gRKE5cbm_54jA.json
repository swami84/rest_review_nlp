The service was amazing, the younger woman with long braids was so sweet and made sure I got something good. I\u2019d never been there before and was feeling indecisive. The 50/50 combo is so much food for around $13 Beef kabob was really good, chicken shawarma was great, falafels were fresh, crispy, and nice and soft inside. All the vegetables were fresh, the rice was cooked well, and the salad was delicious. I don\u2019t even usually like salad \ud83d\ude02 It was delicious food you could tell was made with care. That\u2019s not an everyday find. The location doesn\u2019t show up on Apple Maps as it\u2019s connected to Philly\u2019s Best next door. It also doesn\u2019t show up on Yelp, which so many people use to find quick food. I think they might get more business if they fix that! I just want this place to exist for as long as possible.

They offered us free drinks and the customer service was great. 10/10 would definitely make this a stop. Quick and great food. Loved it here!!",
