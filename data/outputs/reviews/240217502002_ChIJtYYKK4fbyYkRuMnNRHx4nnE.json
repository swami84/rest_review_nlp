For the main dish we both had the Tonkatsu bowl. The noodles you can tell were very fresh, the soup broth was delicious and full of flavor. The only thing I would say is, however which way they cooked their meat, left it just a little bit dry for my taste.

The noodles were also dry and didn\u2019t taste right. Not sure if they make their own noodles but it was a first for us to not like the noodles in our ramen which is a big deal. So the three most important ingredients for us were a miss. Especially for the price you\u2019re paying for this ramen. This was one of the more expensive places for ramen that we have been to and it definitely does not live up to that price. The Star was for the shiitake mushrooms which had amazing flavor.  Before we go anywhere we always read the comments and were so excited.  We will stick with getting our ramen elsewhere.",
