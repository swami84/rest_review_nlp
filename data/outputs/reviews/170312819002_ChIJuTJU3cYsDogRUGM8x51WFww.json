You forgot to give me my drink and I was annoyed about my debit card not working and having to use my credit card and forgot all about it until I got back to work and realized I was never handed a cup. So I paid 2.99 for a tiny bag of chips. 3. Your service was slow and inefficient. 4. No napkins or spoons provided; hard to eat soup without a spoon. 5. I asked for my sandwich to be lightly toasted. This was NOT lightly toasted.  I am so unimpressed. The only redeeming factor is, the food tasted, ultimately good. However, I do not believe it was worth the $13 I paid for it.  Shame... You are so close to my job. Eating there frequently would have been so convenient.",

Half of the seating area was closed off during the middle of the day, and high top chairs are difficult to access with a bad knee. Staff were more concerned with talking amongst one another than assisting the pile up of customers in the front, and the girl there had an attitude when taking orders. It doesn't help that she was extremely difficult to understand, and was hard of hearing as well. Having visited other locations I know this isn't an issue, but this experience was unacceptable all around.",

He even stopped making my sandwich, while I stood there waiting so he could finish his rant. Then the person at the register apparently didn\u2019t know how to operate it, so she had to get some training from the manager, again while I\u2019m standing there waiting with other customers behind me. My all-wrong sandwich wasn\u2019t even warm after I made it through that cluster... I\u2019m generally pretty patient and forgiving of little things, but this was ridiculous.

You can customize your sandwich by what you tell the employee what you want on your sandwich. Here in lies the rub. This is probably the third time (that I can remember) I've had or heard of various problems. This last time was the last straw for me. It's when an employee argues with you about what you ordered vs what they thought you ordered. I always order the exact same thing so why would I switch it up and say something different? Well I didn't. Here's a tip for all managers, teach your employees to apologize and remake the sandwich. Period. NOT argue with the customer. What's the point of an employee arguing with a customer? There is no point! Remember, if you upset customers they go elsewhere (and there are alot of other places in the area) and they talk and tell their friends of their bad experience. I know it sucks and sometimes as an employee you really just want to tell a customer off but it's not worth it and if the manager is worth anything they will retrain that employee or get rid of them if they can't seem to get it through their head what the service industry is all about. And after hearing another employee at the same potbellys tell a different customer they were wrong I knew it wasn't just me. I will be going somewhere else.",
