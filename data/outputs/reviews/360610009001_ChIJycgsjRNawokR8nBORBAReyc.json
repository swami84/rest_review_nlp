Did not explain or answered our questions even though we were the only ones in the restaurant. We ordered pasta and during the middle of the meal He started asking if we were going to finish soon. The chef was the one who brought us the food and was actually very kind with us, talked to us and made us feel welcomed. But the waiter was a complete disaster. Then when we were going to pay He included the gratuity not as optional and said He could not remove it from the bill. Thanks to the chef, but this things makes me not willing to come back to that restaurant again. Do not recommend.",

Just amazing! Felt like I was in Italy getting the whole experience! The pastas come in great portions and worth taking to go.  The price Is acceptable for the neighborhood & is a totally worth it especially-very fresh ingredients too (I have Italian family so I\u2019m super picky!). Giorgio made sure my farewell dinner with a great friend of mine was perfect! I think I\u2019ll book at the hotel attached next time just so I know I\u2019ll be eating well! (And there were several other diners but  he made us feel like we had it all to ourselves!)  I wasn\u2019t staying at the hotel but my friend was and he said he had the perfect meal before his 3am airport departure. I can only speak for myself...I\u2019ll 10000% be coming back as often as I can when craving Italian. Again thank you so much Gorgio! 10 stars! Can\u2019t wait to try more of his suggestions!

At one point my fianc\u00e9 got up to use the restroom & i guess Gionni heard him ask me if i was going to be okay alone that he stood by my side making sure i was okay til my fianc\u00e9 came back. such a gentleman i swear. He then treated us to a couple of appetizers on the house & educated us on a really yummy organic bottle of wine that i now see myself getting because of him.

The breakfast buffet was quite good and the food on an evening was very good. The service however varied depending on which staff were in and how busy it was. We booked a table for new years eve but when we went in we were made to feel very unwelcome and we were rushed out. That put us off completely and chose to eat at a restaurant down the street the following evening. Some staff hadn't got a clue what they were doing and so service was even comical at times.",

Friends had chicken pesto penne pasta and salmon which were yummy by their review!! Service was excellent; we were hard pressed for time since we had a flight to catch and they were very accommodating and recommended all the dishes and took care of us!! Overall, nothing less than 5 stars!!",

A quaint, authentic italian restaurant located in the double tree hotel in lower manhattan. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive.  They know exactly when to approach the table, and do all the subtle things to ensure you have a wonderful experience.  Our server was Giorgio, and he was AMAZING.  My girlfriend and I came for dinner at the recommendation of my father.  After mentioning to Giorgio that this was our first trip to NYC and telling him my father recommended we stop here, he immediately recalled who he was (for context, my dad comes here 3-4x/yr).  He was extremely personable and chatted with us periodically throughout the evening.  The food was excellent.  Something that I would expect on the table at a Sunday dinner with the family.  Authentic, homemade italian food.   Finished the night with a homemade Sambvca Grappa, and a personal sendoff from the waitstaff.  Would recommend this place to all of my friends and family.",

On the front door there is a menu with some prices, when you ask the menu inside they have different prices with 2 or more dollars higher. The menus doesn't have the price of the drinks so when you are going to pay the bill has some higher values. I personally ask the price of the coke they said 4 dollars. When I receive the bull it was 4.50 dollars. The menu inside the shop says it has an extra fee of 18% (which I think it is totally out of place) but when I received the bill it was calculated as a 25%!! They are scammers",

Main course of cappellini with shrimps, artichokes and cherry tomatoes was well balanced and delicious, generous enough to take some home. Only drawback was that other people like the place too and by the time we left it was packed and the noise level had risen somewhat.",

She never checked on us until it was time for the bill. When we recieved our check, we realized she told us the wrong amount for brunch. She quoted $17 when it was closer to $25. She blamed my partner and I, lied and said she mentioned no price and that we can check the menu...which she never gave us. We later gave a voucher and she became even more irrate.  To be fair, the other servers helped us a great deal. They were kind, professional and attentive.  Stay clear of Bessa, and you should do just fine.",

We overheard him telling to be from Albania and more trying to impress stuff. The food was okay but for sure not spectacular. Arugula salad was below par, the mushrooms and artichoke had hard undercooked bitter tasting pieces. Chicken Marsala was good. Pasta did not taste freshly made and sauce tasted watered down.  When we finally got got waiter\u2019s attention we asked for the bill. It turned out to be less than the voucher we had. So we gave him the voucher which also covered a significant part of the gratuity. He then let us wait for several minutes to add some gratuity. We got fed up and left.  Whilst waiting for the elevator he suddenly jumped on us and telling us we had to give him more. We did not like that behaviour. He then left threatening us to make sure that we would not get any of our incidental credit card hold back from the associated hotel.  My wife left really uncomfortable.  Do NOT threaten me as I will not tolerate that.  The place is aiming for hotel guests and maybe they accept the quality of the food but I\u2019d rather go next door to Irish pub Murphy\u2019s where they serve you better food for a fraction of the price.  If you are after great Italian food, look beyond as Manhattan has numerous places that will offer you real Italian quality food.",

Being that it was extremely convenient being right downstairs from our room. You would think they would have some sort of arraignment with the hotel for room service or would delivery... I mean after all it is in the same building but NO. Not a big deal we ran down and grabbed and rushed back to the room. The food was amazing!!! I loved my cheese ravioli alla vodka. The person taking our order thought I had three heads when I asked for chicken with it, but either way it was delicious!! my girlfriends also loved their entrees too.

To their credit, there was a complimentary plate of a little salumi and parmigiana regianno chunks gratis and they offered a homemade drink with dessert. I would go back.",

        "caption": "Truly excellent experience. I admit that I arrived during an off peak time (2:30 on a Sunday) and I was the only patron, but it was a truly marvelous experience. I am moderately allergic to wheat, but I rarely mention it because it's something I'm good at managing on my own. When I refused the bread, withininutes they'd provided two wonderful options to my table: fried zucchini (not breaded) and a cheese and meat plate. The fact that they did this without my asking revealed an attentiveness that's rare in the industry as a whole.  I ordered one of the appetizer specials, which were sea scallops swimming in a lightly spicy tomato and pepper marinara that exquisite. The scallops we're perfectly cooked and the marinara was a perfect complement. I also ordered the veal marsala (the veal did not look breaded at all). This is my only mark against them. Admittedly, marsala is a difficult thing because everyone has their own opinion. Some prefer sweet, others prefer savory, and some prefer marsala that reveals a stronger alcoholic undertone. My only complaint is that this marsala did none of these things. It was a complete middle of the road experience. So, that was disappointing, but the veal was tender, not overcooked, and there was just the right amount of sauce (it was neither swimming nor dry).  Overall, I had an excellent experience. Perfect service with excellent food. While the marsala wasn't exceptional in any way, it wasn't disappointing and I've had many disappointing experiences with marsala dishes.",

Visiting New York from Italy me and my boyfriend were tired of street food and decided to have a dish of warm pasta on a cold january day. The reviews were really good for this place so we thought we might get something similar to the real thing also because we have heard that many italians in new york cook authentic italian food . Well, nobody in this spot is italian and we noticed that!... but we had already sat down so we ordered one of the simpliest italian dishes. Fettuccine sorrentina, just fresh tomatoes and mozzarella. It was overcooked and just awful. I have tasted better pasta on planes! Who the hell gave these imposters good reviews beats me! This is a digrace not just to italian food but to good food in general ! VERY DISAPPOINTED.",

I went there with my friends last month.  I was told the owner of this restaurant is originally from Naples.  We had a stracciatella soup and crab cakes to start, which wre recommended by the wait staff. The soup was good but I thought $9 was really over priced. The crab cakes were excellent (my friends also loved them).  I love seafoods. So, I ordered the linguini with clam sauce. Unfortunately, by considering the Manhattan price, I was not so impressed for this meal. My friend had a salmon dish and he was very happy about it. I really do not like to write this but I thought they have quality control issues of the consistency of foods there.  I have to say they had Brooklyn quality with Manhattan price.  Personally, I will not recommend this place to my friends.",

Just a bowl of  Pasta Fagioli which was listed on their menu at $10  sounded just right.  As  Pasta Fagioli goes it was mediocre at best and less than exciting.  What is exciting is when you get the bill and find out that you are going to pay them $19.99 for it especially since most of their entrees are in the low 20 range.. When questioned about the discrepancy  I was told that I was given a \"sizeable portion\".  At  the minimum it would have been appropriate  for them to give me a heads up that  they were going to  take it upon themselves to \"Sizeable Portion\" me and the bill.",

Unfortunately the food was just as bad as one would expect from a Doubletree hotel. Wilted salad with commercial dressing, bland pasta with \"pomodorini\" (but only a shred of tomato), overcooked fish with an unripe tomato slice and none of the accompanying vegetables described--and this is just the food.  The waiter treated us like we were completely ignorant (perhaps he thought we were tourists) and spent ten minutes describing \"specials\" that just turned out to be the menu. (We had to ask for a menu, ask to place our order, and ask where the food was--it was 45 minutes before we saw a salad, and this was lunchtime! There are so many staff but it's not clear what any of them are doing.) When the waiter asked (or rather told us) whether we liked the food we could not lie, at which point the owner came out and offered us more food, free wine, dessert and coffee. For this I add one star, but I will never return!",

I would recommend you don't even open the menu, as the list of specials is VERY thorough - but listen carefully and pay attention.

When I read Penne with Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato, and Basil I was expecting a fresh and light dish of Penne tossed with cut fresh tomatoes, Basil leaves in abundance, and chunks of fresh Mozzarella.  It was more like Penne Parmigianna, with chunky tomato sauce, minced basil in the sauce and melted mozzarella  over top.  It's something I don't like and would have never order BUT that is completely my own fault and not a failure of this restaurant!!  The pleasantly unexpected surprise was my random order and the gratis appetizer.  The Panzanela Salad with Gorganzola was absolutely DELICIOUS and completely satisfied my craving for a fresh and light dish!  The included appetizer of zucchini, eggplant, salami, cheese and bread (with spices for some kick and extra flavor) was also perfect.  That reminded me of when I would visit my family in Italy and we were given \"a snack\" to munch on.  Absolutely wonderful.  Next time I will be sure to order a dish that I cant mistaken (or call my order in)!  I have no doubt that it will be delicious.  Grazie ... Ancora ... hahahaha!!",
