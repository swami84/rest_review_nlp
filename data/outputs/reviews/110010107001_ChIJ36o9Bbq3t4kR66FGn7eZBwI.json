If you are huge on fusion style of flavor explosion, this may not be the place for you. This place exceeds more in simplicity and authenticity. Good sushi should not need a lot of flavor embellishments in order to taste good which Kaz Sushi Bistro exemplifies. Do not expect to feel \"full\" unless you plan to spend a lot of money; this is a great place for providing very good food to the \"satiated\" level which is just perfect. As for service, just expect it to be slower on the weekend. Unfortunately, I was just in a hurry to pay my bill. I will definitely come back on a more calm day. Go to Kaz Sushi Bistro with patience and enjoy every morsel. :)",

I was traveling to visit family in DC and heavily researched sushi in advanced and stumped upon Kaz being highly recommended.  The pros: Beautiful atmosphere and building, the inside looked like an upscale restaurant that only DCs finest would frequent. The clientele was of equal status as everyone seemed well off, dressed well, and had good conversations.  The service was also top notch. The servers were friendly, professional, and prompt we barely waited to be sat or even server food.  The cons: The menu was extremely limited. Their entire sushi and sashimi line up fit on 1 page. In Philadelphia we have what feels like an encyclopedia of sushi choices that span every possible combination.  The sushi itself did not taste that great. They put questionable additions to our rolls such as cilantro which I thought was only for tacos. The rolls themselves were so tiny and small that it didnt fill anyone up. The rolls seemed to be half the size of what we were used to. All three members of my party had to order a pizza when we got home because we were not full by any stretch of the imagination.",

I love the cute, compressed paper towel tablets, where the waitstaff will pour some water over to \u201cinflate\u201d so that guests can wipe their hands before their meal. For reference, having moist paper towels is a standard in Japan, so this makes it feel quite authentic. I went for restaurant week, and the sushi arrangement was awesome and delicious. The fish was fresh, and the side dishes were too.  The only qualm I have is with those strange rectangular nigiri options (see photo) with vegetables and other uncommon ingredients. Although they look very cute, they would fall apart when you try to pick it up and I wasn\u2019t very impressed with the flavor combination.",

You have the option to have their pre-selected menus for a set price at the table, or partake in their a la carte omakase experience at the sushi bar. We opted for the sushi bar, and it was incredible. One sushi chef was dedicated to just us, fixing plate after plate of beautiful and fresh sashimi, nigiri, and assorted small dishes. For each round, he recommended how to eat each item (no soy, with hands, etc etc). He was very nice, and the entire experience was phenomenal. He requested that we let him know when we are content, but still have room for dessert. He finished out our meal with a lovely green tea cheese cake, and raspberry Jello cake filled with chocolate. Everything tasted delicious, and was beautifully plated. The price is higher than some other sushi restaurants, but the quality is also far better. The portions were generous, with large pieces of fish, and the rice was perfectly soft.  If we go back to DC, we will definitely be coming here again.",

I wanted sashimi, so the waiter recommend a dish that had a variety of fresh filets presented atop a bed of lightly seasoned white sticky rice. It was an attractive presentation,  the sashimi was fresh,  well cut, and served at the proper temperature, and the meal was delicious.  It came with miso soup that my colleague found a little salty,  but I like salt, so it was perfect for me. Will definitely go back.",

This time it was even more incredible than the first. The service was perfect, not rushed and she even chatted with my guests! She hand a good answer for every question and my buddy chose Chefs Sushi 009, while my other friend decided to try the different cuts of fish! I have to admit, the Toro brought back good memories of Japan when I had Toro for the first time. When you hear it melts in your mouth that's exactly what people mean when eating good cuts of fish. The Sake was smooth with a sweet finish everyone was impressed with the suggestion of our wait person! She knows her Sake! Desert was incredible! Matcha tiramisu, not too sweet but just the right amount of flavor to make your heart sing! We ended the meal with hot tea that brought a comforting conversation that lasted longer than we anticipated. My trip back the Kaz Sushi Bistro was worth it!",

She raved about your place and said that the sushi was amazing as well. I only had one afternoon left in the city so I went and found out that you only have Okinomiyaki on your dinner menu. I explained to my nice waitress how I haven't had that dish in years and asked her to ask the chef to make an exception and make one for lunch. She was hesitant, but asked, and he said yes. That really made my whole day. I was so happy. It was delicious and so was the sushi. She kept checking on me to see how I enjoyed my meal and we chatted about Japan a little. Thank you so much! I will be back next time I am in DC.",

Some people may like that kind of service but I was able to have a very pleasant dinner with my friend. The food is amazingly fresh. Having lived in Tokyo and Kyoto, I have very high expectations when it comes to Japanese food but the quality of the food blew my friend and I away.

So most of the time instead of ordering something like salmon or tuna nigiri, they'll have those items but will recommend them with some weird allmond stuff mixed in. If you're looking for a trustee tasty and reasonably priced place, this is not the place for you. Also their servings were small. This might be the place for some people but it's definitely not for me. I will never be going back because of the mediocre quality, small portions, and extremely high prices",

We were nicely greeted at the door and escorted immediately to the table. My sister, who is disabled, was assisted. Everyone liked the small wash cloth which expanded - we even joked with my brother to get him to try to eat it! Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. She suggested a few different sushi options that were very good - seared salmon was delicious. We liked the interactive nature of the meal. Even though we did not opt for omakase, we ordered twice to try new things. All of the sushi and bento box was excellent. Enjoyed tasting inventive new desserts. The bathroom was very clean. Keep up the good work!",

We enjoyed bento boxes that included a seaweed salad with Japanese kewpie mayonnaise, grilled calamari, and a flan that was served in a very flat dish that was all about the caramelized texture on top. It was one of the best lunches we have ever had in DC. Please know how very appreciative we are of the excellent quality of the cuisine and service at Kaz Sushi Bistro. Simply delicious!",
