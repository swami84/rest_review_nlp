The staff was good but food was no more than just ok. Serving portions was much smaller than other places and the quality was not good enough.  Naan was burned and dry (i can vouch that Haldiram's frozen garlic naans are significantly better). Given this, the prices were at par with other awesome places. Overall it was a disappointment and wont go there again. I noticed most other reviews as well as the presence were not from people from indian origin who may be less aware of the authentic indian food.",
