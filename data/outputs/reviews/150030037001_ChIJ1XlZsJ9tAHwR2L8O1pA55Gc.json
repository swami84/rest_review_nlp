I consider that a disappointment as katsu is best freshly made and hot. Having said that...their tonkatsu is AWESOME! I can't believe how good and flaky this thing is! If I had to compare it I would say it compares to Tonkatsu Tamafuji. Is it as good? NO. But it gets closer than just about any other katsu place I've tried all for a relatively cheap price for the quality you get. The bento is $15 and for an extra 10 you get double the tonkatsu.  The bento comes with ground sesame seeds, katsu sauce, potato salad, cooked edamame, piece of kombucha and really good quality rice with an ume.  I have heard that they can and do run out but you can order online so that's probably the way to go.",

I have bookmarked this place for quite some time and been curious to try their multi-layer tonkatsu since Kimukatsu in Honolulu closed. It did not disappoint.  Juicy tonkatsu with right amount of seasoning and great panko.  Side dishes were simple yet delicious too.  Kabocha and Hijime were yummy, great pick of rice too, very moist and fluffy.   It bothers me a lot when restaurants picked wrong crop of rice which did not happen here.  I was able to obtain one last bento box with last minute walk-in, thanks for workers there!  I will def. make reservation next time when I am in town.  Tip - eat their bento box ASAP as dine in is no longer possible here.",
