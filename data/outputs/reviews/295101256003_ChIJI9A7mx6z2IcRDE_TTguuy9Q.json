Since I work during the week, I have not gotten a chance to give it a try. This morning on a walk before work, I decided to make an impromptu stop since I saw the menu on the window features Hot Cakes. As y'all know, I am all about pancakes. The waitress was very friendly, and I was seated promptly. I immediately ordered the full stack (3) of Hot Cakes. The Hot Cakes came out quickly, which was fantastic. Why? Because these Hot Cakes were excellent. They were light and fluffy and had great flavor. For only $4.50, the portion size was quite generous, and this meal was a total bargain. The syrup was also good, and it complemented the Hot Cakes well. The diner vibe of Chili Mac's was obvious, and I hope to come back in the future to give these another try. I am really glad that I checked it out! My advice: Check it out!",

There are three wonderful waitresses, coffee pot in hand, always on the ball, and calling you \u201cHun.\u201d I order\u2014for a total of $8\u2013eggs over easy, bacon, toast, hash browns, and a half order of biscuits and gravy. This is THE greasy spoon that all St. Louisans need to experience. The menu is frank, straightforward, and honest. The bottom line could not be clearer: you walk in, order your favorite first meal of the day, you pay a small amount (and please tip generously), and you\u2019re on your way. As you walk away, looking at the tacky 80s architecture of 1 Metro Square in the background, you will realize this establishment has captured an iconic piece of Americana that you can never let go. Visit Chili Macs as often as you can\u2014like a fine wine, it never goes bad, and only gets better with age.",

It's new york style seating meaning you will sit at a table with random strangers, the place is incredibly small.  A bar, 10 tables with 2 grills and a frier running.  What really makes this place great is the extremely nice waitresses, they greet you when you walk in the door, and through out the whole time they are constantly checking in on you as if you are their own son or daughter, normally I would see this as annoying but not here, not in this type of atmosphere. They will come put a hand on your shoulder and it feels very comforting during lunch on a stressful workday downtown.  It's honestly like Mom serving you lunch.  They even remember most people's lunch orders when they walk in which makes you feel valued. The prices are cheaper than big establishments in the area. The owner who runs the cash register makes it a point to ask how your day is going and the little things like that or a simple rub on the back from the waitresses is what makes this place my new favorite in st. louis.  I'm a regular now and go every week.  5 star rating.",

I requested one item - then, instead of asking if that was it or if there was anything else, or even making eye contact, she moved on.  The food itself was ok, just ok. Potatoes were good, tamale was dry, probably because of the microwave. Coffee was alright. Can't deny that it's cheap, very cheap, but you get what you pay for here. I kind of regret going. Place is dingy, not a classic diner in my understanding. Just a dated place that relies on quantity instead of quality.",
