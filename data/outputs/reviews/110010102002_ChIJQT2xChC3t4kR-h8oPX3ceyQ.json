We got there and the waiter never even introduced himself, I told the waiter it was my bf\u2019s birthday, and asked if we could get some plates for the cake that I brought, he said \u201csure! No problem!\u201d So my bestie and I walk outside, smoke a cig, put candles in the cake, walked back inside, got to the table, lit the candles and started singing! It was awesome, check the pic! Then, what I assume was some kinda manager, informed us that we couldn\u2019t eat the cake in the restaurant. We had a $400 tab... $400 dollars! There was literally 2 other parties near us, one was 3 adults and a baby, the other was a couple outside. I know it\u2019s a little silly to get upset that they completely rained on our parade; we asked ahead about  the cake and then get \u201cscolded\u201d and quite frankly I was embarrassed, after dropping $400 on subpar food and drinks, at the very least I thought we could sing happy birthday   and eat a slice of cake. Or perhaps they could have comped a round of drinks? I don\u2019t know, they left a bad taste in my mouth...",

We have been coming to the Wharf for years and this spot exceeded our expectations. I appreciated that their crab cake was mostly crab and not breading/fillers like many other restaurants.

The shrimp was also heavily seasoned. Those things are okay and i still would have given the place five stars, as we enjoyed the ambience and music. What we didn't like was that our server seemed to pay attention to us less and more so to tables around us. From the time that he dropped off the food until we were checked on and then ordered dessert was at least 25 minutes. However,  he checked on the 4 person table in front of us 4 times and the couple behind us 3 times. We were in the same area however we were checked on less. Im not saying it was a racial thing but we were definitely not enthused with the service. I feel that an annoyingly attentive waiter is better than someone who picks and chooses who to joke and laugh with and who to pass by. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I probably won't come back.",

        "caption": "Service: We came here on a Saturday night excited for seafood. We arrived at 9:20pm and the more experienced hostess informed us that there would be a 20 minute wait or less and would text as soon as a table opened. My boyfriend asked if she would prefer us wait nearby or if we were able to walk around the waterfront. She reassuringly told us that walking around wouldn't be a problem. 30 minutes in, we came back to check if something opened up thinking that a table would be opened soon. We stood across from the restaurant waiting and saw a couple arrive and immediately get seated. Confused, my boyfriend asked the hostess if something was mixed up or if they arrived before us since its been well past 20 mins. She looked up with an annoyed look and asked \"Are you sure you were on the waiting list? Because I don't see anything\". My boyfriend pulled out his phone and showed her the wait list confirmation that was sent at 9:20pm. She rolled her eyes and told us that \"According to her list, our confirmation was canceled by us at 9:39pm\" When we showed her the screen, she saw that clearly that did not happen. With a clear look on her face she then said, \"Well i can look and see\".  Food: When we finally got seated, we decided to order one of each of the oysters and clams, the scallop carpaccio, the fry oyster basket, and the grilled squid. The oysters and clams were delicious and the scallop carpaccio was one of the best. The fry oyster basket was decent and the grilled squid was fine. For dessert we had the banana pudding, which was excellent.  Overall the food was pretty good, but not amazing enough to justify waiting unnecessarily long, rolled eyes, and undeserved attitude when we were more than happy to understand that mistakes happen.",

I know customer service, I live and breath customer service, if you do not like ALL people, or pressure, don't get into a high pressure job where people are around.  It takes more than making drinks to be a good bartender/host, you have to have a personality that accepts ALL people. Thanking the manager again, the second manager, who had to ring us out because the bartender pretty much ignored us after we'd asked too many questions, the first manager we met was just as short and rude as short as the bartender.",

There were 4 of us, and they seated us at an odd bar-style table jutting out of the oyster bar - it was not conducive for conversations at all. The oysters and scallop carpaccio we ordered for an app were very delicious and fresh. The chowder here is also delicious as it has a kick, and is different from your typical chowder. The rest of our food was extremely subpar and inconsistent. The shrimp was just ok - several of my shrimp's textures were a bit mushy, meaning the shrimp wasn't fresh. The crabcake sandwich was extremely underwhelming. We really liked the fries that came with the crabcake sandwich were very good and crispy so we ordered another side order. The side order that came, the fries were soggy and stuck together - we had to order another one. We also ordered a side salad - portion was generous here. On top of the food, service was also very subpar. The hosts are quite curt, especially when you go back to check in on wait status. Our server looked like she hated her job - she never smiled, she didn't laugh when we tried to make jokes, and didn't apologize when our fries had to be replaced. Not sure we would come back here.",
