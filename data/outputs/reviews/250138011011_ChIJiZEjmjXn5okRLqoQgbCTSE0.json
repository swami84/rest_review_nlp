I know that certain chefs don't like to change the recipe, claiming that it can't be called the same dish, but if that's the case I think it shouldn't be advertised on the menu as a possible vegan one.",

        "caption": "UPDATE/REPLY TO OWNER'S RESPONSE: Thank you for your answer. I intend to clarify that there is no confusion in my statement. I actually visited your restaurant again recently (after the original review) because I do love the flavor and freshness of the food that you serve. I was attended by a waitress and a waiter.  The waitress was very kind and attentive; the waiter took the order. I ordered my entr\u00e9e and specified it to be vegan. I explored the menu several times and, even though it does explain which items are \"vegan\" (or can be made vegan) with a \"V\", there is no explanation of the rice not being vegan. The entr\u00e9e that I ordered comes with a side of rice. Again, I asked for it to be made vegan and was not informed that the rice contained milk. I eventually ordered a side of roti bread to compliment my meal. If you serve a side of rice that contains dairy with a dish that is identified as vegan and are not specifying in the menu nor by verbal prompting that it contains dairy, you are creating confusion and are irresponsibly serving food.  I worked as a busser, waiter, and eventually supervisor/manager in the restaurant industry (both local and chain-owned restaurants) for 11 years and am well aware of the sensibility of managing food allergies and dietary restrictions. This restaurant is not properly managing this at all (at least during my three years visiting twice per month), even though the owner's response states the contrary. Only once has a waiter in this restaurant has specified that the rice contains milk at the moment of ordering; and this was when I found out I had been consuming dairy without my consent, three years after asking for the food to be made vegan and being served food containing dairy without any kind clarification or prompting.  Accepting your mistakes and acting upon them helps you improve and evolve, as well as retaining and gaining clients. It is disappointing to know that no effective action has been taken to amend this situation, considering that it can be deadly for some people that are extremely allergic to dairy. It is also unfair and disrespectful to people who follow a spiritual/ethical path that have chosen to not consume animal products. I sincerely hope the administration of this restaurant becomes more diligent in solving this issue and integrates options that are truly and honestly vegan. Otherwise, offering vegan options is not an option for you. _____________ ORIGINAL/FIRST REVIEW:  *VEGAN AND DAIRY ALLERGIC PEOPLE: BEWARE!!!*  I've been to this restaurant many times during the past three years and they indeed serve delicious food and their service is great. The servers are kind and very attentive. However, it seems that most of them were not well trained or are not informed of critical aspects of dining and the culinary world such as dietary restrictions and allergens. I follow a vegan way of life and enjoyed that the restaurant had multiple options on their menu listed as vegan.  After three years of visiting around twice per month, a server recently told me \"you cannot order this plate vegan\" even though it was labeled as vegan on the menu. I asked him why, if I had ordered it for almost three years and they always told me it was vegan. He mentioned that the rice that comes as a complimentary side with all dishes is made with milk and has always been made this way in the restaurant, therefore not vegan.  I was disappointed to know that, not only the options they list as vegan are not actually vegan, but people that are allergic to dairy can have a dangerous and life-threatening experience eating these options. I also felt somehow uneased knowing that I had consumed a food item that is not aligned with my spiritual beliefs, without my consent.  I have asked on several occasions afterwards if they are able to change the rice for a vegan option and they respond that they are not, even though they continue mentioning in their menu that these options are vegan. If you are allergic to dairy, are vegan, or follow a spiritual practice that does not consume dairy... BEWARE!",

We reached one hour before the closing time , we were informed since we are looking for \"table \"  they could not service us . We wasted 30 min just to find this place since we were coming from Vermont and coming to this place added  time and energy which was wasted . If they don't service dining in service to customers after 8:45 I suggest they update their timings and don't give customers false information which results in wasted time and energy  .  Or if you give only takeouts after 8:45 then that information should be updated rather than giving incomplete information . Just on this note wether the restaurant ratings is good it doesn't matter if firstly even reaching before 60 min prior closing time you're rudely informed by the staff that they could not service you . My suggestion to the future customers call this restaurant before and ask if they are open because god knows that they could refuse you food even if you come two hours before closing time .",

Located a convenient half block from the new station parking garage, at the intersection of Lyman and Main Streets, this intimate restaurant offers great service, d\u00e9cor, and food. On two previous occasions, we got carryout, once when we took an Amtrak train bound for Hartford for a day trip along the newly opened Hartford Commuter Line (Springfield \u2013 New Haven) and once after coming from Washington, DC, on the daily Amtrak Vermonter. On this occasion we had a normal lunch meal at a table. We each had a different, and equally delicious, lamb dish and a different type of lassi drink, one \u201cmango\u201d and one \u201csweet\u201d, both mouth watering. We also had two types of bread: naan and gluten-free, lentil. Finally, we each had a separate type of soup, one coconut and one lentil, both very tasty.",

Will say the Indian beer for a non beer drinker and for beer snobs will be pleased with the Indian beer and its smoothness and taste - a pint bottle was intimidating at first but was a pleasant companion through out the journey. The appetizers was marvelous, the pizza( small enough to have an appetizer for two) was the highlight while the shredded lamb and peas in a crust was alright and the vegetable fried balls were good. That is where it ended the enjoyment of the meal. The entree reminded me why it had been 8 years since I have been back. The shrimp in sauce left me wanting to go and season it myself as it lack anything exciting. The chicken was dry and the rice flavorless...wait my memory is coming back around the savior of the entree was the naan with coconut in the middle. Lovely combination. Desert was not worth saving room for - I would go back to try something else only after another 8 years.",

Best Indian food I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve been to India!!! The server, Shannon, recommended a meal to me that samples a wide verity of different dishes. I am currently so over stuffed I\u2019m about to pop..... I literally couldn\u2019t stop eating. I couldn\u2019t even fit dessert, and I\u2019m fat. I mean I am really really fat, I always have ice cream or cake after every meal but I just had no room left. Thank you Shannon and Panjabi Tadka!",

They don't tell you that the rice pudding is made with milk, which I cannot eat for the same reasons. The chai tea is disgusting. The salad with the lemon dressing had no taste and was full of lettuce which had turned color. The cucumber and tomato in it tasted bad. I ordered medium spicy lamb as sometimes mild has no flavor, as has been my experience with many restaurants, not only Indian. If this is medium, I don't wonder how the hot is! I've never had such bad Indian food in my life. Very disappointed. I want a refund.",
