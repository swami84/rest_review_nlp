The yakitori was better than what many places serve, but I\u2019ve had better from street vendors in Japan. The wagyu fried rice is good, if a bit salty, but not what one expects for the price/portion. It may be enjoyable if one is eating in (especially for drinkers), but the takeout wasn\u2019t worth a drive into the city. I\u2019m glad I waited to try this after a celebration dinner instead of for the day of celebration\u2014it just wasn\u2019t worth what I paid. It\u2019s not bad at all, it\u2019s just not fantastic either.",

The sashimi was so fresh and was such a good value for how much you got! We also got the T.T. Roll which was really good and has a nice kick to it! We also got the tako yaki and the maze soba. Everything was amazing. The noodles in the soba were cooked perfectly! I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!!",

TenGoku offers extremely delicious, well priced (for the neighborhood...half price of Momotaro) food and drink.  This is the neighborhood Japanese spot. Come here after a fun night, or for some Sake, Japanese beer, and great salty dishes. Drink, eat, and be happy.  Service is personal and genuine. What Wishbone is to Southern cooking, and JTap is to the local football bar, Tengoku is a unique opportunity to be transported back to a classic Izakaya in Japan.  The star here is the Kushiyaki. Negima is our favorite, but everything is delicious and flavorful. Also none of this BS wagyu from Australia. This is the Japanese Beef. Excellent flavor both in the Kushiyaki and the fried rice!  We've been back two weeks in a row...and will likely be back for weeks to come.",
