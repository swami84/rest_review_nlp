We ordered drinks and food. The drinks arrived pretty quickly. However, the food took so long to arrive (50 minutes). When it finally arrived we were so happy until we began to eat. The entire plate was cold. Not just mine but all three with different food items and they were cold. They took away the food and said the would redo and bring over when it was ready. The second plates arrived and guess what, this was cold too! This ruined the entire celebration and I will never visit this business again or suggest it to anyone. 1 star is too much but I had to leave it to write the review.",

The octopus sizzling on the iron pan was well cooked and very delicious but after that it was a true disappointment. The fish, the very small serving of of it, was tasty but best item on the menu was the mashed potatoes. For my wife, the ribeye was well cooked but the side items were awful.  The dinner ended in true disappointment with our desserts. Her \u201c3 leches\u201d was obviously meant for a diabetic person. It lacked richness, sweetness and overall flavor, it was a water-down liquid impersonating the true delicious \u201cleches\u201d of the dessert.

It was 2 available tables, we were told they were reserved for a party of 10. Let's just say we were there approximately 2 hours and they sat a party of 2 at the table and the other remained empty :(  Food arrived:  We ordered chicken Alfredo (they brought out shrimp pasta and my daughter is allergic)  My 2nd daughter ordered the $40 ribeye meal. (Steak was great, potatoes were cold)  My fiancee ordered the $48 dollar seafood platter with veggies ( the meats on the bottom were burned)  I ordered the $36 seafood which came in a bed of rice. ( The rice was swimming in water, I asked was it supposed to have that much water and she said yes it comes like that)  Chicken pasta finally came and let me just say it was delicious :)  We didn't ask for a bill adjustment and we still tipped because our waitress was awesome. I would recommend pasta if you plan to dine here. Everything is Overpriced and not worth it. If you're considering eating here try something different in the area.  It was a romantic setting but we will not be returning :(",

I\u2019ve lived in the area for over 20 years and somehow have never been in. I tried calling at 11:40 with no answer. So I figured we would show up and maybe they would be friendly. Boy was I wrong. The young man behind the host counter had a not caring attitude with obvious multiple table free for business. When I told him I tried calling he asked me when as if I was lying. I asked for a manager because I won\u2019t accept that in my hometown I would get this kind of treatment. The manager shirt his panic gentlemen (using the word to be polite) as I tried to introduce myself he felt the need to grab my hand forcefully, not at all how a manager of a business should \u201ccome at\u201d a customer. When I told him the store he said we were closed an hour ago. So if your happy hour starts at 11:30 and I called at 11:40 you were closed? Sure thing. I also manage a business and have always treated my customers with respect and would never treat someone like this guy treated me and my friend who is in the service industry also. Very disappointed in how I was treated and the attitude and accusation type attitude this place gave me. What a shame, looked so nice and I was so looking forward to having a great time with my friend. Can\u2019t talk about the food wasn\u2019t allowed to try it.

They served me and treated me like it was 7pm, hostess said Yeah we closing in about 25mins you have plenty of time. He Invited us in, seated us in a great table next to window. Once again this place closes at 10, we never felt pressured to eat fast or we never felt that awkward look someplaces give you to make you leave. The server recommendations were also amaizing. We asked for a bottle that they ran out, so he came with wine samples for us to try similar to the one we originally ordered. The food presentation is very good, the food taste is amazing. The quality and portions size are outstanding. I will definitely be coming back here again! This is a place that is worth giving a try, and keep coming! Highly recommended guys!",

No such luck because their phone system doesn't give you the option.  Oh, and if you make a reservation, they use Yelp and confirm with phone via text. We did.  Showed up, didn't have our reservation.   Was dead that night, so no big deal.  But, simply unprofessional.  Service was excellent and free oysters on Wednesday were great too.  But, they are  bad at cooking scallops.  What can I say. ...Or scallops were just bad.  small too.  they said \"jumbo scallops\" but  definitely were not jumbo.  bigger than Golden Coral scallops, yeah, but not much bigger and didn't taste any better.  good  scallops are never chewy!  also sides shouldn't be cold.. especially at $7 per side.  Furthermore, they refuse to do blue-cheese olives in a martini. Now, if you know martinis.. or quality bars, you know they will do blue-cheese olives.  For a place that brags about their drinks and charges $55+ for a single entry.. and $20+ for an appetizer and $7 for a side of white rice, you would think they understand the blue-cheese olives option.   additionally, they don't even have cocktail olives.. they only have the small kind.  simple unprofessional.  Other than those things, we liked the place.",

Upon speaking with the manager we were seated promptly. While waiting one of the managers came to our table and apologized they had a crisis in the kitchen. While sitting we heard people complain about waiting 40+ minutes for their food. We were given our appetizers and wine within 10~ minutes but it took about 40+  minutes for the main course to come out. We were skeptical upon seeing this but decided to stick it out. The food was good, but 20+ minutes later I immediately began to feel sick. I unfortunately had to rush back to my hotel. It was Valentines day and I believe they sat more than they could serve which was unfortunate. We came and left before many and we could tell all hell had broken loose. Servers were running around like crazy and we had to seek out the manager to get our check, weird! The food tasted good but not sure if the wine or food made me sick.",

On Tuesday evening, I placed a rather large/expensive order for delivery via Grub Hub.  After the order was 30 minutes late, I called Grub Hub to inquire about the order status (which was still showing as \"your meal is being prepared by the restaurant\"), only to find out -- after 15 minutes on hold -- thae restaurant was having kitchen problems/issues & canceled my order.  WTF?  The restaurant never contacted me or Grub Hub to advise of this -- instead, I had to call after the order was 30+ minutes late to find out that the restaurant would not be coming through.  A pathetic experience & a clear indication that management does not have a clue how to communicate w/its customers.",

Almost all the servers are too busy using their phones to post on instagram and facebook about the view and talk about the wonderfull day to their social media.

It seems to strictly to draw the young, trendy crowd that has moved into this area of Biscayne Blvd, just north of downtown and down the street from the Adrienne Arsht center.  The only real redeeming thing about this location is the view and only if you are sitting outside at a table next to the railing. Very nice views.  The food is not terrible and actually rather average but compared to the original location on the river, the food is rather sub par. It does not seem as fresh. The fish is fine but the sides seem to have been sitting under a heat lamp for some time.  As mentioned in several other reviews, the service is lacking but there are a few people that really shine trying to smooth out the issues that occur in the rest of the restaurant experience.  The really sad part about this location is that the river front location has better, fresher food, nicer views, and a much more mixed and relaxed crowd that range from people dressed for a fancy night out to people who have arrived by boat wearing bermuda shorts, flip flops and a t-shirt.  Spend the extra 15 minutes to get to the river front location and really enjoy what Casablanca Seafood is all about.",

The waiter spoke sketchy English, and seemed to have an attitude - which came out once i had to return a $50 steak - ordered med-well done and received it still screaming& bloody.  Asked him to get it cooked the way I asked, and it was returned same way.  This is when I got attitude when I told the guy what a disgrace this was for it to be wrong 2x.  Since I used to wait on tables,  I know what goes on in restaurants (see movie \u201cWaiting\u201d) amd wasn\u2019t about to get sick eating what he presented.  Both he and the female manager seemed to find it funny it was done like that, and I was irritated.  I left with no apology,  nor an offer of a free meal after my co-worker ate her $50 plate of mostly mashed potatoes and SOME fish.  I received nothing other than an empty stomach at this place, and frankly I\u2019m probably lucky!  STAY AWAY!!",

Another server sat us and it took over 30 minutes to get a fish sandwich, conch balls, and chicken Cesar salad. Mind you the place was empty.  The service was awful. The conch fritters didn\u2019t have any conch just fritters and to top it off I found hair in my salad. I told this to the waitress I also showed her. She didnt charge me for the conch fritters but for everything else. I will never visit there again.",
