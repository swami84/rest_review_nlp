Because there were so many tourists, they never seemed to care about getting an order right so I stopped going for two years and opted for a great spot on Havemeyer. Today, I had TWO bad impressions here. I stopped in for breakfast and ordered a bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel with salt, pepper, and ketchup and asked for the bagel to not be cut (so the ketchup wouldn't make a mess). It's cut, there's no salt, pepper or ketchup and it tasted bland as hell. Moving on, I figured I'd give this place one more shot. So I ordered the Philly \"Deluxe\" from the grill menu later that same day. The Philly on the menu is priced at $5.99 and to \"deluxe\" it (side of fries) costs an additional $2.5. So I go to pay and I get charged 7.5 for the sandwich and the 2.5 for the \"deluxe\". I ask, why am I being charged more than what it clearly says on your digital menu. I'm told that they haven't gotten to update the menu prices yet (this place has been open for at least a week if not two now if not longer so who knows how many people are seeing prices for one thing and being charged differently). I said \"never mind, just cancel it\", mainly because I'm just urked at this place and how it seems no different than the last spot that was here. Dude's brand new to the register and says it's already been charged. I didn't feel like wasting his time when he doesn't know what he's doing anyway, so I just bite my tongue and wait. So, the Philly came out alright. Nothing great but not bad. It's exactly what I'd expect from a deli Philly. That said, I'm not coming here again. There goes another couple year boycott and a swift return to old reliable over on Havemeyer down the street. Ofc, telling everyone else who used to boycott this place because it seems like nothing has really changed. I can be pretty lazy so it takes a lot for me to get aggravated enough put up a neg review. Well done BBBC. 2 stars for getting 1 of 2 orders right while overcharging me and essentially telling me to deal with it. This is a place that heavily relies on it's location and tourists for business. The vibe I get here is that they couldn't give a rat- F* about anyone who ever comes in. Good luck getting any \"regulars\".",

        "caption": "Several months ago had a very bad experience. Lost my faith in people that day. We are a busy medical office and order frequently for the last 2 years from them. Never had a problem. Gave them great business. I was on a first name basis with entire staff, Chevy, Roy, Anton, etc. Well the drug companies buy us brunch about once a week and we send them to the 220 Bushwick location. The last time we ordered 3 of the lox bagel breakfast special which comes with salmon lox, cream cheese, tomato onion and capers. Apparently there was a mix up although i can't understand how it happened. When I got back to the office with the food we found 3 bagels, not toasted and with ONLY Lox, no cream cheese, no tomato, no onion and no capers. The real disappointment came when i called to explain to Roy what happened. I mean we are good customers. Well Roy was not very nice nor willing to rectify the mistake. He said, \"Tony I can't do more than one bagel with Lox but the way he said it was not friendly. No apology no remorse. I did not go back for almost a month. I was honestly a bit embarrassed to go. I am not type of guy to beg for anything and i went simply to buy some food. Roy pulled me to the side and asked me why I didn't speak to him directly when this happened I couldn't believe he didn't remember that i HAD called him and his attitude was poor. Of  course I had already posted on the web site a review of what had happened and my feeling is that Roy read it and had a change of heart due to  bad publicity. So Roy pulls me to the side and i reminded him that he said he would give me a free bagel with lox made properly. He started preaching that he couldn't do anything as this had happened over a month ago and I didn't  notify him. Well I HAD spoken to him, I mean why would I NOT talk to a manager I knew well when something like that happened. He insisted i didn't speak to him so i simply said, \"Well no more business from us I am not coming back\" Chevy made a hurtful remark from behind the counter. He said and I quote, \"Tony, we have a LOT of customers\" obviously implying that my business would not be missed. Anton was apologetic and the short Spanish guy also apologized and they were both obviously feeling bad for me and how I was treated. Those 2 guys are very nice and know  how to treat people. Roy and Chevy can kiss my butt. So I left and Roy called me twice telling me i should have spoken to him when it happened  but he simply couldn't or wouldn't comprehend that I DID speak to him.One good thing came out of this. I changed my location and began to go to the Grand street branch. The manager is a doll. Knows how to treat people and has family working there who are super nice and they make GREAT food. Roy skimped so much on the Lox i had to pay 2 dollars extra to get a good sandwich but in the Grand Street location they don't skimp. Sandwiches are better and service is fantastic.Francis the manager bends over backwards to make everything perfect. So, don't you all think that if Roy's location screwed up 3 bagels with Lox they simply should have made them over? Instead i get nasty comments and backtalk and lies about how I mishandled the situation. I will be calling Daniel, one of the owners to advise him of this. Meanwhile Folks, Go to the grand street location near Bushwick ave and share a mile with Francis while she goes out of her way to make you a great sandwich. I'm so glad I went there. We gave them 160 dollars worth of business this week and well worth it. 0 stars for 220 Bushwick and 5 for grand street locale.",

Two hours of back and forth and nobody in the store could speak honestly as to the status of my delivery order, misleading me saying the order is out or will be out, different things every time I called...  Waiting after I finally get one of the guys in the store to make a new order and send it, 15 minutes later I get a call from the delivery guy. My thought-\"Finally, my food is here!\" I was wrong. The guy had called to inform me that he had already made that delivery to my apartment. To my apartment? That's impossible. Either he got the address wrong and somebody didn't care to correct them at the chance of a free breakfast, or the guy was lying to be ok with his bosses. Whatever the case, there was absolutely no need for a delivery guy to call my personal cel phone and insinuate dishonesty from my part.  Understanding there is no way I can enjoy a meal from these people after this, I called to cancel, not without first having to hear some empty apologies and lip service from the guy at the store. Bravo, Bread Brothers, for being my first ever customer review.",
