It\u2019s absolutely asinine, especially in a time like this, that they would refuse someone who is actively giving them money. When the delivery man arrived he was angry and said \u201cNever again!

At first my original review was 3 stars  but after trying them a few more times they earn an extra star.  This place has a lot going for it. They do a good job of cranking out orders in about 10 min, the staff is chill and polite, hrs are great and the prices are definitely fair for the portions. Still agree with some of the reviews here. Definitely an element missing when it comes to spices but I think that can be remedied by asking for more of what you want. Still sticking with questioning the quality of  some of the ingredients but when considered to the price and portions it makes sense and does not completely ruin the overall taste. Some dishes are stronger than others fah sure but overall it\u2019s worth it and it hits the spot.",

I will agree with other reviewers that the service was extremely prompt, and the serving size is large but that's about where it ends.  The food itself was mediocre at best. I felt like i ordered from a Chinese restaurant opposed to a Thai restaurant--the food was bland and lacked the authentic spices and flavors which is the main embodiment of Thai food. The shrimp pad Thai I ordered tasted like dry ramen, and I could count the pieces of shrimp it contained on one hand. If you're a genuine Thai food lover--don't expect much ordering from here.",

Cashews and cabbage and a wonderful mild yellow curry that kept you wanting more! The basil saut\u00e9 with tofu had 6 kinds of vegetables and light on the oil so you could taste them. The spring rolls (4) were nicely fried and surprisingly non greasy. Took one hour but worth it! Takeaway is probaly quicker than delivery. Just order ahead!",
