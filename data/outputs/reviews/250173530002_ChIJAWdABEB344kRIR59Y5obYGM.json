        "caption": "It is infuriating to see that someone would leave a nonsensical negative review for an already struggling business during a pandemic. The city has less workers therefore scheduling and permitting will 100% take longer. While the new owners have to figure out how to finalize their operations as well as making sure they are legally able to operate in their city, it's highly unlikely that they will have time to make a sign that gives a definitive time and date for opening, because they likely still did not know.  My fiancee and I had the privilege to meet the owners of Cicada Coffee Bar, and bless them, they are amazing people. Full of passion, full or heart. They bring the true artistry of culinary experience to the plate. We saw this at their mini menu tasting, and expect nothing less from them once they fully open.  They are humble, their food is delicious and thoughtful, and they do their part in changing the world as well as the food scene in Cambridge. 5 stars from our team at Phinista Cafe. Nothing less, and wishing we could rate even higher.",
