Elliot was our waiter and provided fast and friendly service, he was also able to make some great recommendations on food. We had the fried alligator, jambalaya, and the blackened red fish. Our favorite was the blackened red fish, my husband said it was his favorite dish that he has had since coming to New Orleans.",

The umbrella of the sunshade can change its direction according to the movement of the sun, and it is really functional. The one pint huge ass beer you ordered will make you forget the moisture. The performers gathered below their eyes to perform their own actions, and they had a unique atmosphere that they couldn't leave. In addition, the two boys started hitting the drums instead of the plastic buckets, creating a strangely comfortable rhythm. The last order of Jambalaya and beer goes great together. Even though it was a one-hour stay, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.

The genius who didn't use anything to write down anything expected me to wait so he could put my order in after I asked. Horrible service...not even a refill. If it wasn't for my wife I would have left a 1 cent tip.  If there was a -on a star I would have selected it. My 9 year old chose not to eat.

The red beans and rice was very plain, not spicy or flavorful, at all. Service: We ate on the balcony, the servers were confused as to which tables were theirs; our server spilled water all over my son then (accidentally) hit him in the face with the plates when trying to clear the table (but like how does that happen?), and then walked around for 5 minutes with our card forgetting to run it so we could cash out. Atmosphere: you can hear bands playing nearby which is cool, but keep in mind if you want to have conversation you won't be able to if you're on the balcony, also the balcony is tilted downwards, towards the street which is kind of weird for your positioning as you end up sitting sideways... which I mean, isn't the worst but like its awkward. But, there is seating inside both downstairs and upstairs. The restrooms upstairs (I'm not sure if there were any downstairs) are very interesting- I don't think there is air flow in them, and only allow for one person at a time. Lastly, I'm starting to wonder if this is an issue in a lot of the buildings, but while in the staircase all you can smell is the overwhelming wafting of natural gas.",

My friends' dad took half of his Po-Boy bread off in order to let it soak up the drip. We eventually asked to speak to the manager. The waitress called him over and said that we were complaining because \"The pipe is dripping AGAIN.\" (This is apparently a known issue but they still continue to seat people at this table even when not busy) The manager looked at the pipe and the table and smiled then shook his head and left. He never said a word.I guess that Southern hospitality got soggy like the po boy bread. I live in the quarter near here so it's convenient but I'm done giving this place a chance. 3 strikes you're out!",

I've been to 15 different restaurants and ordered the same drink and usually  in a glass what about 16 oz of liquid not including ice. Upon my initial complaint to the manager, he then he explained since we are on the upper deck they cannot we serve this drink in a glass container which is why the cup is plastic. Totally missing the point, I made it known to the manager that the drink was received in a plastic cup that was half empty, literally. The manager then look at me with a straight face and asked me whether or not I would like a smaller cup.  Knowing that this man was looking at me insulting my intelligence he kept the conversation more focus on the fact that the drink had to be served in a plastic cup rather than glass telling me that it would look different if you served it to me and a regular Fountain glass and only appearing to be a small portion in a plastic cup. I would strongly suggest if you want more bang for your buck and ordering a drink with your meal, do not bother coming to this restaurant because not only do they rip you off they insult your intelligence and belittle you.",

We asked to sit on the upper balcony and ate our authentic cuisine while watching the crazy people on Bourbon St. The food was delicious, and very reasonably priced. I got Red Beans and Rice for $16 and got a delicious, generous portion with cornbread to die for. My husband got \"Taste of New Orleans\" for $18 and it consisted of real jambalaya, gumbo and cachon de lait....It was the perfect meal and our waitress, Maiya, was outstanding. Telling us about the food and the area. She was truly a beautiful person, on the inside and out. We definitely will stop there next time we visit NO. Side note....the next day we went to get a beignet at the famous Cafe Du Monde, and decided to sit by the water on the riverwalk area on a perfect weather day. We sat on a bench and realized we could see Maiya (our waitress from Cornet) sitting a ways down, probably waiting to start work. She didn't know we could see her. A local lady was selling beer and waters out of a rolling cooler and walked past Maiya, Even though Maiya was going to work in a bit, she called them woman over to buy a water and help her out with a sale,,,and then Maiya asked the man who had been sitting by himself, a bench away from her, if he wanted a water or a beer. It was apparent the man was down on his luck and her random act of kindness was amazing. He accepted her offer, and got a beer. Maiya paid for it, put her headphones back in and they went back into their separate worlds. We will never forget witnessing her kindness. The world would be a better place with more people like her.",

Hubby had shrimp and grits and we both had Hurricanes to drink.  Now onto the fun part...not really.

The Caesar's Salad was a joke, a very sad affair. Along with a cocktail and beer and taxes over $ 47. And we were quickly billed without asking - we probably wanted to get rid of us quickly. Overall not a particularly good experience - despite the balcony.  (Original) Typische Touristenfalle auf der Bourbon Street. Der Balkon ist wirklich super und war der Grund f\u00fcr die Entscheidung, hier eine Kleinigkeit zu essen. Dann h\u00f6rte es aber auch schon schnell auf super zu sein.

Das Po-Boy-Sandwich war okay, mit 15 Dollar allerdings \u00fcberbezahlt. Der Caesar's Salad war ein Witz, ein ganz traurige Angelegenheit. Zusammen mit einem Cocktail und einem Bier und Steuern \u00fcber 47 Dollar.

I mean, I even tried putting salt and pepper and that didn't even help and my husband's poboy barely had any shrimp, sad. I would have told the waitress but she got seated a large group so she never came back. When I asked for a manager, she finally came with the bill. I told the manager my complaints and he said that he just got called to work there and straighten things out. However he is not doing a good job because you think after I told him about the bland food , the 6 shrimp on the poboy , no refills or the fact nobody ever came back to checked on us , that he would take something off the bill. Well he did nothing but give us a sad story about coming back to the restaurant to fix all the issues that they have there at that place..Please. The next time I drive an hour to New Orleans to get some food ,  You can bet your money it won't be from this place  Because they are definitely given New Orleans a bad reputation for food. Pricey No flavor food...!                     ",

Unfortunately everything about it proved it was a tourist trap with sub par food and service. Ordered tator tots that were obviously microwaved to melt the shredded cheese. Burgers didn\u2019t have much flavor and also had shredded cheese under the burger. No attempt made to even melt it and when the manager came over he claimed that shredded cheese was a southern thing. This was our 3rd burger in New Orleans and the first one with shredded cheese. I gave two stars because the manager comped part of our meal, but left feeling like we had made a bad mistake. Don\u2019t waste a meal here when you can eat at so many other amazing restaurants!",
