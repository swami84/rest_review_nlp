I was there last weekend. The service was outstanding despite them being short staffed. Jacob was my server. As a matter of fact Jacob was the only server that day and he took care of all his tables with grace! I noticed the owner was there but wasn\u2019t helpful at all. All he did was hover and stress out his staff. He didn\u2019t check on the tables nor did he lend a hand in serving knowing he only had one server that day. As a customer I was a bit uncomfortable with his energy and disappointment that he wasn\u2019t a team player. (You can\u2019t run a business w/o your staff so treat them with respect and be a team player). Other then that the food was amazing and the plating was pretty. I will definitely be back and hopefully this time if the owner is there I hope he helps out. After all why be there if you aren\u2019t going to help?",

Also the onion rings were terrible. I bit into them and they were filled with oil. Just know when you order the sweet potatoes fries it will be a smaller portion than most would expect. Also be aware they charge 18% gratuity for you on your bill. Maybe service was so slow because there was only one server but the place had four tables seated so I don't understand what took so long. Wouldn't recommend.",

Everything is organic and tasted fresh. I got the Weekender burger, Caesar salad and truffle fries. Everything was made perfectly, my favorite was the truffle fries. Their outdoor seating is nice as well. It\u2019s very warm and cozy. I was served by Mike, very friendly server, very caring and fast. I highly recommend this place for organic burgers, you won\u2019t be disappointed!!",
