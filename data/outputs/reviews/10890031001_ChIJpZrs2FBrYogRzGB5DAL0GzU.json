All dishes are made to order and while you watch, so if you order their Rock bowl, be patient; they don't start making the fried shrimp until you order it. It's worth waiting for, as they come out piping hot and crispy. Try The Rock with squid-ink rice and arugula as your base, and prepare for the spicy togarashi sauce with peanuts; it's easily a two-beer dish.  Draft Asahi beer is available, as is chilled sake and soda. There are lots of exotic drinks in the chiller, and American sodas in the self-serve.  This is a great place to go for something different; you'll want to be a regular.",

I ordered a Build Your Own Poke Bowl with sushi rice, little spinach, scallions and salmon - I wanted to build something that resembles Chirashi-Zushi. It costs $14 which I thought was little expensive since they only give you a \u201cscoop\u201d of chopped salmon.  Their sushi rice was pretty good and salmon was very fresh. Overall, it wasn\u2019t a bad poke bowl but wasn\u2019t anything exceptional (I had to ask for Wasabi since they don\u2019t just offer you). My hotel was near by and poke bowl wasn\u2019t bad so I went back for dinner (take out again). I wanted something simple so I got tuna, salmon and yellowtail rolls.  Once again, all the fish was fresh and delicious, and sushi rice was good.  But something about them was not 100% right - maybe it was Nori or the way they were rolled or something.  That\u2019s why I give it 3 stars.",

We shared a few sushi rolls and they were so delicious. I\u2019m a huge sushi fan so I am particular when it comes to freshness and presentation. Well they nailed it.

The edamame was fresh and flavorful, and the multiple sauce options were delightful. I had a bright, citrus ponzu, with a deeply funky furikake.  The takoyake was light and fluffy, but had an ultra rich seafood filling.  My only holdback from 5 stars is the price. Not overly expensive, but too much to make it a daily fix. The staff was immensely helpful and accommodating, and tlrounded out a wonderful lunch date with my daughter. If in the area, this is a \"must-try\".",

I'm definitely picky about my seafood, and I'm lactose intolerant, so this place is a boon with all of the amazing quality options. The woman who selects all of their seafood is amazing, and I can easily see the care and dedication she puts into her work.  For citrus and fresh flavors, my favorite thing on their menu right now is the Hamachi Pesto bowl with I think fresh yellowtail. For a sweeter kick, my boyfriend adores the Asian Chipotle bowl.

The reason this restaurant did not receive the extra 2 stars is the young lady behind the counter. I don't know her name, as she didn't have a name tag, so for this review we'll say her name is \"Shannon\" my apologies if there is in fact an employee at Oshi Poke named Shannon who is a delightful person that is good at her job, this is not intended for you...just go in and look for the dark haired girl who looks as though she can make puppies explode with an icey stare... that's \"Shannon\" This was our first visit to Oshi and we were unsure what to order. I tried to break the ice with Shannon and admitted to being first timers and not having a clue what to order...I then asked Shannon for a suggestion...not a kidney..a suggestion. Shannon was quite apathetic with a faint whif of liberal arts degree. My concern is this is the face of your establishment...and she has the personality of an arthritic game of thump knuckles. The rest of the staff was at least amicable. The sushi chef didn't say anything, but at least he gave alittle smile. We were not the only patrons given this treatment from Shannon...she doesn't seem to like people very much... especially people in the market for raw fish...which would be a conflict of interest at a sushi joint. Perchance \"Shannon\" would be better suited in another field of work...like if a personality factory had a horrific overflow of the personality tanks, Shannon could act as a human shamwow, and come in and soak all the excess personality. I'm not saying fire her, maybe it was an off night for Shannon...but if this is a hibitual habit, let's look at dish duty.",

The veggies and seafood are always super fresh and the restaurant is always very clean. A bit refreshing to see some ingredients there that you definitely won't find in most places, leaning more towards a healthy alternative, away from the stir-fry's and egg rolls you might find at other Asian restaurants. Worth a visit, if you're not a fan of trying new things, get the ramen. A giant bowl of piping hot ramen with either pork or shrimp, (+4 ingredients), it was one of the best I've ever tried.

I think their order ticketing system could he improved, you place your order then they write it on a tiny piece of paper the size of a cookie fortune and then you wait in line then give it to the cashier.

It's like the Target of sushi and pok\u00e9. If you're in the mood to spend more than you should, but still want to feel good about yourself when you leave, this place is for you.  Edit: I went back to try it again because I heard that they had ramen, so I figured I'd give them a second shot. Well, it is the sheer lack of quality of the ramen that has caused me to actually remove another star from this review. The only reason I won't give them just one star is because they are technically better than the dried and over-salted 10/$1 ramen that you can buy at any grocery store.  Now as for the specifics on  their ramen, the broth is too salty, the pork is dry, and the total absence of seaweed and egg makes the whole dish feel unauthentic. Even excusing all of that, the worst crime is that the noodles are pretty much the same quality or worse than store bought \"ramen.\" They absorb the broth far too quickly and very soon you find yourself eating mush. Unless you're trying to get your date to ask you to take them home, don't bother with this place. I won't return willingly any time soon.",
