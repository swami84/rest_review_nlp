Everything was amazing. The callaloo has a very earthy taste to it and was even better as leftovers, maybe because by the time we got home from picking up the food, everything had cooled a bit (we live about 30 minutes away). We will definitely go back.",

Firstly, it is not 3am, it is currently 5:28pm EST. My rating was posted 3pm 12/14/2020.  Secondly, because of the raving reviews, I drove from Marlton NJ all the way to Philly despite today\u2019s weather and the traffic, to patronize a local TRINI restaurant. I ordered 2 orders of goat roti (buss up), 2 orders of goat roti dhalpurie, 1 order of shrimp wontons and 1 order of chicken chowmein.  I was very much unsatisfied with the taste of EVERYTHING ordered. The goat was very oily, the channa was watery and tasteless, the wontons were soggy, the chicken chowmein was too soft and drowned in some kind of brown sauce. It did not taste like authentic Trini chowmein at all...(was thrown in the garbage) The buss up shot was actually ok,  but the portion was too small for the price.  I did not bother to taste the dhalpurie, but I take  my dad\u2019s word for it.....he wasn\u2019t impressed....and he is an honest critique.  As a born Trini who grew up in Brooklyn, and moved to the suburbs, I was more than willing to drive over an hour for real Trini food, and support a local Trini,  especially during this Covid pandemic.... but to say the least, I was extremely disappointed.  One more thing I must say though, the person who called to let me know the order was ready, and who met me at the door, was very pleasant, quite professional and created a great first impression. It is quite unfortunate that the food did not meet my expectation. Hence the reason for my one star review.",

Calypso music playing softly in the background, although I felt like getting up and dance, but did so in my chair to the amusement of my friends. I ordered the corn soup first, which was very tasty and then my main course, buss up shot, with curry goat and curry chick peas. Ummmm. The buss up shot was hot and silky, the curry goat and chick peas well seasoned. I definitely will be returning and will be spreading the news about Flambo. Hats off to the management and staff.",

They were nice  and accommodated us without a res, but the service was mediocre, we were given a barely cool carafe of water, no other beverages were offered (\"can I get you something to drink?\") The menu was very limited, the one online shows way more than we were handed. The food was bleh. 2 of us got the Pelau and I got the chicken stew which was NOT a stew and not a sign of tomatoes which is deacribed as the base on the menu I was handed. Pelau was bland and boring. Also our plates were piled high with rice but 3 little chunks of chicken, about half a breast. And half of my chicken was barely cooked thru. 3 meals, no drinks, $50????

I was greeted by the owner who presented the menu, and so, I ordered the veggie platter anticipating a flavorful dish....unfortunately it was a total let down. The patchoi consisted mainly of chopped tomatoes and onions and totally lacked flavor. It felt like they're trying to bulk up the veggies with tomatoes and onion which really is a cheap trick. The pumpkin was delicious but the rice was very bland. God alone knows how the meat dishes would have tasted if they couldn't get simple vegetables right. This kind of cooking is not truly representative of our rich Trinidadian cuisine. The cook/chef needs another introduction to authentic Caribbean seasonings as well as new taste buds. It's a shame that these people are passing off mediocre cooking as Caribbean cuisine. I do not recommend going there for true Caribbean cuisine.  Response to Owner  No explanation was needed because we came from the same place...you know that. Patchoi, bok-choi, etc. is generally cooked with roasted garlic and onions. Please don't confuse flavor with \"heavy seasoning.\" Unfortunately there was overkill on the tomatoes and onions. It saddens me that a professional restaurant owner gets defensive rather than receptive about reviews. Psst! Every show has a season...I'm hopeful you'll incorporate authenticity when you film. All the best and have a nicer day.",

        "caption": "We had a Friday evening reservation.  Seating was done quickly.  The person serving as our wait person was friendly and she did a nice job of appearing when needed.  Expectation vs reality is truly the way to sum up the food experience.  Online Menu versus Restaurant Menu: The menu online and the menu we were given were starkly different. Honestly it felt like bait and switch. There was no Phoulourie on the menu.   There were no Roti dishes or Buss Up Shut dishes (which equates to 10 missing items).  There were 3 sides missing from the menu (Callaloo, Rice and Beans, and the Boiled and Fried Cassava).  The menu had no drinks.  I don\u2019t know if they actually had peanut punch or any of the others.  I asked if they had sorrel tea and the wait person advised they would check because they weren\u2019t sure.  They did have it.  Sorrell Tea It was OK.  A bit sweeter than others I have had.  Corn Soup Quite tasty.  Looks nothing like the photo online, this was more of a puree.  Caribbean Salad I don\u2019t know how long it was sitting around.  Mediocre at best.  Veggies Medley Served room temperature.  I am not sure why it wasn\u2019t served hot.  The pumpkin puree was good.  There were 3 green beans on the plate.  The chickpea portion lack flavor.  I spent a lot of time pushing it around on the plate.  The rice was edible.  Chunky Vegetable Chow Mein Served cold.  Overly sweetened sauce.  Sweet Cinnamon Plantains Served cold. I have had these before elsewhere.  Cinnamon is usually an enhancement not the overkill that existed here.  Macaroni Pie It was good.  Unfortunately, it was also served cold.  I had high hopes based on other reviews.  Was the chef not there?  Something must have been wrong that night. It seemed like the food was pre-made and not kept up to temperature or something. It was quite a disappointing experience.  I would expect the food to be served at temperature and have some flavor. We ate what we could because we had an event to go to and no opportunity to get anything else for the night.  What I do know is that we won\u2019t be going back again.  A few notes based on the owners response.  At no point did the server explain the reason for the limited menu.  And the place was not jammed packed.  You had a sign on your door indicating that you didn't have any openings between 6 and 7 p.m. however there were multiple empty tables there with reserved placards on them.  While you may work hard in your establishment, the statements of this experience are factual.",

After buying a small bottle of barefoot for a little over double the price, it seemed unreasonable to have to pay another 50% just to drink it. This should be improved in my opinion.  Response to Owner: I would recommend maybe waiving the fee on the first bottle. The concern that was expressed by staff was that larger parties tend to bring more bottles. So if that\u2019s the case, maybe the establishment can begin charging after the first one or even two.",

I and a couple of friends were looking for a restaurant that offered authentic cuisine from a culture with which we were not familiar. We had the great good fortune to happen upon Flambo.  We immediately were aware the ambiance was real, lovely and very relaxed. But we arrived to an overly full house due to a large private party being held there. When we shared our disappointment about being told there simply was no table available, the staff and chef/owner quickly conferred, regrouped and very graciously made space for us. They truly went out of their way to serve us. In my judgment the word service is used too often as simply a tag line. Flambo provides the real thing. Happily. Sincerely.  The food was in a word, yummy. Well prepared. Beautifully presented. And simply delicious.  We had not only a wonderful meal, but an exceptional experience. If I were a guest in the home of someone to whom I was dear, I would be thrilled to have been treated this well. In a restaurant, a rare gift.  The word that best describes this restaurant, its staff, and the heartfelt mission of Flambo, is love.  I live almost 4 hours away. I will surely return.  My thanks to the chef and owner Anthony, for having hosted us.",

Doubles and pepper shrimp is a must and can't beat the price for authentic Caribbean food! The staff was great and suggested foods since it was our first time at the restaurant. It's also BYOB which is always a plus!",
