We see a lot of opportunist opening up and moving in and taking the soul out of our neighborhood, and rest assured this spot is not one of those spots.  They bring quality and convenience to the table. They accept card, have no minimum for card purchases, (thank god) and this $3 per regular slice may seem pricey, they have a happy hour that let\u2019s you get any two 1 topping slices and a drink for $6 which is great. A nice filling lunch for $6 my guy.  And listen, the don\u2019t use some generic whole sale ingredients. This is good.",

        "caption": "Tried out this new spot, food was good and staff was friendly. The pizza has just enough sauce that it doesn't overpower your taste buds and conplimentss the cheese very well. The Sicilian slice has a different sauce which is a bit more garlicky and sweeter than the normal slice. Garlic knots are se.of the best I've had from a pizza place like this in a long time. They were baked well and heated perfectly so you don't get that cold middle most places give you. Seating is very limited inside, there's a table that fits about 6-8 people on it and a window counter for three people. The pepperoni slices, either regular or sicilian, are my picks.",
