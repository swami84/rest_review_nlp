I really thought this place would be okay judging by the picture.. Never judge a book i guess.  Also only got like 7 pieces of chicken and every other place ive been to always gives me at least twice that amount...  Listen...  I know your restaurant is in a bad area n u get ignorant customers daily But seriously u should take more pride in your food..  Hire new cooks.  I can and have made much better orange chicken.
