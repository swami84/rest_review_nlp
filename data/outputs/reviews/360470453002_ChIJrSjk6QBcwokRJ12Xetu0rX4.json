Your tongue dances for 150 minutes All the menus that come out with the adjustment of strength and strength are sometimes boring and sometimes intense, but the eyes are particularly intense with the unfamiliar taste and the tongue reacts violently. There are other interesting elements everywhere. Do you know the next stage (menu) with a pin light and medium music with LP?

Great and attentive service and everyone was super knowledgeable of the wine and food.  We did not do the wine pairing and just did two nice Italian bottles and that was perfect for the majority of the dishes we had.  I have done other tasting menus (DOM, Pujols, Quintonel), but this was by far the most expensive. With that said, the music was awesome setting a super chill mood, and I think you can requests songs (not 100% on song requests, but it\u2019s basically a playlist they preset and can alter).  Chefs were chill and their break down is fun to watch as it enters the end of the meal. 11/10 would recommend for an interesting Brooklyn Michelin star experience, amazing food, good vibes, good music.",

There were a couple courses that weren't my favorite, though they were still interesting and worth a bite, but that is to be expected over 17 dishes. (Each course is maybe 2-3 bites.) The progression was logical and had a flow from appetizer-type dishes to main course type dishes to desserts. They were harmonious and well thought out. They were also beautiful to the eye.  The server and staff were all terrific. I like their lack of pretension (despite having 2 Michelin stars) and they were really interested in our having a great meal. They were friendly and able to answer any questions about a dish. The wine pairings (plus sake, cider and beer) were very well chosen to complement the courses. The attire is casual and guests who were there that night wore everything from jeans and hipster-hat to jacket and tie, but no judgments and everyone was made comfortable and welcome.  If I had one complaint, and this applies to pretty much all tasting menus, somewhere around course 13 I am completely beyond full and the last few courses (which here included the Wagyu beef) are very uncomfortable. I manage this by having a nibble of these courses and sending the rest over to my husband who has a much bigger capacity than I. But I would like a tasting menu allowing SOME guests to skip a few courses. It's not just Blanca, but pretty much every place I have done tasting menus (and that's a lot of places.) Still, other than the pain to the pocketbook, I would happily eat here regularly.",

        "caption": "I really enjoyed my 2.5-hour tasting course at Blanca. Having read other reviews on Yelp, I thought I might need to order a pizza at the end. Since you walk through Roberta's to get to Blanca, my bf and I eyed people's delicious-looking pizza on our way in. We checked in at where we were on the \"pizza meter\" throughout the night. At first we were at 100% pizza given that we were super hungry, but after the fresh dough course, he was down to 30% and we were full by the end of the dinner. They gave us ridiculously delicious smores as a treat to take home, too.  Each course is only a few bites, but they're packed with flavors and beautifully presented. To me, a great tasting menu like this requires two things: 1) inventive use of ingredients that 2) work well together aka taste is on point. Blanca achieved both of these with flying (minimalist) colors. Particular standouts to me were the garbanzo bean soup, apple with macadamia shavings that melted in the mouth, chewy and rich carbonara, nduja sausage ravioli, sunchoke cake with cardamom and chocolate for dessert, and the fresh dough. If you're asking yourself, how good can pizza dough taste? Try some when it's steaming hot. It really tastes that good.  I also much prefer this laid-back more casual environment without the pretension of some three-star Michelin restaurants like Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. It's not a place to be seen, but rather a place to focus on the food and the experience of watching people absorbed in their craft.",
