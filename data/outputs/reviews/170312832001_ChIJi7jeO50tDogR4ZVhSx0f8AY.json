I ordered a medium chicken and rice bowl with cassava fries. When I got home and opened up the boxes...there were only 3 pieces of chicken in the box rather than the usual 4. The rice was way over cooked and mushy and had no flavor... oh and I\u2019m pretty sure they gave me mild instead of medium. The cassava fries were half raw and there was also a hair in my bag on top of the box for the chicken and rice.  This was probably the worst experience I have had at any Port of Peri Peri locations and I am very disappointed. I would give 0 stars if I could.",

I've now been waiting for 45 minutes and they just told me they would start preparing my order... ___________ (Old) Food is delicious. I've had the Sizzler burger and the couscous salad and they were excellent. Definitely one of the better informal places to eat on Taylor. Only gripe is that it seems to take a while to prepare the food. Not sure if that's because of under staffing or what, but I was waiting for at least 20 minutes last time I was there.",

        "caption": "This location is a perfect example of how not to run a restaurant. I still don\u2019t know how a restaurant that reopened for the second time can be so bad at its operations. Let\u2019s focus on the food for now. I went in for pickup because I have lost all hope at this point that they can get a Doordash order right. This has nothing to do with Doordash as they just pick up the order and the orders are stapled so they can\u2019t check anything. I ordered 2 Chicken and Rice bowl with a combination of sauces, 2 large fries with extra peri salt on both (costs ~50cents/each extra), and 8 peri-mayo sauce (55 cents/each). I also specifically asked for the garlic and hot sauce on the side.  What I actually got: I got 7 of the 8 peri-mayo (so wasted 55 cents here), 2 tiny garlic, and 1 hot sauce. The Schaumburg and buffalo groove location both give 2 garlic and 2 hot sauce per order of entree without even asking. The rest of the order was fine.  Quality: The chicken that came with the rice bowl could not be drier. The rice was very nice (usually consistent between locations). The fries are really nice but the extra peri-salt is a scam. At this location, they never add the extra salt (another waste of ~1$ here). The peri-mayo sauce is usually really good but I think these were old and had gone bad. All of them tasted extremely sour (way more than usual).  Quantity: This is my biggest gripe with this location. I have attached images and you can see how little rice and chicken are served. The large fries are a shame. As you can see in the attached image, the large at this location is less than the regular size at most restaurants. A large fries order at the Schaumburg location is 2-3x the size of the fries at this location.  Overall, I think this restaurant is a textbook example of a bad restaurant. Located near the University of Illinois - Chicago, basically a scam to steal from students and give them the smallest food portions. I love the food at the Port of Peri Peri. I actually prefer that to Nando's which offers similar options. With that said, the food at this location is not that at all. If you want quality and a great Port of Peri Peri experience then go to the Schaumburg location.",

RE: Order # X1V-9QU My husband and I tried your Algonquin location about 6 weeks ago. We loved everything about it. The decision was happily made shortly there after to enhance our son\u2019s rehearsal dinner with your delicious wings and falafel. I ordered online and understood the delivery would be coming from your Chicago UIC location. Our rehearsal dinner was being held very close to this location. I received an email confirmation from EZ CATER around 3:30pm on 8/31 (the day of the event) with a delivery window of 6:30-6:45. Here\u2019s where it gets ugly.... I started calling EZ Cater at 6:45pm to get an update on the delivery window. I was on hold with a very polite and concerned representative who had to keep placing me on hold as she was trying to reach someone onsite at the restaurant. My daughter was also trying to reach the restaurant as well. My daughter got through finally. Here\u2019s the unreal part, the restaurant informed her that a manager did not convey the order to the staff. They placed her on hold and NEVER CAME BACK!! She gave up and hung up after 9 mins. . EZ Cater communicated to me at 7:00pm that the order was being refused. How does that even happen?? I had an email confirmation that I had paid for! This was a very important night and your food was a part of the celebration. What a mess! I\u2019ve been in the food/catering industry for years and could never imagine demonstrating anything of the sort. I\u2019m looking forward to see what customer recovery efforts you offer. You can bet if it doesn\u2019t match the inconvenience and horrendous lack customer service that evening, I will never walk in your restaurant again and also this review will appear on many social media sites.",

Also got the chicken pita, which was good, but from these two options, I would suggest to try the 1st. Falafel pita is smaller in size, but worth the try. This place has a big sitting area. When paying you get to enter you phone number for discounts  that add up.  When eating inside, they pick up the plate for you. Overall, it's a good place. Will come back.",

The quality of the food is phenomenal: very moist, well seasoned and flavorful. They have a lot of choices of drinks from fountain drinks to specialized drinks. They also have many options besides just chicken but side dishes as well. In addition, there is a few choices for dessert and they sound all great. I personally had the brownie and carrot type cake.

The workers in the kitchen looked very lazy and they were on their phone. The fries were not fresh, you could see bags of frozen fries in the kitchen.
