The entrance kind of served as its own experience itself! Second off, the service was impeccable! They truly make you feel at home (Oscar was the best and even gave us the recipe to our favorite cocktail).  Third off, the food and drinks were SO flavorful and tasty!!! We did the prefix menu and I HIGHLY recommend it - what sets this place apart from other prefix menu offering restaurants is the price. $45 for a 4 course menu that includes full size entrees is hard to beat - I hope it stays that way. Additionally, they were having a 3 for $30 cocktail offering for Valentine\u2019s Day that was amazing! Unique cocktails for such a great deal. It would be a great idea for them to adopt this to a more frequent occasion.  Overall, an amazing Valentine\u2019s Day experience but I see myself coming back very soon for just a casual Saturday night when I want great cocktails, a great meal, and great service for a great price.",

We were then treated to a visually and aromatically appealing dessert (just ask about the Smokey dessert and they\u2019ll know what you\u2019re talking about). The view of the city was stunning and worth a stop just for that.  Looking forward to trying the other half of the menu and a few more of their craft cocktails on our next visit!  Highly recommend!",

It was below average, actually way below average. The appetizers: short lamb ribs was mediocre at best, served cold, didn't have much taste to it, it was dry and came with a presentation that was unbelievably amateurish. The carrot appetizer was just some large sized, uncut whole carrots with some steak seasoning sprinkled on top which is available at Costco, nothing special about it; I can fairly compare it to some carrots bought from the Whole foods, cooked in the oven and put some seasoning on it at home! what a shame!... The main was again an extremely underwhelming cut of steak (if you can call it a steak!?!) that was fridge cold upon being served, rough texture, extremely small portion of probably 4oz? of under-seasoned cut of meat that I could only see being justified as an appetizer; the potato cubes?! that came with it was terrible, inedible, cold and hard. The salad accompanying the steak in the dish was irrelevant to the dish. It seemed like they are trying too hard but don't know what should go where. The dessert of ice cream and chocolate mousse was just that: ordinary vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse! The Service was great and courteous, ambiance was cold and below average for what they are trying to be, so overall it was nothing special to recommend. Would I return? Definitely not, and I don't see them lasting very long purely for the absolutely mediocre food quality and extremely disappointing dishes they offer!",

We had the mushrooms and carrot appetizer. The carrots were so mushy it was like eating baby food. We also got the butternut squash. The server asked how we liked it and we said we didn\u2019t, she said she would tell the chef \ud83d\ude44. We didn\u2019t eat it but they still charged us. We bought a $120 bottle of wine and my girlfriend liked it so I gave the a 2 star.  The main course we ordered was the lamb, which was good and probably the item we actually ate. The fish we ordered was dry. It had to be less than 4oz.  I couldn\u2019t figure out what the hell this place was trying to be....  we were listening to Tom Petty, while looking at a wall, with a different server bringing over what looked and tasted like a Chef that is more interested in being called a chef than preparing just good food.  The hostess sitting in the lobby on her phone should have warned me.  I hate to give poor reviews because I know how difficult a restaurant is to own and operate but unfortunately the investors got scammed on this over priced wanna be fine dinning restaurant.  $275 for dinner and we had to eat again at 10!",

With the hidden and unexpected setting within Northwestern Memorial Hospital deterring the average tourist, this place sets itself apart from other Mag Miles spots. The service is exceptional, the ambiance warm and welcoming, and the food \u2014 wow. Order anything; it\u2019s all spectacular. The chef pays close attention to detail and expertly blends flavors, so that each bite of food tastes slightly different than the last. It\u2019s such an interesting experience that I\u2019m inclined to recommend going alone just so that you can savor every delicious flavor melting in your mouth without having to worry about making conversation. It\u2019s seriously that good. Be sure to pair your meal with one of their fabulous cocktails \u2014 another highlight on the menu. I would say that, in general, I am difficult to please when it comes to food/restaurants, but Woodwind has left me absolutely speechless. And for the price, there\u2019s no beating it. This is a place that immediately gained a top spot on my list of favorite restaurants, and I\u2019ll definitely be going back over and over again.",
