We were able to sit where we wanted but had to go to the register to place our order and the waiter brought over the food to us. None of us really enjoyed the food but the water. Three adults and one child. I felt the food was rushed and not seasoned well. And I ate a half done raw burger! I was really hungry so I went with the burger and added salt, pepper, ketchup and it already had bbq sauce so it made it more tasty. I didn\u2019t notice how raw the burger was until my friend ask \u201cyou eat your food that way\u201d? And I said what you mean and she pointed out the half done cooked burger. I should of took it back to them and ask for a fully cooked burger which I would of thought they would of asked how I wanted it done but I just let it go and decided to write this review and took photos. And they were about to close so we didn\u2019t bother because my friend said his burger was the same because he noticed it but said he didn\u2019t want to make a fuss. I know some people eat their food this way and I didn\u2019t want to waste it but I shouldn\u2019t have eaten it my stomach was messed up right after. The cashier and waiter seemed nice but the service of giving us a raw burger made me give them two stars. I will not be going back and don\u2019t recommend because the food that we ordered wasn\u2019t tasty.",

When I followed up after hours of waiting, she hung up on me. Called back - my call was ignored. \ud83d\ude0f. Now I have to improvise last minute after inquiring for over a week.

In understand outdoor dining can be tricky but at least level the table so people can sit comfortably.  I gave in my order and when the drinks came one water instead of 2 , no straws, no stirers for the coffee. The food came and again no salt pepper etc... they never came back to bring it and by that time the food was cold. So we went in to get salt pepper etc, there is no jelly... what?! Everything should have been brought out together on a tray  all at once.. Everyone was in the phone helping takeout orders They should be a designated person doing outdoor and one to do take out..

The baked goods in baskets above the pastries are especially stellar, particularly their croissants and jelly doughnuts. Come early for a chance to grab some and more variety. They know how to keep things exciting.  Before coming and ordering: 1. Check online for updates on weekly specials! Online access to menu pricing as it turns out they offer online orders for pickup (pastries and baked goods aren't available online) or delivery (GrubHub). They do events as well! 2. Upon entering, scope out what's available inside and above the display case. We nabbed up the last 2 doughnuts close to noon. 3. Take a menu and find yourself a seat to contemplate options. 4. Ready? Head up to register to order. 5. Sit + wait for made-to-order food.",

I must say the look of the cafe was very nice for a not so convenient area to be in. The tables and stools were a bit sticky but still stayed for the food. Went with my two kids and we were not the least bit impressed. Is it better than the diners in the area perhaps but we have had better food and definitely better coffee and hot chocolate. My daughter ordered a soda which was poured into a plastic cup with a lid fine until she noted what looked like a gnat stuck on the inside of the lid. We didn\u2019t want to make a scene about it so we just left it alone no mention of it. The coffee was more like diner coffee nothing with real flavor and the hot cocoa was more like hot milk. Again lacking flavor we thought this cute cafe would deliver. The food was pretty much the same. The presentation alone is definitely a four or five star presentation but between the taste and flavor rapidly reduced our desire to come back. The people were very friendly which brought up the rating in my eyes thought we won\u2019t be heading back anytime soon.",

If you have all the time in the world and the patience of a saint with an entire morning to spare, by all means enjoy! However, for the majority of us, the experience won't be that enjoyable. I ordered ahead of time for pickup and wasn't given a timeline for when the food would be ready. Given it was a two item breakfast order, I assumed the \"We'll see you soon\" meant \"Be read shortly\". As soon as I walked in, I knew I was in for trouble. The front-house staff moves at a snail's pace with ZERO urgency to serve the customers. There's no defined system of who is next. Line forms where? During the 30-40 minutes I stood waiting for food, I observed people ordering at the counter ahead of those who were there before them, an agitated man complaining how long his To-Go order was taking, only for the server to bring it out on a tray to dine-in,  another customer bring in a wrong order delivered to his table saying it was the THIRD TIME they gave him the wrong thing. WHAT!? Close down the restaurant for a few days, retrain your staff, create better systems for ordering and efficient delivery of food, and become the great food spot you intended to be because the food really was excellent but completely overshadowed by an abysmal front of house performance.",

Some items were very dry such as the rainbow cookies and  Nutella banana croissant. The cannoli cream sandwich  chocolate sandwich cookie was soft and chewy, but again just a bit too sweet for my liking. Same for the mini carrot cake parfiet. It all looked delicious but I think, for an adult, it was all a bit too sweet. The cappacino was a mixed bag, mine was properly strong and a decent balance of flavor. Wife's was weaker with too much frothed creame. It was quite busy on the Saturday we went with only one two person table available, so we chose to have it all to go. I will give this place a 2nd chance for the food as the menue looks interesting.",

I originally rated it 5 stars since this was by far the best brunch outside of NYC and the service was extremely friendly plus, together with the music and the decor, it provided one of the best dining experiences in LI. I've since notched it down one star because the food quality has decreased, the service is not as friendly as it used to be, and the restaurant is now extremely crowded with long waits in the weekends. I still come here, but not near as often as I used to. If you want a pleasant experience, try to avoid their busy times.",

The latte is okay but the hot chocolate is terrific! The food we ordered unfortunately was not what was expected. The egg white omelette was good but I did not enjoy the taste of turkey, it had a strong chicken flavor and the spicy sauce did not compliment it well. The buttermilk biscuit sandwich had delicious ham and the eggs were nicely over easy but the biscuit itself was messy and had a pepper like taste that wasn\u2019t very pleasant. The staff was kind but definitely needed a more welcoming attitude and service, specially when we asked what they would recommend and the girl who answered seem a bit uninterested in being of any assistance. Lastly the home fries are terrific and the portions provided are great. May try it again, we did see an order of pancakes that looked delicious!",
