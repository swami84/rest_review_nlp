Not too loud, not too quiet. Lots of windows which I loved, pretty decent ambiance, clean bathroom, but super cold, not sure why it was so uncomfortably cold while we had dinner.  I appreciated that they sat us down in an area where there weren\u2019t any people at all because my friend and I had our daughters with us with us. They  tend to get a little loud and rambunctious at times, lol.  Their happy hour drink menu offered bottomless champagne for $22 until 7:30pm which was really cool. The food menu was lengthy, but I have to be honest and say that I struggled with it a bit. There weren\u2019t many entree options in my opinion and there are absolutely zero options for children (this is just an FYI, not kid friendly at all). I ended up ordering the Fried Clams and the Rohan Duck Breast as my entree. The clams were basically fried bread, with no clam, but the duck was delicious, although not very filling (pictured) if I might add. It was nice to try somewhere new and we may be back for drinks one day.",

We grazed on several different dishes that we divided between the four of us while enjoying several different libations. The bar is unique in that it is stocked with several sherries both sweet and dry. If fortified wines are not your thing, they also have several other cocktails featuring other spirits. The food was all delicious from the Beef Wellington to the Caramelized Onion Tart. The surprise hit of the night was the Kale and Cauliflower with a delicious curry sauce! While we didn\u2019t stay for dessert (hard to compete in that category when you\u2019re located across the street from The Cake Shop), I\u2019m sure the dessert options are also delicious. Don\u2019t skip on this gem when deciding where to grab a bite to eat in the city. Side note, I\u2019m not a big oyster fan, but they also have an oyster bar and great happy hour deals on raw oysters if that is your thing!",

Restaurants here typically go out of their way to make you feel \"at home\" - from comfortable decor and lighting to attentive, familial, and friendly service.  All of this is absent from The Imperial, an incredibly sterile environment with stone-faced staff clearly instructed to give the space a pretentious aura. They want you to feel \"privileged\" to have set foot in their restaurant.  The resulting sense of that approach is that the customer feels more like an impediment than a patron. If you're going to create an uninviting experience, then customers will simply uninvite themselves.",

Overall, this place feels more SoHo than AdMo, but I think it will attract people looking for an upscale experience, people visiting from out of town, and guests from The Line hotel a few blocks up. Don\u2019t see this as the hop across the street from Duplex Diner (yet?)",

The person who I assume to be the manager was also extremely accommodating and kind, she placed a drink order for us while we waited to be seated. The food was delicious, we had the uni, oysters rockefeller, gnocchi and agnolotti. Dishes are smaller, tapas-like portions but we were definitely satisfied! Very cool ambiance, with a raw bar on the lower level. If you plan to stop by Dram & Grain after dinner, be sure to make a reservation there as well. If not, their sister bar, Jack Rose, is on the same block and was a lot of fun!",
