I got the chicken khadi (the tastiest dish I got), nihari, special seekh kabob, naans, and kheer. Everything was yummy! I\u2019m definitely going to go back to try their other dishes. For sure getting the khadi again! I didn\u2019t find any of the dishes spicy so if you\u2019re weary of heat this place is a save bet. The food has a modern twist so it\u2019s not 100% traditional Indian but really yummy and I\u2019d probably order from here before other indian/pakistani restaurants!",

We had appetizers of samosas with homemade sauces. Main courses of Fish Basant with Jeera rice, Takka Tak with chicken and cauliflower rice, and Chicken Makhani with Basmati rice, and a side of Eggplant Bharta all served family style. Not pictured are desert of Kheer (rice pudding) and Gulab Jamun Cheesecake (lemon cheesecake). We also tried the Trumer Pils. Everything was so good and well done!  The staff was friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and very welcoming. The restaurant interior was also very well done and appealing. Side note, I love their silverware too!  Will be going back and taking friends. I do recommend reservations while capacity rules are in place as they are taking all precautions.  Side note, I wasn't hungry upon going in, so this review isn't based on being starving!",

If they keep up this quality we will have no problem going back on a regular basis. Very grateful to have such a good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood now. Five stars all around!!",

My only not-love was the samosa, but considering samosas can be had almost anywhere, not a big deal!  Yay for a new restaurant opening up in tough times and a gorgeous interior to boot.",

I chose 4 dishes and each were completely different from each other but totally harmonious! Clean, complex, fresh food.  AND they offer cauliflower rice which was perfect in place of regular rice.  Absolutely delicious and the service was so warm and friendly!",

Fab flavor throughout, but not spicy (I didn't specify anything when ordering so now I know to ask for a bit more heat next time). There will definitely be a next time!",

I think it's a little bit pricey compared to the other couple area Indian restaurants and kind of wish there were smaller/cheaper portion sizes.  There's a lot of interesting dishes on the menu, so I think it's a great choice for groups who are willing to share.",

We had app -sea food bhel, fish amritsari & chips, Entrees - Lamb Gustaba, Chicken Basant,  Takka Tak fish, Tandoor - Seekh Kebab, Garlic Naan, Rice and Gulab Jamun Cheese cake.  Everything was amazing.  The meat dishes were flavorful with amazing texture. The fish and chips crispy outside with a moist inside coupled with a great mint chutney.  The seafood bhel - a great twist on a classic with complex flavors - crunchy, sweet, salty, spicy and soft. The Gulab Jamun Cheesecake - 2 desserts in one - light fluffy cheesecake with plump syrupy Gulab Jamun. Both kept there taste and texture separately but together it was sublime.  All the food melts in your mouth and makes your tastebuds sing.  Can\u2019t wait to try the rest of the menu. Will definitely be going back.",
