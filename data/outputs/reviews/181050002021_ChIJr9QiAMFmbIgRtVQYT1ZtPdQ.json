The quality and variety just wasn't there. They used to have a cheese table with hard and soft varieties. Instead, this year they only had one plate with two hard cheeses next to three types of meat products: deli and slim jim meats. The appetizer table was very generic with pastries we could have gotten at Kroger. Pastries should go with desserts. The dessert table was just as generic. The layout of the place was awkward too. One poor couple had people lining up for the buffet inches from their table. Everyone was watching them eat. Everything just had a very generic food feel to it...like they bought it at Kroger and just placed it in front of us. This was our last year. Way too expensive for the quality. And they didn't have cranberry sauce!!!",
