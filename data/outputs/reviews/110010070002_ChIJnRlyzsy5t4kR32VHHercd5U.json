I offered to buy her a drink and she refused without a second thought. Tried to start a bit of a conversation with her and she blew us off. Very poor temperament for a bartender considering both myself and my friend are bartenders. Had tipped the past 3 bars 25%, I gave her 10%. Will not come back or recommend.",

        "caption": "Arriving after a long drive, we were seated quickly, but at a table that had not yet been wiped down. The hostess set the menus right on top of the crumbs and liquids left by the previous party. There were other open tables available so it was not the case that no other tables were available. A short while later I placed my hand on the seat only to find a chewed plastic straw on the cushion.  We ordered our drinks, and after a 15 minute wait, the beers were finally delivered to our table. We placed orders for an appetizer and our entrees at this time. After the waitress left, we realized that two of the three beers were not what we ordered, and my glass had a large chip in the rim. It took a few minutes to track down our server to get replacement beers. With our proper beer order and undamaged glass in hand, we waited for our appetizer to arrive.  And waited. And waited. As the passage of time became increasingly irritating, we noticed that very few people had food at their tables. Other than a large crowd standing at the bar, most of the tables were empty. I heard the lady at the table behind us complain to her server about the slowness of the food service. Her party eventually left without eating. When another couple at a nearby table finally got food, we heard them tell the server their order was wrong, but they would eat it anyway as they had waited long enough. Other waitresses passing by remarked to us, and seemed stunned, that we had still not yet received our dinners.  Over the next 45 minutes, we stopped our server several times to ask about our food. She kept saying she would check on it, and offered an excuse that they \"share the kitchen with another restaurant.\" Eventually our appetizer of mozzarella sticks arrived, with the promise of the rest soon. About 15 minutes later, the Fish & Chips platters that my wife and I ordered arrived, along the sides of fries that our son and our friend ordered. However, they did not get their main food at this time. Again, we flagged down the waitress to inquire, only to be told she had no idea when the rest of the meal would come out, and could not even promise us that the food would arrive at all.  Eventually the chicken wings ordered by our friend were delivered. They were barely warm, and the extra Blue Cheese dressing requested (and charged for) was never delivered. Neither was the supposed included ranch dressing for dipping. Two more times I inquired about my son's order of chicken tenders, and again no answer was available. We'd now been in the restaurant for an hour and a half. We had get going to make the activity across the street, so I asked the waitress for our check, and to speak with a manager. After she passed by a few more times, I again asked for our check. A few minutes later, I flagged down another server and asked again for the manager. It was at this time that a patron who had been standing at the bar when we arrived told us he ordered food before we sat down and had still not received it.  Eventually I spoke to a manager, while my family ran across the street to check in at the gate before the deadline to keep from losing our seats. The manager ended up comping the two cold sides of fries, and gave another discount that covered most of the Fish & Chips dinners. However, that did little to assuage the after-dinner mood. We did not eat full meals, the food we did get was at best lukewarm, and we had to rush to get to our seats at the Evening Parade.  Our evening at Molly Malone's was a great disappointment. From the time we were seated, to the time we left, very little was done right. It was notable how empty the restaurant was, other than the groups drinking at the bar. Perhaps that should have been a hint to us of things to come. We were let down by a place we had enjoyed many times in the past, and we will not return in the future. There are plenty of other dining establishments along \"Barracks Row.\" Next time, we'll try someplace else.",

The location is fantastic, in the Barracks Row / Eastern Market neighborhood, it's a couple of blocks from the metro. It's also not to far, at least by my standards but i could see it being a hike for others, from both RFK and Nats Park. So even if you don't pick this place you have plenty of choices in the neighborhood. Second, i was surprised with the beer list at the location. Going in and being an Irish themed restaurant, i expected the standard Guinness, Harp, Bass, some cider like Strongbow or Mangers, and your macro brew on tap. Well i was wrong. The have 50 different taps and some good stuff on top of it. I mean when you have 90 min Dogfish IPA on tap, well yeah. I went with the Boulevard Lot 7 (out of KC) . The bottle list isn't anything to laugh at either. Also grabbed a meal while i was their, and it was fantastic. Fish (Haddock) and Chips. The Chips were the run of the miil types, nothing special. The Fish however, fantastic. A nice fluffy and not overly crispy or soggy batter coating, with a well flaky and tasty fish. Complemented with a very good tartar sauce. Was also surprised at the quickness that it was brought out after ordering.  Now with all this i could have easily given Molly Malone's a four or five star review, could of, but one thing. The service. This was a sunday early evening, around 4:30 - 5pm, not long after an event at RFK. But going in they wen't crowded (a nice crowd was their and increased by the time i left) nor did they seem that busy. Sitting at the bar it took nearly 5 mins, if not more, before i was even acknowledged. This is with bartenders walking back and forth behind the bar. I mean at least tell me that you notice me and that you'll be with me shortly. This seemed to be a constant thing during the whole time i was their. I could understand if their were a ton of drinks being poured, but i didn't notice that. Needless to say with the exception of the quick serving of the food, the service was sub par. It was friendly, but it just seemed that the bartenders were distracted or something.  Now i am not willing to write of Molly Malone's Just yet and i hope this is just an isolated incident. Willing to give it a try again.",
