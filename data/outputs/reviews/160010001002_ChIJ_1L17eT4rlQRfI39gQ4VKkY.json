Starter was Caesar Salad which had the perfect components, temperature, and textures -- wonderful!  For entrees, my wife chose the Filet and I selected the Salmon -- both delicious!  [The manager warned everyone ahead of time that the plates would be hot. They were.]  The Salmon was served over sauteed spinach and was prepared with a tasty sauce.  Accompaniments were Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Broccoli, which were served family style to our table consisting of 2 couples.  Taste was very good; but these side dishes could have been warmer. Dessert was Chocolate Cheesecake with fresh berries -- fabulous! Overall, we enjoyed our dinner very much!  [And the seminar speaker shared useful retirement planning information to boot.]",

I said yes, it's Theresa's 60th. They said we will be able to pick a dessert and the staff will sing happy birthday. When we got there, we were seated in the bar area. Not my first choice but oh well, food should be just as good. We were told to scan one of those qr codes to get the menu or they could bring us a paper menu. We opted for the paper menu. Our server (not sure what his name was because he didn't introduce himself) brought happy hour menus. Since we weren't there for burger and fries bar food we asked for the proper menu. We got that and ordered a couple of drinks . Mine a cognac on the rocks drink and her a lemon drop. They gave me the lemon drop and her the cognac. Ok, no big deal,  we traded our drinks. We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms for dessert. Pretty bland and tasteless.  I ordered the lobster bisque and she the tomato and bruschetta salad. Lobster bisque was good but not as good as I've had other places. The salad was not good. We then ordered the main course and we both opted for the filet mignon. Mine 11 oz and hers 8 oz. I ordered a glass of wind and she ordered another Lemon Drop. Wine was delivered to her and no Lemon Drop. I informed the waiter that the wine was for me and that she didn't get her Lemon Drop. Both Medium temperature. Got our steaks and sides. Mine was a little chewy and under cooked and lacking flavor. Hers was good.  Now for dessert. She picked the chocolate peanut butter thing which was very good. They brought it out with a candle and had \"Happy Birthday Tamara\" written in chocolate on the plate. That would have been great if her name was \"Tamara\". No one sang happy birthday which was fine with my wife. We made sure this was our dessert and told them the name was wrong. He apologized and a few minutes later, someone, I assume the manager but he also never introduced himself, brought out another plate with the correct name and a candle but managed to spell her name wrong.  It's all the little things that you expect for high end dining which make the experience. The server lacked personality and I couldn't tell you anyone's name because no one bothered to tell us. The guy in charge of filling our water glasses was the best and should be the one serving tables.  We most likely won't be back. There is a local place called Chandlers where the food and service is always impeccable (ask for Bodies table. He's great). We will stay with them when we want to splurge.",

Then, my wife and I had to wait 15 mins for bread, water and a club soda. The chopped salad was good. I ordered the crab cakes and 2 lobster tails. The crab cakes were semi fried on the outside and extremely mushy and had so much butter they were not edible.  The lobster tails were way over cooked.  My wife liked her steak. I asked the waitress to remove my salad plate and she had to get someone to do it. I guess I will have to find another place to eat, because it wasn't worth $200.",

She said she would see what she could do. She walked away to \u201ccheck the patio\u201d (that had several open tables spaced appropriately apart, 2 of the tables being occupied). I was quite stunned when she told me they were very busy and could not seat me. She also said that I could come in tomorrow for happy hour and usually find open seating or I could make a reservation for the next night. I said thanks and that we were looking for some birthday dessert and walked outside. It was Monday night, at 7:40pm...I could count the number of occupied tables in the entire restaurant on two hands. I walked away, told our group and just out of curiosity jumped online to see if they had reservations. I was denied a seating at 7:41pm and booked my reservation online at 7:45pm. More shock!!! It didn\u2019t make sense. We walked around until 7:55 and went back for our reservation and were seated. In passing the hostess area I asked if they were only accepting online reservations as I was just in here, denied and then booked online. The woman froze and grasped for words, \u201cwe were very busy at that time\u201d \u201cwe hold tables for reservations\u201d and \u201cwe would have to ask walk ins to leave to accommodate our reservations\u201d. While seated only one other table showed up for seating. I also felt like from where I sat that they were talking and referencing our table to two other staff (could just be my paranoia)...it tainted our whole experience. It\u2019s a bummer, I enjoy the ambience, their wine list and their cheesecake, but I won\u2019t be dining here again. And I won\u2019t be recommending it to others.",

Food was awesome, steak was slightly overcooked and one of the team members overheard my brother and I talking about it. We insisted they not re-make it(even a slightly over-cooked steak at Ruth's Chris is amazing), but they insisted that it needed to be perfect. They remade the steaks, brought out some sides to fill us up even more. Camden, our server went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of. Food was delicious and service was top notch. We left way to full and very happy with our visit. We have been there before and will continue to visit when we want the best steak and best service I have found in my 35 plus years living here.

It was purple and extremely slimy. I did get it fixed, and it tasted great after. Martinis were some of the best I've ever had.

We also had the portabello mushrooms and the roasted brussel sprouts. For dessert we had the house made cheesecake. All was top notch including the service.  This was our 36 year anniversary dinner. Well done Ruth's Crist.  This is a must do if you come near Boise.",

If  you look at the price alone, you would think Gordon Ramsay is cooking for you, or someone similar. If you look at the food alone, you would think it's cheaper. This place is waaay too overpriced. Just looking at the food, its good, don't get me wrong, but what I experienced is not worth the money I spent. For 2 people, it was around $250, but the food here ain't worth around $250. The staff and the decor was nice at least. One of the reason we tried this fancy schmancy restaurant was because we bought a $100 dollar gift card at Costco and we never tried this restaurant. Didn't expect to spend more than double this amount, let alone get food that isn't even worth that much.  And it wasn't like we weren't dressed properly  or anything. We both wore something nice.  2 stars for good staff and good food without considering money. 3 stars deduction for overcharging for the food and potentially underperforming kitchen, esp. for a fancy restaurant.",

I decided to save it until recently for my anniversary with my Girlfriend and im honestly glad I did, but the prices still we'rent the usual \"bougie\" for it being an upper class establishment, giftcard aside we both ate for about $60 a person. That number being a lot of people's bi-weekly grocery budget it seems high. But oh my God it was worth it. The steak; Served swimming in butter and chives on a 500F plate. The softest, most tasteful steak I have ever had. Cooked Medium, the texture was life changing. The flavor about made me shed a tear. a 12oz sirloin to split with the two of us was the perfect amount including the complimentary bread and the side of mashed potatoes we got (also being the perfect share size). The drinks; we didnt have much, just water and some strawberry lemonade. The lemonade was very well priced at $4 a glass without refills. The price being very standard didnt change how great it was. It tasted fresh and was mixed well enough that i got a good taste of both lemon and strawberry.  The service; I tend to consider service above anything else while eating out, it makes or breaks the experience for me. Absolutely incredible. The staff we're upbeat, very informative about the menu options and availability. our waitress Molly, absolutely incredible. She was so kind and prompt to our needs but gave us an excellent amount of space to enjoy the evening. I hope her supervisors see this because she did an amazing job. The rest of the staff were very attentive to us too, refilling our water while just passing by. I cant imagine the stress of keeping up a standard at a place like this but they were so good to us.  $60 a head is something i wont be doing very often, but the price is worth the experience of the incredible food, service and the upbeat yet relaxed environment. Fantastic job everyone!",

I had the chef special rib eye that came with mashed potatoes or creamed spinach, a salad, and a dessert. It was priced at $59.00 and is a special early menu available until 6:30pm. The Caesar salad I had was so delightful. It was dressed perfectly with fresh shaved Parmesan. I skipped the anchovies. My rib eye seemed to be about 6 ounces, cooked and flavored perfectly, and the spinach was scrumptious. The rest of the table ordered ala carte with family size sides. That was a bit more expensive yet larger portions than my dinner. Filet that melted in our mouths, sea bass that was buttery and light, eye rolling to die for mushrooms, rich creamy Idaho mashed potatoes, and the yams were something special too, yet for the sweet tooth. They were topped with brown sugar and pecans. Very tasty and the table loved them but too sweet for me. My dessert was a flour-less chocolate cake and we opted for the cheesecake too. Dessert was fine and on the less sweet side so that was a pleasant ending. Extensive wine list and menu. Very satisfied with Ruth Chris!",

The service was good. My water glass was only dry for short periods of time.  They were quick to deliver the food and setup for dessert.  The meal I had was a Caesar salad, with a filet, steamed broccoli, and potatoes au gratin, with a chocolate torte for dessert.  The Caesar salad was perfect, the potatoes were undercooked, and the filet was not medium as they stated it should have been.  It was more medium well/well. I feel like I could've done much better. The broccoli was good, but decided against the hollandaise sauce after only a few bites.  The chocolate torte was super delicious.  So the meal started well and ended well.  For the price. I think they got too much wrong though to give more than 3 Stars.  I hope to go back some day and try a fish option.  That will decide if I ever go back.",

The atmosphere was elegant and fancy, and the steak, wow, it was so delicious and practically melted in my mouth. The food was so good it made the back of my eyeballs sweat! Even something as simple as a baked potato was awesome in flavor and presentation. Yes, the prices are very high, and it appeared the menu items were \u00e0 la carte, Our budget doesn't allow us to dine there frequently, but we will certainly be back soon.",

When we complained, the manager seemed surprised and said the steak was good (really, he just knew because he had not tasted it) & offered to bring us a new steak. By then we didn't want a steak anymore so they packaged up the bad steak for my dogs (unsure if I should give the bad steak) & charged me ~$90 for a inedible steak.

        "caption": "The entree prices here are OD expensive, but the Happy Hour (4:30 - 6:30) is FANTASTIC, which is what this review will be based on. The restaurant opens at 4:30, however if you get there a little early, the door is open for you to wait in the main lobby. I read another review where someone mentioned to get here early since there might be a line and you\u2019d have a chance of missing out on the Happy Hour (since it\u2019s ONLY held in the Bar area, which is actually very spacious and consists of the long bar counter AND the tables / booths surrounding it), but to my surprise there were only 5 other people ahead of us. What my party did was pre game a little at Lucky Fins prior to coming here, mainly due to how cold it was outside. In warmer weather you can just walk around downtown until the place opens (Freak Alley is a MUST for out of towners).  The food here was impressive, especially to someone who doesn\u2019t eat at these fancy restaurants (yes, I DEFF consider this place fancy / high end). I tried a couple of the HH menu items (Prime Bleu Cheese Bacon Burger, Grilled Tenderloin Salad, Ruth\u2019s Tenderloin Sliders), and the stand outs to me were the Prime Bleu Burger and the Tenderloin Salad. The burger was soft and filling, and the salad had lightly grilled steak (medium rare maybe, idk they didn\u2019t ask how we wanted the meat done). But damn, I never had steak like that before, even if it was a small(ish) portion (which the amazing taste made up for). If you come here for the HH, my recommendation would be to get the salad first, and THEN get that Bleu Burger. At $9 each, that\u2019s a helluva 1-2 combo, trust me. The sliders were alright, but I\u2019d skip them, mainly due to the bang for buck value (#brokeboyz). If I HAD to pick a negative, I\u2019d say I would\u2019ve liked the fries crispier, but they were still tasty AF.  I also tried a handful of the drinks (Pomegranate Martini, Classic Cosmo, Ruth\u2019s Manhattan, Gin Basil Smash), and the stand out to me was the Ruth\u2019s Manhattan, which had a strong taste that I loved (my kind of \u201cheater\u201d to use when trying to warm up on a cold day). The Gin Basil came in second, it\u2019s refreshing and would go great on a summer hot day. The ladies will LOVE the first two (Martini & Cosmo), both are \u201cgirly\u201d drinks, but still tasty (JUDGE ME FAM, I LIKED THEM TOO).  Finally, the atmosphere / vibe in here is businessy (meaning most people here are dressed up and not wearing a tshirt and shorts), so I\u2019d recommend putting a little effort into looking nice when coming here, just so you don\u2019t stand out, and make it look like you eat at these baller places on the regular. Dining areas (Bar area and the main dining areas) were clean and tidy, bathrooms were nice. Service (the fine ladies greeting us, our waiter, the servers), were all professional. You can really tell the difference in overall service & presentations when comparing this place to other restaurants / steak houses (Texas Roadhouse, Outback, etc). I was surprised to find out this was a chain restaurant, it felt so unique to me.  In conclusion, this is a straight up 5 for me. I feel like their Happy Hour menu was very fair when taking into consideration the food presentation, quality of food / taste, and the premium atmosphere. If this is your first time coming, I\u2019d highly recommend coming during HH, just to get a feel for the food / vibe and not break the bank. After coming here for my first time and having such a positive experience, it really makes me curious to try their full price entrees, which is exactly what the goal of a Happy Hour for a business is. If a $9 burger was one of (if not the best) burgers I\u2019ve ever had, you better believe their real menu items have GOT to be GAF. I\u2019m picky when giving out 5 stars, but this is one of a few places that I believe is a 5 all day.  *BROKE BOYZ* Secret: Costco sells $100 gift card to this place for $80. Copping that & coming to Happy Hour almost feels like a cheat code.",

Such a beautiful restaurant,  such professional service and excellent food.  Patrons should be more respectful and the dress code, which we checked online before we made a reservation for a very special occasion,  should be enforced.  Loved , loved this restaurant. We will be here again, just hope the dress code is enforced.  Too nice of a restaurant to have folks looking so slovenly. The staff and service, and food deserve better.",

I'd take a cheap sirloin from a charcoal grill over a top tier oven broiled cut any day. The salad seemed to have been designed chiefly for aesthetics, with dry lettuce and arugula overwhelming the flavor of the dressing, pecans, and blue cheese crumbles. The lobster mac & cheese was the best I've had, thanks to the chili peppers, I suppose, and it complimented the steak very well.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was perfect for a night out with friends. Our booth was comfortable and felt reasonably secluded. There is an inescapable franchise feel to the place and the menu, however. I know that's important sometimes, especially when traveling, but this is my home town. For this kind of money there are plenty of other places with good atmosphere and better food.",

We were celebrating my daughter\u2018s birthday and they did absolutely nothing to make it special for her other than telling her happy birthday when we walked in the door.   I had seen pictures of  birthday desserts for other customers  were they had written happy birthday on the plate and the presentation was actually quite nice so I thought they would make her night special however we ordered dessert for her and it came just like everyone else\u2019s!   Not even a happy birthday sentiment when they delivered it to her.  Most of the staff was not what you would expect for a high-end restaurant.   Our waiter in particular was over-the-top at times and underwhelming at other times.    He joked around a lot but didn\u2019t really have any answers to questions we presented him with .  The secondary waiter actually left dirty silverware on the table even though I put it on my plate for him to take away,  seriously...if we\u2019re going to spend $375 on dinner for three people can we  at least get some clean silverware?  The presentation of the food was the most disappointing part of the entire evening,  you would expect a $66 fillet to be presented with some class however they sent it out on a white appetizer platter with absolutely no presentation whatsoever.   Even a sprig of rosemary or thyme would have made it look a little bit more appealing!

It is in the middle of town, so you will have to pay for parking.  I was a bit surprised on the prices. I figured it must be amazing. Unfortunately my expectations were too high. The portions were large. But quantity over quality is not always ideal.  They had a table ready for us with a card that said happy anniversary, and some rose petals on the table. Anyone that came to our table said happy anniversary. That was super nice.  everything is ala carte, which also surprised me. I figured with the prices, it would come with two sides. lol. They bring bread for the table. Which wasn't all that great. Just basic French bread.  I got the New York strip steak. 16 oz. I asked for it well done. It still had a little pink to it, but I just ate it instead of sending it back. The flavor was pretty good.  The sides are big enough for two. So we shared. We got the sweet potato casserole. It did not have a lot of flavor, I was a bit disappointed in it. Quite dry. Needs lots more butter. we got the scalloped potatoes, which were so Bland. There's a thin layer cheese on top and that's it. I didn't even want to eat that. We also got the brussel sprouts which were actually pretty good. I would have to say those were my favorite.  My husband got the ribeye, which was really good. He added the lobster for $25. Quite a waste of money. He did not enjoy it at all. It was just basic and didn't have a great flavor.  For our meals and three cocktails, it was just over $200. Not a huge deal if the food is amazing. But their price tags and the quality of food don't match.  Our server was nice. But she would disappear for quite long periods. She had been gone so long we forgot who our server was, and ordered something from someone that wasn't our server, who seems a bit irritated. after we finished eating, We sat there for about 20 minutes until she brought the bill.  There was another guy, who was a server for the tables around us. We wish we had gotten him. He was very attentive to his tables and very bubbly and outgoing. our server was friendly but basic and we only seen her 3 times. We found ourselves constantly looking around for her, and just asking random staff for things we needed.  They let us pick out a free dessert for our anniversary. We picked the key lime pie. It was pretty good. Wasn't a terrible experience, but we were going back and forth between two places. I wish we had picked the other.",

Barely cooked, tough, bitter, fibery...   Bearnaise sauce iffy too :-(    8 spears of raw asparagus for $11.00.  We ate very little of it.  A bit of a gyp.   The dessert was quite nice, and with an anniversary message on the plate.   Worth the cost?  Mmmmm.... probably not.  If everything had been spot on, I would have probably done 5 stars.   For the price, everything SHOULD have been spot on.  Oh yes.... guards for the splattering steak plates would have saved my blouse.",
