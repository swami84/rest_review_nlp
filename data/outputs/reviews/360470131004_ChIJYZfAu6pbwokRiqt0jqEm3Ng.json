My mom and I just shared a few plates, the quesadilla, kale salad and then the fried chicken with yucca. All of them were delicious and filling. Quesadilla is an appetizer but pretty big for the portion. Fried chicken was tasty and perfectly crisped.  Got the strawberry crisp for dessert and was 100% satisfied with my choice. The waiter gave me his recommendation and I was very happy about it. He was also very kind I wish I got his name he was so sweet!!!",

A couple of tables inside. If you use a credit card, there's a small fee (stated on the menu), which I'm surprised to see.  So it's $21 for all the brunch dishes, which comes with a choice of non alcoholic drinks. I ordered the pupusa dish and it was really good, but it was small. They give you two palm size pieces with beans, guacamole, and slaw. I was still hungry afterwards. My friends that ordered the egg dishes are filling. Another friend ordered the french toast and it was pretty big, but her husband got the fish and grits and that was really small. Also doesn't seem like there's a free refill for coffee since they never offered. So the conclusion is that my dish wasn't worth it, since I had to go somewhere else to fill up my poor stomach.",

His menu changes often and the offers are so impressive. He knows how to balance flavors with unique twists. We nearly ordered every appetizer on the menu, along with a pitcher of sangria. The entrees were delicious - the tuna entree substituted for swordfish was flavorful, the crispy chicken-styled entree was a high end twist to batter wings and the plantain coconut dish (first on the entree menu) was impressive in presentation - literally in a coconut shell- and in its flavor. I know I butchered the names on the menu... nevertheless, you cannot go wrong with ordering anything here. The friendly ambiance will nurture your food baby to good health by the time you leave. 5+ stars.",

Honestly, I have no idea why they are charging so little. That could have easily been 100 dollars and would be totally reasonable even at that price.

We came here for a bachelorette brunch on a Saturday and they were gracious and flexible when we had two people not show up for our larger reservation. We ordered a bunch of drinks including coffee (decent), mimosas (pretty good) as well as a nice array of their brunch items such as the french toast (fluffy and sweet), the pork hash and eggs (delicious -- the slaw added a real freshness to the fatty, gooey dish), and the chilaquiles (yummy but could be spicier). Since our entrees took a good while to come out, they also offered us a champagne toast, an avocado ceviche on the house, and several desserts to round out the meal. Come here and expect awesome service, and although you might be waiting a while for your actual food it's such a fun and delicious time you probably won't notice!  (Value is great as well: $200 post tax and tip for 7 people with entrees and multiple drinks.)",

They have one table and a couple of chairs outside- the inside is a little dark, but its big and doesn't feel cramped. The decor is cute! and I love wooden tables and chairs, which is what they have. They also have glittery skull lamps in the window which are cool.  I tried the Prix Fixe which comes with tea/coffee or mimosa/bloody and I had the Huevos Ba\u00f1ados. I highly recommend this, comes on texas toast and all the yummy sauce gets into the bread making it amazing. I will say that the food took time to come to the table, but the service was good, and quick. You get free refills on the coffee and an extra mimosa is $1- great deal!  I will be back for sure",

But sometimes, like in the case of Palo Santo, those expectations are more than met.  My friend and I had dinner here on Tuesday evening and everything about the experience was lovely. I made a reservation because I know it\u2019s a smaller restaurant (especially when it\u2019s too cold to make use of their outdoor seating) but I believe we wouldn\u2019t have had a problem even if we just walked in, as there were tables available (but it *was* early on a Tuesday).  The restaurant is small and warm and inviting. The service was really good & the staff was also genuine and warm and kind. They have a great happy hour option of a free empanada (or taco) with purchase of an alcoholic drink. My friend ordered a sparkling wine & opted for the beef empanda. I don\u2019t drink, however our server brought me their potato and cheese empanda anyway so we could try both. It was hot and crisp delicious. [Plus their happy hour runs from 6-10pm (M-Th) which is really generous]  I ordered a hearts of palm salad, with avocado pistachios cilantro & mango. It was light and tart and delicious. The portion was also huge. My friend and I shared it & still had enough leftover for both of us to take some home. For my entree I had the fish tacos which were simple and delicous as well. A touch on the saltier side, but nothing that turned me off them. My friend opted for the steak, which was another generous portion. They enjoyed it & I now wish I had tried a bite.  Everyone raves about two things at Palo Santo, the homemade tortillas and the homemade hot sauce. Both were stellar and definitely lived up to the hype. I\u2019d be happy eating both any time.  I had a great evening (with great company which always helps too) and will definitely return!",

We agreed and were generously offered a glass of sparkling sangria.  We placed our order and waited for 50 minutes. During that wait time, we didn't get utensils or dishes. When we asked our waiter why we weren't getting utensils, he sneered. When we called the maitre to ask about our food, we were invited to leave if we couldn't be patient. We were very polite about the whole thing and left.  Must say, why come to this restaurant to be mistreated?  There are many good restaurants in Park Slope with better service.",

The interior is quaint with wood and comfortable and plenty of locals. The host was friendly as was the server.  The brunch menu was limited but enough selection to make everyone happy. We had the Bluefish Ceviche, Papaya salad and the egg/bacon sandwich. The ceviche was quite good. Great flavors and the papaya was firm and sweet with the slightly spicy watercrest. The egg/bacon sandwich was what it was but equally as good served with yucca fries and spicy mayo dipping sauce.  We certainly enjoy the meal and looking at the dinner menu, it looked just as good. But the let down was for the price and amount it left us wanting a little bit more in way of portions.",

I noticed  on their website the opportunity to rent half the space or the entire venue. The pictures of palo santo on their website do not do any justice compared to visiting the space. I felt in love with the intimate feel of the brick wall and the nostalgic pieces hung around the venue. The space transforms from the day to a bright open space with the natural lighting and at night the lights are dim to give a romantic feel. The food is adjusted on a daily basis. You cannot go wrong with any item on the menu.  It has been nearly a year since my wedding and our friends and family are still mentioning how memorable the food, service and the environment was. I highly recommend Palo Santo for any events or simply to enjoy a great meal.",

The food is more adventurous, experimental, and different than most other restaurants in the Slope so do yourself a favor and look at the menu before you go to see if it suits your appetite.

A few years ago it was an incredible bargain and even better experience at $50 (plus $40 wine pairings). Overall a great restaurant and I'd argue that it is closer to $$ than the $$$ that the magazine lists.

My girlfriend and I ordered the ceviche and each got two small bites of soupy fish and few sprigs of celantro for $14. This was, by far, the most expensive ceviche I've ever eaten, and no where near the best. I've never had my ceviche swimming in the marinade sauce, which was  probably supposed to fill-out the dish and make it look larger. It was really pathetic. If you want to get some great food for a good price, this is a poor choice.",
