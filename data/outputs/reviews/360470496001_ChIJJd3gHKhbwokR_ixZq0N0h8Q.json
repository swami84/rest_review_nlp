Staff was very courteous, wearing masks at all times, giving helpful suggestions. Very cute decor featuring local designs. Definitely brings me back to traveling in Chiang Mai. They respected covid guidelines with limited seating, about 3-4 tables a good distance apart. All tables had hand sanitizers and were properly cleaned by staff in between.  Their food. Mouth watering delicious! Honestly, we couldn't decide on one thing and over ordered by getting 3-4 dishes. Everything was a homerun! Authentic flavors. -Thai iced tea. -Thai farm kitchen Pad Thai with a side of shrimp and calamari. -Massaman look Kae. That coconut sauce was delicious. Lamb was fall off the bone. -Pad Krapow. Ground pork with rice topped with fried egg. Really really good. We ordered another to go!  Left full and satisfied. Big portions, guaranteed leftovers. Will continue to support this place!",

I called to cancel it right away (unfortunately, you don't get a delivery time until after an order is placed) and they assured me that it will only take 50 minutes max.  Of course the time flies by and after not receiving anything, I call over an hour later and if course they gave me story that it is on its way.  Now, they claim they can't cancel it and made it seem like I'm causing them a major disservice ( it's already an hour and twenty minutes and I have no food).  No apologies.  They can't take the responsibility to call someone that they are running late or anything.  I wish I could give them no stars.",

Both of the dishes we got were plentiful, well-balanced, and very fresh. The iced tea with milk was perfect... I find a lot of places put a ton of sugar in it which makes it undrinkable, but here it was just right, I could drink 3 of them in a row they were so amazing. The lemon tea was also very refreshing. I LOVE the many vegan options and how committed they seem to the community. My boyfriend and I laugh and say we're officially farm people now. Their restaurant looks beautiful and exciting, I really want to experience their food on location. Definitely going to order from here again (from their website so they get the profit instead of the leeching delivery websites) and I look forward to going to Thai Farm Kitchen in person!",

They are giving free meals to the less fortunate during this hard time in the community which honestly doesn't surprise me these people are just that humble and loving. All employees are in masks and gloves with a plastic divider and table to pass food along with some hand sanitizer on the table aswell. No one in there was not in a mask or gloves including the chefs. These businesses support us when we're up and I have to say how pleased I was to support them when they're down and feel as comfortable as I did leaving because naturally we're all nervous. I love this place in general but have an added respect after seeing their community initiative and thankfulness for my business during this tough time.  Food is always top notch I don't even need to comment. It's always on point it's the best thai in the area and I drive 20 minutes for it no lies. I don't write reviews on google but heavily rely on them. I just finished my meal and absolutely needed to review. Thanks!",

They emphasize the healthy side here with more fresh and crisp vegetables than at other Thai restaurants we've been to. The pork laab appetizer is very tasty and has a bit of a kick. Pad Thai was really good. The only negative was that the Panang curry could have been richer and spicier,  theirs was a bit watery. Making up for it though was the delicious dessert of taro, coconut and pumpkin. Best of all was their spectacularly good ice coffee with milk: I want a glass every morning for the rest of my life!",

I lived here for many years before moving and if this was here when I was, I would have earned the title of most frequent customer.  Food is fresh and authentic. Not too many seats but honestly who cares.  Price is a touch on the high side but I'm sure the neighborhood is changing and is driving those prices. I have no issues with it personally, especially given the organic farm to table approach.  I will be back to sample more of the menu.",

With two Golden dragons outside, you feel like transported to an other place. In side you will see the open kitchen and smell the food being made. It is lunch hour on a Sunday but pretty empty. I recommend the window table. This is perfect for a date and not for more than 4 people.  With real fork and spoon, I felt like having fine dining here. I actually like their utensil better. Service is really good. Lemon water and menu given to us right after we settle down. There is your five star service.  The best part is the food. I was a bit up sad that their lunch special only apply for weekday. I kinda want to try everything here but we got papaya salad and green curry. Food is 100% and presentation is even better.  Definitely do trek out here for a try.",

The food was pretty tasty and the portions were fair. I got the Pad Krapow which consisted of rice with stir fried ground pork (also available with chicken) and a perfectly fried egg. It was slightly spicy but not overly so, just overall a great dish. I got the hot tea which was really flavorful.  Service is great and everyone was very friendly. Prices are slightly high but I would say cheaper than comparable Thai restaurants. I would definitely say this is a two dollar sign place rather than one dollar sign as Google Maps shows.",

I came with high expectations and wasn't let down!  The waitress was friendly and the owner (I think) came to check up on me as well which was nice. My service was quick! I my Thai ice tea came out quickly followed shortly by my Tom yum soup. My ice tea was great and my soup was flavorful (although I wish it had a bit more spice).  The menu here isn't typically what you would find in an American Thai restaurant, most of the menu was actually quite foreign to me, I decided to try outside my comfort zone. I don't usually like Thai curries because of the overwhelming taste of coconut but I thought my entree was phenomenal (also beautifully presented) , I ordered the green curry with chicken and there was a good balance of cocunut and the other flavors. I actually gulfed down the remaining curry like soup after finishing the chicken with white rice.  To sum it up. In my experience good food and service. Price for dinner felt a little steep around $30 for one person. I'll be back to try some other things regardless though.",

The owner, Jess, came over and greeted us and was very friendly, sharing stories of his life in Thailand as a farmer/restaurateur and educator in agricultural studies.  It is obvious he has a passion for real Thai food culture and wants to share it with his customers.  Hope Thai Farm Kitchen is around for a long time.  Good luck, Jess!",
