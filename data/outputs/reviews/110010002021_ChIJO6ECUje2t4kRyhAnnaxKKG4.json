The orecchiette tasted like box pasta (?) and not home made so when I see \"fresh pasta\" on the menu I'm expecting irregularly shaped ear pasta.  TARTE CHAUDE AU CHOCOLAT - $10 *definitely would not recommend this chocolate tarte, it was stale tasting and the chocolate was very dry *I ended up taking it home because I didn't want to waste $10 but I probably won't eat it ha *This should not have been served and removed from my check  SERVICE: -Minimal considering it was 5:30 pm when they opened and only 3 tables total when dining there for less than an hour. -Also I was irritated that specials were offered to the other 2 tables but not mine.  I heard Gazpacho soup, duck confit and another dish...after I ordered both my appetizer and entree.  Two thumbs down!",

The food here was excellent, cooked perfectly and served very nicely. The portions are fine overall, maybe a little less then other places, but they make up for it in the taste. The price can be a bit steep here when you add in drinks, so do tread cautiously. After dinner we went up to the lunge where they had a live musician playing jazz, which was very relaxing and nice right after our meal. Would recommend checking out this small spot in Northern Georgetown.",

The food was delicious, and the quantities we're generous (for French food). Meaning that you probably aren't walking out with a take home bag, but you aren't looking at a plate of design instead of substance.  But the food is designed, and cooked and prepped with care. You can tell the sauces are simmered and reduced, and the meats are fall off the bone.  Wine pairings recommended were great and not too expensive.  If I ever have guests who want to eat French, or if I just want good food, I'm making a trip here.  To put it easily... Filomena is to Italian what Bistro Lepic is to French.  Nice servers too!",

Rather than crisp, the crabs were served soggy over a small scoop of spinach cooked sometime earlier in the day.  Pork served without imagination other than a scoop of mushrooms, mashed potatoes and sauce. Let's be honest ... the restaurant used to be a strong 4-stars, never 5.  Today, a single star is a gift.",

However: It was Restaurant Week in DC: the Bistro was packed and the three courses of the menu were served with a speed that would make any fast food chain proud. Once you had finished your course, two seconds later your plate was removed even if others at the table were still eating. And a couple of minutes after  all of us had finished, the next course would be served. The whole dinner for the party of four lasted slightly more than an hour and we felt rushed through our wine and the whole menu so that the table could be used again. On a cold and busy winter day - like the day we went - you are exposed to a lot of cold air when you sit next to the door which is very displeasing. Next time we know in advance and order another table.  Yes, we will go there again and give it another try as the food was excellent. We hope that this speed-feeding-attitude was really caused by the extraordinary conditions of Restaurant Week in DC.",

Not recommended for lovers of expensive meats and potatoes. Excellent value for money, especially for the US capital! One tip however: if the chef is not there, do not go out of the map, do not ask for a \"dish of the day\". Upstairs, sofas, you have a drink or enjoy a meal with one or two jazzmen who come twice a week.

Old style but not stodgy, done with exacting care and impeccable taste. No new ground broken here, but why kick when the Lobster Bisque tastes as fresh as on the boardwalk in Marseilles, the escargot balanced with a perfect parsley and garlic butter sauce, the Rockfish nicely seared on a bed of spinach. Polite, proper and delicious.",
