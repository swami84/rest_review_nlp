I can't figure out why they took away croquetas de jamon, making croquetas obligatorily a mix of jamon/mejillones. It was still ok, and everything else we had was good, but just seems like this place makes changes for the sake of change sometimes. And I have never seen ham mixed with mussels in a croquette, having been to Spain well over a dozen times, sometimes for months at a time.  I have seen one or the other, but never both in the same croquette. Prices have also gone up considerably over the years (well beyond inflation). And on top of that, they now have a 3.5 percent charge for using a credit card. Finally, the wines by the glass dont even include a Ribera del Duero option. Overall, still a solid spot for dinner... for now.  Hopefully they won't try to do \"too much\" with this place.  I don't think they realize that many people come here for solid, authentic tasting Spanish food.  If this place ever becomes a doppleganger of Porto, I won't be back.  I think Chef Marcos has a good concept with Porto, but this place should not become anything resembling porto or I fear Mama Delia will experience gradually increasing customer attrition. Don't forget your loyal Black Bull customer base. With that said, I look forward to my next meal here. I'm just not sure how much longer I can justify coming here if it ends up straying too far from its roots.  I used to recommend this to anyone looking for the BEST Spanish food in Chicago. It's becoming a harder sell every year although I still think it narrowly holds onto the title.",

The star dishes in my opinion are the octopus with potatoes, scallops with jamon, paella with shrimp, and the gin and tonics. My only recommendation is to include more veggie based dishes. For example, I love eggplant with honey or even a take on the spanish omlette would be nice. There absolutely needs to be Spanish olives and cheeses (manchego would be an easy one) to go with the jamon dishes. Finally, if this is truly tapas style, dishes need to be made to accommodate groups. The muffulata, for example, is cut in two. There were three of us and so we had to cut it up ourselves in order to share.",

I consider Black Bull now Mama Delia on Division St the place to go for a drink or dinner after work\u2026 Or else, yeah! The  special spot in the city to bring your family and friends on a weekend gathering celebration. When I saw the restoration being done in June I said: Oh well\u2026 another of my favorites is closing\u2026gone! Black Bull survived the tough years after the Great Recession, but not the pandemia. I am sad\u201d. But hey!!! surprise! I heard\u2026 \u201cNo, it\u2019s not totally gone, it\u2019s just an upgrade, it\u2019s same owner with a more fabulous Spanish menu, it has now a pink wall instead of the black facade and a pretty name. That\u2019s all!\u201c I was relieved, I very much love the diversity in the area and the Spanish food brings enough to me. Here is the point, I liked Black Bull not only because of the menu, but because, it was very welcoming, very friendly, fantastic service and happy servers, the environment was excellent, the managing was caring and awesome even in the slowest days like on a Wednesday night. Now we have a very sophisticated place and suitable and appealing menu\u2026 good food for sure $$$$$$$ yikes! However, last night... Wednesday... my experience with Mama Delia was of a very unwelcoming staff, boring, sad, low energy\u2026 I say unhappy environment. Oh come on\u2026 Owner think of this\u2026 Where\u2019s the inspiration now? You don\u2019t brand a restaurant on a concept and ambiance only, you brand it mainly on your customer service and satisfaction. In other words, on customer happiness and loyalty. Last night, was probably not the night to visit you, but coming from work on a beautiful summer night and since you\u2019re on my way home, I stopped by\u2026 but I wish I wouldn\u2019t have done it, because, I found myself now taking the time to write this review. People, weekends are probably better to visit Mama Delia since during the week it may not be the best experience. I want to be fair, so I\u2019d mention from my previous visits in July and August chef Antonio and mixologist Ricky are great ;) good customer care and satisfaction. At least someone cares!",

We weren't seated until 30 minutes after our reservation, then no one came to our table for another 20 minutes. So basically an hour after our reservation we finally got our drink order taken. From then on it was great, but the delay but us in a bad mood for the rest of dinner.",
