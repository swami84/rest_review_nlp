Seriously! If they could have just warned us when they were taking our order that it would take sometime to prepare, I wouldn't be as mad and frustrated as I was. To top that, the ppl working there didn't seem to be really bothered by the fact the customers were unhappy. It was like they were doing us a favor. The three corn dogs that we managed to eat were sub-par at best. This place doesn't deserve any stars. Totally ruined that day of our trip!",

All the side dishes (raddish kimchi, kimchi and etc) are no longer free and comes with the meal. Its almost $5 if you want to order one. WHAT?

It also came with banchan which were all disgusting and tasted like they had been dug out of a cellar. There were 4 items on the banchan (which they sell separately for $5): stale pickled radish which compressed as you bit into it, stale fish tofu which tasted like dessicated sticks of gum, boiled bean sprouts, and old watery kimchi.  The only good dish was the spicy squid, but my friend found a long hair in his rice.  Service: nonexistent, as expected from a self serve place. I happened to tip $6 accidentally. When I asked for water, they told me they don't serve water and that I could buy a bottled water. I resorted to drinking tap water from their restroom because I was so thirsty.  Atmosphere: on the walls they had the typical kpop music videos but they didn't pay for premium so ads rolled between every few videos and created awkward silence.  tl;Dr - cheap owners, sub par food, and ok atmosphere.",
