There are no words to describe how great it taste. They cook everything fresh to order. I have yet have something we did not like. My husband ordered some strange food sometime. They are very happy to make it. I will return with alot of my coworkers back to this pizza shop. As long as they stay open we will be back year after year as long as we are still coming to town. There costumer service is outstanding. They are very friendly happy to talk to me and make sure they get my order right. Good food, good people, great store. Anyone who says different needs to try again. Maybe not at a real busy time of the day like not between 12-2 pm and not between 5-7 pm. Go before or after those times and you will see a difference.",

I called in and was put on hold for 10 minutes and ended up hanging up and calling back and was put on hold again.  When the pizza arrived the driver said he couldn't find the place and I asked him if he had my phone number and he said yes...so I asked why he didn't call...and he just walked off.  To top it off the 2 XL pizza's were cold by the time it was delivered and we just ended up throwing it away.  I tried reaching out to Basil's Pizza after the Delivery but I was put on hold again for more than 10 minutes.  Really hope they improve",

After an hour we called to find out were our food was. Person on the phone told us our food had just finished. They hadnt even sent it out for delivery yet. Mind you we had a small order nothing fancy.  They are located in the same area we are (gaithersburg) he tried telling us that the storm caused them to get very busy and they couldnt cook our order in time. The \"Storm\" he spoke of lasted all of 5 min. Nothing really adnormal for the weather we have been getting latley. we waited and waited until almost 2 hours after ordering. we ordered around 6 and didnt get our food till almost 8. Told the driver I was very upset about the food being so late and he said there was alot of traffic. we again live in the same town and I normally come home around this time so I know that was a lie. Then we open our food and find our garlic cheese bread is missing. We called to complain and all they could do was tell us they would refund us for the cheese garlic bread. I demanded some compensation for the nearly 2 hour wait and the guy tried to tell me they lost power. Hmmmm how does that make since. He told me he lost power but somehow cooked food that requies electrisity as well as told me he was looking at his computer to tell me I was wrong about how long we waited. That dosnt end it. We look in our order and find out that this Tiny little package was in fact the Cheese garlic bread we called and complained about. this \" Cheese galic Bread\" was a glorified cheese sub. I kid you not, it was sub bread you would get from a sub shop with melted cheese on it mabey 6 inches long ($4 on there menu) Worst experiance. will never order from them again",

That being said, the fries are what really set them apart from other spots. Seriously, the fries are the stars! The seasoning which has a hint of Parmesan (and other flavors), is really two steps above most fast food and/or take out fries.",

They did not offer a refund or compensation or even a simple apology for messing up my order. Always had good things to say about here and the food I have ordered, but not anymore. Will NOT be buying anything from here again simply due to the lack of customer service and customer appreciation. Thanks, but not really.  Picture: I think this looks like Gyro Meat, even though they seem to deny it.",

I waited over 2 hours for a sandwich to get delivered and when it did, the driver didn't want to come into the apartment building because he said that it was too confusing and expected me to come get it. The order was wrong, the food was cold and again...it took two hours! I will never order from this place again. And let me add, I ordered delivery because I had my son but my car wasn't working and this place is literally about a 7 - 10 minute drive from me so I don't understand why it takes over 2 hours. If there is a long delivery wait time, they should call to advise and confirm the order. Every one was very unprofessional and acted like I was an inconvenience for wanting to pay them for service. Never again!",
