Working people like me can\u2019t make it to the place by 4/5 pm. Start making sure that you have enough to serve the late evening working people that can\u2019t pull up Until 7/8pm you should not be running out of food 4 hours after you open. Again 5 times I\u2019ve  tried to catch them for a certain food, NO LUCK!!!  Please if you want oxtails after a certain time than this is not the place to go. #Respectfully",

I myself am West Indian, from Brooklyn and I\u2019ve never ordered food this spicy without caution or the option of mild and spicy, which is not offered here. My kids could not enjoy anything and my husband barely could leaving me there picking around and trying to cover up the heat in bbq sauce. When I wrote in to DoorDash they suggested I contact the restaurant so I called the number they provided me and no answer. I sent an email, no response. This was overall a very disappointing experience, I could have cooked instead of wasting my money in totality.",

They begin taking orders at 11:30a. ...I got out there at 11:20a with about 7 people in front of me and did not get my food until 12:55p.

It doesn't happen everytime but our would be wrong of me to suggest this hasn't happened. overall though, you will likely be served in a reasonable amount of time. the truck team is friendly and helpful. my photos don't do the food justice at all. the prices are a little high for food trucks but not really high for authentic Caribbean food, the servings are hearty though.

I keep coming back time after time even after being disappointed because the food is good, but you all have to do better with customer service. You all say you will be there at 11:30 but it's rarely the case, the truck may be there and that's it. You have to spend the majority of your lunch hour waiting for the food. The so-called loyalty program needs to be fixed, it should be associated with your phone number and not a card because you may not use the one card every time. And just like today my co-worker used cash and was told she couldn't be given a receipt because it wasn't on a card and she doesn't get any \"loyalty points\". Lastly, the portion size has gotten smaller but yet we still have to pay the same price. No matter how you try to word saying it's the same amount of food is a lie, an now there is a 10% charge to use a card..... all other food trucks in NOMA use the same system yet no on charges you extra to use a card. It's said when you try to support black businesses and have to deal with so much. Yes, the food is tasty, but the all-around service you receive is not worth it. I'm sure my comment will get deleted, but as a loyal customer I WILL spread the word.",

Look at her.  She referred to us folks standing in line as a mob, stating they would not serve us unless we figured out how to stand in a line.  I mean they were literally screaming at their patrons.  And there were lots of folks who had been standing in this line for a looooong time.  It's not the customer's fault that yal don't have your s*#! together.  45mins waiting on food at a taste festival is outrageous by itself.  It to not get served once we got into the front of the line is just wrong.  My son was literally crying as this lady and my husband (and yal know how my husband is-especially when he's hungry), were going back and forth.  We just left.  It ain't worth it.

In their inception, 8 can say there were some hiccups with the company, but what start up is without opportunities! This company has grown into a mainstay on Howard University's campus- known for its quality food, exceptional service, and great portion sizes.  It's unfortunate that so many of these reviews come from individuals that have seemingly never tried the food at this establishment. To post disparaging comments about a minority owned small businesss during their growth process seems to distract more than it does encourage any further development; let's uplift before we tear down. Give them another chance to turn it around for you! Definitely check it out!",
