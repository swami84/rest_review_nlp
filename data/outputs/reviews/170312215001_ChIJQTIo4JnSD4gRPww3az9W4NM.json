I haven't had the pizza in over a decade, but it was always a good tavern-style option.  Dine-in service was very attentive and helpful, honestly wasn't expecting that. They brought out bread and soup before the meal which was a nice old school touch.  The draw of the place to me, and maybe not to many others is the worn-in timewarp atmosphere of the place. It's in need of TLC and hasn't changed much in several decades. Decorated by framed oil paintings and swag lanterns, godzilla figures, old advertising signs, and cozy old booths. Families have grown up here and have nostalgia for it. Sadly many places like this are disappearing, so enjoy it while it lasts.",

We received a pizza with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers. I know we would not order a pizza with mushrooms because I am allergic to mushrooms.

The Pizza was amazing and i was only one dinning tonight and i heard good reviews about the joint and well the reviews where right it had an amazing pizza i ever had i don't know why people bother going to deep pizza when this tops all! Am not sure about the pricing thou for me it did feel little bit of expensive but hell i enjoyed half n i had other half on the go, so it was worth it. I had great conversation with Larry he's the owner i wish he keeps on going with it. I would highly recommend to any pizza lovers. Wish you all the best!

There is a waitress there who is slightly nice but shes overworked. She never has any help so if the place gets busy, shes stuck serving everyone on her own and there is only so much she can do for one table. It's unfortunate because the food here is amazing. Possibly one of the best pizza places in Chicago hands down. However, the customer service alone draws my family and I away from eating or ordering from here. Today, I attempted ordering for delivery for the very last time. Today is officially the last time I will attempt to order from this pizzeria, whether it be dining in or for delivery. The person that answered the phone was probably one of the rudest people I have ever encountered in my entire life. I have ordered for delivery from here a few times in the past. The lady was attempting to charge me a higher delivery fee than I have ever been charged. Her customer service was just extremely off. She kept hanging up the phone on us. She was cursing at my husband and I. Sorry but for as good as your food may be, its not worth being treated as a nobody.  I never would have wrote a review because of how good the food is but her approach and her customer service skills needed to be addressed.",

Had a talk to manager Quick to have all the answers on how food tasted and how it was presented to, us, the customer. A toss salad with what remained of old iceberg lettuce, with several pieces of diced tomato. Poppers which tasted like very bad freezer burn. A person from our party, decided to take a bite than threw one in garbage. Another diner took a bite and had to throw that half in garbage. 4 and half poppers, left on plate, we decided to call the restaurant. Manager had a problem when it was brought up to his attention. I explained  we never had a problem til today, Manager in his wisdom complained we had already eaten all the poppers and there would be NO refunds. Offered to refund price of salad, but that salad should have never been sent out. We took pictures, unfortunately unable to upload. Though one had to taste these items to know they were not very good. We didn't want a REFUND we wanted to know, WHY would they send out food in this condition.The manager was told the fried chicken dinners were good, never had any problems before. He took it upon himself to be condescending and accuse our party of eating all these poppers...etc and how we werent going to get a refund.... We lost our religion. Totally not worth ruining a Saturday night over, but enough to never order from there again. Hope everyone's experience will be better than ours.",

I was absolutely blown away by the flavor and texture of the wings. I had an out of body experience upon tasting these delicious things. It was like I died and went to heaven. With excellent service, great food, and an even better atmosphere you can't go wrong going here. I would recommend to anyone to stop into this amazing place.

While attempting to place my order to the lady over the phone, I was continuously put on hold without her saying \"hold please\". After a long process of me patiently waiting until she decided to take my order, I finally ordered a football size pizza and inquired if any drinks came with. She said Sierra Mist or Mountain Dew, so I asked if I could substitute with a  Pepsi instead and she said, your total is $38.02. So I asked again, could I substitute for a Coke or Pepsi, and again she said your total is $38.02. After this repetitive cycle continued for 5 rounds, I said it's ok please cancel  my order. If it wasn't in their policy to substitute, she could have just said no and I would have gladly paid the additional.  So it's 11pm and my relatives suggest ordering pizza, so  I gave John's pizza a second try to place an order and I was told they could not deliver to the address on file. I inquired why and Kimberly could not tell me why. So I asked to speak to the manager, who was in a \"meeting\" and she couldn't give me his name. I told her I would wait, 30 seconds later the meeting apparently was over. He wasn't very pleasant and told me to take my business somewhere else for canceling an order. He said me canceling the order caused him to lose money. This is puzzling to me because: 1. I cancelled the order before they made it and 2. By sending me elsewhere else he will lose money indefinitely. The way I was spoken to by every person who works there including the nameless manager did not exercise ethical practice. How hard is it to be courteous?  The management and staff should really invest in customer service and  ethics  classes to learn how to treat and serve people in their community.  A restaurant that doesn't value the QUALITY in customer service is a restaurant I don't want to eat at. Good thing I was visiting that area, never would I experience this where I live.",

Every time I have ordered delivery pizza here in Chicago (100s of deliveries), it came in a thick cardboard box that was then placed in a thermal bag which was used for transport.  John's Pizzeria Ristorante packages their delivery pizza orders in a thin paper bag (the pizza is placed on a cardboard disk).  Then the bagged pizza is placed in a cardboard box which the delivery guy uses as a carrier.  It looks like a shipping box you could get from the UPS store.  It doesn't take an engineer to figure out the pizza will cool off quickly when packaged like that.  The pizza was cold and stuck to the cardboard.  Waste of $30.  I could of ordered Dominos and gotten two medium one topping pizzas, some chicken thing and a 2 liter of Coke for $20.  While Dominos isn't the greatest pizza out there but at least warm pizza from Dominos is more enjoyable than a cold, semi chewy pizza from John's Pizzeria Ristorante. Poorly managed operation. (Also, what is with charging for crushed pepper?  You can keep corner cutting but it will all catch up with you.  Margins on pizza are high, there is no reason to corner cut so much.)",

It took them an hour and twenty minutes to deliver my order after being told it would be delivered with in the hour. Once the driver arrived I called and spoke with their kitchen manager who offered to discount my order for 9 dollars. I accepted that. Once I opened the pizza i quickly noticed it was cold. The cheese had already hardened. I called back again stated even more disappointment. They offered to send me another pizza and to have the old pizza packaged up to be returned to the driver. ( Why would I wait another hour at best so they can send me another order?) I said thats okay, you can have your driver come pick up this pizza refund my money and I'll order from another establishment. The manager said \"That's fine ill refund your money but don't EVER call here again\" SIR, WITH PLEASURE! I will never call you guys for a cold late pizza again. For a company that delivers 100's of pizzas a day you must send a lot of cold dough. Step your game up John's. This is Chicago. I can get a nice hot slice from plenty of other qualified pizzerias!",
