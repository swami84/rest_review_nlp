Usually at night I find a few of the menu items are unavailable due to lack of ingredients (I guess the positive is everything is likely fresh?). Just makes getting a favourite item un-reliable. I also wish they had a few more apps and some dessert items.",

Their vegan fried chicken is crispy and expertly seasoned, the buns are just the right amount of crunchy, and the various sauces I've had are almost impossible to adequately describe. My favorite thing on the menu is the Firebird, but honestly I think I could order an item at random off the menu here and still be delighted. There are a few sides, but the sandwiches are filling enough that you probably won't want one unless you're sharing with someone else. The drink selection is fairly minimal - a few fancy sodas, not a whole lot else. There's no desserts at all as far as I know. Prices are pretty normal for this part of Brooklyn at $13-$15 for a sandwich and $5-$7 for a side.",

I saw the little bucket of chicken tenders online and this quickly became a must-try for me. Thankfully it did not disappoint. This is honestly one of, if not THE best vegan chicken strip I've tried. If I had to compare it to something from my pre-vegans days, this was just like eating a bucket of boneless strips from KFC. The texture, crispiness and seasoning was unreal. Also they have a knack for sauces. The mondo sauce is like a thousand island house sauce (excellent). I also got the ranch with my strips (also excellent). Not liquidy in texture, very thick and flavored right with herbs. Heartbreakers is a must try.",

My crew and I order a bunch of different platters. I can\u2019t speak for their food but I had some of the the chickn\u2019 Tenders and Dynamite fries.  My initial disappointment was with the Jalope\u00f1o-cilantro aioli sauce(thought it\u2019d taste more like jalape\u00f1os or at least spicy in some way but it was bland. It seemed to be going for a cheesy appeal but fell short and was more doughy to me). The ranch one was also on the bland side. These I had ordered for my Chickn\u2019 Tenders which would have been good themselves because they had a good consistency but they were overly salted. The sauces just didn\u2019t seem to pair with the Chikn Tenders despite them having the opposite flavor issue(bland vs overly salted).  My waffle fries was smother in the same Jalope\u00f1o-cilantro aioli which made me sad. This was causing most of my waffle fries to come out soggy when they arrived to the table. Taking away any chance I could of salvage the fries to make this meal work. It was soo much sauce that it took away from the enjoyment of my fries. (If the sauce had tasted a bit better I might have not minded as much) I scrapped off most of the sauce to at least eat the waffle fries but even the ones that hadn\u2019t been sauced were soggy from the condensation of the fries above. Needless to say I didn\u2019t finish or take the fries \u201cto go\u201d though I took the chickn Tenders home to doctor up a sauce of my own that would be complimentary. It\u2019s be one thing if I was the only person that was disappointed with the food, but my crew were as well.  We need more vegan restaurant trying to make it so I do apologize if this review seems rough, however in this day and age where Vegan places are popping out of the woodwork, \u201cflavor or taste\u201d is important also. It is what should be the new definition of good vegan food versus the misconceptions of what non vegans currently believe it to be.",

Though you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've tried a good chunk of it now and it's all good! Plus the interior is cute and 70s themed. People are super nice and the food comes out pretty quickly. Love it!!!",

The chicken tenders were amazing as well. Wish I had packed my favorite hot sauce ( 718 Heat Factory Sweet Heat) with me for the tenders - will def bring it next time.",
