Despite having only water when the food arrived I had to ask for utensils. The samosa was decent but nothing special. The tikka masala tasted like spiced ketchup sauce but at least the chicken was mostly tender. The naan wasn't bad so there's that. Then someone came and cleared my table, took the glass of water, and 5 minutes later I had to ask someone to give me the check.

I called the restaurant to inform them about the situation.

Person that spoke to me did apologize but it didn't sound very sincere and he wasn't able to answer my questions which were: how could that have happened and how can restaurant assure me it's not going to happen in the future. I was told he would speak to the chef and ask and of chef says it could have happened I would get my money back. He took my name and phone number. I never got a phone call back. Next day, I emailed the restaurant. I gave them 3 days to respond. Never heard from them. This is how much they care about their customers.",
