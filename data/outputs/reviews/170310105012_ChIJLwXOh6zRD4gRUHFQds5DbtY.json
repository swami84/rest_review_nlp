This morning I was in the store, bought water and Juul pods. When I walked out to my car and opened them up, someone had beat me to it -- they were all opened and EMPTY. When I went back in 30 seconds later to exchange them, I was told it was MY problem and that they only sell unopened merchandise. This is a lie! I literally walked out to my car and right back in -- sorry, we can't take those back or exchange them.  Ended up calling the cops -- they got the managers name and phone number, but of course, no one answers at that number. I will keep trying, but I'm really just writing this review to WARN others. Juul pods are expensive -- I lost $20 by their SCAM, but they will lose my business forever (and everyone I know or anyone I can tell -- we have plenty of gas station options in Rogers Park). So, that's about $200 worth of my business they receive from me each month (snacks and Juul pods -- I need to quit, this may be the reason I do) that they will never see again. My partner and friends also buy from this gas station -- we are all boycotting.  Go out of business already so we can put something HONEST in there, not some scammers. APPAULED!",
