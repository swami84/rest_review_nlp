Apps were delicious, started with the firecracker shrimp, crab cake, these little cheese puffs(forgot what they were called) and the Rockefeller oysters. None of these apps were a disappointment. If I had to choose a favorite it would go to the oysters. The second course we got a cup of lobster bisque. Delicious, when ordering lobster bisque there's always a chance that the soup will be either too fishy or too creamy. They are doing it right at the firehouse. Great balance of lobster and cream. The main course we did a good diversity of things.  Pork chop, skirt steak, surf and turf with the delmonico, and two sirloins. Again, nothing was a disappointment. From all the entrees I enjoyed the pork chop the best. The roasted corn under the pork chop was so flavorful. Light and sweet, went well with the chop but i think what won me over was the cooked peach that was on the side. You get two slices of the peach and it was the perfect amount. Desserts were a bit dangerous, I couldn't stop eating any of the desserts.  Apple pie, key lime pie and the chocolate cake. I couldn't stop eating the key lime pie,  i would recommend it. Service was a amazing, Diana took great care of us and would highly recommend requesting her.",

My bestie and I cannot wait for taco Tuesdays because he makes the best margaritas ever, especially the jalapeno Margarita's. He told us how amazing the burgers were, he was right!  the chop salad and the brussel sprouts were also very tasty, if you're looking for a healthier option.

I even tried to soak it in the butter sauce for the asparagus. Still couldn\u2019t eat it. The soup was good. The asparagus was ok. The fries were good. I feel bad leaving this kind of review. But honestly, this meal cost me just under $100. Barely ate any of it. Wished I saved the money and ate at Taco Bell instead. Disappointed since I thought I\u2019d treat myself and son to a nice Chicago dinner. I could have stayed another night in the hotel for the cost of this dinner.",

Our waiter came to our table asking what we wanted to drink without explaining anything on the menu when I heard him go over the whole thing with the table next to us. He only stopped back two more times to pour wine then take our plates at the end. He brought us dessert menus and put them on the table without saying a word then was shocked when I asked for the check when he returned. He never once asked how our food was or if we needed anything. I said thank you several times and he just would stay silent. We are a younger couple and I hope he wasn\u2019t judging us based on that, but I expect top notch service regardless of how old or young I am.  Let me add to this terrible review. I recently found out the waiter added an additional tip to my check and the only thing the owner of the company did was say I will get a refund. Not even an apology. Nothing. Please be aware of what your check total is because I am sure I\u2019m not the only one they are stealing from.  I will never give this place a dollar again and they are less than a block from my apartment.",

But this was a VERY incorrect assumption on my part. This is a very fancy upscale restaurant...like the kind where the waiters wear white suit coats and we were glared at by other diners who I'm sure were disapproving of our casual attire. The food was great but we felt pretty expensive for what we got...I'm sorry, no french dip sandwich is worth $26! But it was still a  nice once in a lifetime experience.",

I picked Firehouse for the reputation for great food and a local spot in the neighborhood (I live just a block away in the South Loop). I had written in my reservation that it was a dinner to celebrate our engagement. Upon arrival, I sneakily whispered to the hostess to be sure they got the communication of our celebration. She whispered back \u201cwe\u2019re on it\u201d. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a good meal, but no mention of the engagement. I was just hoping for maybe a congratulatory dessert or even a verbal acknowledgment. Just anything special to heighten our dining experience. My fianc\u00e9 and I finished dinner, and I left disappointed. Thankfully, she had no idea that I had tried to plan something special, only to be let down. My fianc\u00e9 went to the restroom and I quietly asked for the manager when we were leaving. I wanted him to be aware of the situation. He was apologetic, but did not offer any way to rectify to situation. Safe to say, I will not be dining at Firehouse again. Good food and atmosphere, but will now just be a bad memory for me. There are many other restaurants in the city that I know can provide a better dining experience.",

Had oysters which were outstanding, fire shrimp which were very yummy. dover sole was excellent. only major disappointment was the burger which was substandard ( burnt taste, dry and comparable to Burger King quality ;-(  even more disappointing because I recently went to Bandera/Michigan Avenue which had THE best steakhouse burger I have had in Chicago- so my expectation was pretty high when ordering the burger at this restaurant . Key lime pie was excellent as well. Wonderful spot to meat up with friends and visitors new to Chicago.",

My dinner was the prime rib and they cooked it exactly right. Too big to eat in one sitting. Great experience and a recommendation for dinner when your in the area.",

I called an hour in advance to make a reservation for two, at 6:15. We arrived at 6:10, went to the hostess and they could not find my reservation. After a 20 minute wait were seated. The waiter was very nonchalant. We both ordered the fillet mignon with scallops. I\u2019ve never been to a swanky steak house that doesn\u2019t warm their plates. The fillet was perfect, but the scallops were cold. The garlic mashed potatoes we ordered for our side, were the consistency of porridge. It was so runny it was difficult to eat with a fork. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience. I really wanted to like this place more.",

He took my husband's back a 2nd time and returned it to the table more charred on the outside, but still undercooked inside.  We gave up sending the meat back and just couldn't eat it because it had no flavor. I have never had this kind of experience at any other steakhouse.  Very disappointing.",

I had to remind him about the drink a couple of times. I was done with the appetizer then I got my drink. I was there with 3 other people, 2 out of town and this place did not leave a good impression. Especially when one of them got the wrong steak. This place is not cheap! HIRE some quality people! I won\u2019t be back, there\u2019s plenty of better places that can provide better service and good food too.",

The tables are too close together so enjoying conversation with those at your table in such a noisy atmosphere is nearly impossible.  The server was very busy with large groups and other tables that it took awkward amounts of times to get anything. He never even introduced himself.  The food was decent.  But way over priced for the quality.  The limited drink selection was horrible and we could hardly choke down our drinks.  We were very disappointed and wouldn't recommend this place for \"date night\" but apparently is great for large parties as that's where the staff's attention was, If you want to pay nearly $50 for a very mediocre stake.",

However the food was another story.  Our waiter was attentive so service was the best part of the night.  I ordered lobster bisque which had very nice presentation but the taste was bland and no sign of lobster pieces which I am used to.   Appetizer crabcakes was one of 2 better dishes we tried.   I specifically asked the waiter about most of the negative reviews I read on the Yelp were all about the steaks they served.   Since I brought a nice bottle of Sea Smoke Ten Pinot Noir with me, I wanted to have a steak so ordered Kansas City cut which is a bone in New York strip.   I mentioned to waiter to make sure it's medium rare which is important for this cut for me.  I can tolerate medium for ribeye or filet mignon which are more tender to start.  unfortunately mine came in totally pink when I sliced the center of the steak.   they took it back and my second worry came true when the replacement showed very light brown on the surface.  I sliced it and it was almost raw.  Since it was getting late I just accepted it and ate the steak around the area which was too rare even for me.   I have to say the meat itself was quality meat and had nice subtle flavor but the kitchen staff was not very good in controlling the cook time for making steaks.  The best side dish was sauteed mushrooms, not overly heavy on butter or oil or salt like many other places I've been to.  Asparagus was ok, a little too charred for my liking.   I also don't recommend Quilt Cabernet my colleague ordered.  They ended up ordering another Robert Mondavi Cabernet. I can't comment on dessert as I left a little earlier.   If the restaurant can have a better system to manage time steaks spent on the grill or monitor the temperature better it would certainly have at least full 4 star reviews instead of 3.5 which is not very good for an establishment like this.  2 stars for food 4 stars for service.",

But the smooth jazz was cool, there was a children's menu. It was a good experience for my 3 and 5 yo. The old fire house feel was nice. The staff brought extra fire station coloring sheets for the kids. The staff was very nice and accomodating. There were other families with kids. The lobster bisque was bisque; I prefer a few chunks of lobster. We order 3, there was no lobster to be found. The vegetables were good, though heavy on the salt. We had a good family experience.",

The service and atmosphere are fantastic and of course the food is some of the best around. Recently they celebrated National Margarita Day by offering some of the best tacos I've ever had. They did a halibut taco and a short rib taco that impressed this transplanted Arizonan. The corn tortilla was warm and slightly crispy and the halibut was lightly breaded and as fresh as can be. The short rib taco was also very tasty. I was also impressed by their salsa which is made in-house and had just the right amount of heat. I am hoping they offer these on their bar menu again soon as I don't want to wait for Margarita Day to roll around again to have a halibut taco that good, (and I don't think I'll find a better one in the meantime).",

Burnt calamari appetizer, first thing we ordered the kitchen \"ran out of\" (mind you, we showed up at 8:00 on a Saturday night) and then our next order took 75 minutes to even arrive at the table (they weren't even very busy).  Steak was 75% gristle and fat, waiter was non existent or just didn't care about anything.  It's sad, not just because a $250 meal was worse than what I could get at Chili's or TGI Fridays (literally), but because this place used to be pretty legit.  They've fallen very far in terms of service, especially food and everything else.  If the restaurant was crowded I could understand some of this, but it was far from being filled.  One mistake here or there?  Fine - but when literally everything is messed up and the wait staff doesn't care, the other tables are saying the same thing...\"this place sucks now\".  Hopefully they'll get some new management in there and start paying attention to the food and service.  But for now?  Don't waste your money.",

Prices are high but fair considering the great quality. Service was phenomenal. Would definitively come back. Here is a dissection of our visit: Reservation at 7 pm: got seated within 2 minutes or less. At the table: water and bread within 2 minutes or less. The menus: there is a kids menu(definitively a plus), the regular menu is very well thought. Appetizers: they had Kumamoto oysters! Grilled octopus.  Among another 6 to 8 choices. Salads: several delightful options. Soups: several delightful options. Main courses: there are options for  fish, chicken, steak, surf and turf, chateaubriand!!!Some plates have option for 2 people. They also have the option for bordelaise sauce on the side. The sides: are awesome and huge portions(the chateaubriand comes with Brussels sprouts or asparagus and potatoes and bordelaise and butter). The wine: good selection and fairly priced. We had the Cava bottle for $32. The scotch: small but very well thought. They have single malts! I ordered a separate glass with ice and a soda water and they didnt charge me separate(I always get irritated when they charge the ice or the soda water at other restaurants). Desserts and coffee: multiple options. The sorbet was very good and a large portion. Our order: 4 people(2 adults, 2 children) Chicken fingers Chicken fingers 6 oysters 1 grilled octopus 1 bottle of cava wine 2 sprites 1 diet coke 1 Chateaubriand 1 Sorbet 1 Higland Park scotch 1 black coffee Total: $250  BONUS: There is point system. Every $300 you get $25 credit.  We will definitively come back!",

The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, the waiter's customer service was good, and it was kind to babies. However, I couldn't find any other children with me, so I wonder if I shouldn't take them with me ... ^^;  I ordered champagne, Argra salad and salmon. In particular, the salmon was a satisfying size and the seasoning was elegant, and the gnocchi-like salmon that was served on the same plate was also very delicious! !! !! The bread was also soft and warm and very delicious! I have replaced it. Lol Of course it's free.  If you come to Chicago, you definitely want to visit this shop again! Thank you very much! !!

My experience here, the staff lacked attention to details which I am accustomed to in a steak house. Below is my experience in detail, one that I have also sent to your e-mail and without surprise, no response. My wife made a reservation for five on June 9th for what supposed to be a great graduation celebration. However, we had to wait a few minutes. Not a big deal by any stretch of the imagination. However, when we were seated we were missing silverware. Afterwards, our orders came out at different times and the waiter did not check on us for a long time. The food was good overall which is why I rated my experience as a three, but it could have been a five with very little effort. It was good, but not a comparable overall experience at the other great steak houses.",

Every room in the firehouse felt like it was themed differently, and didn't fit any mould but unique in its own way.  My only complaint was that the wait was kind of long, we spent around 1.75h but a lot of it was spent waiting for things that I believe could've been faster such as bread, or dessert menu.  Beyond that, still deserving of a 5 star review. My rib roast was incredibly tender, and brick baked chicken was some of the best chicken I've ever had. All paired with the finest vegetable selection of course. The dessert, a gelato selection with fudge and brittle, was absolutely indulgent and definitely not meant for one person.",

Eggs atop my Crab Benedict were overcooked so the texture of the dish was off, but the taste was quite delicious. The Baked Eggs dish looked like soup, it had so much bechamel sauce, served with two very dried out pieces of toast, I'm afraid it was a total miss. But the open faced Croque Madame was beautiful to look at and got raves on its taste. I'd go back, and definitely want to try one of their famous steaks for dinner some time.",
