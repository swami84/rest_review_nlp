Eating out is about more than just the food itself - it's the comprehensive dining experience - and that's where Three Wheels was a big disappointment.  The dining room (if you can call it that) is small, 'industrial chic', and extremely loud.  Very few actual tables; most of the seating is in fact hard metal stools, so there's no real way in which to get comfortable.  Service here was genuinely friendly, but nonetheless slipshod.  We ordered multiple courses, but to our surprise, they brought everything out at once, leaving things to get cold while we were enjoying our soup.  Any restaurant should know better, and have a working ability to pace their service.  Their cooks obviously know how to prepare excellent Thai food.  I wish they were cooking in an establishment that was better set up for actually enjoying it.",

And while they're at it, Three Wheels shows theres hot soupy noodle dishes that are delicious, soulful and heartwarming that's not ramen or pho! The Khao Soi is so perfect for those long cold Chicago nights. It's a light curry ish flavored soup that's sweet, spicy, sour, and slightly creamy. Different textures in soft and hard noodles make the dish more fun to eat Have it with the beef if you can.",

The quality is there. Well worth the \u201cpremium\u201d over your standard take out Thai. Some restaurants open up and go hard, but then slowly lose quality. This is not one of those places. My favorite is the Thai style beef noodle soup, which is similar to my Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but sweeter. Just go! You\u2019ll enjoy it.",

From the delicately devious Noodle Curry with Chicken to their unique spin on a classic Pho that ups the ante creatively to a slightly sweet yet savory concoction of pure delicious joy-- a perfectly balanced contrast of various meats, veggies and rice noodles... you can't go wrong here.  I don't say this lightly, but Furious Spoon, Ramen San, and even some of the best Pho places in uptown such as Tank Noodle will honestly struggle to keep up with the level of culinary depth and creativity that little old three wheels noodles provides. The hybrid fusion of multiple Asian cultures really shines in each dish, the broths hold no bars, taking the best from each tradition while still yielding something new that makes your jaw drop to savor that flavor of creative delight and asking, why didn't someone think of combining this with that before!??  Service is attentive and helpful, pricing is very reasonable, and it's BYOB with a small corkage fee...what else could you want?",

I left the house on a cold day and needed some comfort food, and i don't mean the burger kind. I almost walked past the restaurant (they should really put a sign out or something) but i looked up and there it was. Thai beef noodle soup, salad and chicken wings made for a great dinner. I love the fact that they pack the soup broth separately when you order carryout. Check out the amazing art work on the walls.",
