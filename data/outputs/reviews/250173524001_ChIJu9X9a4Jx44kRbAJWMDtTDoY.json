The flavor is inventive and spot on in everything from their sandwiches to their pies to their bread pudding to their gnocchi (seriously, we've tried almost everything on their menu). Their prices are reasonable, their app is better than other restaurants', and they even have great wine deals. I have avoided raving about them because I don't want more items to go out of stock, but I want them to last forever because they're by far my favorite food establishment in the area, so please eat their delicious food to help keep them alive!",

Top notch cappuccino. I've ordered from there since.",

Also got a double latte that was excellent. One of the items we ordered was not available, so we were refunded, but when we dug into the bag, we saw that we were given some bread pudding to make up for the issue. My husband enjoyed that surprise greatly!  I've been a fan of Gracie's Ice Cream for a while, and happy to see them expand to a bigger menu/new space at Earnest Drinks. I only wish I was still working in Kendall Sq, so I could go for lunch in person. Next time we plan to try takeout so we can partake in some of the adult beverages.  SUPER excited for my ice cream flight, a great way to sample a bunch of flavors without committing to a whole pint.",

And boy were they delicious! I was gonna only drink 2/3 of my whisky pandan frappe (cuz, waistline) but yeah...nope. That disappeared real quick. Perfectly balanced, strong pandan flavor and good smoky whisky flavor, without being cloying or overwhelming. And the mushroom \"cheesesteak\" was LUSCIOUS. Really incredible, umami and earthy and rich but not too heavy, with light and slightly sweet bread.  Sammies and other bites will run you $6-10. Frappes $13. They have other drinks as well, and desserts (Gracies Ice Cream). I can't wait to come back!",
