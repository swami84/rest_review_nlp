I told a friend about them while visiting his apartment and he was bummed they weren't in his delivery radius, so I decided we'd have a pot pie night and he came over. Adja(and the chef) went -above and beyond- to make sure we got our food and it was SO DELICIOUS. All of us were in heaven. Pot pie night is definitely going to be a recurring thing.

It took them 25 minutes to finally take our order even though I told them 3 times that we were ready to order. When they finally took our order, I see that they got my smoothie wrong (I ordered mango and banana, they added a ton of blueberries and then asked me if I was okay with it). How do you screw that up?  Then the French toast that I ordered was burnt on some sides with the strawberries incredibly soggy. I am not sure if it was laziness that made them think it was a good idea to microwave strawberries but I was not feeling it.  Also, it was very cold and every time the door opened and closed, the whole restaurant was blasted with cold air. Please put an enclosure/divider outside of the door.  Overall, I could tell that they were trying their best and the servers were definitely sweet. But combined with the long wait, burnt food and just plain ol\u2019 clumsiness, I will not come here again. Maybe their to-go section of the restaurant is better. I still will not be coming back to find out.",

The decor feels distinctly cross cultural, as a strong West African motif dances with a few \"new Brooklyn\" fixtures, like a changing chalk-marker menu wall, and Edison-bulb hanging lights. With great prices, a great atmosphere, black-ownership, and delicious food, this place is an absolute treat, and quickly becoming one of my neighborhood favorites for a sit-down down meal or a couple hours of laptop work.",
