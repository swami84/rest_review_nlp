Next time you want wings for your next gathering or want to indulge in flavor but not overpay, go to Juicy Chicken on 3rd avenue in Bay Ridge.  The chicken is a marriage of the crispy, flavorful Korean Fried Chicken and savory down home country fried chicken of the American south. The best part: NOT GREASY! EVERY time I have had the wings they were light, have the right balance crumbly covering and meat cooked well with taste that was not too salty or oily like some other chicken places. Try it and tell me I am wrong after you have it. BUT THAT ISN'T ALL! My partner got the Jian Bing with fish and loved it. Had great flavor and was an new fave. We both had their fries and agree it is best shoestring french fries we have had. Have the Jian Bing, wings and fries and enjoy the experience. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.",
