        "caption": "I went there for St. Patricks Day weekend and paid over $400 in total to rent one of their private shacks. It was a complete waste of money. I was greeted by an extensive line out of the door that took over 30 minutes, which left a bad taste in my mouth right away. My friends and I got up to the shack and our server brought us one mimosa pitcher. I told her right away we would need more as there were six of us and she might as well bring a few pitchers so she can attend to other tables. She said okay and then for the next 20 minutes I proceeded to see her and all the other servers attending to the people who didn't pay hundreds of dollars and bringing them pitcher after pitcher. I left my seat to go chase her down and let her know we were waiting for a while, were out of drinks, and she then brought a pitcher of beer mixed with mimosas.  Someone who I suppose was the owner or manager came by our shack and asked if he could take pictures for the website and I said sure and told him I had a question. He ignores me. Takes a picture. Then tries to walk off. I yelled excuse me at him and asked him where to food was that was promised per the $400 package. He says the kitchen is backed up and it should be out in a little. Why is your kitchen backed up when you sold these tickets in advance and knew how many people were attending? We then get our food an hour and a half into the event (that is a two hour max, btw) and they only brought 4 plates for 6 friends. When I asked where the other two were, they said they didn't have them.  We received subpar service the rest of the time. As I stated, the servers had no issues serving the tables that didn't pay hundreds of dollars for the most pathetic \"VIP\" I have ever seen in my entire life. I empathize with servers who are overwhelmed, however, if you want to give good service...try giving your customers solutions rather than excuses. Saying sorry over and over and continuing the poor service made for a terrible experience.  We barely got any drinks. Not enough food for everyone. Bad service. This was my first time going here and I will never be back. I've let others know to avoid this place as well.",

In the 2 hours we were at our table our waitress came around a total of 3 times. We asked our waitress for the bill and waited about 20 minutes before my friend finally went up to the bar to ask the bartender for our check as her card was already at the bar holding the tab. He was very apologetic which we appreciated. We sat around for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our uber and our waitress walked by us several time and never bothered to apologize or even acknowledge us. I've worked as a server and rarely leave a bad tip but was ready to do so this time. But we couldn't because there was an 18 percent service charge. It's clear that the staff didn't care about giving us good service as they'd be compensated regardless. Definitely won't be back. If you want slow service, over priced drinks, all for a good view then go here.",

Having worked in the service industry myself for a few years i know how difficult it can be, but this was truly a bad experience. My friends and I booked the curling package, which is an hour reservation of the curling lane with a table for 6. We arrived at the curling lane, and then our server almost hilariously placed our QR code on our table, which was covered in 6 inches of snow, along with the stack on chairs that were also covered in snow. Eventually we finally persuaded someone to give us a table inside. We then waited about 25 minutes to be served, after getting the finger treatment multiple times. Finally the bartender seemed to feel bad for us and came to take our orders, after which the server (who gave me the finger treatment about 15 minutes previously) came over and was in disbelief that no one had served us yet, and was then upset that the bartender had gone ahead and done so. No apology or anything for having us wait so long, just glared at us as if we'd done something wrong then begrudgingly took our orders. Overall terrible experience here, won't be returning anytime soon.",

I would definitely recommend going for their movie series, it was worth the $10 ticket. The reason for leaving 3 stars is the drinks are really very expensive for what you get. I got a cocktail that was $13 and it was in a plastic cup smaller than a solo cup and my date got an old fashioned which was $15 and was served in an even smaller plastic cup just a little larger than a dixie cup you'd use for mouthwash. They tasted fine, nothing too spectacular, but, even for Chicago, it felt expensive for such small serving sizes. Overall, I would return but wouldn't order a drink which seems odd for a bar so I'm not sure I'll be back unless it's another special event like the movie series!  In terms of Covid precautions, they were taking temps upon entry & the tables had a decent amount of space between them on the rooftop. I felt safe being there.",

Usually reservations are recommended (which come with a min. consumption requirement) but if you're there early or are intending to leave before the reservations start (i.e. 8pm), you should be fine getting a table on the very nice roof top. While you don't have much of a view from that rooftop, the setting actually makes you kinda forget that you're in the city with the beach vibe, fake grass carpet and unobstructed view of the sky. Cocktails come in a plastic cup but were still pretty tasty. Temperatures are taken at the entrance and there's plenty of hand sanitizer on the way to your table.",

The host told me I would be getting this money back once I arrived, but after we finished eating, I was told I have to use the full $50/person amount or else I could only get a gift card to come back and use. No where on the website was this mentioned either!!! The server ended up racking our tab up with drinks we didn't ask for just to reach the full deposit, and we still had to tip on top of the full deposit we gave. It was a frustrating experience and I reached out to talk to someone. Sabah was supposed to call me and I have still not received an answer. Need to fix their customer service.",

        "caption": "On June 24,2020 my cousin and I had reservations to Whiskey Business on 1367 N. Milwaukee Chicago, IL 60622. We had to pay a $100 reservation fee for 2 people. We didn\u2019t mind because it comes off the bill, so we agreed and booked. I booked our reservation through a website called \u201cTock\u201d. When I pulled up my cousin mentioned I wonder if security is going to take our temperature to get in. I told him that\u2019s the guidance, he mentioned \u201cWell those white people didn\u2019t get theirs checked as I waited for you\u201d. I told him maybe they went to their car or was already there... give them the benefit of the doubt. We go upstairs and our server Jessica was really nice.  Here is where the problem came... she brings our tab that states $181 and some change. I almost forgot about the $100 reservation deposit we paid as we were having a blast! I mentioned it and she was like her mistake she will get with her manager to take it off. When she came back our tab was $117. I was kind of confused as 181-100=$81. I noticed a 20% gratuity on our bill for a party of 2 people. I asked her why is that on there, Jessica said her manager did that when she added the $100 on there. I told her go get her manager, who name is Sabah (or Savah) by the way... she comes over and states that she added it on there I asked her why. She said because it\u2019s in the email when you book. I had my email and showed her the website I booked through that doesn\u2019t state that. She showed me a different website that do. Like I told her the two systems isn\u2019t communicating to one another. So when I booked that wasn\u2019t on there. She refused to take it off. Then the manager says \u201cWell if servers feels they are going to get a tip we don\u2019t add gratuity unless it\u2019s a group\u201d.  I asked the white couple (next to us who was leaving) did they have gratuity on their bill and they said \u201cNO\u201d.  That sent me over the edge... you mean to tell me you asking your staff to stereotype or discriminate who they think would tip them? Anybody that knows me know I\u2019m a big tipper but that was by far ignorant. I asked Jessica did you not think we would tip you..she mentioned she never heard of that policy before and she kept apologizing. I paid the 20% because the server was nice but she could\u2019ve had more had the manager not  did that. The manager gave so much attitude because I called her out on discriminating and asking your servers to be ignorant.  The GM Sonia came to talk and offer a VIP section and was nice, however I buy sections all the time! This behavior is disgusting and I will NEVER go there again! I\u2019ve never seen somebody add gratuity for a party of 2, especially based on race!!!!",

Pro tip, if you come when the sun is out, it can get pretty bright and hot in there because of the clear ceiling. Bring sunglasses and lighter clothes!  The food was also really excellent. I got the chicken and waffles during brunch and they were really good. I dock a point because although our server was very good, I didn't get a printed receipt, although I requested one, and I never got a box for my leftovers so I went to the bar to ask for one. Nonetheless, I will definitely be back!!",

They played the worst 80's soundtrack music. I drank faster when Jefferson Starship started. They didn't have the whiskey I hoped for and their list seemed smaller than advertised. This bar personifies the transformation of Wicker Park into West Lincoln Park brotown. I pity the bar staff who have to tolerate so much entitled douchebaggery.",

We arrived here on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm and the place was packed.  The ground floor level was wall-to-wall people and 80% were women. I don't know if there was a bridal party or a special for females at this time, but it was jam packed.  Our private event was held upstairs outside on the rooftop patio. Definitely a day party vibe.  Our group was under the cute covered Cabanas.  They have some cute pillows made to look like stuffed Whiskey Business T-shirts.  It's a really nice patio, but very crowded.  They had great music playing, and the sound level was perfect for conversations.  There were several events going on at the same time. There was a birthday party, a business group, and a large friend's get together, besides our private event.  To drink we had a One Touch Too Much cocktail (elijah craig small batch, orgeat (almond), pineapple juice, lime juice and angostura) and my favorite, an Electric Lemonade (big machine vodka, lemonade and blue curacao).  Especially refreshing on a hot afternoon.  For food we had a plate of delicious shrimp tacos (grilled shrimp with cilantro lime cabbage slaw served on corn tortillas with chipotle crema) and a plate of steak tacos (skirt steak with onions, cilantro and chihuahua cheese on corn tortillas with chipotle crema).  The Steak Tacos were really good, but, I thought the Shrimp Tacos were excellent.  Check out their Brunch Club on Saturdays and Sundays, as well as their weekly specials.  If you want to sit on the patio, I would suggest making a reservation.If you are looking for great drinks and food in a lively atmosphere, head on over to whiskey business!",

Loving fries and whiskey we decided to check it out after our meal.  When we walked in, we were blown away by the hype from the Chicago Bulls party crew!  The Chicago Lovabulls we're there and even Benny the Bull!  They gave each if us some nice hats just for walking in and we entered the raffle just for checking in.  After the welcomed surprise when we walked in, we took a seat and began to look over the menu.  Regret set in after we saw all the delicious Fries and other foods we love because we had just stuffed our faces with tacos.  But we order some whiskey drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The three of us all won prizes from the Bulls crew and another friend joined us later for the fun.  My buddy and I to get there cheese and bacon fries so we did and our other friend ordered the Mac and cheese bites.  We all ordered more drinks as well fell in love with our food.  The crowd cleared out as soon as the game was over and since it was getting late and it was what I call a \"School Night\" since it was a Wednesday and we had work in the morning.  This is a place I hope to frequent more often whenever I come back to visit Chicago.",

A gigantic blow up flamingo (I think) with cold air misting (think hot football games) for you to sit on. Plenty of umbrellas for those not wanting to melt. My Casper the Ghost friend needed that umbrella, and I moved over to grab some rays.  Perfect for us both.  Our server, Scottie, couldn't have been nicer, more professional, and kept a great, upbeat attitude, while he worked in scorching heat. I'd go back just for Scottie and the delicious Mai Tai drinks my friend and I were served.  The first floor, we walked through, to get to the stairs to the roof, is long, wooden floors, and a classic look all around.  Hands down fun!",

They worked hard to keep the area cleared and made sure that everyone had a good time. The food we ordered was good and the drinks were refreshing; the special was a Whiskey Business and it was delicious. Others ordered the frose and had nothing but good things to say. The rooftop is really nice although no views from up there. This was my second time visiting and it was definitely an improvement over the first visit. That time, they had run out of almost all the wine and the food was mediocre so I was pleasantly surprised this time around.",

I had a table on the rooftop; which was nice. Service was awful though. The server looked really sloppy. She wasn't at all attentive and when she did take our order, she never once looked up at us. It took a while to get our $10 Pumpkin Spice Old Fashions. It just tasted like a not so great regular Old Fashioned. The portion was only half a rocks glass and the glass was 90% ice. Then I wanted to switch to beer. They were out of the first two beers that I ordered even though the tappers were still on display. Then I asked the bartender about one I hadn't recognized and he said he didn't even know how to pronounce the name or anything about it. Sooo...that sums up my visit. After that, we left in search of a good old fashioned.",
