I got home from work and was sick with the worst food poisoning I think I've ever had, and the ramen was the only thing I had to eat that day (I skipped breakfast and walked over from work for lunch, hadn't eaten dinner yet), so it's my prime suspect.

Its very simplistic, and it doesnt bombard the eyes with needless information.  The bowls feel cheap. They give you one use only utensils. The trays are made of plastic, and I'm willing to bet the side dish plates are as well.  The soup actually tastes like its made from a powder. Something you would get out of an instant ramen or something. The color (at least for my soup) was a pale khaki. It was cloudy, and it almost looked like you could see the individual particles inside the soup. Not the most appetizing thing.  The noodles were good enough...i guess. Not something special, like a specialized noodle soup place, but not terrible.  I've never eaten chashu before, so I can't really speak about it, but it tasted like real pork, and it had flavor.  Overall, a cozy place good enough for the casual consumer, although if you're looking for authentic ramen, go somewhere else.  As a side note, the bubble tea right next door is pretty good. The value is also quite excellent. Highly recommend.",

Upon entering, the restaurant looks new, simple and clean and you expect it to be a sit down restaurant until you realize it is self service. Nothing wrong with that but it just didn't didn't vibe with the setting in my opinion.  I ordered ramen with tonkatsu broth and tonkatsu meat and my bf ordered the same tonkatsu broth (because they had ran out of chicken broth) with karage chicken. We also had ordered their Rockville roll as well. Food came out pretty fast but not what we were expecting at all. Soup fell flat in the flavor profile my BF's chicken felt like General Tso's chicken without the sauce. The egg was cooked great but had no color or flavor at all - looked like it was just dipped in soysauce. What was infuriating was that we were provided with a small-ass spoon that could barely be reached down to grab any broth.  We weren't that impressed with our sushi roll as well. It was a fried roll with salmon and cream cheese - all components of what I love in a roll - but I didn't even want to finish it after the second piece. There was nothing exciting about it. Also to note, there wasn't even wasabi or ginger in the box with it, just soy sauce.  It is mentioned in some reviews that the price was high for the quality of dishes and I definitely have to agree with that.  Perhaps switching over to resuable bowls and utensils can help cut costs and put it towards the quality of the food.  I hate to be so harsh about a new restaurant opening, but with so many other options to choose from, Yamachan needs to step up their game if they want to vie for more business.",
