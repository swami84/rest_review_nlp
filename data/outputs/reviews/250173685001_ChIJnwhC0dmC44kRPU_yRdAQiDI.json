Sometimes they are friendly but there has been several times where I\u2019ve dealt with rude, unprofessional encounters where they act like they just don\u2019t care. They also  messed up the order twice after I spoke clearly, no offense but they don\u2019t speak the same level of English and blame the customer, giving off such a rude attitude which can really give the customer anxiety and make them not want to come back! The old guy at the front just said \u201cwhatever\u201d after the language barrier. I am a Sicilian / Greek American and speak perfect English.",

Really nice smell to it, baked goods, everything seemed fresh. This is family run and owned, you can tell.  I ordered a half Sicilian with bacon online with an order of fries. They had it ready when I got there in like 25 minutes. Friendly enough staff, speaking Spanish. If you, like many of these other reviewers, can't stand hearing another language in Waltham of all places, maybe don't go to a restaurant that specializes in ethnic food. They clearly speak and understand English, too. Service could not be more professional on that front.  The food is pretty good. The pizza is tasty. The bacon was really nice and genuine. They gave me a whole lot of pizza. Not so much sauce which is how I prefer it, a little more cheese than average, and a pretty thick crust. Not everyone's style but the pizza definitely catered to my tastes. Solid 8/10, would absolutely order again.  Fries were pretty standard pizza joint fries, a little crisper than average of anything. Also tasty.  Whole visit was enjoyable and I'm going to order again for sure. Very affordable pricing.  Definitely continue to support small places like this in Waltham. Moody Street is one of the best places to come to eat because of this.",

I tried to explain that is not their responsibility and I never had issues before, they hung up on my face and I waited another 10 minutes hoping the problem would be resolved with the driver... unfortunately the same rude staff member picked up the phone and when I told him I want to cancel my order he just told me to go through grub hub and again hung up on my face. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re not responsible for the ordering you should never hang up on a customers face. Completely unacceptable. Garbage service, never ordering from them again.  Basura!!!",

My last dealing with them, they cancelled half of my order because they were out of one item, and tried to deliver that half order to us.  Am I supposed to only feed half my family?  I refused the order, and now they are refusing to credit my card one dime.  They've outright stolen money from me, and now I have to deal with it legally.  This is the second time they've done this sort of thing to me.  Be warned, they will steal from you, too.  And just now I find that they're charging us the full amount, the entirety of the order they couldn't fill because they were out of it!  This is straight up theft.",
