Portions are big and price is reasonable for the quality and portion size. I had a chicken biryani entree which was thoughtfully prepared with many spices, and included golden raisins, onions and other nice touches which added to the flavor complexity without overpowering.  My ground lamb kabob appetizer was big enough to be a whole meal in itself, and also perfectly seasoned and grilled just right.  Mango lassi was refreshing and sweet enough without going overboard. Garlic naan was deliciously garlicky.  I'll be back next time I'm in Brooklyn!",

When I ordered it on seamless there was no option to choose with peas or without. I don't know if this is the restaurants's fault, or seamless's but regardless, it was way too salty. Chicken samosas were flavorless and not spiced. At all. Just plain ground chicken and nothing else. No raita included, and the green sauce tasted like straight vinegar, while the tamarind sauce was far too sweet. My naan tasted stale. No utensils or straws included. Lassi, which was definitely not made with fresh mango and came from a pre- made mix... was dark orange and clearly artificially colored, spilled because they placed it in the paper bag sideways!! . I threw my entire order away. Will not be ordering from here again.",

The food tends to err on the spicy side (which is great for those like me who love spice and bad for people like my wife who are sensitive to spicy food).

The staff is always friendly and patient. This is a fantastic addition to the Gowanus area.",

It's really unfortunate that our $30 meal was not worth it.  We ordered daal Turka, naan, rice, tandoori chicken, and 2 drinks. When the meal was delivered the drinks had been forgotten.  The daal was very bland. There was no flavor and it was very watery. There was hardly any lentils in it.  The naan was soggy and the texture was just very off.  The tandoori chicken was decent, but still below the standard of many other indian places I've tried.  My girlfriend and I spent 4 months in India, and while we didn't expect the same quality as we had over there, we expected an indian run restaurant to be able to satisfy our craving. This was unfortunately not the case.  Worst $30 I've spent in a long time.",

Granted that's not saying much but, the few dishes I shared with a friend at this just two week old family operation tonight were really quite good: not too heavy or salty, well spiced.  Sweet and unpretentious service by the kids while the parents handled the back.  Reasonable prices.  Folks should really support this joint so we finally have a decent Indian place in the area!  Four stars might be a more accurate rating, but I'm giving them five to get started.  Might be BYOB for now.",
