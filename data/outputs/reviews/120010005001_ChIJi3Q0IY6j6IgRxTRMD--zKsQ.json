When we walked in it was empty and we saw a sign that said \"please wait to be seated.\" So we waited while we saw a bartender and a server ignore us for about a minute as we stood \"waiting to be seated.\" Finally the server who was sitting told us we could sit wherever we wanted, and then proceeded to make a snarky comment after we chose to sit in a corner booth table. After waiting a while to take our order, the server took our order of the carrot dog and the philly cheese special. We asked if there were any gf bread options and she said there were corn tortillas. We mostly do not eat gluten, but were curious to try this spot out. When we got the food, it was immediate disappointment, in addition to the disappointment on how the server's attitude was. The carrot dog was not flavored and very skimpy for the large bun. There are options to get toppings you have to pay for, but we were curious to taste as is, hoping it would still be good. The side \"salad\" was sad. Dying greens with tomatoes, no dressings and some chips. Very dry. The philly cheese was better, but not good. Also lacked a lot of flavor. The sides were the same. The server did try to fake niceness later on, by telling us that she took longer to fix some hang nail or something? Not sure. When she asked how we liked everything, I said it was just ok. Instead of apologizing, she tried to excuse my bad experience by dismissing me and saying the carrot dog is popular and not for everyone and then walking away. I came to the conclusion that someone could only like this food if they drank alcohol, which makes sense since they are a bar. All white hipster vibe. We were the only Latin Queer people there so maybe that's why we were treated so substandard. Overall would not reccommend and would not go back. Bummed I spent 20 bucks on such a bad experience. Bad food and bad service. The atmosphere feels very cold and unwelcoming. I hope they improve in their menu and service.",

I do wish they had more different vegan/veg options. Like, pulled jackfruit as a meat substitute in the burritos or other plates. Or even some soy crumbles or something. Just something other than tofu/tempeh in which is on the sandwiches. There are so many awesome vegan/veg substitutes and I feel like a veg place should take advantage of the many options. Even some soy chicken wings or something? I didn\u2019t see anything like that but am super hopeful they\u2019ll add it in the future. They know what they\u2019re doing with flavors so I know they could do these things well.  Me and my friend had some cocktails which were INCREDIBLE. Like probably my favorite cocktails in Gainesville. We are so excited about this addition downtown with an amazing bar!",

The menu is simple yet offers a lot for quick bites and a tummy filling brunch. 4 stars for the service. I felt it was a bit too slow given the few number of tables that were occupied. Also, the servers aren't yet aware of all the options on the menu, probably because I went in during the first week of opening. 1 star for the restroom (not a concern if you don't use it). Rest area restrooms in New York look better in front of this one. Overall, I would be back here every weekend from now on, just for the food ;)",
