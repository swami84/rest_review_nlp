One of the things I used to do on Friday evenings was get a takeout order.  My favorites were the fall-off-the-bone lamb shanks stew; or the grilled chicken; or chicken kabobs - which all came with 2 sides and pita bread. They serve grilled salmon as well. They made, what I call rice-a-roni - better than that commercial brand - laced with subtle spices. Those family-sized\u200b portions always lasted me through the weekend.  I also remember every time I stopped by, I\u2019d see folks ordering this stuff that looked like green and red peppers in olive oil \ud83e\udd14. Finally, I tried it and it was soooo much better than I expected. It was actually eggplant in this luscious, mild tomato sauce with subtle seasonings that made it simply delectable! From that point on I always included this \u2018stuff\u2019 in my order by pointing to the \u2018stuff\u2019 through the glass display at the counter.  So, fast forward: I\u2019m visiting my hometown and wondering if my neighborhood joint is still open\u2026Hurray! I\u2019m very happy to be in a familiar place seeing that not everything in DC has changed.  Guess what? I now know what that \u2018stuff\u2019 is - \ud83d\ude06! I ordered 4 along with lamb shank stew and the \u2018rice-a-roni\u2019 to take back to my home in NYC!  Homestyle, family-sized portions and a relaxed, no-nonsense\u200b atmosphere.  A family-run\u200b business. They must be doing something right.",

It's not really a place that you go for the service because it is mostly self serve, after you have received your food. It's all about the food here. The lamb pita and the hummus were still stellar and just how I remembered everything. I pretty much had the whole place to myself. I'm glad that this place survived the massive closing down of businesses in Adams Morgan. It is nice to see a business survive, but that is because of the quality food and generous portions. It is located between Bank of America and a Health Food Store. The closest subway station is the Columbia Heights Station (Green Line). If you find yourself in the area, then stop by. You won't be disappointed.",

When I got the food, it was wrapped up well in foil and a second interior layer, and they gave it to me in a little paper to go bag. Tasty! Would go back! Wish I'd discovered it sooner!

If you call ahead it will probably take around 15 minutes or so to get your meal so I would definitely not consider this place fast food.

I have tried the chicken kabobs, kufta kabobs, and beef and lamb combo meals and enjoyed them all. If you want something cheap and tasty I totally recommend the Astor burger (basic beef burger patty seasoned with Mediterranean spices and feta cheese). It\u2019s just under $5 out the door!",

While it offers some very delicious items there are a few things to note:  - some of their food is pretty pricey for carryout - the wait is FOREVER, even if you call ahead - the food is inconsistent - when it's great it's great, but when it's bad it's terrible (i.e. hamburger meat, chicken brined too long sometimes, dry meat)  That being said I do continue to visit Astor, but only order certain items when I know that I will have 20+ minutes to wait for my order.",

        "caption": "Great place, good service, great food!  This place has a wide variety of food, from mediterranean to sandwiches and pizza.  I love their half chickens and legs of lamb, and their side dishes are great; the \"astor vegetarian\" plate is like a sampler of the cold side dishes, and sometimes I get then even though I'm not vegetarian.  They also have great pitas.  I can't really vouch for their sandwiches and pizzas, though, because I usually stick with ethnic foods when I'm at an ethnic restaurant.  They don't do table service, generally.  You order at the counter and then they call your number when it's done.  You are supposed to bus your own table.  However, they are very friendly to us, and sometimes will bring it out.  Plus, this setup keeps the cost down (the place is pretty inexpensive) and you don't have to do a 15-20% tip, so I'm all for it.",
