During the pandemic, menus from The Game Sports Pub and Tiki on 18th were available to order from, indoor seating was prohibited, and masks were required if you weren't eating or drinking. Heat lamps were a great addition to their outdoor patio.  I'm glad I had made a reservation because it was pretty busy here. The staff (including Jo Jo and Orlean) were friendly and hospitable.  For drinks, my friends enjoyed Blue Hawaii, Painkiller, and Jet Pilot cocktails. I enjoyed the Ole' Christmas 'G' and the Hot Dad Tod. The Ole' Christmas 'G' consisted of rum, bourbon, and clarified gingerbread milk punch shaken and served over the rocks in a shiny red disco ball drink tumbler with a Christmas paper straw and served with an iced gingerbread man. It was delicious! The Hot Dad Tod consisted of rum, darjeeling tea, and falernum, heated, garnished with a lemon wedge and served in a gnome shaped ceramic mug. It was light and kept me warm.  While we were waiting for our food, we snacked on Kropek and Spicy Popcorn. The Kropek consisted of crispy and flavorful prawn puffs. The Spicy Popcorn consisted of popcorn seasoned with cayenne, garlic, butter, salt, and pepper.  For appetizers, I enjoyed Lumpiang Shanghai and Chicken Inasal Skewers. The Lumpiang Shanghai consisted of four thin spring rolls filled with pork and mushroom, cut in half and served with sweet mango chili vinegar dipping sauce. The Chicken Inasal Skewers consisted of three skewers with grilled chicken thigh marinated in soy and vinegar, served over a banana leaves and with fish sauce, spices, and annatto oil dipping sauce. I loved how tender and flavor the chicken skewers was.  For dinner, my friends enjoyed the Crispy Dinuguan, Chicken Adobo, and Java Bowl. I ordered the Vegan Pansit, which consisted of cornstarch noodles stir fried with garlic, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, purple cabbage, carrots, and baby corn with soy sauce and garnished with crispy tofu. I felt that the dish was a bit saltier than I like but I'd eat it again. My friends ordered sides of hand-cut fries served with ketchup. I loved how crispy the fries were.  For dessert, my friends enjoyed the Fried Oreos and Coco Funnel Cake. The Fried Oreos came fresh from the fryer. The Coco Funnel Cake consisted of funnel cake fries, topped Tiki coco-loco sauce, and dusted with powdered sugar. The coco-loco sauce made the funnel cake more interesting (in a good way). Despite the cold weather, I ordered the Classic Halo Halo, which consisted of macapuno, nata de coco, leche flan, sweet jackfruit, shaved ice, milk, ube ice cream, and pinipig. I'll admit it was a bit difficult to enjoy from a to-go cup but it satisfied my sweet tooth cravings.",

I have been trying to take stock of my favorite places that really covid considerate, have good cocktails and are warm and inviting and Tiki on 18th hits all the marks. They prefer to seat folks in the parklet out front of the bar, which they've put a lot of effort into creating a cute little space with real palms and high top seating. I recommend getting a reservation on the weekend. The food is a mix of bar food and Filipino food.  Jojo is awesome, he's taken care of us a couple of times now, and he's always thought of everything we might need. They don't have sanitizer on the tables but come around and squirt it into your palms.  The cocktails are just lovely, I highly recommend the saturn, and the frozen pi\u00f1a colada!",

For drinks we  had Jungle Bird, Port Light, Saturn, and Rye-Tai.  Not a bad drink in the bunch but our fav was the Saturn (and we aren't typically gin drinkers).  Besides the food and drink being amazing, I have to give them credit for taking their covid precautions seriously!  Hand sanitizing, distancing, mask wearing, and taking contact information in case they have to contact trace.  A++",

The food portions were small and expensive but were flavorful. I will definitely be back.",

Or better yet, go to Archipelago.",
