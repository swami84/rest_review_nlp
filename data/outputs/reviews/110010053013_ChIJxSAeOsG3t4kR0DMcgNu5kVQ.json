I'm glad I did, because we were blown away by the experience! The ordering process was smooth and straightforward - I was helped by Kiyomi, who was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly, and helped me pick out a sake pairing. The Kaiseki was delivered right on time, with a smile, and without any issues. The food itself was delicious and meticulously assembled, with a balanced combination of sushi and non-sushi items. The flavor profile was right on point - very authentic Japanese (which can be somewhat hard to find in DC), with a hint of an American flair. Bonus points for seasonal (i.e. winter) Japanese ingredients. On top of everything, the value was great - very decent quantity of food for the price. 100% recommend the Kaiseki box set!",

The maki roll had a good amount of salmon with more fish in each piece than you'd normally get at a sushi place or grocery store. The nigiri also had fat slabs of fish too. Quite generous, I'd say! Though the price is up there, it's totally worth the cost. The quality is top notch.  A mild observation is that they put only small dabs of spicy mayo on top of the roll, which I suspect they did to avoid overpowering the flavors of the other ingredients.  Overall, great sushi! Thanks for providing me with a great meal for my bday :)",

They are always busy and the servers are efficient. However the hostess has not always been friendly. This has not been an issue until my last experience. I had placed to-go order in the past and was able to pick up the order by giving my name. My last pick up for an online order was a different story. The hostess asked for the order number and I told her I don\u2019t have it. She told me again to get my number and wouldn\u2019t look up my order. I didn\u2019t have my phone with me and thought I should be a simple order pickup. I ended up walking back to my place to get the order number. The service definitely could have been better with the Michelin rating. Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be going back.",

No melting in your mouth, so chewy that I had to eventually give up and spit out. In terms of vibe, their ambience and bgm makes it feels like a spa, but not quite in terms of how much dust there is. I\u2019m not a person who dusts their home everyday (maybe once a month), but their place was horrendously dusty that i find them everywhere. Staff was nice though.

Never experienced the \u201camazing\u201d sushi that was recommended to us by the concierge at our high class hotel nearby because the ma\u00eetre d' could not have been ruder. He told us very roughly and loud that no tables were available nor would be available even if we waited!  We got there at 7:45pm on a Wednesday night... for such a highly rated restaurant, the rudeness is surprising. So much for showing my colleagues a good sushi restaurant in DC. Our low review was voiced to the hotel concierge as well. Ended up having a great meal nearby at Hanks Oyster Bar where the staff, food and atmosphere couldn\u2019t have been better!  This incidence makes me not want to come to Sushi Taro again.",

        "caption": "Sushi Taro focuses on Kaiseki meals that combine hot appetizers, sashimi & sushi appetizers and main sushi and cooked dishes. I was really looking forward to this dinner because of the Michelin star rating the restaurant received.  The price of regular Kaiseki dinner is reasonable, especially compared to Manhattan Kaiseki places. The men\u2019s restroom was also clean.  Unfortunately, these are the only two favorable comments I can make about this restaurant.  I am not sure  if this was the worst dinner I have ever had because I have had my share of bad dining experiences in my life.  But I am certain that this was the most disappointing dining experience of my life because of the high hopes I had based on the Michelin star rating.  To start, many of the dishes, especially the first few appetizers, did not taste freshly prepared.  They tasted like they were made in the morning and served for dinner after sitting on a lonely counter for hours.  The tamago, for instance, tasted like egg-flavored styrofoam.  Although the sushi and sashimi offerings included some unique and adventurous pieces (like baby eels), unfortunately, they all smelled terrible (think of seafood purchased weeks in advance and served just before the expiration date and you will get the picture) and tasted even worse (whoever was the cook, he or she couldn\u2019t have been proud of these dishes).  The most unforgivable part of the sushi experience was the rice. As many sushi chefs will tell you, rice is even more important to good sushi than the fish.  Not only was the texture of the rice bad (too wet and too many broken grains) but the rice smelled fishy. At first, I thought that the chef had prepared one of the sushi dishes that way on purpose but it quickly became obvious that all sushi rice smelled fishy.  This tells me that the chef does not seem to clean his or her hands sufficiently between cleaning, preparation and handling of the fish and the preparation of the sushi.  This also makes me suspect that knives and cutting boards used to clean and prepare seafood are also used to make sushi without adequate cleaning.  Whatever the culprit, the result is disastrous. The rice, which should be clean tasting, taste like it has been contaminated by day old fish.  Even the cooked dishes (other than the lobster spring roll, which was ok even though it smelled greasy) were mostly terrible.  \u201cWagyu\u201d sukiyaki, for example, was the equivalent of a frozen teriyaki dinner sauce boiling sad looking pieces of defrosted-by-microwave low quality smelly old beef purchased at a Costco sale.  The only good thing about the dish was the soft cooked egg accompanying the sukiyaki.  I left most of my dishes half finished.  Unlike servers at good Japanese restaurants, our server didn\u2019t care enough to report this to the manager and offer ways to remedy the terrible experience.  She was friendly enough but didn\u2019t seem to care about the fact that I left more than half of my food uneaten.  After the first 30 minutes, I couldn\u2019t wait for the meal to end.  I ended up getting a grilled cheese sandwich to top off a sad culinary experience.  I am not a Washington DC resident but I recommend that the fine residents of our nation\u2019s capitol go elsewhere for their Japanese meals.",

Strangely, there are people waiting in front of us. I think it's weird sitting at a table. I asked the person who was taking the order if it was available as a happy hour.

I had made reservations 2 weeks prior for Friday, Lunch at 1:30pm. Reservations were completely booked. I had to change the reservation from 3 people to 2 people due to a change in plans and I could not get in touch with them (they never answer the phone, I've tried various times on different days). **this is because they charge a fee if the # of people you reserved for don't show up. You have to input a credit card # when reserving. -- after contacting their reservation manager \"Resy\", they were able to change it for me.  Pros: -We were seated promptly -Food came out more or less promptly -The food was good. For a Michelin star, I can taste that the quality of the sushi is fresh and good.  Cons: -Our waitress was kind but kept forgetting things (like basic utensils for the miso soup and the mochi at the end). She barely checked up on us (but the place was busy). -Miso soup was not hot.  I think my experience was really shaded by my expectations and the service we received as well as my stress over the reservations and not being able to contact the restaurant.",

However, the host and waiter were extremely transparent and forthcoming that regardless if two seats opened at 6:55pm or 7:15pm, they would seat and serve us at happy hour prices. We ended up sitting at 7:00pm and the food did not disappoint. Highly recommend for locals in DC as well as those traveling to DC who are craving fresh sushi.",

(Our fault)  The first time, informing us there are no more bar seats, and then seating the next people at the bar.  We politely asked what it was about and received a very snarky response of the people paid $200 for the seats, and asked if we wanted to pay.  A simple answer would have sufficed.  The next time we were a person too slow again.  She asked us if we want to wait an hour which is understandable.  When we looked at each other and started to say no she rudely brushed us off and asked the next guest before we could even take a step out of the way.  Overall not the hospitality I would expect from a Michelin star that prides itself on service...",

In New York at the same price point it would be closer to middle-of-the-pack, but still very fresh and well prepared pieces. Nice pace to the meal as well, and excellent service the whole time.  Five glasses of sake came as the pairing, one being plum-infused for dessert, which I\u2019d say was worth it as you get a nice variety but not entirely necessary for the experience.",

Even though when making our resos with resy the description for the menu indicated a traditional kaiseki AND a sushi kaiseki, when we arrived we found that they only have a combined version of the two. We thought that was even better! The food presentation was lovely, the flavors had incredible depth and our server patiently explained to us every dish that she was presenting to us. The traditional kaiseki included 12 pieces of nigiri, three of which we could choose, a few appetizer and soup courses, a main and dessert, and cost 100 USD. My favorite was the citrus mushroom soup that came in a little teapot. Having grown up on some of the world's best Japanese food outside of Japan, we considered the sushi here to be very good. There was plenty of food in this kaiseki course and we were stuffed! We'll try coming back next time for the omakase.",

As depicted in the pics, the sashimi for 3 was truly amazing (good for photos too). You'll be attracting eyeballs when this one comes along. For a sashimi lover, I truly enjoyed the sashimi platter, no fishy smell in any of the pieces, including the oysters. I love how different varieties of seaweed was mixed within the plate, simply a beautiful scene.  Japanese fried chicken almost never let me down. The karaage was extremely tender, and of course boneless. People who read my reviews know I never order any chicken dish, but karaage is always the exception, this one didn't let me down. However, there were only three pieces, so the portion was on the lighter end.  And here comes the very mediocre 10+1 piece sushi. Yea, with the sashimi platter on the side, this one was not that interesting. The fish was fresh and the uni/roe were all very good, but this is really the one that fills you up with rice (just in case the sashimi platter is 'too much fish').  The only disappointing factor is the decor, consider it very boring in this price range. The fact that I didn't even place an image proves the point, but I guess the food is our focus here.  Be sure you make a reservation. Not sure if parking if easy. Service is on par with restaurants in this range.  food 4/5 ambiance 3/5 service 4/5 value 4/5",

If you haven't done so already, I would highly recommend it, and you are required to make an online reservation 30 days in advance. Also, it costs around $200, but totally worth it!  Regardless, this time I came here for lunch, which you should make reservations since it was packed even though I came as it opened. The entrance to the restaurant is pretty small that leads upstairs to the dining area where the host will take you to your seats. The staff is welcoming. I ordered the Premium Chirashi Set, Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Shrimp Tempura Roll, and 3 different desserts.  The good: The Premium Chirashi Set is delicious! If you love fresh raw fish, and don't care what type of seafood you're given, then this is the dish to order to have a variety of different sashimi. It comes in a bowl of sushi rice with the sashimi layered on top of it.  The Santa Barbara Sea Urchin (Uni) is creamy and delicious! I could consistently order this and eat more of this if money wasn't an issue! I would definitely order a large bowl of Uni on top of Sushi Rice if possible. The Shrimp Tempura Roll is very crunchy and delicious! The tempura flour on the shrimp was light and tasty, and it's probably my favorite shrimp tempura I've ever had thus far.  Desserts: Can't remember the names of the other 2, but the one you want to order is the Taro Banana Chocolate Crepe! The dessert is absolutely delicious with the banana wrapped with chocolate, and then you have a dipping sauce of chocolate to make it burst with sweet delicious flavors.  Overall, this is definitely the best sushi spot in the DC Metropolitan area that I've visited. They definitely deserve the Michelin Star, and I plan to return to have their Omakase Counter again.",

You are expected to know that there isn\u2019t a happy hour menu, basically their sushi menu is half off. If you want a guaranteed seat, come at 4pm to line up, make sure you\u2019re the first 3 in line. Some people line up early, but have larger parties joining them, so the first three people might total 9 people by the time the door opens at 5:30pm. As for the food, the sushi is bland, has no taste, no flavor, no texture. Trust me, when done right, sushi is a burst of complex, understated, nuanced flavors. This was not the case for the sushi offered during HH. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this place is decent to eat at, just not sure what all the hype is about. Ordered the following: fatty tuna, yellowtail, amberjack, mackerel, md shore roll. Good luck with your search for good sushi in the city.",

If there are five or more people, a large table at the back. However, note that there are only two. The ingredients are Japanese things and authentic. Both items are delicious, but they are slightly darker. Sake is abundant but there are few Japanese beers. Since the clerk is not Japanese, it is impossible to answer detailed dishes in Japanese. However, it is classified as Washington DC in the United States because it is well educated. There is no parking lot in the store and there is a private parking lot in the basement near the back, but it is $ 15 but it is difficult to understand the entrance. As DC is hard to find a parking lot, it is necessary to conduct a preliminary survey. The nearest metro station is Dupont Circle. Reasonable price. It is not a family restaurant.

I have been to their happy hour, unashamedly, over 6 times and I have left extremely happy and satisfied every time. Their happy hour runs from 5:30PM-7PM but you have to start lining up around 4:30PM, closer to 4:00PM if on a Friday. They only take the first 10 for bar seating and after that it's really up to how quickly the first 10 people leave. Their seafood is amazingly fresh and consistently top quality. I will always make time to come back to their happy hour.",

Here are couple of things I love: 1. The big sashimi boat: the chef makes wonderful and exciting choices and it\u2019s gonna be different every time, it includes lobster sashimi that is rare to find; 2. Special small dishes: always exciting surprises awaits, last time we were there we had the soft shell turtle sashimi which is unheard of and taste amazing 3. The house-made tofu: I could just go back there and order two tofu and eat only that - it\u2019s nothing like the tofu you buy, you can detect the sweetness and aroma of bean from it 4. The REAL wasabi: grind from wasabi plant with shark skin - the way it used to be in Japan and the way it should be. It just works so well with the sashimi. It\u2019s bit pricy but it worth every dime",

My guest loved her meal and I can agree hers was delicious, but unfortunately my meal was a bit of a disappointment.

The tuna inside has body and clear fatty taste, and the strong flavor of scallions made the fish taste even better. I love it so much i had to order another portion, even though it passed Happy Hour and I had to pay full price ($12). I will come back for the negitoro, but will try different types of nigiri next time. I also tried the lunch set, with tempura shrimp and veggies, grilled mackerel and some sashimi. Sashimi was great, fresh and melted in the mouth. The rest was ok, i wasn't specially impressed by anything but overall the food was cooked beautifully with good quality ingredients.",

Yes, the fish tasted fresh but my waitress never even explained what the types of fish were served to us when she brought the plates over. I found it odd but my boyfriend didn't care so I didn't bring it up to the waitress. She also never offered us more tea and only checked up on us once. The issues with the sushi are the rice itself and the wasabi. The rice was lacking the proper taste, I could not taste the hint of rice vinegar, it was dry and not as sticky as it should be. We had to be extra careful so that the sushi wouldn't fall apart. At one point my salmon sushi completely fell apart in my soy sauce. The most annoying issue is the inconsistency of the amount of wasabi they put into the sushi. Out of the 10 pieces of sushi and 6 piece maki, 4 pieces had so much wasabi my nose was burning.",

The unenthusiastic waiter could not be bothered to explain the menu or give any recommendations let alone answer any questions.  He seemed irritated that we did not place our order immediately.  This was only confirmed when he let us know the kitchen would be closing should we want to place a final order and the house was nearly full at this point.  Hardly the level of service one would expect from a Michelin Star establishment!  One can make affordances for this experience should the food be spectacular but this was not the case.  The small plates from the hot kitchen were bland with the exception of the shrimp croquette.  The sushi was fresh and tender as one would expect given the price.  The wasabi sometimes overwhelmed the flavor of the fish.  Certainly not the memorable meal we anticipated!",

They have a rather wide selection of saki for various tastes. The sushi is fresh, fairly imaginative and very well presented.  If you happen to get a seat for the small section at the bar you can sample a decent portion of the menu at half price - seating is very limited for this deal.  This is a go to place for Sushi in DC.  Always feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @joerazz",

We placed a reservation ahead of time for 8:30pm on a Saturday and luckily upon arrival managed to find free street parking.  Most of the items we ordered were good, although not exceptional. Our favorites were the desserts:  - $6  Hojicha Pudding: 4.5 / 5 -- really good but really small portion size for a single person - $8 anmitsu with green tea ice cream: 4/5 -- good sized dessert with variety - Free seasonal Cherry Blossom Ice Cream -- got this for free because we were celebrating a birthday - $15.95 shrimp tempura soba: 4/5 -- we liked the soba but we had better tempura at Sushi Damo in rockville - $12 fatty tuna with scallion: 4/5 - $17 sukiyaki artisan roll: \"beef, poached egg, scallion, onion chips on hot plate.\" This was our least favorite at a 2.5/5 and something we'll skip next time because a bit too greasy for us  Overall, service, location, and atmosphere were great, so we'll come back to try other dishes in the future",

Miso soup isn't prominently listed on the menu, but they have it, and it's particularly nice and worth adding. The drink selection is good too -- interesting beers and wines in addition to an encyclopedic sake list. Plus, the wait staff was friendly and patient as my disorganized group of five muddled through our orders. Both times I've gone I've ordered a la carte rather than getting the tasting menu. It's significantly cheaper a la carte (even for hungry sushi fans), but the tasting menu looks worth trying for a special occasion.",

I have been to many restaurants in numerous cities and all have been equal or better at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price $135 for 25 pieces and a small can of beer. Additionally, the forcus was overwhelming based on fresh and quality (while extremely important, it is expected too), there was nothing special about the food or prep. The service was competent and attentive, but dispassionate and indifferent.  All said, it was nothing unique or special, felt I paid a very high surcharge to have extremely  fresh high-quality sushi from a grocery store, meaning 8 choices prepared and presented.",

Even then, you would expect a tasting menu to be of high quality and high value.  For what I paid for the tasting menu ($90 without pairing), I would be better off selecting from the menu the dish that I like to eat.  For the evening, I selected the Sushi Kaiseki option.  Kaiseki is a Japanese multi-course dinner, typically serve with 8 to 14 dishes or more at Chef's discretion.  Having stationed in Japan, I always love these dinner since they are all prepared with fresh and seasonal ingredients.  Sushi Taro's menu started with a deep fried whiting dipped in sweet vinegar sauce.  This first course, known as sakizuke, intent to whet your appetite and prepare you for what to come.  Instead, this course from Sushi Taro was bland and taste like leftover from yesterday's meal.  It set the tone for the rest of the evening with many courses that at best could be described as mall's sushi.  The best course of the evening came in the third course with fresh sashimi.  There is nothing that I would describe as above average.   The 7th course is sukiyaki with \"kobe\" beef.  Nothing to write home either.  Overall, it could be described as below average and with the price, it is really overvalue with this nine course dinner.  I have heard amazing things about Chef Yamazaki and I am really looking forward to next time at Omakase Counter.  Otherwise, I would skip the tasting menu and go straight to the mall for sushi.",

Their selection is great, and the chef is nice.  That being said, here is why I took away two stars. Number 1 is the staff. Extremely unpleasant. Every now and then, I get a good waiter and my experience is 5 stars. But most of the time, the waiters seem to be angry of my existence and me being in the place. For that reason, I took away one star.  The second star, I took away is due to their attitude during happy hour. If you come in for happy hour, the staff looks at you like you are out of your mind. There might be a table that will be empty in 5 minutes --that's literally what happened before,-- but they will tell you there is still 45 minutes to free a table to deter you from sitting in the happy hour section. Not only that, I have been here once for happy hour, and there were two empty seats and they told me there was none. I showed them that there were some and the waiter kept stalling to try and run the clock down for happy hour time. I had to talk with the waiter and tell him to NOT be so unprofessional.  Otherwise, the food is almost on par with sushi capitol and when I come outside of happy hour times, the food is always great. The service not always so much, but food is always great. If you can get over that, you should have a pleasant experience.  UPDATE: Above was my review almost 8 months ago. Bi-monthly visits later, I have to say that this is one of the best upscale sushi restaurants in the US. Great customer service outside of happy hour. They seem a bit standoffish for happy hour, but that's understandable considering you are getting everything half off.  But past the happy hour entry part, the actual person responsible for the happy hour is extremely helpful and great. 10/10 overall. Great fish quality. Awesome crew.  Note: Do not forget to get a pack of beer to the kitchen before ordering. It will go a long way in them remembering you and will improve your experience dramatically.",

She did not explain dishes well and her English was not adequate for the job. We would not have ordered the creme brulee if we knew there were beans on the bottom. The waitress was difficult to understand at times and she did not understand us well. We also found it very strange that we were given two folded up pieces of paper with pensil marks all over it, to select our sushi course. Moreover, the whole party had to share these 2 pieces of crumbled paper. The food was great, but I think that the strong mackerel sushi should not really be on a tasting menu. That level of fishiness is an acquired taste. The sake discriptions were odd... they were kind of backhanded compliments for the lower prices sakes. Ambiance of the venue was lacking for what one would expect from the price point. Overall our guest left unimpressed, which is a real shame.",
