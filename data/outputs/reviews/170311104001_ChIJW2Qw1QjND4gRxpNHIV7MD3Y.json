        "caption": "I went here for dinner. I had the Italian Sausage sandwich and it was very good. The fries were good also. The sausage was it high quality and the red sauce was excellent.  It also came with coleslaw, which was great. I'm picky about my coleslaw and I really liked this one.  The people are friendly. The place is clean and looks well kept.  I will continue to go here.  Bicycling: Higgins would be just an okay road to ride on. You would be better off on the local side streets. I didn't see any outdoor seating or notice a bicycle rack.",
