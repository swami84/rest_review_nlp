It\u2019s a small spot and they were attempting to make the bowl when the driver arrived. I lost my $30 promotional credit because of this.

I'm a total jus-head and have tried all the major jus shoppes in NYC. I've always longed for a spot that makes mylks and juices identified by color (ex: blue mylk, pink mylk. Etc.). Lively also does what most others don't, they add synergistic adaptogens and other spices and herbs like tocos and maca to their signature drinks.  Unfortunately, although I REALLY wanted to be a fan, their products are pretty gnarly and rancid. They simply don't taste fresh. I'm so disappointed. It's one of those experiences where you keep drinking hoping you'll get used to it and develop a taste for it... Nope. Godawful. Serious props to the design and the unique menu. It's a shame, don't waste your money.",

We had the perfect Instagram worthy seating lol and food looked as pretty as it tasted. I love how they have really good magazines/ books to read. I will say the employee was really sweet and friendly. Me and my boyfriend had an amazing breakfast date here! I really recommend you all this cute cafe if you're looking for a great food and an aesthetic vibe!",

I have been coming here for coffee and occasional snack for over 4 months on almost daily basis , I suppose that qualifies me as a regular customer . It was pleasant at first , and one of their barista is actually a very polite and sweet guy . The issue was with someone else , as she yelled and slammed coffee at me one morning, Oh and threatened to call police!! I was more than outraged at what happened but particularly how the sitauation was handled. The manager never addressed this incident , the barista still works there. So I suppose by their standards this is an acceptable behavior by their staff. Major disappointment ,  with abundance of places in the area I will be taking my business elsewhere. Good luck to you , with service like that , I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll survive much longer.",

The aesthetic is beautiful and the young lady at the counter was phenomenal but that is where it ends . My smoothie was obviously made incorrectly. I told the cashier whose demeanor seemed to change instantly . She said the smoothie would have to be made over . Which I was fine with . I told her I would definitely wait and took a seat. After that she returned to tell me that the chef refused to make the smoothie for me. I was actually blown away. I had to laugh. I explained that I know spirulina and matcha can often overcome other flavors but that I am 100 percent certain there was no banana in my smoothie ., which it was supposed to have . Apparently they use frozen bananas and that\u2019s why my smoothie tasted like frozen water and nothing else :/ I left with some sugar in a cup which I was told to add to the smoothie mysel and $9.50 later , quite disappointed I left the store . I say all of this to say. I work in a service industry and I know what negative reviews can do to a small business so I never post them but I was incredibly disappointed by the service I received today . I was kind , super understanding and I think it would have behooved the staff to make a better effort. It\u2019s really not that hard to treat every customer the way you would want to be treated .",
