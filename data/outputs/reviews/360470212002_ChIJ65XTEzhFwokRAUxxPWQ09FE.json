The food was mediocre. There was nothing special or good about the food that would warrant me to order again. The chicken had a lot of small shattered bones in between bites; about the size of half a grain of rice. Drinks were overpriced so it was not ordered. Although the establishment has the look and feel of a service restaurant, it's actually semi cafeteria style. Menu items are ordered and paid for first at the counter. You seat yourself and food is then brought to you when ready. Doggy bag available, containers are next to register counter. Help yourself.",
