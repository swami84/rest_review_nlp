When I got home, all of the tacos were dumped with a lot of shredded lettuce and a little bit of meat. None of the meat was seasoned and my hard tacos were soggy af! The margaritas were watered down (I\u2019ve had the margaritas before and it was nothing like this). The only good thing was the salsa, chips and guacamole.

Since we are at-risk, we can no longer Dine-in to Lime and are forced to resort to take-out. The order we made today will unfortunately be our last. For the last 3 times we've ordered from here, they simply refuse to give us ANY salsa... every dish served here comes with tortilla chips which requires said salsa, unless a bland chip is something you'd like to eat a lot of. It's frustrating that the plethora of FREE salsas offered at this place, a staple of the joint, never makes it to our home. Adding to insult, the steak in the quesadillas were chewy and disgusting. No more Lime for us unfortunately, the quality and customer care has gone to the gutter.",
