Beers were just Ok (I had their \"hoppiest\" selection of 4 beers, the 808, Eee, rye and skinny jeans. They were lacking a depth. The hop ending was there, but no nose nor richness. We had the pizza, burger and hummus plate. The hummus had 0 flavor and was very gritty. The pizza sauce also lacked flavor, but the cauli crust did have a good taste and fantastic texture. The burger was the bright spot to the meal. The cook was spot on and the meat was delicious.",

Being situated on a corner lot, there is lots of seating to allow you to enjoy the semi outdoor dinning and people watch on the side walks as the hustle and bustle goes buy and your enjoying your beer or what ever drink seems best to wet your whistle.  As most breweries do, they offer tasting flights and they do have a pretty big selection to chose from. I normally like what I like, but when in such a place, enjoy taking part of sampling the house brew offerings.  So as far as the food, yes it is bar food and the usual suspects are on the menu, but I tried the Gyoza Sausage Sandwich and was very impressed. It was packed and yummy with an assortment of toppings that added taste contrasts. Got it with the onion rings and they were pretty impressive as well, but if you need something on the lighter side, you can get a healthy side salad option that is actually a healthy salad.  Staff were your typical for this type of joint. Friendly and attentive, but probably short lived in this type of industry.  Our overall experience was good and will probably be back next time in the mood for this type of beer and food experience.  Whether you are a local or tourist, if you just want to be in a place to drink good beer and have good bar food, this is the place. Nothing more and nothing less.",

I thought about being honest and up front by letting them know what should have been acceptable service but I decided not to verbalize... I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt but there was not a bright spot in the service.  We were served about a 6oz cup water just after we were sat. (That water was never refilled nor asked about over the 30-45 min sit down/meal)  Ordered our app and one of the plates that came with was very dirty. It didn\u2019t look like it made it through the wash since the person before had eaten off of it. (Was not checked on, or asked \u201chow is everything\u201d)  As we ordered, the server asked if we wanted sauce on the side. We all said yes with the addition of another sauce. But when the food was delivered, all the sauce was forgotten and we had to flag them down to get assistance.  A different server brought out our meals, 2 beef burgers and one veggie burger. When they were brought out, they were unaware one was a veggie burger and didnt know it belonged.  Again. Though the whole process, we were never checked on, water refilled, confused orders, dirty plate, just zero care for their table. Perhaps it was a fluke but wow... Pretty sad.. And it may seem like I am being salty, but honestly I/we didnt ask for but we felt forgotten about. They still made more money that what was truly deserved so you can blame me for enabling poor service. Mahalo.",

Pork belly with soggy bread with a few pickles on the side for my husband. I had the kale salad...can't muck that up. All the time we were there there were outside tables available.

Excellent, 10/10 experience. . Two days later, I dragged my friends there, guessing about the pickles and beer. This time, the beer was still great but the pickles were... non-existent. Not really a problem, except the server seemed to forget to order them. Then, he told us they run out of batter. By then, my burger was cold since I'd planned to add the pickles as a topping. My friend skipped ordering because she's planned to eat the pickles that never arrived. Such a simple thing ended up as a terrible downer because the dude wasn't upfront about his failure to order to the app. . I won't go back (since I'm back to the mainland soon), but I advised you to sit at the bar where they know their business.",

Andy, the brewer who gave us the tour, did an amazing job, instilling us with a history of the brewery but also of.brewing on the island. It was perfect. Cheers! Oh... The food?

Plus, they had a couple more locally influenced beers, like the hefeweizen, which are a great spin on a traditional style.  We also tried the ahi poke, which was a good quality and fresh but simple dish.

In 2015, the famous cheese burger store GM opened their dream micro brewery \u201cWaikiki Brewing Company\u201d next to the burger store. Although it is a small space in the center of the counter, it is popular to enjoy the original crab beer that has been carefully finished. There is a brewing tank in front of the counter, and craftsmen are brewing. Hop flavor is very good. It may not be easy to meet such an attractive counter. There are 8 types of craft beer. Pale ale, IPA, porter, etc. are fully covered. I received a brown ale and a porter, but it was really fresh. It feels like drinking fresh wheat soup. Samplers are also available so you can find your favorite craft beer. There are only a few food items that are perfect for beer. The menu of the adjacent cheeseburger store can be ordered. I received an IPA for finishing, but I feel good. Perhaps it was because I was drinking at this counter wrapped in the scent of hops.
