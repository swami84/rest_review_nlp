However this day, due to the pandemic, every other spot i could think of was closed.  I had not expected this.  Fortunately Seamore's was open and the two of us sat down across from each other and took our masks off.  My friend asked if what we were doing was risky.  At first i did not know what he meant and he explained that we had our masks off and were sitting across a table from each other and were much closer than 6 feet.  We decided not to dwell on that and proceeded to order.  A very sweet and chipper hostess took our order and when my friend asked what kind of clam chowder they were serving  and the hostess answered New England - i knew that was what i wanted.  to say the least it was one of the best clam chowders i've had in a long time.  Just full of flavor.   I also had a kale and avocado salad and a terrific catch up converstion with my friend and enjoyed both immensly.",

A bit cramped on the side walk but its not their fault. The best part of our meal was the cauliflower appetizer and my gf drink (I think it was called frose;) but other than that it was subpar. Took our waiter a while to take our order and while he was taking our order, he wasn't writing anything down and i could tell a mistake was going to be made. We received our food much after others that came in after us and when we did my gf received the wrong order. I ordered the Montauk scallops and my girl got the blackened shrimp. While the entrees was presented well and tasted decent, the portion size was off and was missing some type of sauce to bring it all together, not to mention that my gfs shrimp was wildly overcooked. It was borderline closing time so we just took our Ls. Pretty certain I won't be returning.",

The food was good but the service was not that great. Yes we were there for about 2 hours but we live busy lives and wanted to catch up. I have a background of working in a restaurant while working on my MA a few years but my friends do not. In our opinion (and my expert opinion) the waiter needs to be retrained. Our waitress was not attentive and slightly rude and drop everything on the table, proper placement would have been nice. I would have given this place a 4 or 5 b.c. of scene, location and food (which needed a little more seasoning) but unfortunately she ruined our experience. Hire new waitresses that care about their job and want to provide a good experience. We still tipped her but she didn't get nearly what we originally planned to give her.",

The menu is so basic that you have to wonder whether it is devised with a trainee kirchen in mind (fish from A, sides from B). Despite this fool proof set-up the food never arrives, no matter if they are full or empty. Ravenous by this point, tears well up in your eyes as you are greeted to weightwatcher sized portions of over cooked fish, revolting dressing, and a sprinkle of sad veg. SweetGreens and Westville around the corner are gourmet by comparison. The acoustics are awful, so it is frighteningly loud with voices. Saw a manager the first night only and staff looks young. There is a demand for casual seafood restaurants, but it's hard to understand how any of the Seamores outposts stay in business if they are all this bad. Had real hopes for this addition to the neighborhood, but sadly I won't return.",
