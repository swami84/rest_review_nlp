I eat there at least once a week if not more. For starters, the Nuggets are so amazing and especially good with the HipCityVeg sauce. My favorite thing on the menu us the Jerk Cesar, it is the best Vegan salad I have ever had! I used to just get it as a side salad but once I had it with the grilled \"chicken\" I couldn't go back. Their breakfast is good also, the hashbrowns are the best!",

This area in general is a gourmet foodie delight and the competition for customers is fierce with several top of the line food places within a few blocks radius.  HipCituVeg is a vegan place primarily specializing in mock meat. They sell the impossible meat burgers, tempeh burgers and \u201cchicken\u201d fajitas among other things. The food is good but I felt the portions are relatively small. They prefer you do takeout since the seating is limited.  I tried their burger and fajita and both were very tasty.  Overall the place is great and I hope they survive the competition. There was another vegan restaurant (Native Foods) that had opened across the Connecticut Ave 5 years ago. They were a lot bigger and a lot more popular than this place but eventually closed down. I am keeping my fingers crossed that these guys survive.  The place is definitely recommended, at least as a check out.",

        "caption": "A few concerns, hopefully they will work it out and these are just new restaurant woes. First, the way they've got ordering set up, you can only see the paper menu before ordering, and it has no prices. Then they try to upsell you on things like avocado and buffalo sauce (why on Earth is buffalo sauce an extra charge???) without ever saying these things cost more or how much they cost. It's obvious avocado will cost extra but I genuinely did not expect buffalo sauce would cost extra. Second, the food was very slow to come out and there were a ton of people waiting. The sandwich was kind of a mess and not very well constructed. But this was during the lunch rush and they just opened like a week ago so I'm optimistic they'll be able to fix all that. Third is not very fixable: I did not appreciate paying $12.30 for a simple fast food chicken sandwich with no sides. I know that it's expensive because it's fake meat instead of real meat, so it's better for the environment. I actually do not believe it is any healthier in the case of chicken. I am not a vegetarian so maybe this is just targeted at people who can't have a real chicken sandwich and are so excited to have a safe kind of cheat day or something. It tastes pretty good, but I don't think it really makes sense to do this with any regularity. I imagine people from the future being like wait, people paid *extra* for the fake meat?? When real meat was available?? I would love to try the smoothies and the banana whip, but I already spent my whole lunch budget on a simple \"chick'n\" sandwich. Attaching my photo of the menu that is around the corner from where I ordered so that you can see prices if you are waiting in line and don't get tricked into paying a dollar for buffalo sauce like I did!",

Large portions and their sauces are awesome! Sweet potato fries are solid as well.  My friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich thinking it was actual chicken and liked it a lot.  They were crowded and the kitchen seemed a bit chaotic which makes sense as they are newly opened, but got my food in about 5 minutes and it was tasty. Bit pricey, but good portions.",
