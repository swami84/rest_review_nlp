Points to them for clearly outlining covid protocol when we were seated.  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  Drinks list has a great selection of cocktails, wine and beer.  Had the corn salad and tuna dip to start - both were very tasty.  Shared the pork steak, which was delicious.  My only problem with the experience was that at 8:30, after an enjoyable 90 minutes, we had another staff member come to our table with the check, telling us that we had to leave because there were people waiting for our table and that we could take our wines to go.  This was a little jarring given a) we were never told of a time limit b) had only just finished our entree and c) were considering ordering another drink and dessert.  I'll put this down to teething problems but we definitely walked away with a bit of a sour taste given the end felt so rushed.  Will try again in a few weeks when hopefully this is sorted out.",
