If I had to say what my favorite part of his pie is, it is definitely his sauce.  There is a lack of good sauce in this neighborhood imo.\u00a0 Kings of the NYC slice delivers, if you are a sauce lover..\u00a0 The sauce is perfectly spiced with herbs and not overly sweet.\u00a0 It has a little acidity that is so well balanced, it makes me want to get some extra sauce on the side just to dip my pizza crusts in.  Overall, this is a great addition to the Clinton Hill - Bed Sty community. A+ owners and fast, friendly service with a smile.\u00a0 Top notch!",
