If you're thinking traditional Mexican tacos with 3 ingredients, then maybe Pilsen is for you.  American Mexican food, Taco Bell (which sometimes is what I'm looking for).  Something new with creative combinations, Takito Street. This is upscale culinary, it is what it is.  People pay $45 for a hamburger so $4 for a taco isn't a bad deal. I don't drink, but the descriptions of the drinks makes me want to start again!",

No updated menus I wasn't sure how to use the app to download the menu and neither did our server what a joke. I wanted Korean tacos they said not today then the server came back and said yes they do have it, he lied and brought me barbacoa. Ordered drinks they didn't have the alcohol for the drink, no strawberries for my drink. Server was running up and back to the kitchen because he had no idea what was and wasn't available on the menu. It was my birthday celebration turned nightmare. Shame on you owner and train your staff.",

Will NOT go back, will not recommend!  Place has potential, but need to be more consistent. When you decide to order one more taco because it was delicious then place deserves five stars. You  expect that extra taco to be equally tasty especially if is the same kind. So when you get something that even better you're generally more happy. That is until you realize that what was served to you before was half full taco. My advise is to order fewer tacos and order more later. Otherwise they might make them smaller just to make them fit into paper tray.",
