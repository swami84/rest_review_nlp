He got the Wonton Chicken Ramen and I got the Sprouting Up Ramen. We also ordered the Takoyaki-Octopus Balls as the waiter recommended which were where very interesting. The texture was a little strange for me personally but it was good! My ramen was amazing! The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked and the broth was delicious!

Ramen is actually one of my favorite foods to try in most every city I visit. I'm usually disappointed, but not at Jinya. It's actually flavorful, and the broth isn't watery.  One thing to note: the last time I went they had a spicy scale of 1-10 to select from. It turns out 2 is like medium hot salsa, 3 is like hot salsa, and everything beyond that is straight fire. I asked for 6 and was gently (and thankfully) recalibrated.",

The noodle itself was cooked perfectly with some bite to it, and had a nice hearty consistency perfectly complimenting every flavor in the soup.

This one is specific to the kne in Alpharetta and we visited the day next to new year in the evening and it was busy as expected. I was taking my friends who were visiting from SFO. They were new to this type of food and were ready to try it. We had both vegeterian and meat eaters in the group. To my surprise this place was catering to both the types with a great menu. Special mention to the person who served us and she was great and helped the veggies with her recommendations and was able to customize it to their needs. Overall I would say this place is a must visit in Atlanta. 5 star for all categories",

The noodles were half uncooked as I could taste the uncooked bits. The veggie ramen I ordered came with 3 spinach leaves flakes and maybe half an inch of cut scallion...it was supposed to have a lot of toppings per the pics and menu description.  I can see the ready made noodles dropped in the water to be cooked. Not sure how much lazier and sloppier a ramen place can get when it's charging on the top end of ramen pricing, yet doesn't cook its own noodles and serves undercooked noodles, virtually no broth, and no toppings.  Truly, the worst ramen I ever consumed in my life. Major rip off. Like most businesses, lots of fake reviews on here, too.",

Ordered the Tonkotsu Black and suspect the bowl I got was towards the bottom of the pot. It had the consistency of thick stew and was overly chunky and salty. We ordered one croquette as well but it was still partially frozen. We got it replaced but the charge remained on our tab.  I appreciate the affirmation of my personal belief that trendy atmospheres in high traffic locations tend to deliver sub-par food experiences. Keep expectations in check if you're expecting anything similar to Japan/CA/NYC!",

In turn they had to speak over each other. There were only a few tables taken when my group was there. The employees had to announce a new patron by calling it out and every employee had to respond. Could not hear people beside me at the table unless we spoke loudly over the constant noise. It made the experience frustrating at best.
