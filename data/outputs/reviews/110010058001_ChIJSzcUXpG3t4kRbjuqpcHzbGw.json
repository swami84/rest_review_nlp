We all immediately felt unwelcome before we had even been seated. I ordered a simple grilled chicken and my group had ordered steak and fish. After taking a few bites, we had all agreed that it was just alright, but nothing that special. The food wasn't necessarily bad, but it was a little under seasoned. Overall, the dining experience wasn't terrible. The lighting was nice, slightly dim and aesthetic. I also liked the placement of the televisions throughout the restaurant. Unfortunately, staff seemed short-tempered and confused the entire time we were there. The vibe of this place was lovely and enjoyable overall, but the staff were not welcoming.  The main issue with this meal happened a few hours after we left. I felt sick almost an hour or two later and suffered terrible food poisoning that laster all night and into the morning. I wasn't able to sleep and barely pulled myself together for my flight back to Texas that morning. We all joke about this experience now but it was definitely an unpleasant one.",

The other bartender working overheard the exchange and addressed Marco about his rudeness. I overlooked it thinking Marco may be going through personal issues that are affecting his work attitude. Trying to put this unfortunate situation behind us, I reached out to Marco and told him \u201chey, we started out on a bad note, but I love you anyway\u201d.  He was not receptive. I finished my drink and ordered a second and was told I was cut off by the manager, Rachel. When I explained to her the situation she still refused to serve me a drink. As I further explained the situation, she offered a \u201cfree\u201d drink which turned out to be a small glass of something watered down. If you are in DC, beware of Marco and Rachel at Cure Bar & Bistro. It appears that the service staff can treat their customers terribly and management will support it.",

Chose 2 from the Field, Farm &Kettle: mushroom strudel topped with whipped goat cheese which turned out to be more of a savory pastry surrounding a few tablespoons of cooked mushrooms, and the asparagus salad which turned out to be 10+ spears dusted with tiny bits of gouda. From Land & Sea, chose the lobster roll which was a 5-inch perfectly cooked and overflowing gem, and the chef's creation which was a shrimp and edamame salad. Each small plate was in the 8 to 10 forkful range so lots of beautifully prepared and presented food. The mint ice tea tasted like a very minty lemonade, but only regular ice tea was available for free refills. A rather expensive meal but well worth it for the quality.",

Yes I was fighting off a cold so it was just what I needed. The soup was to my liking. All veggies were crisp and firm. The noodles were firm but well cooked. The broth was just how I like it, with lots of fresh cracked pepper. I had a flat bread pizza which was fine. The two martinis were okay, but small for the cost and measured. Other bars in the area give you significantly more value for what this place charges. They had tons of staff working so I expect that service elsewhere was good. I was at the bar so cannot comment on table service. In summary, quite good but certainly at a cost. If you are stuck in this hotel you'll be well taken care of.",
