But for the typical, chinese-american take out; this is a decent place. The vegetarian selections are very limited; which is why I give this a 3 star. They will substitute Tofu for some dishes, but they charge for it. The food is more Cantonese; so it is not spicy enough for me. The Fired Rice is over soysauced. But for what it is; I am glad this exists in Pilsen. Stay away from the Mapo Tofu. Everytime I have had it; it is not only not mala spicy; the sauce has too much cornstarch. And the spicy vegetarian dishes are not spicy but sweet-and-sour.  I usually get the regular cantonese vegetarian dishes, and add Sriracha sauce at home. Everything tastes great with the Rooster Sauce.",

For whomever may be interested, the Chef's specials do come with rice even though it's not indicated in the menu as far as I saw. They also tossed in a couple egg rolls; not sure if it was due to the amount I ordered or what, but it was a nice touch.  I give this restaurant 5 stars because the experience and food was exactly what I was looking for when I sought it out, and I even got a bit of a bonus (the egg rolls). They even have online ordering on their website, which is a nice touch (though estimated ready times on that site are longer than was estimated when I called). If I ever dine-in, I'll update with that experience.",

I got the food delivered and it came faster than expected which was awesome. I didn't eat the food right away because I wasn't on lunch. Once i got on lunch(45 minutes later) I was eating the chicken (orange chkn)and it was kind of chewy. When I cut the chicken it was pink on the inside. I immediately was so disgusted because i started looking at all the chicken i had and it was pink. I called up to the store and a lady told me that it was DONE!!!! i told her pink chicken means its not done. She told me they buy it already made and they re-fry to make it hot. I assured her that it wasn't done and that I'm looking at pink chicken. I told her she can come pick the food up im not going to eat anything else and i wanted a refund. She had an attitude and lack all customer service skills and considering the restaurant opened up not to long ago it should have been way better.",
