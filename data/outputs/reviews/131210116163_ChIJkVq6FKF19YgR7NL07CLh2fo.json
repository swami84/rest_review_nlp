They didn't have my phone number in their system because she always ordered under her phone number; therefore, they said because they were going to be closing in about 40 minutes and they didn't have my phone number in their system, they were not going to allow me to place my order. Not even if I paid for it, in advance, and then drive 5 minutes to pick it up. She said it was their policy. I have just never heard of such a policy.. not like that.. and honestly, I would totally understand if it was 10 minutes 'till closing. BUT it WASN'T! This is why I, nor my daughter, will  order from you again. You had plenty of time to cook food which takes 10 minutes to cook and I was willing to pay for it,in advance,  and even pick it ..when I originally wanted delivery. It just doesn't make any sense to me so that's that and it is what it is.. oh, and Benihana got our business.. and they even delivered and it was amazing food. Solo digo!!!",

There are 7 tables inside this restaurant which is just enough to seat 20 people inside. I got the Hibachi Chicken with Zucchini and Onions which was only $6.95. Depending on how hungry you are, the regular size could be split by two people easily! I ate half of my plate and took the other half to work the next day. I always love coming here, because the prices are cheap and the food is great! Every hibachi plate comes with yum yum sauce. Keep up the awesome work you guys!",

The rice was chewy, the steak taste like liver, and it came with about 3 pieces of zucchini (which I asked for them to substitute for onions). I would not reccomend at all, we were highly disappointed and could not even finish it.",

However, this little hidden gem is only my second \"express\" steakhouse, the first being Osakas in Lynchburg, Va.   Their is no doubt about the portion size, that everyone else is mentioning below, it is huge.  The regular size is perfect for an adult. Two children (10 and 8) can share a regular size too.  The chicken is what it is, chicken, nothing fancy. This particular restaurant clearly uses their own homemade sauce, as the chicken tasted just a little different then most places i've been to, note- that this is neither good nor bad, just different.   The yummy yummy sauce (Japanese steakhouse white sauce) had a small mayo after taste to it, which only means one of two things- either a.) they made it that day and didnt let it sit for 24 hours or b.) they didnt use Helmsmans (believe it or not, this makes a difference).   The price is great, the menu is standard hibachi, and there are about 6 tables available for eat in.  You can order the salad (with Ginger dressing) for $1.99.   I didnt see the soup that usually accompanies the meal, but I didnt really look for it either.  My only beef is - No chopsticks and homemade sweet tea (only the canned crap)----- two staples for Hibachi in my book!",
