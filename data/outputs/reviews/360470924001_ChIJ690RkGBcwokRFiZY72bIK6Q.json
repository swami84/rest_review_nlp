On Friday & Saturday's he does this amazing BBQ chicken with a secret mac and cheese. Go early because its sold out a bunch of times when I've gone in the evenings. On Saturday he does something different off the menu like wild bore, shark etc.. overall great place to eat, highly recommend!",

Support this man, this place should serve this food for the next 100 years in richmond hill.  Talking about this review is making my mouth water.  A bonus, Aneal's a friendly guy with a cool vibe.  The only other comment I have is I'm not sure if I'm getting coleslaw that is frozen when doing COVID takeaway, because it seems to taste that way...not the biggest deal for me, but maybe they could fix that (if it's actually frozen)",

We could tell a lot of regulars come back often, which is a testament to how good the food is here.  Saw someone have the ribs mac and cheese, and was immediately jealous. I will have to come back on a Saturday to try it out! Also making a note to try the shark sandwich too!",

Taste, the bake is nice and fluffy, large chunks of shark meat, coleslaw toppings, a touch of hotsauce and I add a splash of my homemade tamarind chutny to make a wonderful combination of flavours that instantly takes you back to the Caribbean.

Would definitely visit again in the near future.",

Rice is a abit hard and that is something someone else mentioned about the rice being a bit hard. The rice is not cheap rice but not cooked properly, also missing coconut milk in the recipe. The chicken is cooked but not delicious, KFC taste better. Chicken need to be more close to fall of the bone. Need to put more gravy in rice.Coleslaw is alright.  I had food from Cravins last week and their food blow this food out of the water.  Another good jerk place is Gems in Brampton.",

This time when when we came I decided to try something different and the Shark N' Bake always caught my eye when I saw it in pictures posted.   Wow!!!  Why did I wait so long to try it? I definitely found my new favourite dish. The flavours came out in every bite.  Aneal Looking are looking forward to coming back in a couple weeks.   The SharkNBake was absolutely outstanding!

Great service and friendly staff, parking is available in a public space in the back area, approx 3min walk.  The jerk chicken had a beautiful color and it was juicy and tender. The sweet and spicy marinade coated the chicken evenly and it was a perfect combination with the ghost pepper hot sauce (they will ask you if it's your first time at their restaurant to ensure you are aware of their spice levels). It was amazing. Rice and peas were perfectly cooked and loved the addition of bay leaves to lift the aromas. The taste was authentic.  Clean dining area and they also have a Shark meat sandwhich, available on fridays only.  Thank you for the great meal!",

We had the curry goat dinner; it was tender, flavourful and a generous portion. Coleslaw is nice and creamy. The ghost pepper hot sauce is amazing! That hotness will linger and build for sure but it also has a nice bright flavour right at the beginning. Will definitely make a point to eat here whenever we're in the area next!",

Unlike other such eateries where the meat is cooking until it is overly soft the curry goat here has a nice texture. The rice is equally good but the best part was the refreshing fresh coleslaw that is usually neglected in Caribbean restaurants and doesn't taste as good.  On the down side the prices are higher than the competition (they've gone up from the images you can find online) and the portions are significantly smaller than the competition. What's more, the eatery doesn't serve hot sauce on the side for diners who want more heat.  When I asked for salt I felt like I was asking for a big favor so that's why I hesitated to ask for more hot sauce.  Despite these issues I did have a positive experience overall, thanks to the quality of the food and ingredients. I'm still left feeling hungry, though,  despite spending more than other Caribbean places.",

I had ordered the jerk chicken and the stewed oxtail as well but it was so good I forgot to take a photo. I wish there was a restaurant like this in Calgary.

While I waited for my meal to arrive, he greeted every customer as if they were family. The food arrived piping hot...both temperature and deliciously spicy.  This may be the only West Indian restaurant in the immediate area, but well worth the trip even if you're not from Richmond Hill. So far, my wife and I have tried: Chicken roti, shrimp roti, catfish, oxtail, jerk chicken, and doubles. I can honestly say, everything has tasted magnificent.  Full of delicious flavour, ample serving size, comfortable dine-in, and customer service that other places could take a lesson from. Without a doubt, highly recommended!  Give this place a visit...you will love it if you enjoy great food!",

Aneal is friendly, always happy to see him, there's no better feeling than being on a first name basis with local businesses. He knows I love my food extra spicy and delivers every time.

I was trying to take a train home from Toronto to Hamilton, but ended up on the wrong last train into the area and had no way of getting back home. I was told by one of the local bus drivers that if I kept walking down Yonge Street I'd eventually end up at Finch's station. When I rolled into this restaurant I already felt a sense of familiarity unmatched by most places. Aneal was talking comfortably to his customers, laughing and joking with them, and honestly it made me feel at ease despite my situation. When I went up to order, I didn't feel rushed at all, which as somebody who takes a long time to order is usually a huge factor about how I feel about a restaurant. The meal I got (boneless jerk chicken, amazing mind you) was more than what I paid for, and the food was definitely of high quality. As somebody who grew up in the Caribbean. the food brought me back home. While eating and getting settled as Aneal was closing up shop, he noticed that I wasn't from around Richmond Hill. He took time to notice that I wasn't a familiar face. I told him my situation, and to my surprise he offered me a ride to the GO station close to his home. Aneal, thank you for being a wonderful human being. I hope you and your restaurant flourish, you and your family deserve nothing but praises.",
