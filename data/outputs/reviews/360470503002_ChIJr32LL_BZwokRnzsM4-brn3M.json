I love that this place is not fussy or pretentious. But it is also not a bullet proof glass take out joint. It's just about the food and the staff is very positive as well. I really enjoyed the classic soul and R&B they were playing. In contrast to the hipster tunes or top 40 you often hear at most places. Nice atmosphere, and not too crowded for a smaller place. I suppose they do a lot of takeout business? On to the food. Everything I have tried here is excellent. It is right on that line between ordinary and fusion. Some ingredients are a little different. But for the most part it's what you expect from a Chinese place. Except vegetarian. I appreciate that the spicy dishes aren't watered down. They have actual heat and bite. Plenty of flavor. Admittedly I'm ecstatic over this place because I no longer have to go all the way into Manhattan for vegetarian dim sum. Plan on trying the entire menu eventually! I'm going to rope in my Brooklyn friends for meals at this place whenever we are in the area. Support your vegetarian businesses!",
