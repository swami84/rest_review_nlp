        "caption": "Ummmmmm their wings are so bomb! I always order the sweet cajun wings flavor. You get 10 pieces for like $11 and it's worth it, because you also get celery and carrot stix included with your order. I highly recommend it. Actually we are ordering about 40 to 50 wings for a work event and it's all because their wings are that good in flavor and crisp and everything is just always on point hands down. I hope they open up a wing plus by my house!  My co worker comes here everytime after work and gets herself her regular wings. She's a regular customer, that's how often she goes there and now I understand why.",

Otherwise the menu pricing is good and the place looks well kept and clean. And the lady at the counter was patient and friendly.",
