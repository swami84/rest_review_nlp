Two of us are big eaters and we ordered 3: triple threat, spicy tonkotsu, and spicy tantanmen, with an extra egg, chili, ginger, and spring onion. Also, get the Japanese soda, it\u2019s good.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and just right for biting and the broth was so balanced and precise that makes you crave for one more spoon each time. The star of the night was the chashu, which was a thick cut and tasted heavenly! The Menma bamboo shoot tasted different to us in each bowl and it was a refreshing contrast.  Our favorite was the triple threat because of the depth of the broth and the thickness of the noodles. The second favorite was spicy tonkotsu. And while the tantanmen was really good too, we thought that the broth was a bit salty (note that we were the last table to order that night and the broth was properly more dense at that time).  From greeter to server, the service seems consistently good. The dreamy indie pop music was a nice touch but the speaker was a bit not clear enough in the bass.  It was a delight and I really enjoy writing this long review for this place. Love it and I will definitely return when I\u2019m in DC!",

The Vegan Classic was pretty well seasoned, and the mouthfeel of the broth felt surprisingly substantial without being too heavy. However, it lacked depth and offered little beyond tasting salty. The Vegan Spicy Tantan Men had a good level of heat to it, but again lacked a depth of flavor in the broth. It was hard to even pick out the taste of the sesame paste. I appreciated the house-made noodles which were thin and stayed chewy in the broth.  By far the most disappointing aspect of each bowl was the toppings. The mushrooms' natural flavors were drowned out by the broth. Despite their considerable size, it felt like they only served as a textural addition to the dishes. Only the nori and pickled ginger cut through the broth to add a welcome burst of additional flavor.  While I truly appreciate ramen shops offering vegan bowls on the menu, they typically feel like an afterthought compared to other bowls. Unfortunately, Menya Hosaki's offerings are no different.",

The prices range from $15 to $18 with additional costs for add-ons.  I ordered the dan dan noodle inspired ramen and it came with a spice kick. I ordered an extra egg and noodles and it was very filling. The bamboo and egg inside the ramen were divine.  My wife and housemate ordered the classic shoyu and were split on it.
