The manager told me it was going to get here in 5 minutes. After 30m I called and he  said the delivery guy was just leaving the store. The food got here an hour after, it was cold, but not only that they were 3 items missing from my order. I paid almost 40 and only got 20 worth of food. My boyfriend was so mad that he couldn\u2019t move the car to go to the store so he had to take an Uber back and fourth to get the food that they missed in our order, he ended up paying 18 for the taxi which is unacceptable because I called the delivery guy like 10 times for him to come back with the missing food and he kept hanging up on me because it wasn\u2019t \u201chis problem\u201d anymore.

After the 20 minutes they hung up the phone on me with no help.I literally has to leave my home at 1 in the morning after waiting since 10pm to pick up the pizza personally.When I arrived at the 167th Domino's location the associates checked and found my 2 boxes sitting there for over 3 hours with absolutely no explanation and they were not helpful at all..

I waited for like an hour & thirty minutes, when I check the app it said that the pizza was already delivered. So I decided to call & the girl whom I spoke to lacked customer service & didn\u2019t care much about the situation. She stated that the pizza was just made & it was going out for delivery in a few minutes. When I check the app again the order was not found. After that I called again & after being put on hold for thirty minutes by the same girl. The manager stated that they canceled the order & that the delivery guy went home. He stated that he called me multiple times which was a lie because I had my phone all night & I know it was working because I was using the same number to call them.  The manager never bothered to call to inform us that the pizza would not be delivered, he just left it up to us to find out. Another thing was that the delivery guy had my apartment number & if I supposedly didn\u2019t pick up the phone he could\u2019ve went upstairs with the pizzas. No one rung the intercom last night. I was left disappointed & so was everyone at the party. We waited a long time to eat & everyone went home hungry. The kids were waiting on it, that was the reason their parents stood a bit late & for nothing.",

I dont know why I\u2019m writing this ??? In order for this location to work as any other dominos in the world everyone here needs to be fired and hire new employees who care, don\u2019t even ask for the manager he\u2019s whose responsible for this joke of a restaurant.
