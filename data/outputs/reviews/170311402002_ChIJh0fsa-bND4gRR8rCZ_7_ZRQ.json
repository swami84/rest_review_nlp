Upon standing by the window, I could see an employee moping the floor. I waited a minute or so and then proceeded to knock. The kid continued to mop the floor. After waiting a couple more minutes I saw there was a whiteboard laying flat on their counter that read \"closed\". Rather than inform me so I didn't waste their or my time, the kid chose to ignore me. I should also add that the time was 3pm... I worked at a number of different coffee shops over the course of four years, never would I allow one of my employees to act as ignorant. I wouldn't recommend tipping if you choose to visit this location.",
