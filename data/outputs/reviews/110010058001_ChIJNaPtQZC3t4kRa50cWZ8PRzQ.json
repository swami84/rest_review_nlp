The bar offers both cocktail flights as well as a la carte options and their drinks range from classic to modern. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have time to do the cocktail flight, but we were still able to sample some of their innovative cocktails like the Floral Cloud cocktail with gin, lemon, cr\u00e8me de violette, maraschino and hibiscus cloud, and the Divine Wind cocktail with chrysanthemum Shochu, orange liqueur, butterfly pea, citrus singani and according to them, even magic. They also have inventive bar snacks like the waffle with A1 wagyu and the bartenders are really friendly and attentive. DC may not be the most exciting city when it comes to food and drinks and this place may be on the pricier side, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking out. Just make sure you reserve ahead of time because we saw people waiting for seats even at 11pm on a Tuesday.",

We entered a white draped room before being brought into the cooking and eating room. There was a large staff of chefs and attendants, busily preparing for the seating. A total of 12 places were available at the L-shaped bar. Patrons were from multiple states and countries. In total there were over 2 dozen exquisitely crafted tastes, paired with beverages from non alcoholic to multiple levels of wine. The seating took approximately 2 hours, and included a visit to the attached minibar. Minibar offered a similar level of cocktails, plus is where a dessert vessel and the final check was delivered with its own flair. A once in a lifetime experience.",

We had all of our senses tested that day. From smoked filled potions of perfume to fire blazed smoked drinks to a drink made with nitrogen and one that was like a gelatin ball. It was incredible. The service was excellent. We also ordered the grilled cheese with honey mustard which was very good as well. Think of an upscaled grilled cheese with some special cheese cut in squares.

While most bars are dark and loud this place was much more like a high end lounge with lots of small seating areas to relax and be comfortable with your party and have some space compared to many other places.  It's all about the experience.  Our server was fantastic and explained exactly what each drink was before making most of them in front of us or showing us how to do a small step or two as part of the process.  While $95 might seem like a steep price, I can promise you at this worth it for the unique flavors and the vibes if that's something you appreciate.",

Don't be discouraged at being turned away at the door as this is a small bar that typically has a weeks or months long wait list. If you happen to be alone you may be lucky at the door to get a seat at the bar otherwise utilize the online reservation system for a date in the future. You will not regret it and it will leave you wanting more. for an extra special experience I would recommend purchasing one of their many cocktail flight experiences be it their standard or one of many bespoke experiences offered during the year. The place is run like a top and you'll love the atmosphere that combines ultra-modern chic with elements of whimsy throughout. Cheers \ud83d\ude09",

One of my friends was visiting from out of town and Barmini was recommended by one of my coworkers as a great spot to hit up for a special occasion. We arrived at 8 pm and were immediately greeted with an introductory cocktail to begin the evening.  We started with the foieffle which was incredible. The peanut butter and foie gras mixed together harmoniously and the waffle quite literally melted in your mouth.  Fresh off of the foieffle, we decided to order the waffle flight because we wanted to try the other waffles. I enjoyed all three but my favorites were the Philly and the foieffle.  The grilled cheese was also a good small plate to indulge in before drinks (or was it in between?).  I ordered the Cross-Eyed Mary and the Floral Cloud, both of which were fantastic. The Cross-Eyed Mary had a fruity whipped topping and the Floral Cloud was quite honestly one of the best drinks I've ever had. There was a hibiscus \"cloud\" placed on the drink before it was served to me and every time I took a sip, I was experiencing a symphony of smell (hibiscus) and taste (the floral drink) all at once.  My friend ordered the Divine Wind and one of the tiki cocktails. Both were very good. We were also given some sort of other drink served in a rocket ship which was out of this world. Sorry, I had to make the joke.  Prices are steep for the drinks but I think the experience was totally worth it.",

There is extreme attention to detail, hyper knowledgeable staff, and an overly curated collection of weird seating and tchotchkes. But the options are a myriad of spirits, visual and taste combinations, and delivery. The staff know what they are doing. The space is comfortable and interesting (and offers many Instagram opportunities). I have never had a bad experience here, but one should recognize that it is less a bar and more like going to a restaurant. You are out when your reservation ends. The bar menu is small, but offers an interesting variety. Not many vegan options and you aren't going to get full here (unless you want to spend a lot of money). Plan to go before or after dinner.

I saw a bartender making cocktails that smoked so much it looked like they had dry ice in them, and he had a whole mad scientist getup. It was a joy watching him make my cocktail to tell you the truth, just the presentation alone lead me to believe that this was a great cocktail even before I tried it. The service was also stellar. My only complaint is really about the food.  The food isn't exactly the cheapest stuff around and that is a bit of bummer because I got what felt like appetizers when I felt like I had paid enough for a huge quarter pounder.",

They started us with a small \"welcome\" cocktail that had a cucumber flavor. The cocktail menu is extensive (roughly 100 maybe?). The ones I tried were very smooth but the pumpkin one I had barely tasted like pumpkin. The appetizer plates were delicious such as the liquid olive and grilled cheese. The service was excellent and very friendly. Overall, a solid way to experience a small bit of the more expensive sister place next door.",

However I wouldn't go in with the expectations for fine dining experience as most dishes are more like upscale bar food. The food menu clearly shows its effort of bringing in interesting twists and probably resonating the experience next door at mini bar. But some soundingly interesting dishes came out rather underwhelming like the uni panini and lobster roll. Not sure if i would bother with the troublesome reservation process here on a regular basis, but I'd recommend if there's a special occasion or you have a foodie guest in town and you want to show them the dc dining experience.",

We came over here for some cocktails and to try their innovative tapas. I went for a double rum combination (double something) and I must say it was quite on the top (maybe too much alcohol for me). We ordered the lobster roll (yummy) and the cheese sandwich. I did love the lab ambiance as well as the exquisite service (a bit too snooty at the beginning).
