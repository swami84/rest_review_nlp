Her response was \u201cthan u should have told me before so u won\u2019t sit here\u201d As she started speaking to us in the beginning the whole time was just attitude. When I did my order there was a side dish of salad. I asked her if it was possible to have an avocado salad instead, she said no. I did tell her all I want was the avocado added so she had told me let me ask. First 3.00 for added avocado was ridiculous and second it wasn\u2019t even half of an avocado. Other than that the cook who did the presentation was very kind smiley and respectful. Sadly towards the end as I finished paying a big roach had fallen from the ceiling into my spot of the table exactly where my plate was sat. If I wouldn\u2019t have finished ,it would have fallen into my plate. As I was leaving I did tell the Same waitress who was giving us attitude in the beginning. Not even a refund or apology for the incident that occurred ,but all she did was get the broom and picked it up after my husband had removed the roach near my child. Which also the 4 ladies on the other side of the table had seen what had happened and had gotten so disgusted and upset. Sadly to say but I also wish they were alittle more clean. I will definitely not return to this place.",

We didn\u2019t want to argue so we said that was fine but that we preferred something else. I also stated the bottom of my plate was dirty and even showed her. She then yanked the plate out of my hand and that\u2019s when my girlfriend and I got up, paid for what we did eat, and left. I will never be returning here.

To be very clear, this restaurant is NOT the former. This is no gourmet, Japanese style artfully crafted environment. With that being said, if your looking to go out for sushi and an experience moderately about the offering of your typical pan-asian sushi delivery options at an affordable yet surprisingly delicious standard, Natto is a great choice for doing so.",

Worship the guy\u2019s whole calatlog. Where he goes I follow, because he\u2019s got an eye for quality that\u2019s unsurpassed.  As per usual, he did not lead me astray. One filet mignon and shrimp combo later, I was in hibachi heaven. Combine that with a firehouse of sake to the face and I\u2019ve been transported to cloud nine. Nothing better, second year in a row.  I\u2019m a man who values value, and at Natto I was not dissapointed. It\u2019s essentially ruined all other culinary experiences for me. Quite frankly, if a vegetable is thrown into my mouth, I\u2019m no longer consuming it. Sorry, Mom.  5/5, two thumbs up, and one full stomach later I\u2019m a happy camper.  Thanks enthusiastic and attentive staff of Natto. And thank you a thousand times, fellow reviewer Scott Matus. You\u2019re my North Star, my shining light, my Buddha-bellied mentor and I, as always, will follow you to the ends of the earth.",

Dese confirmed and asked me to make sure that everyone is on time at 7:30 to be seated.  ALL GUESTS show up and are outside at 7:20. I walk in and the place if filled. I go to Dese and ask what's going on?  She does not apologize or give ANY help, asks \"Is everyone here?\" I replied, \"Are you kidding, look outside.\" She then leaves to talk to other people.  After waiting 20 minutes, she offers a table for eight people. I ask her what is the rest of the group supposed to do? She replies, \"It's ok.\"  I am not a violent person but I wanted to physically harm her at that point. I was 45\u00b0 outside and my friends were waiting outside for half an hour after confirming three times with this person.  DO NOT GO HERE.  GO TO THE SUSHI PLACE ACROSS THR STREET.  Food is good, service is unbelievably great PLUS THEY ARE HONEST.",
