        "caption": "Since COVID, my wife and I do not go out to eat. Today, however, was our Anniversary and we decided to make an exception and to go to Sottosale. Why? Because they deliver! Not to our home, silly. Ivo is an amazingly outstanding Chef. Mario, the Manager, provides warmth, levity, and professionalism to the front of the house. Everyone there is COVID compliant. It seems like they have expanded the quasi-covered garden area to accommodate more seating, and the tables are separated far apart. But I digress. Now for the food! We began tonight's meal with spaghetti cacio e pepe, an item not on the regular menu, but Ivo made it for us. The pasta was a perfect al dente coated with cheesy, peppery goodness! And the portion was huge! My wife had her favorite dish on the menu, the signature Branzino Sottosale, the restaurant's namesake, which quite literally means \"Under Salt\". This delectable fish was first wrapped in a banana leaf, then crusted with salt, and baked in a wood burning pizza oven. Then, the server brings it tableside, cracks open the salt shell, and serves this moist, delicious fish without the head, skin, or bones. The side dish was grilled asparagus, perfectly cooked, slightly crunchy. Tons of flavor! I ordered the pasta special for my main course, spaghetti with clams, mussels, bottarga, and asparagus in a white wine sauce. The bottarga gave it just that extra something to let it taste even more of the sea...not fishy. I savored every bite! For dessert, we enjoyed their Coppa Sottosale, three scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and nuts. We ordered a side of Nutella, just because! Sottosale is the bees knees, a beautiful oasis in a decidedly urban section of town. Oh, you can also buy the wine on the menu by the bottle from there! As many times as we have recommended this restaurant, we have always gotten rave reviews, and I echo that sentiment this evening.",

Dined in a small yet quaint outdoor terrace area, with string lighting and pleasant decor. Mario was the server and was very engaging without being overbearing. Food was absolutely delicious, from the appetizer to the Lobster Ravioli, which was one of the specials that night. Everything is CLEARLY made fresh and the pricing is impressive. One more thing - this place takes the CDC recommendations amidst the COVID-19 crisis very responsibly and seriously, which was an added plus. Can't go wrong here, either for a casual dinner or for a special night out.",

Dined in a small yet quaint outdoor terrace area, with string lighting and pleasant decor. Mario was the server and was very engaging without being overbearing. Food was absolutely delicious, from the appetizer to the Lobster Ravioli, which was one of the specials that night. Everything is CLEARLY made fresh and the pricing is impressive. One more thing - this place takes the CDC recommendations amidst the COVID-19 crisis very responsibly and seriously, which was an added plus. Can't go wrong here, either for a casual dinner or for a special night out.",
