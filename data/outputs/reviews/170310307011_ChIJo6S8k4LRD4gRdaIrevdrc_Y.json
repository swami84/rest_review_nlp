We thought they had bubble tea, apparently we tried 2 of their \"fragrant\" teas (because our server couldnt explain what they were and what the options were - apparent language barrier which I usually dont mind but it definitely affected our service) and had to add boba for 50 cents (which they ran out of shortly thereafter). The fragrant teas were absolutely disgusting, I got the lychee and it tasted like perfume loaded with sugar, the strawberry tea was also loaded with sugar, the give you a headache amount of sugar.  They wouldn't refund or replace them (later the server did say they only charged us for 1 which was appreciated)  The appetizers were all bare bones and lacked flavor/presentation, not cooked well or overcooked. The sushi/rolls werent too bad. Very little checking in from servers/staff throughout the stay. Unenjoyable experience overall and would not recommend, go elsewhere and save your money.",

The side salad was super crisp and the dressing was great. We both got the sushi lunch with spicy tuna roll. It was fresh and delicious! I just wished I took a photo. We will be back in a few weeks and plan to order again. My friend got the mango bubble tea with an herbal jelly in it.  She really liked and enjoyed the drink. Since we ate in the car it was nice that the clear take out container was sturdy and snapped shut for clean up and keeping the extra dipping sauce inside and not spill out. The menu was full of choices and they make typical Chinese food too. I will be back!",

We are from Toronto, Canada where we have all you can eat Sushi restaurants a dime a dozen. Each one of them are competing with each other on their quality of food. The sushi, sashimi and all the dishes served there are authentic Japanese. Alas the food here at Blowfish is from a completely different planet and no where close to 50% authentic. The sushi rice was terrible, the sashimi did not look very fresh, the tempura batter was not tempura batter, the pork dumplings were made from a frozen packet, the miso soup was something totally NOT miso soup. With all the good reviews we thought  we were getting really good food and we ordered portions like we order in Canada, but it was so terrible that we could not finish the food as it was not palatable. Either the people who posted the good reviews have not eaten genuine Sushi in their lives or the food today was horrible. I'm not coming back for a second chance to try this place. Good Luck.",

The shrimp fried rice had plenty of shrimp but the cooking of the rice to make brown rice was done very poorly with no flavor of the sauce. The dish was overall bland and had multiple spots that were overcooked to the point of being mushy. The chicken teriyaki was very bland, the chicken was not fresh but that of frozen chicken breast. The sauce used was not teriyaki sauce, but caramelized sweetened soy sauce. The cucumber roll was not made properly and came unrolled in the container during delivery. The food was at least edible which is why it was not given a one. I honestly do not know if corners are just being cut to save  on expenses, or if it was the time I ordered my food which was kind of late 9 p.m. This is just what I have dealt with. Not the worse but definitely far from the best. Make of this review what you will and decided for yourself.",

That is a real odd thing. I am used to going to those since I love sashimi and they are so expensive that all you can eat is the best way to get some sashimi fix.  We were starved and we started to get some appetizers and the sushi orders going.  HOT SAKE- they have a half price house sake and it is very worth it for 2 people so keep that are sake both in mind at the date night. specially on the colder days get that hot sake.  SHUMAI - they here steam the shumai I was not a huge fan of it since I can steam shumai at home.  OCTOPUS- is was super rubbery I do not recommend this appetizer at all.  CRAB RAGOON- idk if that was crab of just cream cheese but if it was a crab lagoon it s a lie. Did not taste any.  SASHIMI- it was not the freshest sashimi I have ever had but it was eatable. you will be able to tell is frozen for sure.  SUSHI (ANY OF THEM)- the reason I say is because the rice encasing all the sushi we had tasted HORRIBLE, DRY AND FLAVORLESS. It was not something I wanted to eat at all so we ended up leaving a lot of the sushi because we could not eat it. It was truly horrible.  To close our night at this place, they charged us a 7 dollar fee for not finishing the disgusting sushi, when we told them why we didn\u2019t eat they STILL charged us.  now I understand why this place was so empty when we came in. No wonder nobody really comes here. I do not recommend this place all.",

They always have all you can eat for about $20.00 and it is from a somewhat limited menu of appetizers, rolls, sushi and sashimi. It's a great place to go when you are jonesing for classic sushi - the pieces on the all you can eat menu are slightly smaller, so it helps you not go completely overboard.  The staff pays attention and when it looks like you are about to finish your platter they offer another menu, so if you start conservatively you can definitely order more.  There is another menu that is more like a typical sushi restaurant menu. I've been many times and enjoy the good service and nice sushi.",
