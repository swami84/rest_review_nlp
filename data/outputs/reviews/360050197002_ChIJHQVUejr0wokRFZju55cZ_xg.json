The worst wings I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire lifetime smelled like chicken/looked uncooked/the hot sauce tasted disgusting and it was literally 10 pieces of (5) wings chopped up for $10 bucks. The cheese pie wasn\u2019t the worst but it really was more dough than anything cheap on sauce and cheese. The garlic knots were extremely greasy and did not taste like garlic at all. The beef patty was \u201cok\u201d according to my friend. Overall, this was a really a bad choice to get food from. I would love to add pictures to this review but it\u2019s not allowing me. Oh and the worst part is we called to complain and the person who answered refused to help and hung up on me.",

With a sarcastic attitude he says \"ok anything else\" and I say something else I wanted. He rushes to get my address and hangs up on me when I'm not even done. I called him back to ask for my soda and in a really sarcastic way says \"it's a lot of things you want to order\" and when I ask why is he so sarcastic with me he hangs up on me again. This is unacceptable as you shouldn't treat your customers this way. Like we are generating income for your business and you're going to treat us like that. Last time we ordered from there, the pizza was good. We had gotten extra cheese, but it looked like it was a regular cheese pie. I called to tell the person in charge and they argue to me that its extra cheese. Today we decided to give another chance to the restaurant and get treated like this. Definitely never ordering from there again. Felt like calling and cancelling the order just for him being rude.",
