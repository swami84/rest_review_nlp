And the manager refused to cancel it and offered to make it less spicy. What I got after they made it less spicy was too sweet. So really didn't have great food here. If you don't like spicy, hot food don't go here. Also they added a mandatory 10% 'gratuity fee' in the bill which i felt should have been made as a choice to the user and not as mandatory. Too hot food, not so helpful staff. Avoid eating in this place.",

Today I had the curry chicken and it did not taste like what a general \u201cCurry Chicken\u201d suppose to taste like. It had no taste of chicken. They basically cooked tomato and chicken together. When asked to change it they brought the same thing with less tomato on it. It was disgusting. The waiter was very rude, he acted like he didn\u2019t know what I was trying to say. #Never Going",

Sure enough, no plates, utensils or napkins.    Some of the complaints said there was too little food, but my containers were full to the brim and I felt overfull and sleepy at the end of my lunch so I'd say they give a generous portion.  However, I did NOT order from the lunch menu as my item wasn't one of the choices.  The menu didn't tell you that you get a whole naan with entrees, so I ordered an extra naan off the menu.  I had two HUGE naan breads to deal with (I could have saved $3). An entree,  sweet lassi, extra naan and $5 tip, my lunch cost $29.  That's a bit high for the area, but I feel like I got my money's worth.",

I told them I just wanted a clean plate, there was no protocol for them seemingly for situations like this as all he could do was be defensive. Then it was sort of just a \"okay, yeah, we'll redo it attitude.\" Even though I clearly said just bring me a different plate. Anyhow, the dish came again. There was never an apology, not from this server or the one who took our check. It was ridiculous. As great as the food was, I am more than likely not going to go there again.",

Maybe for those who dont know the \"authentic taste of East Indian Food\" will review and rate this food as Delicious, but it is far from it.  The Service is very lackluster and they are clearly unorganized, don't pay attention to their customers and need to learn to cook Indian Food.  Dont go there and waste your money or your time.  They couldn't even get the Lime Aid drink correct.  Pathetic place and if i could give them Zero Stars I would.  Horrible Experience at an Indian Restaurant Ever.",

It was a big disappointment for all of us. Because according to the review from the people, they had some good foods we wanted to try out. However, It wasn\u2019t like what we expected. Also, the place is really unorganized and needs a strong management to keep the store clean and organized. When we entered the restaurant it was a mess like all wind from outside went inside of the restaurant and that wasn\u2019t welcoming at all lol. Even tho we went in to try out anyway. So we ordered what the person showed us. It was like a combo- for example, Two entree\u2019s with rice and nan. the we had are -  1) Vindaloo Chiken, I believe. 2) Chicken Curry. 3) Chicken Tikka Masala.  The rice was good. The Nan please that was embarrassing. What was the chef thinking? Who makes nan like that? rubbery tastes bland flat as a roti. It totally pissed me off. Okay moving on to next-  First- Chicken curry what can I say. The curry was was good honestly but the chicken comon it\u2019s too DRY!!!!! Why u do this?  Next- Vindaloo Chicken It was ruined. Over spiced with clove and other spices. Could have been better.  lastly- Chicken Tikka Masala. Now that was good ! but lacks a little salt/flavor. Could be better. But man the chicken mad dry.  If the chicken is overcooked it comes dry because it doesn\u2019t have any fat.  This place can be way better if everybody cares what they doing specially the food. The kitchen needs focus more on what and how they cooking. The ingredients needs The service needs to be better.  Based on other \u201cGood\u201d reviews, what I have experienced is nothing compared to what I read.  Will visit next time if the restaurant makes improvement. Until then I am off. This restaurant has good potential if everyone cares. Specially the Engine room of the restaurant.",

I have probably ordered their chicken tikka masala four or five times in a row, without ordering anything else. It is that good. It is the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had. My boyfriend is West Indian, he's had his fair share of Indian food however he also agreed this is probably the best. The sauce is just so good. And the hot naan is so chewy and soft, which makes it perfect for dipping. We also got the samosas. Also delicious. For lunch you can expect to pay over $20 for a meal so it's not cheap, but you can tell there's quality in the food. I will not be able to go to this place everyday, but it is an enjoyable experience.",

        "caption": "So tonight's meal @ Curry Heights started out with me not receiving any water even as the delicious Vege samosa was served.  As I watched the two gentlemen next to me be served water, I was like maybe this is just an oversight.  When my Chicken Vindaloo, Navaratan Korma, and Garlic Naan (which were fantastic!!) arrived, I asked for water.  I was given water  (refilled throughout meal), but no  apology was offerred.  So I'm thinking to myseld, \"Don't trip, maybe its just cultural.\"  I continue to enjoy my meal and after I am done, the waiter asks me to pay in cash because the machine was down for a half hour.  They said I could even pay less.  I said hmmm ok and complete my transaction in cash.  However, I observe the same two gentlemen, who happened to be white, have their cards taken without question.  After their transaction, I ask the two gentlemen if the servers had requested that they pay in cash and they tell me no.  So I wait until the two gentlemen leave and summon the waiter over and ask if there is a reason why the two gentlemen were allowed to pay with card while I was told the machine was down for a half hour.  The waiter told me that Im making a big deal out of nothing and that they would have take my card.  So I stated but you said the machine had been down. That's when he proceeded to wag his finger in my face and speak to me like I am his child.  I stood up and responded why are you pointing your finger at me when you are the one giving preferential treatment to other people.  My review of this establishment is terrible service at best.....racist at worst",
