I love the service and the staff. They are very friendly and if you go a few times they definitely recognize you. The pho has a ton of flavor even when you don't add the extra sauces and veggies. Their egg rolls, SPRING ROLLS, and crab rangoon are amazing as well. Their peanut sauce for the spring rolls is one of my favorites to get. I highly recommend trying this place out!",

This place is pretty decent for pho or banh cuon. Like most other asian places the services is just ok and the place is not the cleanest, but if you're here for good and cheap eats then this is your place.  Update Oct.2018: We still frequent this spot in the neighborhood!  The staff is nice and more importantly, food is always consistent and fast! prices are good too. Bo Luc Lac is a must try, as well as the pork vermicelli bowl.  VN eggrolls are great too.",
