Asked server and she said meal would be right up. 15 minutes later - still nothing. Finally spoke to manager and they never told us what happened but we had to take it to go because we only had an hour. Server never even asked if she could refill our drinks during this entire time. Comped us our soft drinks whoopie! Food was adequate but service was about as bad as it gets. At least check on us once in a while please.",

This place is definitely Michelin star prices. We had a reservation at 11:45am. We were kind of on time, 5 mins early. We sat down around 11:40am. Soon after we finished eating, a lady come by our table and told us we have to leave(around 12:30pm). The restaurant was busy, but it was not like that's no empty table. She made us feel like we did something wrong like we were there for too long. We were only there for 50 mins.  If we were there and not buying, I can understand. But our bill was $67 for the three of us. We asked why we have to leave right the way, and she told us there was a computer problem and they were overbooked. But when we walk out, there was no line and there was empty tables. If you are looking for a nice sit down place, it is not the place you want to go, as there's a timer on every table. If you are looking for place to eat quick, you can go somewhere cheaper.",

Our server was very attentive and took and brought our drinks right away as well as took our lunch orders. The space was a little dark but pretty quiet and great for lunch conversation with clients or coworkers. Our lunch was delicious - I had the salmon bento box and my coworker had the strip steak bento box. The food was well portioned and freshly prepared. We were not rushed out of the restaurant and I fully enjoyed our meal. I would definitely go back.",

The executive chef came to our table several times to see how we were doing and personally made us some yummy dishes to try that we hadn't ordered. Later we moved to the bar area and when our friend showed up to eat but the kitchen had already closed. The chef was walking out the door with his jacket and backpack for the night. He put everything down went into the kitchen and made 3 of the most delicious hand rolls for him at no charge. He said everyone deserves a good meal. We could not have had better service or a more delicious meal. It's a popular lunch spot so it was nice to have a quiet dinner with star treatment. I highly highly recommend!",

        "caption": "My wife and I brought our 6- and 10-year-old daughters to Chicago for spring break. We decided to check out AraOn because it's right across the street from the JW Marriott where we're staying.  When we first walked in, the hostess came across as ever so slightly condescending when she asked if we had reservations - it was Monday night at about 8, and the place was *maybe* half full. She seated us, and she came back to take our order a few minutes later. I asked my wife if she was getting a weird vibe from the hostess/waitress, and my wife had the same impression I did. Nothing overt, but definitely a weird sort of \"looking down her nose\" feeling.  We started with edamame for us, miso soup for my oldest daughter. The owner of the place came out to bring the edamame, and he was incredibly kind and gracious. The edamame was salted with the standard sea salt, and also spiced with a red crushed pepper. They were very good.  I ordered the Sushi Combo Platter ($26) listed as \"chef's selection of 6 pieces of nigiri and a spicy tuna maki.\" My wife ordered the Miso Yaki salmon bento box ($23). My 10-year-old daughter asked for crab rangoon for her entree, and my 6-year-old just wanted mac and cheese, so we ordered the smoked cheddar and bacon mac and cheese.  The owner came out again to deliver the crab rangoon, and he brought an extra plate for my youngest - great touch to keep the kids from fussing. He was effusive in his welcome, and really nice to all of us.  Then he came out and gave my wife and me a squid salad (not on the menu) to try. The squid was smoky and perfectly prepared, both of us were really impressed.  When our meals came out, I was really blown away by the size of my plate. There was some really beautiful sashimi, tuna, salmon and (I think) yellowtail. There was also a really nice tempura shrimp roll, an eel roll, and five pieces of sushi (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, squid, and I can't remember the 5th piece, sorry). I was not expecting any sashimi at all, and only one roll.  I was amazed at how light and flavorful the sashimi was, and how rich the sushi was. The tempura shrimp roll was perfect, and the eel roll was just... jaw dropping. A lovely touch was that they used sprinkles of real gold leaf on the tuna sashimi. My daughters were fascinated, and I will admit it impressed me. He claimed that eating the gold would purify me. No science to that, but it sounded great.  Now, I am certainly not a sushi connoisseur, but I've had really good sushi all over the globe. This was easily in the top five places at which I've ever eaten sushi & sashimi.  The owner came over a couple of times during the meal to check on us, and he chatted with my daughters easily, bringing them to laughter several times. He really, really did a great job of making us feel welcome.  To top the meal off, he brought us a really unique dessert - an Asian pear sherbet in a bed of ground fresh ginger, resting in a shallow pool of pomegranate juice. He said that it would cleanse the mouth and aid in digestion. It was also really amazing. I've never had a dessert like it before, and it was a beautiful end to a fantastic meal.  When the check came, I finally put it together - I had ordered the \"Sushi combo platter ($26),\" but they had brought me (and charged me for) the \"Ara-On Deluxe Platter ($46).\" Normally, I'd have been plenty upset that they brought me a meal almost twice the price of the one I'd ordered, but between the comped squid salad, comped crab rangoon, comped desserts, and personal attention from the owner, I was really not upset about it at all. I choose to believe that it was an honest mistake. Even at nearly twice the price, the Ara-On Deluxe is absolutely worth it. All four of us walked away raving about the place.  I'll definitely be back when I travel here next!",
