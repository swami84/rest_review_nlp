I discovered this place a little over a year ago, and it is hands down my favorite restaurant in New York. The blend of food on the menu is absolutely dynamite. Oysters, clams, shrimp? Perfection. Feeling a lobster slider? They got it. Mussels in white wine with some garlic? YUP. Or my personal favorite, the Kittery burger. It is (and I don\u2019t say this lightly) one of the best burgers I\u2019ve ever had. Thick, plump, and juicy. It looks so good I think Spongebob based the Krabby Patty from Kitterys burger. Order that with a side of Kittery fries (or tots, OR onion rings, yes they have their own style of these) and your taste buds will suddenly find themselves in heaven.  Did I mention how good their drinks are as well? Goodness gracious, don\u2019t get me started. But alas, I will. A wide selection of various drinks from their takes on conventional Mojitos (so sweet, so delicious) to the latest Arnold Palmer twist with bourbon (hint: get with the burger).  Trust me when I say you will NOT go wrong eating here. You are guaranteed to come back, get sucked into their weekly deals (my favorite being their dollar oyster nights) and before you know it you\u2019ll be hosting your wedding here. Do yourself a favor, check it out, bless your taste buds and go home feeling like you\u2019re on cloud 9.",

For appetizers I had fried oysters on half shell delicious.. and artichoke and crab dip equally delicious.. My entree was grilled salmon (seasoned well) with mash potatoes and asparagus.. also check out Addy's \ud83c\udf4b lemonade stand across the street right on the corner. what a little entrepreneur!!...You Rock Addy!!

I love the small bar they have next to the restauraunt where you can purchase ice cream or cocktails, who could beat that.The drinks were just OK, they were strong but lacked flavor. I had a rum punch and I am used to it being a little sweet but it was bitter. My fiance had a pinapple frozen margarita and his also lacked flavor.  I guess if you don't like sweet drinks and just want to get straight to the point with the drink it will be ok for you.  So back to the bar, they have a bench and a few chairs in front of the outside bar where you can sit and have you drink or treat as you wait for your table . I gave this place 4 stars because the wait was horrendous, it was over an hour. It was a good thing we were able to sit at the bar but there were other folks standing and waiting for an extremely long time. Of course due to COVID they have restrictions on the number of people at the bar and restaraunt so I guess safety first.  They however, have plenty of tables outdoor. Some are on the sidewalk, which is fine because it does not seem to be a high traffic area and some are enclosed in a beautiful  gated outdoor area. Once we finally sat down to eat the food more then made up for the wait. We got the fried calamari for appetizers and it was fried to perfection, flavor in every bite yum lol. For entree I got the sea seared scallops and they were juicy, crispy and filled with flavor, it came with string beans and a cauliflower puree that was divine. It was just the right amount of food. My fiance had the seafood stew in a tomato sauce and I kid you not, I almost ate his whole plate as well. He had mussels, scallops and shrimps with toasted garlic bread and it was a party in my mouth, I was very satisfied.  The service was amazing once we sat down, the food came out quite quickly and our waitress was so sweet and efficient, I am sorry I can't remember her name.  They allow you to go inside to use the restroom, in which there are 2 and the place is super clean. They offer hand sanitizer all around and everyone is wearing mask and gloves. All around It was a great experience and we will for sure go back. They just should try to get the wait time down, my stomach was talking to me by the time I ate lol.",

The mussels in white wine sauce were delicious and the extra bread that was provided dipped in the sauce was glorious. We also got the crab cake which was more bready than crabby, which was expected for the price of 13 dollars.

The food took a while too, but normally I can be patient about that as long as I have a drink. My boyfriend got his and I was told mine was on the way.  Half an hour goes by and I FINALLY get it, halfway through my meal. It was very sugary and just not worth the wait. The hostesses were fast at getting us seated and the busboys were on top of clearing our table. The waitstaff just wasn't attentive and it ruined the experience.

The halibut and za'atar tuna were also amazing and the NY Steak was beyond explanation. The service was excellent, the waitstaff very friendly and forthcoming. Definitely one of the best places in New York. Highly recommend it for everything, especially the ambience and the family friendly atmosphere!",

That should have been enough of a red flag, but the weather was perfect and the happy hour drinks are priced right. Decided to jump in on the lobster roll. Clearly frozen bulk purchase. Couldn't finish the roll. It was that unappetizing. Coleslaw was OK. Bulk purchased chips were on the stale side. Overall a great disappointment as this is a lovely outdoor location. Oh another red flag, tape covering tears on the booth seating.",

Right. As time went on we told the bartender to just cancel the order after our patience had run out. She then conveniently went into the kitchen and appeared back with our oysters. She offered them for free... free isn\u2019t the point. We declined. There are way too many great eating spots on Smith to settle for that!

The English muffin was burnt. The croquette was pleasant and not too firm. The side salad had a lovely dressing and plenty of tomatoes.  Clam chowder was nice, not too creamy, with plenty of clam chunks.  Server was inattentive at best, ignored us most of the meal.

Get there before 7 pm and grab an Narragansett bucket of beers and order your clams and oysters.  Northeast oysters so tasty you feel like you're on Cape Cod.  If you closed your eyes you could see the sand dunes and smell the salty air!  This is one of the best fish houses in all of Brooklyn.  The Sheepshead Bay Italian fish houses have nothing on this place.  Oysters, clams and shrimp all a buck a piece with service like you were at a gourmet spot in Manhattan.  Really, this crew does a fine job.  Try the soups there as well.  The fried fish platter was awesome too.  We had friends at two other tables who ordered their meal twice!  Fish restaurants dont last long here.  This is one of the first of its kind that for me will be a staple for visiting guest.  With Jennifer as your hostess you wont be disappointed.  With this warm reception and good food you would be hard pressed to go any place else.",
