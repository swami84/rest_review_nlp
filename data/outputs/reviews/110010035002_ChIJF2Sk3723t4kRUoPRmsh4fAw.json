And the oat milk shake is defiantly my go to treat. The drinks are exotic and tasty also. The fries could use a bit less salt but are still very good especially with the sauces (they all are good). The customer service is always great too. Defiantly one of my favorite spots and would love for it to expand into more Whole Foods.",

I'll definitely come back to this location and recommend to anyone!",

The \u201cchicken\u201d was made out of a mushroom I believe, which doesn\u2019t exactly mimic the texture of meat but it doesn\u2019t make you miss chicken at all because it had so much flavor and was fried perfectly! I also got a side of Bloomies with sweet chili sauce, which was extremely tasty. I picked up a Carrot-Oat-Pineapple cookie as well, which sounded interesting and turned out to be sooo good! The staff was extremely friendly and I will definitely be returning to try out some more menu items. (:",
