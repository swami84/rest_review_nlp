The reviews look good.\u201d I picked it up from the tiny shop outside Waikiki and the smell of bread was delicious. I got my sandwich and ate it at the beach. I got The Machete\u2014turkey, pastrami, ham, salami and cheddar cheese on crack wheat bread. The bread is THICK and fresh. The fillings were also thick. I\u2019m a guy that likes to eat a lot, and for $13.95 this was a deal. I\u2019m so impressed that I will be back and tell all my friends about it. Mahalo.",

I preferred this place over the DT location, despite their never having White bread in the early afternoon (we order from here 2-3 times a week and I have only gotten white bread a single time; heller? Make more white bread if you run out EVERY day! I hate wheat!). I only dislike one lunch meat and meat period and this is ham. Hate ham. Think it is absolutely disgusting. Despise ham and even on Easter make lamb because I hate ham so much. On top of this, the ham was so horribly fat that it kept stopping me from being able to bite into my sandwich. Foul. I dont care that you're out of something, but if I'm paying for a much more expensive meat and you are out of it, do NOT put mother friggin HAM on my sandwich.",
