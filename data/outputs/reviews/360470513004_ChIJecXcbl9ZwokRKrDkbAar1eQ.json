They are a great restaurant in a town full of great restaurants, but what separates them from the rest is their social engagement. They prepare 1,500 hundred meals per week for distribution to underserved communities across New York City! Run by Nate Adler (Huertas), Will Edwards (Marlow Collective) and Flip Biddelman (Flip Biddelman (Huertas)), the result is a gorgeous 70-seat lorimer L train Seat to celebrate the birth and growth of Adler's grandmother in Queens. Here, a small but stylish lunch restaurant restaurant made for 2019. Check out the unchanging mural designed by artist Lea Carey. For brunch, you will find egg'n' cheese on bialys (made in-house by Savannah Turley), on Gertie Breakfast (two sunny eggs, white beans, vegetables and toast) and pumpkin toast. At lunch, the bread rolls include rotisserie meat, provolone cheese, lettuce and Italian seasonings, smoked fish dishes (melted cheddar cheese on white salmon salad and cheddar cheese), and cauliflower melt (spicy cauliflower, Pickled chili and cheese sauce) sesame sourdough). For dinner, you can look forward to more rotisserie and pancakes as well as homemade syrup highball drinks.",

I get that this may have been out of their control but no one from the staff let us know or made any suggestions on making it more comfortable or making up for it, i.e. no hot drinks, blankets etc were offered - even after asking. On top, we were a larger group of +6  and had to do a pre fix menu because of that. I don't mind a pre fix but what they ended up doing was just bringing out 2-3 plates of food in the middle of the table - far less food than what would have been on individual plates. For example we ended up getting 3 cookies and 3 pieces of pie for 9 folks - but had to pay the pre fix price per person - not cool in our opinion.",

Gertie is everything a modern neighborhood regulars spot should be. They have a cute outdoor space, an amazing Cocktail program with smashable staples you could drink every day of the week, an amazingly friendly staff, and the order from an app (or at the counter) combined with the rotisserie means that you can eat as quickly (or slowly) as you like.  The wine list is small but great, and if you ask them, they'll take you down to their cellar and let you look around a small number of off menu options (currently including an amazing organic Grenache from Oregon which goes particularly well with the duck).  Now back to the duck. The flavor is amazing on both the breast and the confit leg, the house made sauces and scallion pancakes are amazing finishing touches. Easily one of the best duck preparations we've had in recent memory. Well worth calling ahead for. The cookies and cream dessert was also off the charts.",

It has a lot of potential but they seemed to still be working out some kinks and the hostess just seemed confused the whole time.  The whole ordering, seating etc system was  very unclear, and we had to stand around for about 5 minutes before someone explained it to us. Given the unconventional system I think they should add some signage about it.  The hostess told us we could wait ~40 minutes for a table or sit at the bar. She assured us there were lots of seats at the bar so we went with that. However when we walked over there were no seats at the bar.... There were a couple at an awkwardly low table (coffee table height) next to the bar though, so we sat there and put in an order at the bar.  10 minutes later hostess comes over and asks if we are comfortable and says a table has opened up and offered we could sit there. However once she realized we had already ordered at the bar she said never mind, we needed to stay by the bar.  Overall I found the whole experience frustrating. We agreed to bar seats thinking we would actually be able to sit at the bar, and then resigned ourselves to the low table because we thought the wait for a real table would be way longer...  Anyway, onto the food. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was quite good. The food took 30+ minutes to come out though which I found surprising considering the menu is so small.  I would go back and try it again now that they have been at it for a weeks. Probably runs more smoothly now.",

It comes with a side of house made potato chips and pickles. If you\u2019re hungry I\u2019d also recommend grabbing a green or grain dish on the side.  We also tried the Chicken Salad Sandwich on Challah. Stuffed with tasty, chicken salad and topped with potato chips, it also comes with chips and pickle. The space is large with plenty of counter seating. A wall of windows makes it one of the brightest restaurants I\u2019ve been to in a while.
