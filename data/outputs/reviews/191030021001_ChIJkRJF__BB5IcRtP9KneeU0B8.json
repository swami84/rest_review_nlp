The maple is my favorite with the Korean BQ being a close second, occasionally the Korean BQ ones are a little too saucy. The Thai curry bao bun is my favorite, so soft and the filling is delightful. I wish it was included in the darling deal with the other bao buns. The fried Korean Chicken dumpling is delicious and is also sadly not on the darling deals list. One of my absolute favorite qualities of this restaurant is the packaging. They use eco-friendly, food-safe cardboard for delivery. I would happily order from them weekly, \"plastic guilt\" free.",

I had a combo with a green curry bun, vegetable tempura, japchae, and lamb dumplings. The curry bun was overpowering. The amounts of curry in there was nasty, and I love thai curry. The vegetable tempura was not tempura. It was sad pieces of cauliflower, dipped in a boatload of batter, and fried. The texture was super greasy and dense, while tempura should be delicate and crunchy. And it was raw in the middle as you can see in the photo. The japchae was so old. It had no veggies at all, and was giant dried out clumps of overcooked noodles. You can see how bad it was in the picture with the huge clump by my fork. The lamb dumplings were one of the weirdest flavors I've put in my mouth, and it was really off putting. My husbands had the fried rice, soup dumplings, and hoisin pork bun. The fried rice was old and dry. The soup dumplings weren't soup dumplings. They had no soup inside at all. We didn't even bother trying the pork bun. We went inside and asked for a refund for the first time in my life. Nothing was edible. The cashier was super nice about it though! I had high hopes for this place with the reviews but was very disappointed. I seriously suggest some quality control in the kitchen, as too much of the food was old.",

The dumplings were overcooked and fell apart as soon as they were picked up, and the fillings were either flavorless or too overwhelming. We split one bun open (green curry) and tried it at the same time. Both of us nearly spat it out. The only thing we could taste was the curry, and there was so much it burned our throats from the one bite.  I'll save going on about this so I don't sound like a brat, but it was bad. I only give this place a 2 star review because the lady working the counter was understanding and gave us a refund after the few bites we tried. Either we had a bad experience, or the 5 star reviewers haven't had good dumplings before.",

There was a huge variety of dumplings so I tried the sampler and although all very flavorful it wasn't what I imagined, there was definitely their own individual touch or flavor to each of them. For example the periogis had the traditional filling but with a potsticker type of wrapper still good but wasn't what I imagined. I didn't know if I like it or not but wanted to give it a fair assessment so went back again before I left town to try some more dishes.  This time I tried something different and got the buns, rice and noodles combo selection they had. The texture of the buns was perfect, honestly wasn't crazy about the filling. I would've went traditional or completely alternative and I think that's might be it. For example traditional periogis with traditional wrap OR try the buns with maine lobster filling. I am giving it a  4 star just due to personal preference, after my second try, I would prefer it more traditional or go wild. Just my own preference.  Also living in a bigger market now I really don't find the prices as high, I think they are priced appropriately. I come back to visit my alma mater quite often and always try some place new when I am in town. This was a nice find and I definetly recommend it.",

That being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend Dumpling Darling for their wide selection of exotic foods.  Located in downtown Iowa City, this cozy establishment has a varied and interesting menu.  We selected an order of the Pork and Cabbage Dumplings, the Potato Pierogies, and the Darling Deal #1 (2 kids of dumpling with 2 sides).  For the Darling Deal #1 I selected the Pork and Cabbage Dumplings, the Korean Chicken dumplings, with a side of vegan Kimchi and Korean BBQ Brussels Sprouts.  The Pork and Cabbage Dumpling are pan steamed, then fried in the same pan (it seemed--I did not observe the preparation).  VERY TASTY dumpling with a good ration of meat and veg, and seasoned well.  The wrapper for them is very thin, which allows more of the flavor of the filling to come through.  The Korean Chicken dumpling looked like it was quickly deep fried (again, I didn't see them getting prepared).  Needless to say, there were delicious.  The outside was thin and crispy, and the chicken inside was moist and flavorful.  And I don't know the sauce it was covered with, but it was amazing.  A perfect compliment to the dumplings.  The vegan kimchi was very good, but I would have liked a little more spice to it.  The Korean BBQ Brussels Sprouts are out of this world.  Dumpling Darling, if you can get my Brussels Sprouts Hating Wife to try two of your amazing side dish, you must know that you are doing something to perfection.  The Potato Pierogies were good, but to us, they were not pierogies.  We come from a town with a huge Polish population, and we've all grown up on our version of piergoies.  All in all, Dumpling Darling did not disappoint us one bit.  We loved the food, and the drinks were amazing as well.  Definitely will come back again.",

In most of my restaurant dumpling experiences, I never feel like it's worth it because at most places, the dumplings taste like they were previously frozen.

Luckily, Dumpling Darling delivers world-class dumplings with inventive (and seasonal!) tastes and a large vegan selection. They have a different daily dumpling special, which I love, because it keeps things interesting! Their dessert dumplings are amazing - not too syrupy sweet, just the right amount, and with neat flavors often mixed in like lavender and chai. The staff are always super friendly, and there are usually places to sit. It's not a huge space, so don't expect to bring a party of 10 for a sit-down dinner, but it's perfect for two people, or a group of four friends.",

I went in about 2 AM, and Chef Leo was there.  Dizzied by all the choices for the late night menu - I decided that I would pull a Netflix move and do something crazy.  I looked at the Chef and I told him,\u201d I want you to make whatever you would want to eat.\u201d He nodded in agreement, and thought for a moment.  I had to clarify, \u201cI want you to make this with passion - I want you to be proud of what you put on that plate. I want you to make a meal that you will wake up tomorrow and you can say to your friends, \u2018I made the BEST meal of my life last night\u2019.\u201d  His eyes wided a bit, and then a devilish grin appeared on his face, \u201cOk.\u201d He said, with a nod.  As the woman working the cashier asked, \u201cWill that be for here or to go?\u201d I saw the wheels started turning in his head, as this Dumpling Darling turned into Chef\u2019s Table. It was like watching a master at work.  \u201cFor here.\u201d I said, as I got the attention of the Chef, \u201cI\u2019m going to sit right here, and i\u2019m going to tell you, to your face, exactly what I think of what you make tonight.\u201d  Well . . .  Remember that scene in Ratatouille, when the critic takes a bite of the food - well it was like that, if he was also in that fighting scene from Endgame.  That\u2019s how much flavor this korean chicken wing had. There were levels. There were conversations with spices. There was heart. This was the Coach Carter of korean chicken wings.  But I said nothing.  See, I was sure that apart of this was a product of the hype. As the Chef looks on, I determine I need to eat another.  I could have sworn I had Hermionie\u2019s time-turner \u2026 because by george of the jungle \u2026. I was back at the start of this incredible epic of a korean chicken wing. In fact - It was even better the second time.  Out of this fever dream of flavors, I looked up and I nodded, \u201cThis is one of the best things that I have ever eaten...\u201d  He gives a NBA finals championship mini celebration to himself - as I dive in for the other four wings of waverly place.  I\u2019ve had food all over the world - and of the top favorites that I have range from, a crab cake from Aruba, a cowboy ribeye from California, Unagi from Sugarfish in NYC, an order of fish and chips from a corner pub in Edinburgh, Scotland, etc. - and now this order of Korean Chicken Wings from Dumpling Darling in Iowa City, IA, by Chef Leo.  He put himself on that plate (it was on one of those bowl boat things, but you get it). I have never been more inspired by food in my life, but it wasn\u2019t about the food. It was about the precision, the passion, and the purpose of this guys life that he decided that - today, he had time. I don\u2019t know if this is his full time job - but Leo is GOING places in his life.  As more people walked in, I kept telling them the story, and people were clamoring for him to make them one.  I get up to leave, and realize I never ask his name, \u201cLeo\u201d, he says.  I give him a point - youu know that point of someone who just did the dang thing, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you Leo.\u201d He gives a nod - and the episode of Top Chef roles the credits.  At the time, I just said order \u2018The Chef Special\u2019 - but having a few days of distance, it\u2019s called the Leo.  Whatever you do today, whatever you think you can\u2019t do today - do yourself a favor, order this, so that you can be reminded there is a \u2018Leo\u2019 in all of us, just waiting to accept the challenge.  Thanks Leo - It won\u2019t be a meal that I will ever forget.",

The Korean fried dumplings had a bit of flavor heat to them, as did the bao but not enough to keep the kids from trying them. The potato pierogies were good, but I personally probably wont order them again.  And the Bibimbap was good but deff had some heat.  They lost 1 star because the soda machine was down and they had no water to give either (they arent allowed to give tap water). We got 2 hot teas and they were alright, but nothing I cant get at hyvee.",

So having a restaurant the serves more Korean food on the menu was a plus for me.  My only suggestion is to make Korean foods without Americanising it. Sorry if I am traditional Korean foodie comsumer, but the Korean restaurants I patronize in MN didn't change the cuisine to fit the tastes of the public. You'll be surprised by people who will enjoy \"authentic\" foods.  Suggestion for the Kimchi fried rice - cut the Kimchi smaller and drain/wring out the juices before pan frying the rice. Add Kimchi juices as needed when cooking. Some Korean mother add in diced Spam into the fried rice. Many did this as Spam was introduced to Korean back during the Korean War.  The baos and mandu was great. I will come back for dumplings again.",

So delicious and flavorful. We will definitely return and tell all of our friends. If you live in the Iowa City area and haven\u2019t been here you are missing out! I will say we didn\u2019t eat in because I wasn\u2019t feeling well so we went for the carry out option, but the inside looks very cute and clean. The staff members were so friendly and kind enough to take the time to write the food labels on all of the boxes for us. What impressed me most was the carry out packaging. We try and live a low-impact lifestyle and try to stay away from packaging that can\u2019t be recycled or composted. Everything was in a brown paper bag in brown boxes! The only plastic was the sauce containers. So glad to have found a business that is taking the time to think about better packaging for the environment. Great job, Dumpling Darling. We will return soon!",

We ordered from here because we were drunk to drive and did not have the wraps to make it at home. So we got it delivered through orderup. I got the Lamb and the Bison(which is apparently supposed to be Nepali style), oh hell no. Its just dry meat with literally nothing in it. We make it with about 15 other ingredients plus the meat.",

The cashier greeted us with a smile and was very friendly. She gave us a run down of our options because we really couldn't decide what we wanted and she was honest and didn't try to sell us on what we were eating. We ordered the lamb steamed dumpling, Korean Chicken dumpling, Perogies and dessert dumplings to get an even sample. The food came out amazingly fresh but much to my dismay very hot (I was hungry and am often impatient, needless to say i burnt my tongue... I deserved that :P ) All the dumplings had a wonderful fresh taste, good flavors and didn't feel too heavy. I don't do well with spicy so I was leery of the Korean Chicken but it had just the right heat that wasn't over powering. Our dessert (it rotates I'm told) was an ice cream filled mochi. It was divine. The prices are a bit high but you get a decent amount. I paid 14 total for two orders of dumplings and a soda. The soda is also incredibly amazing, zero corn syrup (I have a corn food allergy so it's a total win for me!) and they taste amazing. The environment is certainly a bit cramped for my tastes but it's cozy and you can always get your food to go or order frozen dumplings to make later which is awesome.  Food is a language and I have to say I love what they were saying. :)",
