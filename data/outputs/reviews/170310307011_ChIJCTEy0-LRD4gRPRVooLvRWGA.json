The owners are EXTREMELY friendly and the atmosphere they created looks like it will be amazing once we can fully reopen.  The food however! The food was absolutely delicious! Cooked perfectly, then packaged up individually (broth separate from veggies etc) and when we got home and put it all together it was amazing!  I love this little spot and now that live on the other end of the city, I will travel to come get some for sure.  It is one of my Top Five ramen spots at this point!",

Such a cute little spot, very welcoming and right beside the Bryn Mawr CTA Red Line Station.  Let's talk about the real business here: their ramen. Most of their broth are thick pork broth, which tastes fantastic, very balanced. I got the Miso Ramen which has 3 pieces of pork chashu, boiled egg, bean sprouts, green onion and black fungus (that I never tried before on ramen) and it was beyond delicious! My fianc\u00e9 got the spicy miso ramen which was fantastic too. Also, got the takoyaki and seaweed to start it off while we waited for the ramen (that doesn't take that long to come out and being served)  Attention was out of the world. The only waitress, who seems to be the owner, is just pure love. She was very attentive, kind and super friendly. Place is quiet, small and welcoming. That much welcoming that we have been back a couple of times after our first visit. Plus, got some mochi as a gift, DELICIOUS!  A couple of other things to know about this place: Sushi is now being served, they are BYOB and takoyaki is a must",

My wife had the regular spicy tonkatsu which I liked a lot, not too spicy and great flavor to the broth.  The second time we went I had the spicy miso umami ramen which was awesome. The broth was really rich and thick and it had a thicker noodle that I really enjoyed. My wife had the spicy chicken that she enjoyed as well.  We've tried the gyoza and the croquette as appetizers and both were really good and very crispy. The tea was also a nice touch as it was unique, ginger and honey and a citron and honey.
