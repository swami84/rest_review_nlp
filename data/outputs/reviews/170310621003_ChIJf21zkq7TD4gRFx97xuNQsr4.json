We ordered a Variety of items off the menu. But these were my Absolute Favorite...  The Basil Cream Mussels (Available only on weekends though) The Broth, The Seasoning of the Mussels were soo Good!! Especially, served with the Baguette. ~ To Die For!!~  Another Favorite were the Taro Fries Very Unique, Not oily at all & just a perfect Finger Food.

We ordered the Burger, Chicken Fried Rice, and Chicken Katsudon. They were supposed to be re-making everything fresh, but tasted like it was sitting for a long time. Freshness aside, the flavors were also surprisingly bland. We ordered again a month or so later with the gift card and tried the Gen Tso Chicken Sandwich, Orange Chicken, and Garlic Basil Chicken. The General Tso sandwich was outstanding and why I am not rating 1 star. I would ordered that again. The other dishes were again very bland and lacked flavor that didn't get boring after a couple of bites. The delivery driver also didn't have a mask on and we have been very careful with non-masked interactions, so was disappointed to be greeted this way. I could imagine certain items would probably be much better fresh and not delivered, but the overall taste was just lacking for me.",

GREAT FOOD ! i was shopping next door at the snowboard HOUSE Shop... ended up running into BITES because of the sign out front mentioning half off sushi on that sunday. I hopped up at the bar, (it was a lil sticky) but it seemed like a cool spot. Cool natural lighting, and a comfortable feel. I ended up having some of the best sushi ive had in some time ! i got the Wall Street Roll and it was UNREAL it was like salmon, fried bacon skin or somthing on it. FANTASTIC i brought some home and it was even better with some siracha ;) I mentioned to the bartender i had a cold, and wanted some tea. He ended up taking care of me, and whipping up a few different hot teas and had me feeling so much better especailly after some food ! thanks guys !",

Many ramen place give you a ton of noodles with only a small amount is veggies and meat but not at BITES! You get a whole duck wing, an entire bok choy, mushrooms, whole egg and more! So tasty, especially when you have a cold. I told my wonderful waitress May that they I had a cold and asked what she suggested for teas. Too my surprise she made me a off menu special tea....real ginger tea - in the pic you can see the fresh ginger in my hot with whole spices, lemon and a shot of honey.

She was also very helpful in guiding us through the menu as it was our first time there and there were a lot of unique and interesting items there on. As it turned out, positively none of them failed to delight, and we tried stuff from across the menu. I would definitely recommend doing the same, as I feel like just having stuck to one type of food, like sushi or whatever, would have kept us from experiencing all of the other wonderful flavors Bites had to offer!!",

It would be easy to pass by the location, but, make sure that you don't.  The outside is deceiving, inside there are lots of seats in the dining area and the decor is colorful with a tropical flare.  Our waitress was kind enough to explain the menu to us and answered all of our questions with patience and great detail.  The menu is broken down by different sections, but the most important are the small bites, big bites (enough for 2 to share) and the handheld bites.  Other choices are the ramen/bao, sushi, last bites (dessert) and of course many different drinks.  We had one of the lunch specials, Singapore noodles (rice noodles, sliced onion, carrot, yellow curry stir-fry, and your choice of chinese bbq pork or tofu), Philly Maki (fresh salmon, cream cheese and avocado), Soft shell crab sliders, and Bun Roast Duck.  For dessert we had Cookie dough chopstix and Blueberry yuzu cheesecake.  We loved everything that we ate, my favorites were the Soft shell crab sliders, the Singapore noodles and the Blueberry yuzu cheesecake.  The lunch specials are a bargain and the portions are large.  They also include a spring roll and miso soup.  You can order a couple of small bites in order to sample different dishes, split a couple of the large bites, or get a handheld bite for yourself.  No matter what you choose, I recommend several visits here and you will be able to order something different each time you do.  We liked it so much that we are already planning on returning soon.",

The beau and I came for a quick dinner before meeting friends nearby at 8pm on a Thursday.  Not crowded at all, which was both refreshing but also worrying - but helped make the atmosphere a bit more intimate and the service efficient.  We stuck to the happy hour tapas menu: Tuna Tostada, Jumbo Shrimp Shumai, General's Duck Leg, Basil Cream Mussels, Taro Fries, and Garlic Edamame.  Stand outs were the Duck Leg and Taro Fries.  Disappointments were the Garlic Edamame and Mussels - last of which we could not finish due to the awful uriney smell. The waitress was kind enough to take it off our check and confided a lot of customers had issue with the dish due to the fish sauce... but whether that's true or a coverup for using old / bad mussels, I'll never know.  Overall a solid 3 for venue, service, food and deals.",

Everything was absolutely fresh tasting, just enough spice (heat), the sauces were a perfect pairing. Limited on alcohol options, but reasonable (decent pour of red wine for $5/glass). All-in-all, a treat. Even brought home leftovers because we were stuffed. :) Sat on the back patio, which felt homey and comfortable (though we did \"sink\" into the chairs ... maybe they can upgrade those).

My friend and I started with the Crab Rangoon(Made with spring roll paper -unique and beautifully folded and delicious) and Emerald Goyza(The standout here was the sauce- as sweet creme wasabi sauce) - our awesome bartender Pat expertly recommended we dip the crab rangoon into the Goyza sauce. These appetizers were the perfect pair. Then on to RAMEN(the reason for our visit). I got the standard Ramen with pork. It was everything you could want on a chilly evening. Perfect flavoring and beautifully presented. A standout is that they give much more generous portions of all the veggie and meat goodies! Some ramen places have tons of upcharges or they simply go heavy on the noodles. My friend got the Duck Ramen which is unique and delicious - the broth is made from duck fat and it includes a huge leg of duck in the bowl. We didn't plan on dessert... but the head chef Derrick was hanging out at the bar and we told him how much we loved the food and then he just gave us dessert! That was such a nice surprise! The Tres Leches cake was amazing and I'm not a fan of cake in general - see the pics! Come here- you won't be disappointed. Great for small groups or date night.",

We tried some of the buns- i liked the avocado tempura but not the pork belly or the shrimp. Call outs to the crab cakes small plates and the korean sliders, but i thought the ribeye tacos were a bit of a miss- its just ribeye with lettuce. we also tried the duck noodles but i was really full by then and couldnt do them justice. for dessert we got the chocolate lava cake special with vanilla miso ice cream- this was really good. I didnt like the cookie dough chopsticks as much.  the wait staff is good, they seem a little busy but were attentive and helpful. since they were a table of 3 they pointed out which dishes had 2 pieces on them so you can order the third if you like. they also have some deals available, we got 15% off since we presented the menu to them and we also unlocked free garlic edamame when we checked in on yelp.",

We asked some more bread and were charged 3 dollars for it - Pork chop with pomegranate sauce. O MG! Simply amazing! You can't afford not to try this dish!Wasabi noodles with rib-eye. Good. Special taste. Well prepared. Would prefer this dish a bit warmer temperature though. Waitress was also very nice though in the beginning a bit pushy for us to place our order Will come back again.",

The meat to bread ration on both the sliders and buns were definitely in favor of the bread and way too light on the meat.  The sushi was also just meh.  It was also supposed to be happy hour on the tapas, but we were charged full price.",

They sure know how to spin their Asian style into something unexpected like their Asian Churros -- really good & different style of making it - they used those fluffy buns with a side of melted chocolate. I also had their Hot Geisha cocktail -- wow!!! It packed a PUNCH! really spicy and unique...I would love to go back there again!",

The interior has a modern rustic decor and modern comfy seating including two cozy vintage single chairs by the fireplace.  Romantic. ;)  Started off with drinks that used asian flavors such as lemongrass. Small plates were mostly meat except for two and the main menu only had one vegetarian (no seafood) hence the four stars but tasty and a great experience.  We had the pink lotus noodles and mushrooms ramen noodle soup. Taro fries were crunchy with dip.  Lastly, dessert was very interesting and again used unique twist of international desserts with asian flare. We had asian churros (bao bun lightly fried with sweet spices) and best thing ever the coconut creme brulee (perfectly done crunch on exterior and smooth creamy inside with coconut and garnish with mint leaf in a cute ceramic cup.",
