This place is great for dates or a lunch with friends  is very casual but the option is there if you want to dress up for the evening.  Overall a great place out of the way and not  so crowded.

But after already waiting most of the time i had for lunch-- i couldn't afford to wait for them to correct it. Probably wouldn't be so annoying if they didn't also charge DUMBO prices for Jersey quality sushi.
