The dolci was perfectly proportioned but delectably decadent. Pricing was more than fair, and the service attentive. I'd have loved to have seen a couple NY State wines on the menu. But no complaints on anything that is within the control of the management and staff.

When our food arrived we realized why so many people were coming in on a weekday.  Everything was delicious and flavorful! We ordered the farro salad and the calamari for appetizers and seafood risotto and duck for dinner. Loved everything! Even took an order of the short rib pappardelle home for our son. He loved it too and now wants to come back to try the restaurant.  The best part was that the bill was very reasonable! We will definitely be back.",

We were told our table was finishing up and so we waited...and waited...and waited. We watched other parties sit, so we inquired with the hostess, and the hostess admitted her mistake. She promised we would be seated by 8:30pm. If only she has been upfront and honest about how long things were really going to take. We could have walked around or gone elsewhere for a drink. Instead, we continued to wait. We finally sat a little after 9pm in between two other couples. We all ordered from the waitress at the same time. The comedy of errors continued. The tables next to us were paying their check when we were served our meal (a little after 10:00pm). The rigatoni a la norma was delicious, but definitely not worth the hassle. The host offered free drinks and dessert, but at that point, we just wanted to eat and leave. We were offered 50% off our bill. Maybe a weeknight is a better time to dine (when it\u2019s not as busy). I would not eat here again.",

When we paid the bill my daughter noticed that a 20 percent tip after tax was added in.  Hmmmm.  I thought this was usually only added in for parties of 6 or more and that\u2019s what the menu said.  When I had to add the tip on the electronic device I added no tip.  A bus person asked how I liked the restaurant and I said I thought it was terrible.  A young lady who assumed a tone of authority came over and I explained why I would never recommend this restaurant and go ahead and give it a lousy  review.  I don\u2019t like sneaky.   She apologized but I really felt it was not genuine.  They knew exactly what they were doing.  So here is my bad review.  We went to a cocktail bar after that my daughter\u2019s friend manages and told her what happened.  She agreed it\u2019s bs bc it is programmed into the registered in a way I can\u2019t explain when a tip should be included.",

I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner.  The food is INCREDIBLE, the ambiance is beautiful, and the service is personable.  As a vegetarian, there were several and varied items on the menu that met my dietary restrictions.  The meals are perfectly portioned and seasoned - I particularly enjoyed the polenta/mushroom appetizer and the fettuccine pasta.  The meals are clearly home-cooked and carefully created.  We finished up with the tartufo and it was incredible.  I can't wait to go back!  The wait staff clearly enjoy their jobs; they are friendly and personable.  Seems like Piccoli gets many regulars - the waitresses were able to identify their customers by name and check in about their lives.  As we were leaving, the waitress had overheard we were celebrating a birthday and had given us a piece of tiramisu to-go.  It was a sincere and kind touch.  Overall 10/10 experience.  This will be the place we take all of our guests/family/friends when they come in from out of town!",

There are only a couple people working the front of house so on a busy day bare with them. Food is always consistent and if you order the polenta and shrimp make sure to order 2 poached eggs.

The only qualm I have about this place is that it seemed  the owner, or person in charge,  was quite agitated with a particular restaurant worker and vented his frustration in the middle of the restaurant. One would believe, it would be proper etiquette not to discuss conduct of business in front of customers.  Nonetheless, it shouldn't take away from the quality of food and the service provided by the staff.",

I'll start with the positives: my pasta was fantastic and the hostess upon entering was extremely pleasant on a Saturday night. The ambience is also nice. Now, the negatives: we were seated at a table for two inside. It was a busy night. After 15 minutes of no one taking our order for food (we had wine), we were asked if it was okay if we moved outside to accommodate a party of 12 that \"had been waiting outside for 40 minutes\".  We said \"no problem\". We moved outside. 20 minutes later, no order. 10 minutes later, no water. 50 minutes later, we get our food. Still no water or bread. My partner is a chef and there was something off with his crab and pasta dish. He couldn't eat it as he was afraid that he would get sick. While the staff was apologetic, they blamed everything on their new hostess.  The couple next to us also had a horrible experience. Seriously, somebody in this restaurant needs to train their staff properly. Our entire evening  meal was sort of ruined by this. We will never be going to Piccoli again. That is for sure - and it is a shame because this restaurant has so much potential.",

My food was good, but nothing super special, as I expect short rib to be tasty and tender when I pay a chunk of money for it, and a grilled slab of polenta isn\u2019t going to earn any extra rating stars. They nicely substituted veggies on a couple of plates for other veggie dishes that work d better for us. The service was good, it was attentive and friendly but not rushed. They have patio seating so you can have a dog with you, which was nice. The sake mojito was underwhelming\u2014I didn\u2019t get much mojito flavor, and it was more like a watery, iced sake, heavy on the ice. They have a bunch of dessert options, but none really appealed so we skipped it.",

The presentation and taste were excellent - the bacon was super crunchy without being burnt, the French Toast came with just the right amount of maple syrup already on it, and the Heuvos Rancheros were perfect. We also got the unlimited drinks. I had  Bellinis and my friend had Mimosas. The drinks are freshly made and arrive frequently. I can't wait to go back and try dinner.",

        "caption": "I rarely write bad reviews and hate to do it, but we had such a disastrous experience that I feel I have no choice. Also, Let me preface this by saying it has taken me forever to write this review, so hopefully things have changed since our experience... OK so we went out for a date night, we were hoping for a nice and relaxing night. Well it absolutely did not turn out that way. First of all we asked to some of the staff if we can sat outside and he said that they had a reservation, which was ok because we did not have reservation. We ate and we left and no one was on the table. After that Marta or something like that approached us to take us the order (i think she was  our server, at this point I don't know who was)   that was the first time that we saw her in our table  and the second was when she gave us the bill, these was only two times that we saw her., we saw her the whole moment showing photos of her new baby but never doing her job.  Anyway , We ordered an amazing salad and pasta, the food was more than good. Also we ordered a rose wine which tasted old and a perroni.  Then, the food came on time but when we wanted to order more drinks there was no one to order,  so ok it happens. but then we tried to order a dessert we really love tiramisu but again there were no one to take the order, until the buss boy came, he was the person who said to some one of the server staff that we wanted a dessert. Then the tiramisu came and was totally beautiful although we waited for spoons around 15minutes and we just got the spoons because we remind to the person who gave us the dessert that we need it. While we were eating our dessert we cleaned the rest of the utensils and we put it on the table next to us, then three persons came in so the same server that gave us the tiramisu and forgot the spoons for 15 min, he gave those people  the table next to us but some  that was very rude from his part was telling us if we can clean our dirty utensils, he  even did't ask  if we need it or something coordial, he just said \"these are your things? can you move it please?\" so i was very very disappointed. I am going to be very clear about why we are very disappointed , While we were eating there were two more persons who we don't know if were servers or something but they just forgot our table, they weren't busy because was around 3:30pm on Sunday, there was just 4 tables and 4 people of the staff, they were just hanging and showing baby pictures, when we asked for utensils, water, drinks and dessert they were very very rude, with attitude  and unprofessional.Completely unacceptable. At the end we just gave tip  to the busboy who was the only person that was nice and professional. Honestly seems like this place needs someone that knows customer service and how to run a restaurant. We been here before a couple of times because we live in Park slope, definitely we are not coming back, we thought order delivery because we love the food but we don't know yet. Park slope has  a very good italian places piccoli used to be one of them, but unfortunately it is no anymore.",

If I had to recommend something on the menu, it would be the spicy squid ink pasta with shrimp and chorizo. It's my favorite and usually is what I get. In addition, the prices are super reasonable for the area, with pasta dishes running you in the teens. Finally, the place is amazing, it's a tiny little hole in the wall, and a real find!",

Four of us tried Piccoli Trattoria and it was everything we hoped it would be.  I usually like to offer a little bit of criticism in my positive reviews if only so as not to sound like a ringer or the owner's brother.  But I really can't in this case. Everything was terrific: the food, the wine selection, the service, the unpretentious bistro decor.  After reading a few of the reviews here I was expecting at least an overwhelmed dining room staff with it being Saturday night and all but they knocked it out of the park there too,  If anything, the service was a tad over-attentive... and there it is, my requisite little piece of grousing.  The pastas were fresh and original and the meats were terrific and substantially sized. The sides were large and very tasty (I loved the grilled brussels sprouts and calamari salad).  The desserts were scrumptious. You will not walk out of this place hungry, which is more than can be said about a lot of the new restaurants hitting this neighborhood.  We will be back, and soon.",

Good Italian restaurants are usually owned and operated by a huband and wife. And it was absolutely true to this restaurant with real authentic Italian food. It was a real deal.  I especially enjoyed the seafood black squid pasta and grilled calamari . Please try them when you go there for the first time. They served Mahattan quality food with Broooklyn price.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Their salads and appetizers are also notable.  Personally, I really enjoy their brussel sprout salad.  Have eaten many risotto dishes here, all of which I highly enjoyed.  The service is always great and everyone has a friendly disposition.  I always leave here feeling good.  Seating is very limited so call ahead.",
