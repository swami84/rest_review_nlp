It's the house for the sandwich and it's just as important as what's in it.  I'm sure this place is hurting with no lunch crowd during COVID, so try to help them out.  Nice people and great sandwiches.  Wish they'd offered drinks as well to pre-order on the website.",

Coffee is okay and the sandwich was egh. The sandwich Included egg and was unexpectedly cold but maybe that's the purpose? Not sure. Ambiance reminded me more of Panera vice being a cozy place to do work or enjoy coffee. I may come back and try again, later",
