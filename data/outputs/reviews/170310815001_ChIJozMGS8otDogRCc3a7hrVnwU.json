To start off, us and a older couple were rudely told to keep backing up and to go back outside after we were just let in. Once we were seated we had no silverware and ended up having to find my own from another table because no one ever brought us any. My friend ordered a burger and got a 3oz patty on his bun. Literally looked like a McDonald\u2019s $1 burger size. He also ordered a side of cinnamon sweet tots and got plain sweet potato tots. I got they same one burger and requested Paul\u2019s sauce and avocado spread on side got neither. I asked for an order of fries didn\u2019t come so had to ask another waitress for them came after I was already done and almost ready to go. The waitresses overall were short and kind of had an attitude we felt like as if we kept inconveniencing them because they didn\u2019t bring all our food correctly the first time. We had a total of 3 different servers throughout the meal which is extremely unorganized and frustrating. This was our 3rd time trying to get in and finally decided to wait the hour out as we had so much anticipation to try your restaurant. We have always bought your burgers from out local grocery stores and could not wait to eat here. I cannot tell you how let down we were from the experience.",

Cause the first table by the door right near the windows is so cold when the ac is on blast I had to ask them to open it cause I was cold \ud83e\udd76 but i really loved it I have been dying to come here since it opened. And the cute little napkin holders have a picture of mark and...I believe his family so it ALMOST feels like he is sitting with u. Which is amazing lol The fries were not to die for but maybe I\u2019ll change my mind next time I come. He also have like a vegetarian specific menu which I thought was adorable and u can also drink there. There is a parking garage right by there also \ud83d\ude97 I think I was there like 40 mins and it charges me $36 dollars almost as much as I paid to dine there haha with my brother. So if u can find cheaper parking near by definitely go there.  Edit: came back today feb 28th, 2020 I got the whisky breeze \ud83e\udd43 is alright \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Food runner said mine should be out next. Quite some time passed (with other tables sat after us receiving burgers) and I had to ask the bartender about my burger. He said they are making it. Again more orders that were taken after me continued to be brought out. My wife completely finished her burger and I was still waiting. Bartender seemed like he wasn't concerned, so I had to ask for a manager. He finally came out and said they will put my order in and offered me another beer while I wait. I could not believe they still had not even put it in! The place had open tables and wasn't busy for a downtown restaurant. We were not going to stay any longer, there were plenty of chances (food runner communicating mine wasn't served, idle bartender) for them to get it right. The manager gave me his card and said he would like to make it up.  The couple next to us at the bar saw what was happening and told us they complained to the bartender about their meal as well. And a man sitting by himself behind us at the window heard us talking and also said he had a problem with his burger and brought it back to the counter to get it right.",

The waiter also was supposed to bring me a refill but then let it sit out on a table while he took another groups order, even though he was supposed to be helping us first.  We were expecting to have a good time and have a great dinner, and we had a subpar experience, the burgers came out cold and I personally wanted medium rare and got medium. This was a terrible experience in all for the family, and was not worth the time. Please fix the service and the food.",

        "caption": "The staff is friendly and helpful. The menu however is a bit mis-leading however specifically when it comes to \"The Our Burger\" compared with \"The Double Decker\" and then \"The Triple Decker\". The Our Burger is a third of a pound (5.7777 oz), The Double Decker with paddies are 3 oz. a quarter of a pound is 4 oz. So for the price not a good deal  as a consumer you paying a dollar more at the location for less then an ounce of more meat (.3333 oz). The better value for the consumer would be The Triple Decker which also has 3 oz paddies comes in a Half a pound plus an ounce (9 oz.) and is only 2 dollars above the cost of The Our Burger so you get a considerably better value from The Triple Decker when compared to The Double Decker.  The reason for the questionable menu listing weights in different measures is simple, they know that most people will go for the double before the triple because people will think that they are getting the equivialent to third quarters of a pound with the triple when in fact they are only getting a little over half a pound. This is because people may not know how many ounces are in a pound or how many ounces are in a third of a pound, and most people may not do the math if they do becausse a triple just sounds big. In any case I would suggest not getting the double, the value for the bang is not there.  That being said, the burgers are tasty, and the fries could use a bit of improvement, but also are passable.  They offer both service at the counter for orders to go and booth service via wait staff. I may go here again, but I will never get \"The Double Decker\" again.",

Wow, I was surely disappointed. We went in on a Saturday at noon. I was expecting it to be pretty busy as it was lunchtime on a weekend in downtown Chicago. To my surprise, it was not that busy.  We came in with a party of five and were promptly seated. After a fair amount of delay the server took our drink order and in a normal amount of time, the drinks arrived. She then took our food order. As they were preparing our food we waited and talked and talked and waited and then did that some more. And finally after looking at my watch two of us had to leave due to a meeting we had to attend. They left without food.  We continued to wait longer and our food finally came out. Unfortunately, not only were several of the orders incorrect, but several items (onion rings and fries) were absent. My burger was ordered with no onion and extra lettuce, add jalape\u00f1os. They got one of these correct. Another order had some items missing from it as well.  This is a highly known and advertised, top-end, chain restaurant. The place wasn't busy and yet not only did we wait an inordinate amount of time to get our food, but orders were incorrect and items missing. This is not good customer service. Not even close. I was severely disappointed. The food was cold by the time I was able to actually eat it.  I won't be coming back.",

The bun was small and the burger was even smaller! Can't you at least make the burger the same size as the bun?  The service was ok - not great - just ok. Would not recommend and definitely will not be back. Mark and Danny you need to stick to acting!!  Thank you for your response - at least it shows that you really do care. I have shared our experience with you and find no reason to have a further conversation. Your burgers - especially your \"Pauly Favorite\" should at least be the same size as the bun.  That is not something you should have to be told.",

The table we were sat at had air from the vent blowing directly over the table and it felt as if we were eating outside in the Windy City. We asked to move to another table and the waiter seemed to know it was an ongoing issue. It took him awhile to get our drink orders and once he did we felt as if he was rushing us. Like we were holding him up. It surely wasn't busy in there. He hardly checked on us and when he did he would pass by us and ask if we were ok. As if it was too much for him to spare a minute at our table. I had a birthday frappe and I assumed he was going take the one we ordered off of the bill but he ordered a different one and didn't ask us what flavor we wanted. I don't even know what we got but he ordered it for there even though we were clearly about to pay. We had to tell him to give us a cup to go and he was blaming the bartender for how long it took. Lastly I went to the restroom,  it was dirty and none of the stalls had toilet paper. Overall it was a horrible experience and the only thing I would go back for is the food. I'm sure the Wahlberg family didn't want to be represented this way but hopefully they will see this issue going on at their store and fix it.",

I had the double with cheese an it was really good could of eat another an had some of my spouse sweet potato totts they are really good. The only thing i didnt like i got fries an they were not crispy like it has said on the menu . It was so disappointed . They were soft . Would of gave it 5 stars but the fries were not what they said to be. Spouse had the impossible burger she said it was really good. I hope next time i stop in for lunch or dinner it will be a better experience there. Overall the place was a little  dirty windows were not clean at all. I would of expected the place to be really clean becouse of the ownership of the business. Other then that it was a great time there. Would go back to eat there again once i get the time again to do so.",

I didn't start timing until I was seated for a few minutes.  I put menus at end of table after deciding what to get, kept my head up trying to engage  anyone. It wasn't empty but definitely not busy and I was seated nearly in the center of the restaurant - couldn't really overlook that I was there. .you would think.  Servers and bussers passed the table but not a glance, no water, no\"someone will be right over\", no are u ready to order.... just ignored.  As I left I told the 3 employees gathered at the host stand,  that after being ignored for ten minutes i was leaving.  The lady who sat me, asked where I was sitting, to which i pointed.  The 3 just looked at each other.   Not sure if this is usual but not even an apology was uttered; no attempt to get me to stay by taking my order.  Now I happen to work in hospitality, I am a concierge at a nearby hotel and this is a complete failure at initial service and recovery.  I wouldn't give this place long. There are too many places providing great food and service why bother.  I won't nor will I direct any of the 100s of guests who approach my desk daily looking for places to eat.",

Aside from the fact that it took us 10 minutes for a server to bring us waters and then our burgers took another 20 minutes to come out, I'm pretty sure the only salt in the building is on the table because even the fries weren't seasoned. I'm also pretty sure this place has a stake in a jalape\u00f1o farm because they put enough on each dish to make a Mexican restaurant jealous. Food is overpriced and you have about 40 better options in a two block radius, including McDonald's.",

There was no enjoyment in these burgers. Quite honestly, going to McDonald's would have been better than this. Another terrible area of this place is the sides and drinks. The sides were much too small for their price. This was especially seen with the fried onions. Too thin and tasteless for anyone to consume. The drinks were watered down and horrible. The lemonade tasted like lemons and water. That's it. The other drinks were watered down as well. The only drinks that were not watered down were the sodas. The only good thing about this place was the restrooms, which was the only clean part.",
