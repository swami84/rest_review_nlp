The blackened roasted one was a little overcooked, and was missing the crispiness you get right when it's out of the oven.  The ones with the batter on the outside were fairly crispy, but I guess if they wanna preserve the crispiness on the roasted ones, they need to store it in a different style of heating container that keeps it dry.  The steamed broccoli was pretty good but not amazing, maybe could have used a more pronounced sauce, but I guess they gotta have a healthy light option for some ppl.  All vegan! :D",

Yesterday (Sunday) I went to get us a lunch, we attempting to try all of the sandwiches because we\u2019ve tried the entire menu otherwise. I ordered two sandwiches (both with extra cheese sauce on the side) and an order of pakora in person at the window. A total of 6 people got their food before I did and I realize they make the sandwiches to order but my total wait time was nearly 30 minutes. During which time they\u2019d already packed the order of pakora. Before I left I asked if the extra cheese was in the bag, the young lady at the counter went to ensure I had them and was told they were in the bag. When I got home (I live around the corner 400ft to be exact) the pakora and rice were cold and sodden. And of course no cheese sauce, not extra, not any. I was so disappointed and disheartened by the wait I didn\u2019t bother to go back but I sincerely wanted to because I was so upset. The food is worth it but I\u2019d recommend going on a weekday.",

Set a pick-up time for 5:45pm (instead of the default for 5:30pm that was suggested on the website). Got the text my order was ready at 5:30pm anyway. Food was super cold, and soggy, and really lacked flavor. The best part of the meal were the fries I added on to the \u201cBrocc Pocket\u201d. There was no option to modify an order even though on the website it said to add a sellers note upon checkout. Super dissatisfied and sad. Even the workers inside were lackluster and when I mentioned how excited I was to pick up my food to try it they didn\u2019t even respond lol.  Hard pass!  *UPDATE*  I went back (thanks to the response and action of the co-owner). The food was hot and the \u201cpo boy\u201d style sandwich was incredible. The staff was kind. Thank you!",
