The pizza tasted phenomenal, we had the Pesto Burrata pizza and the Meat Lover\u2019s pizza and both were delicious. Each pizza had very generous amounts of toppings. The pizzas were large in the sense that one would be enough for two people to share and be satisfied, but also if you\u2019re really hungry you might be able to eat an entire one on your own. The atmosphere was wonderful, being able to sit and see the wood fire stove from our table really set the ambiance. I also love that they served all their drinks in jars adding to the aesthetic. All the employees there were also very friendly and our server was wonderful and very kind. If you\u2019re ever craving really good pizza I would definitely recommend coming here.",

The service was below average and slow for a not busy restaurant.  The server walked past my empty water glass placed out on the empty table to my side 4 times before I asked for a refill.  She then refilled it with slightly cooled water with no ice.  The prices we were charged for the pizza was different then then menu, about $1.50 more per pizza. EDIT: I didn't take a picture of the bill, so I don't know if what you are saying is correct or not.  My recollection is that the pizza was ~$12.50 in the menu but showed as ~$14.00 on the bill.  On the bill, below the line for the pizza was a separate line for tax.  It's possible that there was not an additional line for tax, but that would mean that you have the only receipt I've ever seen that adds tax to each individual menu item.",

The restaurant serves wood-fired personal pizzas with a good mix of the classics (Pepperoni and Sausage) and more unique (the Fig & Pig pizza we had was a white pizza with fig jam, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, and shaved parmesan and was incredible!). They also have great salads and a wide selection of beverages. The restaurant has a cool, modern vibe with plenty of local art. Finally, all of the food is very reasonably priced; dinner for two with alcoholic drinks will end up being around $40.",

They make their own bread in house and it\u2019s toasted in the brick oven. This gave the bread a nice chew without being overly hard. The pizzas are personal size so we ordered the margherita and Italian beef with hot giardiniera. The crust was amazing, crispy, and didn\u2019t get soggy. The Italian beef was excellent and the giardiniera was hot but not overpowering. The margherita pizza has just the right amount of basil and the sauce was very flavorful.

Not this place. I\u2019m really impressed. First off limited menu, I\u2019m talking like 6, maybe 9 different pizza, which I proudly have tried all of them. Every pizza is personal, as in 10-12 inches, and is plenty. I\u2019m pretty traditional as far as pizza toppings, but my favorite was the prosciutto and fig. They use a brick oven, so pizzas are done quickly. They do not serve beer yet, but speaking with the owner, their plan is to serve local brews only. My new favorite spot by far.",
