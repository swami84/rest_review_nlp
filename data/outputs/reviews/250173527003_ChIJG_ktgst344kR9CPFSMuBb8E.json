They were extremely nice, and even went so far as to notice that my mobile order didn't match what I said on the phone (I called ahead to ask a question)...so they waited until I got there, clarified, and rushed my order out quickly!  One of the rare times that I feel like Cambridge prices are justified...the food is delicious, quantites are HUGE, and the atmosphere is great.  Will recommend to anyone.",

They also gave us chips plus some dips and the chipotle crema sauce was fantastic! Portions were decent, and I was able to pack my meal to eat later as well. Would definitely return.",

We went back for take out this weekend, were again impressed with the friendliness and concluded it was \"the best take out\" we've had during quarantine thus far (we've noted that a lot of our favorite dishes from other restaurants don't seem to manage well as take out.) I had the Mero Mero burrito; it was flavorful, a little spicy, and HUGE. My husband had the beef torta and said it had all his favorite things on it \"just right.\" We (obviously) ordered the queso and chips and ended up diving into our personal stash of chips to finish (so much). Next time will order a second bag of chips to go. (Yeah. No moderation here.)",
