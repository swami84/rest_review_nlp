        "caption": "Blue Corn is very good & consistent. We've been ordering here for several years, and everything's always been good with no major hiccups. For a long time It used to be called La Oaxace\u00f1a for most of those years, which was about the same as I can tell. I think they rebranded, the food hasn't changed much (a good thing). Food is fresh and tasty- go tos for me are tacos, enchilada platters (mol\u00e9), rice & beans, tortas, fried thin meat milanesa / veg platter items...some reviewer below said the tacos are weaK- I disagree. Had them all. Make sure to get then fully loaded, con todo. For NYC it's top notch value compared to more hipster places dtown and brooklyn. Queens is comparable. Comes with the meat, lettuce, herbs, tomato, cheese, onion, with the double tortilla- these tacos are substantial. 4 tacos and a small rice and beans Is a solid meal and good value. I'm not a small guy. Meals come with a good spicy tomatillo sauce. Also pre covid I've eaten there inside several times. It's clean and chill. staff is nice. Takeout always packaged neatly. A good local neighborhood establishment to support, owned and operated by ppl who care a lot more than average.",
