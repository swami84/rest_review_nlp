I'm sorry if I can see spaces clear as day and have it seasoned with a sprinkle of seasoning I would have ordered a regular. Never in my life have I ever paid so much for potatoes for the portion I got. The second reason I'll never come back is the order request. Theres no extra charge to get your chicken coated reasonable but if I ask for heavily coated just to ensure its covered this is unacceptable. I ordered 2lbs and it's already expensive but only 2/3 of that chicken was coated. I'm outraged! $60 dollars straight into the trash due to poor quality.",

I don\u2019t want to be another mindless bird in the flock and resort to offensive language, or Reductio ad Hitlerum in describing this establishment; although I would say that it was a little Wernher Von Braunish. But not Wernher Von Braun himself, more like a little brother with a considerable lower IQ and none of the accomplishment. (Cheesy Dis Time)  Me: \u201cThis Chicken was DRY!\u201d Crowd: \u201cHow dry was it?\u201d Me: \u201cIt was as DRY as Menopause\u201d Crowd: \u201cOooooooooooo!\u201d The chicken I ate was so dry and dead, Logan Paul himself came out of the bushes to film me eating it. As someone who is a trained cook, I know there are plenty of ways to cook chicken without killing all of its moisture, and apparently Wings do not know the simplest among these. Now, Here\u2019s me be nice guy\u2026 :) Let Me help out all the Patrons to this sad establishment out with a little LifeHack on how to enjoy Wings Over Lowell at home. Step 1: Pull out the Frozen BBQ chicken that has been sitting in your freezer for the past 2 Years. Step2: Cook Chicken immediately 50 degrees higher than what is suggested on the package. Step 3: Take out of oven 5-10 mins late. Congratulations! If you did this correctly, you now can enjoy the horribly dry Wings Over Lowell Chicken in the comfort of your home, and you don't have to waste $10\u2026 Yes, $10s on that GARBAGE lol\u2026 -Cheers! #bluehanky137",

Service is slow most of the time, so if you're starving go somewhere else. I think it's good to try a place a couple of times before reviewing, and every time I went back the food started to grow on me (the service still sucks though...). I've also ordered their wings via delivery for a party once and didn't have any complaints from them. It did take a while for the order to get to us though, considering the house was about 15 minutes from the place and it took them an entire hour and a half. Overall, it's decent and I'd recommend anyone to try this place at least once. Oh, but don't go late at night or after a game, it's packed.  Tip from my friend: Don't order their salads.",

And the cheese sauce was a rip-off for the amount extra you pay, but it was good.  My fries were very bland, though, even with ketchup.  There wasn't any salt, etc. on them... Also, if it counts for anything, the people next to us seemed to be enjoying their wings.  I wouldn't personally go here again, but it doesn't seem like too bad of a place.",
