        "caption": "Edit: I changed my review from 4 stars to 1 stars because I can tell two of the recent reviews are FAKE.  I almost put 4 stars, I really almost did. But in the end of my experience I realized 3 is deserved.  First off, I live in the Flatbush neighborhood, only 2 blocks from this place. So seeing it opening got me excited, actually. It's definitely a small owned local business too, so I want to see it succeed.  The place is clean and service was quick, but let's be honest, thats not what is most important.  First off, The MENU They are a cajun fried food/bento restaraunt. The menu is small (which is good), but the fried shrimp/fish/chicken boxes are only served with regular fries/cajun fries. I got the fried shrimp box with regular fries and it was okay. Seasoning was decent, but the shrimp were slightly overcooked. I also felt that I was missing something - I wish it came with a buscuit/cornbread/hushpuppy/roll/ect; something to break up the rest of the food which was rather...greasy... (I also wish they had cocktail sauce, they don't somehow..?)  Now as for the price, it was decently priced at $13 for the fried shrimp box (comes with 8 shrimp) and competitive in relation to similar restaraunts in the neighborhood.  All in all, my food was half okay, I just think the owners should add some sort of bread/ect; to the fried seafood boxes, it's very common and expected.  Should you go? Of course. It's a new local restaraunt and they deserve your support, they're just getting their bearings during this difficult time for the hospitality industry.",

        "caption": "Oh, Actually, I like this restaurant so much! Especially the seafood here reminds me of my days in Orlando. I used to go to a chain of seafood restaurants in Florida, but now that I've moved to Brooklyn. This new seafood restaurant meets all my requirements. The taste of seasoning is very unique. I like Gallic butter seasoning and house special. I ordered the shrimp many times, and every time it was as good as ever. Shrimp and Tilapia baskets also tastes well! I could add shrimp to the basket, and it is cheap. I can also only order shrimp without fries. The manager here is nice and can meet all my needs.",
