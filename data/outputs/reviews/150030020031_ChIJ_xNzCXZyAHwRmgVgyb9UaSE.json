For ~$15 a bowl, it was nothing fantastic, and I wouldn't recommend driving out of my way to come here. The only thing I felt was that was going for them is their spacious restaurant which is good for big groups, and the portion size of the ramen bowls were huge.

They never came back to check on how we were doing, didn't pre bus our table, not even come back to pick up our check, so we had to go to host station to pay.

Even so, it took a while for them, each time we needed something.  We started out with the Chicken Tatsutaage as an appetizer. It comes with a dipping sauce on the side but the seasoning on the chicken is already salty/flavorful enough. I liked that it was bitesize, like popcorn chicken, so it was a lot easier to eat.  For my main, I had the garlic tan tan ramen, which I believe was one of their seasonal specials. It comes with char siu, some veggies, and a bed of garlic resting on top of a sheet of seaweed. It wasn't bad but I think the garlic really made it. If it was plain, it wouldn't have been anything special.  Probably wouldn't come back. I'm sure there are tons of other ramen spots in Hawaii, and I'd like to try those first.",

I was able to grab dinner (again) from here at 9:30pm and was fulfilled. Must try and prices are very reasonable $9-15USD.

The broth was very tasty (she got the non-spicy) and the noodles were cooked just right (not too soft). We definitely enjoyed it here. Just remember that they charge the gratuity on the bill. Not my preference since it kind of pushes the labour cost to the customer; however, the prices are reasonable for the location in Waikiki beach.",

Since the waitress desperately tried to convince us to try their new truffle ramen ($20), we ordered one and it does taste better but the noodle came at a much smaller portion!  At first my kids refused to try the new truffle ramen , the waitress came back and asked them \u201cWhy not?\u201d,\u201d is it the higher price?\u201d,etc. I guess this is the Asian way to do market research but to Americans like my kids it was a very rude manner .

The soup was tasteless and the ramen was not chewy.  The funny thing was to have Chinese Choy Sum as a part of it.
