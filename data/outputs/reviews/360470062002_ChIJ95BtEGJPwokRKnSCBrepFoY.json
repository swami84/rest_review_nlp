Our waiter was Natalie but we also met Rordy and Christian. They were all excellent! She was attentive to us, friendly and  made sure we were good.  To start they offer warm bread and a delicious dip I believe eggplant dip.which is amazing! For dinner we had the calamari and also chicken cutlet parmesan with potatoes and veggies. Our meal was delicious!  The ambiance was great with music playing and.outdoor seating. We will definitely be returning!",

And wow. we stopped in for a drink and maybe an appetizer, we ended up trying 5 menu items and bringing home a pappardelle Bolognese. The scallops (on special) were amazing, the warm octopus cooked perfectly, Fried artichokes had just enough crispy breading inside and just enough warm cheese in the middle. Oysters, martinis, pear salad - great.  Now, on to the service. Gennaro was professional, jovial and honestly one of the more attentive yet not overly pressured servers I have had in a long time. He plated a serving from each of the specials, had good timing for table stops - real basic blocking and tackling that is easily overlooked but REALLY noticable when it's done right.  Not usually one for rave reviews but we'll be back to Baci. Frequently. Looking forward to it.",

However, Baci Ristorante quickly dispelled that skepticism. From the moment we entered and were cheerfully greeted by Natalie, my eyes feasted on the decor; it's modern, with radiant colors, but also infused with a Sicilian touch, you can feel the quality and creativity that went into it.  As we were seated, I noticed a bottle of wine at every table accompanied by lightly toasted bread and Caponatina (a traditional Sicilian appetizer).  Sal, the owner, brought out an antipasto that awakened my Italian palate. OMG! It consisted of two shrimps bowing to each other (a symbol of a couple), finely chopped almonds marinated in a party of flavors with an avocado cradling a crabmeat cocktail which was perfectly balanced with a balsamic reduction.  My main course was the Dover Sole, which Sal personally filleted for me right at our table. The fish was very fresh.  My husbands entree had an interesting twist: Gnocchi Alla Genovese; which consisted of gnocchi over a bed of San Marzano marinara sauce, then topped with a layer of pesto sauce capped with a creamy buratta in the center.  For dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was pure perfection with an anniversary candle in the center, Sal also brought out a dish of warm Sicilian fig cookies, he, along with Mattia (one of the waiters), and the entire staff wished us a happy anniversary.  If you're looking for a clean, quality, healthy and delicious meal that leaves your stomach yearning for more... even after you're full... go to Baci!",

Brownie dessert was not home made and didn\u2019t even taste like chocolate.looked pre packaged, very firm.No light beer available. Lots of other places in Brooklyn with great food and atmosphere!! Not worth it at all! Staff was friendly but very eager to take plates away.",

We only eat quality food. The service and the waitress Natalie was outstanding. You get the full service from head to toe. Always there for us. And most of all 125% clean, when I walk into the men's room of a restaurant and find it super clean that explains the entire restaurant is clean. That is my test when I eat out. The men's room is spotless. Baci restaurant well done. I give you 5 top stars. Cozy, Romantic, comfort, and the perfect place to get wined and dined.  Robert from Bensonhurst Brooklyn.",

I had read all the reviews before coming in and I was a little worried but I like to decide for myself and I'm glad I did. The owner was really funny and very committed to his craft. I love the spirit of an entrepreneur who leaves his home in Italy to start over and make something great. These are the every day heros.  Shout out to Genaro for attention and care.  We had a great experience. The food was fresh and well prepared. We had recently returned from vacation in Italy and my niece said the food at Baci was just as good as in Italy.  Grilled octopus and burrata cheese to start were yummy. Great cocktails. We had branzino and a few pasta choices. The pesto was Divine. The desserts we're good. I'm not a dessert person so I'm not the best judge.  Take a chance. We did and we're not related or friends with the owner. We love you despite the fact that you're Sicilian.

Have no fear it was little bit crazy but it\u2019s New York !! As busy as it was and was busy the service from the bar to the table  was superb . Not to mention the food was a 5 star  excellent . We had the  grilled octopus fried calamari to start, then the  sausage broccoli Rab pasta  and  salmon . All food came out at great temperatures.  Kudos to the owner you have a great staff and the place is beautiful .. I\u2019m excited to come back with friends.. FYI love the lemon trees outside very classy \ud83d\udc4d. Good luck \ud83c\udf40",

From the delicious Italian styled egg roll, to the melt in your mouth surf and turf, and then the finale of delicous creme brulee and bread pudding. This place is definitely going to be a new go to restaurant and if you're ever in the area don't miss the opportunity to stop here! All the staff was so welcoming and friendly and makes you feel at home.",

We started off with Octopus Baci, fried artichokes and the Baci salad. Then we moved on to pasta Anelletti al Forno which is a traditional Sicilian dish of ring shaped pasta in a meat and pea sauce baked with mozzarella. Absolutely delicious. For a main we shared the veal chop valdostano which was very large and perfect for sharing. It was a butterflies and pounded veal chop with prosciutto, fontina cheese in a mushroom Marsala sauce infused with black truffle and topped with wilted spinach.  That was equally delicious.  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was one of the best I have ever had.  An excellent experience.  I will be going back this week to try some other items on the menu.",
