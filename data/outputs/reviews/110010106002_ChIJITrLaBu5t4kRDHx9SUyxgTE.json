I ordered through Uber eats and someone working today must not know how to use their side of the app.  They never notified me via app when the order was ready until AFTER I had my boyfriend just show up to see if it was ready. I\u2019ve never had to wait more than 15 min so was strange they never sent a status update even after 25min.  They also made him pay in cash even though I already paid in Uber eats. When he got back, he said they only charged for the two bowls of pho even though my order asked for pho AND an appetizer. He only paid for what we got, which is fine, but I made note to refute my order on the app later.  After eating, I opened my app to see that they never closed my order - so I had to cancel, get charged for cancelling and then notify Uber Eats for a refund request.  I have no idea what the restaurant did or didn\u2019t do, and yes, we got our food eventually. However, they definitely need to train their staff how to use the app or just not make it available at all. Would advise to call for pick up instead of ordering through the app.  FOOD WISE: satisfactory but pretty oily broth.",

We also ordered an appetizer that never came out. I had to ask about it and didn\u2019t even eat it because we were already done and it didn\u2019t taste fresh at all. Went to pay for our order and was verbally told that I wouldn\u2019t have to pay for the appetizer, but was then charged for everything. I had to look at a menu and question it after the fact. The manager came out and argued with the staff in front of me. Then, I was was told that next time if I don\u2019t like something I need to tell a waiter instead of waiting?!? She picked up the ringing phone and after she was done I had to remind her that our orders were completely wrong and we were told we didn\u2019t have to pay for the appetizer.

There were other patrons who were seated and two parties came in after me.  I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls, chicken pho, and asked for water. The spring rolls and water never came. The pho was brought out within 5 minutes. The portion appeared very slight compared to other places I\u2019ve had pho.  I looked at the other patrons\u2019 orders as they came out. Each table was offered and received water. As well, several ordered spring rolls and received them.  The waitress attended to the other tables but never returned to my table to ask me if I needed anything. However, she went to the other tables.  While seated, another patron went to the cashier to ask for another spoon because the spoon on his table was \u201cextremely dirty.\u201d  After I finished my pho, I went to the register to pay for my food. The cashier attempted to charge me for the pho and spring rolls which I never received.  The experience was okay overall but not great!  I would go there again if in a pinch.",

However, this spot can learn a few things from the great pho spots in Northwest:  1) Food: The menu is diverse, including spring rolls, fried rice, noodles, and bubble milk to compliment the pho. Prices are average compared to other pho spots in the city. However, the flavor and quality aren't up to par. I ordered the spicy lemongrass beef pho and for being spicy it lacked flavor and a kick. The ingredients are sparse (usually they pile the bowl and plate with veggies, basil, etc) and the broth tasteless.  2) Service: The staff were friendly, but they forgot to bring us water and a few other items when there were only two other guests in the restaurant.  There are a few pluses:  1) Space: It's small on the side of H Street closest to Union Station. The inside is beautiful with two murals on the walls and a simple design. It looks good in photographs.  2) Milk tea: I didn't try it, but the fact that it's on the menu is a win.",
