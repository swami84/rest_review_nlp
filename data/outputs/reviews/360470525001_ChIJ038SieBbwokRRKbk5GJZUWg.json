This restaurant/ bar has a instagramable element to the environment. It\u2019s the perfect little spot to grab a bite with friends or go on a date. The staff was attentive and the food was filling and very good !  We got the pomegranate and peach soju ( which was great to share among a group of four ).  The chicken wings with soy garlic sauce was a MUST. They\u2019re shareable dishes we\u2019re all great.  I would stop by this place and check it out. I will be revisiting soon!",

They had a good variety of drinks, whether it was mixed drinks, beer or others (like soju). I got their jalapeno margarita 0w0, which was very good with a nice heat to it. And the food!!! I really like the korean fusion style of food. (Kind of sad that they didnt have tteokbooki on their menu but..  it's ok) For our first round, we ordered their fried chicken (half soy garlic and half sweet and spicy level 2) kimchi cheese fries and one of their spicy beef rice bowls. All were veryyyy good!! \ud83e\udd17 the fries were nice and crispy and really went well with the kimchi and cheese. Their chicken wings were good too but the spicy one... wasn't really what I expected... not spicy enough either. Because of this we got the second round of boneless fried chicken with their korean bbq flavor. This one was pretty good, compared to the sweet and spicy one. We also got another fries: the garlic butter parmesan cheese. This one was slightly sweeter than I expected... when eaten with the korean bbq chicken.. (which was on the saltier side...) but all was still good 0w0. I'm glad I found this place. We will definitely be visiting again in the future \ud83d\ude01",

I was throwing a birthday party for my wife and I wasn't aware of the updated food menu and was completely thrown off because there were some diet restrictions one of my wife's friend has. Harmony talked to the chef for me and the chef came out to discuss the menu with me and was able to make things from the old menu that they had for our group of 11-12 which was amazing. The food was great, I felt extremely welcome by every worker there including the manager, the cocktails are fantastic, we ended the night with some karaoke that they set up for us in the back and we danced. Such a gem of a place and you will be treated with nothing but kindness. Thank you for everything guys! We all had a great night.",

I ordered the spicy octopus and decided to try the fried squid legs. Got it to go.  The spicy octopus had great flavor I enjoyed it. But the fried squid legs were cold and had a old oil taste to it. It may have tasted better it they were hot. I called back to tell them about my experience with the food. And asked if I could bring the squid legs back and exchange for something else.  Needless to say at this point I didn\u2019t like the service. It was only about $5 on happy hour menu.  I was willing to walk back and exchange. This really killed the things that I liked about the restaurant.  Very disappointed because it was a cool Korean restaurant that I wanted to bring friends for a good experience.

The waitress came up to us two or three separate times, each time saying she\u2019d be with us in 5 minutes, and then disappeared. She never even brought menus, water, or drinks and we finally got up and left at 10:30pm.",
