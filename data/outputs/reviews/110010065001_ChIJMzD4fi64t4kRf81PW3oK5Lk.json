The sushi is always quality although I do stick with the basics I have enjoyed their special rolls.

Worse, it was room temperature warm making me fear I was going to get food poisoning. The woman who prepared my food, while she was very nice, kept pausing while preparing my sushi to text on her iPhone--- with her gloves on! So unsanitary! And worst of all, they had a small dog running around the restaurant including behind the sushi bar in the food preparation area.
