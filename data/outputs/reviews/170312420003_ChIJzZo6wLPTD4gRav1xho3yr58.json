I didn't think you actually had to have 4 people, just thought I was paying for the hire price Groupon. When they were closed they were going to honor take out so makes no sense. We had to ask for knives, chopsticks, and soy sauce. Sushi was nothing special, go to butterfly for sushi.  I am giving two stars bc the pork buns and walnut shrimp were delish. You would think at this point they would be in need for repeat customers(only one other table in there).",

The menu is also massive and there are so many options, I try to order something new each time I'm here. It's a great place to take people because there is something for everyone, even people who don't like sushi. There's Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Taiwanese cuisine just to name a few.  The miso soup is only $2 and it's very good, with plenty of tofu. I got the triple S sushi roll - shrimp tempura, crab meat, cream cheese, avocado, masago, tobiko, eel sauceand spicy mayo, and topped with baked salmon. The roll was a little on the pricier side, $15 and a bit on the smaller side but it was very good. Definitely my favorite roll from here. I really like the spicy house noodles from here. Pad Thai is also good!  The staff is always so nice every time I come here. Definitely one of the best Asian takeout/delivery places in wicker park, they are open until 2 am everyday besides Sunday.",
