I asked the server and she checked with the manager and they had to agree with me that they must not do this.

When we were seated the waitress informed us that she would need to hold one of our ID's because they get a large number of walkouts. We obliged. From that moment on the service was poor. We barely got checked on. Through out the hour we were there we were seen by multiple servers and ours was no where to be found. It was busy so we had a wait for our food. We understood that and did not complain. When we got our food each person was not satisfied with their meal. The food was rather lackluster. After we all had finished our meals it took 10-15 minutes for us to get the check (by the way they do not split checks so we all had to split one check). The servers were taking too long to come back so one of my friends had to get up and take our money into the restaurant so that we could pay, retrieve our friend's ID, and leave. It had been expressed to my friend that the waitress only asked for the ID's of the two tables with Black people in our area. The White people in our area were not required to hand over an ID. So we were racially profiled, the food sucked, and the service was trash. Save your time and money and eat somewhere else.",

Once the good came it was cold which was shocking due to the fact we were the only people in the restaurant actually ordering food . The food was horrible the cheese was watery , the chips were soggy , for an additional $2 I got 3 pieces of steak . The cut sizes were I in-proportional . the taste was extremely bland and the guacamole was missing from my nachos .

First, my girl's dish was incorrect, it took about 50 minutes for them to correct it. Then, one of my girls was jokingly talking stuff about our other friend (Simply how we get along). When this waitress who was cleaning the table next to us, got so defensive thinking that my girl was talking about her. Not once did my friend spoke about her nor even noticed that she was cleaning the table. The waitress started talking about \"if we are going to be disrespectful about her, then we should leave\". Not only that but who knows who sent a security guard - talking about that we needed to get out. All we were waiting was to pay for our food, but no one was coming to cash us out. Till eventually, the owner came. (He was kind enough to discount for my friend's meal since it took forever). He had informed us that the waitress name is Nancy. She never apologized to my friend or anything. We were confused and frustrated that this even happened when we simply wanted to enjoy our evening. Definitely never stepping foot in this establishment ever again!",

Served temperature hot and they didn't give very much for the amount of chips that were given. We ordered the carne asada tacos and they were absolutely DELICIOUS. Being from AZ and having had some pretty awesome Mexican food we weren't expecting much. The huge margaritas were only $9 and our waitress was super friendly and attentive.

We waited way too long for our food, basically sitting there forever with empty glasses and empty bowls where the chips/salsa were.  Eventually we just wanted to pay for the drinks and leave.  I could understand if the place was busy, but it wasn't.  We watched our waiters clear off tables while we sat there with empty glasses.  The food came just as we were leaving, so we sat down and ate.  The food was decent, but there are lots of other, better places with decent food and far better service.",

It was a short walk considering where we were walking from but there is plenty of parking all around this location.  We were taken to a seat quickly but they were not busy.  The restaurant is small and kind of dark and has no windows but plenty of tv's on the wall. The menu is a little pricey compared to others locally but could be because of its location close to navy pier. We were brought hot tortilla chips and a warm salsa that was quite tasty.  We decided on the margarita flight which gives you 5 8oz margaritas. They were brought out in a nice carrier/holder.  The margaritas were very well made and I could see myself enjoying these more frequently.  We ordered the ceviche which was dryer than what I am used to and did lack some heat and saltiness.  It was still ok but I will probably not order it again. We decided to order the combo fajitas which gives you shrimp,  steak and chicken.  The fajitas were not bad but the steak appeared a bit tough to chew.  The shrimp still had the tail on so make sure you pull tails off first.  I am more accustomed to seeing the tails removed for fajitas but it's their choice.  Warm tortillas and fajitas were definitely filling.  We decided to order the fried ice cream as well. This took quite some time to get but was worth the wait.  I suggest you order dessert before you are done to give them adequate time.  All in all the meal was worth going and we will be back.  Total time at restaurant was 2 hours so make sure you have time.  Some times good food can't be rushed.  I recommend this restaurant to all locals and those visiting who wish so good Mexican food.",
