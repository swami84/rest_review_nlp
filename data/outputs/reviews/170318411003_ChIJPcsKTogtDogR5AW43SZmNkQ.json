Noodles are a little light but in contrary I like my food really really salty  Must try - Braised everything, make sure you get the garlic sauce! Absolutely in love!  I could tell all the staff are very genuine and kind, that\u2019s a huge plus that I love especially in Chinese restaurants.  Will come back again, will update my review if needed.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if the pork belly and tripe are put in a box for me. The amount is very small. I really will not go there anymore.
