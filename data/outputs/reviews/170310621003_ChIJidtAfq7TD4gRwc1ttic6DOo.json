The Pad see ewe was bad as well tasting a few days old.  I don't write reviews at all, but I had to write this one because of how bad it tasted.",

To Drink - can't go wrong with a sweet and refreshing Thai Iced Tea, perfect for keeping cool through any spicy bites! Entrees - I love Pad Thai, it's my go-to at every Thai restaurant, so I've seen it all. P.S. Bangkok's Pad Thai was great because of the quality ingredients, large portion, and best of all, they provide the spice on the side so you can add as much as you want, perfect for Anyone, from spice-addicts to people who want to enjoy Pad Thai but aren't big fans of spice. I loved it. The Stir-fried Seafood Curry is on a whole other level. The perfect combination if seafood mixed with a mildly spicy curry, basil and pepper, with a side of perfectly steamed, sticky white rice. This was served in a beautiful flower-designed arrangment, in a portion large enough for two to split. Save room for dessert! The fresh fruits and sweet, milky rice are absolutely worth it! Service: Phenomenal. The server took such great care of us! They were friendly, helpful, attentive, and made us feel right at home. I love them! The food came in short amounts of time, and the ambience of the restaurant is so comfortable yet elegant, I was stunned. Price: Very affordable. The quality of this food is on par with the fanciest restaurants you can find, but the pricing is easily half of what you'd pay elsewhere. The service is perfect, and leaves nothing wanting. Basically, the best bang for your buck you can hope to find.",

She really knew how to pick out something I wouldn't have tried for myself but that would really make me happy. She has a whole menu and program for large groups; teachers, you can call ahead and bring a group up to a hundred if you're going to a local museum. Otherwise, it doesn't seem like it's often crowded, which is a real shame for such good food and great service!",

Duck still had some bone and could have been crispier, and the lemon sauce absolutely ruined the dish. My crispy noodles ended up soggy, so I didn't eat much of it.  Service was okay, although my friend got force-fed the last piece of beef and a lecture on Asians fighting over the bill.  Lunch specials not valid on Sundays, even though it says so on the menu.",
