They open at 10:30am but Leonardo seated us even though the kitchen isn't open yet. We ordered pomegranate mimosa's instead and it was delicious. The ambiance was really well done. They have partitions that included plants for Covid-19 safety. Amazing food. I will highly suggest to try their 8 course vegan meal. We ordered 3 bottles of sparkling rose and couldn't finish the last one so we took it home.",

I also had the salmon entree with lentils, spinach and raviolini. I love lentils and they were small and perfectly cooked. The combination of textures and flavors was amazing and well balanced. I also ordered the ratatouille because it\u2019s a favorite of mine and it worked with the other dishes. Everything was fresh and HOT when I got it home, a ten minute walk from the restaurant. I loved my dinner and there was some of everything left over for tomorrow. I can\u2019t wait to eat here again.",

Renting the private room was a breeze however the service was just okay. This is understandable due to COVID as I\u2019m assuming they may be understaffed. Anyhow, the gazpacho, crispy artichokes, and swordfish were delicious! I\u2019d order them again in a heartbeat. The berry cheesecake was just okay and despite the glowing reviews, hubby said the vegan mac was not good. The top layer was the best part but the noodles were bland and didn\u2019t have any of the stretch that Mac should have. (I know it\u2019s vegan but I also know ingredients like tapioca starch can provide stretch). I called ahead to inquire about gluten free options and I\u2019d estimate that about 25% of the menu was GF friendly. Unfortunately they didn\u2019t have any gf pastas on hand so all the pasta dishes were off limits for me. Overall a good experience and I definitely want to try their brunch...once more GF items are on the menu.",

The next two salad courses were also very good (a bulgar salad topped with cherries and a English cucumber and beet salad). The next three courses were a stuffed French toast rolled in granola, an \"egg\" frittata, and spinach pasta (as in pasta made with spinach) with pesto. I only enjoyed the French toast but with the caveat that it was definitely more just toast slices with jam in-between them. The egg frittata was very sweet and I didn't finish it. The spinach pasta was also sweet and there wasn't a hint of pesto. The last course had five desserts. I only liked the blueberry crumble. Everything else was either nothing special or just not good. Especially the fudgy brownie.  All that said, everything else about the restaurant was really good and I want to give it another try for dinner or a different brunch menu.",

Six of us dined and each thoroughly  enjoyed several of the creative and delicious culinary creations on the menu.  Nice decor and relatively quiet dining rooms were a plus.  Our waiter was very attentive, knowledgeable and eager to please. The pace of the meal was perfect and we lingered at our leisure. After dinner we were served complementary glasses of dessert wine. Overall a great experience and we will definitely return.",

Randy, our waiter, was phenomenal. He made the experience even more fun and special with a joke for us every time he came to the table. We had multiple courses but the menu changes seasonally so we enjoyed some nice fall options like pumpkin soup. My wife was delighted by the many plant-based options and the lamb was delicious as well. The drinks had recently changed to a menu with all book titles; loved the rum diary and the catcher in the rye. Roman, Brett, and Randy(and I\u2019m sure the rest of the staff) are truly wonderful. Literally the best treatment I have ever received at a restaurant. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area.",

All of the food was delicious, especially the pasta. The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is the service- rather than move around the table to offer descriptions of the plates to our party, there was a brief word from the server at one corner of the table- in a noisy restaurant, this was not ideal. With the wine pairing, we were told what the wine (i.e. the grape varietal) was for each course, but not where it was from, nor why it was being paired with the specific courses. The wine for each coursed arrived around 5 minutes after the food, which was not optimal. All in all we had a wonderful experience.",

The bartender scooped it up and offered my friend a free glass of wine. Odd because it was in front of me  Also, a gentleman came to sit next to me. He seemed annoyed that I couldn\u2019t move over more, but my friend on the other side had people next to her so we little room to shift. The gentleman next to me got amazing service and few visits from the Chef. I did. It have that experience. Overall last night\u2019s visit was disappointing. I expected more.",

While this is an amazing concept, and something I wish we had available all the time in every city,  the actual food part of the brunch was a touch underwhelming. There weren't a huge number of options (really like 7 or so) and some were incredibly simple like a salad, plain pancakes, and grilled asparagus. The real stars of the show were the pineapple gazpacho (I would literally swim in a pool of that it was so tasty and very complex with the mint and cucumber), the walnut French toast rhubarb sandwiches, and the dessert table (SO good). Everything else was just alright and not really moving. Mostly just simple food that is already easily vegan at normal restaurants and wasn't quite as hot as it should have been. The staff though was absolutely excellent and really so kind throughout the whole brunch.  Would I go again? Probably not for the $52 it ended up costing with a coffee (why is this an extra $5 again???), tax, and tip but it wasn't a bad experience at all, just simple for the price.",

Words can't even describe how delicious their food is. And the fact that they are trying to also impact the amount of food wasted in the restaurant industry is amazing. My family and I attended their Not Wasted dinner, a dinner created around the movement of not wasting as much food in the restaurant industry, and in general, and on educating the attendees about the amount of food wasted in households, but also in the restaurant industry, and why we should care about it, and how it affects the environment as well as the ecosystem. And the dinner they served attendees, BEYOND delicious. And it was made from things you normally would have thrown away, like carrot shavings, lettuce stems, etc. The menu they created for that night was delicious. They had another Not Wasted dinner yesterday, 04/22, to celebrate Earth Day (even though I'm sure they all acknowledge the fact that every day is Earth Day) and I wish I could have attended. But the menu looked just as delicious as their initial Not Wasted dinner menu, and their regular, seasonal menus that they have. In general the restaurant has amazing food. The photos included are from their main menu as well as their first Not Wasted dinner in February. This is one restaurant I highly recommend trying out. Chef Todd Gray and his wife Ellen have created an amazing restaurant and amazing environment for their guests to eat in, as well as an amazingly tasty vegan menu that I recommend everyone try!",

Ellen of Equinox asked if we could visit earlier to allow for their staff to make it home safely. What caring consideration!!! My friend and I (over)indulged to our healthy hearts\u2019 content as Roman, our waiter, provided excellent service. The head chef/owner stopped by to chat with us as well.

Our waiter included two complementary drinks and an anniversary card signed by owner Todd Gray. The food is delightful, delicately prepared, nicely presented and flavorful. Great options for vegans and omnivores. The porcini mushroom starter is a playful twist on pasta and the falafel salad is both refreshing with a hint of heat. The pork tenderloin and salmon are perfectly cooked and flavorful. Vegan desserts are amazing, especially the dark chocolate cheesecake. The salted caramel tart is also a hit! Highly recommended",

We were treated with a complementary appetizer: slices of a fig with a few veggies on top. Not sure it is a gerular menu item. The menu is not overwhelmingly long but there is a choice of everything: vegetarian, fish, chicken, beef, and lamb. We ordered an appetizer: grilled octopus which they split into two plates for us to share. Great size portion and great presentation! Cooked just right and set on top of some veggies. I ordered a vegetarian mushroom dish and my companion ordered fish. Both dishes came in a timely manner. Food was hot and well prepared. Nice presentation! Good size portions. We were very happy with food quality! I didn't find the desert list very interesting but they have a good selection on hot teas. The desert we ordered was just ok. But we are usually not into deserts. Service was great! Our server was attentive but not overwhelming hanging over our shoulders. The atmosphere is very pleasant and it was not very noisy outside after 8 pm. Pleasant experience overall!",

The gumbo, stroganoff, and potatoes were all perfect. My friends came for the ample vegan options. But there were great meat and fish options too. I recommend the flounder or the bacon wrapped venison. A day later and I'm already thinking about my next visit.",

The waiter first described the special as a large filet of rockfish; I was served what appeared to be exactly 4 ounces. Beautifully cooked and presented on a bed of halved brussel sprouts and other veggies, but still basically a 3 inch square piece of fish, see photo. When asked the price of the special the waiter first said it was probably the same as the other fish dishes on the menu, in the low 20 dollar range. And it would have been fine at that price, but no, it was $10 more. The waiter had no idea of what the Yule log was. However it proved tasty enough, although the accompanying chestnut gelato was the highlight of the meal, see photo. Interesting experience but I see no reason to return.",

        "caption": "I am a vegetarian so I loved having Equinox as an option in the business lunch scene dominated by steakhouses, but it pains me to say I will not be coming back. Average entree is $20-ish for lunch. I ordered the special, a vegetarian pasta with brussel sprout leaves, parmesan and truffle oil. Get the check, it's $56. I balk and ask why on earth if a special is three times the price of every other pasta on the menu, they would not say so. Waiter says no one ever asks (BECAUSE YOU SHOULD VOLUNTEER THAT HIGHLY COUNTER-INTUITIVE INFORMATION) and said he would discount the price. It was discounted $8 to the appetizer portion. He tells me white truffle is thousands of dollars and people don't always know that. That is obnoxious, and a reason why you should say the price. I guess it's expensive but I don't know how much and shouldn't be expected to factor that in. This is not an \"obvious\" luxury item like filet mignon with a side of foie gras. You can get truffle mac or truffle fries at your neighborhood Olive Garden. Also, I didn't love the \"special\" and thought it was oily. I have eaten here before and had a good experience, but this was unbelievable. You cannot just scam customers this way just because you typically have a business crowd. Concealing information from your customers is not a way to show how \"upscale\" you are, it is downright dishonest. You lost a repeat customer.  ***EDITED: The managers were very persistent in calling me back and apologizing for the situation and have offered to comp the price of a future meal. I was happy to hear they have implemented a policy chance and now print the special, along with the price, on the menu (which is really the only fix I was interested in). Raising to 3-stars because I appreciate them implementing a change.",
