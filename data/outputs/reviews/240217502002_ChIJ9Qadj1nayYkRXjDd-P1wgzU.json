If you want a good sushi restaurant experience for dining out, Lazy Fish is the spot to go to in downtown Frederick.

Not only do they drive to New Market which is at least a fifteen minute drive and bring me my soup for no charge. They gave me a coupon AND free dumplings for their mistake. I\u2019ve been her dozens of times already. Not only is the sushi delicious, but the customers service is great too.

We got there, and a very unpleasant hostess tried to debate us for why we didn\u2019t want to be the first people sitting upstairs.  We are pretty polite and told her sitting in an empty room makes us uncomfortable.  She seemed offended, and when she took us to a different table made sure we understood we needed to leave in 90 minutes.  We almost left in 90 seconds after dealing with her and we would have missed out on a wonderful experience, with a terrific waitress and delicious food.  We are good tippers and happy customers and loved our experience, but would probably turn around and leave if we went again and the same mean miserable girl was the hostess.",

We walked up 2 flights of stairs and this place was packed, tables filled with people less than 6 ft apart, at this point I was like they shouldn't have any issues at all. The hostesses meet us with masks and asked if we had any we said we didn't and forgot them. They told us for them to allow us to walk 5ft to our table we needed masks. I asked if they provided any because we didn't have any. They said no and said to leave. Because they already got a fine for allowing people to just walk to there table. Very rude hospitality in there tone of voice and definitely not a place I plan to visit again. Especially since tables weren't even spread apart far enough to be following guidelines.

All of the food tasted so fresh and filled us right up! We got sat pretty much immediately which surprised me since it was a Saturday during Valentine's weekend and prime lunch rush. I am only sad that I ordered a side salad that I didn't get- but like I said I was in a sushi coma, and I didn't get charged for it on my ticket so no harm no foul. It is a really cute spot and would recommend anyone in Frederick check it out!",

All good.  By the time my Beef Bulgogi Noodle soup arrived I was already pretty full. No problem. Leftovers were delicious! Service as I said was excellent.

The menu was moderately priced. We had all that\u2019s pictured, a soda and with tip it was $83. The Nigiri had thick slices of fish, unlike most restaurants in the area. The fish quality was excellent. The lemongrass soup was an amazing symphony of flavor served at the perfect temperature. Not one thing was unimpressive here and we left full and satiated. Loved this restaurant and definitely will be back again.",

Our server had a really fun personality and he was definitely on top of things, despite being the only server for the entire place. We sat at the bar, which is always a good time if you like watching the chefs work  Our sushi was very fresh and was delicious! The sashimi dish we had was a great variety, and it got me to try a few new things. The cuts of fish are very generous.",

We had a big party and regardless of being a Saturday night at peak time, they made every effort to accommodate us quickly. We waited very little and the service provided by everyone from the hostess to the waitress was phenomenal. Even while leaving they all were very gracious. We began with some delicious warm sake, Sapporo beer, and a delicious house made drink pictured below. Then we had lots of sushi rolls, all of them good. Then the udon soup was perfect to the point our little one love it. Then we had the drunken noodles to top it all. Wonderful experience. A must try if you are in downtown Frederick or simply nearby.",

We walked up to the host, and he asked if we had a reservation. We didn't know we needed one. He literally scoffed at us, put his nose in the air, and laughed that we didn't have one. After he calmed down from his hysterical fit, he told us that it would be a half hour to an hour wait. So after the rude customer service, we left. There would have not been a problem if he just let us know about the wait. Not visiting again :)",

They were not very crowded and we were seated quickly, though the entrance gets cramped if there are more than a couple people waiting to be seated. Our waitress was very friendly and came by several times to check on the table, refilling waters, etc. The food was delicious! We ordered two items from their specials: the Tuna Pistachios appetizer with mango salsa (pictured) and the Shoyu Ramen. The ramen broth was very flavorful. We also shared sushi rolls (pictured): eel avocado, Mt. Fuji, and the Peking Pork. The Mt. Fuji was our favorite but they were all tasty. Would highly recommend this place and we will be going back soon!",

This isn't your run-of-the-mill sushi place with everything drowning in spicy mayo. After looking at the menu, the designer cocktails and the creative specials (and pricing), I expected to be impressed.  I have been to this restaurant three times now and each time, sadly, I am not as impressed as I should be. I think my issue is with the quality of the waitstaff. I say this because tonight I gave this trendy downtown sushi joint one last try. And like the last two times I left feeling like I didn't have the best experience. Here's what transpired:  We ordered a selection of fun appetizers and cocktails: the mondu (dumplings), calamari and salmon carpaccio. My friends beer arrived on time but I was left to wait for my hot sake. Our first appetizer arrived...the salmon. I waited because I still didn't have my sake and I was hoping we could pick and share at our multiple appetizers whilst sipping on our cocktails. This never happened.  After about 15 minutes we decided to eat our salmon dish. A few minutes later our mondu arrived. Still no sake but the waiter never stopped to ask how things were. He simply placed the next appetizer on the table and wandered off.  We waited a bit but he never showed up to ask how everything was or if we needed anything. Another 15 minutes passed and he showed up with the calamari. At this point our experience is already 2/3 over and I don't have my cocktail. I ask again for my sake but switch the order from a large sake to small since we are pretty much done eating. He plays it off like this is no big deal and says oops I forgot it in the microwave. Eeeek. This is upscale sushi restaurant. At least sincerely apologize!  My hot sake arrives last. He could have asked my friend if he wanted another beer at this point but misses the mark again. We ended up eating individual appetizers in small, sad courses and for me with no cocktail. Calamari was fine. Mondu was fine. Salmon Carpaccio was too oily and I don't think it was sesame oil on it so it tasted like it was supposed to be salad but only oil was drizzled over it. I might not have noticed this if I had my sake from the start but I was deprived of this early on.  The waiter arrives at last to FINALLY ask if we need anything now that the meal is over. This would have been helpful early on or even mid-meal. We ask for our check and in my eyes this is a fail. This is now my third and last visit to this 'upscale' sushi joint. The service isn't worth what I paid for the food and my experience kinda sucked.  Still looking for a good sushi joint in Frederick that doesn't smother everything in spicy mayo but takes care of their customers. Please let me know if you've found one!!",
