        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Sichuan cuisine has grown in Hawaii. The first time was Beef noodle, but I felt a little unsatisfactory, so I asked Tandan for a second visit. I asked if the spiciness was modest or normal, so I ordered it normally. The customer was me alone, but it took 7-8 minutes to come out. It will take time to boil the noodles.  Noodles have a firmness and are sticky. The \u201cmami\u201d and spiciness of the yam are modest, and there is a kindness such as Sichuan home cooking. The soy sauce-based sauce and minced pork are delicious with tangy noodles. There was a spicy sauce on the table, but it was past 9pm, so I ate it without using it. There is no soup that is eaten in authentic Sichuan Province.  The owner is a white husband and a wife from Sichuan. They were both friendly and asked if they were delicious or spicy. Homely atmosphere is very good. There is a parking lot in front of the store, but since it stops from the head, it will return to Kalakaua and leave the car. It's okay at night, but it's a bit melancholy when there is heavy daytime traffic.  As an aside, it seems that the owner of the foot massage shop next door runs the store. $ 35 / hour, exceptional in Hawaii. A style of massage with a reclining chair. I went there at the beginning of the store, but my skills are in the middle. Expectation in the future. (Revisited in mid-April, the number of masseurs increased and the skill improved.

So amazing was the taste of the combination of the multiple ingredients in the sauce (peanuts, black bean, sesame, five star anise?) Then the texture of the noodle was out of this world just the right level of tender, not mushy and not hard to chew. Also had some of my neighbor\u2019s cucumber salad with garlic sesame paste I think and bamboo salad with subtle flavors, both delicious! Hope to be back soon to try the other dishes.

My friend had the couple's lung (tendon, tripe, and tongue) dish and loved it too! I also heard that they're offering homemade ice cream too but ran out tonight. Boo! I'll definitely be back!  Joy Cup is more than just a shaved ice & smoothie shop. This place is a hidden gem for foodies and offers some absolutely delicious and flavorful Chinese Sichuan dishes, Dan Dan Mien, Sichuan Beef Noodles, and handmade Blanket Noodles to name a few. The noodles are delightful and are made from a family recipe. The amount of spice is just right; it doesn't mute out the flavorfulness of the dish. This is a new start-up restaurant so please drop by for a bite. You'll be treated to some delicious food (Sichuan and other dishes, such as taco rice, loco moco too!) and service by co-owners Rick and Lulu.  Update: 2nd visit and this time I tried the shave ice. Wow! Hands down one of the best shaved ice places I've been to on island! Powder soft shaved ice with REAL fruit flavor,  no food coloring/artificial stuff! Same thing goes for the fruit juices and smoothies, made from real fruit! Sooooo ono!",

We we're staying at the Modern Hotel and needed a quick early lunch before heading to the airport. Arrived at 11am and the two of us ordered cucumber salad, pot stickers, and small bowls of dan Dan noodles and beef noodle soup.  Ordered both medium spicy.  Both we're so very good, and the pot stickers were delicious and seemed freshly homemade.  The cucumber salad is served with a delicious sesame soy sauce dressing, very yummy.  Even more wonderful is that they serve shave ice too, had a small shave ice for dessert (onolicious).  The owners of this place, a retired Marine from Texas and his Chinese wife are so nice and make fabulous food at very affordable price.  Do yourself a favor and wander over here for a great lunch or dinner and shave ice and a relaxing foot massage next door.  Both we're some of the best deals and best experiences we had on the island!  We will be back and leaving with very happy tummy.",
