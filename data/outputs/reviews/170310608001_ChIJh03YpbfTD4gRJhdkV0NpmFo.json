When delivery arrived the guacamole was missing. Instead of complaining I just went to the restaurant and kindly showed them my order and asked them for the missing guac. I simply assumed it is no big deal and they will either provide a refund or just hand me the dish. Instead they said write down your information and we will send a free guac next time you order. I patiently explained that this is not the way to handle it and if this is how they want to go about it, I probably won't be ordering from them any more. They simply did not care for the fact that I paid $10 for a guac that they never provided. And they did not feel like it was their obligation to make it right. So instead of dealing with this kind of attitude ever again, I am taking my future business elsewhere.  Mistakes do happen, what matters is how you handle it. And  to my amazement the manager was just nasty about it.",

Not only did the restaurant lose the reservation but I was seated outside in the cold because of it. To add to that, it took almost 15 minutes to place a drink order with the server and almost 20 minutes for a food order to be placed. I understand that Sunday brunch can be a busy time which is why I placed the reservation the day before (not even a full 24 hours) using my full name and phone #.  Losing it is one thing and can be chalked up to employee error. But providing poor service on top of that is an entirely different story.",

She barely visited our table and it took about 30-45 minutes for my friends to receive their two Margaritas. We were her only table outside and upon leaving I saw only 2 tables inside so it's not like she was busy. As a side note she was also standing extremely close to me and bumping/almost leaning into into my leg which made me extremely uncomfortable-personal space??  She also charged us for an extra margarita which I unfortunately only noticed after paying. Man at host stand asked for my card and I was expecting a refund, he then charged me again for lower price and explained (after I asked about it) that their tabs close out at 3 am so I will not be double charged. My bank account shows the higher amount as pending so I still do not know if this was properly handled.",

Just a few days ago, we celebrated our first anniversary and had a small group from our wedding party join us to celebrate. With so much turmoil and uneasiness in these COVID times, El Mariachi could supply a dose of familiarity and normalcy. Our group was larger than the standard maximum of 6, so the restaurant got us two six-tops next to each other, which still allowed us to converse.  Luis was the man who helped out with every step of the way when we planned our wedding, and he was there during our anniversary dinner. He was around to talk with us for a bit, pour some champagne, and even had someone show up to take pictures! It was so delightful! He filled us in on a Day of the Dead tequila dinner happening in a few weeks, and it sounds fantastic. We ordered a few pitchers of margaritas because we believe they are the best around, and could probably win a margarita competition now that I think about it.  El Mariachi has been so lovely to us. When we didn't know what appetizers or food to order, the server (Julio) was able to help us out. He was patient when we were silly and couldn't focus. They were able to bring the food out altogether, which was nice. They didn't rush us out immediately after 90 minutes, and they allowed us to take our time and chat after our meal. We were there in the later dinner hours, so that helped. It didn't look like anyone was waiting for our tables.  El Mariachi continues to treat us like family and serve delicious margaritas and food. We ordered churros for dessert, and I thought my husband would die of tasty food overload. They were so delicious. We will continue going back to the restaurant when we get the chance. Thank you!",

I really wanted one with each of the sauces but they can only do one sauce for all of it and then I had to pay to get the other sauces on the side.  My friend got the taco salad and she really enjoyed it.",

Everything started and ended ok, so I thought... until I saw my credit card bill.. our bill was $66 and some change however, my credit card was charged $79.43.. Please note we tipped our server $20 in CASH... meaning there was no reason for my card to be fraudulently charged an additional $13 .. I contacted the restaurant today immediately after I saw the charge and I spoke with the manager (Michael) and explained to him my issue.. Michael was attentive and empathetic.. Michael also stated that he would have the person that is in charge of the transactions to look into it and give me a call back... I am highly disgusted that the server illegally applied an additional $13 to my bill.. I will not allow him to get away with this... it makes me wonder how many times has this happened to other patrons of this establishment... and shall I be concerned that my credit card information was copied and will be used for other unauthorized purchases by this person.. What a greedy horrible person, we tipped you $20 in CASH ... I hope stealing from me was worth it... I will never return here again, nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

The flavors are great the presentation is beautiful and the quality of ingredients is fantastic.  Now is this authentic Mexican? No, but it has enough of those iconic flavors to give you a great eating experience that's pretty close to what Mexican cuisine is.  Are the portions big? No, and this is where things start going down hill. The portions are very small considering how expensive this food is, and it is very expensive.  Price: $40 per person including appetizers and and drinks and before tip.  Now you might be thinking, \" Hey that's not that bad. It's pretty standard for the area.\" Well, not exactly. There are plenty of places where you can get high quality Mexican for a fraction of the price without compromising on the portions.  Eating here makes you realize you might be playing more for the building lease than the actual food.  Drinks: This is where I lost all respect.  They had special margarita pitchers, which might have been the worst margaritas I have ever had.  If I could describe them I would say they are watered down, Minute Maid powder mix margaritas with some random tequila mixed in.  No sense of presentation. No sense of quality or freshness... I have had cheaper and better.  The service:  In terms of service this restaurant is actually doing something right. The staff is very patient and friendly. They made the experience worth the wait.  I will note that they started cleaning and picking up the chairs all around us which made it feel like they wanted us out.  This is disappointing, specially since we were barely eating. And they did not come back to offer more drinks which made it feel like they might have wanted us out.  Ambiance:  The place is decent sized. Not big but not small. It's clean and the decor is cute. Bathrooms were very clean which is always a plus.  Bottom line:  This place has very good food and good service for me though the prices do not meet the portions and the drinks don't come to the level the food is at which is a huge deal breaker.  I wouldn't mind coming here if invited but would probably not pick it on my own because I feel there are better alternatives. Having said that, of you do come here I feel you would have a decent time... as long as you are not here near closing, in which case you might notice them putting up the chairs around you to give you a hint to wrap it up.",

They have a great outdoor patio in the summer.  The food is also perfectly seasoned and they have great options for vegetarians. I loved the enchiladas with maduros (sweet plantains) as well as the veggie fajitas.  Highly recommend! The bar area is also great if you are just dining solo.",

We heard groups talking and they did not have reservations. If the restaurant is honoring ALL reservations over walk-ins, they should tell people reservations only.

The Aztecs combo represents the vegetarian choices well, and the shrimp burrito In the Del Ranchero combo has wo detful nuance  In fact, the various combo plates include several parts of the menu that are worth exploring on repeat visits.

The chips they left we're good but once salsa was served warm almost hot.  Server finally took our order and drinks took another 10 minutes to arrive.  My frozen margarita was barely blended with big chunks of ice.  My husband's beer was luke warm & tasted stale.  Our food was actually good.  Server never came to check on us and ignored us when we asked for the check.  My husband had to chase her down.  Overall, the food was good, but not good enough to risk trying again in case it was an off night.  This is not a place I would come back to again.",

This time the only thing that was good was the food. We had no idea who our waitress was given that it took about 15 minutes to get someone to ask if we had been taken care of. We didn't receive utensils until after our food arrived because we asked for them. The waitress that took our order was Janet G. According to our receipt. And to top it off I got charged $18.50 for a margarita that should have been $12. The most frustrating part was that she continued to check on the table a foot from us but ignored my husband and I.

It was a horrible set up for tables and a tight squeeze that made ppl uncomfortable. Within two feet a woman was having a baby shower with another tight squeeze. The food was cold when we finally received it. My friend had the server break a glass and spill a drink on her. Then towards the end they told us that we could only use 4 cards  and refused to split the bill by seat to distinguish who received what food to pay for. They also tried to say we owed money but really they counted wrong.  The customer service was absolutely horrible until I spoke with the weekend manager and expressed my concerns after my guests left.  Don\u2019t book for large groups here. Save your time and money.

The food was great! The mimosa's, better! This is the reason for my 2 stars.  The unlimited mimosa's were offered to us with a 2 hour window in which the table can enjoy. This wasn't a problem as our waiter stated he'll make sure the glasses remained full. This clearly became a problem as the waiter only visit the table approximately 3 times and they stopped serving the Mimosa's 15 minutes prior to the end of our 2 hour window. We received more service from the busboy then we did our waiter.  The problem I believe had to do with the table next to us being filled with nothing but friends/possible regulars of the waiter. They received more drinks, and their food well before our table. They also arrived 30 minutes after we were seated.  Although the food was great, I will not be returning to this establishment, and I set with a table of 10 others who all felt the same.",
