        "caption": "A challenger appears in Logan Square! My quest for the best Chinese food continues! Is it \u201cTasty Chinese Food\u201d (great trick to manipulate search results lol) in name only?  Prices are pretty standard for low-end Chinese fast food joints which is surprising because of the location. The prices themselves are either the same or lower than pretty much all the other Chinese restaurants in the area. On the menu I spot a nice surprise\u2026Peking Duck! They also have actual fish here too which other restaurants like China Fast Wok for some odd don\u2019t have. I order my \u201cChinese Try-Out Package\u201d which consist of staples like Orange Chicken & Mongolian Beef lunch specials (a try-out package isn\u2019t complete without a helping of egg rolls & fried rice.) I also ordered the fried chicken wings & duck lunch specials with a side of crab Rangoon. The lunch specials are $6.95 from 11am-3pm & 7.95 after 3pm which is a great deal. Even the duck lunch special was only $1 more than the rest (whether that is good or bad we\u2019ll find out\u2026)  First is the duck of course! Now Peking duck this cheap is alarming, but I\u2019m willing to give it a chance. From the looks of things they give you half a bird which in itself is $15 on the menu so it\u2019s a steal here. It doesn\u2019t however look to be prepared Peking style, it\u2019s just normal roasted duck, not even thinly sliced. To be fair the lunch special doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201cPeking\u201d duck, just that it\u2019s duck. All other pictures of duck dishes the restaurant advertises show a traditional \u201cPeking Duck\u201d though. The duck is obviously cheap meat, but decent. The skin was nicely roasted albeit it is a bit over seasoned (too much salt.) If you\u2019re looking for a quick fix this seems to be the place. The meat was tender as well. Hardly any fat was on the duck too which was nice.  Ah, next is my nemesis the \u201corange sponge\u201d (and no I\u2019m not talking about a certain U.S. president.) A quick taste of the orange sauce brings me hope. The sauce is traditional orange sauce that is sweet, but not too sweet. I bit into the sponge\u2026yep it\u2019s spongy. The chicken is not fried long enough & stayed too long in the sauce so what you have is a spongy mess, albeit a tasty one. The sauce compliments the middle tier chicken well. Other than the texture I have no complaints.  A quick detour into sides we have the fried rice, egg rolls, & crab Rangoon. The fried rice has all the makings of a great fried rice, but falls just short when it comes to flavor.  It features eggs, scallions & bean sprouts, all hallmarks of great fried rice. The meat however is a mid-tier quality and overall the dish doesn\u2019t have the vibrant flavor that great fried rice has as if they missed that one seasoning that would\u2019ve changed it from a fine dish to godlike status. This works out though since it forces you to focus on the main dish & not the rice itself. The egg rolls are your standard frozen ones that have been reheated. They were nice enough to throw in an extra veggie egg roll to. The crab Rangoon was a perfect golden brown & looked absolutely appetizing. My initial bite was greeting with mostly air & bread though. The second bite proved fruitful as the mine of crab mix started flowing into my mouth. It was tasty indeed, although they could fix them up with a lot more mix. I\u2019ve seen places packed their crab Rangoon to the brim, but I guess this isn\u2019t one of those places.  Overall despite it\u2019s misses this place is still up there with the best of the low-end Chinese joints. It can\u2019t compete with the likes of an actual restaurant like Silom 12, but for a quick cheap place for lunch this is hard to beat. You get the standard massive deals that are the lunch specials & special surprises like duck that are on the menu. If sweet sauces aren\u2019t your thing stay away from the Mongolian Beef. The fried rice just misses the plateau to be great by an inch, but is good nonetheless. A solid 4 star restaurant that with a few recipe tweaks could make a major difference.",

They did not hold back on the sauce (which is amazing!). My tofu came with white rice, which for me was enough for two meal servings. Also ordered a Chocolate Cake Shake - DELICIOUS. Everything was fairly priced and prepared fast for carry-out order. Definitely recommended!",

        "caption": "One of my new favorite places. In short good price, great taste, highly recommend.  So for any restaurant the most important part to me is the taste. I've had a lot of Chinese food and this place really tastes like home. I tried their roasted duck (made in house) and it was as good as anything I could get in China-town. Highly recommend the roasted duck. The other food was fresh and each part had unique flavor. Presentation of the food is not exactly stellar, but seeing as it is primarily a take out restaurant it didn't really bother me any. Taste is good, and that is what matters.  Price is self-obvious, but the prices are low. Not only that, but the portions are huge even for most places. When you factor in the portion at that price it becomes almost ridiculous how good of a deal that you get for your money. I have no idea how they make money, especially because I see them using grub-hub and Uber eats. After those places take their cut I can't imagine their profit margin being too high. If you are a fan of local places then definitely call them directly to help out local businesses (pretty sure they will still deliver for phone orders). Of course, the convenience of those sites are useful for us users, but personally I will take a little time to help out local places.  One slight negative is that it is a smaller place. It doesn't look like it was really built to have many people dine in. It is more of a take-out place, but they do have a few chairs and tables if your group is smaller. Atmosphere is simple, but it probably part of why they can keep their prices reasonable. However, very clean.  Overall experience was that it was great, and I look forward to eating it all the time. Good price, Good food, Good service.",
