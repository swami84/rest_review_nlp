I  enjoyed the rice and plantain so much that I could not finish the green beans. The prices are great,  all things considered, I  have paid more for a sandwich and soda in NYC.

We have been to many \"Caribbean /Jamaican\" restaurants / food trucks in NYC and this place is definitely above the average. Chicken roti and jerk chicken was pretty good, jerk shrimp was just alright. Non of the items was spicy. You can ask for a special jerk sauce on the side that is similar to what you would get in Jamaica's jerk cafes. But even the sauce is americanized to cater to people who can't handle spices. Again food was good for NYC, but don't expect it to be authentic like in Jamaica.",

My waitress was very pleasant and juggled several tables in as smooth and professional a manner as I've ever seen.  The menu is packed with an assortment of both Caribbean and southern-style selections, including jerk chicken, oxtails, brown-stewed chicken and a variety of fish. There is also yams, rice & peas, mac & cheese, collard greens, etc.  My brown-stewed chicken was quite delicious and the yams were equally as enjoyable. The mac & cheese noodles were a bit overcooked, but did have good flavor. The prices were reasonable and the portions were adequate.  I'm rarely in this part of Manhattan, but if I were to return, Freda's would be on my list for dining. I recommend it!",

Eleanor, Freda's daughter, suggested the calaloo (sp?) and I chose the mac n' cheese. Yum and yum! Good jerk chicken roti, yet for me it's Oxtail that will keep me going uptown.",

The lady serving was polite and friendly which is why I gave this 1 star. They don't have fried dumpling on the menu and no patties. Big miss for a Jamaican restaurant, in addition to this I had to ask for 3 different dishes before settling for oxtail because they didn't have what was on the menu. A real real shame.
