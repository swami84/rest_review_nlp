I couldn\u2019t complain because I chose it after reading some reviews. But the man at the counter, who we later found out was the owner, was extremely friendly and they had SO many options on their menu. I love Thai food and I immediately knew what I wanted. The food was just amazing! We had great conversation with the owner and we tried to convince him to open up a new branch in Queens, because he\u2019d definitely put the rest of the guys on Hillside out of business. He also gave us a complimentary fried ice cream when he found out it was our anniversary. I never got the opportunity to go back but I suddenly had a craving for Thai food and realized I never gave a review. I can\u2019t wait to visit again!",

And I ordered an extra one for today - they both went right in the garbage. I will be contacting Grubhub for a refund because that was absolutely disgusting. I couldn't leave a review yesterday because I was getting nauseous every time I thought about it! Also, the delivery usually only takes about a half hour. They gave me an estimate of an hour or so. As soon as it hit the hour I received a call from the driver. Somehow he was using navigation, was only about 5 blocks away yet he couldn't find me. Or follow simple instructions to stay on the road he was on, drive 5 blocks until he reached a tall building. I live in a high rise building on a main service road. I'm the only building on this road. There are HUGE numbers with the building address right in front and it took him quite some time to find me. The only good thing I have to say about this experience is that I am disabled and many times the drivers don't want to come up to buildings because it isn't easy to park. However when we spoke on the phone I reminded him that my receipt stated that I was disabled and to please come up. He did not complain and he came right up to my door. I will take the chance and order from here again but if I ever find another hair in my food I will be calling the BBB, 311, and any and all agencies that regulate the restaurant business.",

At this point I would order anything on the menu and I can't wait to explore. Great Job!! As far as the Pad Thai goes, it wasn't typical. That doesn't mean it wasn't good. It seems as though many Chinese spots have it on their menu nowadays. If you want a more typical flavor, head in that direction. I enjoyed the refreshing change.",

The soup and salad was good and the vegetable dumplings and shumai were especially great. I would definitely recommend that the pad thai recipe be improved upon.",

The lemongrass soup will sparkle your taste buds, really good soup,chicken cherry tomatoes. It is red in color because they put spices in it that gives it tons of flavor. I love their spring rolls, their shrimps with a fish sauce mix, their drunken noodles, their fried rice is so delicious. Their summer rolls is great, however I never had summer rolls served hot...so I request them cold..with their homemade peanut sauce. Really good. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a unique taste of authentic Thai Cuisine, like their restaurant name. :)",

I asked for mild and it was still spicier than the usual kind of mild that I get from other thai places. there was a lot of chicken in the dish, however, which made up for that bit. we also got pineapple fried rice and that was bomb af. lots of pineapple and nuts. the rice was cooked perfect. I'd come back just for that. thai iced coffee was not strong enough, feels kind of watered down. overall the food was great for the value. the pad thai could improve with the spice, otherwise it feels a bit more of an acquired taste.",

The most horrible was the sticky rice overheated in the microwave because it was frozen. When I tried to eat it, it was very hard and dry like plastic in the middle. Furthermore, it was served cold and I guess it was someone else\u2019s portion that was not sold so their gave it to me. Even my coconut water, it was the kind with large pieces of coconut that I usually buy frozen but they also overheated to melt it so it was warm. My last chance to satisfy my hunger was the papaya salad that we should call carrot salad because it was a lot of carrots. It did not look fresh as if it was made several days ago, not crunchy and definitely not good. The only think that was not fantastic but acceptable was the drunkle noodles. I will NEVER NEVER come back to waste my money there again!!!",

Heard about it through word of mouth from some of friends and they claimed it was good, I saw a vegan part to the menu and decided to give it a try.  The food was bland, somewhat mediocre, tasteless, not spicy (I chose medium spice), and it wasn't nourishing or satisfying. Just seemed like slightly more expensive chinese food. The woman taking my order on the phone was obviously new. At the end of my order I give her my address and made sure to spell out my street name, then she tells me theres a $5 delivery charge, which I heard was based on distance and I'm only two neighborhoods (1.5 miles) away. I accepted it. Then she calls me back to confirm my street name. I confirm again and ask if everything is alright, in which she assured things were fine. Ten minutes later the delivery driver calls me asking to confirm my street name, in which I do. After he hangs up I call the store and speaking to the same woman I ask if there was a mistake on the delivery fee. She keeps saying no, rushing me off the phone, she keeps interrupting me by saying bye and she's inserting these sarcastic remarks as I'm trying to make sure of the situation. The food arrives an hour after ordering and the driver declares that there was a mistake in the delivery fee as the receipt reflects her mistake.  I'm going to learn from this mistake, next time I eat from a restaurant for the first time, I'm going to visit the place first. The food wasn't really worth the inconvenience.",

Though a bit more modest than Ceetay (in Mott Haven), Thai No. 1 still has a cozy, and rustic interior. Thai No. 1 offers traditional favorites and then some. I was excited to see that the menu has not only vegetarian options, but an entire Vegan section. When in doubt, the soba noodle soup is a safe and delicious choice. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The owner treated us to free birthday cake during our first visit! The prices are very reasonable.",
