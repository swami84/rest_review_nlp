The atmosphere of the place is really very nice and it'll be great to see it develop more and more character from being in the neighbourhood overtime. The service was awesome, the waiter was helpful and friendly from the beginning and even offered some free dessert and I don't usually like churros but these were so great. I would suggest that they make adjustments to their quantities on making it the portions a bit more, especially for the rice and beans which were also great. Will be going here again.",

The food photos posted to their social media account showed their approach to Latin fusion food.  My dining companion and I paid San Blas a visit for lunch last Friday. At first, the restaurant was nearly empty, but later filled to near capacity. There was only one person taking orders and manning the phone/counter, but there was never much of a wait and she was attentive.  Both my companion and I ordered the Dominican bowl and we decided to split an order of the yuca fries. My companion asked for sparkling water, but they didn\u2019t have any in stock. We were also informed that they were waiting for their liquor license, so we can\u2019t yet add them to the happy hour list.  The taste of the food was hit and miss. The bowl\u2019s fried chicken chunks were bland. The bowl as a whole lacked flavor. Thankfully the yuca fries, which were the best part of the meal, came with a mayonnaise-based sauce, which I used to add flavor to the bowl. My companion mentioned our disappointment to the waitress/hostess and she reminded us that this was a \u201csoft opening\u201d and they\u2019re basically still in an adjustment phase. Fair enough.  I won\u2019t return right away, but I\u2019ll give them a second chance in a couple of months.",

The arepitas de yuca were incredible! The staff is very friendly and they have a great passion for food, art, and music. I\u2019m hoping to return to try their lunch and menu and their brunch menu on the weekends.",
