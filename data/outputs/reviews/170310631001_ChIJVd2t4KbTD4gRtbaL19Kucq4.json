For me, the sauces and taste of the dishes had more authenticity than the average thai restaurant.  The place is small and I came here on a Saturday, and it was completely empty. However, given its size Im sure it fills up pretty quickly. They do take reservations. I would recommend calling in advance on the day you are going there since they have been closed a couple of times when I went. Also, when on Broadway, turn west onto Barry, they are the 3rd building down on the right.  the service was good- not too much english spoken, but efficient and helpful. The cook makes good",

I paid to have extra seafood in my Tom Yum soup, the soup your restaurant is named after, and it came with almost none. I called back and spoke to a very nice woman who took my name and number and said I could come in another day and have my meal replaced. I called today to do so and the owner said that he wanted me to bring in the crab Rangoon from two nights ago! The woman I spoke to never asked such a thing. He would barely let me speak and said he didn't care and that he has other customers so he doesn't care about me. I would think twice about eating here. I never will again.",
