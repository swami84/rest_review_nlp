        "caption": "My husband and I went to Kumiko last night, Saturday, February 15, 2020 at 8:00 p.m. For the restaurant's review, when you walk in, we sat on the right hand side, against the wall, second table away from the bar.  This was, hands down, the worst service experience I think I have ever had in Chicago (where I am from). We 100% went to this place knowing that it's the cocktail part of Kikko. However, when we spoke to someone on the phone earlier in the day, she explained that Kumiko has a separate food menu whereby you can also do your own omakase. When we sat down, the server came over to us and immediately began speaking to us in a condescending manner that was, off-the-bat, off putting. The way he  explained what we were able to eat there was extremely aggressive to the point where I felt I had to interrupt him to explain that we have been all over the world to omakase restaurants, including Jiro, to give him the idea that we didn't appreciate the arrogant tone. He proceeded to make inappropriate comments to us like, \"You can have drinks, but not too many, because my goal is to not lose our liquor license.\"  When he walked away, I still felt as though he did not explain what Kumiko's omakase menu entailed. Therefore, my husband and I decided to just order whatever individual items we wanted from the menu. The server came back over to our table, and at the same time, the man to my husband's left waved the server over to his table as well. Considering the server approached our table first, the man to my husband's left waited patiently (very nice) to be taken care of next. My husband asked the server if he was ready to which he responded yes, so he, therefore, started listing off numerous items for our order. About 4 items in, the server literally put his open palm hand up to my husband's face and said, \"Hold on.\" He walked around my husband's back to the man to my husband's left and goes, \"What can I get for you? Would you like to order a drink?\" He actually stopped my husband in the middle of his order to take someone else's order that he deemed to be more important. We were disgusted and shocked that that just happened. When this server returned, I told him nevermind, and we just wanted our two drinks we ordered. My husband and I immediately decided that we wanted to get the hell out of there, drink our drinks, and go get food at a more reputable spot in West Loop (to which we did). When the server asked us, again, if we still wanted to place a food order, I told him no and that we were going to eat somewhere else. He asked us where, and then proceeded to tell us how to get there.  I actually have no idea how someone like this could be working at a place that is supposed to be associated with a Michelin rating. My husband and I are not frugal when it comes to eating out and eating good food. We were well aware that ordering off that menu was going to be a few hundred dollars, and we were fine with it until we were completed disrespected like nothing we have ever seen before. I actually felt like this was a Julia Roberts moment because we walked out and spent our money at another well known sushi spot in West Loop. My point of this review is not to get anything comped as we will never step foot in this place ever again. I just hope that this review brings attention to whatever management team Kumiko has so that they can take appropriate actions to make sure this never happens to anyone again. I have told this story about the server's hand in my husband's face numerous times since last night, and everyone's mouths drop when they hear about it.  To the management, if you want to speak further, please contact me directly.",

Bernard was our \u201chost\u201d because there are no mere servers at Kumiko. And the welcome we got from him and the rest of the team was simply amazing. He took the time to thoroughly explain all the drink options and delve into more detail of our choices. The expertly mixed drinks from the bartender were fantastic, as well as the snacks they offer, so you don\u2019t get too sauced. There are several small food bite items that you simply must try. The staff will help guide you with your tastes and what would go best. When we were ready to leave, the Kumiko team, and I must emphasize team, since they all  worked so seamlessly, must have timed this out as well, since our coats were ready and waiting for us by the door, in the hostess\u2019s hands.  If you\u2019re looking for a great little night out with someone special, or even flying solo but have a serious interest and palette for the unique, visit Kumiko. You will not forget it.

Impeccable service, insanely delicious, creative cocktails, tiny bites of delectable delicacies, a pen flashlight to read the menu.. I enjoyed every second. My husband & I went for my birthday & wanted to try everything! Needless to say we'll be back as often as possible! The hostess greeted us in the unique & beautiful space with a hot sip of green tea  & proceeded to take our winter coats. It was a special touch with the tea. For drinks we had, Walk Softly, Seamless, Triptych, Hidden Truth & the mezcal cocktail which the name escapes me. We also had the Niigata Sake Flight. By far Hidden Truth is the best cocktail with it's savory notes of chili oil & togarashi & citrus tang bite in the sip. Unforgettable. For food we enjoyed the, Nigiri, Sashimi, Oyster, Prawn & Shiitake Steam Buns. (Several of the latter two!) It's my new favorite thing in Chicago. Not even bar or restaurant. Just, thing. Can't wait to try Kikko next!",

Here goes nothing...  My friend and I were traveling to Chicago in mid-December when Kumiko popped up in my last-minute frenzy of searching for can't miss cocktails bars in the city. If you need more than just my word for how amazing Kumiko is, it made Bon Appetit's Hot 50 list and landed on Time Magazine's world's greatest places list for 2019.  My friend and I *love* Japanese cuisine and cocktails (so much so that we've gone to many cocktail bars across Japan), so we desperately wanted to make it to Kumiko while in Chicago. However, we too late to make a reservation for 2 online. I emailed the restaurant to explain our situation and we were encouraged to try walking in around 5:00/5:30 p.m. to get a spot at the bar. We were in luck because we got there at 5:30 p.m. and we only have to wait 8 minutes (yes, it was that precise of an estimate) to get a spot. It was a Wednesday night when we went though, so if you attempt this on a Friday you might not be as lucky. While we waited, we were treated to a lovely cup of green tea in the waiting area by one of the hostesses.  The Kumiko space itself is gorgeous. As we were ushered into our spots at the bar, it was like you were transported to straight to a high-end cocktail bar in Tokyo. Beyond the beauty of the serene and other-worldly space, the service and cocktail program are outstanding. Julia Momose's cocktail program is something really special. You've probably tasted or heard of Japanese whiskey, but have you tried Japanese shochu, umeshu, or gin? All of this is possible at Kumiko. Our bartender for the evening, Sammy, was super personable, friendly, helpful at directing us towards the right drinks when we were in-between two beverages. We had a genuinely fun evening chatting with Sammy at the bar and we wished we didn't have dinner reservations to run off to after. My favorite drink of the night was the Hidden Truth which was made with lemongrass shochu, lemon, togarashi syrup, and chili oil. If I could drink this every day throughout winter I would. The heat from the chili oil was divine. My next favorite was Sunshine Follows which has gin, sake, chrysanthemum honey, lemon, and pink peppercorn. It was crisp, bright, and refreshing.  You're looking at roughly $20 a cocktail and I had no regrets. If I lived in Chicago, I would make the effort to come here multiple times a year. In my wildest dreams, I would love to be a regular. Ultimately, whether you're traveling through Chicago, or a local, you should absolutely make it a point to grab drinks at Kumiko. The next time I'm in town there is no question in my mind that I'll be returning for more drinks, and to try out their food menu.",

He had the perfect balance of talking to us and letting us be. When I dropped my phone he came from behind the bar to hand it to me before I could reach down and grab it. There wasn't a drop of water on his work station and everything he used was carefully put back into its place.  This is zen as a bar and you can't miss it.",

We arrived a few minutes after our reserved time, but our table was not ready either. The host suggests we either go to the bar (there was only one seat available) or go somewhere else and come back in 15 minutes (which is the strangest thing I'd ever heard of). We wait by the bar and a server pours us a couple glasses of water that sits at the window ledge. I feel awkward standing there in the small space as we feel as if we're staring at everyone seated. After about 15 minutes we are finally seated.  The menu reads from light to heavy as far as the beverage options, cocktails, flights, etc. Granted we were starving, I skip to to the back page where there are 10 bite options and a bite dessert. When I tell you it's a bite, I am telling you they are literally \"one bite\" except for the Katsu (4 pieces). When we alert them of my severe hot pepper allergy, I realize we might be headed to Portillo's afterwards. lol There are only able to accommodate me with about 4 of their dishes, since most already have peppers or a sauce with peppers already prepared. For $44, I was able to enjoy 4 \"one bites\" and a dessert we shared.  Come here for the JapaneseSake or Whiskey experience, not for the food. The notes were tasty enough, but nowhere near enough to be satisfied for dinner.  I had two \"one bites\" of nigiri (Shio koji-aged made with white sturgeon caviar). The fish was delicately tasty. Not worth the $20.  The sashimi of ora king salmon, torched lardo, sea grape and toasted genmai offered a texturally pleasing bite (2 bites here, whoa watch out lol), the salmon was rich in flavor and the genmai a welcoming crunch. I was able to have the steam bun with short rib without the sauce it comes with but the addition of pickled cucumber. Nicely cooked short rib, the buns were a little flat for my liking. The milk bread was a piece of soggy brioche toast, and the ice cream was mostly melty.  The Niigata Sake flight was the highlight, and for that reason I would come back. It's not their fault I didn't read the reviews to realize it was more of a bar. After all, I don't go to The Aviary to fill up. haha",

The food....steamed buns, prawns, sweetbreads, and short rib(Gyudon).  Every bite we took was amazing and every plate we gave back was empty.  It was just the right amount of great food, a great cocktail, great service, great ambience, and a beautiful date.

The menu is very detailed but has so many ingredients we didn\u2019t know that our server basically had to choose our drink for us, and we heard this happening all over the dining room. A glossary or more descriptions would help lots. The other reason ordering is so tough is the lighting- it is impossible to read the small lettering in the very, very dim light. They clearly know this b/c they have pen lights to offer, but they honestly don\u2019t help. The people around us were commenting on their own exact struggle.  Also Kumiko really doesn\u2019t seem to know what it is. If it\u2019s a cocktail bar, it shouldn\u2019t be set up like a restaurant. If it\u2019s a restaurant, there should be more substantial food choices. 2 more things - our server suggested a drink to me that was off menu, and it was fantastic, but it was also $27. Just tell me that before I order. And, finally, put a sign on your restaurant and a sign on the restroom. Your staff ends up having to work way too hard explaining and describing things that should be self-explanatory.",

The ambiance is hip yet relaxing, and the service is impeccable. Generally I sway towards a lot of moving parts with my tasting menu's and cocktails, but the appearance of simplicity at Kikko is on a whole new level. The cost is on the high end when compared to other Chicago tasting menus/pairings when you really break down the amount of food/beverage you actually receive, but luckily they have Kumiko upstairs to give you a little taste until the next time I can make it back to Kikko.",

You can make it a tasting menu if you order the entire thing, we ordered nearly everything. All very delicious. What stood out for me were the steam buns, the rib dish and the sushi you wrapped yourself. Delish!

The drinks, which are catered to each guest and vary by patron\u2019s taste and wishes (and ingredient seasonality) do not disappoint, and their flavors are accompanied with a deep knowledge of the history of their brewers/distillers/vintners and their respective origins. From glassware selection to the delightful smell and texture of the bathroom soap, everything at Kumiko is deliberate and delightful. And the Warm Capital Oysters are a flavor that will linger warmly and fondly in my memory \u2014 order a 1/2 dozen of these and thank me later.",

The ambiance is a sleek and simplistic design which makes for a nice clean, crisp atmosphere. Sometimes, less is more. The menu offerings are both standard house cocktails which are quite creative as well as a seasonal menu.  I think we ordered at least 1 drink from each menu.  I recommend this place for any occasion for any type of experience, e.g., pregame, endgame or your only destination. :p",

Also involved, of course, are Noah and Cara Sandoval from Oriole, which is almost around the corner.  Oriole earned its Michelin stars in a flash, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some impressive awards coming to Kumiko soon, too.  As at Oriole, your first challenge is to find the place! The unmarked door is at the corner. Your experience begins with a warm greeting and a welcoming beverage (herbal tea the night I was there) at the host stand. Then you are ushered into the intimate dining room with its limited table seating and eight spots at the bar.  The atmosphere is welcoming, refined, and calming, with Japanese influenced simplicity that immediately puts you at ease.  The focus is definitely on cocktails and spirits, with an emphasis on sochu and Japanese whisky. There are also some very interesting rums, and a whole world of aperitifs and exotica.  Patrick, my bartender, was a charming host, and it was a delight watching his meticulous preparation of each drink. The main cocktail list offers a wide range of styles, so I had no trouble finding the bitter and complex flavors I favor. Patrick also helped me choose selections to match the food I ordered.  Speaking of food, the offerings are currently limited to three types of small bites (oysters, prawns, and steam buns), an eggplant dip, and two entrees (loup de mer and short rib).  I started with two of the tempura prawns, which seemed pricey at $8 each, but when they were served I realized we were in Michelin territory. They looked like something you\u2019d find at Oriole, perfectly coated in a delicate tempura and artfully graced with yuzu, mint and edible flowers. Fabulous.  I also had the eggplant dip, which was nothing like I was expecting, but was also excellent. It was served in warm miso, and the primary flavor was of the fresh herbs\u2013especially mint\u2013topping it. The accompanying rice crackers were also wonderful.  My entree was the loup de mer, a delicate fish served with its crispy skin in place, and already sliced into manageable bites perfect for combining with the accompanying ponzu and bok choi. A crunchy mix of furikake (a mixture of dried fish, sesame seeds, and salt) added a great texture.  For dessert I had Japanese milk bread, which is essentially a caramelized French toast served with truffle flakes and ice cream. It was delicious.  The night I was there the omakase tasting was not available, so I wasn\u2019t able to try that, but I\u2019m just as glad I had a chance to explore on my own.  Because there are so many interesting spirits on offer, it\u2019s an ideal place for people who like their drinks neat. I particularly suggest you try the El Dorado 15 year rum aged in dry Madeira casks; it\u2019s a very complex treat.  The combination of great ambiance, perfect service, divine food, and meticulous mixology make Kumiko a winner, for sure.",

The atmosphere was simple yet purposeful, the staff was friendly, the drinks we're phenomenal.  My favorite was the moonrise daquari flight, but Seamless was tasty and booze forward which no one would ever complain about. We look forward to visiting again and trying other cocktails as well.",

However, after spending $300+ including tax and tip, I left feeling I could have received a similar or better experience elsewhere. I expected a customized experience, what I received was a boilerplate set of drinks based on my preference for bourbon. The waiters barely spoke louder than the ambient noise, didn't provide any background on the drinks being served, and kept having to refer to the notes to get the drinks correct.  Their take on an old fashioned was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I couldn't provide any other notable memory. I'd suggest go to the dining room, get the old fashioned and you'll have the same experience I did at a far lower cost.  Suggestions - provide more background and explanation on the drinks; I'm guessing many patrons aren't familiar with Japanese spirits. The omakase states there's \"food pairings\" with the drinks--these are more bites that pair well with the drinks. It is substantially less than a tasting menu. I would have scheduled this for pre-dinner drinks had I known otherwise.  I hoped a more personalized evening; I'd suggest instead go to the Milk Room at Chicago Athletic Association, similar cost but vastly better experience.",

I enjoyed both the warm note and moonrise daiquiri cocktails. The Japanese milk bread was to die for! Minus one star because I felt the seating arrangement could have been cozier and less \"parallel\", we were seated too close to our neighbors. Also while I enjoy great tasting cocktails, I also think presentation is important. It was pretty minimalistic, without that \"wow factor\" in the style drinks were served (comparing to the Aviary with quality drinks and similar prices- an average of $18/drink).",
