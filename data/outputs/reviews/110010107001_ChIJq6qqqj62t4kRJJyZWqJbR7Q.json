I admit, I had my doubts walking up to this tiny place, which we picked out by it being the only resyurant with folks sitting outside- every table full. We had the fried chicken waffle and the strawberry cheesecake waffle. Seriously the best waffles in texture, lightness, crispiness, taste, size, etc. Add in the special flavors and we were debating after we finished if we should share one more order. Highly recommend!

Options range between sweet and savory and I have been able to try waffles from both.  On the savoury side: the egg and cheese waffles sandwich is great, well prepared eggs and veggies nestled in a waffles that has a crispy exterior and airy interior. Another item in the menu you cant go wrong with is the grilled cheese to which you can add veggies.  On the sweeter side you have the perfectly prepared sweet waffles to which you can and should add a scope of ice cream and sweet drizzles. The classic PB and J sandwich is given a slight twist with the use of waffles as bread and after having it, that is now the only way I would enjoy it moving forward. Finally the star of the sweet menu is the cheesecake waffle, a large waffles covered in cheesecake pieces and batter accompanied by fresh strawberries and heaps of whipped cream.  Overall, the entire family has enjoyed going to this resturant. Constantly friendly service and great offerings.",

I waited in line for about 15 minutes before it was my turn to order. I wanted to try a little bit of each so I chose the fried chicken waffle, with a side of bacon and eggs.  The waffle is just as delicious as they say you really don't need syrup but I chose to use it a  nyways. This was probably one of the most light and airy Belgian waffles I have ever eaten in my life. The fried chicken was pretty good, not amazing but Definately good.  Even though it looks busy at typically doesn't take people very long to eat and the Warriors are out quick. Would definately go back I enjoyed chatting with the people who work there. My goal is to up my belgian waffle game after eating here.  They offer a discount for Military, Police, EMS, and Firefighters; I think this is a super cool way for a business to thank first responders and public servants.",

Instead of bread for your sandwhich Classics like the club, or salmon which normally get bread for the sandwich get the  waffle treatment. And that's just the savory The sweet waffles like \"The Works\" are supremely sweet and you have to be prepared for it.  To try both sweet and savory you are looking close to $20 for two items but I'm telling you you wont regret it. But they mentioned you can have a police/military discount, so I'm sure that can help. The line can be long though so unless you are prepared to wait up to 30 minutes to get a delectable waffle or waffle sandwhich, look somewhere else.  In short definitely recommend if you have never had something like this.",

The cabbage and tomato was fresh, but the turkey was simply cold cut and didn't add much flavor.  I think waffle sandwich is a novelty idea but that's all it is.

Customer Service: The staff looks cool, and they are nice, nothing wrong with the team  Food: We only ordered the waffles, so I can only attest to it. I have really high expectations for the place after looking at the \"About\" section of their website. However, I have never seen anything special or different from this place. The waffle looks to be prepared locally and then poured by the local staff, and wollah, Waffle comes out. Taste is just like what normal waffle tasted (yep, no butter or syrup). Maybe they are specially made with special ingredients, but it just didn't wow myself nor any of my diner mates.  Place: Cramped, small, and crowded. They have tables outside, but if it's raining, then you're out of luck. It's relatively clean but it's jam packed full of customers and there are 5 people in line, with me being the 6th and I am already outside their shop. That place is that small!  They are in great location, I like it, very easy to visit by foot or other means.  Price: For the serving size and for the taste compared to other food shops in the area, it's a little on the pricey side. I understand that it's DC but I paid about $8 for the Waffle Chicken and it doesn't even have a drink. Maybe it's a fair price, but I am not going back because I think the serving is too small/too little for the price, location and service that I got compared to other food shops around the area.",

Staff was very friendly and attentive. While we sat and ate, a few other tourist first-timers walked in. Each time the staff immediately greeted and explained the ordering process. Every time they ask if anything is gluten free and if the customer is military or law enforcement. All are thanked for coming.  2nd: The waffles are light and crispy...with the exception of the French toast which shouldn't be be crispy. My 7-year old devoured the entire Nutella both times. The first time I had sausage and egg which was nice but if I came back again I'd get chicken and waffles.  3rd: Don't go expecting seating indoors. We got seating but only room for 6, max 7 people.",

The entryway is on the SIDE of the building. I say that because people try to enter through the exit, which is on the front (street side). The patio is small; it seats about twenty at a time. People eat and go, so the wait to sit wasn't long. That said, I must add that the food was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  I had the lox, creamcheese, and capers waffle. It was a nice size portion that I couldn't finish in one sitting.  My children loved it so much; they are trying to make them at home. Watching the waffle maker was a treat.  Yes, he was handsome (lol). More importantly, the skill that went into making the light airy waffles was masterful. I was fascinated. The lady at the register was a real character- no nonsense in a fun way. She offered great suggestions and let me sample the gelato. I see why the lines stay long here. It was worth the wait.",

There are pros and cons to this place. First the cons. The waffles were dry, tasteless and thin. I got the bacon egg and cheese waffle sandwich. and it was interesting. the waffle was only good with the syrup, and if im honest it was hard to consume. when i opened up the container, the bacon was practically off of the sandwich, they were in such of a rush. the cheese and egg tasted fake, but it was decent. When i was watching the people make the waffles, they looked undercooked on the top and the waffle cookers looked dirty and unwashed. The containers didnt have any stickers or markers to identify what the sandwich was. waiting in like took a good 15 minutes, which wasnt a bad thing but it was inconvinient. The pros were the good coffee and quick food, but thats about it. pictures will follow",

It seemed like a long practiced, clean recipe, maybe a little bland.  I had the ham and swiss and it was thoroughly enjoyable.  Just like crepes there is a technique to making it eat as a mobile bite without greasing you, they got it.  Now, the bad hallmarks of a cr\u00eaperie.  Crepes are street food, when they tie themselves down in a cafe, they usually do crepes REALLY WELL and everything else, meh.  Wicked Waffle's iced coffee is beyond meh, it was nearly un-drinkable.  Hot brewed, grainy body, and bitter like divorce, just like divorce it may have been chock ful o nuts .  I didn't finish it, I wasn't offered a refund. I suggested they make cold brew, if they are going to do self serve with a weird ice bucket arrangement. Have a waffle, skip the iced coffee.",

Living near Atlanta, there is an abundance of chicken and waffle establishments, however, the availability in terms of walking distance and public transportation can make getting there somewhat of a hassle--unless you're willing to rough it through Atlanta traffic. A nice juxtaposition is the Metro in D.C.--providing excellent accessibility to a conveniently placed chicken and waffle joint; aptly named \"Wicked Waffle.\" Worried that we wouldn't make it in time, we were pleasantly surprised that they were open when we did arrive. Although the setup of the restaurant is somewhat eccentric, the staff and the food were beyond appealing. As the adjective insinuates, the \"Wicked\" describes \"Wicked Waffle's\" nontraditional approach to preparing Chicken and Waffles. There were a variety of off-the-wall menu items and my girlfriend and I were impressed by the quality within each of our differentiated choices. My initial thought was that I would need syrup or some other condiment to accent my order--however, as I delved into the dish, I quickly realized that the Chicken had been carefully glazed with a plethora of sweet and savory juices that accented the dish perfectly.  With all this said, \"Wicked Waffle\" will absolutely be on the agenda when we visit D.C. again.",

We all decided to order from this place. I went to pick up the food and there was no line. After looking over the menu for about a minute or two, I chose the chicken and waffles. The people working there look so miserable and unhappy. It's like the Happy Lady there is their aunt who forces her nieces to work there against their will. I was surprised to see pre-prepared waffles. I just knew I would be getting a warm, soft waffle with a nice tender of fried chicken on it. Instead, I got a cold pre-prepared waffle with a soggy, unidentifiable piece of chicken on top. I did not enjoy it at all.  Today, I ordered a grilled cheese waffle and again, got just that. I'm confused as to how the cheese got melted but the waffle is still hard and room-temperature. Gave them a second chance, won't be back.",

I ordered the Memphis Style pork waffle gluten free and the PB &J gluten free. I sure wish the menu would have indicated that the pork comes with barbecue sauce on it because I could've asked for my sandwich without it. The pork sandwich was so awkward to eat that I ended up taking the waffles off and eating the meat with a fork.  The PB&J was excellent. When I ordered the Pork sandwich gluten free, the cashier spent a few moments studying the menu as if she didn't believe me that it's one of the gluten free options. And of course, the one dish I was really hoping to find gluten free is not; fried chicken and waffles.",
