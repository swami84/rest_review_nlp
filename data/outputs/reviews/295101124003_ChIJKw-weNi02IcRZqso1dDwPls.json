When PokeDoke first opened, I had never heard of poke and was skeptical of fish in the Midwest, but a friend and I tried it and I they had me hook, line, and sinker.  The octopus is a great non-standard protein option and they have a wide variety of great toppings.  The dumpling and wonton sides are also great.  I have tried poke subsequently in many other cities and PokeDoke is still my #1.  One of the things I miss most about St. Louis!",

Today, I have officially found THE BEST poke bowl I've EVER had anywhere! I ordered the Reg. Build Your Own Bowl, Shrimp Chips and Bubble Tea (Green Tea w/Boba - yes, it was Matcha Green Tea\ud83d\ude0f). After building my bowl, it came out to about $15 (Reg $13) and I was hoping \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffdit was worth it because this meal was waaay more than I would usually spend on lunch. When I say the bowl was packed out, so fresh, accurate and delicious?!\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf72 I was struggling to finish it and I have a pretty healthy appetite. Of course you don't really want to save food like this for later so I did eventually finish it but I was beyond satisfied w/the taste, the freshness, the portion and the ease of ordering online. I've never had Shrimp Chips but I quickly realized these suckers are potentially addictive especially w/some Spicy Mayo (don't judge me\ud83d\ude12). The Bubble Tea was also really good and refreshing. I loved that the cup was perfectly sealed considering the pandemic. All in all, if you love sushi/fresh fish and you're in the CWE, go to PokeDoke for a healthy, fresh, satisfying lunch/dinner! You WILL NOT be sorry!!",

The younger kids had a small (non spicy)dish and loved eel sauce with mango, pineapple, cucumber, and carrots with their choices of protein scoops. Our family of six will have to make this a special occasion treat, given limited finances (and adding avocado seemed very overpriced). However, the cost was appropriate given the high quality of each dish.  Additionally, we ordered curbside during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the employees were terrific: dressed carefully with masks and gloves, distanced appropriately, while remaining positive verbally and nonverbally. I was impressed with their detail to preventative directives, while also practicing hospitality during a challenging time.",

I decided to give up on poke doke for a few weeks then chose to give it another go. I again ordered the same bowl I always get and once delivered had the completely wrong sauce on it. I was directed by one of the employees on the phone I had to contact postmates to fix the issue, however after submitting my concern through the website I was offered less than half the amount I spent on the order itself. Very unhappy with both services and out money on a restaurant i came to highly recommend. Bad service on poke doke and postmates.",

One girl was helping another customer and the other was cashing someone else out. So a gentleman came from the back. They don't have a kid's size but he immediately offered an additional bowl so I could split the bowl between my daughter and myself.We got a large noodle bowl with spicy tuna, ahi tuna, shrimp and octopus medium spicy. He passed us off to the first young lady who had a great attitude. Additional toppings of green onions, avocado, masago, seaweed salad, and crab topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. Then she passed us off to the last young lady who was also pleasant and helpful. The bowl was yummy, noodles are now my favorite base. The seafood options had a great taste and texture. My only not so great point was the Thai Boba Tea. The boba has a great taste and texture but the tea was pretty bland and not as creamy as i'm use to. But we will be back it was a great experience.",

The ingredients are always fresh and super tasty. The first time I went I had suggestions from the staff on things to add and my dish turned out super delicious! The second time I was more prepared and equally satisfied. If you love all things seafood, I recommend the Ahi Tuna, Spicy Tuna, Squid, and Shrimp. Just thinking about all of this makes me drool!! I think next time I will mix up my add-ins a little bit more. I also recommend adding masago, spicy mayo, eel sauce and some sesame seeds! If you\u2019re considering going to this place, go now!",

But ivr noticed recently that some of the fish tastes like it\u2019s been sitting out for maybe a bit too long (the salmon and tuna), they don\u2019t have the little fried garlic slivers anymore and done of the other classic toppings, and they skimp on portions & tell you it\u2019s an extra charge to get the same amount of ingredients that they used to put in your bowl. That being said, the spicy tuna and drizzle selections are the saving graces here. Otherwise, the competitor pok\u00e9 places (and yes, there are a few in STL now!) aren\u2019t too far of a drive.",

When as a first timer I asked \"what do you recommend, what are your favorite toppings?\", The response from the unenthusiastic employee was an eye roll accompanied by \"I dunno, you don't have to put anything in it\". I asked a couple more questions but I was feeling like I was just an annoyance to the employee. On The other hand, I did hear a different employee explain some things to the people behind me in line and her explaination was very clear and friendly so I know there is good customer service if you get the right person! I wasn't really impressed with my bowl but since it's create your own I really blame myself and lack of knowledge of the ingredients. I tried again after doing some research on poke and made myself a wonderfully delicious poke bowl and have eaten pokedoke many times since. However I have only used a food delivery service since the first time so I haven't had any more experience with the customer service.",

Excuse me, but my expectations weren't great, but in reaction I suddenly made five stars, because there wasn't enough rice, so I wouldn't have four stars, but to the total power of the shops I met in this place.

I was ordering lunch for my company with a larger order (~12 folks) and was worried about how complicated it might be, but I wanted to support a newer local STL business. I called and asked if doing a lunch order was possible, and Andrew and the whole team were so on top of everything. Everyone was super helpful and patient, and the logistics were explained perfectly. The food arrived early, the deliveryperson was just the best, and the food orders were even neatly labeled by name. I can't remember the last time I had such a perfectly flawless ordering experience. I'm actually getting a little emotional thinking about how stress-free this whole experience was. And, of course, most importantly, the food was on point. I'm so happy that poke is getting the love it deserves here, and PokeDoke does it so well. The value you get for the quantity and quality of a poke bowl is excellent, and there's also such a great range of toppings to choose from. (If you've never tried octopus, go for it. Also, seaweed salad as a topping is a must.) Do yourself a favor and next time you're in the CWE, stop by PokeDoke.",
