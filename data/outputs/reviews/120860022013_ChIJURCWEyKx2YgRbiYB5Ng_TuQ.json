Everything that we had was super fresh and flavorful. My niece, who is 6, even enjoyed everything! She went absolutely Gaga over the chocolate croissant! The chocolate inside tasted like brownie batter, the croissant was flaky and buttery, and it was topped with fresh, crushed hazelnuts. I had the egg sandwich on an everything bagel and I am legitimately obsessed!! The bagel was scooped, but still had enough of the delicious center left to enjoy it to it\u2019s full potential. The Pura Vida sauce that came on the side needs to be bottled and sold! I also had an iced cappuccino that I wanted to cherish every last drop because it was that incredible. The waiter was very kind and even helped me switch all of our stuff to a table with an umbrella because the sun came out after we already received everything and it was a little too hot for my liking. I will definitely be returning and cannot wait to try something else! Also, there is this delectable sent that the restaurant is filled with that is sold and I need it to be pumped through my house because it is exceptional!",

Came in Saturday for the first time and went back today Sunday. They make bomb sauce and their everything bagel egg avocado sandwich was so flavorful and super filling. (2) Although they do get super busy their service is on point. They do a great job training their staff and everyone is always attentive to make sure they\u2019ve done their best to make you happy. Even sitting outside you get great attentive staff. Which is rare in most places with inside and outside sitting. (3) today there was a miscommunication with my order but a gentleman (im guessing the manager) came outside to understand the situation and helped me out with awesome attitude. (4) The decorations and vibe are beautiful and unique - definitely an experience. Lastly (5) they know how to make coffee. Their machiatto delicious & their flat white is too. Kudos to the barista. I am super picky with my coffee and I appreciate and value well made coffee.  Of course the prices are not the most affordable but I think they are reasonable for their quality. Plus you are at the design district at the end of the day. Honestly think it\u2019s one of the best options thereI  will totally comeback and rant about it to my friends and family. All in all I totally recommend it.",

Helpful and friendly staff. Large portions that ended up being two meals for me. Pura Vida is now on my rotation of go to restaurants throughout the week.  Menu items ordered- Vegan Lentil Bowl- great flavor combinations with a good ratio of greens and grain. (I prefer a bowl with more veggies vs rice/quinoa and this was perfect). Adashah is naturally a bit dry but the dressing served on the side remediated the issue.  Garden Greens Salad with Chicken- imo the ideal salad. Wide variety of fresh tasty vegetables. Two dressing on the side for you to pick from.  Green Market Salad with Chicken- this salad is a tie with the garden greens. Well rounded flavors with lots of crunch from the apples and sunflower seeds. Honey lemon dressing is to die for.",
