Look the word up. The job you are doing is not worth $20.00 an hour and I don't care how many people you wait on. $2.13 is what your employers pay if you are making atleast minimum wage, but you have to turn in your tip. Which you don't.  This is my first time here and Im very disappointed. I will never tip if I'm demaded to.",

Let me assure you that none of these ingredients had been introduced to one another for more than two minutes before they were presented to me.  If this is truly your \"Mawmaw's\" gumbo, I have sad news. Your Mawmaw never loved you.

The etouffe was passable--if we were in Michigan. The jambalaya was straight from a box. A po'boy is on very specific bread. You won't find that bread here.

High energy staff will get you in the door and make sure you get taken care of with excellent service. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review was the Ribs and Red beans and rice, with the classic New Orleans baked bread were excellent but the chicken which was half my meal was like Jerky and nearly inedible. However I will deffinetly visit again because the rest of my party had nothing but great things with their food and I'd go back just to have a beer even in that high energy but Bourbon street chill vibe restaurant.",

I looked around more and seen them crawling everywhere on the bar side. Then I went to the food court to order take out. Big mistake ! I ordered two meals, the waitress brought me one container I asked her if that had both meals in it she said yes . I gave her $40.00 she never came with my change. I looked up on the club floor she was smoking weed with another waitress. I asked loudly where is my change. My good intentions was to make sure she received her tip. She came downstairs to run her mouth to the cashier who took the $40.00 complaining that our bill was $31.00 and that she thought she deserved a tip. So she was giving our tip back to us to make us happy. I politely asked her why she thought she didn't need to give our change back. Then I proceeded to tell her that my husband and I wanted to make sure she got her tip that's why we needed our change back. Then the little smarty pants said well why wouldn't I have gotten my tip. Very loudly I said \" ITS New ORLEANS !!\"  Well I told her to keep the tip. However when we got back to our Hotel there was only 1 order. We got taken by so many ways here. I have never been treated so badly in NOLA or here. Normally this is our favorite place to go. However after this experience I won't be going back. They are ripping their customers off and plus I didn't take to kindly to all the dope smoke. Who ever ownes this establishment should start checking your your workers. There stealing from you.",

But beware of the receipt. We used a Groupon for $60 off food and they tried to add $60 into the subtotal before the taxes and gratuity for a large group (there were 5 of us by the way, 4 adults and a child) and then subtract the $60 twice after adding in the tax and gratuity. It took 10 mins of explaining to the manager and then 15 minutes of waiting for a corrected check for them to understand that they were trying to make us pay tax and tip on $60 of something that they didn't provide. I still don't think they understood because they did say multiple times that this is how they had been doing it.",

We were inside this place almost 30 minutes. We hadnt had any food or drinks since we left california. They were serving and talking to all the nice straight people but I think we were ignored for being lesbians honestly. If it was for age they could have asked for id since I'm almost 30. But since we were 2 feet from there faces and they ignored us no eye contact we didn't even exist to them. After nearly 30 minutes of being ignored to our faces we left. As soon as We did those 2 young bartenders boy and girl put phones away. We went to the funky pirate down the way and told them everything! They explained to me they hire the crappiest staff and they are always playing with phones rather than working. But they agreed my wife and I were purposely ignored after all our attempts. We spent $80 at the funky pirate between food delivery and drinks and tips. That couldve beenbourbon heats 80 bucks. I wouldn't suggest this place to any gay person.

She came back to check again what we ordered about 20 min after she originally got it. It took at least 40 min to get our food. Only 3 dishes, along with 1 appetizer were served with soda, no alcohol at all and our total came to $70! I was quite surprised. The gentleman at the door seating was very friendly though!",

They won't tell you and it's not listed anywhere that they charge an extra 15 percent gratituity to your bill even if you have four children with you to eat. They overcharged us 1. By splitting the drinks as if they came from the bar. We did not order any alcoholic beverages only 4 soft drinks and two waters. The drinks were 3.00 a piece.. The bar charged us 60.00! I approached a cashier in the bar to inquire about the charge. He was pleasant in the beginning but became argumentative when I asked to see a break down of the drink charges. He didn't comply.  The glasses were filthy. We didn't have any refills 2. They over charged us by adding one dish we didn't order and up charging the added seafood to a salad we didn't purchase.. The chicken nachos were 8.95 PLUS 4.99 to add barely any chicken to each plate! You can buy a whole fryer and add chicken to ten plates for that price! The cheese basically tasted old commodity soup cheese with  the consistency of cheese you pour from a cambells soup can! The gumbo tasted as if itd came from rouses freezer section. The bill was a whopping 120.00 but when they charged my card it was 145.00!!! I called the manager Amber to find out exactly why the charge was different and why the bill was so high. She argued with me, refused to comp the meal and an extra drink we didn't order, nor would refund the gratituity. Then argued with me over the refund of a 20.00 tip that was supposed to be only 2.00 as id left eight dollars on the table to make it 10.00! Then I asked to speak with the owner, she said she'd leave my name and number for him to call. He hasn't returned my call. She wouldn't give me her last name. I'm certain the Federal trade commission and better business bureau would be interested in the fact that this place is fraudulently price gouging consumers who enter into this establishment only to be severely overcharged without posted notices re excessive gratuity fees, charged for soft drinks from a separate place other than the restaurant itself and advertising chicken nachos for 8.95 the excessively overpricing customers to purchase a whole chicken just to have a few pieces of shredded meat. I'm sure the department of food and safety would have a shut down if they saw the workers handling food with bare hands while rats and roaches and crapping birds linger under and around the tables where customers are served to eat!! There's  no way in heck I'll go back to this place. i will be reporting them.",

I took two bites of the extremely bad jambalaya and a piece of bread and refused to eat anymore OR pay for it!  You can go anywhere else in New Orleans (my recommendation for food on Bourbon Street is A Court of Two Sisters for one of their pork po'boys!)  When I complained to the waiter about the jambalaya, all he could do was shrug.  He then spoke to his manager who comp'ed my entree.  (When it's delivered in a glop from a vat and tastes like it's from a box, and delivered within five minutes, it's not fresh.)  Then they charged us $20 for a fuzzy naval and a rum and coke!  When I asked about it (not yelling, just asking), she got very defensive and in a condescending voice and attitude \"Honey, this IS Bourbon Street and we charge more for our drinks.  Tell me where you can get a drink for less than that on Bourbon Street.\"  We have been to New Orleans many times so I said, \"two doors down at The Cats Meow has 3 for 1 drinks.\"  Her response?  \"Well, we're NOT The Cat's Meow.\"  By the time our conversation ended she was kissing our ass, wanted to comp me another drink and finally comp'ed my husband's meal.  This place thinks they can get away with crappy food to people who have never had decent food in New Orleans.  When I was trying to tell her that of course we would pay for it, she  responded by saying \"oh, you'll pay for it alright!\"  I felt very threatened.  When she finally calmed down, she kept saying \"I apologize\" and never \"I'm sorry\".  I really don't give a f**k if you've only had two hours of sleep in the past 48 hours.  Treat me like s**t and this is the type of review you're going to get.  Do not step foot in this place!",
