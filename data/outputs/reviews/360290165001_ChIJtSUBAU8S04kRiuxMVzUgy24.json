When it came time to pay we were presented with one bill because the server said it makes it easier for them. Easier for the servers but not us. It caused way to much confusion especially for our last guest who barely ate or drank anything. I don\u2019t understand when a party of 16 come into your restaurant to eat and drink and spend the money we paid can\u2019t be given what we asked for SEPARATE CHECKS....especially when I sat down specifically asked for separate checks and the server said yes no problem. Please listen to your customers we\u2019re the ones who keep you guys in business. My family enjoys getting together for lunch and dinner in downtown Buffalo Thank You  I will recommend your restaurant I always do",

We loved the vibe here and especially the music. Our waitress was Carol and she was very upbeat and made great suggestions. I wasn't planning on drinking but when I saw their cocktail menu a couple of the Martinis caught my eye. We ordered the catamaran cosmo and a dirty martini that featured not only olive juice but cherry pepper juice too. Also gorgonzola stuffed olives. We split the Kale salad with dried currants, parmesan, pine nuts and lemon vinaigrette. Delicious. I should have ordered my own. We split a pizza which was great but it was pretty salty. The bread they brought before dinner was wonderful. Crisp on the outside, soft and warm inside.",

We started with the arancini balls, it comes with 3 big balls. We shared between 2. Would also make a lovely main course. I then had a special dish - can't remember the proper name, but it's angel hair pasta, pecan pesto, grilled chicken, mozzarella pearls and tomatoes. Delicious.

The drinks were good and the bartender was very accommodating. We ordered and received our appetizer and entries in a timely fashion. All the food was very good, I ordered  arrabiata pasta and was very pleased with the flavor. However all 4 entries we ordered, all with different noodle types, were all far from al dente and bordered on over cooked. The most disappointing moment of the night was leaving and still being hungry after 2 drinks, bread an app and a (full) pasta. My fiancee ordered a half portion for here spaghetti and the plate had no more than four fork fulls of food. The only dish with an appropriate amount of food was ordered from the special.",

One of the wait staff, Lauren, was super helpful and desoaked the tables so we could sit outside. One of our party had crutches, so it was much bigger table and a couple of extra chairs. Super friendly and super professional. And the food! Wow! Absolutely delicious. We had two appetizers: the spicy sausage with sweet and hot peppers, the artichoke dish, a Panini, and one of the pasta dishes. Delicious beer and cocktails! Everything was absolutely done to perfection. The only picture that we could get was of the desert as it just came, because everything else was eaten so quickly since it was so fabulous. Lauren also accommodated us as the rain started pouring down and we moved under the outdoor bar/patio roof. This place is seriously a must-see and experience.",

In addition, once the staff realized there were some in our party getting a little antsy, they quickly swung into action. The owner even came out and GENEROUSLY ended up taking care of our table. It\u2019s clear, the establishment\u2019s main priority is their guests and that certainly went a long way with us.  Many thanks for handling a potentially sticky situation with grace and class.

I ordered the pizza from the bar, which is typical in most restaurants. The next part is amusing at best: When the pizza was ready, it was brought out to the bartenders, which was sat on their counter. There were two bartenders and a student who was learning. The bar was not busy. The pizza sat on the counter for so long that the student was using the pizza box as an rest for his left hand while the right hand was cutting cucumbers, lemons and limes. Needless to say, the pizza was cold when the bartender finally served the pizza. The pizza was burnt on the edges. I do not recommend this establishment.",

We were seated at a hightop table right across from the bar. My mom could hardly get up onto the chair.   And of course not the best place for a newborn baby.   It was a little rainy and dreary outside but that wasn't the issue.   Directly above our table was a large pipe that dripped with condensation onto the backs of my son, my daughter-in-law and my daughter.  Not too often you leave a restaurant soaking wet.  Not a good experience. Also we had to ask for a refill on the $3.00 iced tea and for Parmesan cheese on our meals. The owner and I emailed a few times; I asked for some type of compensation since our bill was  $165.30 but being that we live out of state nothing was ever done.",
