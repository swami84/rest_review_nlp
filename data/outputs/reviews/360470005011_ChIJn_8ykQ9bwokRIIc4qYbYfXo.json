I am from one of those families that chases three meals a day with stovetop espresso, it's woven into the meal experience, and often a source of comfort. It suffices to say that I go to a lot of cafes during the work week.  The difference here is that this cup resonates.  It's just damn good.  Encantada de tener un cafe verdaderamente autentico en el vecindario!  The cafe con leche is my go to, pro tip: splurge on the extra shot for the large.",
