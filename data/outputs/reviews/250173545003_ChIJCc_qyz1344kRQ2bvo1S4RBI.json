Definitely left this place with a fulfilling tummy  :)",

Also, the flavor was not real Pad Thai flavor, mix of sour and sweet. The most important thing for me is that the food materials are not fresh since you can tell that the tails of all shrimps have already became dark or even black and the meat was not tender at all.  However, there is one server there who was nice and friendly. She saw me only have few of bites and then leave that dish aside. She asked me to recook this dish with more sauce.  After recooking this dish, it tasted better and the cook there changed dried and overcooked small shrimps into bigger and tender ones. But those tails were still black, which made me no appetite.  Overall, I don\u2019t recommend this dish Pad Thai in that restaurant.  Dec. 27, 2019",

We weren't expecting too much in this part O town with regard to Korean fare but we were pleasantly surprised.  Tucked into a hole in a university strip mall where there are a few japanese and other Asian restaurants, this turned out to be a gem in the rough. I wouldn't compare it to nyc or LA KOREAN restaurants but in this part of town, they offer a pretty decent product.  Run by a cute mom and daughter (maybe?), it's got the homecooking feels. They had one of my favorite yukgaejang which a lot of places don't do anymore. Hubs had the soondubu.  Yukgaejang Compared to what I normally have in NYC/NJ this is still lacking a bit of ooomfh and heat but it still gets an A for effort because it tastes like home cooking!  Soondubu Hubs had this and he said it was decent. He's had better but he was also surprised it was better than he expected.  The service was certainly friendly and accommodating though! If I'm ever in this neck of the woods and craving Korean, I wouldn't hesitate to come here.",

I always buy their crab ragoon which is the best out of all the places I have been to. Their noodle dishes are great too but if you want to save money and stay satisfied with a yummy meal, go for the box deals.",
