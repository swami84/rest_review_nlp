The owner was soooooo understanding of my allergies and made the food with understanding. He was honest on him trying to keep his business open on his own throughout these harsh times serving and cooking in his own so a bit of a wait but completely worth it! The music and space outside is so calming and relaxing for a night out in a soul food mood. Thank you again!",

The cuisine is masterfully prepared by Chef Artist Thornton who takes his time to season, bake, or fry every dish to perfection.

Of course, the d\u00e9cor and  personality of the restaurant leave you wanting to stay well into the evening with revelry and laughs. I can't wait to eat here again. :)",

For a 15-25 seat restaurant, they only had 2 staff. The service was friendly, but it ends there. The food service was slow, and for such a restaurant, the execution was not great. It felt like the chef was very distracted, as he was managing the front and the back of the house. The other server was also frequently going out to buy stuff for the kitchen.  For drinks, they have a BYOB concept. That really means go get your drinks from the deli next door because we ain't serving any.  The food was also not great. Had fried chicken with Mac and cheese. The chicken came well brined and was juicy, but the chicken was very soft on the crust. You could taste the flavor in the batter, but the execution was not there. Not impressed especially when I'm going to consume that many calories.",

The bbq chicken wasn't even cooked all the way. I like my food well done. When I said something The cooker looked confused. I waited one hour for another plate.  The macaroni and cheese was bad. They put too much garlic in it, all I taste was garlic. They rushed when they cooked because not one thing on my plate was cooked all the way. Wonder who cooked the food because this place had it bad last night serving 25 to 30 people. They only thing I enjoyed was the salmon cakes that's why I gave one star.",

The turkey, salmon, greens, and deserts were prepared beyond perfection, presented well, and needed no added seasoning.  The owner and chef, Artist Thornton, is to food what miracles are to living \u2013 rare and highly appreciated.   The atmosphere, understated elegance, is warm and relaxing. While it is a BYOB, Spaha Soul can have your wine and spirits delivered when you arrive, or you can always bring your own.  Moreover, the prices are budget-friendly! Spaha Soul is a culinary mind, soul, and palette experience and well worth a top entry on your A-list of places to go in the City. Around the corner from the 125th street, drop in at 2294 Second Avenue and prepare to be pampered and awed.",

Artist (Chef & Owner) has specials that change often, which makes being a regular interesting as you never know what new things you might be trying to go along with your fried chicken (made to order).  I highly recommend the Prix Fix as you get the opportunity to try not only the traditional dishes, but will get to try the items on special. Did I mention Brunch, on Sat & Sun which includes Red Velvet pancakes!  I hope SpaHa will become that \"neighborhood place\" where you can take a date or your family; and still have a great time; especially if Artist has time to come out and say hello.",

I have been here at least 100 times.  Spaha Soul brings a great little restaurant to Pleasant Ave and East Harlem neighborhood. Owned by Artist T, he greets you with a hearty hello as you look around at the art (that rotates) and listen to the amazing music (often live) that creates a wonderful atmosphere.  Things you must know: 1) The food is fresh-orders daily and isn't made until you order it. 2) There is a huge variety on the menu for all food types:  'regular/traditional', vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, paleo, etc. 3) Sunday is brunch/limited menu only 4) RSVPs never hurt because the restaurant is small 5) BYOB BUT BUT if you want to drink based on what you order, there is a great place that delivers (and around the corner).  Artist hands you his phone with the number programmed in to place your personal wine order. 6)  Delivery is not guaranteed-choose pick-up or dine in 7) Not sure what you want to eat?  Talk it out with him! 8)  Can you say deal?  Ask what the nightly pre fixe is.  You will get 3-4 scrumptious courses for $35; yes that is not a typo! 9) cash only  The owner and proprietor, Artist, makes the food from the heart.  Definitely a gem for the area!",
