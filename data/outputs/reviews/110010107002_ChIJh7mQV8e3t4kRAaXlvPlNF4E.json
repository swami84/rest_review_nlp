Unfortunately for us we were 2nd class and not treated fairly. The reservation was books weeks in advance and I reached out a few days in advance to learn about the chef\u2019s table. The communication with the restaurant was difficult and a poor website to navigate - it was hard to truly plan this special occasion. I tried to call again the day before my reservation- no response. I luckily receive a call to confirm my reservation and I inquire about the chef table and the information was available and I was expecting a call back. However I didn\u2019t receive a call back so once we checked-in with  hostess, I inquired again. Immediately learning it was the individual I spoke with and said she\u2019ll provide the information shortly. We were told a table wasn\u2019t ready and we had no problem waiting. While waiting 20 minutes past our reservation we didn\u2019t receive any information. Once our table was available- we were sat on a table that was squeezed onto the terrace that didn\u2019t provide enough heat for a comfortable experience. The table was on a 45 degree angle and slightly impossible to eat a meal. Finally after learning that the chef menu is a variety of the standard menu it was ridiculous. It went from being flexible about not having our table ready to an overall sour experience. Anna happened to be proactive and professional and I appreciate her transparency- but it\u2019s not my responsibility as a guest. The experience is tarnished thus far and the concept and style of this restaurant should have executed this experience seamless. Instead we felt thrown into a last resort table - sat late on reservations... super frustrating when having a babysitter and short flexibility. Time should be respected and I know with Covid everything is adjusting but don\u2019t squeeze tables without considering all circumstances. We never ate.",

We had a reservation at Iron Gate for a Friday date night (dating anniversary) We waited about 15 minutes even with a reservation. Had the paw paw bear while waiting and loved it. The ambience was great and the seat heaters was a nice touch. They had one of the best negroni I\u2019ve had.  Our server recommended the tasting menu and we went with that. The tasting menu had nothing that was outstanding. We expected something unique or adventurous from a restaurant with a star. Our server explained the menu for the table to be an extraordinary affair so we were understandably disappointed when we were served under seasoned cabbage salad.  The regular menu was seafood heavy but that wasn\u2019t the case with the tasting menu. The only notable seafood was in a salad. We really expected more than one seafood appetizer and one meat in the main.  Furthermore, we were supposed to receive 5 mains according to the server but were only served 4. The mains included a kale Caesar salad, we\u2019re not the biggest fans of kale and expected more than that for a tasting menu.  Another great disappointment was the suggested wine pairing for our mains. We only wanted one glass and the server suggested a red which absolutely didn\u2019t go well with the food.  Lastly, the dessert was rice pudding. Again, why is it on the tasting menu of a restaurant with a star.  I am greatly disappointed to have spent $300+ on a dinner for 2 and received this selection of food. If we knew what the tasting menu was like we would have definitely gone ala crate .  I was really keen on trying their seafood and would love to go back and assume this was a one off experience but $300 for 2 is a substantial amount of money and to me it feels like a waste.",

We were like OK seems short, but that should be enough time. Our server comes by never gives us his name or appears interested at all in conversing with us. It took 30 minutes for our food to come. When it finally did we had 20 minutes left on our time to order anything else. Our server would keep passing right by us and never asked how our food was, never asked if we needed anything else. We would actively look around like we needed something and our table was right next to the kitchen, so it should have occurred to him to check in with us. but he didn't. A very nice gentleman saw that we were looking around and asked what we needed and he brought it. Our server never returned to our table except at the end to clear our table and bring our check (we kept thanking him, and he had no response). When we do get the check we see a 22% automatic gratuity (I think for COVID). In any other setting it would be fine, but our server did not come over more than once. So the fact that they put an automatic 22% for next to no service was annoying. I asked to speak to a manager and she did accommodate us . But my intention wasn't too get free stuff, it was to say that time of service is absolutely unacceptable for a place that is so highly regarded. Overall, the service alone would probably make me never go back.",

The tables were at least 6 ft apart on the patio where we sat, you must put your mask back on when a server comes to your table, which nobody should be opposed to. Our server was new, but very professional and patient. They knew it was our anniversary, and they brought out a free mini appetizer, a happy anniversary ice cream bar, and a couple flutes of prosecco.  This was our third anniversary dinner at Iron Gate, and they always go above and beyond. They even gave us a handwritten anniversary card. We were sad that the squid ink pasta and lobster dish is no longer on the menu, but we understand that covid has forced most restaurants to reduce their menu offerings.  The focaccia was excellent. The fritters were solid, although I would probably skip them next time. The romanesco wedge salad was very good, although a little small. My partner had the mushroom pasta, which she enjoyed very much, and which came with a ton of noodles. My gnocchi dish was also excellent, and also came with a ton of gnocchi. We had the apple Napoleon dessert, whose name eludes me, which was also very good. payment is completely contactless, so you scan a QR code on the receipt and pay through your phone. A 22% gratuity is automatically added right now, and the server pointed that out for us.  A very good experience as always.",

In fact they didn\u2019t even have a menu, we had to pull it up on our smartphone. They refused to make me an old fashioned, despite the fact that they have a full bar they would inly make one of their 5 or 6 specialty cocktails. They should also provide disposable paper menus for those that don\u2019t have (or want to use) their phone. They also didn\u2019t clean off dirty appetizer plates from the table before bringing the next course. They awkwardly wouldn\u2019t get within 6\u2019 of the table without everyone putting their masks on, even if we were in the middle of eating or drinking or talking, which really makes it hard to have a fun dinner. Really just a bad experience, and COVID is no excuse for any of this, I\u2019ve eaten at 25+ DC restaurants for sit-down dinners since COVID started, and none of them are doing the strange and uninviting measures that Iron Gate has implemented.",

I had to go to urgent care, as I was projectile vomiting and/or having diarrhea every 15-20 minutes.  I incurred hundreds of dollars worth of medical bills due to this visit to urgent care.  I was in horrible pain, and eventually began to vomit up just stomach acid.  Urgent care nurses had to inject some medicine into my bloodstream to tackle the nausea.  They told me the pills they would prescribe me wouldn\u2019t work fast enough.  I was weak and didn\u2019t return fully to normal until around a week later.  Lost 5 lbs in one night.  Iron Gate management was contacted, but never returned the voicemail.  I\u2019ve never sued anyone, but considering the hundreds of dollars in medical bills I\u2019ve incurred due to THEIR FAULT, and their lack of acknowledgement, something needs to be done so more patrons don\u2019t get food poisoning.  It looks like they might go out of business anyway.  They certainly deserve it.",

I had heard so many great things about the ambiance and food, so it was on my DC food bucket list. This place deserves a five star rating because Jenny was an absolutely wonderful server,  but the hostess ruined that chance. Having worked in a five star fine dining restaurant for several years, I expect to always receive a warm greeting and interaction with a host/hostess. When we arrived there were two other couples ahead of us waiting to be seated, so we patiently waited to the side as not to crowd the very small space. While the hostess seated the second couple, Jenny had come to the front and checked us in and assured we would be seated when the hostess got back. Two other couples arrived after us, and when the hostess returned she seemed to ignore our existence (felt as though it was due the fact we were the youngest couple present). The couple she began to try to help acknowledged we had arrived first, so the hostess then turned to my boyfriend and snappishly asked how she could help us. Taken aback by the attitude my boyfriend did not answer immediately, and then she turned back to the other couple. He then spoke up, and she seemed to struggle to find our reservation. Luckily, Jenny came back up to the host stand at that point and showed that she had already checked us in. Jenny asked her if she could show us to whatever table, and the hostess gave her attitude saying \"no, they can either sit on the patio or right here\" gesturing to the tables next to the host stand. I immediately said we would sit outside, and Jenny let us have our pick of a table. It was very obvious that I was quite annoyed at that point, and Jenny did everything she could to try to remedy what happened. Overall, the food was amazing, compliments to the kitchen, and our server was superb. I was very excited to try this restaurant. I just wish we had a better first impression, and maybe I would have enjoyed the first half of our dining experience more.",

It had a nice kick and the gnocchi was perfectly cooked. Desert was an orange tart ice cream and marshmallow , also amazing. This place had familiar flavors that were perfectly executed.

It\u2019s a great environment for a date night because of the low lighting and chill background music that isn\u2019t too loud, so you can have a nice conversation with a relaxing ambiance. I like this bar because they have a huge selection of top shelf liquor and their bartenders do a great job crafting any classic (e.g. a martini or old fashioned) to your liking, along with a nice selection of their own unique specialty cocktails. There\u2019s also a huge wine selection, and you can order any food from their restaurant while at the bar. I definitely want to go back for a dinner. The dining area is a patio (heated during the winter) that\u2019s covered with a beautiful trellis filled with vines. A very quaint and relaxing vibe.",

Second we ordered a shirley temple (7-up and cherry juice or grenadine) for my daughter but they served us some specialty version mocktail that was $8 without telling us which she didn't like and didn't drink and I didn't realize was $8 till I got the bill.",

Though the dessert \u201cbitter sweet\u201d chocolate torte did taste any sweet, only bittter to an unenjoyable level. The waitress was weird. I asked her what coffee they had, which they didn\u2019t have any special brewed coffee. But as I asked, she thought I didn\u2019t know how to order coffee and made me very embarrassed (she literally asked me where I came from). There stars only for the main course. All else worth 0.",

It was both our 1st time here but she found this place on social media and come to find out it was a top 10 brunch place in DC!.. well i just got to say it lived up to it!!! You can eat outside,  bar area or downstairs inside.  Very spacious,  clean, fancy looking and the throwback music was awesome! Reminiscing on every tune hahaha. The menu shocked me at 1st because it was so limited but talk about trying something new! Not your usual eggs n bacon spot lol. This place made you step out your comfort zone and it was well worth it! Everything was cooked to perfection! So many flavors in all the meals. Had my tastebuds going crazy!!! Compliments to KEVIN our waiter! For all the help and recommendations! Also Compliments to all the CHEFS!!! Keep up the good work.  My dream is to be a chef and this really inspired me more! They also gave me a bday dessert surprise. This place is just 5 stars! All day!! One of the best brunch spots in DC! For sure!! Thanks Iron Gate!",

Have you ever been to coastal Italy well this are the exact flavours recreated, brought so many flash backs. If you are looking for those authentic Italian coastal flavours this is the place.

We were a little early for our reservation, so we started at the bar. The cocktails were good, but not convinced they were priced appropriately for their relative simplicity. We were seated right around the time of our reservation. After being seated, I was told by our server that they no longer do a tasting menu, which was a bummer since that was the whole reason we came in the first place (and the website still said that they offer a tasting menu). Instead, we picked 7 dishes (tartare, bruschetta, carrots, haloumi, gnocchi, agnolotti, octopus) split between the two of us + 2 desserts (cherry variation & cheesecake). The gnocchi was a surprisingly large portion for tapas, which was a nice surprise. The octopus was overcooked and tough to chew. Both desserts were good, with the cheesecake being our favorite. I would suggest asking your server about the cherry variation because the menu description is horrible.",

The vibes are perfect for a date or catching up with a close friend. I have also come here with my parents and it's quiet enough that they enjoy it too (without feeling lame). Their house wine (Rizes) is amazing for red or white! It's $9 a glass and fantastic for a house wine.  It's their own private label actually and you can't find it at any of the owner's other restaurants. They don't have happy hour here- but their wine list is worth spending on. The waiters always have good pairing recommendations too.The food is amazing. Not going to lie, it's pricey - maybe even overpriced for the portion size. But the food is sooo tasty. You will need order quite a few plates to be full - I would say 6-8 dishes for 2 people. But the flavors are some of the best in DC. There are also options for vegetarians on the menu too! Iron gate is currently one of my favorite DC restaurants - although pricey it's a place I choose is worth the cost. Love the vibes here and will be back!",

Waiter and food deliverors were knowledgeable.  Chef took time out of his busy schedule to greet us and discuss courses.  Very interesting wine list.  Wine listed by region rather than grape varietal.  If you know Mediterranean  wines, you will find some great values on the wine list.  Had a great Crete white wine for under $85.  Was not chilled enough.  Waiter took time to chill for us.  Perfect.  When you drink nectar like this, one wine bottle lasts all evening.  Also great wine glasses.  Not great weather, so had to eat indoors.  Historical horse stable - apparently a restaurant on site at this location since 1845. Restaurant has a great outdoor PRIVATE patio in the back yard of a townhouse about 4 blocks from Dupont Circle.  Have to make a reservation because always filled to capacity.",

Iron Gate reminds me a lot of a restaurant you'd find in New York -- swanky, stylish and much bigger inside than it looks on the outside.  My friend and I came here for brunch and I loved where we were sat. It felt like we were in someone's ritzy house in the English countryside, complete with a fireplace.  The sesame-crusted feta was really phenomenal. I can't eat a ton of cheese all at once but was tempted to eat all of this since it was so tasty!  The deviled eggs were also quite good and by this point I was really full so I only ordered some vegetables but I'd definitely go back and try this place again, for brunch or for dinner. Sexy vibe that felt right at home.",

It left a really bad taste in my mouth. The worst part - I had talked up this place to my friend and she was incredibly put off by the experience.  I love in DC and this is one of my favorite places!

        "caption": "Normally not a reviewer but had to come on here to share our experience. I had a trip planned to DC and made reservations for 3 of us at Iron Gate over a month in advance. We saved it for our last night in town because I love Italian food and the restaurant looked like the best way to end our trip!  We arrived five minutes prior to our reservation time at 8:10 and the hostesses told us they could seat us closer to our reservation time. There isn\u2019t much room to stand and wait and the bar was full so it was a bit awkward and felt like we were in the way. Our reservation time came and went and we kept standing awkwardly and waiting. 20 minutes past our reservation the hostesses told us guests were taking a little longer on desert than expected and it would be just a bit longer. At 25 minutes past our reservation time a man seated at the bar approached the hostess stand to say he and his wife had been waiting to be seated 35 minutes past their reservation and asked what was going on, at which point we really grew impatient. We had an event to attend after dinner and at 30 minutes past our reservation we called and got a table at a nearby Italian restaurant, Floriana. We told the hostesses it wasn\u2019t going to work out tonight and left.  When we were seated at Floriana, my phone rang. The manager of Iron Gate called to apologize for the situation, which we thought was very nice. He ended the call by asking where we ended up dining.  Around 15 minutes after the call, the manager of Floriana approached our table and asked if we had come from Iron Gate. We said yes and he presented us with a bottle of wine - the manager from Iron Gate had walked the couple of blocks over to Floriana, told them what happened and asked to purchase wine to compliment our dinner at Floriana. We were astounded! This was truly above and beyond service from Iron Gate. We understand things happen but had been pretty frustrated when we left the restaurant. Thanks to the humility and kindness of the Iron Gate manager, though we never actually dined in, we have nothing but good feelings about Iron Gate and will definitely make it a point to return next time we\u2019re in DC. Thank you to both Iron Gate and Floriana for making it a great last night in town!",

I tried the ricotta gnocchi, which was light pillows of goodness (it came in a tomato sauce with sausage), the fire-roasted octopus was tender (it came with hummus) and the grilled shrimp on cornbread, which were good and unexpected tastes (shrimp tasted like cerviche and cornbread slices were fire-roasted but still moist!). They even offered a large porterhouse steak for those that want to stick to the basics. Wasn't that thrilled with the dessert selections.",

We decided to do the tasting, had no idea that meant it would take 30 minutes between courses and several hours for our dinner. We sat outside to enjoy the rustic evening experience but unfortunately people across from us decided to keep their phone flash lights on the whole time because it was too dark for them outside, (I'm not sure when they didn't just sit inside) the whole time the light was in my face at first I tried to ignore it thinking she would turn it off but the entire 2 hours I was stuck sitting there with a light in my eye. Very aggravating, we asked the manger to move us or ask the people across from us to turn off the flash light he did neither, very disappointing. Later after waiting an hour plus for my entree arrived cold and there was a piece of bone in my food (I'm vegetarian), the manager claimed a piece of their clay oven had chipped and fell in there it wasn't a bone. I'm not sure which is worse. Overall awful experience would not recommend, I felt so bad for my poor fiance he kept apologizing for picking that place.",

Really nice portion sizes.  Second time we had a large party on the garden patio and the food was good but service was missing.  We still had a nice time.  We considered having a large reception here but the communication has been poor so we're moving on to somewhere else.  I'd probably still go here for a romantic dinner with my other half - but not to throw a party.",

Iron Gate fit the bill perfectly; you've got a long, narrow spot with a decently sized, quaint bar and a few tables on either end.  The food is excellent-- it is pricey and portions are small but that's standard fare at this sort of establishment. The old fashioned that I had was very good and the wine selection is expansive. If you're looking for a place to take someone that's a bit more upscale and relaxed than your standard DC fare, Iron Gate is a solid bet (just be prepared to pay extra).",

While we had more than enough food, some of the small plates were a little pricey for their portion size, namely the eggplant dish and the deviled eggs. There is also a short in the wiring in the main dining room that causes the low hanging pendant lights to flicker. They were more than accommodating with moving us to a table without an overhead pendant. I would hope that's something that can be fixed in the near future as diners who arrived after us did not have the option to move. Aside from that everything was good. They ended our dinner with a complimentary anniversary dessert which was a nice way to end the meal.",
