(Keep in mind it was over 100 outside) The owner comes out from the back yelling at the man to leave his shop and to stop taking his pop, and he talked to him as if he was garbage. The man in front of me politely suggested that he allow the young man to hydrate himself because of the blazing heat outside. The owner was not understanding and insisted that he could not fill his cup in his business. I offered to pay for his drink, but the owner declined & said he had a business to run and that the young man was homeless anyways. I then explained that just because someone is homeless doesn't me they should be allowed to die of dehydration outside, and it still wasn't okay for him to speak to others in that manner. The shop owner allowed the man to leave, but gave me dirty looks for the entirety of the time that I was inside eating my food. Would never spend my money here and support this behavior again",

Here\u2019s a hint if you get into an argument every single day with your customers maybe trying to be polite and provide good customer service rather than being rude, it\u2019s really not a crazy concept.  New product advertised for 5.99? Nope The owner literally hand writes over menu prices to make .50 more on products. I\u2019ve never seen a franchise restaurant make up their own pricing scheme to make an extra .50 off their customers. $6 footlong of the day? Nope they handwrite $6.49 on their menu LOL.  They also charge for extra sauce which is something I\u2019ve never seen at any subway,  also won\u2019t let customers use their bathroom which is absurd.  My family is familiar with owning subways and I assure you this is the only subway that bends rules to make extra $. They are fortunate they are in a prime location and 24 hours otherwise they would be shutdown immediately. None of the meat, bread or veggies are even close to being fresh either.  Need a new owner and staff ASAP. My review is not the only one that addresses these inexcusable concerns.",
