It was a beautiful Saturday and we assumed the line outside was for walk-ins, so we told the security guard we made reservations, he looked at us and said get in line. We were early. We just assumed that they would call for reservations, so we went into the line, which was now around the corner. Mistake. It appears to us that they double or maybe triple booked reservations. Everyone on the line had reservations. Outdoor & Indoor dining was full. We found the hostess & canceled our reservations (which is a must because they have your card on file). We easily spend $300+ for a great steak dinner, but we immediately knew that this wasn\u2019t the caliber of dining that we\u2019re accustomed too. Won\u2019t be back.

I love that they keep the dishes all sanitized and saran wrapped until you sit down. The drinks were delicious (and strong).  The food was everything I knew it would be.  Absolutely lived up to the hype.  The salt and pepper calamari was amazing. The Rib eye was perfectly cooked, tender and so full of flavor.   The steak sauce was really good.  The Beijing chicken was really tasty.  And all the portions were  well worth the price points. The chicken satay was really good, but not as peanutty as satay should be, (delicious though) dumplings were awesome and the Red Velvet cake they gave us to celebrate out 30th anniversary was absolutely Devine.  \ud83d\ude0b  We will definitely be back.

The poor hostess told us we may not be seated until 45min to a hour. It was freezing if we didn't have a car we would of had to stand in the cold. We spoke to the Manger the extra table they had open was for a special client. He gave us a round of drinks on the house. We finally got seated at 9pm the waiter kept rushing us because they close by 10pm by time we got our food it was 9 30pm. Overall I won't go back. Horrible, the hostess was very sweet and tried his best",

We had the Ribeye and Filet Mignon with the garlic ginger mash and chicken fried rice. The steak cuts are a great size and cooked to perfection but it did not have much flavor for my liking. The garlic ginger mash was interesting to try but not my favorite because the ginger really comes through strong. The chicken fried rice was excellent. I loved it, very flavorful and the serving sizes were all for two people and the plating is really fun too it comes in like a bucket with with a handle and a serving spoon.  I had a Lychee Martini before our dinner and it was also very good. It came with a fresh lychee fruit and it was perfect.  Our waiter was nice and attentive also. We had reservations for 730 and arrived at 705pm and were seated by 715pm.",

The porkchops were tasteless and tuff. The best thing we ate were the lamb gyro dumplings and the vanilla bean cheesecake from the cheesecake factory. This restaurant is most definitely very expensive and very overrated. Did I mention it was cold!!",

Underwhelming.  If you are going to spend nearly $400 on a dinner for 2 at a steak house, the least you should expect is a sizzling hot steak when it arrives at your table.  Granted, a 48 ounce porterhouse is an impressive sight and a LOT OF MEAT.  It was clearly aged well and came out cooked medium rare as requested but it was not hot, it barely had finishing salt on it, the sided were lobster fried rice (more like essence of lobster) because it was very scant in terms of being anything other than just rice.  The thick cut bacon was a pretty decent side but it's hard to mess up bacon, and the lobster dumplings were divine not $400 divine but I digress.  The best part about the evening is that the staff is very well trained and treat their customers very special.  I wish they took that level of care when preparing their menu.  Certainly won't be back.",

Not sure if 25% occupancy was in effect here and I did see all tables were booked with diners 8-10+ ppl per table. Birthday, celebration and big gathering definately going on here. I had to wait outside bathroom because only 2 per bathroom and saw several ppl waiting for bathroom without masks. Where's the staff to enforce policy!

A slice of cake is 15$ , a drink is 20$ , Decent seating . The Lobster price varies from day to day . I think the food is Gluten free , so that could be why it's a little over priced .",

We had to rush the waiters for food and we frequently got interrupted by the waiters collecting used dishes. My friend was having his birthday and the waiters served the cake to the wrong person. We were paying 200 dollars each including 20% yips yet this was the service we got. This is just not acceptable.  WRT to the food, they are typical American Chinese food: oily, greasy, good for people who prefer heavy taste. Personally I don\u2019t think the courses we order from special event menu worth 200 dollars each person. They are more like typical dishes you can get at any American Chinese restaurant within a more sensible budget.  The only two things I liked are the jazz music and neon logo. Giving 1 star because it is very super priced + bad service.",

The food was too notch and the service was phenomenal, very attentive service didn't have to wait or ask for anything and the food was great, very nice porter house and you can't go wrong with any of the appetizers. The pac man dumplings were awesome as well as the lamb dumplings. Love the lobster fried rice. There's a definite club vibe there though had at least four or five security/bouncers there so safety is paramount at this place. This is a definite stop when I get back to NYC.",

The service was superb. Gave me an \"invite only\" vibe like we were celebrities. Once we were seated, I was already impressed by the table set up. Plexiglass to separate tables, plastic wrapped plates & utensils, and a contactless menu QR code. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. Very sexy, dimly lit, and music selection was dope. Jillian, our waitress, gave us the perfect rundown of what the restaurant had to offer since this was our first time here. For drinks, my girlfriend had the Red Velvet Froz\u00e9 and I had the Sour Diesel. It took us a while to decide what to order because everything looked so good. For our appetizers, we ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings, Lobster \"Spring Roll\" Dumplings, and the Chicken Satay. Our favorite dumpling was the Bacon Cheeseburger and I loved the peanut sauce that came with the Chicken Satay. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the 16oz Filet Mignon (grilled medium well), I ordered the Steamed North Atlantic Bass, and we both agreed on the Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice to share between us. My steamed bass was good, but I enjoyed my girl's steak more. Our waitress checked in to make sure we were good and was enjoying our meals. She ended up informing us that we were getting a new waiter because it was time for her shift to end and she was leaving. Which didn't bother us. We just hoped our new waiter would also be good. And he was good. I wasn't able to catch his name, but he still made sure our needs were met. When it was time for dessert, I informed our waiter that we were celebrating a birthday and asked him for the Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake. My girlfriend loved everything about this restaurant and it made me very happy that I made the choice to come here. Next time I'm here, I'll try the Pac Man Seafood Dumplings and the Peking Duck. With that being said, I really loved this restaurant and I would definitely come back again and go down their menu to try different meals.",

Great music and atmosphere and it seemed like everyone around us was celebrating something. The food was serviceable but not amazing, but we also ordered their Asian small plates. While the bao were solid (moist, flavorful), the duck tacos were dry and the lobster \u201cspring rolls\u201d were only warm and not crispy. The satay tasted nothing like satay - more like red colored chicken on a stick in a sauce vaguely reminiscent of peanuts. I have heard their steaks and more \u201cAmerican\u201d fare is much better so I would advise staying away from most of the Asian menu. However, overall I would definitely still recommend the atmosphere, service, overall experience.",

However, when they made us wait over an hour, we didn\u2019t even get an apology.  Our server brought the wrong wine bottle to our table\u2014twice. In the end, we didn\u2019t get the correct wine so we just gave up. I think an apology or a free glass of wine would have been nice.  I would not recommend.",

We were 30 minutes early so we did not mind waiting as they were just setting up their new outside seating.  Eventually other patrons showed up but no one was being seated as workers busily continue to set tables. Finally we notice other customer being seated. Employees just walked right passed us. More and more people were being seated. We tried to get the attention of everyone who passed and they all said they would tell someone. In the interim, other patrons were still being seated. I asked to speak to the manager, which was a different gentleman than before. I explained to him what was happening and ask him why we wasn't being seated. He did not address the problem at all. The food is meh for the prices ($20 cocktails $100 dinner per person). The cheeseburger dumplings is mushy and raw tasting. I also expect exceptional service. And I feel like my money wasn't good enough. My bf is extremely shy and would have been very uncomfortable if I would have insisted on leaving and this is the only reason I stayed. The experience made me feel terrible. Thanks, Stratis Morfogen. ALSO TO PASS OFF AS A BLACK OWNED RESTAURANT IS A MOCKERY OF THE MOVEMENT.",

For appetizers, we ordered an array of dumplings such as the famous French Onion Soup Dumplings, Pac Man Seafood, Pastrami, Lamb Gyro Dumplings, Philly Cheesesteak and the Lobster Spring Roll Dumplings. Also had the Chicken Satays as well. My faves were the French Onion Soup Dumplings, Lobster Spring Roll Dumplings and the Chicken Satays. Those satays are seriously crack! Highly recommend!  The main course consisted of the LSD - 2 types of Lobster (Farmer\u2019s Market Fresh Ginger & Garlic and Salt & Pepper), 48 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak and 7 lb. LI Peking Duck along with Chicken Fried Rice and Lobster Fried Rice. The lobster was extremely flavorful and fresh! I just couldn\u2019t stop eating! The steak was cooked to medium rare perfection. It was superb all on its own. No sauce needed. Lastly, the duck was so crispy and tender that it melted right in my mouth!  We didn\u2019t forget to make room for dessert so we ordered the Crispy Apple Wontons, Homemade Apple Crumb Cheesecake, Red Velvet Cake and Fresh Sorbet. The wontons reminded me of a souped up version of a McDonalds Apple Pie. It was killer bomb! And don\u2019t even get me started on the Red Velvet Cake! It was so moist and delicious that I didn\u2019t want to share with the rest of my guests \ud83d\ude07  I would definitely come back to try more dishes and of course the Peking Duck. Keep it up BCH!",

It\u2019s very easy to get to from either borough whether you decide to drive or take public transportation.  The decor is super chic. The restaurant is divided into sections which is great for large groups, Sunday family dinners, celebrities coming in for lunch, or just the girls hanging out getting drinks at the bar.  The staff and service here is top-notch. Honestly, everyone I walked by that worked here said hello (which sounds silly but that does not happen). A huge shout out to our server Jay. If you are there on a Sunday, hope and pray he\u2019s your server because he\u2019s the best.  At most restaurants there\u2019s usually 1 or 2 things they are known for, I think BC is known for several dishes that are absolutely delicious and not mention Instagram-worthy. One of the superstars here is what they call the LSD (of course not the drug) the Lobster-Steak-Duck combo. Order this if you are with a group of 5-7 people (it\u2019s a lot of food but it is something dreams are made of). The \u201cL\u201d: a SUPERB lightly fried lobster (I\u2019m a huge seafood lover and have always questioned frying a lobster but it is absolutely worth a try). The \u201cS\u201d: steak is a 45oz porterhouse that is dry aged for 45 days. If you think this is just chef-talk, do know this really makes a big difference. The steak was so juicy and delicious it ranks up there with some of the best steaks here in NYC and Vegas. And the \u201cD\u201d is a Peking Duck that had me in my feelings. It was so good. It\u2019s legit. It stands up with the best of crispy skinned duck slices you\u2019ll get in Flushing.  I can\u2019t forget to mention the dumplings. I\u2019m still a bit shocked I\u2019m questioning going back to a steakhouse for dumplings but I\u2019ve been telling all of my friends since I\u2019ve dined here that we have to go here for the Lamb Gyro dumpling and the French Onion Soup dumpling. I\u2019m still craving the lamb gyro dumpling honestly. At the first bite I was transformed back to The Halal Guys truck on 53rd Street. I think food should do that to you, it should create and take you back to good times.  On the list of other must-tries here: Pastrami Dumplings, Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings, the Pac Man Seafood Dumplings, the Lobster Fried-Rice, Peking Duck Tacos, and Chicken Satay sticks. Cocktail suggestions: Brooklyn Old Fashioned and the Lychee Martini. I\u2019m not a huge fan of Lychee Martinis but this one was creamy, not too sweet and packed a hell of a punch. Once dinner is over and you have enough room for dessert, go for the Red Velvet cake. I like red velvet cake so I\u2019m biased, but this cake from Brooklyn Chophouse will turn non red velvet believers into believers! It\u2019s that damn good. I\u2019m already trying to plan my next meal here once the city shutdown is over.",

For the main course, I had the pecking duck and the dry aged porter house- cooked to medium. It was my first time having pecking duck and I really enjoyed it especially since the chef carved the duck table side which was super nice to watch. Both dishes were extremely flavorful- so no sauce needed even though there was plenty provided. We also ordered their lobster and chicken fried rice along with some sides.  For dessert- we ordered an array of their daily selection including a fresh fruit sorbet flight, Apple crucheesecake, red velvet cake and apple wontons. The red velvet cake is an absolute must and that's coming from someone who usually doesn't care for red red velvet much.  Overall my expectations were exceeded and can't wait to come back especially for the dumplings! If you like dumplings and LSD(lobster steak and duck) this place is for you.",

Dinner started off with an array of dumplings - French onion soup (this was my fave), Pac Man Seafood, Steamed Edamame, The Pastrami and Philly Cheesesteak. I then tried the Chicken Satays, absolutely amazing, the peanut sauce took it over the top.  On to the main course - my party and I did Lobster two ways - fried and then in a ginger sauce, 55 Day Dried Aged Porterhouse (cooked medium) and the Li Peking Duck. The chef carved the duck table side! The main course came with sides of lobster and chicken fried rice, french fries and onion rings. I throughly enjoyed the main course - the lobsters were so flavorful, the steak was cooked to perfection and the duck skin was so crispy and tasty.  To top the night off we indulged in red velvet cake, apple wontons, cheesecake and a flight of sorbets.  I can\u2019t wait to return. The atmosphere was great, and the service was top notch. Shout out to our waiter Jay and all others that made my visit an excellent one.",

I also really enjoy the flavorful chicken lettuce wrap which I can literally eat that everyday along with the perfectly cooked 4lb lobster in a garlic and ginger sauce. I ended the meal on a sweet note with a scrumptious piece of chocolate cake!!  The decor inside is absolutely stunning, it\u2019s a mix of a vintage and contemporary feel. There is the classic mosaic tiles on the floor and old school dining chairs, while the neon lights give it a cool vibe.  The experience was even better because of the waiter Jay who was so attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and patient. Everything in the place is 5 star, check them out for yourself!!!",

A minute turned into 20mins and it was a different waiter.   The original waiter completely ignored our table but that was his lose because we tipped very well. The service is really lacking, waiters are inattentive, you constantly have to request them over.  We started with the reuben and cheesesteak dumplings, which were ok. The cheesesteak dumplings could have used a little more cheese.  For the entree we had the porterhouse with shrimp fried rice and broccoli with garlic.  The dinner was good minus the fried rice being mushy (I had better at a take out spot).  I would go back because there are other items on the menu that I would like to try but they really need to step their service up.",

I was hesitant at first since I stick to restaurants that offer halal options, but since they had an extensive seafood menu, I decided to give it a shot. Walking in I could tell the that the dining experience was going to be quite unique. My friends and I were greeted by a friendly host followed by the manager, Philippe, who was incredibly welcoming and sat us in the VIP section as our party was large (where past artists/celebrities have also dined). The ambience and decor was amazing, with many attentive and charming staff members catering to each of our specific needs.  We started off with a few veggie and seafood options which included: - Pac Man seafood dumpling (so cute) - Steamed Edamame dumpling - Scallion Pancakes - Lobster Wontons (yum)  Our main entrees included: - A three pound fried lobster - Green spinach shrimp - Sweet and sour jumbo shrimp (my favorite) - Bok choy + broccoli  All of the seafood items on the menu tasted super fresh and each dish bought out completely different flavors. I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or even just to impress your guests!",

Which was the Lobster , Steak and Duck as our main course. Also totally forgot to mention the dumplings and Chicken Satays. Chicken satays with that peanut sauce was mouth watering !! Literally the first time I had something like that. Overall truly an amazing experience!!  Classy spot, nice for dinner dates and good for large groups. Reservations are a must for this spot.  Service- Loved the fast service and also the chef coming out himself to cut the duck in front of us.  Shoutout to Instagram and the Food Bloggers on this dinner recommendation.",

My first bite were the french onion soup dumplings and I absolutely loved them. I'm pretty sure they ordered one order of each dumpling on the menu, so I can't quite which others were my absolute favorite, but I can also tell you I loved the truffle flavored dumplings! The pacman seafood dumplings were so adorable too. The chicken satay was a great addition to the table as well - I loved it. We ordered the salt and pepper lobster, fried lobster, the peking duck, and the dry-aged porter house for 2 with a side of lobster fried rice and regular rice.  The Peking duck was absolutely delicious. The chef cuts it right in front of your table. It was JUICY and amazing. The porterhouse was so juicy and tender as well. I brought the bone back for my pup and he was working on it for about 30 minutes himself, that's how good it was! I preferred the fried lobster over the salt and pepper, but then again, who doesn't love anything fried more than anything in this world haha.  Now the desserts were phenomenal. The chocolate cake was so rich, the red velvet was so smooth and the cherry on top were the crispy apple wontons.  On top of it all, our waiter was literally the best. Couldn't have asked for better service. And they were funny too. Super attentive and just so helpful with everything.  I honestly can't wait to come back again soon and try other items on the menu.",

We were greeted by a host and seeted right away.  Food - Dumplings were very unique and interesting something i have never tasted before. The steak was dry aged and by PatLaFrieda, it was cooked to perfection. Peking Duck was presented very well and it was my first time trying it. It was amazing.  Desserts - Apple Wontons with Ice Cream hit the spot.",

        "caption": "Whoa! If you want to WOW your guests, you should bring them here! The food is impressive! There are not many steakhouses serve unique dim sum and excellent Peking duck.  Brooklyn Chop House is a trendy steakhouse that serves Chinese food with an American twist near the Brooklyn Bridge. The service was stellar; the food was top notch; the seats were great and apparently, this is a spot for celebrities such as Ella Mai and Patrick Ewing!  This trendy restaurant has a comfy leather couch for the waiting area, a beautiful bar and comfy tables for large and small parties. Each table had a beautiful blooming white orchid.  There is a table in the back for celebrities. The regulars get their name on the wall behind the leather booth. It was so fun to sit at the same spot as Ella Mai and Gayle King!  These are my favorite bites out of the whole meal (for those of you that want novel amazing bites):  Chicken satays- crispy savory satays in a rich peanut sauce. Yes, we have all had chicken satays, but the flavors on this one was very addictive!  Bok choy- sauteed in garlic sauce, this was a perfect accompaniment to the dry aged Porterhouse.  Peking Duck- this was perfectly roasted crispy Peking Duck. It came with scallions, cucumbers, hoisin sauce and pancakes. The skin was so crisp and the duck had the right amount of fat. I loved that we were at a steakhouse and eating high quality Peking Duck! It was so amazing!  French Onion soup- this was so amazing! Sweet reduced onions with cheese in this French Onion Soup dumpling. I could have eaten all of them!  Salt and pepper lobster wontons- lobster in crispy fried wonton skin. This was genius! I wanted 20 of these! You can't go wrong with fried lobster!  48 oz 55 day aged Porterhouse for Two- this was perfectly cooked, medium rare and perfect consistency. I loved it! The beef was tender and so flavorful.  What we shared:  Bacon Cheeseburger shumai- savory beefy soft shumai. It was very good. The melted hot cheese was such a unique unexpected texture.  Steamed Edamame- this dumpling came in the sticky tapioca skin. It was refreshing to eat!  Pork ribs- these were soft savory and flavorful. It was so good.  Chicken fried rice- it was great fried rice. Fluffy rice with bits of eggs and chicken strips.  Salt and pepper fried lobster- I loved the tender lobster with the garlic chips. It was fried Cantonese style. Such a lovely surprise in a steakhouse in Manhattan.  Desserts:  Apple pie in fried wonton skins with vanilla ice cream- this was the best dessert! I loved the crunchy skins with sweet reduced apple filling. Such a great combination of textures and flavors!  Trio of Sorbet- Watermelon, Pear and Green apple. This was so refreshing and great end to the meal!  Apple crumb cheese cake- this was light and a different twist on apple crumb and cheese cake  Root beer float- this was ok.  What an amazing time! We had so much fun laughing, talking and enjoying the great food!  I would definitely return to enjoy the Peking duck, Lobster wontons, chicken Satays, and French Onion soup dumplings.",

        "caption": "**Reservations are very important here for dinner. If you walk in, there will be some waiting. And if you are late for your reservation it will end up pushing back your seating. Please be mindful of the hard working staff and management and rest assured that they want everyone to have the best experience possible. but within reason.  My party and I all arrived at different times. There is a seated waiting area that we were directed to.  The place is quite high end and there is apparently a space in the back that is only for celebrities and VIP. Their names adorn a wall engraved in gold plaques. There is a curtain as well for their privacy. Unfortunately no celebrities were in the building when I was dining in.  After all the members of my party arrived (six in total) we were seated fairly quickly. The staff was very courteous and attentive throughout our visit. At one point the owner Stratis came by the table to greet us, which was an unexpected surprise. He told us a little about his inspiration for the menu items and it was good to hear things from his perspective.  It was difficult to choose as everything sounded so good. We decided on some dishes that we all wanted to try.  Appetizers:  Pastrami dumplings were quite novel as I have not come across this combo before. One of my favorites.  Cheeseburger Shumai was another inventive combo. Very tasty.  Impossible Burger dumplings had the well known plant based filling that really looks like meat. Not bad at all!  Lamb dumplings are a rare menu item. The district flavor was apparent with each bite.  French Onion Soup Dumplings...aka Xiao Long Bao (XLB) When I first heard I had to make sure I heard correctly!  I know of no other restaurant in NY that has French Onion Soupy dumplings. XLB in general had become very popular but this taste profile was on another level.  Chicken Flat Noodles with Bean Sprouts aka chow fun. Those very familiar wide noodles but we made a slight modification and asked for no protein. It was definitely a great appetizer.  The Chicken Satay someone has mentioned were supposedly very good. The dish arrived and the skewers were covered in a very rich peanut  sauce. So good! It was most certainly one of the stars of the food show that night!  Sweet and Sour Eggplant. Crispy goodness as it as served fried (tempura style).  Eggplant is one of those vegetarian dishes that when prepared just right, is quite a treat.  Lobster Fried Rice!!  This disappeared very quickly to say the least.  Maine Lobster. Steamed and seasoned so deliciously. You have your choice of salt and pepper or a ginger and garlic seasoning.  32oz Dry Aged Tomahawk Steak (bone in)...this type of luxury steak was a nice treat for us. 30-35 says dry aged and gluten free. The meat came to the table cooked rare and was seasoned very well. This is one is their very popular items but of course one of the more pricier options.  7lb Peking Duck...a well known staple for those who travel to Chinatown of course. But we were quite a bit far from that area so it was a nice surprise to see on the menu.  The prep at BCH is no joke. The bird is slow roasted for approximately 45 minutes in the oven. Then it was brought to our table whole and then we got an extra privilege to see head Chef Li plate the pieces. I am normally not a very big fan of this duck style but it was very crispy and delicious. For anyone who has ever had Peking Duck, they will like this a lot.  Now onto dessert!  Hot Apple Wontons accompanied by ice cream. A very unique dessert akin to apple pie a la mode.  Peanuts butter cake - for anyone who is a fan of Reese's Butter Cups this is the one for you!  A slice of peanut butter heaven.  Sorbet - we were given the flavors or lychee, fuji apple and red grape!  It was a very refreshing dessert we all enjoyed.  The final piece of dessert that we tried was their Red Velvet cake. It was a perfectly cut slice that was so moist and delicious. There was some red velvet doubters at our table but once they tasted this cake they realized that they have been missing out.",

Now maybe selfishly, I figured the waiter would say\" our mistake we will only charge you for \"1\"\" . Nope he proceeded to tell me \"I will have to charge you for 2\" fair enough, but what are you going to do with the food that been sitting on my plate? Furthermore - I could have used a new plate without the reminiscence of the food you scraped off.  Also the wait is long there...some bread or chips would have been nice....",

I came here as a group of 6 and had the opportunity to sit in the VIP section even though we aren\u2019t celebrities lol. The service and food was impeccable. For a steak house they had plenty of seafood options. Given that I don\u2019t eat meat and typically lean toward fish or seafood, I was afraid there wouldn\u2019t be much for me to eat here but was pleasantly surprised by the variety they had to offer. The food was fresh and well prepared, I will be coming back soon and bringing other friends along to experience. So happy the group I was with picked this place!",

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly host. My party was waiting on me and as soon as I arrived we were immediately seated. The booth that was given to us was very private and gave my party and I a sense of exclusivity. The table was set eloquently. The drink menu consisted of very unique and delicious sounding cocktails. Unfortunately I stuck with an unsweetened iced tea, but I will definitely need to partake in my next visit. We were also given the option of of sparkling or tap water, which was very nice.  A round of apps were out in and we were ready to feast. The menu is eclectic and I was stoked to try all that was put on the table. This included several types of dumplings such as the Impossible cheeseburger dumplings, the regular cheeseburger dumplings, lamb dumplings and my favorite their pastrami dumplings. Although they were all delicious the pastrami dumplings had so much flavor, I would have been happy with that being my meal. But alas I indulged with my friends and had tried almost everything on our table. In addition to the dumplings we tried vegetable lettuce wraps, roasted vegetables, and the French onion soup dumplings. Every dish on that table was absolutely incredible!  We were given time to digest before our feast continued. The main event was what the restaurant calls the \"LSD\" which is made up of Lobster, Steak and Duck!  What a trio. The duck is a 7 pound slow roasted duck with the most flavorful crispy skin. It is then carved and plated table side and served with the ingredients to make Peking Duck pancakes. This was my ABSOLUTE favorite part of my whole meal. Our tomahawk steak was also seasoned and cooked to a perfect rare temp. Finally the steamed lobster completed it all. To accompany our main dishes, we had lobster fried rice and sweet and sour eggplant. Again everything was prepared beautifully.  We ended the night on a sweet note by sharing some fresh fruit sorbet, a slice of peanut butter pie, apple wontons and the most delicious red velvet cake I have ever had. Not usually a fan of red velvet, this cake was light, moist and not too sweet. The cream cheese frosting was anything but heavy.  Our service was impeccable. We were constantly being checked on and made sure everything was to our liking. Another thing I noticed was that the bathroom was pristine. To me this always earns major points for the restaurants I visit.  Pro tip: MAKE A RESERVATION. You cannot just walk in to this restaurant and expect to be seated. They make it a point to hold tables for pre-made reservations. You will be extremely happy you did! I promise you that! Can't wait to head back and try more of their unique menu items.",

Brooklyn Chop House has some of that but with an Asian flair. Their signature dumplings were interesting, we had the Philly Cheesesteak which was okay but no real sense or taste of a Philly Cheesesteak.  The dipping sauce was good though and provided flavor. I had the Sea Bass entree which was very average, my date had the sweet and sour chicken which was good but a little heavy on the sauce. I think on our next visit we would order sauce on the side and we'd have a hit. The real winner was the pork fried rice, it was outstanding, I would highly recommend to anyone. It was packed with flavor, and fresh vegetables, very top notch offering. The best part and what will most likely get us back sooner though was the dessert. The peanut butter cheesecake and the rum cake were on point and incredibly satisfying. I would seriously stop in for just desserts and coffee. The staff was very friendly and restaurant nicely decorated. Overall a very good feel and vibe, we will definitely return. Thanks for a great evening!",

Although, the service is never truly one of high standards it was by far the worst experience of them all. It was a 5pm reservation that was not seated until 5:20 because of late arrivals; totally on us. Initially we were the only party seated at a table and there were a few guests at the bar. One would expect some attentive service being the only table, but that was not the case. 1- The waiter did not take drink orders. I was confused and thought I missed something but my family confirmed. 2- We ordered our appetizers and entrees. After everyone placed their orders I asked for a hot cup of tea. 3- Appetizers came- no tea. I asked the server if he could check on my tea. His reply, \"I got you.\" 4- We sat at a table full of dirty dishes after finishing our appetizers and waiting for our entrees. 5- Now entrees are being served ON A TABLE FULL OF DIRTY DISHES NO ONE COLLECTED. The server actually placed my mom's entree on the table with half of her plate on the dirty plate and half on the table. I mean, seriously?! Did he not think to remove the plate to make space? Btw, still no tea. When asked, the server tells me it should be ready any minute. At this point I lost my cool. It's been over an hour and I've requested tea from two different people; the waiter and the server. They left my family and I at a table with dirty dishes and thought it was okay to serve our dinner on a dirty table. UNACCEPTABLE! The saving grace in this all was Shanice, a waitress that was serving another table and heard me yelling. She made sure I received my tea and the table was cleaned up for us. Our waiter then came to the table explaining he thought the busboy brought my tea. He would've known had he checked on our table. 5- No manager checked on our table to see what the commotion was about. 6- To add insult to injury when we received the bill the last 5 items were alcoholic beverages that we did not order. As a party of 9 gratuity is already included and that reflected in the service we received. Based on the treatment my family received today we will be staying away from BCH. We will be recommending our friends and other family members do the same. #MajorFail",

The atmosphere is lovely and super aesthetically pleasing, the staff is so friendly, gave great recommendations and were very accommodating.  Their specialty cocktails Smoked Boulevardier, This Side Of The Bridge, and Brooklyn Old Fashioned are to die for, we started out with their Bacon Cheeseburger and French Onion Soup dumplings and it's honestly hard to pick my favorite of the two- they both kept us coming back for more. Their Bacon Cheeseburger had some extreme cheesy goodness that I couldn't get enough of while their French Onion Soup was filled to the brim and we were so tempted to order more.  For our entree we split the 24oz Bone In Dry Aged Rib Eye that they paired with a delectable steak sauce. The steak literally MELTED in your mouth, I've never had a steak so delicious before. We had their sorbet to top it all off, it was so delightful it put me in a good mood for the rest of the day.",
