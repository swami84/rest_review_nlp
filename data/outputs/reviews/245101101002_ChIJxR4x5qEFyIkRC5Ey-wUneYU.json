Everything was dry, there was no sauce on any of the meats that I ordered. The food was cold (even though I had just picked it up) and the shrimp and fish seemed like they were boiled or steamed? Lightly heated up in the oven at best. They do not seem to have a deep fryer nor a grill which are so crucial to good tacos. Go to Papi's for much fresher tacos and go to Clavel if you want something authentic. Also, the guacamole had sunflower seeds in it? I hope they figure some things out but I definitely will not be back.",
