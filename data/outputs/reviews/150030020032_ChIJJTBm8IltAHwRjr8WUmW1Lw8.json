As others pointed out, the mariage of Hawaiian local food in a  French style cuisine with Japanese essence is very unique and I can\u2019t imagine to try anywhere else. Although the man who served us was nice and doing his job perfectly, but the way he rushed us serving food was too much. He brought us the first dish (which was oyster with shaved ice) before we have decided our first drink. Since the menu was shaved ice, by the time we got our glass, everything has melted by then.  Personally I also didn\u2019t understand why there was no sign of price of the course. We had to ask the waiter because there was no indication to any of our menu. I don\u2019t know how many people are comfortable ordering the course without knowing the price...",

Inside the store, the original old building is remodeled and the taste is quite good. The attraction here is that there are 8 counter seats in the open kitchen, so you can enjoy a feeling of live cooking.  On the day, the counter was full, so I stayed at the table. . .  Well, it is cooking, but the menu is only a prefix course. The content seems to change depending on the period, season, etc.  \u30fb Turnip soup You will have an espresso-style soup of the whipped calamari soup. The taste of the turnip spreads softly in the mouth and I feel the blessing of the earth.  \u00b7garlic shrimp Hawaii's garlic shrimp is a small shrimp with many shells, but this is a large shrimp and you can enjoy the texture of the shrimp The garlic flavor does not disturb the shrimp too much.  \u30fb Paris.Poke You will have Poki, which is made in tartar, with a special cream cheese base sauce.  \u30fb Black and white chicken The white is crispy with basil sauce, and the black is a truffle look! ? It looks like it is covered with Hawaiian cacao, and the cacao flavor is spread.  \u30fb Abalone, hamacqua mushroom risotto  \u30fb Maui Onion Soup A soup that is made using only the water of onions without using water. An item that tastes the blessings and sweetness of the Hawaiian sun.  \u30fb Big island beef A dish with brown butter sauce. It smells a little bit better if it is covered with salmon. The skill that a Japanese chef weaves.  Kilauea Lava Cake This specialty dessert.

I have not spent a lot of time in Honolulu, but this was the best food I've had there and some of the best food I've ever had. I thought the price for the tasting menu was very reasonable as the food was wonderful. It was great to watch the chefs work and prepare the food. Great experience. The servers were awesome as well, very knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy what they do, which is refreshing. Such a great place to escape the busy streets of Waikiki.

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) On the day, I wanted to go to a new place after a long absence \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 I made reservations and on that day, I noticed that affiliated store, I worried whether I should quit or not. (Goofy Cafe / aloha table / Heavenly Island etc)  I remembered that I was disappointed when I went to Heavenly Island because I was delicious in the past, goofy \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Anyway I had a bad impression even though it was a tourist opponent but I was worried but the owner's thought was also written in the advertisement So I challenged, but I was betrayed spectacularly. Recently in Hawaii, there seems to be an increasing number of styles that only offer one course meal, but even if we give out this amount after the other we finished eating, if this quality in Hawaii is satisfying, the shop that meets the stomach Even though there are many, it cost $ 80 and fee for dessert! This terrible quality and volume of dishes that will not add to your belly! Although the shop is aiming for fashion, it is nice to put a knife hook directly on the table without table cloth even though it is nice, but if cleanliness is allowed ... the knife hawk placed for each dish is the same position, even if it is dirty Insensitive customer service with no duty! If it is another Italian, you are wiping it with a style similar to high-end stores like putting paper sheets, French or steaks on white cloths? I do not know The Japanese are resistant to put it directly on the table! Because it is Hawaii, you can tell what you want to do, like coffee flavor, arranging Poki .... However, the chef also said that it was like training in Paris ... but anywhere in Paris? There is no delicacy which I trained in Europe! If you are a tourist, it may be fine on the spot, but the customer who is expecting it! Even tourists are stupid. Eating a course, a course that is not filled with a stomach? Why is the waiter out of the end of a desert course for her chips? The beginning to ask! After that, even though I think about it, I ordered dessert every time I cook, so it is troublesome and bad feeling but Thule decided to take only one dessert, so I ordered it. Among the dishes I came out, there was the most volume, and it changed. It is three stars. I think that I want you to study Halekulani \u00b7 Nanzan Guillogiro \u00b7 Cafe Miro course owner in the future. There are other things I want to say, but I am making fun of dishes. Just because the atmosphere of your shop is different, taste does not change much in any way! It is a group that will never go again. That is the shop where the evidence is not local. The lowest!

Hawaiian espresso.   Oh my, kind of like an espresso soup.  Yes,  interesting sounding, but works so well together.  (You have your choice of wine pairings,  or for us non- drinkers,  tea pairings, if you so choose.  The tea pairing was a very nice surprise.  Definitely worth the try.  Healthy and surprisingly very earthy and delicious. )  Next came garlic shrimp,  then the tako dish,  Opah, Maui onion soup,  chicken,  and last of the main courses,  the Big Island Beef dish \u2764.   I love, love the gastronomical adventure that they presented.   The menu changes every few months.   The service was like clockwork,  perfect.   The Chefs Table afforded us the view of every single dish prepared.  I can keep on gushing about the food,  but it will not do it justice.   So I will leave it be.  Oh, ...just one last thing.   The last tea pairing was a chocolate ( infused?) tea.  This,  I can just smell all day.   The scent was heavenly to say the least.   I don't even need to taste it and I'd be happy.  Overall, the farm to table concept definitely works here.",

        "caption": "We decided to come here because of a glowing review from the Honolulu Magazine. I called in to reserve 2 seats at the Chef's Table and was confirmed. However, when we showed up, we were led to a regular table and when questioned, we were told that the Chef's Table was already full. This was quite disappointing as we wanted to the chef in action. Confusingly, a few minutes later, we were taken back to the Chef's Table. There was no apology nor explanation.  The food here was good and I absolutely LOVED the tea pairings! I have never seen that offered before and my girlfriend and I are not huge alcohol drinkers. The teas offered were unique and refreshing. I was told that they were all made from local ingredients. It ranged from a kombucha tea to a hot chocolate tea! I very much enjoyed it and I hope to see more places offer tea pairings.  Our favorite dish from the prix fixe menu was the PARIS Poke. I am usually skeptical on alternate takes on poke, but this was absolutely incredible. The smoothest ahi poke seasoned just right with shoyu sits over a poached egg. It is all topped with a Big Island beef tartare. The flavors of the egg, ahi, and beef blend oh so well and the textures! The textures in one spoonful of that dish just amazing.  The only other issue we had was with the service. Not all of the dishes were explained to us. In the beginning, they were explained very well, but near the middle and the end we were just served the dish without much interaction from the servers or the chefs. At the chefs table, we were hoping for more of an interactive experience.  They validate 4 hours worth of parking at the Hyatt Centric located a short walk away. This was very appreciated as parking in Waikiki is always difficult and/or expensive",
