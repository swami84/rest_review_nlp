The Bad: Food and drinks were underwhelming: the crab dip and oysters Rockefeller we're composed of a similar uninspiring goop, and the cocktails were, stingy. The Ugly: specifically requested in advance a table away from the kitchen by a window (note: there were plenty of other tables before we were seated, so shame on me for not pointing this out on the spot). We were eventually seated at a small table in front of a service closet which contained food takeout materials and other supplies. The staff needed to access this supply closet three times in the first 10 minutes of us being seated. Accessing the closet required us to stand up and move our chairs and table ~ Giving the staff a helping hand on occasion is always appropriate. However, it was obvious that the staff was annoyed with this table's location, and was becoming increasingly annoyed with us for not moving our chairs and table fast enough. After approaching the maitre'd, explaining that this situation would be untenable for a sit-down meal, he (without a word), gestured to a new table that was a good fit. Bottom line: If you're headed to Loch Bar for the location you're going to the right spot ~ as for cuisine and hospitality, you'll need to manage your expectations.",

The fact that they usually have stone crab claws (when in season) is an added bonus.  Unfortunately, my most recent experience has probably hindered any future visits.  After driving all day from North Carolina, I entered the restaurant on Saturday, March 6th at around 3pm.  Assuming that we would be able to quickly get a table or bar stools, I went up to the person tending the host stand.  This is where the trip took a turn for the worse.  The man, wearing a dark suit with glasses, middle-aged, informed me that he had absolutely nothing available.  He did not offer to put me on a list, he simply turned me away, looking down his nose at me the entire time.  The place was very busy, unexpectedly.  I understand this can happen.  But, this man made no attempt to possibly accommodate us, even at a future time.  We were completely turned away.  I should also point out, we were dressed more than properly for the location.  My wife and I used to stay at the Four Seasons whenever we came to Fells Point / Inner harbor (3-4 times per year).  We have been staying at the Sagamore Pendry mostly now, but always make our way over to Loch Bar because we loved it so much.  We will not be coming here again, which is disappointing, considering the thousands of dollars I\u2019ve thrown through this place.  Thames Street Oyster Bar, right in the heart of Fells Point, and across the street from the Sagamore Pendry, will be our new Raw Bar destination in Baltimore.",

We ordered the crab cakes and the seabass.  The crab cakes were delicious. Lots of chunks of crab meat. The seabass however.... was SUPER SALTY. And me and my friend decided for a while whether we should complain and ask for a new one. And we decided yes. It's an expensive restaurant so we felt like we deserved to have it replaced with how much we paid for the food. The oysters were good as well and our cosmopolitan drinks.  When she told the our server that it was so salty, she was just staring at us.. Like awkward silence. No apology.... No \"do you want me to take it back and get you a new one?\".. nothing. So my friend finally broke the silence and said if we could have it switched.  I think our server was annoyed because we took so long to go over the menu and order because my friend and i were talking so much. But hey, it was our first time hanging out outside of work so we had a lot to talk about. We weren't rude though. We didnt do it on purpose. And we kept apologizing to her because we took a long time.  Server said yes and we got a new one and it was still SUPER SALTY. \ud83d\ude1e PLEASE if you have hypertension or heart failure,  do not order this!! I guess that's just how it is. We ended up not eating much of it.  Our experience got better because their Manager was very nice and talked to us.  I mean, the place is very beautiful. But it's an expensive restaurant and I expected more for our server. Ive been to Bygone which is owned by the same group and their customer service was top notch!",

Drink service was fairly prompt but no personality given from the staff (I'm from the industry as well so its always nice to feel a connection with your server)  Food service was interesting in terms of delivery (trickled out as the dishes were ready) Oddly the manager came over, not to wish me a happy birthday but to tell us the Loch Bar doesn't allow balloons? That would have been good information to have shared while I was booking the reservation so we were forced to hide them underneath our table- again just odd lol just an interesting birthday dinner and one not to be repeated at The Loch Bar- just not a fun vibe.",

Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to enjoy our time there because the restaurant took an hour bringing our entree\u2019s out. Another reservation (of another race) was seated AFTER us and received their drinks and entree\u2019s before us. My husband spoke to the manager, and he offered us \u201cFree\u201d drinks, stating \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to be this busy\u201d\u2014 I expressed that I wasn\u2019t interested in drinks and somehow the waitress STILL brings us drinks (which we declined again). It was going on 10:00pm with no plate in sight. By 10:15pm our food arrives and to say the least we were very unimpressed. Our waitress showed no sign of compassion or sympathy. In result, we boxed our food and desert. Honestly, I would\u2019ve left if it wasn\u2019t for my husband taking initiative for Valentine\u2019s Day date night. Ultimately, we felt disregarded by this restaurant and staff. Also, after doing research and speaking with peers this seems to be an ongoing experience for Black people. Tasteless and not worth it! Go upstairs and enjoy yourself at Bygone.",

The food and cocktails were absolutely delicious! Everything we ordered, from the crab dip to the steamed shrimps, to the oysters, scallops, crab cakes and filet mignon was well seasoned and tasty. The ambiance of the restaurant overlooking the baltimore harbor was great. You have the option of seating outdoors or dinning indoors. You also get great view of the water if you sit in one of the booths indoors. On Saturday night, they have a band playing music which adds to the overall vibe of the restaurant. The staff was pleasant. Our server, Raoul was very patient with us. He offered suggestions even without prompting and he was on point with his suggestions. In terms of pricing, the price is a little on the higher end. One of the cocktails (Sidecar with Hennessy) was about $26 which is on very steep. It is unclear if their pricing have to do with COVID because a lot of restaurants do charge an extra fee due to COVID restrictions and additional measures they have to take. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be returning in the near future.",

Our reservation was initially set for us to eat outside but the noise level drove us to go inside. So we sat at our second seating which was in a dingy corner right next to the door that had flies around us. Once again we asked to be seated somewhere else before we made the decision to leave. We sat at a more suitable area & by this time my mom and I were annoyed. It wasn\u2019t just us because the entire evening people were requesting to change their seating because the disorganization is prevalent there.  The bathroom was filthy, the floors were dirty & it smelled like feces, I didn\u2019t go to the bathroom, I just held it in.  The food was subpar. The steak that I wanted they didn\u2019t have anymore so I only ordered a drink. My mom ordered Chilean sea bass & it was probably a 6/10. The fries were very salty. The only thing good was the Brussel sprouts. On her meal she spent close to $90. And in all honesty it wasn\u2019t worth it.  Our waiter was very friendly & I would give him a 5 star \u2b50\ufe0f if i could.  Unfortunately we won\u2019t be coming back.",

It took forever for my waiter to bring my drink of water, once the food was delivered half of our party's order was missing and took repeatedly asking to get the rest. The table didn't have enough silverware for every guest so we had to ask the hostess who then asked another person who asked another person for a set of silverware. We still didn't have any after the meal was delivered and the waiter never returned to check on us so we had to just take it from the empty table across from us. The outside bar area looked pretty busy but the indoor area was pretty bare besides the live band so it made zero sense for the lack of attention we received. We all were very disappointed in our dining service on that night.",

Definitely fresh crab meat and no imitation crab used. Other than that honestly I wasn't very impressed by the food. I ate there three times during my stay in Baltimore Harbor. The ambiance it decent and restaurant was kind of small but cozy. The bathrooms definitely needs to be cleaned more often especially to accommodate the weekend crowd they bring in through tourism!",

The food and outdoor area itself were as expected, however, we were incredibly disappointed with our waiter.  He was rude, dismissive, and inattentive.  He also refused to consult the chef regarding a dietary restriction and responded with a request about the menu stating \"We can't do anything for you except a salad without cheese.\"  I highly doubt the chefs at this restaurant couldn't have prepared an entree or sides without dairy.  At times it took 30 minutes to see our waiter again.  This was supposed to be an important meal for our family and I would highly recommend people avoid this restaurant if you're looking for at least an average service experience.",

The sun set in our faces for ninety minutes like a heat lamp on late-lunch deli fries. The whole row of outdoor  tables were like that btw. In Florida they call those \"sunburn seats\". Even the waitress had a burn. They need to fix that customer comfort issue pronto, and then they might get the top shelf rating. Until then, \"eat inside\" is my early-evening recommendation.",

Great selection of very fresh oysters and cocktail with very interesting tastes. The soup crabs was amazing, get a bowl !! I had the swordfish that was not exceptional, friends had the lobster roll which was good. Great atmosphere with live band music sometimes !",

I got the attention of one of the bartenders and asked for a non-alcoholic beverage. To which he replied grumpily, \"so what is that? \" I repeated myself and asked for a non-alcoholic beverage, as I looked at him puzzled that he didn't know what a non-alcoholic beverage was. I even told him he could surprised me. The bartender sucks his teeth, rolls his eyes and mutters, not so softly, \"I mean I'm not clairvoyant! \" \ud83e\udd28 ImmediatelyI I'm thinking what kind of service is that!? I give you carte blanche to make anything non-alcoholic and you quip back that you're not clairvoyant?! Clearly this bartender wasn't CREATIVE either. He could have made anything. It was a shame because my friends all like to indulge in cocktails and was running a pretty nice tab. But his comment and treatment towards me made my friends close the tab and go someplace else. We won't be returning here for poor customer service from the bar. Very disappointed and embarrassed to take friends here from out of town just to be met with a rude bartender.",

It is perfectly sweet and also leaves you with a slight buzz (which is great because I feel like most frozen drinks lack alcohol even if they say it\u2019s there). On my most recent visit I tried the crab dip and it was delicious with a decent amount of lump crab meat (being a Marylander I am very critical of dishes that contain crab so I approve of this dish! Lol). I ordered the crab grilled cheese with a side salad drizzled with a vinaigrette. I loved it and would definitely order again. The salad was a nice fresh compliment to the heaviness of the sandwich. My aunt who accompanied me ordered the shrimp salad with fries and she enjoyed her food as well. Our visit was to celebrate my aunts birthday so they surprised us with mini shot glass sized versions of their frozen whiskey drink (which was less sweet than the frozen but also a good drink option), an oatmeal chocolate chip skillet cookie topped with a vanilla ice cream bar covered in a dark chocolate shell. I am not a chocolate chip fan but this cookie was very warm and yummy! Needless to say I highly recommend this restaurant and if you don\u2019t try anything else I mentioned please order the frose!  PS they also offer nice outdoor seating which I believe is heated during the colder months.",

Asparagus and Brussels sprouts  were great and perfectly  cooked (the sprouts had the right amount of crisp on the outer layer and this great subtle sweet to them from the glaze). The asparagus had garlic chips which I'm a big fan of. Had crab dip to start (done perfect Baltimore style), a few oysters (if you like briney, try the Loch or the Raspberry oysters), and finished it with an apple crisp that had the best bourbon carmel. We went after 9pm , so as to avoid a massive crowd, but the atmosphere was incredible with live music and the staff are very attentive and welcoming. Oh....if you likegood bourbon , like I do, check out the menu. It won't disappoint .",

I arrived before everyone else about 5:00 p.m.-ish, and this place was packed. I barely got a seat on the corner. The good thing about the bar area here is everyone's coming and going you just my have to wait but you will get a seat. It ended up being a total of 7 of us and we had a great time the bar menu (HH Menu) is pretty fantastic, but small portions. I found more relief in ordering from the regular menu. The beverage specials are on point! They're really good although I personally ordered the wrong drink.  Collectively as a group come we ordered Classic Caesar add Chicken, Arnold Palmer Crush, Bmore Lemon Stick Crush, 1/4 Peel & Eat Shrimp, Brussel Sprouts, Oysters Rockefeller, Frose, Scallop Carpaccio, Moules Frites and Bourbon Slushie.  Everything in my opinion was delicious. The only thing someone mentioned was the Oyster Rockefeller and muscles that wasn't too their liking but 2 other individuals volunteered to eat it and loved it. No one else had issue with them!  Zach was our bar person and he was fantastic. He was on the money with coming back to see when we needed stuff as well as make a show he expedited our individual bills, food containers and to go water cups so that we could leave promptly when it was time.  Another thing I like about this place besides the ambience, menu choices and clean environment is is the dress code. After 4:00 p.m. they have a posted a list of things you can not wear on their website and I really appreciate it. I to dress up when I go out and I like where everyone else does the same. It definitely puts a different spin on things and increases the caliber of this establishment visited.  Will I visit this place again... absolutely!",

Loch Bar is a NYC-ish designed environment. As for happy hour, what can be pricey at other times is quite reasonable in the immediate after-work hours. Now, on certain evenings this will lead to an influx of people looking for a bargain. And Loch Bar can get noisy. However, the beer list is quite decent, the happy hour wines exceptional (and that is as rare find), the oysters cold, plump and juicy and rest of the menu well-done. And the noise level will subside after the 6PM hour. Multiple servers behind the bar provide cordial and attentive service. If I lived/worked in Harbor East or Fells, this would be my permanent hangout. Preference over Pendry. If it's Happy Hour. Go enjoy. Other times, Loch Bar can be a wee-bit pricey",

I ordered the  Maryland crab cake, with this restaurant on the water and cost of it I expected the crab cakes to be over the moon delicious. But I was so sad. The one  cake had all crab with a very very small amount of fuller. The second crab cake did not even taste like crab. It tastes like a hush puppy. I was very disappointed. Ive had better crab cakes for half the cost. Plus i was so sad they dont have any sweet wine on all their alcohol wine list. We were celebrating so alcohol was on the list. Very sad. Plus it was so loud that I found it hard to talk with my husband  let alone give my order. Side note we found an ant on our table... Gross but we were done eating so not much we could do then.",

Today (Saturday) we decided we would go to the outside bar since it was sunny out. We usually see Sam, but today there was a guy working. We asked for a couple orange crushes and my brother asked for a draft beer. The bartender initially said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but then he switched it up and said going in and out would be \u201ctoo much work\u201d so my brother could not order a draft beer. REALLY? - we didn\u2019t let that get to us and he ordered a crush as well. From the time we sat down and when we finished our drinks, our bartender went inside at least 6 different times. While we were paying, we actually witnessed the bartender go inside and bring a froz\u00e9 out to a girl who was sitting next to us. Seriously?.. We asked for our check and decided to go inside to drink the draft beer my brother was craving and also ordered some oysters. Frustrated, I asked to speak to a manager on duty about my experience and he said \u201cthanks for your feedback but the froze is a different machine than the draft beers so we do allow those outside.\u201d WHAT? Lol. That\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. So you would rather inconvenience your PAYING customers and have them go inside if they want a draft beer than have your employee bring it out while he brings the froze out? That\u2019s logical. I will not be returning to this place when they don\u2019t take customer feedback seriously. They could care less to turn a bad experience into something positive, as long as they are making money - and trust me, this place isn\u2019t cheap. I work in customer service myself and the right answer from a GM should\u2019ve been \u201cI apologize for your poor experience, that is not what we strive for and feedback will be provided. How can we make this up to you?\u201d I expected more from The Atlas Group..  very disappointing",
