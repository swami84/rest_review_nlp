Id recommend looking at the menu in advance.  I\u2019d also recommend getting sushi there, though there are many equally delicious options available (pad Thai, sweet and sour chicken, many others)  because it\u2019s one of the better sushi spots in the city.

The lemonade iced tea was on point and everything went smoothly. The second time i came (within the week)i had ordered the genereal tsos shrimp and sushi. My partner ordered the shrimp Pad Thai. Food Was hot and they provide great containers for you to take home your leftovers in. Jenny was really sweet! They also have the best fried rice I ever had in my life. Which was crazy....and the leftovers reheat well. If your ever in town and your tired of old heat lamp panda express or getting carried at some of these carryouts stop by. The sushi specials are awesome and the atmosphere was welcoming. Its one of my favorite spots now. Hopefully you'll give it a try and it will  be one of yours.",

The drunken noodles are also very yummy but as a pad Thai enthusiast, it wins. Sushi is very fresh, made right there and they have the good ginger.

I was taken aback by the spiciness of my meal, but they did warn me with the flame symbols on the menu, so now I respect the flame symbol. My girlfriend and I WILL be back!",

Salmon sushi tasted fresh with generous portions, the Kung Pao chicken far exceeded expectations, and the fried noodles were also good. Came in soon before closing on a weeknight and still had friendly, quick service. Will definitely be returning.",
