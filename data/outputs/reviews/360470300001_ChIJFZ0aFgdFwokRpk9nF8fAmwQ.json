It is authentic and the beef soup is wonderful. The aroma it gives off makes you want more and the taste is so beefy. Service is to be expected as it's just 2 people working in the whole restaurant. The son that is in charge of the front and his mom that is making all the orders! So be nice as they are really friendly too. Thai Iced Tea is a must there. It's so good!",

The flavor profile is authentic and yummy, but some things I expected were not available, like basil and cilantro as a condiment for the Pho. There is also only one size for the soups.

Before we went in, the store door had said it was cash only and that it didn't accept any credit cards/debit cards so be aware you need actual funds to eat here.  Once inside, it has a few tables so it is quite small. There was one guy taking the orders but it was quick because it was just my boyfriend and I and another guy. We got our order pretty quickly after ordering and the aroma was delicious. The broth was good and the chicken wasn't too dry. Overall, I think this place was pretty good.

I absolutely love Vietnamese food, light, fresh ingredients and incredibly tasty, but many places here aren\u2019t that great. But, Little Saigon Pearl is absolutely delicious. They take a long time to prepare your food (that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s fresh!) and the shop is extremely cramped. Expect to spend some time here.  The bun xeo is super good, I believe I spelled it right. That\u2019s the Vietnamese crepe with bean sprouts in the center. You have a choice of chicken, shrimp, or squid and all three have tasted great. The batter is crisp and has a light coconut flavor. The sprouts are still crunchy, but don\u2019t have a raw flavor. Meat never is over cooked. Served with lettuce and, unfortunately, a super stingy helping of fish sauce (gimme more of this goodness, my biggest complaint). The grilled pork is always sooooo flavorful and tender, not dry like many other restaurants. The bun bo hue is nice and spicy, with a deep, rich broth. The mung (my favorite) has tons of veggies and toppings to give it a fresh crunch. Their spring rolls are also so homemade? None of that professional batter, rather almost a store bought wrap with a wonderful, meaty filling.  I love coming here for some homecooked Vietnamese. It\u2019s not expensive either, just don\u2019t expect to be in and out in this mom and pop shop.",

Good sized bowl of Pho (only one size) with a nice amount of protein of your choice. Sliced lemons were big and fresh.  Tasty Bahn Mi (had pork chop).

Banh Mi (Viet sandwich) was cold, meat was covered in ice. Bread not toasted and fillings was lacking. Cha Gio (egg roll), tasted like manufactued, bought frozen. Fish sauce provided was lacking, very tiny portion, only a few drops. Only provide two piece lettuces and one mint leaf for six Cua Gio. These lettuce and mint leaf are vital, crucial but lacking. Pho (beef noodle), beef broth base is good, you can taste the beef bone flavor in broth. But portion is very tiny, very tiny bowl for the price charged. Just one meatball, cut up into three pieces. Missing other traditional beef ingredients. Beef slice was just three. Only provided bean sprouts and not other crucial, traditional vegetable ingredients. No lemon. Their excuse was, no one knows how to eat proper viet food since the neighborhood is 99% non Vietnamese. But if they want to compete with the other Viet restaurant situated 50 ft away. Little Saigon Pearl needs to do better. The other Viet restaurant is doing better Viet representation, they are more authentic. I see great potential with LSP, but they needs to shape up or GTFO. I had far better Viet food in Rochester NY than this place. But at least, its made by actual Vietnamese, run by Vietnamese. Unlike the many fake Viet restaurants on 8th ave/Sunset Park. Again, there is great potential. Let's see if they change for the better. But if you know nothing about Viet food. Its not bad.",
