Everything else I've had here - three or four stars out of five. The other food I've had, (chicken and burgers) is all okay. Nothing to write home about. But it does pairs pretty well with the curly fries, which really brings everything up a notch.  Service - Two out of Five stars.  Always have a hard time placing my order. Sometimes I call to place an order and never get through. Okay, maybe it's busy?  Every time I'm in the restaurant though, I'm the only person in there. I know they probably aren't with a customer, why don't they answer?  Finally, I figured it out on a kind of late night a couple weeks ago. After numerous phone calls going unanswered. (About 7 calls over 30 minutes) I made it to the restaurant and placed my order in person.  After I was done the employee was making my food. (You might be able to imagine- I ordered the curly fries so they were simply waiting as they cooked in the fryer)  While they were waiting, the phone rang. I expected to see them ignore it. Or answer it. Instead, they simply picked it up and then immediately hung it up! Literally no greeting, or words uttered at all!  No wonder I can't ever get through with a phone call! If you're walking by and want some fries, or are sitting at home and can order online it's probably worth it. Not safe to order online when I'm driving across Allston though...  Will definitely keep eating curly fries.",

I got the Lonely Guy Dog, fresh squeezed lemonade, and the Poodle Fries & my boyfriend got the Junkyard Dog without tomato's. Overall experience was good. I didn't really care for my hot dog, but my boyfriend said his was really good. The poodle fries were also good but could have used more salt/seasoning. The best part of the experience was definitely the atmosphere & customer experience. The walls are covered with cute fitting decor and the employee there was patient & listened well to our customized order. Sometimes places get the order wrong if you make too many adjustmennts, but not this place. I would definitely go back and try some of their other options since they have so many! I recommend this place.",

I was dubious as my experience with veggie dogs has been less than ideal but I can confidently confirm that this small home strung hot dog shop has the best veggie dogs in the world.

We are both vegetarians, and they have a large handful of vegetarian options! The atmosphere is very family friendly, the d\u00e9cor is pretty awesome with a lot of old school photos of classic cars. Even the register counter has a car door for decoration! The restaurant is very clean and has a good amount of seating for how small this location is. There is little curb parking, so I recommend just taking the T or an uber to this location. The staff is very friendly and patient as I was indecisive in selecting my order. This place offers a lot more than just hotdogs, and I enjoyed my hotdogs so much I just might get more and try out their veggie burgers! I ordered the All American Veggie dog meal and it was so good. They have a good selection of fountain drinks, the fries were curly fries and crispy! The hot dog really spoke for itself, the size of the veggie dog was perfect for the bun and the toppings were not overloaded, but they were very generous on the amount. All for a great price! My guest and I shared the Freaken Hot Hotdog, it was super good. . . but needs come with a warning sign. That, or maybe my guest was right I\u2019m just \u201cweak.\u201d The hours here are awesome, come in for a late nigh bite.",

The owner (I assume) proceeded to scream at her behind the counter the ENTIRE time we were there, and as the only people there it was extraordinarily uncomfortable. It was a very small mistake, she accidentally gave us 2 meals instead of 4 regular hot dogs. We weren\u2019t mad at all, the owners reaction just had us feeling so bad for the waitress we wished we hadn\u2019t said anything. On top of that, the fries were cold and dry, and the hot dog isn\u2019t even cooked on a grill. It\u2019s cooked in one of those mini oven conveyor things you\u2019d expect to find in a college dining hall. My boyfriend and I were so perplexed by this he went to ask if they had a grill, and instead found out they cook their burgers with essentially a panini press. The interior is extremely cute and friendly, but the owner is beyond intense and the food is very disappointing.",

They do provide a sink for washing your hands! That alone is worth a whole star, and you'll freaking NEED that sink too, because when you DO try to eat the two large pieces of chicken placed haphazardly on a piece of bread, entire mound steaming with BBQ sauce, you'll be covered in all manners of edible preservatives. But, I went over to use the sink, and it was out of paper towels. So, that was my experience, and I write a ton of positive reviews go look at my profile, this place was awful. A colorful, well decorated package of some of the worst food I've ever had. In an effort to write something positive, the fries were alright.",
