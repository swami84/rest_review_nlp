Forget this place for dinner before an event - go across the street to Atlantic Social instead (5 star service and food there for pre show dinner).

        "caption": "Me & my wife went on Valentine's Day to 40/40 in Brooklyn for the Nas & Maxwell concert. I'll speak on the experience as a whole leading up to the concert, as we had reservations & we traveled from Ohio for this event.  We waited for 30 minutes outside of Barclays before we could enter the building. he employees said it was due to not having security there, which is odd considering the caliber of place this is supposed to be. Bear in mind, it was about 10 degrees outside in Brooklyn. After we were in, we had to wait another 15 minutes to be seated. I assume everything wasn't in place yet.  We were the 1st people there and we were sat towards the back of the room in these high chairs. We're not short people, but not over 6 ft either lol. We were treated to a buffet of different cuisines. Some were outstanding, like the short ribs, the sweet potato hash & the beef brisket. Others were not... such as the hamburgers which were only cooked medium & the deserts all tasted like they came from a box. We had 2 courses, and by that time it was time for the show. Even though it sounds not bad, our server was OK and made sure our needs were met.  For the amount that we paid, we expected a higher degree of standard. My wife eats at a variety restaurants all of the time that are 4 star, while I just like food. To both of us, this was mediocre. Even though it's a sports bar setting, on Valentine's Day, people really expect an A-Game even if the food is just a buffet. It was our first visit to New York state for the holiday, and we had way better food in Harlem that was like $6 a pound...2 days earlier that we still remembered. If this was a regular sports bar, I wouldn't mind it, but for the price there are more options that have better food AND trump the 40/40 in comparison with service and price.  The concert was great, btw! I really hope that these guys step up their game, it can be an outstanding restaurant if it lives up to its expectations for future events.",
