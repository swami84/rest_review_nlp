The large garden salad had tons of fresh leaves and but very little flavor. Maybe 3 tiny apple slices and a few pomegranate seeds.  The lettuce to \u201cother stuff\u201d ratio is way off.

We were greeted by the most kind host, who ensured we were not seated by a child (as we are a couple, looking to enjoy a date night in New Orleans), right on time with our reservation.  We then were lucky enough to be served by Lee, who was knowledgeable, hilarious & gracious throughout our meal. He paired our wine perfectly, clearly loving what he does, and made us feel like the only table in the restaurant. The floor manager Aaron floated around the tables, adjusting each cup or plate with care & didn\u2019t hesitate to ask where he could be of assistance (even though the night was already perfect). They were a dream, please trust me when I say these types of servers rarely exist anymore.  If we ever have the opportunity to visit another Doris restaurant around the world, we will 100% do so. Stop looking for somewhere to eat; you\u2019ve found the perfect dinner spot here!",

That was very nice of them. Drinks were delicious and the bartenders were all friendly. Our server, Aaron, is probably the best server I've ever had. He was inviting, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the entire menu. Listening to him describe different dishes made me want to try everything. Beef carpaccio was amazing. They had used some gastronomy to make \"balsamic spheres\" that you ate with the carpaccio. I ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it was perfectly cooked throughout the entire cut. Using the marrow to spread on the steak gave it amazing flavor. Courses were timed perfectly. I did not wait very long between courses and did not have multiple courses being served at the same time.  Cons: Near the end of our meal, an enormous cockroach appeared out of the wall and almost crawled in my wife's hair. Fortunately, the table next to us noticed it. The servers took care of it quickly and the manager came out to apologize and offered to move us tables, but we were almost done. I understand we are in Louisiana, but with how much we were paying for our meal, that was quite unappetizing and expected more than just changing tables. We ordered a dessert, specifically avoiding anything with peanuts or tree nuts because I have a severe allergy. Aaron recommended a modified dessert, but came back and told me that all desserts had come in contact with nuts at some point. Thankfully Aaron and the kitchen staff were watching out for me. Again, for as much as we were spending, we expected for there to be some kind of dessert I could get, especially since my allergy is very common. At the very least, there should have been a warning on the menu.  I really wanted to rate our experience a 5, but those last two things really put a damper on our evening. I hope those issues can be fixed for future customers and would be willing to give them another try the next time we're in town.",

Flavor was a bit bland, and the presentation was just okay. You can see in the photo that it\u2019s just a scallion placed on top of a slightly-above average steak, no side, with salt and pepper. I guess I was just expecting more for this price range. Service was also not so great. I ordered an espresso twice from two different servers and never actually got one until I asked the food-runner. Had much better experience at Morton\u2019s or even a Longhorn..",

Not a place I would bring kids to like a table across from us did asking \"Do you have chicken nuggets?\"  Definitely not that kind of place.  The staff was super friendly, attentive and all around wonderful. We where there celebrating our 16 year anniversary and they brought us some tasty wine for us.  The steaks are aged well so the flavors explode in your mouth with little need for lots of additional seasoning.  The tuna tartare was delicious and expertly crafted for a culinary display of excellence.  It's entertaining watching all the New Orleans craziness out on the street from the comfort of our cozy 5 star restaurant setting!  I can't wait to go back to NO for many reasons but especially to visit Doris Metropolitan for another round of delicious steaks!",

They also have a separate case by the bar where you can stop in and get the steaks to take home and prepare yourself. That's a nice perk! All of the appetizers we had were fantastic, but my favorite was the grilled artichoke hearts. The server was on top of her game and realized I was a lefty very quick into our meal and made it a point to place everything on my left side. You don't find attention like that very often. Sadly I do not remember her name, but she was amazing! We usually have Howie as our server, but he was off tonight. He is one of the best servers you'll find in the area. All of the meat was cooked perfectly to the desired temperature. While we were waiting for our dessert, I had to step away and make a phone call, when I finished it, I had the opportunity to speak to the kitchen manager and one of the other guys.  The manager was happy to have the chance to speak to a customer. I told him how fantastic our meal was and shared all of the details about the meal that made it a very great meal. He was all smiles and thanked me for taking the time to share our experiences with him.  We were one of the later tables in the establishment so when we left, the kitchen was taking trash out. The manager saw me standing with my family and he came down again and spoke with us, he also introduced us to several of the kitchen staff and told us their position. I felt like he really cared about the success of himself, the staff and the restaurant. The whole experience was one of the best I have had at any place I've dined.  From me and my entire family, this is the place to go if you want a very high quality steak and an amazing meal, service and overall experience. And I can't leave out the bartender, we arrived a little early and waited at the bar for the remainder of our party.  The bartender was great as well. When he described drinks, you could tell he knew their specialty drink by heart. There were 3 of us and each got one.  He was spot on in his descriptions. You definitely will not regret going here!",

I wouldn't change a thing about that and if I ever return it would be solely for that because there were so many reasons not to. The food just like the service was pretentious. My fiance and I were made to feel so out of place from the moment we sat down. We are not strangers to fine dining and know what good food is. Our server did all she could to make it known that our meal would not be cheap. As if we were unaware of the caviar, wine, and cuts of meat offered. We are locals who moved here from New York, we know how to find great food. So if I ask you for something you don't have maybe you should ask yourself why that is. I've never been to a steak house that doesn't offer a soup appetizer or a roasted potato side. Our plates were the saddest looking things with just a single charred onion and two mini mounds of salt sitting on the side. I could not believe this was all it was. I will say my filet was very good but I can make it just as good with a less expensive beef from the local market. The bone marrow was the most disgusting thing I've ever spat out. What the hell is that even about. Don't put that on anyone's plate and call it food. My fiance's porter house was mainly gristle, and he also missed having a nice side of potato on his plate. The truffle fries were ehh... nothing special. The salad, bread, and butters were delicious. I would have rather eaten more of that than those fries. In all I think Doris' Metropolitan needs to reconsider their menu choices. I mean we get it, you want to make bank. Just put more food on my plate first.",

Wow to the food, wow to the drinks, wow to the service, wow to the prices....  This was a special occasion, my daughter's 25th birthday, and our 32nd wedding anniversary. My daughter chose the restaurant. (She has good taste.) She knew some people in the industry so they were expecting us. A table was ready and they immediately brought us a complimentary drink, Cynar, an artichoke liqueur. I happened to try it the day before. If you are curious, it starts out sweet, then ends on a bitter note. Worth trying. I don't think I would want to experience a Cynar hangover.  Their steaks are dry aged and priced accordingly. We had agreed before going that we would order and share, having heard their portions are also large. However, they offer a chef's choice. You say how many ounces of meat you want per person and the chef puts together a spread. There were five of us, and I asked for eight to ten ounces per person. (I think it worked out to about four steaks in total.) We also ordered several sides - asparagus, grilled vegetables and truffle fries.  It really did not take long for the dinner to arrive. The meat comes out on a large butcher block, with it served flambe. The server slices the meat at the table. I am not 100% certain what cuts they were, but think we had Bone-in Rib Eye, Strip Steak, Tenderloin, and their Butcher's Cut. I cannot begin to describe the flavor and tenderness of every bite. The only disappointment was the size of the side orders which really were not enough for the table. They were all delicious.  They have a sommelier on staff who suggested a wine. It was a light bodied red wine that did not overpower the taste of the meat but had enough body to hold up to the other flavors. There was a lot of food and we finished every bite.  We were also comped for dessert because of the occasion. They brought small portions of Halvah, Olive Oil Cake, Chocolate Torte, and maybe they also brought some Affogato (but I'm not sure about that one). We also had coffee and espresso.  Their server to patron ratio was fabulous. We must have had three or four people serving us, checking in on us, and ensuring we were completely satisfied. They did a great job. I'm very happy my daughter suggested Doris Metropolitan. It was definitely worth the experience.",

Our server was Seth and he gave us subpar customer service. Actually subpar would be too generous for Seth. Although we inquired about various items on the menu we were met with condescension and a lackluster attitude. Instead of asking would we like a drink or describing the drinks on the menu we were met with \u201cAre you all drinking anything else besides water?\u201d in a snarky tone.Yes we were there late however we were not the only party seated. Seth\u2019s lack of customer service is a detriment to this establishment as I will not recommend it to anyone. Also the food was overpriced and underwhelming. Don\u2019t waste your money or time.",

We do have some dietary  restrictions and the staff was super attentive. The appetizers (tuna tartar, tomato festival and Kobe beef) were Devine. The steaks: I feel that it would not be an overestimate to say they are some of the best meats I encountered. They select only the best 2% out of all USDA approved meat.  The chef - Shachar (which we had a pleasure to meet) is truly an artist. The butchers cut is out of this world and the rib eye was spectacular. The desserts... OMG.... You just can't go wrong. We had the halva and the panna cotta deserts,  both amazing .  If you are in New Orleans, do yourself a favor and visit this place.",

This time I had company. We started off with the tuna tartare. Omg you must order this. The soy caviar and tiny splashes of sauces make the dish beyond amazing. We also tried the sweetbreads, it's another freaking must order.  As for entrees, I went with the 18oz 21 day aged ribeye for $44 It was cooked perfectly and i could barely eat it. I was determined but I started looking a little pregnant so I was like nooo lol.  My bf ordered the 12 oz tenderloin which came with bone marrow. Lol which he hates so muhahahaha I ate it. $68  Drinks: I ordered a nice Malbec and he ordered what would be their version of an old fashion. I told him to think twice about it, it was way tooo smokey. Like nasty smokey. I prefer a regular one.  Service was amazing. Booth seats are a bit too close for me. I would like a little more too. Other than that everything was absolutely amazing.",
