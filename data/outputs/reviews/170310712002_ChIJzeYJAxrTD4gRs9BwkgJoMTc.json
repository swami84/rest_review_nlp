We were seated in the back dining room, and had an amazing experience. The escargot presentation with the puff pastry was really interesting and delicious. The steak tartare and onion tarte made equally great impressions. They have a great wine list, and the dessert list made us want to order one of everything.  Service throughout was excellent. Attentive, yet still appropriately distanced. I didn't catch our server's name, but he was wonderful.  Thank you for a wonderful last night out, and I wish you all the luck possible in the coming months.",

While we had dinner I keeped seeing a rat \ud83d\udc00 run back and forth though out the night and  at some point it ran under my feet it was disgusting!! Since it look them so long to sit us down we were last to finish eating our diner. The bus boy (older guy) keeped giving us the stink eye and was throwing things around he seemed unhappy that we were still there and ai guess was trying to make us leave. I though that was really rude specially since it was not our fault that we got situated late and to top it all off they charged us twice for champagne on our bill. I don\u2019t even plan on going back to this restaurant ever again.",

I was served a bad wine and it was literally dumped out in front of me, no apologies, no explanations. The general attitude is just kind of unprofessional.

I was just about stuffed when my friend order this beautiful plate of chocolate mousse and that was when chez moi secured themselves a new customer for life.

Onion tart was the appetizer - a little like pizza, and I don't know if that was traditionally French. Our mains were lamb shank with couscous and a sea bass fillet. Both were perfectly done and full of taste. However the climax was gateau Breton, a short cake which must have been made with a load of butter with sea salt caramel trim I've never had anything that tasted like that, and I hope to again. Even the wine and bread were good. Service was attentive, and the price, although steep, was worth it.",

This is probably due to the fact that a lot of their food is prepared well in advance, their staff and management is a revolving door, and most importantly, Mon Ami Gabi is so much better. But I digress.  Now, I always found the Boeuf Bourguignon reliable. Until my most recent visit. Normally moist and tender, this time it came to me cold and dry. The mashed potatoes also were a tad gummy and gluey.  I decided to inform the manager. I believe his name is Chode? But per usual, he was distracted by friends, as he was far too comfortable and casual for them to be patrons. However, he did offer to give me 20% off for the inconvenience and a \"nice reach around\" if I was interested in following him downstairs.  I am not sure what a reach around is, but I hope it is not their \"hard-as-rock\" Brittany Cake.  Nevertheless, I will probably give them another chance in the near future. We will see if Chode can improve.",

Both of the dessert items one specifically recommended by my waiter and the one I decided to choose were bland, flavorless and most definitely isn't traditional French cuisine or pastry because ten years ago I visited Paris and I actually sampled traditional French pastries and desserts and what I received last night was just bad.  The server was very polite and chose dessert for me and I went with his suggestion and selected a gateau... resting on a gigantic moat of sweet caramel sauce and on top of the cake was a scoop of simple vanilla ice cream.  I bit into the butter cake but it was dry, heavy and bland.  I wanted to like it and I do have a sweet tooth but it wasn't tasty or creative nor pretty to look at .  All desserts here are way overpriced and for $9.25 i had expected my dessert to be flavorful and creatively prepared so the waiter took it back and I chose profiteroles instead but as pretty as they were I couldn't enjoy the floured hard biscuit pastry surrounding the vanilla ice cream .  I picked through my ice cream enjoyed the chocolate sauce and left the flavorless puff pastry dough behind.  He made a cocoa for me and since it wasn't a beverage they normally serve I was charged a fee of $4 and since it wasn't high end drinking chocolate I felt overcharged and underwhelmed.   I love sitting outside though and the service here was perfect but the desserts were so disappointing.  I came here to get desserts not dinner so I can't review the other items offered but I'm not sure I want to experience another meal here based on the bland desserts I tried.",

The good: Came here for a private event with a free 4-course meal along with wine pairings. The menu was fantastic. The pear salad was a perfect combo of sweet and creamy/savory with bleu cheese. The scallops were my favorite, drizzled with honey and a buttery polenta - a perfect combo. The lamb shank was also top notch, super tender and falling off the bone. The service was very friendly as was the main chef, who gave an intro and outro speech.  The not-so-good: The private room we were in was pretty cramped. The gateau breton was a little lackluster compared to all of the other magnificent courses, but it was still great.  Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Food: 9/10",

Ordered the mussels and the escargots. Mussels in Chicago always disappoint me, since they're so small, but at least the broth it was cooked in was delicious--- my friend went to town dipping her bread and the fries in the broth. I wasn't a fan of the escargot--- not flavorful enough--- they needed to salt the sauce. At least the puff pastry on top was an interesting touch.  Ordered the skate, which was prepared pretty well, but I still am just not a fan of skate. The rainbow trout had to be my favorite--- can't go wrong when you have fish and quinoa. Ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert, which was divine.  Our server was fantastic and super friendly. Good restaurant overall, but Paris Club still has to be my favorite for French food! -",

Inside is cute and the staff were overall, very nice.  We had the duck, steak frites, and creme brule.  1. The duck was amazing and so well portioned for the price.  2. Steak frites were solid, but I'd say just a hair on the side of too done for a medium rare steak and 3. the creme brule was amazing.  Only off part about the night was when our entrees came out one was wrong and while it took us a few minutes to flag someone down one of the runners said \"oh this is the wrong entree isnt it!\" and he quickly switched us out, so I'm assuming there was just a mix-up.  When the waiter came around to apologize he more or less blamed the runner.  Fine, no biggie.  Then we put in our dessert orders and the wrong dessert comes out again (for the couple we were with) and nothing was really said about it.  I just find that a little annoying, but hopefully those kinks are worked out soon.",
