After being seated by a less than friendly waitress/hostess - right in the line of the doorway on a very cold night when the restaurant was nearly empty, we didn't think it could get worse, but it did! The food was terrible. Calamari was tasteless rubber with a grainy, awful coating - we couldn't eat it. Entree's were even worse. Fish and chips tasted like the fish had been microwaved and the crab cake special was full of shell and hard, sharp bits. The rice was dried out and crunchy as if it had been sitting on the warmer for hours. Only the green beans were close to edible, but they had a sweet sauce on them that was odd. Our waitress was attentive and apologized - it wasn't her fault, but it was such a disappointing meal - would avoid Carroll's at all costs - very high prices for sub-standard food.",

Tried to drink it but too strong. 20-30 minutes to get a beer. We decided not to get 2nd round as we were headed to show. So we all order dinner. 4 meals come out. Mine and another came 20 minutes later. I ordered chicken marsala and got some other chicken dish. No time to deal with reorder. No appoligies from restaurant. Bob Marley was a riot thou",

I had never been to Carroll's (due to the construction on the Bridge, I tend to go to the other side of the Square) thankfully, the construction is almost completed because I will definitely go again. On one of the busiest days (Mother's Day AND a concert) and without a reservation, our hostess still seated us right away. Our party ordered fish tacos, steak tip dinner, and chicken piccata. Oh and we ordered a Juicy Juicer from the drink menu. Hands down best tasting drink I have EVER had. Now dinner. The fish taco's were excellent (not so much the pico de gallo as the mango was not ripe) the rice pilaf was nicely cooked. The steak tips were EXCELLENT. The mashed potato was good but the consistancy was wonky - too creamy. The chicken picante was well seasoned (they were out of capers, which was fine by my mum) but I thought the chicken to pasta ratio was off. The atmosphere was very pleasant. The bar was bright and spacious and had gorgeous views of the river. The dining room was huge with well spaced tables so that you were not crammed. It was clean and open and the pictures showing the history of the restaurant were really, really nice. On the down side... we were not given our bread basket until I asked but am glad I did. Carroll's should sell those rolls just on thier own. They are phenomenal. Wonderful fresh rolls with garlic and oil. We also had no idea the restaraunt had a dessert menu (it is separate and was not offered) we only found out on our way out the door to head to the local bakery for a dessert. Lastly, we probably would have liked another drink but our server didn't come around to ask. In the end great food! Service can always be improved upon as long as you have a good product. The menu is pricey, but the quality and portions justify the price. B+",

Comfort food gone wrong is all I can say. My food wasn't hot enough, flavors bland, poor presentation, and overly priced for what it was.  When it was time to pay, all of a sudden Maury Carroll himself came over and said  our groupon had expired and he wasn't going to accept it. My husband and I were very confused since there was a valid date displayed right there on the groupon. He said groupon extended the expiration date without his approval, so he wasn't obligated to honor it. I told him that sounded like an internal matter that he needed to take up with groupon, not with one of his customers. But no, Maury just walked away. Then his manager Ashley came over and told us that they lose money on Groupon. I've never been so humiliated. This was hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had. Poor service, poor management, poor food quality. Just the worst.",

I was so grossed out and told the waitress I wanted to speak to someone in charge about it. The owner came over and said \"I don't see any mice, I don't have mice\". Just as he said that the mouse ran right by him! Then he said \"oh well\". I was so disgusted and couldn't get out of there fast enough. I will NEVER go back and I will tell everyone I know not to go either. After looking through other reviews I saw a couple that have mentioned this place having mice too. GROSS!",
