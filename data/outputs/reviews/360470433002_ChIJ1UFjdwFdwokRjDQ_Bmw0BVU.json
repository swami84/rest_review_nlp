Let me say this first, the staff was cool. We cracked jokes and they were down to earth. If you live close please go in person as opposed to ordering off Seamless. Seamless takes 30% of every order profit and these people deserve 100% of it.  Now for the food. Probably one of the very few places that actually seasoned the fries right. I didnt need to add anything more salt or pepper. The chicken sandwich was nice and crispy. The spicy mayo added an extra awesomeness to it and I wish it never finished. The biscuit didnt need butter but if I had some it would have put it over the top. I will definitely come back. Oh btw ITS CONNECTED TO A BAR.",
