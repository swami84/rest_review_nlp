They were very confused as to why I didn't get my food. They were telling me that they only had a request from two streets over at the same building number. I confirmed with my recipe that I put in the address correctly and repeated the address about 4 times. I overheard the lady talking to another person saying it had been delivered.  Then she told me it was on it's way and she would call the driver and have them bring my food first. Great I check with maps and the restaurant is about 7 min away. After another 50 min wait I call them again. They let the phone go to voice mail about 5 times and picked up and hung up 2 times.  Then they finally called me back. They told me the food had been delivered about 10 minutes ago. I told them that I never received a call or notice. She instructed me to go to the door and I found my food on the floor outside my door. With the covid 19 going around I was completely grossed out with this and throw away all the outer packaging asap. At this point I was starving and ready to put the ordeal behind me and I thanked the lady and went to enjoy my meal. I open the shrimp spring rolls and the smell of raw fish hit me hard. They served me raw shrimp in my food. The shrimp was completely raw still transparent and I was disgusted. I tried calling back about 3 times before giving up on the entire restaurant. I will never order from them again I am extremely disappointed with the service provided and would not recommend trying it.",

I was told it would take 30-40 minutes.  35 minutes after placing the order I received a call to inform they were out of the flat rice noodles I ordered.  They asked if they could substitute with the thin rice noodles. I was hungry so I said OK.  After another 30 minutes the food arrived. I asked the delivery guy \"how much?\"  Since he spoke no English he just held the bill up in my face.  I had to go get my glasses to read the bill.  I had ordered Shrimp dumplings ($7) and spicy steak noodles ($14) but the bill was $30.  I had to call the restaurant to point out the overcharge and they said I was correct and it would be $22.85.  As for the food itself, it was mediocre.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough to overcome the lapses in service.  There are better Thai options in the neighborhood and I won't be ordering from here again.",
