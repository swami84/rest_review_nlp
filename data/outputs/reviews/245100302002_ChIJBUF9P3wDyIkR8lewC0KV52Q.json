Scallops are my favorite and they were...meh.... unimpressed. Our waiter Neil was awesome and made the dinner great! The maitre was a bump on a log and I might even say a touch rude. One our way out didn\u2019t even say how was your meal or service or experience etc....however he did ask others that seemed to be regulars. We would never go back but thanks Neil!

We had a table with an amazing view of the city and water.  I had the 8oz dry aged filet with the restaurant's version of a Bee's Knees, which was an amazing twist on a classic gin cocktail. I recommend both.  We had different people come up to assist our table, one of the most memorable being Stephanie who helped my table decide on cocktails by giving recommendations. But also the manager Chris who went out of his way to stop by my table and wish me and my friend happy birthday.  Overall I had such a good experience.

The view is immaculate, especially since our reservation was booked for a time when the sun was just going down. Aviance along with the customer service was exquisite. Our server Anna was very attentive and she made knowledgeable recommendations while discussing the menu. The establishment was extremely clean and everyone certainly practiced social distancing. The gentleman downstairs when you first arrive was a little off-putting because we were not sure exactly what his purpose was while trying to check us in. Next, you have to get on the elevator to the top floor and go to another desk to confirm your reservation. We were seated promptly however I was a little disappointed because there was very very limited outside seating that really had an opportunity to take in the view so I will definitely try to get an outdoor table during my next visit. Also there is mention of a dress code on their website, however patrons arrived in ripped jeans, sneakers, etc and we're not dressed business casual . Had I known this would not have been strictly enforced I would have dressed down. Personally dressing nicely fits better considering the environment and the staff are dressed quite well. We were advised that their menu is seasonal, however the menu that was online did match what we were given so that was an added bonus. I will say that the portions are just enough so I certainly would not recommend coming here if you are over-the-top hungry. I did leave fulfilled not full but I had enough to eat. Everything that they had as a presentation regarding food and otherwise was amazing, however I was utterly disappointed that the Rockfish arrives in a bag as if it were a seafood boil that they cut open at the table before serving and placing on the table. It was almost as if I was eating out of a grocery bag. The macaroni and cheese had a much better presentation and it was in a small pan. The food tasted fresh and was definitely good but I would have rather them had different plating regarding the fish. The desserts are very small but tasty. The drinks are very nice. There was a drink that we tried and it was not to our liking and our server and was able to accommodate us by recommending something else which was an added bonus. The bottled water is $10 and it is a full bottle of Voss. Very attentive during the service and a busser will clear away any used and unneeded silverware and if there are any refills or anything that is needed someone is always there to assist. The service for this evening was flawless even down to the payment method. I would recommend this place for dining.",

We waited 45 minutes to get drink refills, and 2 hours for our food, which came out flavorless and the meat was very overcooked and tough. My mom sent her steak back and was still charged for the meal, without any apology or intent on making amends. We were there for 3 hours total, had 2 glasses of wine (as we went to the bar because our server wasn\u2019t coming by and they wouldn\u2019t let us order from the bar either) and saw our server a total of 3 times in those 3 hours. Very disappointed all around, not the kind of birthday I wanted with family here from out of town!

Everything was prepared perfectly, all were top 1/2/3 best we have had. The cocktails were amazing too. Do yourself a favor and try the Lion's Tail. Our server was so attentive, & even brought a champagne toast, as we were celebrating our \"1st date night in 6 months\", super sweet of her.

Our waiter Nil S. was awesome!! He was polite, friendly, listened to what we wanted, and was able to recommend items that would be to our liking. His customer service was excellent! We also received some great surprises as a compliment of the chef, which was a very nice addition to an already perfect dining experience! The view of the Harbor also added that special touch.

As such, we were recommended to see \"the best view in Baltimore\" and visit The Bygone. When we arrived, there was a very strict dress code of which one member of my group was not in accordance with. That's fine, and because of this he went across the street to J.Crew to buy attire and enter with the remainder of our group. On his way back in, another group was out of dress code and let in without the flinch of an eye. Once we all arrived upstairs, we were met by several guests in sweatshirts and sneakers. This made my group not only uncomfortable, but feel highly discriminated against. We approached the manager Julian with our discomfort, and he sent their doorman to sit at our table and argue with us about his reasoning for letting the others out of dress code in and not my group. Throughout our experience at The Bygone, our cocktail waitress gave us attitude and rolled her eyes the entire time. We overheard her speaking with a bartender about our group and belittling us. Discrimination and racism aside, this venue served subpar cocktails and needs to reevaluate their interpretation of the word hospitality. We were not after a free drink, we are accustomed to several rounds of $25 cocktails in NYC coupled with unparalleled service. I don't recommend this establishment unless you are after an amateur waitstaff. Save your money unless you enjoy lack of professionalism, cheaply made drinks and a horrific experience. Shame on you Four Seasons.",

Then One of their employees told us that we had to vacate the spot we were in because somebody ordered bottle service. There was no reserved sign on the table and we were not told before hand that it was a bottle service spot Even after we had ordered dessert and drinks. When we asked why we were not told about it, the lady was very rude for no reason at all and told us that we needed to vacate the table. We were flabbergasted. Yes, they have a prime spot but their employees have been rude as of late. We WERE going there next weekend with a big group to celebrate a couple of friend\u2019s birthdays but thanks to this situation that just happened we will be changing our plans. We will also be sending a \u201cnice\u201d email to Atlas management.",

Now for the food---I had bacon that was way undercoooked, a quiche that was cold, a cut of prime rib that was room tempature and bread that was stale. The shrimp coctail was over cooked and the desserts were bland. The best thing I had was a chocolate quasaunt which I could have gotten for a lot less at Panera Bread.

The drink menu was packed w unique items which we enjoyed in the bar area that was beautifully decorated and furnished. It was our anniversary so we got seated in a somewhat secluded area w an amazing view of the harbor ( wish we had made it in time for sunset that has to be a gorgeous sight from there) We are pescaterian do it was great to see that they had plenty of seafood options for the hubs and I starting w the BBQ oysters  \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe  and deviled eggs which were \"meh\" deviled eggs... My husband had the Chilean seabass and I had the fried lobster which was AMAZING, moist and tender although for $65 I expected it to come w a starch and it didn't. I ordered mashed potatoes but they ran out and offered me rice instead . Had I not ordered a side I would have still been hungry so that was a tad bit disappointing. For dessert we had an apple pie and slice of chocolate cake which was a good end to our night. The atmosphere at the Bygone is definitely top notch, plenty of loungy areas to hang out and have a drink. If it wasn't so cold I would have stepped outside and enjoyed the fire pit table on the balcony. I highly recommend this place for any occasion.",

I just didnt care for the flavors and the selections for the price was just not worth it. The french toast and cold bar ( oysters and shrimps) was delicious. The endless drinks were on their best. At Rusty's the drinks are in the brunch price..But every body has their preference. ENJOY",

The scallop and cauliflower appetizers were amazing, Snapper and Lobster Thermidor were also excellent. Whatever the Asiago cheese bread to start was were also perfect. We\u2019d heard various reviews but this place is one of the best in town, going for that speak-easy prohibition vibe and hitting it. We\u2019ll be back to try more. It\u2019s also really nice not to see people in sports jerseys and flip flops, which is so common these days. You can also stop by the Loch Bar, right on the water, on the way out. There is paid valet parking at the hotel entrance.",

Upon arrival we were escorted upstairs, and taken to our table. The table wasn't ready (in fact it was dirty) so we returned to the hostess stand to wait. Once we were finally seated, we were handed menus. We had to ask the server why we had menus... and wasn't the chef's table for a \"chef's menu?\" I'm still not sure what the answer is, but apparently the chef's menu is available to anyone in the restaurant. We were offered cheese popovers or protests rolls... We opted for the popover, but I'm hindsight should have had the rolls. The popovers were burned, and not very good . The food we were served on the menu was decent, and we opted for the wine pairing... It was very disorganized, and no explanation was given for why the wines were chosen for each course. The waygu beef was the highlight, and was amazing. The chef seemed to be less than thrilled, and we didn't get much time with him. There wasn't any explanation of the where or why ingredients were chosen for the course. The Baked Alaska (like each course) had beautiful presentation... but came up short of expectations.  Bottom line, the staff was kind and friendly. The view of Baltimore was spectacular, but the meal simply wasn't worth the $500ish (for two). I lament the fact that I saw several dishes roll by that looked much better than our selections.",

We had a corner table with a gorgeous view of Baltimore. I enjoyed all the table side preparation of the food, especially the Duck Agnolotti A La Presse. That was the best dish! Definitely recommend that.  John our server provides exceptional customer experience. John and the Assistant Manger, Ian even brought one of our guest to meet with Ed Reed who was laying down some groovy beats. Really made her night!  We then had some cocktails on the balcony which is a really great way to take in the view of the skyline and marina.  Will definitely be back!",

The table sat in a dark back corner with a decent view. Some time passed and we noticed someone had spilled water all over the table and floor prior to us being seated and no one noticed it until we spoke up. The mess was cleaned and it was time to order. Like most places the server tried to upsell us even after I insisted we knew what we wanted. We ordered the beef Wellington and a snapper. After ordering our food the waiter never checked on us and time started to pass. About an hour and a half after ordering (2hrs from being sat) we still hadn't gotten our food so I decided it was time to leave. We get up to leave and look who miraculously shows up our waiter and he was so sure our food was coming up next so we took his word for it and sat back down. 25 minutes later guess who's food finally appeared. Yay us! only to find that it was basic and flavorless. I was super annoyed and just over the whole experience The only reason this place got a 2  stars was for the decor and the really nice elevator attendant/elevator experience. I honestly would not reccomend this place to anyone.",

We had beet salad, duck agnolotti a la presse, 45 days dry aged Kansas City Strip and a wagyu sirloin. The steaks were very good and the agnolotti were someting truly special. Finally, any place that serves Yamazaki 18 should be visited! At the same time, some very serious mistakes were made, two of which were absolute no-gos that other restaurants we frequent simply handle a lot better. First, we ordered a bottle of wine with one server, and then another server brought us the wrong bottle. Instead of simply exchanging the bottle, she decided to throw her colleague who had taken the order under the bus. I find this an extremely bad sign and not done. If you have a problem with a colleague, pick it up with that person; not with the customers! Second, the desserts, a selection of ice creams and sorbets were usprisingly tastless. in our opinion it was so bad, that it was very difficult to believe that the chef had checked on it before it went out of the kitchen. Third, we were charged for two bottles of wine, the one that we sent back and the one that we drank. Of course I should have noticed this when I paid. Instead I noticed it the following day and sent all the details by email and offered a constructive solution. I also mentioned this to the hotel staff when they asked if everything had been to our satisfaction. That was more than two weeks ago; until today I have not received any feedback on this. Update May 22, 2019 - a day after I posted the above review I was contacted by management and they refunded the bottle of wine we didn\u2019t have. I was also contacted by the Four Seasons management who wanted to make sure everything was now okay. It is. I\u2019m the rating to an average of 3 stars; the agnolotti get 5, the steaks and beet salad 4, the ice cream and sorbet 1 and the service 2.",

The waiter was very much a salesman who added $20/ea to our meal unbeknownst to us. My meal was served room temperature with layers of cold. There was paper in my food confirmed by the chef and we were still charged for the dish. The side dish was salty.  Our view which I'm told is the reason to overpay for the food was of a hotel. The fried cauliflower which came highly recommended was mostly bread.  We chose not to complain because we were celebrating a friend's birthday. Disappointing. Again, one and done.

We were sat at a table in a corner where a curtain was impeding our personal space. We pushed back the curtain to see bright orange electrical tape. A major part of the experience here was the view, so being sat in a corner with bright orange tape took away from the 1920s experience. The hostess took 45 minutes to seat us after we had arrived for our reservation. We initially waited 20 minutes and then asked if we could sit at the bar until our table was ready. We received a text notification right before we ordered our drinks (about 10 minutes later) so we left the bar empty handed. At that point the hostess told us we actually had to wait about another 15 minutes before we could actually be seated - so we could have stayed at the bar until receiving a second text confirmation about our table. The highlights of this experience were the entertaining elevator host, the views of the city, the decor, the food, and the knowledgable waiter. I would love to come here again, but I would not go through the hassle of getting a table here. In the future I would love to just go sit at the bar (where no reservation is needed) and watch the sunset.",

We did not leave until 12midnight due to extremely SLOW service. They had a 5-course menu but did not disclose until arrival that they had a set menu for Valentine's which was different than the menu online. The menu options were limited and honestly, the food was not good for $150.00 per person. You all should be ashamed of yourself at the Bygone for that menu. Customers like to have menu options. We ended up packing our dinner entree and desserts to go because they took so long to serve us and other guests. The waiter did not bring water and would disappear for long times and the order in the kitchen was horrible. The waiters seemed flustered trying to keep guests calm for the delay in service. This place should have been better prepared for the Valentine's Holiday. The skyline views are nice but that is about it. Ian, the manager, could care less about complaints made upon speaking to him this morning. I will be contacting the owner and proceeding with letting others know of the HORRIBLE service and dining experience at this place. Bygone, BE GONE!",

This special day had a special menu at a steep price, but there were acceptable options for each course except the first. Most of the food was absolutely amazing. The lobster and asparagus salad was special. The baked oysters might have been the best thing I have ever eaten in a restaurant.  Sadly, the beef Wellington as the final course came out nearly raw, and while the service was talented and attentive, the kitchen was woefully unable to keep up with demand. OUR FIVE COURSE MEAL TOOK NEARLY FIVE HOURS TO COMPLETE. At first, it was a pleasure to not be rushed, to enjoy the scenes and service, but after 2 hours we began to realize there were problems.  This place could be a very special experience in a more normal night. Maybe someday we will try again.  Kudos to Brenda and Darcell for their attentive service. Leandre as the elevator operator is an entertaining introduction to the establishment.",

Considered reserving dinner for a party of 18 but after reading reviews for restaurant we chose another downtown upscale restaurant. Drink prices here OVERPRICED..2 ran us about $35...but that\u2019s expected. What wasn\u2019t expected was the service from the general manager. We arrived with 12 people for drinks about 8:30pm, sat in lounge area but decided to splurge on bottle service in the bar area seating. A young lady/server shared bottle service menu and told us the two bottle minimum purchase for our group size. After she checked with manager..he talked with me and the minimum went to three bottles. When I told him we really just wanted the champagne with confetti for wife\u2019s birthday he \u201ccountered\u201d with one spirit and one champagne, but this time the champagne was from their premium list ($800 cheapest bottle from this list). Felt like I was dealing with a car salesman. Kindly told him thank you but no thank you. Well we proceeded to have a good time in the lounge and whiskey bar until 12am. During this time majority of reserved areas remained open. So a friend checked again with \u201csalesman\u201d and was told no. We even said we\u2019d pay for just the champagne bottle celebration and stay in lounge area..no go. Guess the salesman felt he could get a better deal. The reserved area in whiskey bar remained open for entire time we were there. Just expected accommodations for our party size/event that would match quality of service bygone claims. And salesman could\u2019ve made out much better $ wise without giving up a reserved spot. We spent much less..even with the overpriced drinks..than we would\u2019ve with the bottle service but still would\u2019ve shook on the deal. Turned us away from bringing a large party to bygone again.",

They are attempting to force an extremely upscale vibe, but failing on the little touches and alienating higher end customers.  Eg shots $15 each but the cocktail girls are dressed out of forever 21 carrying confetti bottles.  Went there again with a group of friends last night and we were ordered out of our seats at the bar around 10pm, with security telling us they turn into a club at night.  I know for a fact no one dances there from prior visits and they were simply creating artificial demand because not enough people were buying bottle service in order to sit on outer edges.  Wardrobe enforcement is also inconsistent; saw an older woman thrown out for wearing clogs but a younger guy wesring sneakers was allowed.  Bartenders are ok but a bit snippy at times.  Go spend your money at one of the other truly classy bars in the area.",

        "caption": "I've been putting off writing this because I only want to say nice things. And now 2 months have gone by with no response from the restaurant after I sent them the following letter. So now this goes public: Bygone is the place that Baltimore sorely needs. We've been to Michelin starred restaurants all over Europe and Asia and we consider ourselves foodies and appreciate truly wonderful service. We don't mind paying for it either. However, on our recent visit for my husband's birthday, I made a reservation and brought my parents, whom we aren't able to see very often due to scheduling difficulties and distance. My mother was very much looking forward to trying the Dover sole and my husband the Amish chicken. Neither was available. My mother's second choice was likewise not available. How disappointing! Our waiter kept joking that we'd have to come back to try them. We already see my parents only once or twice a year. I hardly think I'll open them up to this disappointment again! I'm sure my husband and I will make an attempt, but of course, not with them. I feel that when you offer a $95 entree and people come in excited to try it, and that's the first thing they say when they sit down, you should maybe mention that you're out of it. Oh, and don't EVER be out of it. My parents just returned from a trip to Russia, and so were excited to order caviar, but we joked that it probably wasn't available, and so did not order it. We were tired of being told no. Otherwise, the service was excellent, the drinks were spot-on. We have no complaints about our second and third choices, but that's what they were--not what we came for. At least we got our views of the city. I just wanted to explain that people do come for the food experience as well. Also, my husband's birthday was never acknowledged. Perhaps that sort of thing is not done at such an upscale place, but I will say that the Ritz in Hong Kong made quite an unexpected spectacle of our anniversary, so that can't be it. Maybe it was forgotten. Surprising for so grand a place. It's so difficult to get a reservation at your restaurant, and equally difficult to get your choice of entree! It's unfortunate, because I really would have loved to. What a shame.",

When my guest and I got off the elevator, the ladies at the front were clearly snobs. It's like they did not even know what the definition of GREAT customer service was! Our party received nasty mugs during our wait for the other guests to arrive. The party was for 24 people and we were told atleast half of the party must be in attendance in order to be seated. Once we reached 11 people, we were told 15 people must be there. Once we got 13 people there, we asked if we could please be seated, as people were running extra late, and we were waiting for an hour. We were told in a nasty way by the lady at the front \" 15 ppl\". Nothing else. Just \"15 people\". In addition, we were told that they carry a strict dress code. They turned away two people from our party for having on the wrong shoes. However, a group of 4 ( Caucasian) came in with jeans and tennis shoes, and were greeted in the most respectful manner. Our waiter was HORRIBLE. Who curses in front of guests? Screwed our checks up and all.  Long story short, if your African American, do not expect good customer service from this place. In addition, the food was HORRIBLE. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the view was beautiful!",
