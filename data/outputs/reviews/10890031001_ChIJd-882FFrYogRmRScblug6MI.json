The venue is so nice and comfortable with an eclectic interior and music piped in at just the right level - loud enough to hear but soft enough to talk over. Our server and menu guide was Heidi and she was marvelous. There was some nice, economical selections of \"happy hour\" wines and \"mystery beers.\" Our sandwiches were so darn good that you wanted to take more home for later. I had the BLT-DS and my friend had the tuna melt. We shared a creme brulee for dessert. An amazing experience at a very special place. P.S. Room is limited so reservations, even for lunch, are probably a good idea.",

Appetizers chosen ranged from charcuterie boards with meats and cheeses chosen by us, to some of the best deviled eggs I have had recently. The dinner choices were equally varied, from unique twists on classic sandwiches to a limited selection of main dishes. I chose the lamb meatballs, cooked in a slightly spicy sauce and served over a bed of couscous. The meatballs were very tasty, lightly spiced and full of a mild lamb flavor. While I am not normally a fan of couscous, the sauce from the meatballs settled into it and I found myself devouring every trace. I reserve one star back for a couple of minor issues. Firstly, eating alfresco here means sitting on metal folding chairs. One of our party suffered a loss of dignity when the chair decided to give way while he was sitting. Better chairs would alleviate this issue. Secondly, their beer selection lists a dozen or so on tap. However, all are lighter colored brews, from pilsners to the ever trendy IPAs. Not a decent dark beer in sight. The iced tea wasn't bad, though.",

We've had four different servers, each of whom was friendly and very capable of suggesting good wine pairings. During peak hours things get busy, so reservations are a good idea. Particularly given that this is a European-style place where taking your time is valued, the reservation system is more art than science--so if you're OCD about that sort of thing, be prepared.

I would have no problem being asked to move to a smaller table for a larger party, but She rudely came over and told me that she had the table \"reserved\" at 12:30 and placed a sign on the table that I was sitting at. I mentioned to her that it was 12:34 because I thought it was so odd, and she told me to move. I love downtown Huntsville and I'm always in for a new place. I live within walking distance of this one. I also own a local business. I support local and I thought Domaine South would be my new go to lunch spot. Never again.
