However, today has permanently changed our opinion of this business.  We had several issues with our order (everything was cold, the milkshake had melted, we were missing one of our sodas, and the bacon burger was missing the bacon), so we called the restaurant to get the issues resolved.  The person who took the call was rude, put me on hold for over three minutes, came back on the line and acted as though he did not know why I was calling.  After repeating the issues, he asked what I wanted, but before I could make a suggestion, he presented two unacceptable options to resolve the issues (full refund and they would pick up the order, or get a replacement order to arrive at an undetermined time and they would pick up the bad order).  When we explained that we have been waiting nearly two hours for our food and just sending a replacement order would not be enough, he asked me to hold. I was surprised when he returned to the phone and asked me what I wanted to do.  It was as though a reset button was pressed, except that when I asked for a new order and a credit on our account, he interrupted me and explained that they gave me my options so which do I choose.  Again, I explained the inconvenience of the situation, and again he put me on hold. Now I was thinking, this must be when I will get to talk to a manager, but instead, the same employee came back on the line and would you believe he again asked me what I wanted to do.  This experience continued for several minutes. After we could endure no more, we concluded the call, informed them that we would no longer do business with them, and lodged a complaint with the food delivery service.",
