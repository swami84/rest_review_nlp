The store also has a sign saying that they have vegan options, soy free, etc.; but nothing is labeled to help a customer know whether something is gluten free, vegan, soy free, or otherwise. For a place that is supposed to be conscientious of peoples allergies (gluten intolerance, etc.), it's hard to believe that it lacks any kind of nutritional information.  Customer service was totally lacking. We ordered several pastries and ate in the store. After 30 minutes in the store not once did an employee greet or say goodbye to a customer. Greeting customers and making them feel welcomed and invited is the corner stone of any business. As for the pastires, we found them to be overpriced and extremely dry. I would not recommend this bakery for those truly interested in high quality gluten free options.",

My mom - who LOVES dessert and is VERY content with almost anything, i.e. easy to please - said the chocolate cake was flavorless and not very sweet.  The next day she tried the carrot cake cupcake and said it was quote \"awful\" and as flavorless as the chocolate one, and she didn't taste any spices like you would expect in carrot cake. She only ate half of the cupcake. My mother does not NOT finish dessert. So it had to be pretty bad for her to only eat half.  Overall I am very disappointed. My mom did not enjoy either item and I bought them thinking it would be a nice treat for her.",

Unfortunately, my experience left me wishing I had never stepped foot in Rise Bakery or had even supported this business. Firstly, there\u2019s no prices anywhere! Of course they have $3.50 cupcakes labeled but that\u2019s it! Even the to-go menu didn\u2019t have prices! When I asked the woman at the register how much the sandwiches were she didn\u2019t know either and had to ring up each individual sandwich. After finding out a ham and cheese by itself was $10.50 I didn\u2019t even want a sandwich anymore (and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t). Now I decide to order a cupcake because if I didn\u2019t like it, at least I was only loosing $3.50... let me just say that cupcake was SO dry... Rise Bakery should be called Sand Bakery because that cupcake tasted like cold sand. I\u2019m my opinion, they put no effort in make those cupcakes... maybe all there effort went into making their $10.50 sandwiches. Needless to say, I walked away highly disappointed and very sad that a place for gluten free people was selling terrible products. I\u2019ve had better from the grocery store...",

The gluten-free croissants are one of a kind and they make fresh gluten-free brioche, sourdough and gluten-free breakfast sandwiches. It gets crowded, especially on weekends but you can usually find a seat on weekdays.  They have a pretty wide variety of sweets and pastries (I'd recommend the eclair and the cinnamon roll), but I've been most impressed with the variety and the quality of the bread. They make a lot of it fresh every day and they also keep additional breads, bagels and croissants stocked frozen.  Overall, I'd say it's the best gluten-free bakery I've ever been to. A close second would be Noglu in Paris. Rise is the cream of the crop in the good ol' USA!",

I waited for over 20 minutes and they had lost my order, so I had to re-order and wait even longer. Then, for a party at work, I ordered a blueberry pie by phone three days ahead of time. When I came to collect, they had given the pie to someone else! Later they called to say the person brought it back, but by then I was in my VA office. Won't try a third time.",

The Rise bagels, croissants, and brioche made tea sandwiches so good that wheat eating guests may become converts to gluten free. The Rise gluten-free scones were biggest hit -- gingery sweet in taste, creamy crumb texture--a real treat. I arranged a pre-order and it was boxed perfectly and ready to go for pickup on the morning of the shower.  Mike and colleagues are great to work with. For those of us who live outside Adams Morgan, Rise is definitely not a cinch to get to, but well worth the effort. If you're  walking or hanging out on 18th Street don't walk by.  Walk up the stairs and go try something on their excellent menu.",

You need to place an order 48 hours in advance to get a cake which seems a little ridonculous so I ended up getting cupcakes instead, the order was not correct so the manager offered his apologies and a 50% discount which definitely made me like the place a lot.  As far as the cupcakes go, after taking a small bite of the red velvet cupcake, my knees became weak and I started hallucinating that I was riding on a unicorn through rainbow land and swimming through that incredibly delicious cream cheese topping. Apparently, a few minutes later I came to, on the floor; everyone was staring at me and I had satisfied look on my face which warranted a cigarette; except, I don't smoke. It was only then that I realized that my oral euphoric orgasm was caused by rise bakery's use of magical elf crack, which they stir in a cauldron stolen from Harry Potter himself and sprinkled on their cupcakes using fairy dust from neverland while holding an infinity stone. I have been craving those cupcakes ever since. Thank you Rise Bakery for your delicious cupcakes, and I hate you for making me addicted. ;)",

I went to this bakery at after hearing all the fuss and seeing the great reviews however was disappointed. I got a chocolate croissant, chocolate cupcake and bag of 4 plain bagels. Not trying to be a negative Nancy but none of it was good. The croissant was extremely dense and tasted nothing like a croissant, the bagels too were extremely dense and I struggled to eat just 1/2 of the bagel and the cupcake, frankly I've made gluten-free cupcakes that taste better. Also, while I am use the the higher cost of gluten-free items, I spent over $20 for the 3 items and ended up throwing it all away after a few bites.  Maybe my taste buds are different but I've had better free gluten free bakery items. I personally would not recommend this bakery to any of my  colleagues, friends or family. Just my opinion. Maybe they had a bad batch or bad day, regardless, I won't be wasting my money again. People like what they like so if you like then continue to enjoy. If you have never been then I recommend proceeding with caution and venturing there only if you truly have money to throw away.",

There were lots of vegan bakery options too for my boyfriend (who isn't gluten-free, but enjoyed his gluten-free cupcake.)  They have some of the best gluten-free bread too -- sub buns, rolls.  I stop by for a bagel w/ cream cheese at least once a week. It's a great spot with a cozy seating section and friendly staff.",
