My coworkers and I work nearby and have smelt them making kimchi for about a month or two before it opened. And that got our hopes up. But when they finally opened it was mostly their menu had ramen, cold noodle, kimbap and tteokbokki. I ordered the ramen with cheese and kind of bummed. It looked and tasted like shin ramen. And the cheese ended up sinking to the bottom of the bowl and getting stuck there. But the sides that they gave out were excellent! Best kimchi I've ever tasted so I said I would try it again if they started cooking a. And little by little I saw the menu expand. so I stopped in and and got the kimchi fried rice and bulgogi. It's much better than what I was expecting. Next time I'll try more items but definitely worth popping in.  Oh they sell their kimchi now too!",
