It\u2019s now an empty shell of what it used to be and the staff is incredibly rude and clearly has no real service experience.  Their was no menu anywhere, no food anywhere, no aromas, no deserts , no vibe.  Just a cold kitchen with bad energy !  I was rudely told to scan a url for the menu that was not even in a location comfortable  to scan.  What a sad joke, good luck with your business , I\u2019ll never come here again after dozens of visit , sad.",

Aside from the fried food, which is fried at order, the other items are precooked and sitting in warming trays. So, if you order chicken and rice say (which is a good order and tasty but not exactly \"fish house\" fare) they scoop it out a generous portion and put it on a plate. The fried food (conch) was tough and excessively seasoned with some type of seasoned salt. I LOVE salt, but this was almost inedible because it was so salty. Plastic cutlery, styrofoam plates and canned beverages from an open iced cooler. That's the style. There is nothing resembling fresh and healthy seafood. The pics on Google are deceiving and look like NOTHING I saw available at the restaurant. The interior has been freshened up, but the bathroom was so dirty it was unusable. On the plus side, an employee was nice enough to let me use the employee restroom. Overall, I think if you order selectively, you might be OK, but I won't be back. It's not a fish house, it's just a step up from a cafeteria.",

        "caption": "Was in the downtown area and decided to browse for something easy and quick to eat when I stumbled upon Zubi's yelp page. Their page had some mixed reviews, but was in a hurry so decided to take a chance on the small cafeteria styled eatery in Little Haiti that shares a building with a neighborhood grocery & seafood market. This is definitely to their advantage and is probably why their seafood is phenomenal-- considering their using all fresh ingredients. The only thing I can say I disliked about the interior of the restaurant were the seats! I'm not too much of a nit-picky gal but they were so uncomfortable that my boyfriend ended up standing half way through our meal till we were finished. Strange but true!  The food though, on the other hand, I really could never find any complaints for because each seafood item was cooked perfectly and correctly. My boyfriend and I ordered the sample platter appetizer which included fried calamari, 2 conch fritters, 2 croquettes, and 3 tostones for $6.99. The whole dish blew us out of the water but the insanely tender fried calamari was our favorite served in strips instead of the traditional rounds most restaurants do. The conch fritters were also very notable because unlike most restaurants there were actually large chunks of well cooked conk distributed evenly within the tropical island-styled batter used. Next we ordered the shrimp po'boy for $6.99 to share. I honestly didn't think it would be anything too special, really was just an impulsively gluttonous order from two hungry people which is why when it was so good it blew us away. We recently ate through New Orleans' food scene and this sandwich could easily compete as a better choice then those that we tried there. Lastly we gobbled down their fresh whole fried snapper entree for $10.99 that came with two sides in which we chose seafood rice and fried yuca. The woman cooking the fish even came out to ask us how crispy we would like it in which of course we went for the very, very, crispy. It was cooked to perfection; each bite delivered a slight crunch atop moist fresh fish. Particularly liked the side seafood rice as well and made for a great leftover snack later that day!  Will definitely be back and will recommend to others as a place where you don't have to pay exorbitant prices to eat really delicious seafood. They were out of their famed minuta sandwiches so I really look forward to tasting those next time I venture there!  IG: KFitzEats",

They make everything from scratch and have different daily specials everyday, I had the conch fritters as an appetizer and they were awesome, you get three for a dollar. I had a Minuta sand which and some fried shrimp and everything was on point. Definitely coming back for more.",
