They made sure to take our temperatures before letting us inside. We also had to complete a questionnaire regarding covid symptoms online available via their QR code. Their menu is also available online via a QR code on each table. The setting of the brunch spot is minimalistic and elegant, with hints of white and blue accents. They also have an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs prepare your meal.  I had the matcha latte and my friend the hot chocolate. They have so much variety of milk available to choose from: macadamia, almond, oat, coconut, and whole. You can choose the other unique options besides whole milk for an additional 50\u00a2. I tried the matcha latte with macadamia which was tasty. I liked the fact that it wasn't sweet and I can actually taste the matcha. The macadamia milk also sits well with my lactose intolerant stomach. The drinks came in cute little cups. It's a cute little spot on the corner of Kent Avenue and Grand Street.",
