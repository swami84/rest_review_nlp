The beef did not have the common chewy and gristly texture that is typical of most places. It tasted good and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meat. Rice was cooked perfect with no stale or burnt pieces. In addition, the pork fried rice had nice chunky pieces of pork.  Egg roll that came with the combination was not overly greasy and didn't have that weird oil taste. Crispy outside and great texture inside.  Seems like they're better about changing their oil.  For those who want to dine in, the location is clean and spacious, you'll find a visble A rating outside the window. No sticky tables, chairs or strong unpleasant smells. Service is really fast, as others have mentioned. That being said, I should state that I placed my order at the location so I didn't experience any of the service issues others have mentioned through phone ordering.  Overall, this is a much takeout spot in comparison to what you'd find around the Kensington area.",

The woman on the phone was rude and couldn't understand me when taking the order I just let it go because I really like the owner and he's always been very nice to me.  My order was wrong when it arrived so I called and the same lady picked up the phone and said that I ordered wrong because I didn't understand her!! LOL She hung up on me! I called again and spoke to the owner this time and he was very rude too and said he was very busy! Well I wasn't having it so I went there with my order, demanded my money back and  told them I was never going to order from them again they didn't even care!!!!! So, let's say I did order wrong (which I know I didn't bc I order the same all the time) isn't the customer always right? I know if that was my business and I had a customer for 10 years I would not treat them that way! I could see if I complained all the time but this is the FIRST time I ever called them about my order being TOTALLY wrong!!!  And they always forget to put fortune cookies in my order and I never bothered them. What is Chinese food without fortune cookies?!",
