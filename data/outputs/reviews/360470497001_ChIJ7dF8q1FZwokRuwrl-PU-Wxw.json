The veal with eggplant dish had hard uncooked eggplant with the same oldish tasting hard veal. We were flabbergasted. Our third guest would not eat his dish either which was pasta and a cream sauce. It was as if it came out of a can. How could it have been that bad? In Brooklyn! PS: I thought the cooks wear masks. I looked in and none did. Why did this place get such a high rating?  We simply left some cash on the table and left. The food was practically untouched. The waiter didn\u2019t even say he was sorry but protested that he eats it all the time. Quite disappointed with this so-called restaurant.",

Started with cold antipasto platter for each table consisting of sliced meats, roasted red and hot green peppers, portobello mushrooms and mozzarella and tomato. Excellent bread as well. Two pasta dishes were very good, followed by entrees (choice of chicken parmesan, baked filet of sole, or veal marsala). Everyone was very pleased with whichever dish they had. At the end, they provided a delicious assortment of Italian cookies. Very nice choice for a special party.",

        "caption": "Great food. Friendly staff. Quaint cozy space. It's small but cozy. - that first sentence is what I wrote a year ago. But my visit just recently was not great. My husband was disappointed in his eggplant rollatini appetizer two little tiny rollatinis came out and for the price they charged that played should have been a lot bigger. My arugula Walnut goat cheese salad came out with not one stitch of goat cheese anywhere to be found on my salad which was $10 from the appetizer and the most expensive ingredient was nowhere to be found. For dinner I ordered the Involtini di Pollo the first piece I tried to cut was hard as  rubber. It tasted like very distinct freezer burn after taste every single bite! Lord knows how long it was sitting in a refrigerator getting more stale and they took it out and put it in the oven and put it on my plate like it was freshly made. And lastly they gave us the dessert menu and  the menu had Napoleon, when we tried to order it the waiter said, \"we don't have that anymore.\" And I said well it's on the menu and he said, *we haven't had that dessert in a really long time here.\", so I said then why didn't you take it off the menu already? Seriously, take a black Sharpie and just cross it out. I've seen restaurants do it, if you don't want to invest in reprinting a new menu. Ironically when you look at the menu online it's a tad bit different, for instance my salad shows that it's $9 and it only has arugula and walnuts, but in the actual restaurant menu showed arugula walnuts and goat cheese and it was for $10 pretty expensive for a salad especially when not one stitch of goat cheese was anywhere in my salad. So I have to say I'm very disappointed as well as my husband because he didn't enjoy his chicken cutlet Parmesan dinner either. It still has that cozy feel and the waiter was very accommodating it's just their food and their menu was a very big disappointment.",

I think this is some of the best Italian food regardless of cost (although it is at a very reasonable price).  The portions are generous and the staff will make great suggestions for your taste.  I had the spinach ravioli with vodka sauce and it was absolutely delicious. It wasn't too heavy on the cream and the ravioli was cooked to perfection with a tiny bit al dente chewy to it.  It all mingled very nicely in my mouth and left me completely satisfied.  The only thing was that the wine was a little crappy. I'd suggest cracking open a bottle instead of getting the individual $5 glasses.  Call me old fashion, but you gotta have a good wine pairing with Italian food.  I will definitely be back here to try some more things on the menu. A repeated dining experience and food quality will bump this to a five-star rating. I would highly suggest dropping by if you're in the area.",

Out came the homemade whole wheat bread that was fresh and warm. The service was so nice, as my fiance and I get into deep conversations over dinner, they service didn't linger yet our cups never hit bottom, and they took great care of us. Then, the FOOD. My fiance got the lasagna ( a true test of Italian we like to say ) and I did the Penne Alla Vodka. Homemade sauces that electrify your taste buds. Perfect. No other word.
