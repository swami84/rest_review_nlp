They ask for your feedback, before it's not too late to remedy, if there's anything at all wrong (and there never is).

We were greeted by a very friendly staff and we were seated promptly by outside where we were given the option which was also beautiful and romantic. My girlfriend had the Osso buco which was delicious and I had the filet which was perfectly done. The staff was on point everyone was very friendly and attentive and we couldn't have asked for better service. Irene's never disappoints and is always consistently delicious.I would recommend Irene's to anyone who's looking for a really fantastic experience and meal!",

Called, made a reservation for 6:45pm, the gentleman on the phone was very nice and made the reservation for us and wished us a great evening and see you soon :) which was very nice. We arrive d on time and were greeted by Orlando the nice server who works there for more than 10 years. He was friendly and very welcoming. Then he gave us a table for two in a lovely side, our table served was Michael also a very nice and polite server. We had escargot with mushrooms, mussels in red sauce and duck meat. I would give 10 stars. For me the service is first thing I look at - I want to be treated as people are supposed to when they go to restaurant. There is nothing more I want to write besides - Thanking for great experience and food. Highly recommend",

Daniel the waiter first started off with unprofessional remarks about one of the women at our table. He then went on to make rude statements about even the smallest of things that we did, such as bringing our wine glass closer to him (to make his job easier).  Halfway through dinner our candle was out of wax so we asked our waiter Daniel to get us a new one, which he replied \u201cI can\u2019t fix everything buddy\u201d and never replaced our candle the rest of the night. Then the worst part of the night happened. One of our party members attempted to switch one of the smaller candles from another table, but our waiter Daniel noticed and asked him \u201cWhat\u2019s your name.\u201d and then proceeded to yell out to the entire wing of the restaurant that our party member \u201c...wants to take everyone\u2019s candles! Everyone give him your candles!\u201d  This public shaming went on for a good 2 minutes and included the entire wing of the restaurant laughing at us, with the table next to us (a group of regulars) turning on their iPhone flashlights, pointing them at us and saying \u201chere\u2019s some light for you.\u201d  This wasn\u2019t even the full extent of our horrible experience, Daniel continued to be rude almost every time he returned to our table.

The food isn't anything other than amazing (Lamb and the Beef Tenderloin special). Lastly, they went the extra mile in bringing over a special birthday dessert for my partner in crime.  From the host, to the servers, to the outdoor ambience, and finally to the meal. Nothing but 5 star quality.  Thank you for the amazing experience.",

The patio seating with it's garden was also lovely.  I ordered the Mussels Marinara.  The mussels were the tiniest I have ever seen, but the broth was very good and after the mussels there was plenty of broth to dip the grilled bread in.  I ordered the lamb chops, which were good, but slightly overdone.  The garlic potatoes were a large mound and dense rather than fluffy.  The special of the evening was a filet with crab \"ravioli\" and a red wine demi glace.  The \"ravioli\" were actually crepes and not pasta.  Not very good and should have been noted as such.  Dessert was the hazelnut chocolate truffle, a very rich dessert, but marred by the use of whipped topping instead of real whipped cream.  I would rather have no topping than fake whipped cream.  Service was good, the atmosphere was very pleasing, but the food was a little underwhelming.",

I had skipped lunch, so we went a bit crazy with the food. Had the escargot, the corn and crab bisque, and the lamb.  The escargot isn't just a couple swimming in butter, but are inside a puff pastry, which is inside a mushroom cap and baked. It has a beurre blanc sauce that is awesome. A+++  The soup was an awesome corn and crab bisque. It was thick, almost like a stew, and had a great flavorful. Just a great filler on a rainy night.  The lamb was fairly standard but exceptionally well executed. Medium rare, with a dark, viscous demi glace on fresh garlic mashed potatoes. What could be wrong with that?  Finally we ended with banana's Foster bread pudding. Not too heavy, and just sweet enough to finish off the richness of the meal.  Great food!",

But the night we were there the service level was way off. Our waiter was very professional but the amount of time to get our food took over an hour after we ordered. It was just my wife and myself in a nice but small room with three other tables. Each of those tables had 4+ people. A table of 7 were seated about 10 minutes after us. I know we ordered before they did. They received their food well before we did. Also, we noticed each of the tables were offered a complimentary liquor drink towards the end of their meal. Not that big of deal, but we weren\u2019t offered anything. With the amount of restaurants in New Orleans in that area I can\u2019t say that we will be back.",

The food was equally superb. We started with the oysters Irene and an appetizer that was on special, the fried soft shell crab. The oysters were fresh, tasty and unique compared to the usual chargrilled oysters found in new orleans. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection and well seasoned. For our entre's we had the fish and the lamb. Both cooked to perfection. The lamb was exceptional, and the demiglaze didn't overpower the lamb, complimenting it perfectly. Her fish was outstanding, and the sweet potatoes were amazing. For dessert we had the creme broulee... I do not have a sweet tooth. The creme broulee wasn't too sweet and very enjoyable. Accompanying the meal we both had an imported Italian beer. The pilsner and the bock. The bock was AMAZING. we both highly recommend this place for a date. They bring fresh flowers and candle light to each table.",

From the pictures I thought the place was kind of casual, however, we were pleasantly surprised to find a much elegant restaurant. We tried the lasagna and the mussels, both great.  The LASAGNA was a solid dish. I wouldn\u2019t say it was the best, but it was a good dish. The MUSSELS come with a heavy red marinara sauce. In my experience, Italians typically prepare this dish in a white wine / butter/ garlic sauce. This is not the case, but the mussels are delicious nevertheless.  The staff is friendly and kind. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

The side of potatoes au gratin and sauce were fabulous as well. The wine list was excellent and included a wide selection of American and European wines at various prices. Additionally, our waiter, Darius, was once of the nicest and most sincere servers ever. He was amazingly helpful and friendly and boosted the meal to be one of my best ever. This is THE restaurant you need to eat at in one of America's great food cities.",

Unfortunately, the experience was less than pleasant. I specifically asked that my regular waiter Dan waite on us, but the Manager Orlando purposely gave us Juan as our waiter, who seem to be less then competent to do the job. He was extremely absent and when he finally came around he managed to get our order wrong. We had to ask the bus boy Ricky twice to have Juan come to our table, which prove to be a futile effort. I brought it to the Orlando's attention but he basically smiled and dismissed it, by telling me to go back to my table. I asked to speak to the owner Irene, to which Orlando said she would be by our table. We waited 25 minutes and she never did show. My past experience had been wonderful, but their service and management has diminished dramatically. If you like overpriced good cuisine with losey service, you will love this place!",

Sent back again.   Medium means warm pink center.  Not bloody and cold in the center.   When brought back I would have thought they\u2019d serve a new steak that wasn\u2019t cut into 3 or 4 pieces.  Not what I\u2019d expect from a high end restaurant.  Very disappointed.  Was given sorbet complimentary.  But the damage was done.  Will not return.  The chef needs to invest in a meat thermometer.",

My waiter also paired us both with exceptional wine to match each dish. It was a wonderful experience, and every time I come back to New Orleans I will 100% come back to have dinner here.

Arrived on time for our reservation and directed to bar to wait. Nice bar, quick service, well crafted cocktails. Seated for dinner in a small side room with six tables. All had 6 people at essentially four tops. We were literally back to back with the tables on either side of us. You had to politely ask your neighbor to move if you needed to get up from the table Greeted by our server, Juan. Great guy working his butt off. Was not rushed with us. Took our dinner cocktail orders and our early wine order. Great drinks. had a couple of bottles of a delicius Amarone Shared appetizers, salads and entrees were delicious. No complaints. Steak specials temps were perfect Outstanding service, food, and restaurant with terrible seating for us and those around us. Highly recommended Just watch the size of your group and where you are seated so you can enjoy the delicious food Slainte",

Wine list is excellent, even though we went with a Lambrusco. On top of it all, we were one of the last seatings of the night (ca. 10 pm) and there was perfect professionalism all the way around. Last detail I'll add is the atmosphere here is great and what I'd call quite Nola: wood panelling, dark, low light, rich woods, very cool.",

However the folks at Irene\u2019s exceeded any expectations and definitely went above and beyond.  My husband, 10 month old son, mother, niece, nephew, and I had dinner there last night and it is by far the best meal we have had in a long time!  The food (between the five adults we sampled most of the menu) was delicious and made it to the table in record time.  But more importantly they were so welcoming and accommodating of my son.  As soon as we walked through the door everyone smiled, said hello and welcome.  I don\u2019t shy from taking my son to a nice restaurant because he is a good baby and I am usually prepared to deal with any of his needs.  But the servers were all so kind to him.  They all spoke to him, asked if he wanted or needed anything and Ms. Denise even brought him orange slices without us asking.  Dessert was amazing too, i has the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it might be the best one I\u2019ve had outside of Paris.  It was smooth, creamy, and perfectly caramalized.  I will definitely be recommending Irene\u2019s to anyone visiting NOLA!",

Our server Michael was perfectly genuine, funny and incredibly knowledgeable about everything on the menu. The food was very good, except for our filets which consisted mainly of chewy gristle. The mushroom dressing was also a little too salty for my liking but I enjoyed the bruschetta, potato leek soup, and potato au gratin. Their wine selection is extensive, we had a sweet merlot with the lovliest bouquet from start to finish. I totally recommend the food and impeccable service at Irene's.",

This being our first night in New Orleans, we had wandered around looking for somewhere to eat, so seeing the name we knew it had to be a sign! We stood outside, listening to the nice music wafting out and beckoning us in. Without a reservation we expected to wait, but they found us somewhere immediately. We arrived at seven but within an hour the place was rammed full. The menu looked good and it was hard to choose what to eat. Coming from London we didn\u2019t find the prices unreasonable, especially as the food was superb. Top marks. The wine list was comprehensive and reasonable too. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Irene\u2019s has a welcoming atmosphere and all the busy waiters had a smile or nod of recognition for us. Being picky, the air con was a tad too strong where we were sitting, especially if sitting underneath, but aside from that, the place is great. Thoroughly recommended.",

The restaurant is slightly upscale - probably wouldn\u2019t wear shorts in there.",
