Today, I discovered that they changed the recipe. Without warning. It is now made with one piece of the tempeh (as opposed to the handful they provided previously), and deep fried onion rings (which incidentally I happen to loath). It also no longer comes with a side. The price, has not changed accordingly. When I called to ask about it, they said they had no intention to change the recipe back to the original, and I would have to call grubhub for any kind of compensation. Even though the mistake was neither theirs nor mine. I understand that restaurants are struggling now, but if they're going to change the recipe, they should provide some clue to that effect. And when a loyal customer says something, the onus should not be on them to try to recoup the associated funds.",

I had to practice self control in order to take a picture. Seriously, 10000/10 experience. Don't just walk by this place - hop in for a quick drink or sit down for dinner as often as possible, cus it's truly a treat.",

Got to the restaurant just before the happy hour ended & ordered a margarita. The drink was just ok. I did appreciate that it was not sweet but it was missing flavor. Now on to the main event.....Nachos & Quesadillas. Nachos were very fresh. I would love it if the tortillas chips were baked instead of fried. The vegan cheese & beans, salsa & guacamole were all great. The quesadillas were equally great. Looks like the use Ezekiel type tortillas & it definitely feels  like you're eating healthier. The filling was good & i liked that the plantains inside didn't make it taste sweet. I would like the food to have a little kick....maybe option of fresh jalapenos would be nice. For dessert it was the Brownie Sundae. I was not so impressed but my son devourered it. What kid doesn't like sugar? That's why I am writing this review...lol. For me the brownie was too gooey & I've had much better vegan ice cream. I find the not so good vegan versions of desserts always contain too much sugar. This wasn't the case here but flavor & texture were missing. Overall it was good food experience & I recommend dining here for a good vegan meal.",

It comes with a salad although once they didn't give it to me - so make sure you ask and get your included side salad . It's not cheap in general but flavorful and made with love. Can also be a little loud sometimes. I love Latin music but salsa music it's not very zen. Sometimes I want more of chill vibes when I'm eating. Overall I like this place a lot.",

It had no depth of flavor, well no flavor at all. It didn't taste like they used any salt or pepper. The empanadas I had were Philly cheese steak and the Jamaican. The Philly cheese steak taste like nothing, the Jamaican only tasted spicy but it had no specific flavor profile. Once we finished the appetizer the server brought out the entree yet left the dirty appetizer plate on the table. She never asked if we were ok, or if we needed anything. I made a mistake with the drink order. She scolded me for my mistake. I waited about 25 mins for her to bring my new drink. She apologized for the wait but it seemed forced, not sincere. The kale ceasar had about 10% kale and 90 % romaine. The ceasar salad dressing tasted like nothing. The salad came with huge red onions on top that would be very awkward to try to eat on a date. The tempeh saved the salad because it was salty therefore it gave it flavor. My boyfriends sandwich tasted like nothing and it was dry! They had housemade salsa on the table. I put it on my food to spice it up a bit and I couldn't believe the salsa also tasted like nothing! The nachos and buffalo wings were good. Everything else needed at bare minimum SALT AND PEPPER! I was really looking forward to eating here and I was very disappointed in the food and even more in the service. If you want food that taste like water I would recommend going here.",

I tried the empanadas (Colombian, red bean and Jamaican), the hubby ordered the lasagna, salad and garlic bread and I had la Bandeja Paisa and was very satisfied with my order. Just like the traditional Colombian version it was made to model it had so much and was very satisfying. The place is small but spacious enough to eat comfortably and without having to be cluttered unlike some of the other vegan restaurants I've visited in the city. The drinks here are decent. The margarita was strong, and the red wine was pretty good, and if you get lucky and catch it during happy hour you're looking at $5-$6 a glass. I recommend it to all vegans looking to get a Latin inspired meal. Price wise I'd give it $$-$$$  out of 5. Enjoy!!!\ud83e\udd17",

After feigning all day for some wings I arrived at at the restaurant at 4:50. Was quickly reminded that the restaurant would not be opened today until 5pm but I could wait inside while they get ready. Shortly thereafter a young lady approached me to say I should wait at the coffee shop down the block. She added that there were other vegan restaurants in the area that I could go to. WOW.  About five minutes later the gentleman who initially invited me to stay told me they would not be ready for another 30 minutes. I waited outside only to see him locking the door with the keys each time one of the staff exited or re-entered. After 30 minutes of waiting I gave up very disappointed to say the least.  I will not be back.",

I usually tip even for takeout and decided against it. Once I got my order from one guy he handed me my receipt to sign and walked away. I tried giving the same female employee (because she was the only one in front of me) the receipt and she didn't even say please come against, thanks for your service or anything that would make me feel comfortable coming back to this restaurant. Its pretty sad and I honestly don't want to make it a race thing because I was only in there for 5 minutes but i was the only black person in there at the moment. I won't ever go back there. The empanadas were good but the burrito wasn't. The good amount of nachos that they gave only came with 2 small tablespoon size serving of salsa. If I could give a 0 I would. A vegan restaurant should be people friendly also sad!",

The food (when they aren't screwing up the order) is actually very good (a bit expensive but tasty). I just cannot get over how bad the customer service is here. Different staff over the years and down the line are just awful save maybe one or two waitresses/managers who are no longer there. Over half the time they screw up the order whether it is the wrong item altogether or a missing ingredient. The last time I went they gave me a chicken cutlet sandwich instead of chicken parm sandwich. This happens ALL THE TIME. 2 similar sounding items on the menu, sure but you would think if they work there, they know the difference. Sent it back. Portabella salad next and it was missing the pecans and the cashew cheese. The waiter tried to tell me those are extra items you have to request. No they are not. I showed him the menu. Instead of arguing with the customer, try apologizing! When I asked him, what do you expect me to do, pay full price for something missing 2 ingredients? He said well we can make you a new one or you can go somewhere else. I left and won't be back. Mind you, I am someone who has gone there for years dropping anywhere from 50-100 dollars a month in this place. I have put up with the consistently bad service because I do like their food and want to support 100% vegan places but enough is enough. A new vegan place opened down the block from them.

It was so nice to be able to enjoy a good vegan burger, and they were very catering to my wife and I's gluten intolerance. Their jalapeno margarita is worth every penny, and don't even get me started on dessert! So often, vegan desserts sound delicious on the menu, but end up tasting less than sub-par. This was not the case at all with desserts at vspot! I had the pistachio ice cream (my favorite flavor of ice cream, that I have not been able to have since becoming Vegan over a year ago!) Which was mouthwatering, my friend had the warm peanut butter brownie, and another friend had the strawberry cheesecake(which was hands down the greatest vegan cheesecake any of us have ever had). We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Brooklyn!",

That wouldn't be too bad if it was busy, but there were several open tables, and the waiters frequently stood around to chat. It could go 20+ minutes without the waiter stopping by. We had to flag them down to order, get more water, get the check, and give them the check? Icing on the cake? There was a 20% gratuity automatically applied. I understand people do this with groups, but a 5 top? That's not normal, and it was not stated on the menu. That all being said, the food was fantastic, so if they just had a wait staff who remotely cared, it'd be a 5 star no question.",

This has happened to me on two occasions far as the to go thing. At times i understand there short staffed, but i dont mind to wait. But why aim at kicking a guest out rather than communicating clearly? Especially with someone thats a regular and work in the area. So unprofessional. And this from the manager. Smh",

Food *** The homemade tortilla chips are very good and one the more unique we\u2019ve had. However, the salsa they provide is in a very small holder for it (and very small amount), making it difficult to apply the salsa to the chips. We got the Chipotle burrito and the VSPOT burrito. The VSPOT burrito came to the table lukewarm, while the Chipotle burrito was heated properly as observed by the steam that came out when opened. I enjoyed my Chipotle burrito but my partner was not a fan of the VSPOT.  Atmosphere **** Lively, popular, and intimate all at the same time. They definitely did well here. The only thing keeping it from five stars is the square footage of the space and there could be some improvements to the interior.  Service *** Overall not bad, but the waiters switched in the midst of our dining experience and we were not informed. However, food was served at a reasonable time and a bottle of water provided to the table (definitely a star in itself)!  Price $$ Reasonably priced food.  We won\u2019t give up on VSPOT and will probably check it out for brunch since we\u2019ve read that their brunches are pretty amazing!",
