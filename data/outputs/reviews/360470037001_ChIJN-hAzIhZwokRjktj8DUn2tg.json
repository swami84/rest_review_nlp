It needed a bit more cream, it was a little on the drier side.  Small seating area infront of the windows and a bench on the wall.  This place is tiny, but I liked their packaging when you take it to go. Almost like eating a burrito, and you peel the wrapper as you go down chopping on the crepe.  They accept all major credit cards, you swipe sign your name on their ipads.  I would prefer them having some hand sanitizer next to their counter because everyone probably touched that ipad with their dirty fingers..then you have to eat your awesome crepe with a fork...I sometimes prefer my fingers for those crucial moments when needed.",

I had to Harajuku Fruit Cocktail and loved it! The crepe itself was crisp and the fruits were ripe. The almond slices were w great touch and the custard was sweet.  The yozosoda was also great! Full of citrus and nicely chilled! I wish they would offer it in hot tea form for the upcoming winter weather though.",

Either location you visit is delicious, although the NYC branch uses rice flour instead of regular flour (because Americans think gluten is bad - hint, it's not).  That being said, the crepes are delicious. I enjoyed the kurubota sausage crepe, and nearly walked back in for a sweet crepe right afterwards. Try 8 Turn. You won't be disappointed.",

I had the matcha stripe chocolate crepe and the strawberry plus chocolate chunks plus thin wrapper worked together harmoniously.  The wrapping of the crepe is also very innovative.  They fold it up into a cone shape and wrap paper around it so you can hold it and eat it like an ice cream cone almost.  The paper is perforated so that as you eat, you can keep peeling the paper away in a neat and orderly fashion.  The yuzu lemonade, which was being offered as a free promotion when I went, was also really tasty and reminded me of a normal lemonade with an extra citrus burst.  The service here was only so so though.  The person taking our orders was a little brusque and rough around the edges.  Also, they were doing a buy one crepe get one yuzu lemonade free promotion, and when they forgot to give us our lemonades, I asked for mine only to be greeted with a look and tone of suspicion.  Thoroughly off putting.  Also, if you plan on coming with a group for brunch, you might have to take it to the park across the street to eat as the place does not have any place to sit.  I would certainly come back to this place for the crepes as I feel the taste alone has merited that.  Just don't expect to stellar service.",

They\u2019ve managed to take traditional crepes and turned them into cones that one can eat on the go, similar to how one would eat an ice cream cone. It works out wonderfully and the choices are as vast as one would find at any traditional creperie, such as Vive le Crepe. The first outpost is in NoLita, right when you exit the 6 train on Spring Street. It is a little spot with minimal seating by the windows and the majority of the space dedicated to the kitchen. The windows feature full on display cones showing the various types they offer to any passersby, from the sweet to the savory. On the right hand side of that inside the shop are LCD screens depicting the origins of the location, Japanese girls eating crepe cones, as well as delectable visuals of the insides of these cones and their ingredients. The menu is displayed atop, as well as a portable menu on the counter so you can make your pick. The entire place seems to be digitized and you order you sign for your card by finger on a tablet, just like most small businesses in the city are starting to do these days. Now unto the food. They\u2019re really good and they are worth the price. They are comparable to other crepe locations and at times even cheaper. However, they are just as filling and look just as pretty, as evidenced by the pictures in this post. I\u2019ve been there twice already and the strawberry banana is my favorite. They have a plethora of fruit flavors and savory ones that include turkey or ham with lettuce. I haven\u2019t tried them but they look really good. I recommend you stop by as soon as possible as everyone was asking where we got it from when we were eating them on the train, so I expect the place to be swarmed soon.",
