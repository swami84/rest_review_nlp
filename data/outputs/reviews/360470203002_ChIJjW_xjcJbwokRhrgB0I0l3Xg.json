So it is with Leland etc., etc. We were just searching for a new, local restaurant with outside dining (due to covid). But we somehow managed to score one of this restaurant's two outside, self-contained dining pods. It's like... eating at home except with you own chef and servers... my kind of set-up.  Anyway, loved eating outside/but not truly outside, on a nice, non-busy residential street. The music in our pod was great, the service was excellent, the cocktails were decent (a bit sweet but very balanced), they had delicious wines by the glass, but the food...  The food, man... you can always tell when a chef just knows how to \"burn\". These guys are the real deal- you can teach technique, but you can't teach a great palate.  OK, OK... the food.  We started off with the smoked pollock fritters and the focaccia. Those fritters- when I saw them I was like, \"man, I hope those taste as good as they look.\" They effin' did! A glorius combination of flavors complemented by a tzatziki sauce with fresh chunks of cucumber. The dish was like magic.  \"But was that all?\" you ask. Not by a long shot. They didn't have the chicken jook which is what we really wanted, so we skipped the \"plates\" and went straight for their entrees...  Of which we had all three (don't judge)... So, in order of wonderful to wonderful:  We started off with a whole fish. I know this isn't for everyone because it requires a bit of work. But this fish was made special by an excellent fennel salad which went so well with the fish we were fighting over the last bite.  Next was the \"pork and beans\". I don't know what kind of pork that was but if it were here right now I'd marry it (then eat it- so much for love). The gigante beans in what tasted like a spicy paprika oil was the perfect combination.  And finally, the chicken. If you know me you know I love roast chicken. This would be the second best roast chicken I've had in the last few years. Out of all the dishes this one was the most special.  We finished our dinner off by having the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e pie. Sweet, light- the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  This was the best meal we've had in NYC in months. Try it before the hype becomes too real and the reservation too impossible...",

        "caption": "Fantastic experience. Every single menu item was delicious and bursting with powerful flavors. The reviews didn\u2019t let this place down, and i\u2019m glad we came! This is a boutique style restaurant, so you\u2019re going to have a heavy gluten free and vegetarian favoring menu, with a lot of homemade items. With that comes a slightly heavier price point and smaller portions, but it\u2019s worth checking it out! The drinks were delicious as well, and the employees made us feel at home!  Food: 10/10 Where do I start. The pollok fritters were very tasty, the perfect mix of many flavors of smokiness, fish, and bringing it together with the tzatziki sauce, in a fluffy hush puppy style ball. The eggplant was ridiculously good, but the brussel sprouts stole the show. I didn\u2019t think ever in my life I\u2019d say that brussel sprouts would be the best thing i had that evening, but here we are. Delicious and loaded with flavor. The chicken was surprisingly good but nothing life changing. The pork and beans was also a solid dish but also nothing to write home about for me. Every dish was unique, and had strong flavor, something that I personally value very heavily (even if it means being a little salty or saucy). I really don\u2019t think you can go wrong with any menu item here at this place. Everything was cooked to perfection, and I couldn\u2019t find any critiques.  Menu: As aforementioned, it\u2019s a heavy gluten free and especially vegetarian style menu. You couldn\u2019t tell any of these items were lacking gluten if you tried, so that was irrelevant. The limited amount of protein and or meat options was a little lackluster for me personally, but the amazing quality of the brussel sprouts make up for that entirely. The menu is fairly balanced though, so I feel that there are still options for everyone. The dishes are made to be shared which allows skeptical eaters to get their mouths full of trying something new.  Value: 3/5 Like any boutique style restaurant, expect to pay a little too much for small portions of vegetables. We split 4 small plates and 2 big plates, along with 6 drinks for a little over $200. I think that\u2019s a fair price for $50 a person, however, i\u2019ll note that i stopped and grabbed two tacos on the way home. With that being said, i\u2019ve been to several boutique restaurants in the area and have paid more for lower quality, which is why ill give the value a fair rating.  Experience: 5/5 It\u2019s a remodeled place, everything is chic, modern, but most importantly cozy! It doesn\u2019t have a packed restaurant layout which makes it feel much more at home. Every seating arrangement seems to be unique compared to the one next to it. I found the tables intimate but open. I was very comfortable throughout my entire experience. The service was fantastic for the entire night. We were treated very hospitality the moment we walked through the door and while we were being taken care of. The server was very patient, and took her time to explain in great detail many of the menu items.  Closing words, this place is fantastic top to bottom. As always, the drinks aren\u2019t rated but the mexican hot chocolate is ridiculously tasty! Trust me, just order it.",

I wish Vinyl Hour offered more in the way of vegan options but the focaccia sandwich was DELICIOUS. As we\u2019re the homemade chips! For only having one offering they really nailed it. I hope to try more if they offer additional vegan friendly menu items down the line! Great neighborhood spot.",

I have never tried something more delicious, or comforting, perfect on a cold NY winter night, you MUST get the Jook when you visit. Mandatory.  To-go we ordered the Pork and Beans (amazing!), the Brussels and the Carrots. I loved the smaller sides and options as appetizers. When I got home, I quickly plated everything and enjoyed a meal as if I was sitting at their lovely restaurant.  I can't wait to come back once indoor dining re-opens, the space is clean and classic. They offer a great variety of drinks, wines and bites. Can't wait to come back soon!",

Food: We ordered: Roasted Squash Fritto Misto Spiced Carrots Pan Seared Scallops Fisherman's Stew  Highly recommend the Fritto misto, spiced carrots (most impressive carrot dish I have ever eaten), and pan seared scallops!  Drinks: The French pressed coffee was the best I've ever had, goes great with their pie desserts (get extra whipped cream on top)!  Definitely coming back to try the rest of their dishes!",
