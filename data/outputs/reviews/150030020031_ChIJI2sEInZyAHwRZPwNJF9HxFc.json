Food was OK. Nothing special outside a typical suburban Mexican style restaurant. Spicing was bland compared to what I normally see around the Southern US. Corn tortillas needed to be warmed more in my humble opinion. Like a typical Chipotle seasoning palate. Probably just what a typical tourist for this area wants.  Good portions though, and they put exactly what you ask for and as much as you want on your item. Fish portions grilled are small and another customer ordered deep fried. That piece was much larger. Something to keep in mind.  Saw another post about the fries and they were piled on nicely. Good post bar food.",

After you pick what you want example: shrimp tacos, you then get to choose what toppings and sauce you want on them.  Very similar to like a Qdoba/Chiptle but a hundred times more tasty. Taro tortillas wraps are a must,  I wish I could get these in Michigan. Thanks again guys and I look forwarding to returning wherever I get back to Hawaii. Mahalo \ud83e\udd19",

There were two people working there and they both seemed annoyed that we were there and the one taking our order basically glared at us the whole time. Ordered the steak and shrimp tempura tacos. They are not terrible, but I would say extremely mediocre at best, and crazy overpriced at about 11 bucks for two tacos. Place looks like just a tourist trap with a terrible work environment based on how unhappy the staff seemed. Would definitely not recommend.",

They had no line and only two people eating there. When I ordered there was only one employee, he was really nice. He gave me to try a taro tortilla, which I found really tasty. I ordered two shrimp tacos with such tortilla and two fish tacos with regular corn tortillas.  The tacos were really big and I was full with only two of them. I didn't really know how they made it there, so I asked him to put a little of everything.  Here is what I found out from my visit.  Pros: Large sizes, enough to fill you up. Good value Really friendly staff Great location  Cons: A bit of a slow service Pico de gallo tasted a bit off. I think the tomatoes weren't fresh. When I ordered a little of everything as toppings I should have been warned the guacamole was an extra charge. I was charged around $1.75 for a table spoon worth of guacamole. Improper hygiene. Employee put on some gloves prior to handling food without previously handwashing. In the middle of food preparation he touched a tablet to change music, then failed to change gloves.  Were the tacos good? They weren't bad, I would say next time I go, I'll probably be selective with my toppings. I'll probably give this place a second change if I'm around the area. However, I wasn't impressed. They okay, nothing to love.",

You won't go broke here for lunch or dinner. Three people, two burritos, and one fish taco dish was less than $25.00. This is almost unheard of for downtown Honolulu.

Originally my brother recommended me to this place, and now I'm recommending it to all of you. Here is my breakdown:  +1 Star: The price. The price is amazing here and you get such a wide variety of tacos.  +1 Star: Convenience. If you are located in the downtown area of Waikiki, this place is right slap in the middle and off of a main bus line.  +1 Star: Food. The food is awesome, and has a wide variety of selection. I was never disappointed with what I got here.  +1 Star: Service is awesome. Personable staff who recommended hikes and things to do. Also very fast service.  +1 Star: Environment is tasteful. The interior is well made and is well put together. You can meet people here - I had a good conversation about cameras with another couple.  Would I go back? 100% yes - this place is awesome and is literally a gem when it comes to food and pricing.",
