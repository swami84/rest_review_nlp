We ordered some cocktails. I got the Rif, which is the bartender's creation of the day. It was a take on a whiskey sour and was boozy and delicious! My fiance ordered the Chai cocktail which tasted pretty similar to mine. I didn't get a lot of chai flavor. They pushed some tables together for our rowdy group of 6. The waitress was extremely patient with us and was willing to chat and laugh with us. She made our experience even better! She suggested two plates per person, I would suggest one small plate and one solo dish per person. Thankfully, no one was super hungry because these plates are small! We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the braised quail, the Israeli couscous, the fish tacos, shrimp tempura, and pommes frites. The couscous was so amazing!! I'm going to try to make it myself. The dates, pommes frites, and tacos were great. The braised quail was small but the jambalaya was good. And the shrimp tempura was more like popcorn shrimp. Would skip that one next time. The musicicians were a quiet piano soloist and a duo. We were overpowering them with our talking (sorry!) and they didn't really add to the ambiance. The food and drinks were delicious and the place was cozy. Better for a date night or quiet night for a couple rather than a rowdy group like we were.",

I also chose the roasted Brussel sprouts done in an \u201cAsian style\u201d with crunchy sesame. They came in a sweet and sour sauce with broken uncooked instant ramen noodles on top. I\u2019m guessing the chef was on acid to try to pass that off. Never been a fan of uncooked instant noodles sprinkled over my sprouts. My friend ordered the cous cous which was under mains and sounded tasty.  But she said it just was plain cous cous with hardly anything added to it. Cocktails were nice.

Don't go without a reservation, especially  on a Friday/Saturday. I dont why there are bad reviews, I guess people don't get out much or have never been to a tapas bar before... The food was outstanding, my service was awesome even being there so late. The music vibe was incredible, and a gentlemen even came in off the street and joined the house musician and it was so whimsical. My most memorable place from this trip. I thought everything was priced accordingly. We had the Pommes Frites, the tempura shrimp, braised meatballs, grilled lamb and a special item I can't remember the name. Amazing.

Atmosphere was laid back and energetic all at the same time. Piano music was superb! Hostess could have not been so snobby. We were there quite early -only one other table had a customer- and she tried seating us behind a pole. She didn't like it when we asked for a table closer to a window. She then said we had to be done in an hour and a half.  Even with a relaxed meal and  quality listening to music we left with a few minutes to spare. The couple that was seated before us was still there and we never heard her mention the time limit to anyone else. Overall I would recommend a visit!",

        "caption": "While in New Orleans on business, I was enjoying all the fantastic live music on Frenchman street. I spent hours going in and out of nearly every establishment.  My experience at the Three Muses deserves mention.  I travel for work and I am in sales.  I speak with strangers easily and make friends everywhere I go.  Which I why this story is so amazing to me. Upon entering this place I noted the amount of people in the Three Muses was very low, maybe 15 people total on a very busy night.  Being alone, I walked up to the bar and ordered a drink.  When I receiving the drink, I took a sip and remarked to the bartender that the drink was great, she said \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d  Hmm, I thought.  Odd response. I turned to the music, as the band was very good.  When the person next to me ordered a drink, I noted some ingredients that I like and asked this same bartender what the drink was called, she glared at me saying nothing.  I thought she could not hear me, so I asked again.  She reached down, grabbed a drink menu and tossed it at me.  I was shocked.  I was trying to imagine what I could have done to make this woman so unkind towards me.  I looked at the younger bartender, that Miss Happy was clearly training and she rolled her eyes at me.  As if to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know why this Manager/Bartender is being so mean to you but I am sorry\u201d  We all know the look.  The young bartender even went so far as to let me try some of the new drinks she was learning, when Miss Happy walked away.  When the Mean employee returned however, she quickly moved away from me and stopped speaking.  The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was this-  As I was quickly drinking my one and only drink, I asked very nicely \u201cSweet heart, could you please give me a glass of water, when it is Convenient\u201d  To which she said \u201cDid you just call me Sweetie?\u201d  I responded, I was simply trying to be nice, I am from Texas.  I was being sincere.  The water never came.  I paid my bill and began to leave.  When I asked about the water she stated with a stern look in her eyes.  \u201cYou said \u2018when it was convenient\u201c and then sneered at me. Upon leaving, I could not find one single employee who would tell me Miss Happy\u2019s name.  I have never been in a restaurant or bar in my life where every employee was in fear of revealing a person\u2019s name.  They all said things like \u201cWhy not ask her?\u201d  \u201cWhy do you need to know?\u201d  Clearly, this happens all the time and they cover for her.  Therefore, I will kindly describe the bartender who is scaring all your customers away.  She is a heavyset blonde-haired woman, with pale skin and tattoos up and down both arms.  If you own the Three Muses and you are wondering why your sales numbers do not compare to the other bars on Frenchman, she is working at your bar.  I will never come back here and will recommend people avoid this place.  Your entire staff knows this is occurring, regularly, and they are enabling this person.  It is clear she needs therapy and should not be customer facing.  As a Christian, I will pray for her, she needs it.",

Finally the wench comes over and takes us to our table which had been vacant the whole time we were there. Sat there for 25 minutes and listened to a mediocre band. Still NO SERVICE, Got up and left, told the wench outside that we were leaving and told her why, she just waved her hand and said OK, whatever or something like that. We went to Snug Harbor and were treated very well. Had the best Gumbo I've had in awhile.  3 Muses=Don't GO, waste of your time. Question for the owner: Is this really the type of restaurant/bar/music you want to present, if not, FIX IT. The customer service is terrible. I got better service at an over-crowded bar on Bourbon St at 10:00pm on a Saturday night. 3 Muses is a joke.",

Like others have said, the music was fantastic, and at a level that allowed you to still talk with your table. The servers were extremely sweet and accommodating, and the food was great. We came here after dinner so we kept it small with only the fries and peanut butter pie, but both were great.  I tried an Earl Gray Tea drink that I didn't love but probably because it was strong, so at least you know they are generous.  We had a great time!",

The table I was at ordered the stuffed dates, fish tacos, mac and cheese, and steal frites. Everything was outstanding. Tender, delicious steak cooked to perfection. Mac and cheese that blew our collective minds, and the fish tacos that were flavorful and flaky. We had the peanut butter pie, which was also amazing.  Drinks were also terrific. Outstanding local beers I've never tried before, combined with what I can only describe as the best cocktail menu of any small bar I've been to. The muse and earl grey gardens we're absolutely delicious.  Price is a bit steep for portion size. Treat yourself, it's worth it.",

We finished our drinks prior to our meal and so we tried to get the waitresses attention to get another drink for 45 minutes, the runners dropped our plates too quickly for us to mention it to them and when she eventually showed up to clear our table of stacked and empty plates we just asked for the cheque.  I ordered the $15 cheese platter which was an absolute wrought. 3 slices of cheese, 4 small slices of French stick, 4 thin slices of apple, 1 tiny square of p\u00e2t\u00e9 and some nuts. Left me hungrier than I sat down but even if I wanted to order something else there was no way of ordering with no waiter. My partners tempura shrimp was again very small but delicious, he was very happy if a little hungry.  To top it off the Musicians were very lack lustre and bored during the show and pushy regarding tips - \u201c$20 is just if you think we\u2019re okay\u201d, I would have tipped better if they hadn\u2019t been so obnoxious about it. They only played for about 20 minutes for the hour or so we were there and spent a good 5 whinging about how they deserved to be out to dinner on a Saturday night too. I\u2019m an artist, I know it\u2019s rough but you make it work and be grateful for what you\u2019ve got.  Such a shame, we were looking forward to a special night out but this was the opposite.",

This time around though, was put off by the pretentious cartoon of a guy who seated us, making us wait till our reserved time of 10.15, even though there were many tables free at 10. He even let a group of \"white\" folks without reservation go in as well. The food menu also didn't seem too extensive and couple of my friends who were vegetarians didn't really enjoy their food as well. Not going to go back because of that one \"dude\"",
