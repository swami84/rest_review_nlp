It came with lumpia, pancit, chicken adobo, cebu Lechon, ube donuts, and the owner threw in a longanisa scotch egg for free. Everything was cooked perfectly and was seasoned well. You can tell she puts a lot of love into her food. I was pleased with everything we tried. The ube donuts were delicious, just microwave for a few seconds and they are soft and nicely textured without being overly sweet. The owner is lovely, she kept me updated on my order even though it was made last minute, she followed through and even surprised us. I would recommend this place. It\u2019s located in the French Market in the West Loop. Support this excellent small business.",

They tasted just like the ones my mom used to make for me when I was little, but better for me.  The Lugaw I will eat any day from here because Kathy makes it taste that good.  My family used to only make it when someone got the flu or a cold and/or to settle an unruly GI situation.   Now, for me, it is the most comforting thing to eat on a cold grey day.",

From my initial inquiry to planning the menu to execution the day of the birthday party: she was highly communicative, honest, transparent in the process, very thorough and timely in every aspect.  At the party her setup was down to a science, she was upbeat and had a lot of concern for the guests to ensure they were satisfied and happy with the food.  I've also picked up food from her tent at the Daley Plaza Farmers Market during summer, ordered a small catering order for my office and placed a personal order online for Lumpia's and Ube donuts.  Always service with a smile, quality food and fresh!  Definitely cooked with lots of love and attention and you can tell.  I highly recommend her.",
