        "caption": "The menu is pre-set. All courses are determined by the kitchen. There is seating in the back with no reservation requirements; where you can order a la carte but not all plates in the main dining room are available & vice versa. Also detailed descriptions (they are exhaustive) offered almost no insight to the flavors of the dish. I've eaten in both places I had things in the Main dinning room that I just would not have thought to order but turned out to be wonderful. I was also practically bursting in the Main by the end. (Full disclosure; 2 helpings of bread the first to eat: 2nd to throughly clean my plate. Less work for the dishwasher! Your welcome.) So you decide.  Short Review: You ever watch Top Chef & think \"Who do I have to sleep with to be in that dinninroom?\" ME! You have to sleep with me! Or I suppose you could just go here.\u00a0Gourmand,\u00a0 epicurean,\u00a0 if this is you, Eat here NOW! otherwise \"this is not the restaurant your looking for.\" You like big hearty portions, there are many OTHER fine restaurants in the neighborhood. You think food has gotten too pretentious then Nooo! Please keep it moving folks. There is nothing to see here!  Long version: Critiquing dishes is not helpful here because of the constantly changing menu. Everything was Very Good & @ least 3 things were Absolutely Amazing! Even the things I did not particularly care for,\u00a0 like the asparagus were Very Good. At first a little sour but as you got into: just the changes in texture & nuance of flavors were so very interesting. I found a smear of deliciousness hidden under a piece of asparagus that made the last 3 bites the best of the whole plate. These dishes present as a beautiful mosaic but meant to be thoughtfully explored. Every bite is different. Each dish was a work of art; beautiful, delicious & so flipping interesting! For what it is worth: Friday the 13th my favorites were the; octopus, spring stew, lamb, & the dessert",

Drinks sometimes came long before the course they were to be paired with, and once they came before one of us was done with the previous drink. We'd dropped some bread crumbs on the table from the delicious but very crumbly bread early on, and it wasn't cleaned up until 1+ hours later before the final course, which isn't a big issue but not exceptional attention to detail. The $70 food was quite delicious and worth the price, but the $50 beverage pairing was not. The first and last drinks were fairly good, but the rest were overwhelmingly dank ciders and wines. They had only that one note, and it was not only odd tasting but didn't pair well with food. The music was a little too overwhelming and too loud; at times it drifted to calmer music better suited to a nice dinner but invariably drifter back.",

I came here for our anniversary. Unfortunately, I accidentally booked Barroom table which is the back area called A La Carte, garden room. My bad not reading the confirmation for A la carte while I\u2019ve made dining room notification. Cancellation FEE a $30 per person is ABSOLUTELY absurd for the garden room when they don\u2019t serve course menu... plus the garden room was very empty.  Quite disappointed with obscure reservation system in RESY but the staff offered complimentary drinks and some dishes from Dining room to try for our anniversary. I assumed, the waitress/manager\u2019ve handled this kind of situation a lot\u2026 very professional.  The fact that La Carte; the garden room has different menu from dining room, we tried 5 dishes. Overall, the food was appetizing. My favorites were fluke with radish and oxalis\u2019 kebab. My least fav was tilefish which was very salty.  Portion is very small like tapas, almost bite-size. I would go back for dining room and also the garden room when it gets warm. (My feet were freezing....)",

Thoroughly enjoyed the pacing of each course, which always seemed to arrive right on time, along with the wine. (Great touch as well, since we ordered cocktails to start, they changed our first pairing to an amaro at the end, a wonderful substitute that always adds a layer of satisfaction to the end of a meal) I genuinely look forward to returning and seeing what the chef has prepared next season.",

Good portion for wine pairing, 5 kind of different wine which was about 2.5 glasses for total. For me, here provided trendy organic (natural) wine as wine pairing, but i can\u2019t really enjoy new concept wine at all. So, I can\u2019t say it was good at all, but one white burgundy pairing with sea bass was really good; typical burgundy wine smell with vanilla cake long listing. For food, tasted ok, but no impressive at all. As French cuisine, I thought it was too light taste at all, of course, portion was little for all dishes. Especially you should pay about $250 for two persons\u2019 dinner, you might need to have sth after here. There are more great taste restaurants and not so pricey ones in Manhattan. Just wondering this one is a trendy hipster style Brooklyn restaurant.",

Rum/grapefruit cocktail with Long Island rum and grand fir soda 2. Shacksbury farmhouse cider 3. House-made brioche, roasted root vegetable mage and butter \ud83d\udc4d 4. Broadbent country ham 5. Lightly smoked trout, apple, horseradish \ud83d\udc4d 6. Chicories, caramelized sake 7. Burrata, celtuce, dried scallop, nasturtium\ud83d\udc4d 8. Le kebab d\u2019oxalis \ud83d\udc4d 9. Pork and carrot\ud83d\udc4d 10. Duck, quince, perpetual spinach, wild juniper 11. Dark Chocolate, Jerusalem artichoke, toasted oats\ud83d\udcaf 12. Pear and sorrel The brioche is hot and buttery and the butter is perfect as well. The trout is super fresh, fatty and tender! I am not a burrata person but I really enjoy the burrata here with pepper oil. The bread looks like a sourdough but actually is much more oily than sourdough and thus matches the burrata quite well. The kebab is definitely a highlight of tonight. The mushroom tastes so good with the pitas! I never thought a mushroom wrap could be so delicious! The pork is also excellent, fatty meat with crispy skin. My favorite tonight would be the DARK CHOCOLATE CAKE! I would say you would regret for the rest of your life if you missed the chocolate cake. It\u2019s hard to imagine that how they could make a simple chocolate mousse so delicious without any other ingredients. I never say that I could have something every day. But I would say I could have this dark chocolate cake every day! Oxalis really should include this dessert into the tasting menu to give it a strong end!",

Flat price for a unique array of really delicious stuff uniquely prepared.  You can add on other delights as well. A beautiful creamy polenta with a shisito paste, to die for house made duck sausage, ratatouille with eggs on top complete with a lemon tart.  I had previously  been so underwhelmed with brunch menus, the fact no bread was involved just seals it.  This is a neighborhood gem, so I probably should not write this review, but the universe pulls me to share when it's great!  I have yet to have the dinner tasting menu, but that's on the horizon.  Forget the pancakes and eggs your style and by all means go out on a limb.",

Fixed six-course dining is an experience for the palate. Dishes are rich and savory, one of the reasons why portions are rather tiny.  Nothing inherently wrong with that although, while generally fine, the amount of food served would benefit from a small increase in quantity as it'd be better to err on the side of having patrons leave a spoonful on their plate than leave them unsatisfied or wanting for more. Here the old Italian saying that somewhat translates into: \"the eye too, wants its share\" applies.  Again, let me be perfectly clear... quantity is most certainly not tragically insufficient but can be very easily improved with a small increase in size.  The presentation of the dishes served was well balanced and not overdone. The simple elegance was very welcome as it makes patrons feel at ease without falling short of remaining pleasing to the eye.  I would definitely recommend dining at Oxalis and to do so for a unique tasting experience.  That said a cautionary warning is due because if hungry, I would then recommend dining elsewhere.  The meal won't be satisfying if visiting Oxalis when feeling famished. That would certainly not be a good time to experience the fine dishes served in this establishment. And it would truly be a shame because, in addition to not being able to appreciate the fine food, one would end up feeling disappointed for all the wrong reasons.  Although I pointed out that a small increase in the portions' size would be certainly beneficial and welcome, it does not mean that the full course of dishes served will not make for a sufficient meal, quite the opposite in fact. It only means that one should be aware this is a place which requires patrons to be in a specific mood when coming to dine here. And that specifically, it would be a mood where one isn't looking for quantity, or worse, is feeling starved. It should rather be a mood in which one is really looking forward to exploring dishes with unusual taste and textures, experiencing flavors that will surprise one's sight, palate, sense of smell and taste... If you are in that mood then you absolutely must really go and try Oxalis.  The reason why I pointed out the need to be in the right mood is that that it will be an integral part of what will make it possible for your dining experience at Oxalis to become something truly memorable because, without that, it will be something nearly impossible to achieve when, much like the carnivore plant in the comedy movie \"the little shop of horrors\", one's brain is screaming just one thing: \"feed me!\" \ud83d\ude09",

Mushroom pot-au-feu with addition of (optional, extra charge) shaved truffles was outstanding with the earthy, chewy presence of plenty of maitakes. Duck breast was perfectly cooked and the skin was crisp with a slight spicy kick to it.  The Meyer lemon dessert course was superb and a perfect ending to the meal. The dishes were well composed and beautiful to look at as well.  The non-drinker in our party enjoyed the non-alcoholic drink pairing menu with a series of interesting and carefully constructed beverages that complemented the courses. Oxalis's liquor license was apparently (finally!) approved the day we ate there (Feb 8) and their drinks program should be up and running by next week. We were invited to bring a bottle of wine as they DO actually have a license now. The $25 corkage fee was annoying however, as there was no wine actually available for purchase and I think it was an overstep to charge it. Nevertheless, the meal was very enjoyable and for the price, the succession of dishes can't be beat.",

Just a matter of time until this place becomes a hit spot on the NYC scene. A coursed tasting menu is only $60! And the quality is that of a much higher price. They want to making fine dining accessible and not intimidating.  All courses were creative, beautiful, delicious, and inspired. Textures, colors, and flavor explosions. Drink pairings are non alcoholic for now and I must say they were amazing and really showed their skill in that they couldn\u2019t be alcoholic. $15 for n/a drink pairing and will be I think $35 when they get liquor license.  Physical space and service are top notch. Clean space, open kitchen, great bar room, hip hop on the stereo, and high end service all contributed to a memorable meal.",
