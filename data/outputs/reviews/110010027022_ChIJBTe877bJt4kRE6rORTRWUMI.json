The word \"transcendent\" is truly appropriate here! The chef has elevated a basic food to an art form, and trust me, we've had delicious pizzas all over the world from Italy to New York and beyond. My family and I savored every bite on Christmas eve (we ordered the sausage pizza and the halloumi cheese pizza), and these pies brought so much joy and comfort to us after such a hard year. The service was attentive and sweet, and the pizzas came out after a very small wait. Thank you, Martha Dear, for braving to open during the pandemic and serving our city with your sublime food!",
