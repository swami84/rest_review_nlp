The crust is soft, bubbly, and with just the right amount of chew. I love that they put fresh basil under the cheese, too. I had the meatball today, which is what prompted me to finally review. It had the perfect ratio of sauce, cheese and toppings, which is great because I cannot get enough of those tender, perfectly seasoned meatballs.  I can also attest to the pickle pizza with mortadella being a once in a while favorite. The brussel sprout/arugula caesar is always fresh and be sure you get an oatmeal cream pie (I like to put mine in the freezer while I'm eating pizza then eating it cold).  Thank you for consistently delivering fresh, quality food!! Best pizza in Chicago :)",

Where\u2019s the beef? Guess who ended up with the slice with only one sausage? Me. Hope they aren\u2019t starting to skimp out on ingredients already. This definitely can\u2019t be \u201cBob\u2019s favorite.\u201d  We also tried out the chicken wings. Both sauces were tasty, but the chicken itself was bland. Definitely not worth the price.  We\u2019ve also tried the pickle, wild mushroom and grass fed meatball pizzas in the past. The pickle and mushroom pizzas are pretty good. The meatball pizza wasn\u2019t that good, and they don\u2019t put a lot of meatballs on it either.  Sadly this won\u2019t be my to-go pizza place since sausage is my preferred pizza topping.",

I've seen lots of pictures of their food all over the web, but never a picture of the restaurant so I was a little surprised at the size when we walked in.  It's very small inside, only 3 or 4 tables.  There's a menu board or you can grab a menu and sit down, then you order at the counter. Of course we had to get the carne Asada fries (a small which was still huge). They were really good! They come drizzled with guacamole and sour cream , and the meat is cooked perfect. But still for two people we couldn't finish. Then we tried 3 tacos, the fish, the shrimp, and the al pastor. My favorite was the shrimp, though I really enjoyed them all, and my friends favorite was the fish, it was cooked perfectly. We also got the street corn and since we were sharing we cut it off the cob. It was good, but I would have liked it with a little more chili powder.",

It's not thin-crust Neapolitan style or really thick Chicago-style stuff, but whatever it is, it's great. The classic red sauce and pepperoni or sausage type pies are delicious, as are the more experimental ones like their \"pickle pizza.\" They also make a solid gluten-free pie (not on the level of Forno Rosso, but good). Last but not least, the staff is always friendly and make you want to come back. Everything you want from a sit-down neighborhood pizza place. (Also BYOB)",

The kitchen was slammed with takeout orders when we arrived, so we expected a bit of a wait. That said, it took an hour and a half for our first pizza to arrive, and two hours for the second one. While we waited, I went to the front counter and asked a staff member for water. I had to return and ask three more times before we finally received some.  The sausage pizza came out first. It was good,  but ultimately nothing special (certainly not worth waiting for an hour and a half). While the pickled onions on top were tangy and sweet and the crust was perfectly baked, it did not have a lot of sausage. It was more like a cheese pizza with some pickled onions thrown on top, which did not meet my expectations.  The pickle pizza was next. This one was more interesting - it's a white pizza with pickles, mortadella, and dill. Overall, it was good - the flavors played well together, the quantity of toppings was good, and I was glad that there was no tomato sauce - but it was nothing to write home about. Unfortunately, ours was short on dill (apparently they ran out), which could have perked it up a bit.  While my experience may have been a fluke, that does not diminish its unpleasantness. I get that many restaurants run on thin margins and need to provide delivery services to make money, but doing so at the expense of one's dine-in patrons does not seem like a recipe for long-term success. Perhaps adding a couple of staff members to the kitchen during peak ordering hours could alleviate some of the chaos.",

First, the staff are very friendly and informative about the menu. The pizza is light, thin crust with a light savory red sauce.  I say this because I'm not a fan of red sauce, but this one is delicious!  The spinach pesto stracciatella pizza was another one that was also great! Will be returning to try the appitizers and the other pizzas! Welcome to the neighborhood and great success!",

I have been here only once, so I can only give first impression. Also I am a vegetarian, so no meat.  I added the hot sauce for extra, but that's a mistake as it prevented me from experiencing the base Sauce. I won't be doing that again \u2639\ufe0f. The mushrooms toppings was fresh not from a can. But they were chunky rather than sliced, which is how I prefer. The crust is very good. Not exactly Neapolitan, but real close. It comes to the table all puffy. Ask for a side of sauce for dipping.  All in all, I am really chuffed to have a pizzeria of this quality in my neighborhood. It's a little more expensive than what I expect but I am happy to pay. Well done \ud83d\udc4d",

Hand tossed to order (which does take more time depending on how busy they are) results in a light crust pocketed with crunchy bubbles. The standard pizza is 16\", but an 8\" is available if you walk in.  No slices are sold here. At first this bummed me out until the owner explained why. Simply put, they cook every pie to order, fresh fresh fresh. And you can't cook a slice. You won't find half eaten pizzas under a heat lamp here.  I recommend a traditional sausage pizza (thiers is topped with pickled onions, a hint of lemon) and the meatballs (house pickles, pickled onions, black pepper mayo, and biscuit like bread).  Currently Bob's is BYO, there is a liquor store across the street (closes at 9pm) and they keep it cold for you. They said they are getting thier license soon, as well as a patio.  Happy hour? Yes! But one pie get one free.  Absolute gem. Welcome to Pilsen Bob!",

The transaction was smooth, the website was easy to use, and the restaurant called me afterwards to confirm. My food was ready in about 12 minutes.  When I got to the restaurant, the space itself was nicely designed and the employees were friendly and attentive. Their pizza is the best I've had in Pilsen - the crust is a bit basic, but the pizza had good quality ingredients. No deep dish here, just your traditional pizza place. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in a pizza mood.",
