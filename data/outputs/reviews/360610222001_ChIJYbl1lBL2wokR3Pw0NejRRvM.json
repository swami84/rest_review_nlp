Most of the negative reviews here and on other services are for their delivery and service. I have yet to have any bad experience.  In general, I wouldn't recommend ordering \"sashimi\" unless you are going to sit down and pay $40 per person at a more focused restaurant.  Highly recommend for casual delivery dining !",

Another woman working there came over to the table and asked if the service was okay. I said it was fine, no complaints. So she asked why such a low tip. I was completely shocked. How unprofessional is that. I get it, some people really need their tips but tips are a generous gift not a necessity. Furthermore, I literally gave all I had to offer. I was baffled. After explaining to her that was all I have to offer she threw the check book down, with the tip in it for me to take back. Won't ever come here again.",
