        "caption": "This pop-up outdoor experience was marvelous! I took a friend here for her 21st birthday and we loved it. The drinks were spectacular- I got the Childlike Empress which comes topped with a smoke bubble and all eyes in the dining area were on that glass. My friend got The Firebird and I could tell she did not regret her decision at all. She met me try a sip, and although I preferred my choice of drink- that was one delicious bird! We got the chicken tacos to split- our server was very helpful in recommending we get one plate with an extra taco added (making it four tacos) as opposed to having to order a while additional plate of three. They were delicious as well as very filling! Overall, I recommend dressing warm as this is a fully outdoor experience because this is one pop up you do not want to miss in Chicago! I will be sure to visit the Machine in Wicker Park to experience the place where it all started.",
