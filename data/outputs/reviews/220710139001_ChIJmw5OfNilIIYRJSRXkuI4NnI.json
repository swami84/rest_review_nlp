While visiting New Orleans we went out of our way from our hotel to try this place and unfortunately it was a complete disappointment. For starters, do not go to this place expecting authentic Colombian food. We live in Florida, where Colombian restaurants can be found in abundance. The menu here is more along the lines of Colombian-fusion and well, the flavors were lacking. The empanadas were doughy and the filling was overly salted. The ceviche was average at best. The carne asada was cooked properly but lacked flavor, as did the accompanying sauce. The arepas, while presented beautifully, were just okay. I ordered a mule and had trouble tasting any rum in it at all. The service was poor and needs improvement. Upon entering we did not receive a warm welcome. After being seated, our waiter seemed to be more interested in providing attentive service to the others patrons around us while ignoring us for very long periods of time. After paying for our meal, we passed three employees behind the bar on our way to the door, and not a single one thanked us or bid us farewell. We came with the intention of having a great meal (our last dinner) before returning home, however, this place left much to be desired.",

Mais Arepa's Bandeja Paisa was good but not exactly what you would expect in regards to authenticity of flavors of beans or chorizo or portion size of rice and steak.  The steak was also undercooked or served rare and difficult to cut. We also ordered Yuca Frita. My friend who has never tried it before loved it. I who am a Yuca Frita fanatic found it a bit disappointing do to the unexpected seasonings and lack of salsa rosada. They did provide salsa rosada upon request without notifying of an additional fee. The empanadas were very doughy and the filling wasn't very prominent. The server although friendly had no idea what patacones were and pronounced tamal wrong. The caipirinhas were good. The place was very clean. The decor is nice but it is very dark. Great spot for a date if authentic colombian food is not your main goal and you make reservations.",

This was my first time visiting and honestly food is way over priced! I\u2019ve had better food but unfortunately in Texas so most people here in New Orleans wouldn\u2019t know the difference. Don\u2019t get me started on the hostess, every question we asked she had to place us on hold to check with someone else has no clue as to what is going on in the restaurant. I had higher expectations for this place. What a shame!",

They specialize in arepas, and we had one, as well as a arep sampler. They were very good. We also tried a special shrimp cocktail with large shrimps on a ripe avocado with plantain chips. Very well. The types of cocktails you drink were very good too. Looking forward to exploring the menu next time in New Orleans!  Great service and food! Traveling to New Orleans with food intolerances can be quite onerous, but the staff was more than willing to meet my needs: gluten-free and dairy-free. We had empanadas, yucca fries and salad, all of which were perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The restaurant is off the beaten path, and we took Uber to get there. However, it was definitely worth the risk of typical tourist restaurants.  If you are visiting NOLA, come here. This AMAZING restaurant is hidden off the highway west of the city center. But this should not stop you from going. This is just a couple of blocks from 2 different tram stops, and you must do everything you can to get there. We were there at 5:45 and we were supposed to sit at the bar - that's how popular this place is. (They make reservations - so think about making one!) The cocktails were delicious - the best sangria I've ever tasted - and the food was excellent. These are Colombian arepas, slightly different from Venezuelan ones. We had beef with banana shrimp and shrimp, and they were both SO incredibly delicious. What a fun evening. GO!  Place to visit in New Orleans Mais Arepas is a unique New Orleans restaurant that is worth a visit. It serves delicious Colombian dishes. Ma z de la Rueda is an exceptional dish with flavors that explode in your mouth. I think I would be happy if 5 more of this dish. There are many arepas here, but the chorizo \u200b\u200barepas were fantastic, and I highly recommend it. Finally, the flan was the perfect end to an unforgettable meal. The service was great and the presentation of the food was colorful. The hotel is conveniently located next to the National Museum of World War II. This is a great stop for lunch or dinner.

I understand there is a pandemic going around, but not at any other restaurant has the staff told us to wear a mask. We were asked if we wanted any dessert while I was still eating with half of my plate still left. The waiter came back in less than 10 minutes while I was STILL EATING, and took my plate away and again asked if we wanted dessert. We are never coming back to this restaurant.

We snagged a last minute reservation for a table at the 6 pm opening time, and joined a small crowd on the sidewalk a few minutes before the doors opened. Ma\u00efs is a smallish, attractive  space and was completely full within minutes.  Despite being slammed by the opening rush, servers were friendly and helpful. We ordered cocktails and two appetizer portions of empanadas and grilled corn. Cocktails were house specials, on point: a rosemary-scented riff on a pisco sour, and a rum/Cynar concoction. Both were very good, and the appetizers were even better, especially the corn.  For our main course we each ordered  an arepa, which is a thick sort of tortilla, split and filled with an amazing amount and variety of stuff, including relatively unfamiliar ingredients that typify Colombian cuisine, such as plantain and sweet potato. Arepas were delicious and *very* filling - we had no room left for dessert.  Ma\u00efs is a very popular spot, and a refreshing change from typical New Orleans cuisine. But seating is limited, so make reservations early.",

Well...that turned to well over an hour because guests were allowed to stay seated at a table after they had eaten and paid. If a table is done eating and has paid, it\u2019s okay to politely ask them to move. I\u2019ve seen it done at other restaurants many times before. Trust me, if I wasn\u2019t intrigued with the possibility of eating some great food, I would have left. Fast forward to us finally getting a table, I was so hungry that I ordered the empanadas to start. I wasn\u2019t impressed and they could have used more filling. My Mint Mojito was okay but I\u2019m starting to gather that I may not be a Mojito person. Or maybe there are better ones out there? For my entree, I had the Cerda which is an Arepas filled with pulled pork, cotija cheese, pickled onions and plantains. It almost made the wait worth it. I also want to mention that our server was fantastic. This is a small restaurant and they do have a fairly large waiting area with some seating. You should be able to find ample street parking within the immediate area. I\u2019d probably come again (but only early and on a weekday).",

The dood was really good, had not seen any other items similar around town as far as arepas are concerned. The bread does crumble easily on the sandwiches so I would advise to eat with a fork and knife to keep things better contained. I had a non alcoholic sugar Cain homemade soda that the bartender recommended and it was absolutely refreshing. I definitely plan on going back to try more options they had as everything looked good on their petite menu, the server said they are revamping and expanding it for dinner service in the near future. Loved the quaint ambience inside, very nice hidden gem.",

She was so happy to find that all of their food is apparently prepared authentic Columbian so there's no wheat or other gluten in it, so she could order anything on the menu.  We had apps, main dishes and deserts and it was all amazing.  The drinks were great also, and fixed pretty strong, so be careful with that.  The place is very small and has limited hours.  A local said that he's gotten there with 5 people at 8 pm on a Saturday and just been turned away, so make sure to make reservations for your bigger parties.  We just had the two of us and arrived right at open so we got a table right away but the place filled quickly and stayed packed.  We'd eat here every lunch and dinner if we could.",

The food is delicious! I follow a low-carb diet, so I sampled different appetizers, so as to stay away from the corn arepas (which are quite flavorful, by the way). The shrimp ceviche is light and right on point.  It is served with whole shrimp, enveloped in a sweet and spicy sauce with pickled red onions. Amazing! Other sampled dishes included the \"yuca frita\" (deep-fried cassava with chorizo sausage) and \"chuzos\" (grilled beef and chicken skewers). These dishes were made whole by the unique and delicious sauces that accompanied them.  The service was cheerful and friendly, if a tad slow at times. Latin music wrapped up the package rather nicely. Prices are moderate, for the New Orleans market.  Visit Ma\u00efs Arepas. You won't be disappointed!!",

It took a while to get a seat w/o a reservation (tip to all: make a reservation & put on a cute outfit) however since they were at closing time, someone came to take our order so we wouldn't have to wait longer after we were seated...smart staff! I had a mini arepas sampler, my hubby had a steak arepas, one son had the grilled chicken one & our youngest, the seafood lover, had the ceviche appetizer...portions are not huge but flavor is on point! I would like to come back for a date night & add a cocktail & maybe try a few more dishes.

The food is to die for and then come back to life and to many small deaths again through the meal. The service was faultless and when we went back, the waitress remembered exactly how I liked my drink. We love this place and would there every week if we lived in NOLA. Can't wait to go back again.",

The skewers had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly!! The Ceviche was the best I had ever had ANYWHERE in the world. The Arepas, with the plantains were amazing. I cannot recommend eating here enough. It had the perfect amount of spice, it was cooked to perfection and the service was excellent. If they keep this up, they will be noticed on a national level.",

We were also charged. 50 for salsa rosada (Mayo with ketchup), which I thought was weird since this is normally a condiment served in colombia and not charged for. Also the chorizo and frijoles (beans) were spicy which is unheard of in Colombia. You don't have to bring chorizos from Colombia just prepare them mild like in colombia. Any person who is Colombian or has tasted food in colombia would know this fact. The menu should state more Colombian fusi\u00f3n since it's not authentic. For someone who doesn't know Colombian food this is a great opportunity for you to try something with kick. Just know this is not how Colombians make it. Also don't be surprised on the wait since like I said it's s cozy place with authentic Colombian music.",

I have gone about 4 times and every time I'm beyond happily satisfied. I have recommended this place to anyone I meet and they have all been really thankful because they end up loving it as much as I do. Please note that you must make a reservation in advance  if you want a table or else you'll wait a long time (about 1.5 hours) especially on the weekends. You might lucky to snag a seat by the bar (my favorite place to sit) there you dont need a reservation. Enjoy! :)",

The mais was the best part!! I was a little worried that the portions would be too small for my liking, but I was so full that I didn\u2019t even eat my whole arepa. We were a group of four and each got an appetizer to split so we had a little of everything. Very good!",

Yuca Frita- The yuca tastes like yam but with a unique flavor too. This dish is paired with some sausages. I suggest giving this a try!  Pandeja Paisa - Has fried egg, avocado, mini arepas and more...another flavorful plate with a little bit of everything from the fried egg, mini arepas, and the columbian sausages. I would say that some things on this dish was similar to the the Picada so I wouldn't recommend going for this if you're already ordering the Picada and an Arepa (main dish)  For main dish: The Carnicera Arepa...it comes with grilled steak, avocado and plantains. It was super filling and flavorful! Because of all the appetizers we ordered I was very full by the time I got to this!

Aborrajados were a new experience for me. The melty, salty mozzarella over the crunchy sweet plantain fritters were delicious, although i thought they could have been smaller.  The arepas are well thought out-every different filling held its own and made the overall flavour better. We had the grilled skirt steak and the deep fried pork belly one.  Only one less positive note is that the empanada dough could have been thinner and a little more seasoned.  Service was lovely and attentive",

On a Tuesday night in a place that seats probably about 30 people, there was ample staffing. The food is unique and authentic. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The food was flavorful and well presented. For something delicious and different, I highly recommend.",
