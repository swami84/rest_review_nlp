He set it down at another table where the couple NOT wearing masks (as none of us do once  seated), told him it was not theirs. He then proceeded to pick it up but kept it in front of them while they argued back and forth. He finally realizes it\u2019s ours, on the entire other side of patio.. places it in front of us. We said no thanks. He gave it to another couple, virus going on and none of us wearing masks once at tables. Sent it back and we left without paying. Sorry.

I chose a cucumber maki, asparagus, spicy tuna and spicy salmon.  I found the fish to be strange tasting so to disguise the odd taste I ordered extra wasabi to drown out the fish which I could tell was most definitely not fresh.  The cucumber and asparagus maki rolls were good but I noticed there was too much rice in each maki roll. I was impressed with the service here because everyone is friendly but I just didn't find the maki rolls were  as fresh tasting as they should have been and I'm a huge fan of sushi. Prices are reasonable and the maki never fell apart but the taste is mediocre and I'm very fussy when it comes to ordering sushi or sashimi so I was disappointed with my dining experience here.  If you aren't super fussy like me you might enjoy your meal here but I'm very particular about my sashimi and sushi and I prefer a higher grade fish.  Prices here are extremely reasonable but as I stated earlier the flavors and textures here are lacking.",

We sat outside and placed order with the waiter (Asian guy with a earring in his left ear.) We preceded to chat for what had to be 45 mins to an hour without water or utensils being brought out. Keep in mind, only 3 tables in this entire restaurant are occupied including us.  By the time we looked up the table next to us called the waiter over and was asking for their water. He brought the water 30 secs later. At that point we looked around and saw everyone (7 tables or so) all with water and utensils. Our waiter came back like 1 min with the 2 rolls (no utensils or plates) right before we were going to walk out. He then told me We have nothing because of a shift change. After he left I went inside and told him and the other waiter to comp our meal for the atrocious service in which they declined. Never go it\u2019s horrible. Needless to say we left the sushi and definitely won\u2019t return. Don\u2019t go no customer service. We only ordered two rolls and they wouldn\u2019t como it. Not even give us a free dessert or something.",

We were told on the phone though, that there is often a 20 to 30 minute wait at this time. After ordering food, it took 20 to 30 minutes to come. The restaurant was only about 75% capacity. I think the wait stemed from the quality of sushi they were making, because when it came out we were not disappointed. The tamago or egg Sushi was also pleasantly surprisingly good. For an appetizer we had well done, but not over fried, gyoza. The seaweed salad was regular and I probably wouldn't order it again in the future.  It's BYOB so make sure to bring through that alcohol!",

AWESOME  Some of my faves for the evening- the Hawaiian maki, the honeybee maki, the mexican maki (spicy), the firecracker maki  We got 7 rolls and the 4 of us were stuffed. And the best part? The bill was 25$ each. Can you say happy tummy sushi time?  The place itself seems like it could be a date place but isn't really because of it being neat and utilitarian as well. There is outdoor as well as bar seating for you finicky types  The waiter service is definitely slow but I think that was due to a lack of waiters. However you can order with any of them at any time and they are happy to help you. Just flag one down and be aggressive about it.  I will be back cafe sushi. You have intrigued me.",

Their Honey Bee roll is our favorite, but we've also enjoyed the Snow White, Mexican, Firecracker and Sahara. Weekend evenings get very busy in the summer (there's a small outside patio) so expect a wait.",
