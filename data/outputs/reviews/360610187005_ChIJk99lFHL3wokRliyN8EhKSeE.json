That said, we have eaten at Raenu at least a dozen times, and have never had a bad meal there. The meals have been affordable, delicious, and have kept us going back for more. Cheap and cheerful!  Some suggestions:  - Fried calamari. I don't expect much from any place that has fried calamari, especially when it's delivered, but Raenu's managed to be fried just right and still crispy when it arrived.  - Panko fried shrimp. Like the fried calamari, this was fried to perfection and was still crispy when it arrived. Can't go wrong.  - Thai lemon chicken. They fried it perfectly, can you spot the trend yet? Huge, for an appetizer, and still juicy on the inside. Really solid order when you want a bunch of fried chicken with your meal.  - Crab fried rice. Yes, always yes. You get a heaping portion of fried rice, and some REAL crab meat spread out on top. We have taken to ordering an extra crab fried rice so we can have it for meals on other days.  - Pad see ew. So tasty, so greasy, so good. The noodles are always done just right, and the flavours are on point.  Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of the rice dishes. Hell, I order one and split it into two meals, and I have a voracious appetite.  100% recommended.",
