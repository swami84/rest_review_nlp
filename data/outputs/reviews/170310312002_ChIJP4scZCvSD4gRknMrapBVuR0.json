Now I do not understand why people only want to review a place when there's something wrong with their order or a mishap, but let me tell you all, the food was unbelievably well made and the presentation was great. I ordered a 16' Classic combo for dinner for my husband and I, and though when I called in the girl who took my order, Vanessa, sounded like she was in a very busy environment, she still took the time with all the patience to answer each and every one of my questions throughly, like wow! So much attention to the customers. The presentation again was great, loved the way the pizza look and obviously the taste didn't fall behind, it was just as we had heard and expected. Did not disappoint! As far as delivery, again, we did hear it busy in the background and the young lady did mention they were definitely busy and that it would take an additional 15-20 minutes for my delivery, no prob!!!! When my driver arrived, he was following all protocols as far as COVID, and the food was hot and in good condition. 10/10! Would recommend \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Do not listen to the bad reviews, restaurants only get reviews when something bad happens or a misunderstanding, never when they do a great job! This place is great!",

The person at the restaurant said they had the right apt - that driver had a picture and then said as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d we can remake it and deliver again. The order finally arrived 2 hours later - no one called or said anything and left it in the lobby - we casually found it sitting there while coming back from walking our dog. The order was still wrong and only ONE item was sent -(chicken parm sandwich) it was cold - it was undercooked - it was all shaken up and it was a completely mediocre presentation and the taste was terrible. Oh - the receipt had some other address or unit - not even mine or what is under my Grubhub info! Extremely poor customer service and literally no attention to what they\u2019re doing!

When I called the restaurant to inform them of the mistake they told me it was impossible for their driver to deliver it to the wrong place.  I found out the food had been sitting unattended in a public place for about 45min (which, to be fair, means the delivery was pretty quick).  It was cold and I had no intention of eating it any more.  I asked what they could to do to fix it, I was still hungry, thinking they might redeliver hot food to the right address.  Instead they offered to refund my order which was fine but not what I expected.  The kicker is they never actually refunded the order!  It was an honest mistake and an easy enough fix. They just didn't seem to have any interest in fixing it.",

I was surprised they have pepperoni pizza, as it is usually sold out or they just don't make it, because it would mean they would have to work more.  I absolutely hate sausage pizza. I live less than a block from this location. When I get home there is a slice of sausage pizza.   The lady working, who claims to be the manager tried to convince me I ordered a slice of sausage.  On my past review of this place I commented on how it is best to call ahead if you want a slice of pepperoni, as they only have sausage pizza by the slice.   Everytime I went over in the past there was only sausage pizza available.   So, to get home and find a slice of sausage pizza ..I will never ever go back there again.   IF the lady working the register is the manager, I can only imagine how the rest of the business is ran.",

We ordered a 20 inch pizza, don't even see that size on the menu but okay, and the cost came to about $28. We ordered 1/2 black Olives and the other Jalapeno Peppers and they charged us the full $3 for each ingredient bringing our pie to about $40. The problem is we have purchased in the past and each time there seems to be differing costs and no matter the pie an increase in price with no rhyme or reason for the pricing. Yes, we have gotten different types in the past but, Why we paid $40 for a thin pizza with 2 half toppings made absolutely no sense  and things are beginning to look shady on our bills so as much as I enjoy their pizza I and my family will have to look elsewhere for a pizza in Chicago, there are many.",

That\u2019s your excuse for rudeness and failure to deliver in a reasonable time?  Not to mention not having the ability to provide me a time at all?  You claim you are a manager, shouldn\u2019t you know the time your kitchen is running on based on orders received, employees and preparation time?  Seems to me with all the restaurants struggling and all of the people in the industry out of work,  that you would try to retain your customers and not complain about being busy and using that as your extremely poor excuse for bad service. As far as the attitude and general lack of any kind of care or respect for me as a customer, this woman should not be a manager. As an employee of a restaurant right now, you should be thankful and grateful you have customers at all. I trusted you to make my food and not pass on a virus to me. You took that trust and threw it in the trash. You have lost a long time customer.",

We ordered a pizza and the combo app. We got home and found that the pizza we were given was wrong and the app was burnt. So we went back to get what we ordered. We decided we wanted to wait rather than get a refund and were told that it would be 15-20 minutes. Great! So after 20 minutes we walk inside to check on our food. Then we are told that it just got put in the oven because there were other orders! We work in customer service. We understand the issue. But making a customer wait double the time to get a corrected order is unacceptable. It's been an hour and a half since our original order was placed and we have yet to get food. It's just very frustrating wasting all this time when all we want is what we paid for.",

Obviously he liked his meal because there are no complaints there. Rosatis really isn't a sit down restaurant they have a few spots they let people eat as a courtesy. As for the complaints from 2 to 4 years ago they were owned by somebody else. The new management also self owned is as nice as can be. I have rarely found a place where they care about making their customers happy then here. Both quality of food and fast delivery are their highest priorities. Give them a try I not only highly recommend them but know you will enjoy your food and call them over and over again.",
