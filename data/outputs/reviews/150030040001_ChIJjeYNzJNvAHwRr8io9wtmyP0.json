I've tried a few items and the seared salmon is still my favorite. The kitchen is fast; they'll have your food ready in 10 minutes or less so it's perfect for the downtown office crowd.  There are seats outside the shop if you want to sit there and eat but it's busy because people are walking by to pick up their lunches from the other businesses. There is no parking available nearby so it's better if you just walk here. Come by 12pm for the best selection because they do sell out of certain things.",
