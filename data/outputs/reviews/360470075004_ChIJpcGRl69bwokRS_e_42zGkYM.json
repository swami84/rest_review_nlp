This is a white, thin, wealthy place and they make no effort to be inclusive or welcoming to anyone outside that bubble at all. Besides that their food is prohibitively experience and pretty hit or miss, sometimes things are beautifully presented and taste great and sometimes they\u2019re messy and the veggies taste a little old.

However everything else is $$$, I figured a small smoothie for $7 would be the average sized small of most cafes and smoothie places in manhattan. When it came out of the back kitchen it was literally kid sized. I want to like this places food options but between the prices and the homemade alternative milk recipes that need a bit more tweaking, I think I\u2019ll pass from purchasing again.

Also, that you can get a squirt of CBD in your coffee and pick up a nice pre rolled is a pretty good draw. Though one visit, a barista got really snarky with my follow up questions about their cbd products and he couldn't recall the name of their supplier farm or describe their \"signature\" drinks to save his life. My other visits, I was helped by a woman with great energy who volunteered a bunch of information and made me a really nice latte. Great potential--will be back and can't wait to see how they grow.",
