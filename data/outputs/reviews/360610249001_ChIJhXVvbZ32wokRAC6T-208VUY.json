Asked for a manager and was told to come back tommorow for MY money. 8 dollars seems small but it was my money. They said if i came back I can talk to the manager tommorow after me repeatedly telling them I do not live here so would just like my money because I wont be able to come back they thought they could start speaking in spanish (which I do understand) and calling me out of my name and saying that even if I came back tomorrow or called the cops I will not see my money back. Absolutely horrible stealing from your customers. And then thinking its okay to speak to them however you want to. I then made them aware that I can understand them and all of the sudden I need to speak to them with respect! So far when I call the store I can no answer so I guess I just donated my money to them.
