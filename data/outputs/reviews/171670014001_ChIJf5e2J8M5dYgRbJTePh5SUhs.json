I ordered a personal favorite, the pit-smoked brisket on Italian bread with smoked cheddar and barbecue sauce. Normally I get that sandwich with an assortment of veggies and peppers, along with extra BBQ cuz I mean hey, who doesn't like that?? But anyways, I get to the second part of them constructing my sandwich, and without even asking if I wanted anything else, the worker proceeded to cut my sandwich in half, which is the last step before they wrap it in paper. I politely asked if I may have some more toppings, and in turn received a dirty look from the employee. I did receive my toppings, although sparse, but struggled to eat my sandwich as she never finished cutting it through, seeing as the employee left off the cut at about three-quarters through. Overall it was a very negative experience, and I recommend getting employees who actually care about what their customers prefer on their meals. Thank you!",

I (along with 7 other parents) were chaperoning a group of 28 third graders through the museum.   The students brought their lunches, and the parents were going to buy their lunches from Subway.  We asked the two employees manning the Subway if the kids could eat their lunches at the table with us.   They said that it was for paying customers only.  We asked if it was ok we bought 28 cookies (as well as 7 meals) if they could then eat with us.  The employees said that would be ok.   The kids all sit down, begin eating their lunches (this was at 11:30AM and the restaurant was empty).   There were 12 empty tables available and an additional section that was roped off.   At that point, the manager storms out of the kitchen like a bat out of hell and yells at us that we can't eat here.   I asked why not and she said that it was for paying customers only.  We told her that we bought 7 meals and cookies for the kids so we indeed were paying customers.  She said that we still didn't count.   (?!?!?).   By this point, there was a line of 2 people at the checkout with senior coffees.   The managers said that we need to get up so that they paying customers would have a place to sit.   I pointed out that there were empty tables in the roped off section.   She told us that we needed to leave.   This manager was extremely rude and cruel to a group of 3rd graders.   And we're in the Abraham Lincoln Museum where Abe Lincoln's main vision was that everybody should be treated the same.  Luckily, corporate was very accommodating and apologetic.   They followed up with the store who said they contacted me.   Nope -- nothing - no emails in the junk folder or voicemails in my inbox.    I like Subway, but would recommend you eat at another location other than this one.",
