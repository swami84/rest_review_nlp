They previously made a Malai chicken roll and I was fond of it but they stopped selling that item for some reason. Please resume selling malai kati roll because the seekh kebab roll is not top notch. The chicken tikka kati roll is also pretty decent but I found the malai chicken roll to be more flavorsome. I have tried their beef biriyani which also tasted fine but I feel it's a bit dry and the meat gets overcooked. I once tried their rice pudding and almost fell in love with it. Overall the food experience is delightful given this is our go-to place for takeouts. If you're looking to have bread try the garlic butter Nan with Goat curry, which is absolutely scrumptious and in dessert you can try the Nutella naan too.",

I expected it to taste fine, but the meals flavors exceeded my expectations.  The food was extremely delicious, what I assumed would be more on the hot and savory side ended up kicking my tongue with a bit of sweet and a melody of spices that went well together. It wasn't extremely hot, in fact my receipt said mild despite not being asked, but it had a decent amount of heat. Just enough to savor, though ide like to see it kicked up a few degrees.  The rice was good, white rice but cooked well. The Naan on the other hand was flavorful and large. It went well with the curry.",
