When we got to signature and sat down they said happy hour isn't available with a reservation. Our server became very impatient very quickly asking us \"are you going to order off the regular menu or not\". We were going to order either way we just were informed differently on the phone. The server was pretty rude through out the whole night until she gave us the bill. We felt very uncomfortable with her but thankfully we had another server as well named Nicholas who was fantastic. I cannot say the same for his counter part Kaoza I think her name was.",

The best view of Waikiki and Ala Moana Beach Park from the top floor, 36th floor of Ala Moana Hotel. You can also enjoy the night view. But my favorite is happy hour. You can eat New York or Ribeye Steak for $ 25, and other items are also cheaper. The steak slider is a slice of steak on a soft taro bread. This is a great $ 7.50. Wine is as high as $ 13, but beer is cheap at $ 5.50. Happy hour is done until 18:30.

To begin with it was our anniversary. Greg was our server he was great from the beginning and told us he will be treating us with a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for our anniversary. He checked on us during our appetizers and we had ordered old fashions for our first round, we then ordered a glass of wine and our main coarse. Main coarse came and we saw Greg got busy with 5 other tables, he passed by us 6 times, the table across from us got asked if everything was ok all 6 times he passed. I went up to the host and asked to speak to the manager. I told the manager we just want to get some service we have been waiting for exactly 30 minutes to order another round of drinks our food got boxed up we wanted to order a bubbly with our dessert as well, he mentioned he had came and checked up us when he didn\u2019t, no one has checked up on us for 30 minutes till one of the helpers asked if we wanted our food boxed up. He then said thank you for letting me know, he then brought dessert and said this was a complimentary for the wait........:He misunderstood the whole point of us wanting to order another round of drinks, he completely ignored everything, I had told him it\u2019s not the servers fault he is very busy can we just get some service. Even though  we got ignored six times. I heard him go up to the server and told him to attend to us right after he walked away from our table and my boyfriend told him he just wanted the dessert. The only thing the manager did was bring us the dessert that was suppose to be for our anniversary and switched it by saying it was a complimentary......... after I had said we wanted to order another round of drinks... super disappointed as for how the manager handled the situation, he completely ignored what I wanted. It made us feel like they just wanted us out of there. Never coming back.",

But, we had to ask the staff for a cocktail menu, weren't told of any specials (we overheard them tell the table next to us), and had to change our order twice because the server didn't let us know things were out until after we ordered. It was only 6pm and not a busy weeknight, but the service seemed to be confused at the start. However, it got better once we got our menus and orders straight. But once again, we weren't told from the start that things were unavailable, as the dessert I wanted ended up being out of stock after they took the order. I don't mind menu changes at all, it happens. But for $150/guest, we shouldn't have to change our orders twice or ask for menus.",

Bartender asked me if everything was good and I told him no and showed him the steak.  His reply was sorry and that the kitchen keeps screwing up the orders ???  I tried to eat it and ended up leaving 1/3 of it .  He picked up my plate and never said a word.  For a $55 steak at a fine dining restaurant you do not expect this service.  No manager ever created by and no discount was offered.  The garlic mashed were good, not great and the garlic fries were OK.  I will definitely be going back to Ruth Chris next time.  I like good food and service !!!!!!.",

Caesar salad dressing tasted bottled, lazy. Filet Mignon was great, cooked perfectly as was the Ribeye. Delicious! Baked potato was huge with a lot of toppings. You'll definitely want to share. Service? Waiter did not know what types of liquor the bar had, did not want to check. Waited 20min for beer to arrive, warmed from sitting out waiting to be served. Only saw him again when he brought the bill. Mashed potato was complimentary with steak order, not mentioned by the waiter but hey, I had a great baked potato which I would not have ordered if I knew about the mashed potato. We had the wrong steaks served to us so decided to switch them myself, glad the manager saw me and came to complete the swap, plates were hot. Would like to support local during covid but Signature missed the mark for me. There are better places for steaks with better attention from the staff.",

There was a mini red carpet leading to an Express elevator. Live music played as we entered and the view was amazing as we watched the skyline change. Food was delicious though a bit of a wait because we wanted to skip the appetizers as warned by our server, but we were saving space for our steaks! My husband loves his rare and I got mine medium rare. Both were divine and cooked to our liking. For our sides we shared a baked potato and asparagus. Then for dessert we had ice cream. It was such an amazing evening and I hope to return to try more of their menu.",

They called me on my birthday to tell me that they do not accept reservations for happy hour , 4 hours before we supossed to meet and celebrate. They offered me to book the dinner instead and because i felt without any other option, i accepted. My friends arrived at 4.45 pm and all happy hour tables were booked and they went ahead with dinner reservation. When they arrived, they asked if possible to use the table near the view but it was immediately refused saying that my reservation was for 10 people instead of 8, therefore we stayed near the wall. When i arrived at 5.10 pm,  i walked in towards the dinner table but it was very noticeable that there was a round table with reserved sign on it in the happy hour area, so I am not sure how things are handled. After some of the invites showed up and we ordered drinks and pupua, the pupus were overpriced,  low quality for the amount of money. They came in so late, cold. They gave us taro bread , bad quality, pink color and the most horrible balsamic vinegar.  The worse bread and the cheapest balsamic vinegar to go with the horrible aka taro pink bread. For the exorbitant price you pay here, the food was cold and unpleasant. Very disappointed, they only let 4 bills per table. They automatically added the tip, forcing you to pay what they impose on tips.. Do not go there. I will not. Thank you",

The salads were prepared to perfection - especially the \u201cwedge\u201d salad.  Now the steaks..., slam dunk. Cooked expertly and perfectly.  Ahh, the wine choices - perfectly matched.  The after drink selection - extensive and you have to love it when they serve it with one large ice cube.  And the service..., simply the best in the area. Attentive without being obtrusive. Professional and courteous.  Don\u2019t let the prices full you. You are dining for the experience of some of the most incredible views you will experience in Waikiki.",

We had a reservation for 530 and when we arrived theres an elevator in the lobby specific for taking you to the steakhouse. Then upon arrival we told them our names and we were sat within 5 min of arriving. First thing we ordered was fried calamari, which came so unbelievably fast. Next was our dinner. I ordered the fillet minion 8 oz rare. The most perfectly cooked steak I've ever had. With the freshest ingredients. Also got the lobster mac and cheese which was by far the best mac and cheese I've ever had. The bacon was a nice touch to flavor of cheese blend they use. And again you could taste the fresh ingredients. Because we were there to celebrate our wedding. They brought us a complimentary dessert! It was the lillikoi creme brulee (I'm not personally a fan of liklikoi) but they NAILED it. This place is by far the best service and food I've had since moving to island. Will go again.",

There are many Westerners. The day is full. We made a reservation so we had a nice sofa seat. The fireworks had a building and looked a little.

The shrimp was pre-prepared, the bisque was tangy, the fillet was soft and everything was delicious. Only black pig roast and sour bread were normal ...

I was taken back after validation and still have to pay $6.  For some reason, this place only validate 3 hrs and your are on your own after that.  It was hard to swallow after paying $500 for dinner and they still wouldn't give me full validation.  For dinner, we had a bottle of wine, seafood tower, scallops, beef tartar, 28oz wagyu tomahawks for 4 people, and 3 sides (spinach, truffle mash, and mushroom).  Highly DON'T recommend the seafood tower (1 small lobster, 4 prawns, 4 oysters, 4 piece of rejected tuna sashimi) for $80.  Instead should order the 2 lobster dinner ($85) which I think this is a better deal.  Dessert was overpriced, creme brulee $12.  View was alright not much ocean view and we all agreed even with the view, food was overpriced.  Also the wine list is marked up 3x market price.  They charge corkage fees if bring own wines.

Unlike the regular table, it is not located on the window side, but it was a comfortable table. From seafood to steak, the happy hour menu is almost half price, and other regular menus can be ordered at discounted prices. The food is very good, and you can drink a lot of beer with garlic green soybeans as well as steak. The dessert cream brulee also had a little fruity scent and was delicious. I liked the service very much. It may be the best in Honolulu so far (laughs). I want to come again!

They split our party up then the waiter (white guy) comes and tells us about the specials for the day real cool and nice guy. After he told us about the specials he left to grab us bread and then The manager changed the white waiter out for a black waitress all because we were black. Then wants to say the waiter had been there all day but the waitress told us out of her mouth that the manger made her clock back in because she was headed home. Our party gets up to leave and the manager showed no kind of hospitality to the situation. Sad to say I will never go back to this restaurant.",

The lamb meat is also crispy on the surface and has no smell, and it can be eaten deliciously at the museum. A potato salad with truffles is also recommended. The beer is also great while picking poki and avocado. Next time I will come cheaply at Happy Hour. The seafood tower with lobster was smaller than I thought. The view is superb with the 36th floor and glass layout. Then my daughter told me birthday and served cake with surprise. I was really happy because it was a surprise.

It is on the  34th floor overlooking Honolulu with large floor-to-ceiling glass. In our group we had ordered the tomahawk steak the filet and I believe a New York strip along with veal chops, scallops and sides. while the scallops and the veal were not remarkable, the red meat dishes were outstanding.  They were cooked perfectly juicy, flavored and we shared them around the table. They were excellent. It's white tablecloth and the waiterstaff is perfection. It's a bit pricey of course but for the experience it's quite worth it.",

At 1 point the female bartender is looking through one of the ice bins, walks over to the male bartender who goes over to the bin and, using his cell phone as a flashlight, looks for something that had apparently been lost. They kept using the ice by the way.   Eventually our order was taken and the drink was OK.  I asked for the bill, the female bartender gave it to me, I promptly put my credit card,  and she ignored it for several minutes.",

Waiting for about 15 minutes I was guided to the table with the table on the grand piano, but since the front of the window is the window side, I could spend quality time cheaply.  After a while the piano performance began, making it even better. Place a ten dollar chip in the glass container in front of you, and then select Southern songs or songs for us.  The cuisine was in the house and two people, I asked New York steak, mashed potatoes, locomoco on a happy hour menu, but it is just a good amount for drinking while drinking. The meat quality is lower than the steak of the course of Ruth's cruses that went half a year ago (although it is natural), considering the atmosphere, it was a good dinner with COSPA.

The food was okay. The steak was good but burnt seared medium rare and salty. I expected the steak to melt in your mouth, no, but it was good. The one thing I loved was the seared ahi katsu. I tried to order the Bruschetta but they were out.  The view was beautiful. We had a nice time but I don't think I will be going back.",
