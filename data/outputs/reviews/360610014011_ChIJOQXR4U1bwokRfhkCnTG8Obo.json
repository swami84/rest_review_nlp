I had the chicken manousheh and it was phenomenal. It\u2019s some sort of wholesome wrap. I also got this interesting hummus where the chick peas aren\u2019t smashed and they come whole!  I got free roasted assortment of peanuts on the side as well. Everything was really flavorful and delicious. Try their 961 beer too it was a perfect drink before the meal.  The service is off the chain as well and the young female working there is very kind and accommodating. I would highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner.  Thanks y\u2019all!",
