Let me tell you, these pork buns are fantastic! The flavor is great, it's not overly oily, there's good size pork pieces, and the pork to bun ratio is on point. The prepackaged buns are delicious even after being in the fridge a few days and then heated up in a bun steamer. Buns can be put in freezer if not being eaten in a few days, usually keep some in the fridge, some in freezer. This is one of those places that you'd only know if you've lived in the area as it doesn't stand out from the dozen other Chinese food places in the area. Luckily I was brought here by someone who use to live in the neighborhood and have made it a point to stop by and grab a pack whenever I'm in the area. Highly recommended!",
