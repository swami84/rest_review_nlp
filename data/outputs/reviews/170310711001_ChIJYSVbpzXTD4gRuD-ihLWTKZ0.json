There are many crepe places in Chicago worth supporting, unfortunately, this is not one of them. After asking one of the employees about the cold crepe, they were less than interested in hearing the critique which led me to the review.

We love crepes and have had them in numerous European countries and repeatedly at local Chicago restaurants. We have never had crepes like this. The first crepe we ordered was stuffed whip cream and was cold to the touch. I\u2019ve never had a crepe with whip cream inside so we decided to order a 2nd one and say no whip cream: This time, I saw them pull out a stack of pre-made crepes from a refrigerator and stick one for a few seconds in a countertop oven and then smear some Nutella inside of it.  It was also cold and as we told the man who made it about this he said a) it\u2019s supposed to be served cold b) they don\u2019t have time to make the crepes at the time of ordering and c) that next time when we order after they make it we should tell them to pop it in the microwave . It was really an embarrassment and a sorry excuse for a small French patisserie. I will not be going back as there are way better places in the neighborhood to support. The man who we gave the critique wasn\u2019t interested in hearing it.",

My favorite was the Quiche Lorraine but I would certainly order everything again. The quiches are definitely best ate fresh though they still travel well. The tomato soup was not too creamy which I was a fan of. Will definitely be returning!",

They also serve Big Shoulders coffee and other coffee/tea drinks, as well as croissants, breads, and more.  It took a long time to narrow down my first selection. I got the Parisienne Quiche and the Mediterranean salad (which I put on a bed of spring lettuce when I got home). The salad was delicately, but perfectly seasoned; the quiche was fluffy and dense with flavor.  The chef/owner (who is also the chef of Chez Moi down the block) was there to greet everyone and the staff was friendly and competent.  When the world is more \"normal,\" I'd love to linger longer; but in the mean time, it's great for delicious takeout and coffee. Overall, prices are reasonable, quality is high, and worth checking out.",
