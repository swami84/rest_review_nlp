My friend came to this store and I went to the restaurant next door. When I was finished, I came to this store to wait with her while she gets her food. Literally a few seconds after I came in, the guy behind the counter had said to me \u201cOoh you can\u2019t eat outside food in here....\u201d. For starters, I wasn\u2019t planning to eat in there AT ALL. I didn\u2019t even sit down yet and I didn\u2019t reach in the bag to get my food. So he was 100% wrong for making that assumption. My friend told him to relax that I wasn\u2019t going to eat there at all and instead of owning up to his mistake and apologizing, he kept justifying what he said. After that, he walked up to the owner of the store, who also was making my friend\u2019s food, had whispered something to him and they both was staring at us. At that point, we both felt UNCOMFORTABLE and VICTIMIZED. Also, my friend found hair in the food she bought from there. Never coming back to this racist establishment. Please shut them down!!!",

The Mac and cheese wasn't very cheesy, and the mac looked like it was bathed in food coloring. The mash potatoes wasn't creamy or buttery it was clumpy and bland.",

The chicken smelled delicious and I pitied all of the hungry souls sitting near us on the subway. The jambalaya was bland, the chicken was indeed crunchy and I detected a mild flavor, but I'd rate Popeyes way higher. The biscuits were delicious and were covered with a sweet, buttery glaze.  About six hours later, I was awakened from my slumber by an upset stomach and a gross, greasy taste in my mouth. Considering I hadn't eaten anything else since a slice of pizza for lunch, it had to be something from KKC. I won't be returning... especially since there's a ton of Popeyes locations in the area.",
