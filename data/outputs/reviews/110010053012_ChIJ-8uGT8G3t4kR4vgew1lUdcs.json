I ordered a seafood linguini, they didnt give me an spoon or a bowl for the shells, and again I asked for things, but it was noticeable that the empty shells were in the way.

After being seated at our table, we waited for 20 minutes before the server came over. We ordered water and drinks and asked if the veggie burger was vegan. 10 minutes later, we had to grab her attention while cleaning the table next to us, and she said she still didn't no about the Veggie burger (still no water or drinks either). She was at a nearby table a few minutes later, and we called to her and asked again. She told us the burger was vegan but the bun was not. Then she literally turned her back to us and walked off without even asking us if we wanted to order it or anything else. We were really put off and decided that if our water and drinks didn't arrive within 5 min that we would leave. We ended up leaving and we're glad not to give them any money.  Now I know it is Pride, and all the businesses are slammed. But all we needed was to be acknowledged and treated respectfully, and told there would be a delay. But to be blatantly ignored and rudely spoken to is unacceptable. It also put us in a bad mood during a day that should be about celebrating ourselves. I live in the neighborhood and won't be returning to Trio again.",

The taste was even worse (they had this very rancid taste to them) but then I didn't really wanna be a killjoy at a friend's birthday party and didn't say anything, just finished the fries. And now I'm home, stomach starting to hurt, Google search saying that fishy smell is a definitive sign of mussels having gone bad.

I\u2019d suggest going when it\u2019s warm so that you can enjoy the outside view and weather. Our waiter, who was male and fairly new, sucked though. He didn\u2019t know anything and was inattentive.  Went back on 10/07/18 for the lunch/dinner menu. Did NOT enjoy the baby back ribs or slaw at all. The fries were good.

        "caption": "I was hangry but Agora was closed. Nice charming restaurant, tables seemed really close, didn't see seating option for anything super fancy (not a big deal for me). Oddly enough, it felt like it was just my date and I the entire time even with steady normal restaurant activity. So I dunno, you'll have you make your mind up on the ambiance yourself.  Waitress was wonderful. Pleasant. And efficient. And clear. Great personality. Cute and clean. I paid the minimum cash tip but it wasn't because she wasn't worth more. (Hence the review.) I think the owner was even across the room from us, just casually running thangs.  Food was REALLY good yo..big strong, lightly breaded and perfectly seasoned calamari; also had a chicken bruchette that was good as $#\u00a1@. That came with 4 good mini sized pieces of grilled chicken (succulent, flavorful), tzatziki (Agora has some solid competition on the block!), and a lightly dressed up veg blend of onions, cucumbers, tomatoes...yeah, great food at good prices. Their menu selection theme  seems to be intended for under 18 yr olds, seinors, date night (small open bar area in front), quick bite, small plates, and libation. Oh! The drinks.  I had 2 mojitos. The first one was like lemonade. Or so I thought, as it hit me about 10 minutes later. The 2nd was good too, nice buzzy feeling. Light, perfectly blended drinks. I had instructions and the bartender followed them flawlessly.  Would definitely go again, mad I never stopped in at least for a drink before.  Lastly...no tvs. Good afternoon music, but owners might want to think about installing some as an investment.",

After the man next to me commented on my lack of service I started to get frustrated. One of the three bar tenders made eye contact with me and then turned around completely ignoring me. The man next to me again commented on how that was such a tease. I laughed it off but then when I saw the same bar tender chilling and texting I decided to speak up. I politely called out \"excuse me sir\". He turned around looking shocked that I would even dare to speak like that to him. All the bar tenders looked at me and one said we are busy. I 100% understand being busy and was calmly and patiently waiting but after getting passed over multiple times and seeing people getting served who came up to the bar 10-15 minutes after I did getting served right away I was pissed off. Of course after I said something they really ignored me. When one of the female bartenders who had been in front of finally had nothing else to do but serve me I got a drink. When I asked to speak to a manger it turned out to be the guy who was texting. I explained to him the situation and even apologized if I had offended him for calling out. But that I was still a paying customer and being ignored blatantly like that was not okay. He laughed at me and said its busy this time. Implying that I was being dramatic, not even making eye contact or taking any of it seriously. I have never in my life felt so disrespected and belittled. Do not go near this place and let's hope it closes soon so something much nicer can take its place.",

The dressing also made it extremely hard to spot the sparse pieces of dry turkey.  The Caesar salad wasn't nearly as bad but it all tasted like it came straight out of a bag.  Decor: I don't put much weight into a restaurants decor since it has little to no impact on experience.  That said this place is dark, dirty, and outdated.  Sure, it could use a remodel but they should really focus on food and service.  Service:  After waiting for 20 minutes for two salads we asked our waitress the status of our order to which we were quickly bushed off with an, \"It's coming\".  A few minutes later she yelled from a few tables away, \"a few more minutes on the chicken\".  True to her word, a few minutes later the Chicken Caesar Salad came out with no sign or mention of my Turkey Cobb salad.  Finally, 5 minutes later, after 30 minutes of waiting, my less than appetizing salad arrived.  After poking at it for a minute I decided to refuse the food, which I have never done before, due to the time it took and quality of food I received.  The waitress decided informing me that she didn't make the salad is the same as an apology and took the salad back.",
