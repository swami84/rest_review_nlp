Most importantly, Bubbles are cooked perfectly and given at a perfect portion to be drink with the tea. (Perfect = If you sip on the tea and bubbles together, you will finish both at the same time) Many bubble tea stores in Chicago dont even give you enough bubbles to go along with the first few sips. You can see the heart they put into making a cup of drink. I'm from Taiwan, and I approved this store. :-)",

Everything was so tasty--I felt like I was having a Shokugeki moment. Even the rice in the karaage donburi had this delicious subtle mayo-like taste. It's the details with Chi Yatai that really make the food! The staff were so friendly and gave us recommendations on what to order, and what kind of tea went best with the boba we wanted. Definitely looking forward to coming here again!",

Topped with seaweed shavings.  Yum!!  We also ordered the Chicken Katsu Miso sandwich which was equally delicious.  This sandwich has juicy white breast meat with thinly julienne cut cabbage and miso sauce which gently soaked into the white bread.  The bread was ideal because it was light rather than a heavier bun.  Dessert was absolutely made to perfection We had the Matcha milk custard with fresh strawberries.  The custard will cool and firm and tasty!  Food was delicious! Presentation of the food is appealing and the packaging so cute. Owner- management is extremely friendly and ready to help with food descriptions. So if you're new to Japanese small plates or street food... no worries. Portions are great.  Order a few orders. Definitely shareable. Prices are good too!  My daughter recommended Chi Yatai. Great job!  Remember it's a hidden gem. Located in Chinatown at the Richland Center.  Proceed to the lower level- food court. It's the 2nd business on your left.",

Reservations were very easy to make via their website (we had to sign a contract and put down a deposit because we had a party of 15). Valet parking is available for $4.00, which is very reasonable - especially for LA!  As for dinner, there's an unlimited salad bar that guests can help themselves to throughout the meal. As with other AYCE Brazilian BBQ restaurants we've previously visited, servers come around with different types and cuts of meat so the meat is always hot and freshly prepared. I would say all the meats we had were very flavorful but nothing stands out as extraordinary. I would however, return just for the grilled pineapple (it's cooked with cinnamon and is one of the best things I've ever had!).",

We came right after we landed in LA around 10:00pm and  thankfully no wait as we were famished.  At first glance I was disappointed of the amount of sides they had at the table. But after tasting what they had provided us I was satisfied with the quality and taste!  The meats were good and even better with their special dipping sauce. I like the service they provided and the fact that they cook the meats for you to perfection. Their corn with mozzarella cheese was pretty good, we asked for seconds!  5 stars for good food and service. Also, kudos to this place opening past midnight!",

We got the chicken karaage bowl and chicken katsu bento box which both are cooked with egg and onion and come with Koshihikari rice. The owner, John, was very kind and gave us some background on the Japanese rice and explained some of the dishes to us. The dishes were delicious, and largely portioned, I couldn't finish all of my karaage bowl but my bigger fiance, who got the larger bento box which has even more food and a miso soup, could eat it all(although they didn't have miso that day but kindly subtracted it from our total)  Since the seating area is gone during covid times,  I'd recommend walking over to the Ping Tom memorial park and finding a table to eat there by the river like we did  Thanks Chi Yatai and John, we appreciate the extra attention and kindness!",

They have the best takoyaki, chicken karaage, katsu sando and strawberry custard I have ever tasted, which are very hard to find elsewhere.  Everything is made from organic ingredient, and they have the perfect balance of flavors and textures that add a sophisticated touch to the dishes. Takoyaki has the warm creamy fillings inside that will melt way in the mouth, especially with its unique combination of mentai (salmon roe), green onions and seaweed on the top. Macha latte bubble tea with sesame cheese foam is what I would urge everyone to try here since it will give you exhilarating experiences of varying savory tastes. I think these dishes are something that anyone can\u2019t help not like once one tastes it.  With the most welcoming and friendly team of wonderful people at Chi Yatai, anyone who visits the place will walk out full of savory food and warmth. Much much recommend this place.

My wife and I were greeted by the owner John who was so passionate about his food and took care to explain each item on the menu as well as give solid recommendations.  He recommended the takoyaki, Pork Sando, and their signature dessert.  I want to say I wasn't expecting much as I was here for my Szechuan food but we figured gotta try it out.  I am so glad we did.  The takoyaki was amazing, the ball was perfectly crisp on the outside and the inside was tender perfect chew and seasoning.  Very well executed as well as thoughtful twist to a classic dish.  The Pork Sando was as well perfectly executed from the subtle toasting of one side of the bread in keeping it light and fluffy with a crisp.  The pork was perfectly fried the sauces we asked for on side were a great way to make each bite unique and special.  Now for the surprise winner of the day, the milk custard with fresh fruit was honestly mind-blowing insane.  I love custards and this was one of the best I've had with its smoothness and rich fresh flavor.  Even if you eat at another restaurant this is the place to get dessert and bubble tea!  A great addition to the Chinatown food court that I know won't disappoint!",

It is now Chi Yatai, and it brings some fresh new items to the food court selection.  I was greeted warmly by the staff and new owner, and they explained what sets them apart. No fructose syrups, filtered water and filtered ice cubes, and no powdered teas. They brew all of their tea fresh for their boba chas and use organic milk. Definitely like the sound of that, and so does my body.  Their menu is clean and straightforward, with a logical diagram: Pick a tea flavor, pick some bases, cheese or no, customize the sugar and ice level.  We ordered a matcha, a panda (black and white boba with fresh black tea), original takoyaki, and a large Chicken Karaage. We didn't order any cheese on the beverages this time.  The matcha was excellent, great flavor and balance with the milk. I kept it at 50% sweetness with no ice, it was just right for me.  The panda milk tea had these white bubbles that had a texture similar to a firmer grass jelly, giving you a satisfying chew. Definitely had a fresh taste.  Takoyaki was very tasty, on the soft side and runny.  Karaage had excellent flavor and was very juicy. I wish I could eat this with rice or on a sandwich. The lemon + salt blend gave it a balance range while the meat was very generous in portion. Its very light on tendon, which I think a lot of people will like.  The matcha custard we sampled was my wife's favorite, I hope that makes it onto the permanent menu!  Highly recommend this place for boba tea or a tasty Japanese snack! A nice addition to the already amazing food court's selection.",
