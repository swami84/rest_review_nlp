I don't know if it's due to the coronavirus but the last two times I went there the service was terrible. The first negative experience was with a lady at the front desk. I come in and I'm greeted with an attidude, as if I'm imposing on her time. Then she wants to debate about the price. I come here everyday and get it the same price everyday and she wants to charge me extra. The next day different lady, I get charged the price I typically receive. I open up my food and the rice is burnt. After I spent a good 20 minutes waiting for my food. The service is not what it used to be. Some people don't realize that customer service is the backbone of a good business. I won't be comming back.",

The taste is authentic enough for me, and the pad thai, which is usually oversauced at restaurants, was al dente with the right amount of flavoring.",

If you are dining during lunch, then order one of the lunch specials. I had the chicken heaven with ginger rice and sweet chili sauce. The spicy sauce mixed with the ginger was a burst of flavor in my mouth. Delicious. The drunken noodles with chicken or shrimp is really good. The appetizers are good. I had the Thai bar b que ribs, shrimp and chicken dumplings, and the curry puff. All were good. They offer an extensive menu. The restaurant is small. The prices are very reasonable.",

My favorite is thing to order is Pad See Ew w/ beef it's thicker noodles and very filling. My only complaint is that lunch hour is getting busier and busier there so I have to order my food in advanced.",

Ordered via Seamless - food was delivered steaming hot and on time. I am a fan of their pineapple fried rice - it came with good amount of veggies (pineapple, tomato, etc.) and your choice of meat.  Price is also reasonable. I'd definitely try other dishes at this restaurant.",
