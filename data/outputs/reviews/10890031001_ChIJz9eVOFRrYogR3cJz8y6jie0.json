I ate here for my birthday this year and their special events coordinator Stephanie facilitated my supprise birthday wonderfully with my fiance by having her come in for a wine tasting and personally helped make the night better than I could have ever imagined!

My parents and her mother had their Pot Roast and it reminded them of my grandmother's which I had never heard them compair a restaurant to.

I had the ribeye that was cooked very well but a poor cut of meat, losing 1/4 to gristle and fat. It was drowned in a bordelaise sitting on very watery garlic mashed potatoes ( to much sour cream at least). There was complimentary bread, if you asked for it.

We ate there on May 28, 2019.  Parking was easy since it was the weekday and after 5:30 PM. I found free street parking within 100 feet. The friendly staff greeted us as we entered. The restaurant is average size for a downtown establishment and they also had outdoor seating, though we sat inside. They seated the five of us in a booth and we did not feel crowded. I ordered the ribeye served over green beans and mashed potatoes. It was all good and I would order it again.  Overall, Commerce Kitchen did a really good job, the food was good, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere was conducive to a pleasant evening of discussion. I recommend this place.",

The appetizer i had was fried green tomatoes with pimento , they were very crisp which i like and thick but they were so under seasoned without the pimento on top. So I\u2019ll probably never cop green tomatoes from any restaurant outside of southern restaurant.  Secondly i had the harissa salmon breakfast bowl with eggplant zucchini and salmon. Now that was seasoned it was so so good! I wished i was served a bigger portion as i am a woman who can eat; you see the random waffle. Yeah that\u2019s mine too.  The waffle was so delicious though. Very sweet for a regular waffle which i enjoyed because i hate plain waffles.  The atmosphere was okay, it was kind of different and weird to be the only black person in the whole restaurant, and not even a worker to be seen with melanin. But it\u2019s okay, these are just the times we are in. Good food none the less, just a little pricey. LOL.  follow my  page on Instagram @__getfitwithtj\u263a\ufe0f",

The steak was really tender one of the best steaks I have had in a long time. I did not need any sauce just they way it came was great.

I made reservations more than three weeks in advance for dinner for two at 5:30 on a Thursday evening - not a busy time. I specifically requested a booth along the interior wall of the restaurant. I have previously made the same request and was well accommodated. Not this time. The manager told me he would never accommodate such a request for a party less than three people and that there was \"nothing he could do\". I pressed the issue since the restaurant was nearly empty, could you please make an exception to this \"policy\" and allow us to enjoy a meal in a booth? I went on to explain that we celebrate all of our special occasions at Commerce Kitchen, we're good customers and this is a small request to make our experience more comfortable. He raised his voice to me saying that he couldn't help me. We left and will not return. Completely disappointed.",

Also had the spicy Bloody Mary.  It was too hot for me, but the waitress did warn me.  My guest had the shrimp and grits.  Her egg on top was solid, so overcooked.  We were both eager to order dessert.  The waitress had been borderline annoyed from the start, but we stayed.  My guest had creme brulee, while I ordered the Bourbon Milk Chocolate Pecan Pie.  Her dessert looked perfect, but was actually heated through, a fail for brulee.  My dessert came with the crust half missing off the back of the pie.  Backless may be seductive in a dress, but not so much with pie made in a frozen supermarket crust.  At $8 per slice, that's a $48 pie that didn't involve even making a crust.  Shame.  Shame.  The waitress didn't apologize for the piece being messed up in serving.  She also didn't inquire when it went untouched.  My guest was served brulee with a fork.  We couldn't even find our server for 10 mins.  I finally got up, found another server to get a freaking spoon.  No apologies.  No courtesies.  The check came and the waitress ignored the untouched botched dessert, but charged for it.  Save yourself the trip.  You can botch food at home without the markup and the disrespect.",

When she gets back we are seated and our server was visibly annoyed to be sat with another table. Considering the staff was so intent on closing early we decided to not take a chance on ordering $30 steaks and have them half-heartedly prepared so we left. They close at 10pm so I could understand if we walked in 10 minutes before close. Considering we arrived approx an hour before close I felt their attitudes were very poor.

I understood going in that each side was $4 a piece, which is fine (I do not mind paying for quality and who messes up breakfast right?). I ordered a waffle, which was delicious, a side of fruit and bacon (to split). I received 3 pieces of bacon (regular bacon). The fruit was two slices of oranges (no bigger than 1/8\" each), three strawberries, and three blackberries. The fruit was unwashed and one of the blackberries was rotten. AGAIN I don't mind spending money, but that seems ridiculously overpriced to me. My husband got chicken and waffles. It had sat for so long before being served that the crust of the chicken stuck to the waffle and came off and was flavorless.The coffee was really thick, which is fine, but it had so many grounds in it that I seemed like you had to chew the coffee. We try to always give restaurants the benefit of the doubt because we know how hard the industry is, but we are disappointed.  We were celebrating and thought Commerce Kitchen would be a wonderful place. It seems to have rave reviews. We got right in and the restaurant was clean, unique decor (great decor), and the staff was dressed nicely. We ordered drinks and an appetizer which were incredible. Then things went downhill. The main course was disgusting. I ordered steak (my favorite). It was way overcooked, the sauce made it taste like airplane food, and I subbed my green beans out for fries (which they served me the fries and green beans but not the mashed potatoes). The fries left a lot to be desired. My husband got his favorite meal of lamb. It was all fat, the bones were shredded into the meat. The best part of his meal was the kale. On top of that, it was very pricey. I don't mind spending money on a good meal, but this was not that. #disappointed",

This last time, 30 December 2017, was a remarkably different experience. The portions we're smaller, rolls resembled the frozen Sister Schuberts yeast rolls, and the desserts were not very good and had a store bought taste. May have been an off night, but the experience to value ratio was not happening this evening. I will give them another chance as they have always provided a very good meal in the past.",
