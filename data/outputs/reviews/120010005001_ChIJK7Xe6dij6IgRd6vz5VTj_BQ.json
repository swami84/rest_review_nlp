Two of us never got glasses for the mimosas and after about 30 mins had to go up to the bar and ask for some as the waiter was pretty scarcely seen. We all ordered food and waited an hour and a half until the food finally came out. My omelet actually never came out so I just had them remove it from our ticket. My wife's french toast was a single slice, which is a pretty small portion for the price.  Went a while back just for drinks and a snack. The beer was good, but the pretzel sticks were obviously microwaved.  Seems like they are just not a good place to go for food.",

Our friends arrived at 10am and the place was not set up and it took around 10 to 15 minutes once I arrived to just get water. I had several servers during the meal and between the three of them, one mumbled, the other forget to bring silverware after saying hed be back, and the third had the same issues with a box to bring home my leftovers and gave an attitude when we asked for the bill.  Maybe they were short staffed or underprepared for the crowd(we were the first group there at opening), but overall the service made me uncomfortable. Food and beer is good, poor service 2/5.",

He said he would ask his manager, who apparently wasn\u2019t immediately present, about the situation.

You can move the tip up or down (it isn't easy to do and you have to do it before you insert your card), but they don't tell you that it is already on there, so it would be super easy to accidentaly double tip. They have an updated menu with a bunch of new items as of this week (5/20) and the wait staff seems to not quite know them all yet. Also, it was really weird when my friend's Cesar salad came with the dressing on the side. I definitely would go back for the beer, however! I had two of their brews that were amazingly delicious. And while I might snag an appetizer, I'd probably walk down the street for supper.",

My friends all do trivia on Wednesday, and their wings are huge! $1 wings doesn\u2019t sound like the best wing deal until theyre served to you on a thick, heavy wooden platter. We always have the same server every week and we love him. He\u2019s funny and so kind. The beers are nice, but the beer vats- just decoration. Deceiving but very decorative. Speaking of decoration, the hand blown light bulbs and neat wall murals are sweet. They should expand on their board game selection and the golf machine is out of place? The jukebox machine is $$$. Overall, I love coming here for the atmosphere and beer and food specials.",

The brewery had its grand opening on the day we went. It was busy, but not to the point that we couldn\u2019t move around. There was tasteful live music playing inside. Bar games were availability including a couple arcade games and giant connect 4. A few TVs are scattered around the walls of the brewery. The main room is cozy and makes good use of the space. It too cold outside for us to venture into the beer garden, but there was outside seating available.  We sat at a table where one of the staff members happily waited on us. We tried a few of the beers, the \u201ctotchos\u201d, and a burger with bacon jam. I can safely say everything was delicious. All of the beers we tried were awesome and we look forward to trying even more. Our waitress was attentive and friendly despite how busy the brewery was.  Overall, Big Top\u2019s new Gainesville location might become our new favorite spot to have casual drinks in downtown. Great space, atmosphere, food, and of course beer.",
