My food was in a single plastic bag with a knot. The food it self was in a card board paper like tray. No staples, no tape, no aluminum, no stretch tie. This leaves an open door for food tampering. I'm not for it. There was no shrimp in the shrimp and crab meal. You really could not tell irr was crab it was so much sauce.  My cat fish was burnt, my chicken sliders were hard and dry on a bun with syrup. No lettuce, no pickles. Again I'll give it another try but I'll pick my food yoo next time.",

The menu said there was lime applied to the chicken when it didn\u2019t feel like it, but the butter syrup just didn\u2019t give it a pleasant taste, for me, it needed to be sweeter. The chicken and fries were awesome, but the seasoning and sauces weren\u2019t up to par",
