I had brought along my mother so she could do some shopping and when we saw this place, we knew this was going to be where we had lunch. It was a great decision.  They have a well rounded menu that offers popular Northern Chinese dishes.  Prices were very reasonable and found the portions to be generous, but not oversized.  Everything was tasty and freshly made.  We ordered the Layered Flat Bread Sandwich with Pork #2, Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup #5, and Cabbage with Chili Oil #16.  I think the best was the soup.  Lots of tender and flavorful beef in a rich and spicy soup stock with just the right amount of noodles.  Excellent flavor all around.  The Sandwich had excellent cook pork in it and was good, however the flat bread was rather heavy and oily, but that is how it is supposed to be.  The cabbage in chili oil was a flavor buster.  Not to hot, but the spicy enough to make you cough a little.  Had an interesting additional flavor I couldn't put my finger on, but it was good.  The operators were very friendly and attentive when ordering.  They  were also very nice to bring our food out to our table verses making us come up to the counter to order.  Thumbs up for nice service and good food.",
