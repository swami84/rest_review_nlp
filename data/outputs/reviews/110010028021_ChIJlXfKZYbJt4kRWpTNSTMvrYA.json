I would characterize this place as a very limited convenience store, with a sandwich and coffee section included.  The sandwich options seemed pretty decent, so I ended up ordering a roasted chicken sandwich that included mostly vegetables.  The vegetables included cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and ranch dressing.  On top of that,I purchased a prepared chef salad.  I waited around inside of the store which the person behind the counter was preparing this.  I asked another employee if I could use the restroom, and she gleefully indicated to me that the restrooms were closed due to the pandemic. I was fine with it, but as I walked away I could here this employee high fiving another employee and laughing about the fact that she refused to let me use the restroom. I don't know that their amusement was the actual result of what was told to me.  But I felt offended either way,not because the restroom was closed, but because I felt that these employees were making a joke about it.  I left with the chicken sandwich and salad, and I hope it turns out to be something decent by the time I can enjoy it at home.",

After I paid for a simple sandwich, had to wait over 30 minutes just to have a supervisor get someone to start preparing orders, and that was after I and several other complained.  On top of that, they didn\u2019t even had Mac n Cheese, which btw I paid for like 40 minutes before.  It\u2019s my fault to pick this store because I should have read the reviews and seen the atmosphere prior, but it was the only place open after 10 pm in Columbia Heights.
