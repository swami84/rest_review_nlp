A little upset since I thought the shawarma here in Philly was good, but now nothing will compare to this. The bread was so soft and the flavor of the meat and whatever else they put in there was amazing. In sh Allah I\u2019ll be back next time I visit NYC. If you guys wanna open a shop in philly I\u2019ll be your first customer!!  *update* I\u2019m sorry to say I have to update my review after my most recent trip here over the weekend. The man who works at the counter and makes the food was very rude to me. Perhaps because I don\u2019t speak Arabic. He didn\u2019t even so much as crack a smile or even attempt to be polite or appreciative. The icing on the cake was, he slammed my money on the counter and didn\u2019t even say thank you or goodbye. And on top of that, the shawarma was not nearly as good as the first time I had it. It was overly salty this time and not enough garlic sauce. I would be able to overlook the food being a little lacking and just call it a one-off, but the character and rudeness of the employee just put me off this place. If they want to succeed they will need to treat their customers with respect. I don\u2019t see any business sense in a restaurant which doesn\u2019t value their customers.",

Baskets full of different types of breads, pre-packaged containers of cookies, and all kinds of pastries sold by weight are all made here by the skilled bakers, as are stacks of breads available for purchase. A gigantic oven sits at the back, and if you are too shy to peek around the corner just ask to use the restroom and you will have to walk by. The oven fills the restaurant with intense heat, and the man rolling and tossing dough for flatbread sheets called laffa (or taboon) looks just like a pizzaiolo.  \"This bread is straight from Jerusalem!\" was stated at least five times about the delicious ka'ak during our stay and it could be felt how significant this was to him. Even in Palestine the bread is unique to the city, travelers from other parts buy many loaves to bring as gifts to their friends and family. The crust is soft and covered in sesame seeds, the bread inside even softer and so light. Despite being almost a meter long before cutting, it is not heavy and feels like it might float away.",
