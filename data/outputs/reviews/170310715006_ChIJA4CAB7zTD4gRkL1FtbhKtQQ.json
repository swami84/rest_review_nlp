        "caption": "Get ready for an experience. Most of our group wondered if they would get full during this experience, I can report that all 4 members of our party left full and satisfied with their meal.  There are a couple of things I like to see improved. When we arrived, we entered a room with 15+ people in it. During this pandemic, I was freaking out inside. I would have liked to seen the room emptied a bit before we entered. The room is small, it is probably 400 sq. ft., so 15+ people seems a bit much.  The good things. The barter is super friendly and likes to make drinks based on what you like, rather than you ordering off a menu. I am sure they will let you order off the menu, but we enjoyed the cocktail surprise.  You will be waited on constantly and consistently. There will never be a moment when you won't feel taken care of during your experience.  The chef if super friendly and so is the staff. If you want to chat with them, then they will gladly engage, otherwise they just want to make your experience excellent.  The sushi: Each piece was amazing and the chef made it an art form. You'll get to experience many types of fish. I was surprised that I enjoyed a couple of fish that I would usually never order. The chef tells you about each creation, I personally couldn't hear any of the descriptions or details due to the noise. I was happy to just eat each piece without knowing.  Is the cost worth it, Yes! The quality and the service are excellent. I was a bit stressed out by the room and the close proximity of the people that were not in my party. You'll like the experience, but if you are taking social distancing seriously, this will stress you out.",

The drinks from the bartender couldn't have been better. Best cocktails I've had in awhile. Last but not least, the sushi was delicious! The chef did a great job explaining what we were eating and really made the experience feel special. Overall great experience! Highly recommend!",

Each course better than the next. The chef was so friendly, talked us through everything, and wrote down all the courses afterwards so we could remember them. Would recommend to anyone. And to the couple who bought our drinks - thank you so much!!!",

It is located in a suite room in Lincoln Hotel that looks fab, btw! The atmosphere is very intimate and the group is up to 6 people so its not crowded. Also it was the first time I was told to eat sushi with your hands not to mix fish flavors on the sticks! We had 17 different dishes and I thought I would leave hungry but it was so filling! Every other dish was better than the previous. The fish was the freshest I ever tried and it was literally melting in your mouth. I am definitely coming back again! Sincerely recommend this experience to everybody! Worth every cent - you won't regret it!",

The vibe is awesome and trendy. The 6 person sushi bar is intimate and a great experience to know what you are tasting and where your fresh fish is coming from. The chef was so down to earth and it was great that we chatted like we were all old friends. I highly recommend trying this experience and tasting the delicious 17 course sushi experience was so very pleasing to the pallet and I cannot wait to go back!",
