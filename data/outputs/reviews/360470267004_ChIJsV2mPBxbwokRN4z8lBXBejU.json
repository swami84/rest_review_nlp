It opened  only about a week ago and is my new favorite go-to spot. The food is made with fresh ingredients and efficiently right in front of you. As a vegetarian myself, I recommend the Balla Focaccia! It was delicious and filling and tasted so fresh.  I love a cafe with a variety snacks, meals, cute corner seats, open lighting, free wifi, and a peaceful atmosphere, and Corto has all this and more! I can\u2019t wait till the backyard opens this summer!  Cristiano, the owner, is pleasant, authentic, and passionate about his work. We chatted about why he opened the cafe and it was lovely to see his personality and passion in his work. He brings authenticity to all his food and drinks and it shows! Make Corto your new spot and never run out of tasty treats to try!  Wish I could recommend more!!",
