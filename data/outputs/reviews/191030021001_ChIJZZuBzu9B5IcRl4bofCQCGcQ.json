        "caption": "To start off, the employees were GREAT. It's a very poorly run establishment. I pre-ordered on the website early in the morning for an afternoon pick up. I double-checked to make sure I put the correct time, especially since I requested a later time and the website says they don't open until 10. When I arrived, my order was nowhere to be found. The employees apologized saying that it was made at 7:30 a.m. They made my order quickly, were perfectly pleasant, and I was out the door. The food was good but overpriced. Other things I noticed were that some employees' hair wasn't properly secured, their personal drinks were on the prep counters, as well as their phones. I don't blame the employees for the missteps. They legitimately probably didn't know what they were doing was wrong. If I could go back and give 100% of my money straight to the employees, I would. They deserve it more than the company does. --And to update, the owner of the company sought me out by email, attacking me and blaming the poor experience on me. Complete with my receipt, full name, and phone number.",

They have big windows which let the natural light in and are connected to a coffee shop giving it homey vibes. It has a cute name and logo. They have sandwiches, salads, and soups and unique options at that. However, the food at Heirloom left me wanting more. More warmth, more satisfaction.  I ordered the Turkey and Avocado sandwich which was cold. It was good but I felt like I could have easily made a comparable sandwich at home. There just wasn't anything that wowed me about the flavor. I also had the Heirloom chili which was good (not very bean-heavy) and I found myself dipping the sandwich in the chili to give it the extra something it needed.  I also nibbled on my sister's Philly cheesesteak sandwich (needed a spicy element or the chili to dip into) and my mom's custom salad (nothing special). I rarely get sandwiches out because they are almost always disappointing and this confirmed that.  The most annoying part was that the people doing the chopped salads were making so much noise. We couldn't hear ourselves talk from across the restaurant. There has to be a quieter way for them to chop those salads.  If I come back to Iowa city, I don't think I'll be coming back to Heirloom.",
