Make sure to ask for a wine recommendation, because they really know their stuff. Overall, great food, great service, and a wonderful outdoor space. Safe to say, Popina is a must-visit (and then again, and again, and again).",

Super careful with only having 1 person in the shop at a time and limited interactions with staff.  They even built the tip into the pricing so after you pay & get your food, you can just leave.  The seating was spacious and 50/50 had nice atmosphere (50% in a cute garden, 50% in an adjoining alley) but these days who can complain?  Food was delicious, they were out of the brisket meatballs so we will need to return soon to try and get our hands on those.",

The Negroni was tempting, but I ultimately settled on ordering a peppery red wine to accompany my meal. We tried two starters - the arancini (love) and the meatballs. We also tried the cavatelli and the pappardelle because they are the two homemade pastas on the menu (the other two are imported). The waiter was attentive and took time to explain each dish.  Overall, it wasn't my favorite place ever, but it was tasty. I appreciated the unique Southern (American) flavors infused into classic Italian dishes. At the end of the meal, while we signed the check, a cockroach crawled across the wall of the restaurant directly towards my seat. I jumped up out of the way so that it wouldn't crawl on me or in my purse. We left our signed receipts on the bar and left. I didn't receive any sort of apology or acknowledgement from the staff who tried to catch/kill the roach, which was disappointing. Maybe I'll try Popina again next year.",
