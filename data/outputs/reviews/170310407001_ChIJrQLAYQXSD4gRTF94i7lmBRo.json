They have quick, excellent service (although to be honest we usually do pickup, which is very efficient and COVID safe.)  I have never been disappointed with the food quality- it\u2019s always hot, reflects the spice level I ordered, and tastes wonderful. Be warned- spice is pretty high here, so if you order food and you worry about spice, I recommend ordering it COMPLETELY WITHOUT spice. (Usually when you order by phone, they ask if you\u2019ve eaten there before so you\u2019re aware of the spice level. Also...it literally has \u201cspicier\u201d in the name.)  My go-to is the pad see ew- full of vegetables AND meat, a really hearty portion, and at unbeatable prices. This is a place that has the best price-to-quality ratio that is clearly catering to customer loyalty- and it works. I have also had their pad prik and musman curry- both of which are equally as good as the pad see ew. They also have great appetizers and appetizer deals. Order here and I promise it\u2019ll become your staple Thai takeout!",

The most recent time we went was about 2 weeks ago, and the waiter served us water in PLASTIC cups (yes, you read that right) while everyone else got glass cups. What the heck?! My friend also found a live black bug in the Pad Thai YUCK. I couldn\u2019t continue eating after that. It\u2019s hard for me to think that we were treated this way bc we are POC & minorities, but MAN they suck. Do NOT go to place expecting good service. Very disappointed bc I thought the food was good but after we found the bug, we will not be coming back again.",

Personal favorites include; the fried vegetable gyoza, which always arrive perfectly golden brown and crispy, and the chicken pad Thai. The portion is very generous, and the noodles and chicken are perfectly prepared. I have learned that the mild peanut sauce still has a fair amount of spice to it, but not overwhelmingly so. The mild plus is also delicious, but a bit too much for me.  I have also tried the spring rolls, which were crisp and refreshing, and accompanied by a sweet tamarind sauce. Another dish that I have sampled quite a few times is the yellow curry, with tofu. The curry sauce is tasty, and packs serious heat.  Additionally, I suggest trying the Thai iced tea, which pairs nicely with many of these dishes.",
