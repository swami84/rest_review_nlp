After trudging the old wood stairs you walk into a 1950s tiki lounge. Very nicely done decorations and the staff is awesome!! We were seated at the bar at a cozy table for two. Our waiter Justin arrived and apologized for the wait but suggested the Tempura Asparagus as our appetizer. OMG they were amazing!! Drinks were great and the main course was phenomenal! Crusted rib eye with mash potatoes and mixed veg. Again ITS WORTH THE WAIT!  When in Boise you must visit and partake of their bounty!!!",

We ordered the forbidden nachos and our jaws hit the floor when  they brought out this monument to human accomplishment that was a basketball sized plate of nachos. I looked around the table and watched everyone's eyes swell with joy as they took their first bite out of the titan sized plate of nachos. The pulled pork melted in our mouthes and the cheese exploded with flavor as we piled chip after ship into our muzzles. Everyone was in awe as we sat there stuffing ourselves full from the nacho equivalent of the titanic. Our wait staff Meagan was phenomenal and very accommodating, she understood our orders even though we where trying to order with a mouth full of nachos. 10 out of 10 highly recomend. Thanks for the great experience.",

She went to the restroom, came back and realized she had left her phone, so I followed her back to call it for her if needed. On the way down the hall, she got dizzy, fell over and started having a seizure. An employee saw and says, \"we cant have her in here doing that, we need to have her leave.\" I explained she wasnt drunk, she sas having a medical issue, they said it didnt matter and she cant be laying on the floor. Like she choose to have a seizure and be on the floor? They could see her shaking, they didnt care. I eventually got her to the bench at the top of the 2 flights of stairs. She was sick, lightheaded from the seizure, and had to lay down her head on the bench for a minute. They said I had to get her up, we had to get out. So, I had to help her down 2 flights of stairs right after a seizure while she could barely stand. Out into the rain we went after paying our bill. Thanks a lot for the inhumane treatment. I cant believe they saw her having a seizure, then made sure she got out into the rain. They 100% saw her shaking on the ground, we had been there for over 2 hours, they could check the tab to see dinner and 1 drink for her. Never been kicked out of a place for a medical emergency, the reef will sure make sure you dont stick around if you do. They had 2 or 3 people around us at all times to make sure I got her out of there by myself at all times. Crazy treatment of another human, just crazy",

But not sure if it is worth it with the parking and just for one stop for the night.  The Reef offers a great happy hour until 6pm for drinks and a really good deal on appetizers! Although it's hot on the Rooftop that time of day, there are shaded areas.  The concrete table tops make it durable for weather but too hot to touch and melted our drinks quickly.  Service was so so, friendly but not terribly responsive and it wasn't that busy. Pretty par for Boise dining unfortunately.  The Rooftop has its own music and only the live music performances can be heard inside (a cooler place to be in more than one way...lol)  Will have to try it again later in the evening next time and bounce around downtown more.",

Bartenders were friendly, and a huge variety of tropical drinks to choose from. I was impressed by the Hukilau posters inside, and the Tiki mug collection in the cases outside the hallway to the restrooms. Food was great.

Since lots of places downtown have great food and drinks its usually a waitstaff that makes a difference for me or my friends, so for him we will probably go back but its gotta be said that Reef shouldn't be rolling out out dated punishments like that.

However her methods were not working and she decided to whistle to get her attention since it was so loud. The waitress turned around and very rudely said \"That is not how you get attention\". My mom apologized, the lady took the picture and proceeded to drop the phone on the table and again told my mom how rude she was. I didn't know it was acceptable to be rude to customers and that talking to coworkers who are off the clock is more important. Especially on their birthday.",

There is zero music playing, the lights are way to bright and it\u2019s very cold. Their service was notciably slow. Maybe they are under staffed. We asked them the turn the heat on, turn music on, and dim the lights, but they didn\u2019t change a thing. So I defiantly won\u2019t be coming back here.",
