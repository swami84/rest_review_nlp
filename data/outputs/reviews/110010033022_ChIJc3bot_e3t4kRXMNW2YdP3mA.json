        "caption": "Decided to visit Glassey after seeing an ad for it on social media (FB or IG.) Seemed nice based on the photos.  Parked out front, the place looks just as it had in the photos online. We walked up the stairs (party of 2), and began feeling a sense of \"this place seems cool.\"  We were the second party in the store at the time. One other young couple already sitting in the corner.  No one at the register. Saw a lady working in the kitchen.  \"Oh well, we will wait.\"  The lady in the kitchen definitely saw us, it is one with an open view. She did not acknowledge us, or greet us while we waited by the register.  \"Someone will be here shortly\", I thought.  A young lady came to the register after a few minutes. Seemed like she was doing something upstairs (I didn't ask, not my business.)  She told us to take a look over the menu, and that she would be with us shortly to take our orders.  Told us that there was a hookah lounge upstairs as well, and that if we wanted hookah we could order it and then sit upstairs. She walked away.  About ten minutes went by again. No worry.  The same young lady came by after what seemed like a good eight or nine minutes, took our order. Glassey is a place at which you order at the register and pay before taking a seat. Ballin.  Ordered the Chicken Biryani , Chicken Tikka Burger, Channa Masala Sabzi, two samosas, two mimosas. $69.58 bucks.  We sat down, saw our drinks being made, and then saw a sign explaining to us that guests are to bus their own tables. Sure.  Eight or nine minutes go by - the young lady brought us our two samosas. We got started. Samosas are nothing complicated, and they were good.  Ten minutes go by. Another ten. Another ten. Maybe even another.  The same young lady who had taken our order and prepared our drinks came by and let us know that the Chicken Biryani was unavailable, and that we could substitute it for something else.  We asked that our order for chicken biryani be substituted for for a butter chicken dish.  Not my personality to be an irritable guest, so I did not ask about our other food. The young lady helping us did not bring it up. Nice.  We ordered two more mimosas, continued to wait, drinking our mimosas, and enjoyed the dance-inspired Indian-film music remixes playing on the TVs above the bar.  Our food arrived. The burger was delicious. No argument there. Happy to have ordered it. Channa masal sabzi was sub par. Not happy to have ordered it. Butter chicken  was sub-par. Not happy to have ordered it.  We got through our meal, laughing inside about what just happened to us, thinking about the potential of this place, how we had a not so savory experience, and how we spent so much time there. Awkward.  The host asked us what we thought of the food. We communicated to her, clear and earnest compliments for the taste of the chicken tikka burger.  We got up and paid the rest of the bill (four additional mimosas). Total came to $29.10 .  Summary: 100 ish bucks for:  1) One really delicious burger 2) Two decent samosas, 3) One order of ok at best, Butter chicken (we couldn't try the biryani because we were told that it was unavailable after over half an hour of being there) 4) Six mimosas 5) Way too much time in the place  Left the place feeling as though we were not really welcomed, which was a disappointment because the decor is nice, and the food is decent (albeit overpriced.)  Thought I'd give it a bit of time before writing a review. Did a little googling, came to find out that the young lady helping us was the owner, and has been featured in a few local publications as a young entrepreneur / restaurant owner.  That's cool. Something to be proud of. She must be proud :)  Before writing this review, I read a few others - seems like many other folks have had a similar experience here.  Might go there again for a drink if I'm in the area, and have time to wait an  hour for the chicken tikka burger.",

The 2 star rating is coming from being there for 2 hours and not being given any food. We had to take the food to go because we were at a point where we had to leave and they had just wrapped up our food. Spent most of the time drinking. Although the young bartender/waitress/owner was nice in accommodating things that were on the menu but not available when we ordered, the drinks are WAY overpriced.  Typical Indian place, charge $15-$17 for a drink that is made with well alcohol and barely any of it.  We ordered around $200 worth of food and about $150 with of liquor.  None of it worth it.  Not worth going here in my opinion but nice try!  Get better operations, have a better attitude, and step it up a bit and I think you guys have a chance to make it. Otherwise, you won\u2019t last.",

It\u2019s worth noting that the chicken burger with fries costs you a cool $21. So do with that information what you will.  The Jiya\u2019s curry was good, not great.

This restaurant had been on our list for a while ever since we got to try food from this restaurant at our friends'.  The location is convenient though you have to look for the entrance next to the other businesses.  We tried the following dishes: Chicken Biryani  - this was a good dish - rice was cooked well and the chicken was tender and flavorful.  Saag Chicken - this was a good dish and had a kick to it too. The spinach provided a nice flavor to the dish.  Butter Chicken - it was a good dish, not necessarily what you would expect for the traditional butter chicken. But it had enough flavors to be a good dish.  The accompanying channa dish with the rice was a good version that satisfy all types of palates.  Definitely a good place for Indian food and we should be back soon for more of their food!",

The staff was very helpful in answering questions and providing suggestions regarding the dishes as I am not an expert in traditional Indian cuisine. Everyone had masks on and there was sanitizer readily available throughout the restaurant. They also have a nice patio area that keeps you covered from all of the elements with ample seating. I will most definitely be returning to try the Masala Fries and much more.",

I will say, it turned out to be quite spicy\u2014which I really liked, but if you do not like spicy food you should tell them.  I got takeout, but they also had what looked like 6-8 outdoor tables.  I had learned of this restaurant before it opened, but did not manage to try it until now. I am ABSOLUTELY going back.",
