At the door, they incorrectly marked us with X's on our hands to indicate we couldn't order alcohol even though we were 23-24 years old. I tried to clarify multiple times that were were all 21+ before they marked our hands and their Sharpied us anyways. Later we insisted that we were all of age and all provided ID and were told that if we had fakes, that they would keep them. This experience kind of annoyed us, but we were still able to order alcohol as usual.  The place is packed with a party atmosphere. The music is pumping, it's dark, and hard to hear each other.  We ordered kimchi pancakes, ddukbokki AKA tteok-bokki, boodae jungol AKA army stew, spicy squid, stone bowl bibibop, and garlic noodles. This was plenty of food for 6 people and we cleared nearly everything. All their food is amazing and not too spicy even though I have a tough time with spicy food. Their portion size is really good for the price.  I'm knocking it down a star for the trouble with the 21+ mix up and the food is pretty slow to show up, but we had lots of good company at the table.  During covid, you can't just order drinks, even if you plan on ordering food in 10 minutes; you have to order some kind of food with your drinks. There has to be a minimum of $25 spent per person as well.",

We stopped in, bouncer was friendly, sat us down, and our waitress came out within seconds of seating. They did a great job working with covid regulations and still provided a fun place to go. The only reason I don\u2019t give it 5 stars is because our waitress wasn\u2019t  super friendly, seemed like she had a stressful night. She was a little rushed as well and messed up our drink orders. They had good music, good lighting, and the food was better than any other place we ate at that night! It was fresh, hot, and took less than 10 minutes. We were amazed at how fast it was with how busy it was. The other bouncer that stays in the middle of the room was super kind too. He walked me to the bathroom because I couldn't find it. Both bouncers would open doors for us ladies and was just kind. Good food, good drinks, and average service.",

I used to live in Korea and struggle to find Korean restaurants in America that feel authentic. And the food and flavor here was awesome. Portion sizes were great. However, Korean restaurants are expensive in the US so I feel as if my service should be on point with it. We ordered a Soju and beer tower. I took a sip from the glass and I had to pull something out of my mouth. I literally pulled something 2-3 inches long out of my mouth on my first sip. It could have been a paper towel I\u2019m not even sure what it was and neither did the waiter. They did give us a new tower, fine. We were polite and moved on. We ordered bulgogi but received a super spicy meat dish instead which we didn\u2019t order. They took it back, the waiter came over and apologized for mis-hearing me and gave us what we ordered instead. Fine. By the time the dish we ordered came, we were already practically done with the rest of our meal. So two negative things happened during my experience at this expensive restaurant and nothing was comped out. I just feel like something a little more should have been done to make our experience a little better after these two mistakes. Although the food was good, I won\u2019t be going back. Not worth the money to deal with mistakes like that with nothing in return. I felt like a \u201csorry\u201d isn\u2019t sufficient when my bill is $160.",

I went there with my boyfriend yesterday evening and we were asked what we wanted to drink, but nobody ever came to take an order for our meals. We had an appetizer but that\u2019s only because we added it to the order while we were having a drink order taken; they hadn\u2019t even asked us first. After waiting close to an hour to even be as much as checked on, we got up and left. Of course, we still paid even though they 100% didn\u2019t deserve it. $24 dollars for drinking only half of our drinks and eating half of the appetizer. They automatically assumed we wanted to give a 20% tip as if they were completely oblivious to how awful their service was. We should have just left without paying. Absolutely not worth it and will never go back.",

A group of us went and when ordering drinks she asked to see our IDs, when given she took the ID to someone else because she didn't know if we were 21 or not... She came back admitting she didn't know how to do the math. Since some people in our group were underaged, she said we couldn't order drinks. Then she came back to us again and said we could as long as we ordered bottled alcohol? Which we already planned on getting. When she brought us our drinks, she brought 3 beers that we didn't order and not our drinks we did order. The meal took a long time to get to our table, just for it to taste okay, not worth the price. She asked if we were paying together or separate and we told her separate but when she came back she said that the machine didn't allow separate checks. So we ended up charging it on one card that included a 20%tip already which was stupid. Service needs a lot of help and the outfits they wear are very unprofessional.",

A lot of the food my friends and I had was really good. The sweet corn appetizer was so good! I really enjoyed the bibimbap I ordered. The chicken gizzard could have used more seasoning. I really liked the seafood scallion pancakes and the rice cakes I ordered. The chicken wings we ordered were really good as well. My only complaint is that we were waiting for our food for quite a while and not everything came out at once. It was a busy Friday night but it was a bit annoying to have to remind them about our orders.  All in all though, I would come back again and I would recommend this place if you want to drink, eat, and have fun with friends",

First of all, the setting was cool and the music was okay, though I would prefer the music genre stick to a specific theme (i.e., EDM, Rap). However, the food/drinks, even though it was pretty good, the price was a bit too pricey. I would assume that we need to pay for the great atmosphere, but if you are just visiting for food, beware of the expensive pricing. For those who want to chill with your friends and have some drinks, and have unlimited cash, I would recommend this place.",

However, I am originally from Virginia and it always surprises me how Boston does not have more Korean restaurants. They only had one type of soju here. Not sure if that is by choice. They have like a bar area towards the back and a seating area towards the front. But is it a club or a restaurant?? There was definitely more people in the seating area. The food was ok. I think the food, the Service (did not like our waitress at all. Was a bit snobby), and the choices of Soju (they did have the different fruit sojus but not different of the regular sojus) were all just Ok. I may be bias since Virginia, DC, and Maryland area seems to have more variety of korean restaurants. Songs playing were good, but the video/TV input kept going out so there was nothing on the screens half of the time. Just very loud music~",

Like a restaurant, they have a full food menu and regular tables where people can sit.  Yea.  It's confusing.  I heard great things from this one girl and have always been curious.  While milling around in the area around 10pm on a Thursday, I decided to check it out.  This is not a great place to go alone, even though everyone is drinking and there's a clubby vibe to it, it's not conducive to meeting new people since everyone's sitting at set tables and many people are speaking in Korean.  I sat in the corner and ordered some fried chicken wings.  I love chicken wings.  It was 8 pieces for $14, which is pretty expensive, at over $2 per wing after tax and tip.  Maybe it's just been a while since I've been to Bon Chon in NYC.  The Korean pop video made me feel super weird.  It featured a really pretty guy with tattoos who thinks of himself as really tough and \"urban.\"  I sat next to two guys speaking Korean and didn't want to interrupt them (it's weird table crashing people who might not speak English.  Plus, it's two guys).  So I saw the next table over looked liked interesting people.  A mix of white/Asian, guys/girls.  They all looked bored, on their phones, with tons of food and drinks untouched.  I asked if I could join them and long story short, it was a really fun night.  They got 25 bottles of soju for 5 people.  Insane.  The chicken wings I got were lackluster and definitely not worth $2/piece.  I probably won't really get food here, as it's overpriced and nothing special.  They bank on drunk people making poor decisions.  Which seemed to be the theme at my table as we struggled to finish the 25th bottle of soju and they drunk counted $20 bills to pay off the $500 or $600 that was owed.  Insane.",

There's a club/lounge kind of vibe with some multicolored lights and music videos playing on the TVs. Definitely a place for friends though it's loud if you want to talk, definitely would not recommend this place for families or young children.

It's not only authentic, but it has a super exciting vibe that I haven't found anywhere else in the area. They play the latest K-pop, hip hop, and electronic music, the lighting is fun, and the owners are incredibly friendly. Of course the food is delicious (try the fried chicken!) and the soju is obviously amazing (peach is the best one imho). I came with a group of 20 people for a friend's birthday party, and the staff was incredibly accommodating and helpful. The space was large enough for all of us, and everyone tried their very best to make sure we had everything we needed. After coming here, I don't think I can ever go back to the other places I used to visit!",

After asking if we could tip before tax the server was nice enough to void the the tip and let us choose our rate. Now, we were going to tip them 20% because the food was really good (considering this is my first time eating Korean food ) and the severs were polite to us. However, when we were all charge wrong amounts and when we asked why they server admitted he made a mistake. People make mistakes so i can understand, however the owner of the place decided to jump in the conversation for no reason and started yelling at me an my friend. He did not even know what we were taking about and all of a sudden he started cussing at us, told me I don\u2019t know what I am talking about and did not give me the opportunity to explain myself. The owner completely unvalidated our problems and told us \u2018we don\u2019t care if you want to tip us %15 or 20%, we don\u2019t care about your $1.50\u2019, then he started yelling at the server too. He was verbally abusive to me and my friends and recorded a video of me without my consent.  I also noticed that he was serving alcohol to minors, or at least he never asked them for their ID. The servers were super sweet and they all deserve a raise because dealing with someone who is so negative is definitely a challenge. At the end the server was nice enough to come find us and apologized for the owner\u2019s behavior. If you\u2019re just coming here to dance or grab food to go then yes I recommend this place. But if you are trying to have a good night with your friends PLEASE GO TO DOMINOS instead, you will probably get a better experience.",

But, given how expensive this restaurant was, I was expecting impeccable service, and it was also not busy. My party of five was charged 20% gratuity after tax, which I have NEVER seen before. I have only ever been charged 18% gratuity with parties of 8 or more, and the service was incredible in all instances, but not here. When we requested to add our own tip, since we were given no indication of the added tip before hand (not on the menu to the best of our knowledge), we initially were provided with that. However, the manager or owner decided to scream and verbally harass my friend, demanding to know why we cannot tip 20%. I cannot believe this restaurateur went out of his way to scream at a patron. I will not be going back to this establishment, and I urge everyone reading this to do the same.",

The bar area is just as chill, so we told ourselves that we would just eat at the bar if tables didn\u2019t open up in the next 30 min. 25 minutes or so, a table opened up downstairs, and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. Their original chicken was to die for, and the boodae pot was really really good too. It had a lively vibe with people enjoying themselves everywhere around me. We didn\u2019t mean to go out drinking, but the scene def called for it! Four bottles of soju in, we asked for requests to the DJ and stayed until closing. The servers are super fun and friendly, and the owner came to check on us in the middle of our meal. This is a new gem for me and my friends for sure! I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t need to hike to Allston now to enjoy soju with authentic Korean food!",
