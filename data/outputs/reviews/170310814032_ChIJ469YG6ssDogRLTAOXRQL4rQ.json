When seated our server asked if we wanted drinks but didnt give us a drink menu so it was a bunch of back and forth about what they had and didn't.  For food I ordered the shrimp fried rice and king crab with egg sauce was so good. It is true the food isnt really seasoned except with salt. We had a real great cook Segundo. Our waitress wasnt really attentive and despite being told it was my friends birthday beforehand they never brought her ice cream that came with her meal. Another rude thing that happened when it came time to pay (my bill was $75 with gratuity included) the waitress asked if I wanted my change from the $100 bill. Reading the reviews prior to coming personally I probably wouldn't have came. Overall it was an ok dining experience.",

        "caption": ". It was very disconnected as an supposedly engaging environment. After reading many good reviews about this place I thought it was a great place to celebrate a personal life goal with some upper quality food. Unfortunately The only thing relevant to the price of the food was not the quality but maybe the surrounding income of the families around the place. It may have been an off night but in my opinion ( which may not be appreciated by many) is not worth $100 per person. The appetizers were decently received by my guests and I. The sushi was very skimpy and sub par to other places with $23 sushi rolls( Momotaro I.e.)  The steak wasn\u2019t very tender and fresh for a rare styled meat. And to finish things off, The deserts were comparable to bargain brand ice cream. Rating out of ten- Engagement: 4 Quality: 3 (appetizers are what save from a 0) Showmanship: 0  Afterthought\u2014 the workers don\u2019t seem to be enjoying their workplace. The vibe just isn\u2019t what it should be for a high-end Japanese steak house",

After standing there for a long time, I asked her why we can\u2019t be seated and she yelled at me and said she is busy.  Then when we finally got a seat, she walked over immediately and told me that she is going to seat another group of strangers with us right now.  I told her I\u2019m fine with group seating but why is she doing it when the restaurant had all these empty tables?  I asked her why she is not filling all the tables at the restaurant first before she do group seating and she told me because she is the boss and the highest and everybody have to listen to her.  She talked to me in a very rude and condescending tone and kept telling me she is the boss and she is in control.  There were two other families there who sat down before us and she did not make them do group seating but as soon as we sit down, she emphasized that she is going to seat another group with us even though the restaurant had a lot of empty tables.  She kept repeating to that she is the boss and she decides everything.  I\u2019ve never experience customer service like this, it was insulting.

My girlfriend and I ordered edamame, soup and two sushi rolls, nothing that should have taken very long to prepare. The couple that was later seated with us ordered food that needed to be prepared on the grill at the table. Our soup came out fairly quickly. Shortly after that the server brought two sushi rolls to us that weren't ours. After that we didn't see our server for at least 30 minutes. No edamame, which should be an appetizer. No drink refills. During that time the other couple's food was nearly finished being prepared on the grill. Our sushi rolls eventually came out and I reminded the server that we ordered edamame, but we didn't want it at that point since our main dish was already served. The sushi rolls were almost tasteless, never had such bland sushi. Below average service and food.",

He also would give you one scoop of something, but turn around and give the other people around you 2 or more scoops. Which no one understood, because we all ordered practically the same thing. You also do not get a lot of meat. We felt rushed due to them taking our plates and deep cleaning the grill while we were sitting there finishing our dinner. I feel like that is something that should be done after due to stuff off the grill being flung around. We spent $120 to leave kind of hungry.",

Though we had a reservation, it took just under an hour to seat us. Even after that, the service was horribly slow. When we asked, we were told that there weren\u2019t enough cooks and that someone would be at our table once they has finished making another group\u2019s meal.  When we finally got our food, it wasn\u2019t good and ignored dietary restrictions. One member of our group is vegetarian and had ordered the veggie plate. So why cook the ground beef fried rice first and then the vegetables? All in all, it\u2019s not a place I plan to visit again or recommend.",

Sit at the bar to await my table, no greeting from the bar tender but he was kind enough to greet the folks who walked up after us (and was not sitting at the bar). After this fun little tidbit we are escorted to our table which is in a back room with only two tables not the biggest deal since the place was full...but kinda a big deal because the feel of being in the back room completed isolated from the rest of the guests. The table server was excellent...very attentive making sure drinks were filled and everything...the cook not so much...There was rice EVERYWHERE! I can't believe I paid so much for my food to be prepared in such a sloppy manner. I really expected better considering the cost. Food was tasty (not the calamari wouldn't recommend it) salad was delish tbh...at the end of service I was charged for the meals of other guests at my table but it was reversed right away. I wanna shout out our table server he was truly amazing...as for the rest of the experience not so much...I took my boyfriend for his bday and bragged over how nice it was...yet when it was time to sing Happy birthday Something about sparklers on a pineapple top just doesn't impress. I felt a bit bad because I really pumped it up to be this great experience and it was actually kinda weak. Probably won't return.",

        "caption": "Oh dear, dear Ron of Japan. This is one of my favorite restaurants, in Chicago. Anytime I have something to celebrate, we go there. Let me give you a quick rundown of how it goes, for the Crown Combinations (personally, I always go with the Sukiyaki Steak or the Shrimp):  1.  We start-off with a 'chicken soup' aka a few tiny chicken cubes in chicken broth with a few green onion slices. The soup is quite basic, yet, it tastes SO GOOD. In the winter it is the perfect starter!  2. Then, we are served a  'fresh garden salad' aka a ton of romaine lettuce and 1/2 tomato slice, however, the killer here is the dressing. I am not sure what it is exactly but I know that there is soy sauce mixed within and I LOVE SOY SAUCE!  3. THIS DESERVES ALL CAPS: THEN, WE GET TO THE SHRIMP KOGANE-YAKI. THIS. IS. LIKE. CRACK. TO. ME. IT. IS. SO. GOOD. And the reason why is because they put some sort of 'egg sauce' (yellow sauce or butter) on them and then it sorts of melt on the shrimp and it is like your taste buds went to freaking heaven. Bonus: you dip them in teryaki sauce and OMG!! Con: you only get two shrimps! Pro: if you get the shrimp, as your seafood of choice for the main meal, you get the same shrimp and this time you get about 8, I think.  4. Then come the Teppan Veggies aka onions, mushrooms, carrots (I am having a bit of brain fog about if there is a fourth veggie that I cannot remember right now).  5. You get your rice; white, brown or fried. If you pick friend DEFINITELY ask for more of the 'yellow sauce' to be placed on top and thank me later.  6. Meat or seafood you chose. Nothing special about the way the meat/seafood is cooked. I have to say that I have always gotten perfectly cooked meat.  7. Dessert: Iast time I was there, we got ice cream. Upon prior visits, I used to always get the pineapple sliced, which, I believe they no longer serve (booo!)  The only thing that poses an issue is that if your table is full, or close to, you sometime eat all your rice and veggies by the time your get your meat or seafood. When you're hungry it's hard to wait for everything to cook and wait your turn, especially if the table orders all types of seafood and meat and your served last or second to.  Service there is good but It's nothing special and the chefs are not very talkative nor engaging. This is no Benny Hanas type of cooking where the chefs play with the food and engages the whole table.  I do love this restaurant and have always gotten fresh food!",

This place sucks and I wouldn't have given them a star at all but then I wouldn't have been able to post my review.",

Anyway, a couple of family members of mine were just RAVING about Ron of Japan and how much they were craving it. In all fairness, I'm always a bit skeptical when someone hypes a restaurant that much (cos they really were hyping it to be the best.food.evar!), so I told them I'd join them the next time they go.  We went this past Saturday, and had reservations for 8pm. We checked in with the hostess and told them everyone in our party was here. First thing we noted was how relatively dead it was. It was Easter weekend after all.  We sat down at their bar/waiting area and started with drinks. We had the \"Super Duper Mai Tai.\" It was pretty decent. I'm not a fan of sweet mixed drinks like that so I wasn't expecting to be wowed by the drink.  We were sitting there chatting when we realized we had been waiting for over 20 minutes. My brother went to ask them how much longer for our table. The hostess said she was waiting for our entire party to show up. Never mind we told her everyone was there when we arrived...she passed us up at least 4 times when calling other people.  It was about 35 minutes after we arrived that they finally sat us at a table. Luckily, we had our own table (6 of us total). I was told that most of the time they try to squeeze in a full 10 people per table, so maybe they were waiting for others. Regardless, that's silly, especially on a slow night.  Anyway, we all ordered the steak and lobster entree and added extra salads and rice. One entree is more than enough to be shared between 2 people. It's so much food! I really enjoyed the steak, and the eggsauce on the lobster and rice was good. Our chef wasn't too chatty, but was definitely engaging. Our waitress was really nice and was on top of refilling our drinks.  Overall, the food was good, had lots of flavor (especially the steak!), but for the experience it was JUST OKAY. Not the most amazing meal I've had, but it's worth checking out. Definitely over-hyped by my peeps.",

They don't mess around and distract you with tricks while cooking because the food is so good it speaks for itself. The egg yolk batter is magical, and while difficult, it is best consumed in moderation. We always valet, but I have been lucky enough to get a spot on the street a few times.",
