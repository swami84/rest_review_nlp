BY FAR the worst takeout experience i\u2019ve had in DC. the lemongrass pho came with literally three tiny slices of beef and no other ingredients listed - no tripe, no tendon, nothing. the veggie pho? ONE CUBE OF TOFU split into 4 laughable pieces. the extra noodles? missing entirely. and whatever did happen to show up tasted like salted air, like the soup sitting out at an empty chinese buffet. oh, and i found an entire cinnamon stick floating in my broth.  i called to politely ask if they could deliver the rest of our food & they laughed and hung up on me multiple times after insisting we never placed an order. an astonishingly bad experience. 40+ dollars for a meal that paled in comparison to maruchan ramen. this place barely qualifies as a restaurant. avoid at all costs.",
