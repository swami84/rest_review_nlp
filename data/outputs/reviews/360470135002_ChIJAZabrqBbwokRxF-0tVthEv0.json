She was warm, friendly, and helpful.  The second time was a huge service disappointment. It was a weekday morning (They open at 11) so I went for a stroll until they opened. I stopped by at 11:10am and the sign on the door still said closed, but I saw a guy in there, so I cracked the door and asked if they were open. From a distance he said \"I don't think so\" and kept browsing his phone. (I thought he was double checking or something). I literally stood there with the door cracked, waiting for him to let me know. Nothing. Didn't make eye contact, didn't acknowledge me. Then he went and started setting up his laptop on a table and making himself coffee. So I asked again. And he said they are open. I had to ask him myself if I could order something, he took my order, and went back to his phone.  Then he comes with the tab slip. I reach out my hand for it and instead, he puts it on the counter right in front of my hand. I hand him my card. And AGAIN, he puts my card and the slip on the counter. I should have just left, to be honest. I felt really unwelcomed.  Then he went back to his phone and kept hanging out by the back doorway to the kitchen as I waited for 30 mins. I had to ask him myself when the food would be read. And then again because didn't remember to check on it/grab it when it was time.  You can see in the pics the sign still not being turned to open. The restaurant empty and the guy not in sight + my signed slip and pen still just laying there on the counter.  This experience alone has deterred me from going back so far.",

I can go on forever about this place. It's just perfect.  I'm half-Turkish so I spent a lot of time in Turkey and grew up with Turkish food. Tava felt like eating in my family's kitchen... We had Lahmacun, lentil soup, and the selection of cold appetizers. Everything was very fresh, flavorful, and true to tradition. I almost cried during this meal because of all the memories and emotions it evoked. On top of that, they make a bomb Turkish coffee, which is extremely hard to come by in NYC (and it was on the house, thanks for being so generous \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc)  The staff was extremely welcoming and accomodating. We even met Ahmed (the owner?) who told us about the restaurant and let me practice my weak Turkish...  All in all, this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. And I would easily say that this is one of the best Turkish / Mediterranean restaurants outside Turkey that I've been to.  Thank you for making this experience magical. I'm beyond happy to have found this spot and we will be coming back very often.",

The bread offered on the table is just what bread should be - warm, soft, and full of flavor. The yogurtlu adana kebab was a surprise and a pleasant one to boot. The meat and croutons smothered with a tart and sweet tomato and yogurt mixture all complemented each other. My dining companions also thoroughly enjoyed their chicken adana and pides. The hot sauce was a lovely surprise. Not terribly hot, with a good depth of tomatoey-tarty flavor. The service put our experience over the top. All of the servers were attentive when needed and left us alone at other times. Definitely a place to stop by for some delicious and fresh healthy-ish food!",

Were really surprised by the quality of their food - I ordered lamb shish, and they had probably the most tender cubes of lamb I had in my life... I guess the meat was excellent quality and had marinated for a long time. We also tried some of their starters and pide, and had the impression that everything they serve here is truly homemade: falafels were cooked to perfection and prepared fresh with their own recipe, same with the hummus (which I found a bit too mild in taste, but that could be my personal preference). Great service as well. Will definitely come back again.",
