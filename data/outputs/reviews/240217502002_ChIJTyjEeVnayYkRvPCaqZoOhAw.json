The service was great, and the young lady who assisted me was nice. I had the roasted broccoli wrap, which was pretty good. It could've been better, but it definitely wasn't bad. One of my main issues revolved around the wait time. We were informed that we would only have to wait 15 minutes, when in reality, we ended up waiting for 30+ minutes. It was quite frustrating. The other downside was with my mom's buffalo chicken sandwich. It was overly salty, and we specifically requested to have the sauce placed on the side, but it was still put on top of the patty, which only intensified the saltiness. She couldn't even eat it because of how overbearing the salt was. This really concerned and disappointed us. Overall, my experience was decent. The service was the best highlight since the young lady did cheerfully assist us; however,  the food, unfortunately, fell beneath my expectations.",

Please try to understand my frustration driving especially to your place after 5 hours of strenuous hike (during which I was fantasizing about cauliflower and falafel), just to find out that these and other items were not available.  I'm not sure the situation today explains why there is no cauliflower supply on a regular basis (almost all the cauliflower items in your menu were striked out so I guess they are permanently unavailable?).  I also don't understand why the situation does not allow dine in (even when it's raining outside), but all the staff members can stay inside while slightly aggressively pushing people out. As far as I know, MD allows dine in.  I am not an expert (just a simple customer) but would suggest trying to get more stable supply. If this is not possible and there are items constantly missing, then maybe printing a new menu will help. If printing new fancy menus is too costly, then maybe getting a small erasble board with today's items will save time and frustration to both customers and staff.  Now that I off loaded what bothered me, I will say that the hummus and avocado toast were very tasty.  \u262e\ufe0f, itamar  ******** Lazy hippies. 4 staff members mainly busy with keeping people out of the building. No time or effort spent to get cauliflower or make falafel. Only 10 percent of the items in the menu are actually available. Open only 4 hours a day. Causing bad reputation to both hippies and vegans",

        "caption": "Hippy Chick Hummus is much more than your standard vegan shop, and it's not just because of the food (which is amazing!). From the first second you walk through the doors and are greeted by one of the workers, you feel truly welcome.  This tiny little shop has such a unique and amazing vibe that I've found no where else in this world. Maybe it's the notes, ideas, and words of wisdom that many of the previous patrons scribbled down and suck on the cork boards or underneath the glass table. Maybe it's the art and photography hanging on the walls - all for sale - allowing you to support the local artists who created them. Maybe it's the books on the shelf available for you to browse through while enjoying your meals there. Maybe it's the plants growing in the windows and outside the shop, the beautiful chalk art along the alley leading to the picnic area out back, the lovely workers who seem super happy to be working there and to be creating healthy, sustainable, locally grown meals (EVERYTHING is beautifully garnished by the way, even the drinks!).  The truth is that it's all these things combined that make Hippy Chick such an incredible space. Beyond that, they are locally owned, the food is all made in-house and is very reasonably priced, there are daily specials (Taco Tuesdays!!), and they host really unique events!  Stop in for a meal sometime, I promise you will not regret it! It might even become your new favorite spot in town :)  P.S. Their t-shirts are super soft and great quality. Take a close look at the mandala on the front of it sometime, it'll blow your mind! The creativity is off the charts at this place...",

It had a good level of heat, without being overbearing, with a tahini sauce and fresh veggies. It came with their homemade Spicy Hummus, and it could have easily been the main part of my meal, it was so good! The entire place is very small, but we were able to find seating right away. They have kombucha on tap, which I've never seen before so it was a fun treat. I tried the Cherry Blossom Kombucha, which was light and fizzy without being too sweet. I highly recommend!",
