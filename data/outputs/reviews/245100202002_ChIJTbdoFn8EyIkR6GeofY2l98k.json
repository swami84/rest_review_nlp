There was eclectic old-school jazz playing and the walls are filled with various old photographs and posters and paintings. Just sitting there amongst the art and music was entertaining, but the food and service were superb as well.  My husband had Mahi Mahi and a tasty beer and I had Filet Mignon and excellent red wine.  This place is the absolute opposite of generic dining.  We may even venture back up to Baltimore sometime just to go to this restaurant.",

Every time we return, it is one 'wow' after another.  And being fairly skilled in the kitchen myself, I cannot figure out how they get it so good.  Then you add the ambiance, which is totally a hole-in-the-wall genuine Fells Point original, and it blows my mind why anyone is still going to Olive Garden in suburbia. (throw up)  The pace is slow, which I happen to like.  I hate restaurants that rush you (Helmand). So be prepared to sip your excellently chosen wine for an exquisite 2 hours.  My absolute only wish, is that the portions were smaller.  I always leave in pain!  Seriously can you make a skinny girl option?  I would be happy with half.",
