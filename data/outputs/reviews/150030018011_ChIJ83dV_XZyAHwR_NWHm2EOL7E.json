That was enough to draw us in to what appears to be a large, vibrant, energetic restaurant. They lead you down the stairs, past a few tables for outside seating and into a tiny little place with a cafe type feel. The outside is completely misleading for what it is. Didn't end up ordering the tacos because I personally don't eat raw fish (ahi) or pork. Ordered the nachos under appetizers which were decently sized but also a little misleading because under ingredients, on the menu, it said melted cheese; it came with the nacho cheese/cheese substitute. I also ordered a coconut mint mojito but requested they leave out the soda water, which then left me with a drink half the size the norm. Which I understand, less ingredients, smaller glass but I was also unaware I was paying almost $10 for soda water.  I would suggest others come here for a quiet brunch or just grab a beer with all the craziness of the beach or bar type environment. Overall, service was good, food was ok, beers are a little cheaper than eatery's near by on the main strip.",

The inside seating is underwhelming and dark, so ask to be seated outside. Nice view of main street from there. The garlic shrimp dish was o.k., not great and served with a nice salad and rice. The weird thing was the shells were still on the shrimp which made for messy hands. My wife had the garlic shrimp and steak. Never have seen a thinner steak anywhere. Server was very friendly and prompt, but the hostess told us upon entry to expect slow service as only two workers showed up tonight. Huh? We almost turned around and left for somewhere else. In conclusion, food was o.k., prices were fair for Waikiki, and drinks were good. Don't think I'd ever come back, though.",

The menu is what seems to be authentic Hawaiian (I'm not from Hawaii so I can't definitively say). Breakfast was wonderful. I had the Local Boy omelet with Linguica sausage. Terrific. The service was extremely friendly. I mean, some of the best service I've ever had. All the employees, stopped to say hello and offer help or just chat. We went to their other store a couple of days later, and we were recognized by the server from our first visit and he stopped to say hello. The next night another server at The Top of Waikiki (who also works at ShoreFyre) recognized us and said hello. The vibe at the Koa Ave store is pleasantly laid back. Service though was quick and efficient. Food was wonderful. No parking that I could see was available, but the restaurant is only a block or two off the main drag. Prices were very reasonable.",

The restaurant is located on the ground floor and the friendly staff is another restaurant on the second floor. Looking at the photos in the review, the menu on the 2nd and 1st floors is mixed and I think you've taken the wrong place.  In fact, Graft Party is a very, very unfriendly service. As soon as I sat down, I served the ice water as soon as I sat down and ordered it, but nothing was offered to me. . I only ordered a cup of coke and one food, and even served only a cup of coke, and after 40 minutes I asked why I didn't get the food.  I was able to get a discount because it was my mistake to order food incorrectly, but I think it was wrong to accept orders later than late guests, not give ice water, and not accept orders even if I express my intention.  I read the one-star reviews and it's not racist but it's a mess for every guest. It also points out that the restaurant on the second floor has been misplaced here.

It's not that easy to find something that I could eat but then many times when I get it, it's not cooked right, like being to hard and hurting my gums.  Then Edmon comes into my life, the cook at the Koa Ave. location.  He took my order and heard my story, he personally cooked my food for me and gave me service only royalty  is used to.  He was awesome, made sure every step of the way, everything was done to perfection and that I was satisfied.  Shame this only let's me give him 5 stars, he deserves 10.  Later in the week I went back and it was Zak T who waited on me, he was so cool.  he also made sure my meal was to perfection.  And many of the people who worked there, remembered me and asked how I was doing. That's a class act.  I've been in management for over 40 years and this place has got to be one of the best if not the best places I have ever ate at before.  It takes good management to have a place where the staff smile and even sing at times and who all seem to enjoy their work.  Kudos.  Thanks Edmon and Zak T.  You are the best!  James T",

Even with the address it is hard to see - it's underneath a Mexican restaurant.   It's well worth finding - servers were very attentive,  menu has a nice selection,  food came fast.  I had the corned beef hash and really enjoyed it.  Need breakfast? Look here!",

Basically, food is overpriced and underwhelming for what you get. The venue isn\u2019t even that appealing to make up for the prices - as it looks like a grubby hole as far as the outdoor seating area goes.  Basically, we paid $47 for: -1 single plain French toast (we had to request for syrup) - 1 a\u00e7ai bowl (nice and refreshing, but overpriced) - 1 bacon and eggs and pan fried potatoes - 1 bottled ginger ale - 1 small glass of sour OJ ( which we stirred in 2 teaspoons of sugar) - 1 bland iced pineapple tea (which was neither sweet enough, nor had much of a pineapple or tea flavour).  Additionally, I was astounded that the OJ and iced tea costed $6 and $6.50, respectively!  You can get a decent cocktail for that price. Total tourist rip-off overall. I recommend going to nearby Denny\u2019s anytime for a decent, simple and fairly priced feed. Sorry Shorefyre, I really don\u2019t know what sure fire thing you have going for you!",

If you like coffe, order the Hawaiian Paradise, it will give you a great pick me up to start the day. I experienced my first breakfast plate with rice called \"Loco Moco\" it's a great combination  of a hamburger patty on top of rice and onions, and surrounded by a tasty, but not overwhelmed bbq sauce. We also ordered the Corned beef hash. I could savour the crunchiness of the celery, and the potatoes were cooked to perfection. Please stop by and check it out!",

About 45min later my food was still not at my table. So I decided to ask a worker for the manger, then I saw my food was coming out. I had my little sister with me and her eggs were not cooked the way they were supposed to be. So the waiter told the cheif to fix it so he got it with his bare hands and mushed it around and put it back. So that was the end of that restaurant.

Unfortunately probably the worst dining experience we had the whole trip. We went today around 12:30 and found it half empty and thinking ourselves lucky went ahead and had a seat outside. It took between 5-10 minutes before our server Omar came by our table and another 10 minutes before we all got our drinks and our food arrived at the same time. No one came back by our table for refills, 2 bite/2 minute check back (yeah 10 years in serving and bartending here), or for anything else. Finally when we saw Omar again asked for the check and left. As for the food it was not bad, ordered a children's Moco for our daughter which was actually rather good and my wife and I shared the Koa Chicken (which I was excited for but rather disappointed in). My recommendation if it looks like something you would like give it try but be prepared to sit at the bar or just be willing to become obnoxious if needed to get some kind of service.",

The dinner came out about 45 minutes later. My wife order pork tacos and specified soft shells, it came out with hard. We told our waitress of the error and all she said was \u201coh\u201d. After being an hour in, we didn\u2019t bother sending them back. I ordered the \u201csurf and turf\u201d medium done. My steak was brought out well done with no pink whatsoever. The shrimp ended up being peel and eat shrimp soaked in a greasy sauce. The sauce was actually not bad tasting, but after dissecting the first shrimp my hands were soaked and the one napkin provided with my silverware was completely saturated. Definitely would not have ordered this if it mentioned anywhere on the menu that these were peel and eat. Overall our two drinks and meals came to over $75 with tip (which is awkwardly paid while the waitress stands there and watches what you select for a tip). This place overall made Applebee\u2019s look like 5 star dining. I would never recommend this restaurant and will actively tell others visiting Waikiki to avoid this.",

        "caption": "We ate here yesterday on our last day on the island thinking this would be a great way to end the trip but it turned into the worst place we'd eaten at.  To begin, the $5 lattes were about 4-5oz (maybe 6oz if filled to the top but not likely because ours had a lot of foam -- and the cups are TINY). For reference, both Starbucks and Kona Coffee Purveyors were LESS expensive and had normal sizes (12-16oz). When we finished paying at the end of everything, our waitress offered to top us off with regular drip coffee, my partner accepted for himself, and he said it was the worst coffee he had ever tasted. (I tasted to see if he was exaggerating and he wasn't).  As for the meal, we ordered the kalua pig benedicts and the loco moco before the other 2 tables next to us had been seated, and then we proceeded to wait until after they received their food first and were half way through before we got ours. We were seated inside so I could see the orders coming out of the kitchen and it looked like they served the loco moco we ordered to the table that came in after us, because my benedicts were sitting there for another 10+mins until they made another loco moco and then served us. The hollandaise sauce on my benedicts had dried out on top because it was just sitting there the whole time the other table finished their meal. To top that off, my partner's loco moco patty was burnt so severely he cut half of it off and didn't eat it.  No one came to say anything about our food. Our waitress was oblivious even when the new loco moco was sitting waiting to be taken (and by the way, she was the one that served my partner's loco moco to the table that sat and ordered after us, so it wasn't that someone else made the mistake), and the guy who finally gave in and brought our plates for her because our waitress went to go do something else didn't apologize for the wait either.  Honestly would never go back. For the $5 I should have gotten alcohol instead of coffee - silly me. (Hula Grill - on the beach with amazing views - was SOOO much better and might have even been cheaper). Major let down and regret for choosing this on our last day. We walked to Kona Coffee Purveyors to get another coffee and recoup before our flight.... really can't stress enough how much we wish we hadn't come here.",

You can get LoccoMocco here and it's so good!  Very heavy but you won't be hungry for hours.  The omelettes are really good too.  They also have really good Bloody Marys which you can get with bacon.  Not too expensive compared to other local options.  I highly recommend, it's not the best looking place, but you'll love the service and food!",

However, once we saw the line out the door there, we were stuck trying to find a different breakfast joint. Luckily for us (or them), a lady was handing out flyers with ShoreFyre's menu and it was close by so we decided to go here.  It's a small place with indoor and outdoor seating. We were seated on the picnic table outside which was fine for us since we were so hungry at this point. We put in our order (3 eggs benedict and one breakfast plate with bacon) and were excited to eat. The price was slightly cheaper than what you'd expect in Waikiki.  The wait was much longer than we expected. I understand they were a bit busy, but it took around 45 minutes to get our food. We were happy to finally receive our food so we dug in.  Then, my friend and I found our eggs to be overcooked. We both ordered our eggs over easy but got eggs over hard, which was disappointing. At this point, we were hungry so we just ate it. My other friend who also ordered eggs benedict got her eggs properly cooked. After such a long wait, we were let down pretty hard.  The hollandaise flavor was good as were the potatoes. Combining the price, service, consistency of food, and flavor, I think 3 stars describes our experience perfectly.",

I'm sure they would have replaced it but since I got takeout I didn't know until I got back to my hotel. The guy cooking the meat needs to pay closer attention or get some training on grilling meat.

My wife and I are from NYC so maybe that's why the place didn't seem expensive but for real if you're in need of really cheap eats there's fast food a block away and multiple food trucks 2 blocks away. The first time we came in here was just to grab a quick drink and we ended up staying because the brand new bartender and girl server we so personable. We came back next day for lunch. We both had the poke tacos and it did not disappoint (side bar if you get the poke get it in the tacos or with rice because by its self it's not very filling). We came back the NEXT day to get take out and this seems to be the stem of all the bad reviews, they were in the weeds and backed up so it took a little bit but people it was a FRIDAY!!! The chef who I overheard was short staffed a man and literally only has one hand was belting out orders that looked properly plated and delicious in record time. Yeah it took maybe 10 min longer than most people would like but if you really want food that fast go buy a microwave dinner. Bottom line is this place is great, mediumly priced especially for a block from the beach in hotel and Resort central. If you're reading this put your phone down and go experience something, stop gauging your life off google and yelp reviews because if that's how you live you're life you're pretty boring. Thanks for the good time shorefyre, we will be back!",

The place is a little hole in the wall, but it is the cutest little place ever! The food was delicious. Literally the best breakfast I\u2019ve had in Waikiki! From the fresh corned beef (hash), to the perfectly seasoned steak, this place is amazing! If you are ever looking for a great meal and great customer service, this is the place for you. Sure, you can\u2019t find McDonald\u2019s prices here, but the food is fresh, the drinks are amazing, and the service is probably the best you can find around Waikiki. Seriously a MUST TRY!",
