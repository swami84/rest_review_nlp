Prices will range between 9-14$ for a bowl with/without customization. If you are visiting during 12-1:30 pm on a weekday, there will be rush (so be patient,queue moves real quick) and staff does its best to pay heed on customization request. I personally prefer there regular classic chopt (cold) and Warm chicken tinga(hot). Please note if you don\u2019t have taste developed for hot salad bases you might not like it.",

The manager tried to help but at this point I was nauseated and lost my appetite at being served the dregs before a holiday. If these people don\u2019t like serving then they should find another job.

        "caption": "First time trying their salad. Usually, I go sweet green, pret-a-manger, just salad. I was utterly disappointed at Chopt. will not go back.  I ordered Summer Caprese b/c it has peaches, heirloom tomatoes - an interesting mix. They basically placed 5 small pieces of peaches, 5 heirloom tomatoes (cherry-size), and maybe 6 pieces of greens. The tray was very very shallow. It wasn't even chopped up. The salad was over $10. I ate it in 3 mins and I had to buy another real lunch after this.  If you want a side salad with your real lunch, this could be for you. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this. Learned how business is done there, I wouldn't go back try other salads.",
