I spent $25 for a \"family size/meal\" 10 piece perch which is not considered a meal of you have to add $8 for some fries and coleslaw. So I get the perch and the pieces given look like children size perch, very very small. Did I mentioned I am thoroughly disappointed with what I ordered? I can't eat fish too often and when I do I like to be able to enjoy it. I have never tried this restaurant before until today and I will not be ordering from them anymore. Don't get disappointed like me unless you like to waste money, have at it.",

I returned the old Fruit Salad to the driver. One suggestion I would LIKE to make is cutting back on corn meal and adding a bit of flour to give it a coating similar to Dicolas. The Perch Did satisfy my Friday craving for fish. The Cole was great. Thank you, CHOP",

I often go to this location and numerous times have ordered the three item combo. I normally her double perch and three jumbo shrimp. After I had paid and was waitinf on my order a young lady who has rung me up in the past told me I could get that and then had the audacity to look at me like i was lying about having ordered it that way. I normally end up with a big aluminum, pan when i do and then the gentlemen that was cooking today has been there before when i ordered this way. If they had said rhey changed their rule or didn't have enough fish I could have understood that but evidently they have gotten so popular they would rather insult a regular customer and refund money then have handled this situation better",

The only problem that I have is the customer service. The girl who always answers the phone is always rude and it seems as if I'm bothering her when I call to place an order. She also makes me feel like she's rushing me when I'm placing an order. One of the things that bothers me the most is that she never confirms my address for deliver. I asked her one time to confirm the address where my food was going to be delivered to, and she told me that she didn't have to; with an attitude might I add! OMG...What if I was at a different location or if my phone number changed?! If it wasn't for my husband liking this place, I'd never order here again. Customer service plays a huge role in a business' clientele and their customer service will definitely run people away \u2639\ufe0f",
