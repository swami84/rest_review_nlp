We all ordered the sushi and sashimi omakase which took a while to be served. We were pretty hungry by the time the sashimi arrived. I enjoyed the oyster. The toro was not as melt-in-your-mouth as I was expecting. The rest of the omakase was, however, well-paced. The Santa Barbara uni was so sweet! I wish I could have gotten more. The rest of the sushi pieces did not really stand out to me.  4 stars for the service and the availability of omakase in Brooklyn is great. 3 stars for the actual food because nothing really stood out to me and for the price. Sushi Katsuei's omakase is pricier than most places in Manhattan.",

Omakase - they are tasty but I would not expect all fish is pre-cut and placed on their working table. It makes them less fresh and not cold enough either. I know the price is relatively lower than other omakase restaurants, but I still had high hopes on it because of its good reviews. However, we didn\u2019t feel very content after the course.

Prices were in line with other higher grade sushi restaurants in NYC. Obviously, the grade of fish drives the pricing to a large degree and the quality was superb.

It\u2019s almost perfect - to the point they don\u2019t supply you with soy sauce or wasabi and warn you not to use soy sauce with most pieces.

The quality of the cuts used and the generous portion at the price level makes this Omakase a steal for mid range sushi.  For $52 we got 8 pieces of sushi and a handroll. On the side we ordered octopus tempura, california maki roll and a shrimp tempura roll. All of the food was above excellent but the Omakase sushi was divine.  The only meh pieces were the white fish and the uni (California origins unfortunately on that night as they didn't have the Japanese variety). The chef was very clear with the origin of each piece (more than half were Japanese) and the dressing used.  The pieces dressing for some pieces was a bit overwhelming especially the ones with Wasabi but my wife managed to eat her pieces despite the fact she hates spicy food and wasabi in general.  The service and the rythm were on point, explanatory enough without being overwhelming or too fast. Most importantly no pushing to buy expensive drinks or Sake, but willing to recommend or explain any option on the menu.  The only downside is that it is a relatively small Omakase menu so the chef was preparing different pieces to others that looked exceptional that we wished we had too. In the future it would be great to have an option for 12 or 15 pieces Omakase at a higher price point to let the customers try all of the different cuts available.",

Unfortunately some time after I got home, I realised I had food poisoning. I was sick 9 times through the night. I have a tough stomach and have never been in a condition like this before. The reason I am certain this was due to the Sushi Katsuei meal is that I had nothing to eat after or prior to that meal, the last food I consumed was lunch. We spend $325 on the meal. I called the restaurant 3 times yesterday unable to speak to the manager. The last time I called asking for the manager, I spoke to a woman who works there. She said, that I would need to provide a Dr\u2019s note to prove that I was specifically sick by something at their restaurant. This would not be possible since I had stopped physically being sick. She also was very quick to advise me that my stomach was probably not that strong and that perhaps I couldn\u2019t handle the food. I have been eating sushi my entire adult life and never had this happen to me. It\u2019s not unknown that you could get sick from one bad oyster which we had and from one cut of fish but not another. She also said it might have been something I ate from my fridge that made me sick. My initial approach to this was that these things happen and I know that this isn\u2019t a restaurant that would intentionally serve bad food. I was looking to be comp\u2019d, even partially yes especially because of how much we spent. I never in a million years expected the insensitivity and rude response I got from this restaurant. Like I wasn\u2019t feeling bad enough the then go on and receive countless criticisms in addition to being cut off in the middle of conversation. Needless to say, I will never go back to Sushi Katsuei. It was the worst dining experience I\u2019d ever had.",

Unlike traditional Japanese omakase this place is made to serve a large amount of people so while the chef does tell you what fish it is and what goes on or into it they don't go into detail explain in depth or help new people learn to eat real sushi.  That being said because they serve a large number of people it helps keep the price down and is the cheapest omakase I've been to in the US. The service was great and food was amazing I highly suggest this place and will be returning many times.",

The waiter was very thorough about explaining what each fish was. Many of the people around us were taking advantage of their omakase menu which is said to be the best in Brooklyn.  We are looking forward to having a longer meal there in the future, but it was a very good Japanese restaurant which is very appreciated since we have a lot of mediocre ones.",

I had left my daughter in the car she comes in and needs to use the bathroom they say no bathroom so they started talking their language then say she can use it. I was super annoyed.  As i was waiting for my order i see the woman swipe a card i told her i thought no cards where accepted she said my order was to small . Funny thing is i had not ordered yet when she told me that. The customer service is was poor.  They dont even deserve that 1 star but its by default. These people are prejudice. I will not be returning and its a hell no for me. As for the roll it was o k not great for the almost 10 bucks i spent on 1 roll. Ive spent less in other places and its been better . Also i asked for a to go menu and i was told to look online even though i can see menus on the counter. Very disgusted",

Omakase always means at least a few little plates before the sushi. Nope. Not even a soup. Then the sushi, which appeared quite fresh, well cut and presented, had an over abundance of wasabi to the point where you could in no way taste the fish. When we made the very kind server aware of this, nothing changed. Another plate, made her aware, nothing changed. We did not pay $60 a plate to eat wasabi and go home hungry. Lastly, I asked why my cold sake was so expensive when I pointed on the menu and ordered the carafe. Turns out there are two sizes of carafe, and even though I showed our very nice server what I wanted, she brought me the one that was twice the price ($45!). The restaurant made no attempt to correct their mistake. My wife and I, we do not make a scene. We leave and advise our entire circle of fellow Village residents never to visit this place. Predict they close by spring with no attitude and chef changes. STAY AWAY!",
