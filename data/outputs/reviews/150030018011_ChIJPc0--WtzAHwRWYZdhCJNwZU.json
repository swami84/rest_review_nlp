It was refreshing to get a proper portion of meat while eating out after spending a year in Australia.  Every bite of the generous serving of duck breast was like candy, the broth light and clean, and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  Big fan of the outdoor seating as well.  If ever in Waikiki again, I will definitely be returning.",

However, as a Japanese and ramen die hard fan myself, I was very disappointed with the quality of the ramen.  I don\u2019t think this place is specialized for ramen at all.  I ordered tonkatsu ramen, and the quality and the taste of the ramen broth is not good.  The quantity of the ramen itself is small for the price they charged.  Ippudo, Oni, and Santoku ramens have better quality and taste than this.  In summary:  I don\u2019t recommend this place at all for ramen.  It\u2019s one of the worst ramen I ever tried in my 20 years experience.",

I can see a lot of Japanese because they are Japanese. The location is right next to Waikiki Resort and the opening hours are not very long. Japanese menus and foods are the main menu, and you can enjoy simple alcoholic beverages. The restaurant has an open-air seat indoors and outside. Hawaii has a very good tip culture. Since the whole island is a tourist destination, the tips are very hard for all service sectors. Tips already have a tip on your bill. Present 17,18,19% and respond accordingly. I think the tip culture is a bit higher than other American cities, and I need to know about Koreans. If you don't tip it, it's a little angry. Anyway, this restaurant is a Japanese restaurant, so it is recommended for those who like Japanese style.

Usually you can go to one of his restaurants expecting some kind of traditional Japanese food with personal/modern/Western twist, and dishes usually are sooo good. I think that was my expectation going to Momosan, but I didn't get any of those things... Ramen was very bland, drinks are just okay and there are almost no vegetarian options!

Only the head of the beer is actually frozen so you have to suck off most of the froth before you can drink anything. This wasn't my cup of tea but once I got to the beer it was good, and it kept my beer cool. I would just stick to the standard beer. Otherwise a great setting with great food, recommended.",

We also had the mimiga.  Totally addictive.  It's like having bacon fries. Other must haves are the duck fat French fries and karaage.  We also liked the duck taco and soft shell crab bun.  I would have given 5 stars if not for the skewers.  They were just ok. Nothing wrong with them, just nothing special.",

Frozen Kirin and Sweetly seasoned Horomone (cow intestines) is my go to menu! I recommend the Horomone, Baker Oysters, Buta Kimchi, Tantan Ramen, and the daily specials. When I go, I always ask for Mr. Park's table.  He speaks English, Japanese and Korean fluently which is amazing.  He is very attentive, friendly but professional, and overall amazing. (THANK YOU MR. PARK!!! You deserve all the compliments, wish other staff members can learn from you) In conclusion, the reason why I am so excited to come here after work is because the whole staff is so friendly.

The amount of tonkotsu tsukemen was large, but the mustard was a good accent to the many menma. The tanmen that my husband ordered has a hard yellow curry flavor. The ethnic ramen was completely different from what I expected, but it wasn't bad. The rice was not delicious in the garnished beef bowl.

        "caption": "Typically speaking, you order ramen maybe with a side of Gyoza if it\u2019s in Japan, and you don\u2019t linger there and leave promptly after you finish your ramen. Chef Morimoto breaks classic rules of Ramen restaurants and suggests an untraditional dining style that suits perfect to spend a night in Waikiki. This place is where you MUST order some sides before getting ramen, otherwise you don\u2019t get the most out of your experience at Momosan. If you\u2019re ramen savvy, make sure you order the ramen that is recommended by the restaurant. I ordered Tokyo Chicken, which was meh. The noodle was clearly Sun noodle kind, and the bowl was full of toppings but they were also unbalanced with the portion of noodles. Broth wasn\u2019t anything special either, so I must come back and try different ones. On the other hand, gyoza and beef tongues were the winners of the night \u2014 beef tongues were thick and flavorful, much better than beef tongue from some cheap Yakiniku places. Don\u2019t go there if you can\u2019t splurge for trying several different appetizers. If what you\u2019re used to is a simple in-and-out ramen dining style, do yourself a favor and go Wagaya or Golden Pork to avoid the chaos and ambivalence in Waikiki. Great service, free parking with the restaurant validation!",

I wouldn't say the menu is expensive, you get what you pay for and you truly get an amazing quality of freshness and flavour. The decor is modern fresh and clean, the staff and fun and friendly. The outlook is overlooking the beach but honeslty their layout is so nice it feels like another world. We loved it so much we went back and visited it again! Do yourself a favour and go.",
