But when we were we were told to \"order where the sign says order here\" despite that we decided to order. The sign outside said they had amazing Boudin, so that's what I ordered. But had questions about the rest of my order. The guy who took my order very sarcastically said \"dang, how many questions you gonna ask\". Since this place was recommended we ordered and figured the food would be better than the service. Were we wrong. We watched them MICROWAVE our food. it's an open \"kitchen \" so you can see everything. My wife and I looked at each other hoping that they were not microwaving our food. Unfortunately they were. The Boudin was advertised as spicy.... Not everything was just a rubbery mess. We didn't ... Couldn't even eat the food. Do not eat here unless you like microwaved false advertisement and rude service. We should have known from the empty seats this could not be good.",

Tried a bit of my brother-in-law's muffaletta and it was great. The olive mix was amazing. The bread was warm and soft and oh so yummy. Atmosphere is low-key with counter service. A nice break from the crowded loud atmosphere of Bourbon Street. You can get your grub on then get back at it without having to pay for heavy cover charges or hype.",

Firstly, the muffuletta had barely any meat, a grand total of 3 thinly sliced meats. The BREAD of the sandwhich was pretty much your main course which was chewy and tough. The Jamabalaya was a small serving which was dry and rice was close on the crunchy side. Secondly, the STAFF! when we ordered we left tip as a courtesy although we were not waited on. Although we left tip the staff service was horrible. The cashier mentioned that our food was taking a while and it would be out in a bit. I mentioned that was fine but when I looked over a few minutes later the cook and cashier were video chatting and enjoying social hour. I watched for a few minutes and made eye contact with one of the ladies and she proceeded to video chat but at least she took the time to grab and manage a  baquette with her other free hand. I would not recommend this place at all! Service sucks, food sucks and is way over priced. Save your money, time, vacation and taste buds. Now that I think of it the place was empty for a reason, a first thought maybe it was because it was early. #disappointing",
