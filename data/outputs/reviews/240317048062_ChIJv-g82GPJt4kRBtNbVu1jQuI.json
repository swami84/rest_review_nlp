It was ridiculously overpriced, and the service was horrible. There was no hospitality and we had to find someone to come give us refills. In my opinion this family needs to get out of the mexican restaurant buisness.",

        "caption": "ALL OF THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FROM YEARS AGO!!! Went to Tia Queta today and ordered \"nachos especial\" (with meat and NO jalapenos- I can't do spicy food. She laughed at me, but I really don't care.) and meat tacos to go. They charged our card ahead of time, and my fiance left to go get wings for himself while I waited for the food. It took 20 minutes, and the cook had to bring it up to the rooftop bar because the waitress was too busy cleaning tables and stocking beer to go get it (the place was empty). She seemed to be sick because she kept coughing all over the place- her hands, the bar, etc. When it arrived, she opened the Styrofoam boxes, quickly shut them and then gave them to me. I checked them.. The tacos were two soggy taquitos- no fresh tomatoes- but tomato sauce on the top, no cheese, just a mysterious white sour cream liquid, and the tortilla hadn't been cooked, as well as some sort of green sauce- who knows... definitely not the way it was described.. She looked at my face and said, \"It's tacos\" and I said, \"These are tacos?\" and she replied, scoffing, \"Yes!\"... Whatever... So I checked the nachos- covered in JALAPENOS- baked into them in the cheese and smothered all over the top.. I said, \"I asked for no jalapenos\", and she said, \"Oh- they add jalapenos?\" (remember- she looked at them... they are covering all of the nachos... she knew) I said, \"Yes.. I can't eat spicy food.\" She said- \"One second\", took my nachos, and PICKED THE JALAPENOS OUT WITH HER HANDS!!! The same hands that cleaned the table, were coughed on, stocked beer!!! She didn't wash them- NOTHING! Then she looked at me, separated the nachos with her hands and said, \"See- now it's less spicy\". She closed the Styrofoam and HANDED IT TO ME. I was so disgusted and infuriated (these two tiny dishes cost me $20!) I just ran out- I didn't even bother getting my money back. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN AND I AM CALLING THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT!",
