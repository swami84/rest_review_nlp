We decided to take a short drive into Waikiki, The Garlic Shrimp over rice reminded me of the food found on the North shore at the shrimp trucks. That butter and garlic sauce over everything.  We also tried the Curry Shrimp, we ordered the mild sauce level. That was good too. I think there are about 8 pieces of shrimp per dinner. We ended up not finishing it all.  I would suggest maybe getting a salad to add more to the meal. Support local business.",

But quite a gem this is.  My wife had the butter garlic shrimps they call the EbiKahuku and she loved it \u2013 no shells not needing to get your fingers greasy.  And the shrimps were not overcooked like some of the previous experience we had on the Northshore.  I had a taste and this is definitely a cut above.  The shrimps are also larger.  I felt like something \u201cbeefy\u201d but I am reading mixed reviews here.  But I thought what the hell and gave it a try.  Well I LOVED it, it is certainly not the typical good old American beef stew with lean, dried out beef.  It is called Hungarian Beef Stew so I was not surprised it is different.  In fact when I ordered it the cashier specifically asked (warned?) if I don\u2019t mind a little fat in the beef.  The texture of the beef is quite interesting \u2013 it has some lean parts, some tendons, and some fatty parts which made it a unique experience.  I guess I would be disappointed if all I get is something lean and dried out.  The carrots and potatoes were cooked just right.  The sauce was also very good, complex with sweet and savory the same time.  I would definitely order this again.  But I can see people can be disappointed if they are expecting the traditional beef stew with lean dry beef.  Definitely want to come back and try the other dishes they have.  Highly recommended!",
