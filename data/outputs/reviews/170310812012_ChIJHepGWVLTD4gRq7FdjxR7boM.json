Door Dash cancelled my Phenomenal French Affair (a three-course meal experience where multiple restaurants, including Bistronomic, come together to prepare a fine dining experience for folks at home) order 10 minutes before the delivery time and 30 minutes before my guests arrived.  Multiple conversations with Door Dash still couldn't resolve the failure to deliver my meal. Bistronomic was contacted by Door Dash and immediately called me. Lulu not only apologized for the inconvenience (though Door Dash owned this) but offered to cook the whole meal at Bistronomic and inform the other restaurants who were part of the Phenomenal French Affair that she would help resolved by stepping in. Lulu again made arrangements with Door Dash to pick up the cooked meal so we'd have dinner to serve our guests. But yet again, Door Dash failed to arrive and fulfill the delivery. So, Lulu herself drove to our home (25 minutes from Bistronomic) and delivered the meal. Everything was perfect and our evening was saved. We cannot thank Bistronomic enough for their professionalism, high-end customer service and delicious three-course meal. Please add Bistronomic on your list to order from and dine at--in my book they are now best in class. Door Dash on the other hand has lost my business.",

He kept arguing with me that it\u2019s not burnt and refused to take it. Anyways, good place if you want to be disrespected, Eventually when my husband finished his plate they took the our plates. He disappeared for a while and finally came back with the check. We ended paying for the burnt salmon that was not touched! Anyways, ISorry guys, but I will never be back even for the brunches. You lost a regular due to one of your waiter refusal to to do something as basic as removing a plate.",

Between the friendly yet accessible staff, the ambiance, and the thoughtfully prepared delicious meals this is a place to go when you're looking for a very nice night out. This is only the 2nd place I've been to since this phase of re-opening. Our party of 5 was seated on their patio well more than 6 feet away from other diners, and when it started to rain they seamlessly moved us to a sheltered place still a safe distance from others. Staff wore masks and gloves and beared the heat and humidity without batting a lash. I am so grateful to finally have had this delicious French meal, coursed out beautifully, perfectly balanced, just the right amount of attention to details, flavor, presentation. We had soups, escargot, scallops, ahi tuna salad, lamb, rib eye, cocktails, wine, we tried 4 different desserts! We have really been missing dining out, so we went all out tonight, and I'm glad we did it here. Thank you to Bistronomic and all their staff, the food and service was exceptional!!",

The duck with date couscous just hits the palate in all the good ways.  The bread pudding was a deliciously unique preparation that was blended into a cupcake shape and had a French toast flair to it which perfectly complimented the cherries. If you are feeling seafood, the lobster pasta was well flavored and left a pleasant aftertaste.",

Well now I know what I missed and I'm definitely going to visit again this month!  I arrived at 7pm by myself and I chose a booth table and was seated with fresh baked bread and a menu to peruse.  I looked over everything briefly and decided on the special prix fixe dinner with a choice of appetizers, main course and dessert.  I decided upon the tuna tartare which came in a cute glass jar accompanied by crispy toast points.  It had just the right taste, texture and more than enough toast points so I didn't need to ask for extra. My main course was the seafood linguine which was buttery and rich tasting.  There were peas, salmon and steamed mussels in the shell all with a decadent herb butter taste. The noodles tasted homemade rather than store made so if you love good pasta you won't be disappointed.  After dinner came dessert and so I selected Baked Alaska which was a combination of homemade vanilla ice cream, butterscotch syrup and meringue . This was my first time ever trying a baked Alaska and I'm certain this might be the specialty dessert they cook extremely well and so I truly recommend everyone try it. My waiter was extremely attentive and the service was excellent because everyone here works as a team and once I finished one course the next delicious delicacy came to me within 6 minutes.  It's cozy here and unpretentious so I'm looking forward to future visits.",

French music playing at a pleasant level in the background so everyone at the table could enjoy the lively art of conversation with our visitors from out of town.  Everyone enjoyed their dinners of either scallops or steak and of course dessert with great lattes.  Very pleasant dining experience!",

My friends were in Chicago visiting me while I was there for work. I wanted to do a boozy brunch and this was one of the few restaurants at the time that had what I was looking for. They offered an entree and a bottomless  mimosas for a price that I don't remember. My drink was never empty. The service was amazing and the burger...... omg like legit best burger of my life. To this day I still remember that burger. I asked for it rare and they cooked it just the way I like it. The fries were perfection and the creme brulee was on point. My friends and I were in food heaven. If im ever in the city again I will definitely come back.",

As a local concierge I tend to send a lot of people here for their wonderful weekend brunch on Saturday and Sundays (Yes they have bottomless mimosas) I have never been to dinner here and this past Saturday evening decided to give it a try when my sister mentioned she had a taste for  French food. The dining room was perfectly lit and was very cozy.  It was a little early 6pm so it was busy but not full although we were able to converse without raising our voices. The entire staff welcomed us warmly from the hostess to the busboys and waiter. We started with mussels which were perfect and i had an amazing, melt in your mouth Filet Mignon and my sis had the deliciously prepared salmon and we finished it by sharing some chocolate combo that included creme brulee.  Highly recommended!  Excelling at both brunch and dinner!!",

If you decide to eat here, I suggest establishing a firm stance from the very beginning with servers at this restaurant as they will walk all over your attempts at being civil and cordial.  Review - We came here specifically for Bottomless Mimosas. We bought Brunch Entrees. Paid $19 for the Mimosas and yet we were met with resistance for refills at every turn. We realize that this establishment is probably busiest at brunch and were very patient about it.  We first asked our server politely. We then asked the bus boy who said he had to ask the server. At one point, our server disappeared for a good 30 minutes and we tried flagging down another server who also disappeared looking for our server. Our server refilled our glasses only once in the hour and 15 minutes we dined here, and even though his pitcher was full, he only filled the glasses halfway. You dont have to fill it obscenely to the brim, but at least fill it 3/4 of the way!  I will not be coming back here, and neither will the 4 other women who accompanied me.",

It took her 30 minutes to get even water for us to drink, and an hour before she took our order. She attempted to fill 3 tables worth of mimosas with 1 carafe, which left us all with like 2 sips until our glasses were empty again. The table of 2 next to us had to ask for their check three times, and the table of 6 next to us on the patio complained, and then the hostess was out filling drinks for our server, who still looked lost. It became a joke between our 3 tables about just how bad the service was. We also had to ask for our check twice, and finally took our cards to the hostess to be rung up, since we had other reservations to make, and had been there for 2 hours at that point.",

One Thanksgiving, a group of friends and I had plans for the holiday weekend, but not on the actual holiday. We got reservations due to a cancellation. Unlike many places, we weren't confined to scheduled seating times, nor a small menu. They offered specials for the holiday, but also their normal dinner menu. Service was spot-on as it usually is. All of our meals were lovely and delicious.  In general, this is not a \"bistro\" as Americans usually expect. If you're after the typical bistro fare, like onion soup grat\u00edn and steak with pommes frites, they offer them, but it's not their strong suit. The less typical dishes are what really shine here. Meats and fish are prepared perfectly, perhaps \"delicately\" compared to some heavier French dishes. Flavors are subtle, but defined. Vegetables are fresh and used to beautifully emphasize the dishes they're served with. Daytime there is more casual, and for brunch they've got a great waffle served with eggs and bacon. Service has always been great and they've always been accommodating in every way.",

What I liked about Bistronomic was that their dishes were French dishes served with a modern twist. Service was good (slightly slow near the end when we were waiting for our dessert), and the waiter was cute with his French accent. Slightly annoyed that the final charge applied to my credit card was off by a few dollars, but I\u2019m going to give the waiter the benefit of the doubt  that it was an honest mistake (only because he was cute).",

The place didn't get crowded until about 11 and then by the time we left at noon there was a wait. The weather was also so nice out that we sat on the patio, which is first come first serve.  Also, warning, the patio is small, probably seats 6 on one end, 6 on the other, and maybe 8 on high boys.  However, the staff is VERY accommodating and figured out a way to get a large party out there without disrupting the foot traffic.  One thing that really impressed me here is the service.  Everyone was coming by to refill water and mimosas and clear plates and were genuinely very nice.  We were also on the struggle bus, so our waiter was so patient with us!  Food wise, this is brunch fare kicked up a notch.  I had the club which was great, with super yummy bacon, and their fries are to die for.
