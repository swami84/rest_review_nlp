However, the portion of veggie sides I got on my salad were very small. You expect for the lettuce to shrink, but sides should be healthy especially for a veggie meal.

I love the concept and the idea of fast food Indian BUT it was not executed well and the food lacked the flavor and kick that I am used to when I eat Indian.  My food fell short of being anything more pleasurable than eatable but it was eatable. My fries were creative in thought but was not executed well. I would have liked fresh fries instead of the generic frozen fries w/tikka masala and mint chutney, that both fell short individually. My wrap did not hold well... The Naan bread served as my base with Chicken Masala, corn and some sort of pickled slaw (which I thought was the star of this meal). Again, concept was great but you have to come correctly when we are talking Indian spiced food. Highlight of my meal would be the Organic Sodas, these were amazing!! I tried the Blood Orange and the LemonGrass. I would definitely look forward to these drinks. Unfortunately, if I returned, it would be to only drink the sodas. But I am optimistic that this idea can really work if the flavor profiles of the food improved.  It is worth a try. Just once though without improvement.",

        "caption": "Terrible Experience - I placed a request for 2 hot chai - 1 for myself and 1 for my friend. We expected both chais to be served together because that is how a social beverage is enjoyed. Firstly, they served 1 hot chai 10 mins after placing the order (Since, freshly brewed tea takes that much time. So, I overlooked this delay.). But then they said that they are brewing the 2nd chai and that it will be ready in \"5 minutes\". (So, I wondered, that the 1st chai wasnt freshly made and still took 10 mins!) After 15 mins since the 1st chai was served we were still waiting for the 2nd chai. At this point, we requested that they refund the money, they again said 5 mins and conveniently turned their attention to the next customer. At that moment, we were so disappointed, frustrated, insulted that we decided to leave the place. Before leaving I asked my friend to have the one chai that we got and on the first sip, we knew that poor customer service was not the only thing this place was poor at, the chai tasted terrible. The entire content of the cup had to be discarded.  Basically, our time was wasted, our money was wasted (2 X $3.49) and we didnt get what we came for.  I have learned from this experience and I am not going there again.  On a not so important note, I am not a Indian food connoisseur but the taste of food here is like average. If you are hungry its okay but wouldnt recommend if you are looking for \"authentic taste\".",

Most recently, I ordered online but still had to wait for them to prepare the meal after the receipt said it would be \"ready\" and I showed up to pick it up. With a few hours left between when I ordered and closing, they seemed to be out of everything. Instead of offering to replace the now-impossible meal I had ordered with something comparable, the line chef tried to scrape together a rice bowl from the crusty scraps of rice at the bottom of the container and a few scant toppings. It barely looked like half of what the bowls used to look like. There seemed to be no plan to make any new ingredients, and maybe no staff to even do it in the first place! One of the kitchen-area cooks had tissues stuffed up his nose and kept wandering out into the dining area. I don't know if he had a nosebleed or a runny nose, but I'm sure he should not have been working that night. I really want to see this place get back to what it used to be and give it 5 stars, but based on the most recent experience and the last few visits before that, I cannot. Mixed up orders, slow staff, and just overall messiness compared to how it was before. It's a shame.",

I know they were training someone new, but there were more employees on staff than customers so it shouldn't have been as off as it was.  Even though it was his first day, somehow they had not explained to him anything yet as he did not know the difference between chickpeas and cauliflower.  The manager on staff tried helping and got the order finished.  But then when I asked for a samosa it was never given to me until i went and asked about it.  It was sitting in the hot tray, forgotten.  I took 1 bite and it was grease-logged so I just tossed it.  I don't want to just give a 1 star because the food itself had good flavors.  Maybe they had a bad day.",

If you're a novice to Indian food, have no worries. You control the spice level with the optional sauces. The garlic Naan sandwich is a great start. I don't eat chicken, so opt for the Turkey Kebab. You wouldn't even though it was turkey since it's well marinated in yogurt to produce a fluffy tender result. The rice bowls are just as good if you want to be less messy. I add the fresh spinach, cooked onions & peppers, and balance the heat with the Cool & Native sauces.  You will get head sweats!  Highly recommend the Mango Lassi drink to cool your mouth and balance your stomach. It's Mangos and yogurt whipped to delight with a little cinnamon and spice!",

I was quite honestly a painful customer in the sense that I was indecisive in the process as I was not completely sure of what exactly I wanted! But they worked with me at every step of the way and made sure that everything went smoothly! The food was on time, the drop off and set up was very clean and with utensils! My only gripe is that the food smelled so good that we started digging in even before taking a picture. If one suggestion, I would recommend them to provide an even wider buffer option. Instead of 3 protiens maybe 4 protiens at an higher price point. Also please give an option to add masala fries in the future!  Thank you NaanStop",

The store is always clean, the food is always delicious, the staff is always friendly and attentive, and the owners are receptive and responsive to feedback. I most recently visited during their annual customer appreciation day (a practice no other Fairlie-Poplar eatery observes); the line extended out past the entrance and back to the corner. The customers were there to take advantage of the special offer (one-dollar entrees!), but the owners continuously worked the queue with lassi  samples, coupons for future visits (though the food alone is incentive enough), and frequent declarations of gratitude. Thanks to everyone involved in making my every NaanStop visit a superlative experience!",

        "caption": "Stopped here for a quick bite while on the road. They sell quick service Indian food. The naan is baked fresh in a clay oven for each naanwich. I ate the lamb, my husband the chicken tikka masala and we shared samosas. I thought the lamb had a good flavor although it was slightly too sweet for my taste. The samosas were not as spicy as I prefer but good nonetheless. My husband really liked his sandwich. They have a spicy sauce you can get and he felt it was decently spicy. This is saying a lot considering he eats BWW blazin wings like they are candy. He loves spicy food and he never finds the food spicy enough. He enjoyed the spice level here. Said it was normal person extra spicy. So if you like a kick but don't want to burn off your taste buds it would be good for you. They have vegan and vegetarian options which includes fish.  Only issue I have with the place is the bathroom. The restaurant doesn't have its own bathroom. You have to walk down two flights of stairs and use the communal bathroom shared by several other restaurants and an apartment complex. The signage is poor and if my husband had not been with me I would have never found it. It is literally across a dining hall on the otherside of the building. It was clean though so I can't complain about that.  The staff was friendly and the facility was clean.  If we were in the area I would go back but would not make a special trip to frequent this establishment.  So if you are in the area, want a quick bite and like Indian food you should give it a try.",

I especially wanted to leave a review because the people in front of us in line were especially picky and difficult, and the two girls who were helping them handled it with such impressive patience and grace that I wanted to make sure they got some credit. They helped each other out like a great team as well... Not leaving the other one under the bus. They also took pride in the quality of the food and preparation. There were 2 pieces of naan that ended up cooking a little too small for what their standard was so the other girl instantly stepped up and started making more while the other continued to help the guests. This helped keep the food quality standard what it should be while keeping efficiency. I was super impressed, and I've worked in the food industry for 16 years. Well done team naan stop!!",

They were out of paneer curry so they added it from another curry, great! Ruined the taste of whole food.  What a useless and confused restaurant",

I had some chicken, with I don't know what is called but was a dark green sauce, some yogurt sauce, spinach leaves. WOW that was hot. Hotter than I could handle but it was so delicious I couldn't put it down. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I will try it with light green sauce, which isn't as hot. They also had some great vegetarian choices. If you go here be ready for some great food and with some loud jams going through the speakers.",
