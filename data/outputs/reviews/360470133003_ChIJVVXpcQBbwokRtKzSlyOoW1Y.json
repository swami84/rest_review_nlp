You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu but a few personal favorites are the kimchi, wings, fried dumplings, sablefish, bulgogi, if you like spicy things, the rice cake fundido, and oh did I mention the Kimchi.  Oh and last but certainly not least, DO NOT leave until til you try the kimchi. I might have mentioned it before, not sure, but The Kimchi is literally the best kimchi IN THE WORLD. It comes as a complimentary side but make sure you ask the server for extra Kimchi.",

The owner certainly extends their best service to the regulars, if you ever get to become one.

We ordered multiple appetizers, a couple of entrees, dessert, and everyone got a variety of drinks (I recommend Strawberry Fields) and literally every single dish was packed with flavor and deliciousness. I can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu! Not to mention the outdoor seating is super cute with plenty of space between other parties. Our waitress was super nice (and hilarious) and even the owner came to check on us and he was just as sweet and hardworking. HIGHLY recommend stopping by here if you're in the Park Slope area.",

It is sparsely decorated, however, the decorations they do have create a cozy atmosphere great for a date or small intimate groups.  Second, service was excellent. Tommy, our waiter, made sure to attend to all our needs in an efficient manner. He successfully answered all of our questions about the menu, and he made suggestions, which enhanced our meal. He did all of the aforementioned with a genuine warmth and friendliness that made me feel at home.  Finally, the food was delicious. I had the Hanyeos Spicy Winter Bouillabaisse, with Tommy's recommendation to add the seaweed bread. The dish alone was amazing and when I dipped the seaweed bread into the Bouillabaisse it was the perfect compliment for the meal.",

We were joking that we were going ask them what they wanted from us! Because that\u2019s was how nice they were to us ! LOL ! The oysters were so flavorful . The perfectly crunchy triangle toasts with seaweed butter that came with t perfectly brined oysters could easily be my breakfast everyday with a cup of Irish breakfast w milk and honey \ud83d\ude0b. We course had to try t famous queso fundido rice cake, a creation of t owner /chef. Delicious ! The bibimbap w seafood !!!!! Was AM-zing . Fresh, perfectly julienned lettuce, perilla leaves , cucumbers, carrots and topped with super fresh UNI, tuna, salmon roe and mentaiko like egg roe It was divine ! We didnt even want to mix the rice and gochuchang w t seafood cause each element was so fresh and so tasty on its own we didnt want to mix t flavors . The tofu soup had tiny little squid legs that showed t quality of material the chef sources . I am sure it was local fresh squid . It had t taste of t ocean still in those little legs . We were not drinking alcohol .( dry January hahaha ), but we drank a large bottle of water and 2 delicious herbal teas . And t bill was $75! I am not sure why some reviewers mention the food is expensive ! Of course all is relative, but if you are used to go eat at the good restaurants of NYC this bill was totally acceptable for the quality the food it was . We will be back !  It was DELICIOUS !",

After we sat down yesterday, all I could think looking at the menu was that I'd be leaving with enough tasty looking untried dishes to justify a third visit. Unfortunately I won't be making that third trip back.  The first time we went, we were sat next to a table who knew the owner and were being treated a little. Whereas our food took a while to arrive and felt a bit stilted, but the owner noticed and apologised and gave us a couple of free drinks and a dessert. We put the long waits down to opening jitters, but were impressed enough to want to return once they'd had enough time to iron out a few creases.  Fast forward a few months to last night. We sit down, order a couple of drinks and our food, and have to wait over 30 minutes for one of our small plates to arrive, suggesting the kitchen still hadn't figured things out. Although that may not be the case - yet again, we were sat next to a table who knew the owner. Despite sitting down after us, they had 5 small plates arrive practically immediately - which makes me think that maybe the kitchen is fine, our table was just bumped because the friends took priority. We ordered one of the same dishes (fundido) and despite the other table already having 4 dishes, they were given theirs while we continued to wait for any of our dishes to arrive.  Our two small plates eventually arrived (with an unimpressive gap between the two) - the pork ribs had rich and succulent meat that came right off the bone, and who can avoid the rice cake fundido? We hoped that things were getting back on track when the garnishes for the main dishes were put down shortly after we'd finished. Unfortunately it was another 20 minute wait. The jalapeno fried chicken was another solid dish - juicy, tender chicken with a nice crispy batter and a sauce with just the right amount of heat. The baby lettuce salad was a tasty and good value solution to our 'we can't just order meat dishes' conundrum.  As soon as we'd been waiting a while, our waitress routinely refused to make eye contact or ask us how things were - despite asking other tables around us that very question - and there was never an acknowledgement of the wait(s). It baffles me when service is this bad - all we needed was an apology, a free drink, or something taken off the menu and we'd probably be happy to give it another go - but I felt early on that she'd just decided to write us off for the night and pretend we weren't there. You could be forgiven for thinking we've just been unlucky, but ultimately the staff did nothing whatsoever to try and make an obviously bad situation better.  If you want delicious Korean food in Park Slope, go here - we really wanted to love this place and have it become a fixture in our local restaurants as the food more than justifies it. But every now and then you come across a restaurant that has such terrible service you leave not caring about how good the food was.",

Staff is very friendly and willing to make suggestions on the food if you're not very familiar with Korean food. We went on a Sunday and were seated fairly quickly. It was busy, but didn't feel crowded. The service was a bit on the slow side, but well worth the wait! Cocktails are clever and delicious and the food was phenomenal.  Tip: Get the sesame seed creme brulee and the chicken wings. The chicken wings are so flavorful and crispy. I could eat a bucket full of them. We were lucky because they 86ed them right after we ordered them. The creme brulee tasted EXACTLY like the sesame candy I had growing up and sent me spiraling down a hole of nostalgia.  Edit: Been coming back for cocktails and creme brulee. One of the owners told me to try beignets and I am SO GLAD I did! Heavenly!",

We ordered the crispy spicy wings, zucchini pancake (flavorless, requires the sauce), jalapeno chicken, short rib bbq with lettuce wraps, and spicy soft tofu seafood stew. Everything was very good. The beef was very tender; both chickens were tender and juicy; and the pancake was not oily, but it needed the sauce that came with it to add savoriness.  The cocktails are okay, nothing that stands out. The staff is on point. The kitchen took a little bit of time to push out our entrees, mainly because everyone sat at the same time, and I'm assuming all the orders were put in almost at the same time, too, so there was definitely bottleneck or something else happening in the back.  I will repeat  to try the rest of the menu, but there's nothing that has the power of the Force to bring me back.",

Flavorful colorful food, ample space to eat (compared to your typical NYC restaurant) and a good selection of drinks and cocktails.  Nailed the scallion pancake. Oyster appetizer had a unique flavor as it tasted of being in a tasty broth that you want to drink and eat completely. The boneless short rib was the best as that was cooked so tender with this semi-sweet Asian glazed sauce. For dessert you can customize the # of beignets you want. Good, but could use more sugar like in New Orleans.  Family friendly. Definitely gets crowded quickly, at least on a Saturday evening. Was surprised to see that on a holiday weekend! So expect a wait if you're not there right when it opens.  The price was what I expected when not eating in Koreatown, in Manhattan. Definitely costlier, but still good food and makes for a fun night. Glad when the owners closed up shop, in the West Village, they decided to open a new one in Park Slope. Great addition to the area!",

The interior is airy and inviting . We all shared our appetizers; grilled oysters with seaweed butter , rice cakes in chili sauce with gooey cheese \ud83d\ude0b , amazingly crispy dumplings, perilla pancakes ; all fantastic!! The Entrees were a mix of traditional and inventive. The standouts were the Seafood Bouillabaisse , subtlety executed with loads of  mussels, clams,shrimp and Uni on top!! The grilled meat dishes were truly the best I have ever had. Portions were generous and prices right! Koreans are not known for the desert but their Beignets were light, airy and crisp . Will definitely be going back soon! IMG_5911.JPG",
