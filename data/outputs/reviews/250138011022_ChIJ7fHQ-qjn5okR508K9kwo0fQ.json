        "caption": "China virus-safe restaurant to enjoy during these times. Bill's Diner is located in the MGM Casino in Springfield, Mass. It is located in the food court on the north side of the building. During Covid, the food court is meticulously cleaned, ongoing, including all tables and seats, which are widely separated. You bring your purchased food to the table and chairs that would make you the most comfortable. There are numerous antiseptic dispensers around the whole casino. Bill's Diner has a great assortment of low to low/moderate food items. Presently, from Monday to Thursday, food costs are 1/2 price for anyone over 50 years of age... a really great deal. Compared to\u00a0 restaurants like Wendy's, Bill's is a much better deal, even at full price. Items range from parfaits, to salads, to chicken, to hot dogs, and beyond. If I lived closer, I would eat there most days. Additionally, as a diversion, it's great to add some time at the slot machines. Parking is plentiful at the casino. I highly recommend this restaurant with its friendly and courteous staff. You must wear a mask until you seat yourself. My one complaint is that the casino sometines plays the background music too loudly. I've told this to the casino management with no results. UPDATE: Unfortunately, if you are from CT, the new Mass. covid law is that you must stay 14 days in Mass., in quarantine, before returning to CT, unless you get a covid negative test. This ridiculous Democrat law will destroy the casino and most US businesses in all Democrat run states. Protest when you can!",
