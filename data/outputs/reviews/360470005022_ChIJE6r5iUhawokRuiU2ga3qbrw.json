The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is because it is a bit more pricier than Monty Qs. Monty Qs also has a salad card (think of it like frequent customer care) that gives you a free salad (well upto $10 value) after buying 10 salads. Burgers at b.good are also really delicious and not as greasy as nearby eateries.",

I arrived around 6 PM on a Tuesday evening and it was pretty much empty. More patrons rolled in around 6:30 PM. The menu was simple but still had enough variety in its options. I ordered the the Maple Bacon burger, becasue it's a seasonal item with a side order of sweet potato fries. The burger was a fair size and was very tasty. I enjoyed the spicy slaw that came on the burger! The fries were not greasy, for me, had the right amount of salt. Even though I had a burger, I would like to visit here again to try another menu item.",

I didn\u2019t understand how the employee that made the bowl didn\u2019t realize that the portion was so small and the bowl was not even half full. I know their portion sizes are perfect but last week I was not pleased to pay $11 and change for a small portion bowl that did not fill me up.

The chicken sandwich I got was good and presented very well.  However the next time that I visited it wasn\u2019t so quiet, in fact the place was very busy.  I ordered two burgers and two shakes for my girlfriend and I (which was now her first time) at 12:10.  I did not receive my food until 12:56 and even notice that people who came after me got their food first. On top of the wait the order was slightly wrong and presented very sloppy, my bun was hard and my girlfriends was soggy. Keep in mind it looked as if they had a short handed staff, especially compared to the customers that they attract. My advice: It ultimately is a fine restaurant with good food and styling, as long as there is no line. If there is a line expect a long wait and rushed service.",

There was a ridiculously  thick sliced tomato on the burger, along with the end of a pickle (really? The end of the pickle).The smoothie was pretty good, but not worth $7(especially being that they used caned ingredients instead natural fruit. The overall experience was atrocious to say the least. The staff wasn't very efficient. They forgot to serve my drink with my order and I had to ask the person making my smoothie to wash the disgusting blender before preparing my drink \ud83d\ude1d.
