Although the waitstaff were personable, they were not very proactive with attending to our table. We ran out of water and sodas and had to wait at least 15 minutes for refills after asking for them. 5. THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL FOR THE PRICE!!! My five year-old niece could have easily eaten two of our plates. 6. My short ribs were burnt, my vegetables were burnt, and the sauce was salty. And our meals were warm, borderline cold. This was a horrible experience. Our group left disappointed, broke, so still hungry!!",
