First they actually complied with my no onions request (this can be hot or miss). Second the food was delicious. Perfectly seasoned with the right ingredients to make it great. Tip: request two lines to be included in if you get the crab fried rice. The lime juice takes it to another level for me. Lol. Based on my experience yesterday I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed. Give this place a try! You\u2019re welcome foodie friends. \ud83d\ude0a",
