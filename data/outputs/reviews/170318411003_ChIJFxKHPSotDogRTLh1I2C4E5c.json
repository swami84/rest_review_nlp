My husband and I have been looking for a quality Korean BBQ place in Chicago for a long time and have finally found it. The meat is really great quality, the 6 included sides are just what you need, and the vibes inside are so modern and cute. $30 for all you can eat! Not to mention, this restaurant is a family-owned business choosing to open during covid times. It's so professionally done that we thought it was a chain. Let's get out there and support them!",
