Today was my day to spend time and walk around the streets of the city, and it's literally been the time that I have had free to explore more of the city. My work is pretty demanding unfortunately.  Over the course of a few weeks, I had built up a craving for some Thai food and this place was close enough to where I live.  There weren't that many people out in the streets, which was unusual considering it wasn't that hot outside. Anyway, I walked up to the place and saw that the only seating that they had were two tables situated outside.  I found a menu by the ordering table, and quickly saw what I wanted.  I went for the lemongrass chicken that included some pretty cool veggies like cucumbers, carrots, and radishes.  Rice was also included on the side.  I guess it took the cooks in the back about ten minutes to prepare the food and bring it to the ordering table.  The Thai chicken was wonderfully delectable, and I think that the veggies added to the spice.  It was wonderful.  Hopefully sometime I will come back again and try out the lemongrass beef!",

Each bowl had plenty of perfectly sliced meat. Loved how this location is run. Everything is very clean. Staff was really friendly and prices are reasonable. Big fan of the high ceilings and quotes engraved into the tables. I noticed plenty of folks ordering the banh mi, vermicelli and rice dishes. I'll definitely be back to order those.
