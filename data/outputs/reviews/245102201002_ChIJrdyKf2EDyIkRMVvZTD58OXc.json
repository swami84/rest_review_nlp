I was there on a great weather Saturday, so of course the place was busy. But unfortunately Lauren and Amanda were the only people besides the cooks who showed up to work that day. They each had no less than 10 customers and we're doing their best to top off Waters, get everyone their receipts the extra dressing and things they needed for their food. I really appreciate how even though they both were obviously overwhelmed and understaffed they both did their best to keep a positive attitude.",

My friend asked for fish tacos and they came out cold with stuff she didn\u2019t ask for, the size portion of the food was just terrible, and of course our ketchup bottle was completely empty.. and so were the one on the surrounding tables.

We waited 3 hours for our food, some of it was cold, a couple of the orders were wrong & some of the boneless wings were still uncooked. Then he gave a sad reason for the delay & tried to claim that we wanted either our check discounted or a free meal. My friends & I work daily, while this pandemic is still going on. We wanted to celebrate a friend's promotion. So to choose this establishment to celebrate in then get insulted & disrespected by management was not our best night. Now if this is what is to be expected from Hooters on the harbor in downtown Baltimore. Then I would not advise anyone else to dine or even get a drink from this establishment.",

That\u2019s actually a great Idea because I forget names but I don\u2019t forget service. She was really good. No complaints. I ordered the tropical long island, that drink was sooooo good and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the original long island drink. We ordered fries, I ordered shrimp tacos and the classic jerk wings. I was expecting a tual jerk sauce type of wings but im guessing it was more of a dry rub type jerk seasoning I guess. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the Daytona wings those were really good as well. Everything was fresh and hot. We had no complaints. I would definitely recommend this place as well for some good food.",

I've been to several locations including international & to receive the worst customer service from my hometown location was very disappointing. Long story short after waiting over an hour & watching people who arrived after our party of 4 being served before us, we began to get adjetated (sitting on the patio in 90 degree weather due to covid-19 didnt help). It was never communicated to us that there was an issue with our order. After waiting for so very long we decided to have our food to go & at that time we were told the food still was not ready due to a mix up. Honestly after being told that we were furious & instead of whom I believe was the owner (short, older, white (maybe foreign) man) being empathetic he gave attitude right back & essentially dismissed us. Needless to say I won't be returning. Plus the drinks were trash, while waiting for our food we ordered two rounds of margaritas & both rounds taste like  juice.",

I hope the employees at this location don't get paid to do nothing.Bartender seemed like she did more work then any employee at this whole location. Saw a guy wait 10 mins to be seated when there was only about 10 people maybe in the whole restaurant, finally the bartender yelled over and asked one of the 5 girls that were huddled up to seat the gentlemen.

When I went to every person who worked in the establishment, they instantly waved me off, and told me that they were busy.

It was a very special occasion for us.  However the service was horrific.  It took about 20-30 minutes to get a drink, and we had to remind our server what we ordered because at one point she came back to the table and half of us didn't even have a drink and she looked like a deer in headlights - she had zero recollection of us ordering anything.    Then after catching up with one another, we realized an hour plus had passed and our food didn't come out.  Cheese Sticks, wings, buffalo shrimp and crab legs should not take over an hour.  We tried to cancel the food because we had to leave to meet other friends to continue the celebration of life for our friend and miraculously our food came right out.  But the order was missing items and one of the orders just never came out even though we had to remind our server multiple times what was ordered.  BUT DON'T WORRY! Gratuity was added to the check and nothing was discounted for the inconvenience of waiting for so long...  so clearly the server couldn't have cared less about our experience because she knew she was getting paid regardless.  She blamed it on the kitchen being \"backed up\" even though the restaurant was hardly half full. We would have asked for a manager but after 2 hours we had to leave because our plans had been delayed due to the lack of service.  A table full of former Hooters girls are well aware of ticket times/customer service and looking around the restaurant (basically half empty) and the bar (4 people) it is unacceptable that we had to pay full price for food and drink that we waited a ridiculous amount of time for.  Its unfortunate because we all have fond memories of working for Hooters and don't even want to return because of the awful experience.",

I went with three friends with the intention to get an order of wings and tater tots in a restaurant which was nearly empty. Shortly after ordering we were given plates which were not cleaned properly (melted cheese stuck to them and sauce) followed by an hour and 15 minute wait for our food. I've never walked out of a restaurant but this was the closest I've been. When we had complained to the manager, we were told that, \"the kitchen is backed up with take-out orders\" which showed that they had clearly set the wrong priorities. Finally, when our food came out, the tater tots were cold, the nachos were without cheese and the chicken wings were tiny and nearly too small to even try to consume. Despite reasonable criticism to the staff, no changes were made. Would not recommend this hooters to anyone give the great nearby choices including the cheesecake factory down the block. Would give zero stars, if possible.",

We joke with the waitress (Monroe), \"Don't forget about us.\" Mistake. She did. Took 10 minutes to get the drink order than another 15 min to get the drinks actually to us (simple Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Sweet Tea so we aren't reinventing the wheel here, you just go to the bar and spray it in the cup). Was surprised when she sat down the drinks, she asked us if we wanted to order any alcoholic beverages (gotta spend more money to get a bigger tip!). Anyways, we ordered our food and our table requested a Buffalo Chicken sandwich and Buffalo Chicken salad. Takes 35 min for the food to come out and the chicken on both meals isn't buffalo, just plain. Talk to Monroe about it and she says, \"That's just the way it is.\" Explain to her that the Buffalo flavor should be on it (chicken should be colored orange). She said that the menu had changed and you have to choose your flavor now. Didn't know that, option never given. My colleague requested no onions on her salad and great big rings of onions were on top of the salad. My other colleague never received their fries with their order. It was just a disastrous experience. Spoke to the \"manager\" who gave me little hope. She said all the right things, \"I'm sorry\" \"I'll talk to her about it\" but it doesn't matter. Nothing will change.  Prob will not be back for a while until they cycle through some of the staff and get some new folks in there.",

I was in a party of 8 and we were seated at 12. We received our drinks at about 12:30. I was only drinking water. Why did it take 30 minutes to get water. At 1 pm they started bringing food. At 1:10 I still had no food. I went to ask for a manager and they host couldn\u2019t find one. Then a waitress said she saw my food. The clinic started back at 1:30. I told them I didn\u2019t want it. I told them that I nor my colleagues would be paying for it. I ordered wings and a salad. As I type this on break I still have not eaten today. My colleagues finish their food but missed the first session because they said it took 30 minutes for the waitress to bring the check. Another 20 minutes to return credit cards and change to those who paid cash. Once I met back up with my colleagues they said the management brought my food that out including the salad. Hopefully they weren\u2019t charged for it because we were a large group of 8. I will never return to the Hooters at the Baltimore Harbor. The lack of quality service shows not only on the trainers but the management staff. If you are smart you will avoid the Harbor Hooters.",

She started out great took our drink order. She came back with our drinks and we needed a few more mins to order. She took our order and went on her way. Me and my wife ordered a couple of drinks she brought them back the walked away. No about 20 mins later out appetizer cane out. It was ok. The pretzels were warm but the cheese dip wasn't all that hot. But it was good. Then another 30 min went by and finally our food came out. We ordered 50 boneless wings which I was a little shocked that we were told we could only get 2 types of sauce.  They came out and were warm. Then we had 2 side orders of fries which kinda tasted like they were old and reheated. My wife ordered a side of mac and cheese. Which indeed like it was forgotten about till we asked for it. When it came out it was not hot. Kinda like the Just had it sitting around and just thrown on a plate. Our waitress offered us refills on the sodas we ordered before we got our food then never came back after that till we needed the check. She never came back to see if we wanted more drinks or to even see how our food was. Never even asked us if we wanted desert. Then she went to bring us our check and left it sitting on an empty table for 20 mins. Very disappointed from my experience today. Like I said food was like warm and service was poor.",

Tanya was a great waitress,  was attentive of what we wanted and offered us options to start with. The only disappointment was the Shrimp and Spinach salad that my wife had but it was taken off our bill in amazement. The manager (Bob) came to our table and asked us what was wrong with the salad and asked how can they improve it. This is the best service by far from any restaurant I've ever been in since moving to Maryland and I'll be coming here more often to this location because of this. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",
