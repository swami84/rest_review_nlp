        "caption": "Before I get on with the review, I'd like to point out that I have been ordering from this place occasionally (only for delivery, never been there for takeout)  for a couple of months now. Last night I ordered General Tso's chicken and a Egg Roll like I always do when I order from them. When it got here, the delivery man pulls up in front of my house and he NEVER gets out of his car (it doesn't have to do with him slowing down traffic, there could be no cars behind him and he'll still never get out)! Not only is this frustrating, he then has the audacity to ask for a tip after I had to go to him to pick up my order! That is usually the end of the transaction but this time was different. When he gave me my order, I noticed that there was a 20 oz bottle of Pepsi that I didn't order inside the bag. I then explained to him that I hadn't ordered that and then some other guy that was in the backseat asked me if I had ordered General Tso's Chicken to which I said \"yes\" and told me that what was in the bag was indeed my order. So after he said that the driver started to get mad and flicked his cigarette right in front of me (which until I got back inside my house, didn't notice that some of the ashes got on my shoes). Now at this point I just assume that the soda was there as a result of the order being more than 10 bucks or something (which is still strange considering they would have given you a can of it, not a 20 oz). I give the driver the money and he throws his lit cigarette at me and starts speaking Mandarin to the other guy and I overheard him say \"F***ing stupid\" and he sped off. If you thought this couldn't get any worse it did. I go back inside my house to eat and found out that they DID get my order wrong. He gave me fried rice with some under cooked chicken wings with no Egg Roll. I couldn't call back since I ordered 30 minutes before they closed (he took 50 minutes to get here) and I know they wouldn't do anything about it the next day so I was stuck with it. This is BY FAR the worst experience I have had with a restaurant and it sucks because they are the only ones who deliver food (every other Chinese restaurant around me only does takeout). I will never order from these people again! Do yourself a favor and do not order from this restaurant because sooner or later they will get your order wrong and the driver is extremely rude!",
