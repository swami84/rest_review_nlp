She was so beyond condescending and lacking in basic human respect. I asked her for a cup of water, while we were waiting. She did not respond so I asked her again. She said, \"I heard you the first time.\" Well, because there was zero acknowledgment, I politely asked again.  VENUZ acts like she is miserable and takes it out on cistomers.

After visiting this place on a Saturday afternoon, I can emphatically state that paper is lying! I ordered two pepperoni slices that were sitting out on the counter. My wife ordered two cheese slices with mushrooms and onions, but they did not have olives! After a seemingly interminable period in the oven, the slices were handed to us. Three pizza is as dry and flavorless as they look in the attached pics. What an extreme disappointment. Add to that the sound of unnecessarily loud rap music piped overhead, and this place is a definite hard pass. After extensive research and expense, I can honestly assert the number one pizza place in Vegas is Amano in northwest Vegas, and number two is undisputedly Dom Demarco's on W Charleston. The high reviews for this place have got to be the result of a scarcity of late night food options and tons of alcohol. If you're downtown without a car, walk on over to Pizza Rock, unless you just don't care about flavor. Oh, and our 4 slices of pizza and two bottles of water set us back twenty bucks! Avoid!",
