The salads were awesome. Evening happy hour specials were great. Great synergy among the staff. The host was always nice and checked on us in addition to the server. You can view the kitchen and chefs cooking which was cool. We\u2019re staying at the Marriott. The kids wanted to try other food however the last two days chose Fire and Sage for each meal.",

The second night (on a weekend), however was not good at all. Our friend ordered a bourbon on the rocks and the waitress brought out the drink in a glass filled with ice as if it were a soda (the other night it was brought out with a single sphere of ice). My wife ordered a dessert and it was obviously microwaved since some parts were hot and some parts were still frozen. I'm guessing that the restaurant lacks consistency when it is busy.",

While I appreciate a house-made veggie burger loaded with quinoa, zucchini, peppers, and corn (thankfully the Impossible Burger hasn't swooped in!), it was a bit bland. The thick layer of melted pepperjack cheese coating the patty was over the top without adding any real flavor. Hold the cheese please. The toppings served on the side elevated the burger with pickled onions, pickles, tomato, and lettuce. The fully loaded burger was held in place by the toothpick!  While the quinoa burger was satisfying, the crispy battered fries really sealed the meal! Not a fry was spared. Would be nice if the quinoa burger was offered as part of the $12 lunch deal.  Will have to try the stone-oven flatbreads on happy hour next time along with some fries!",

It wasn't bad, but not impressive either. Tonight, I tried their Ruben. Then I vowed to plant my oversized behind in this stool until the end of time and eat the same thing until death came knocking. It's a perfect heap of pastrami coupled with a spicy remoulade and mild sauerkraut on toasted rye bread and although it sounds simple, I can't get over the perfect combination. This was perfect and goes down as one of my top ten places for a great evening classic.

It's reasonably priced and everything on the menu is served and delicious (except the salads and the drinks which are the appropriate temp lol.)  Booths are roomy, you can come in at lunch snd eat alone or with friends. The drinks are consistent too, try the martinis. Also a great place for an after work drink, to meet and eat before going to a second location.",
