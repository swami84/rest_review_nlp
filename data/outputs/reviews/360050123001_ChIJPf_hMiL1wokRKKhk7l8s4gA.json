I had one the smoothies with banana and cinnamon (theres more stuff, but I don\u2019t recall). Absolutely great! I loved it. I\u2019m quite glad this spot is open, much needed in the neighborhood. I will be going back to try the other juices, especially the juice with the sea moss. The owner will be seeing my blue mason jar often!!",
