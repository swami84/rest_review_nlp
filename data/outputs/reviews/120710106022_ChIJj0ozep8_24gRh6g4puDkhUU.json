I've been to many Greek restaurants in town and nothing comes close to that authentic taste of Greece. I ordered two gyros, the pork and the beef/lamb gyros. Both were delicious,  brought me back to Greece. The fries were cooked perfect and seasoned well. They gave me a sauce to try, which I think might be a little addicting, it was AMAZING!!!! This will definitely be my new favorite spot in town.",

The Greek fries are also ridiculous popping with flavor, and the sauce to dip them in is amazing.   We also got a Greek salad just to try it and it was big, flavorful and fresh. A meal in itself.
