We put our names in for a table and they called my phone sooner than expected to tell me it was ready, so it's a good thing I'd not gone far up the street! As a result of the crowd, items were a bit slow to come out, but without visiting again at different times I can't say whether that was unusual.  As for the food, vegans don't often have an abundance of choice on most menus; this was my first time at an all-vegan restaurant, so I was delighted and almost overwhelmed with options! I had a couple mimosas (tasted very refreshing, and was so cute with the pink-oramge gradient I wish I'd remembered to take a picture) and waffles with banana and walnuts on top. It came with \"butter,\" strawberry compote, and maple syrup in little cups. My partner got the breakfast pizza, and based on that we definitely want to come on a Saturday night to try their deep dish!  This was worth traveling from the Bloomington-Normal area for, and I'll definitely return, but not with anybody in a hurry.",

I had the pineapple blueberry love smoothies, but banana was far too overbearing on the taste, as could not even taste the pineapple, nor even the ginger or much of blueberry, but it was not bad, just need to request no banana next time, see if it is much better tasting for me, as I am not much a fan of banana, but needed the potassium today. Straw was weak, broke and made it difficult to drink from too, but will soon be using bamboo ones for environment.  I do love this place, and bet you will too. I met people who became friends here, and bought owner a bendable dog I felt they needed, and was thanked often for it. Really love dogs, lot of dog friendly art, and even sell vegan dog biscuits.

I was in town for work a few weeks and ordered from here at least once a week the entire time.  My favorite is the crispy chicken sandwich with the garlic mayo. YUM. I physically had a hard time ordering anything else, but when I did order something else it was good. The soups of the day were always the bomb. They do have the impossible burger but it is kinda hard to tell because it isn't on the menu but you can just ask for it.  The service has been good every time also. One time I had to wait awhile for a pickup order but it was no big deal and the cashier was very courteous. Service in restaurant was also nice and quick. Thank you for being a great representation of how amazing a vegan place can be!",

IT is fabulous. Go get any deep dish n be wowed by it and finish it off with amazing desserts.

You can only order it after 5pm on Saturday and from my experience, you only have about 90-120 minutes before it's sold out. I would highly recommend you try it out if you have the chance.

My mom was hesitant going to an all-vegan place but liked her tacos and dessert. The tacos were amazing, and we also tried the Ruben and Pesto Grilled Cheeze and they were all awesome. For us, the Pesto Grilled Cheeze was the clear winner and the desserts (especially oatmeal cream pie) and coffee were a treat.

I had the pesto grilled cheese sandwich and it was really beyond my expectations of what a grilled cheese sandwich would taste like that has a 'fake' cheese made out of cashews. Really incredible. It was delicious. I really like pesto, and this, too, has been created without Parmesan, but without compromising flavor. I also tried the Tomato Bisque soup, which was the soup of the day, and it was super tasty. I also ordered the Memphis Mafia cake, and frankly, can't say enough about that. Its bananas, literally. I highly recommend, and I'll be back to sample their dishes one by one. Of course, it's more expensive than a typical lunch I'd purchase, but with the difficulty of cooking vegan, I'd say well worth the extra dough.",

The chocolate cake I had for dessert was soooo good! Portions are large and prices are reasonable.

The kitchen can be a bit slow when they're busy, but the thing that bugs me is the menu.  To me it's a bit tragic that most of the menu is taken up by vegan imitations of traditional dishes. Vegetables are already good food and don't need to imitate meat or cheese to make good meals; it's impressive that they can make a fish-n-chips with no fish but I'm much more interested in things like the flash fried brussels sprouts (which are delicious).  Now, as an omnivore, maybe I'm not the target audience. After all, I can get a fish-n-chips anywhere, but if you're a vegan with cravings for non-vegan dishes, I imagine Dancing Dog is a godsend for you.  I can't fault them for serving a niche, but I do wonder if they could do so in a way that maintains more appeal for the rest of us.",

They're my go-to place if I want to show my friends how wonderful vegan food can be (without doing the cooking myself). The waitstaff are very patient and friendly. The bathroom, despite being small, is always clean and fresh (they have more than one, but I can only vouch for the women's room). I had a party in their upstairs room a few months ago, and it was a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, I feel obliged to dock a star because though they advertise as being a vegan restaurant, they serve honey. If honey is not something you're concerned about, you won't be disappointed. They also removed my favorite item from the menu (their delicious VLT). They still have it on occasion, but I miss it. Besides that, I recommend the tofu scramble burrito or the fried brussels sprouts. I love this restaurant and hope they open up a new location to spread vegan food across the state.",

Stumbled upon it and found fresh and creative smoothies, crunchy veggies, well seasoned soups, baked fries of high quality, friendly service, and a quaint environment. Need I say more?! This place is the real deal and I highly recommended it. I'll be back tomorrow!",

My husband ordered something with peanut sauce that he liked and I had the Greenhouse soup with a wonderful garlic taste. I recommend it!",
