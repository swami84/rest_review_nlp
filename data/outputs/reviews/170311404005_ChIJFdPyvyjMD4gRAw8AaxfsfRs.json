Their pork and chicken barbecue are definitely lacking compared to the other locations I have visited. Considering that their barbecue is what they are known for, this place just quite doesn't have the taste or consistency other locations have when it comes to their sauce. Their barbecue is also overcooked and almost too tough to eat. I also asked one of the staff if they have Bulalo, which was posted on their signs all across the market. However, the person doesn't even recognize what Bulalo was. I had to explain what kind of dish it was, but the only response I received was a puzzled look. I would recommend management to train their staff better particularly with regards to their restaurant's menu. Lastly, the main line and dining area should be kept clean at all times. I saw numerous times where the garbage trolley was parked right next to the main line where food was being stored and served. There was also a lot of trash around the dining area. This place has lots of potential. However, management has a lot of work to be done in running it.",
