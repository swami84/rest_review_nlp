        "caption": "Desperate times. Desperate behavior. But at the customer's expense?! Don't think so!  On New Year's Eve, we ordered take out from Osteria del Pastaio. A man named Christiane took our phone order at 4pm for 7pm pick up. The receipt says he charged our credit card at 4:04 pm for the full order. We wanted to pick up the order without coming into contact with staff due to Covid.  When taking our phone order, Christiane asked me if I would leave a tip. We try and support local restaurants, but I politely said no tip please. Christiane became angry, arguing to leave a tip for take out/pick up. Ten minutes before my husband picked up the order, I called ahead to confirm the order. An Irene answered and said there was no order placed. This despite the receipt confirming our cc was charged at 4:04 pm. She said she would ready the order.  My husband arrived at 7pm and they said there was no order placed, made my husband wait outside in the cold for 15 minutes while they \"prepared our order\", then made my husband come inside, call me using their phone to see what happened. Christiane then took the phone from my husband and said to me, \"You're the person that left no tip for take out, so we don't have your order.\" Christiane asked me who I spoke with to place the order. I reminded him it was he who took our order. Christiane then became extremely unprofessional, belligerent, angry, carrying on about no tip before hanging up on me. It is 7:30 pm on NYE. He finally said he would ready our order.  We asked to speak to the manager/owner. Neither Christiane or Irene would put us in touch, but said she was there. Upon returning home, the order was messed up/wrong. We got sick from the food. We feel their intent was to make us squirm/give us a really hard time since they knew it was the eleventh hour on NYE.  Since they shielded the owner, we truly hope she reads this and does the right thing. All this to simply try to support our local business. Christiane and Irene: Please! No customer deserves to be treated/harassed in this manner! There's too much competition from which to choose! Not good for your brand! We also work hard for our living and it is the customer's decision whether to tip or not for take out!",

I pulled out my phone to check the time at it showed 7:39 PM. I told him we were within the 10 minute grace period but the host said that they had given our table away but we were free to dine inside. I told him that I didn\u2019t want to eat inside due to COVID and he assured me that the restaurant was completely empty except for staff.

We were then led to our table which after this our waiter took extra time to introduce himself and was super nice and respectful. His name was george. He was very nice and professional and had all of the qualities you could ask for in a waiter. He was also very respectful about my dads diet and helped him out. My family was impressed by his nice attitude and personality. The ambiance was exceptional. You feel very comfortable eating at this restaurant. The charis were very comfy and nice. It was also very easy to move around. Everybody else was really enjoying themselves as they ate. They seemed to be enjoying their meals. For my dinner i had the gnocchi with pesto sauce which was exceptional. Everything from the flavors to the plating to the visual appeal was amazing. I don't have words to say how amazing this place was. It was so clean that you would feel terrible if you got a dot of food on the floor. They even brought the chef out to meet us and we told him how amazing the food was. If you are ever in chicago make sure you stop by osteria del pastaio for the best in chicago italien cuisine.",

We started with a Caesar salad which was unique and fresh tasting, but the next course was where the fun really started. A mild truffle ravioli with a sweet pumpkin filling started us off; we also enjoyed a rigatoni noodle with a simple but perfectly spiced arrabiata sauce. For our main course we had a huge half chicken for a very reasonable price, in an amazingly savory sauce with some lightly fried potato wedges. I will definitely be back and highly recommend all the dishes I tried!",

Literally two bartenders walked past us multiple times before one stopped and seemed to have zero patience with us while we ordered. The plates were incredibly small for how expensive it was and my cocktail was not good. In the meantime other customers came in and had the \"regular\" menu and were waited on immediately. At the end we were given the wrong bill by the bartender and he promptly walked off. He never bothered to come back so I had to walk over and ask a manager for help. We won't return, it definitely felt like we were ignored solely because we came for happy hour. If you're unhappy serving happy hour then why have one...?",
