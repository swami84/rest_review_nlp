As i waited for my food, i imagined myself coming back here multiple times in the future...but then the food came.  I got a tuna sandwich and a  specialty salad.  They were not good and not bad.  It was just blah.  For the price, i expected much more.  The tuna was bland and dry.  The salad was nothing special.  Ill return in the future and try again.  Ill update my review if i have a different experience.",

Great little lunch bistro on Main Street   The handsome little counter guy had a smile for us and his patience with me as a first timer there was admirable. Soup and salad? Soup and sandwich? What to get?  My friend works in the building next door and suggested that we get a variety of items and split everything. Good call!  Everything was tasty and fresh and homemade and healthyish. I just joined the gym across the street and I was really happy when I realized that this place is directly across the street.  I\u2019ve been in several times just to grab a beverage. It\u2019s easy to bounce in and out. Comfortable daytime atmosphere. Chill employees.  Need a recommendation for lunch when visiting the Kentucky Center, The KMAC museum or 21c?  Here it is.  Family friendly if that\u2019s your thing and friendly if it isn\u2019t. I really like this place. I\u2019ll get myself back in there to shoot a few photos of their food because it really is a pretty little plate.  Check it out.",

If you are downtown and looking for a place to eat for lunch I will always recommend this place. They offer a wide range of food for those that are watching what they eat. Vegetarian friendly. The best part of my dining experience are the made from scratch deserts. In my opinion the deserts are better then nearly all bakeries in Louisville.

Perhaps it's my American tendencies, but if I'm paying $10+ for a sandwich and a side, I'd like the size to come in something larger than a condiment cup.  Which may sound like an exaggeration, but I could fit the entire pasta salad in the palm of my hand, with the lid on.  They do brew Sunergos Coffee, which is a huge plus, and their baked goods are worth coming back for.  Although I prefer to eat lunch else where, I do come back regularly for their no-baked cookies, which are larger than a chalkboard eraser.  Honestly, the atmosphere is quaint.  If you're a guy wanting to take a gal out for an afternoon lunch date, she will more than likely enjoy Atlantic No. 5.  oh, and they usually have decent music playing.",

I'm always surprised by the new creations in the pastry case and can always rely on consistent and delicious staples. As far as grilled cheese is concerned, its a little on the pricey side. But as far as grilled cheese is concerned, its some of the best, and my go-to lunch on an overcast Monday afternoon. And these women are as authentic as the real food they make. Sometimes the line is too long, especially now as Summer is on its last leg, and the tourists are finishing up. I made the mistake of going to to the sub shop next door. It was faster and cheaper, but largely artificial. Ended up feeling like I was being driven thru a depressing sustenance factory. Nothing against the staff at the sub shop down the way, I know from experience that its not easy to assemble the same gaunt meat and bagged veggies all day for minimal tips from folks in a hurry. But once again if you've ever had to serve people in a hurry...I was once 20 years old. Dunkin Donuts Class of 2005, PIC (person in charge) from 3-7, M-F Rt 24 North, Bridgewater, MA 02324.  Go to Atlantic No.5 and be thankful you can get real lunch, relatively fast, but unrushed and real on your busy Monday.  #A5SuperFan",

Nothing beats fresh baked - incredibly flaky, warm and comforting! My favorite breakfast & lunch spot in Louisville. The biscuits are huge, moist and flaky. And they get one little thing right that most restaurants can't be bothered with: make it fresh daily. Now, can we talk about lunch?  breakfast, coffee, espresso, latte, biscuits, sliders, bagel, granola, scone, fruit lunch, soup, bowl, humus, tuna, salads, cuban, sandwiches, cookie, chocolate chip, oatmeal eat in or takeout.",
