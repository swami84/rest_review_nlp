Came here to enjoy some shared plates and drinks with friends only to find that the food was quite overpriced, especially considering the amount of food you get. Ordered appetizers to share, including the brussel poutine ($7), the pig ears ($12), and the beet toast ($15). All three plates could be easily consumed in two bites and the brussel sprouts in the poutine were overcooked. The only redeeming factor here was the beer on tap, but that\u2019s hardly something to praise a bar about especially when you come for food too. Our group left and had to find other food elsewhere since we were still starving. Wont be coming back.",

For the life of me I cannot understand the menu changes.  The burgers they used to sell were actually really good albeit pricey but still I don\u2019t mind shelling out a little extra for good food.  This new concept is not only baffling it\u2019s poorly executed. The only remnants of burgers is their \u201clonely burger\u201d which is quite fitting considering all it comes with is the burger, which even if it was a massive burger would still be odd but it\u2019s not it\u2019s one step above a slider and served on a bun that looks like it came from Safeway.  Next was the fish sandwich which was so heavily seasoned with clove (really clove?!?!)  it literally tasted like a bowl of potpourri I got two bites in and couldn\u2019t finish it. On top of that their sides are \u201cala carte\u201d Aka we found another way to charge you extra for food that should already come with an entree.  That being said how can you have a fried fish sandwich and burger on your menu and not have fries as a side?! Instead the closest thing you can get is \u201csmashed potatoes\u201d which is funny considering they aren\u2019t even smashed! It\u2019s literally just fingerling potatoes stacked on top of each other and caked with some pepper flake, sauerkraut  and dried out chorizo.  The only saving grace this place now has is it\u2019s atmosphere and drinks which is an absolute bummer because this was literally one of the best burger spots in town.  Now they\u2019re serving this over thought \u201cartisanal\u201d menu that is not only out of touch it\u2019s poorly executed.  Sadly the only real draw this place now has IMO is for a happy hour but considering they charge an arm and a leg for drinks (which I didn\u2019t used to mind because the burgers were bomb) I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re gunna last very long.  You guys had a good thing going, dunno why you had to change it, total bummer.",

It loses stars because I called the day before I placed a take out order, asking how long they normally take to make a burger which they said 10-15 minutes. So I had my heart set to try this place and take it home on my way from work Friday(today) so I placed an order for two wagyu burgers, asked it to be ready by 4:25, which is when I get off I literally work 2 buildings away and have walked by many times. I show up. I am pretty sure they forgot my order entirely but said it'll be ready in 5 minutes, 15 minutes later my food has come our and my ride home from work has had to loop around downtown 3 times. Look 5 minutes would've been fine. But 15 makes me think you JUST started the burger RIGHT when I showed up looking for it. It did NOT look that busy in there and further more it takes a lot for me to want to write a review but no one even acknowledged that I waited a significant amount of time past the time I had asked the order to be ready. Or said sorry ONCE. If you had treated me like a decent human and acknowledged the extra wait I probably wouldn't have been upset enough to make a bad review.  Thank you,",

Parking was okay as we were able to find a spot within the parking garage at the business center. It was a little hard to find at first as it's nestled into the wall in the plaza garden. If you're coming out of the garage on the ground floor, take an immediate right and you should see it.  We went on a night where there, thankfully, weren't too many people so it didn't feel overcrowded.The service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food didn't take too long to come out- about an average wait time. I got the bleu cheese burger with garlic fries and it was delicious! I knew I was going to order the beignets, so I put in my order for dessert once he brought the entrees out. The beignets were alright. A little too \"donutty\" for my preference. I prefer beignets that have more of a \"funnel cake\" consistency, not that of a donut. But, I couldn't complain too much since they are the only place that has beignets for miles in the Pacific.",

It has a bit of a kick that really makes the taste stand out. Fantastic beer selection and the truffle fries are on point. Also greatly enjoy the charcuterie board. Solid place. Would enjoy going here again. Parking entrance is a bit difficult to find however.",

Both completely worth the money. The beer selection is also great, with plenty of selection for anyone that enjoys beer. Finally, we ordered the dirt cakes - drizzled with chocolate these would be incredible. As they are, they're just Fried Oreos with powdered sugar... Which are still delicious, the chocolate would just put them over the bar IMO. Overall very happy. TIP: park in bishop square, your ticket can be validated for 2$, which is cheaper than other local parking.",

        "caption": "Opening: Decided to get dinner here on a Saturday night and for the most part it was bland this time around. It was all day happy hour on a Saturday so that was great though.  Dinner: My girlfriend whom I went out with had the Cheese steak sandwich with crunchy potato chips, which are always a good addition. I opted for the special of the day which was the Drive thru burger minus the fries since the special of the day was a burger and the 511 ale for $9.99. The 511 Session ale brewed by Square Barrels I believe and it was ok I would give it a 6/10. The burger was small but tasty. Our main meals were fine but our dessert the brownie Suffle was absolutely atrocious, the brownie tasted burned and dried out almost as if it spent longer than normal time in the microwave \"baking\". I would not recommend that dessert option to my worst enemy.  Beer: The menu selections for beer are overall pretty big which is always great especially considering I fancy myself a beer snob. I had the 511 session ale which was ok and the Pillbox porter from Lanikai brewing which was 8/10. The bloody marry that my girlfriend ordered seemed to taste great so there's another plus.  Issues: Here is where I talk about our rude and mouthy server Noel B. Upon arriving at Square Barrels he seemed fine and offered his favorites from the menu that he enjoyed. For some reason Noel B couldn't understand that I only ordered one 511 which is the one that comes with the burger. Somehow he thought I ordered  a second one and when I told him I was not drinking it he seemed to get upset about it. He even went so far as to say \" I guess someone else is going to have to drink that beer\" in the most condescending way. When he muttered that  I couldn't believe it, I'm a very reasonable customer but that very comment ruined my entire evening and dinner. For the rest of the evening I begrudgingly pushed thru and couldn't wait to leave this establishment. Noel B's comment made my blood boil, but I decided to keep it civil with him so as to not make things awkward and weird. After the beer ordeal Noel appeared disconnected and unwilling to fully interact with us out of pettiness I'm sure.  Conclusion: I will never go back to this establishment, the first 3 times my girlfriend and I had been here we had a great time, but dinner with our server last night was horrible and just ruined our Saturday evening.",

My husband felt the meat for the Misfit burger he ordered was not very flavorful and I was a little let down with the Turkey Tom I ordered. I thought my burger would come with a slice of cheddar cheese so I was surprised that there was no cheese with burger when it arrived. I was told the cheese is put into the patty, but I did not taste it at all. I was also told I could have asked for cheese on the patty but that would have been an additional add on to the burger. I did enjoy my ulu fries with the burger.",

There was one waitress who I think might be a lead waitress that was always on the ball, she was very friendly everytime I had her.  Food is pretty good. I think the burgers are great, juicy and well cooked. The fries, you have an option to have them fried in bacon fat or something, I forgot what it was, but it was tasty and the the crispiness of it was interesting. I had a disarano (spelling?) shake that had sweet and strong flavors with the alcohol and they have a nice selection of other drinks. Also, parking in that building is good for a 2hr validation.",
