The burgers were super juicy and came with a huge side of fries/salad which were both on point. We also got the peaches and cream for dessert and it was essentially a deconstructed peach cobbler with cream and a super crumbly topping--so so good.

Boy was I wrong!  Absolutely delicious. I ordered the ocean trout and do not regret my decision in the least. It was buttery and flakey, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the skin was remarkably crisp and crunchy. It was served with a wonderful medley of chorizo, corn, fava beans, and grapefruit. It sounds weird, but it\u2019s really an excellent pairing!  My dining companion had the wagyu burger, which he reported was outstandingly good as well. He raved about the bun all night :)  Great wine selection too.  Oh, and the service was excellent! Very attentive, knowledgeable, and professional. They made us feel very welcome.

I checked out their menu online (very clear and organized) and called to place the order ahead. I ordered the BBQ meal for two which came with a salad (I picked with ranch), potato salad, coleslaw, green beans w/bacon, and two styles of BBQ (I got the brisket and pulled pork). I had mine special ordered because I'm not a fan of onions/shallots and they took them out as I asked. When I went in for the pick-up, food was placed 6 feet from others and the guys at the front were super nice and welcoming. The food was so fresh, super hot, and FLAVORFUL! Because I didn't have a \"2nd\" to share with, I ended up having a second meal for lunch the next day because there was so much food. Just as great re-heated! I can't wait to become a regular once life goes back to normal. Their bar looked awesome, too. Until then, I'm going to try all their \"meals for 2\" in the coming weeks! You rock, Harbor!! Glad you are in this neighborhood.",

Walking into the place, you can feel the comfort of the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff. Looking at the compact menu, so many seafood choices with lots of vegetarian and gluten free items. So far so good. The waitress was pleasant and helpful. The cocktails were interesting.  Here's the but and the reason only 4 stars and not 5.  One of the dishes we ordered as an appetizer was the pizza with clams. We thought that sounds interesting so let's try it. Imagine looking at the 12\" pizza with 4 small clam shells on the pizza. What? Then we ordered a side dish of their broccoli dish that people raved about to go with our main entrees. We never got it. What happened? Who knows. I pointed out to the waitress we never received it and it was brushed off with a \"sorry.\"  We will go back since they are \"new\" in the area and I want to support the local businesses. Maybe they're still working out the kinks. I do want to try some of the other dishes on the menu, especially the broccoli side dish. But do NOT order the pizza with clams. Lol.",

Usually fine dining places give you smaller portions which you end up ordering a lot of appetizers or sides but their portions were plenty enough and the price was not bad at all for the quality and quantity of the food. I also appreciated the fact that the servers didn\u2019t push us to order more than what we needed. They are family/kid  friendly, but they do not have a separate kid\u2019s menu (they have mac & cheese as a side which worked perfect for our son).

The decor and the bar, the open kitchen, the cutlery, all very nice.  Second, the waiting staff treated us like family. I am the kind of person who never knows what to order, so I really appreciate when the staff can recommend something.  Third and last, the food was outstanding. We had the NY strip, the duck ballotine, the walleye. We also tried the broccoli, the poutine, the lentil falafel and the frisee salad. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. There is a special kind of pleasure you get from a meal when you know there is refinement and care into it.  I am very happy for the South Loop, this is the kind of spot it needed!",

Even the bathrooms are pretty! \ud83d\ude02  We had: Fried Chicken & Pickle Pizza, Black Cod w/ mushroom side, Sausage Pizza w/ Mac & Cheese side, Vodka drinks and Gin drinks. All were superb. The Mac & Cheese is made w/ smoked gouda and you can \u201cfeel\u201d it as my friend says\u2014It\u2019s a must get. The fried chicken and pickle pizza (made w/ havarti cheese) is all that I had hoped for and more. \u2764\ufe0f I wanted to get a pic of the Black Cod but my huds ate it SO fast I couldn\u2019t.

My dining partner swore the steak was the best she had ever had.  She shared a bite and I agree!  Overall, amazing flavors , beautiful atmosphere and excellent service.  You should definitely go to Harbor!",
