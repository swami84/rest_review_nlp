Four of us shared the sampler mezze plate, which I highly recommend, as well as the stuffed chicken (two of us) and the chicken shish. (Three mains for four people and we had food left over). We were pretty full but decided on dessert and it put the meal over the top. Chocolate torte (incredibly dense) and Kurdish baklava (very different from traditional baklava but everyone raved). Try to save room for any of the desserts. Glad to see restaurants re-opening. They do a very good job with table spacing and masks. A great night out.",

Smorgasbord is the definition of an Iraqi/Kurdish breakfast, and bread is used not only for the jams, but to scoop up the eggs - like little handheld sandwiches. This is authentic, this is delicious.

I hope Lakeview has more restaurants like this one, although I'll know for sure once I've tried their food. Although, in my case, I already know that I'll like all of the Kurdish men\u00fa items we discussed there tonight.  I wasn't sure if I should pay just for their men\u00fa delivery presentation, as their spokesperson and staff member tonight seemed so high end.  Not all of the restaurants in Lakeview know their food, but the Gundy's (g\u014d\u014dndi\u0113s) Kurdish Kitchen sure do.  Lakeview needs more restaurants like this one.  It's always a good sign when the staff know their food and line of work, and the person there really impressed me tonight with her speaking skills and delivery. She knew that men\u00fa like the back of her hand.  That's always a sign of an establishment with outstanding cuisine.  Luckily, for all of us out here in Lakeview, The Gundy's (g\u014d\u014dndi\u0113s) Kurdish Kitchen has now arrived.  And it's about time.  Hopefully, I''ll see the girl I met there tonight again, although she looks and sounds like she might be on television next. I definitely think she's planning to do something like that, based on how that men\u00fa presentation and conversation went.  She's practiced that one before.  I'm wondering if she's been on the news discussing this restaurant's cuisine, or planning for it, and someone let me know if she has: because I actually don't own a television.  I just saw it passing by and it looked good.  She definitely seems like she is preparing, or has already done a TV spot discussing this place's refined cuisine and restaurant men\u00fa.",

The good: The chicken sac tawa was great - it had the perfect amount of spice so it wasn't too hot, and it had a nice marinade to it. The mix of charred/sauteed peppers and onions in combination with the spiced chicken gave a well-balanced flavor. Having the bulgar on top and the bread on the side was smart so neither absorbed the juices (both were also great). The portion sizes are generous as well.  The not-so-good: For a delivery option, the cost is a bit much. The ambiance of the restaurant and the freshness of the food would help justify it a little bit, but to pay almost $30 for one person is a bit much. But, it did help that I had enough leftover for lunch the next day. The delivery was also almost 45 mins late, but I don't blame that on the restaurant and rather the 3rd party app.",

We started with the sampler appetizer plate which was pretty good, specifically the baba ghanouj that came in the plate. For entrees we had the lamb shank, lamb shish kabob, and chicken shish kabob. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the vegetables that came with the lamb shank as they seemed oil drenched with not much flavor. The lamb shank itself was delicious. Both shish kabobs came well prepared and plated. A good experience but a little pricey for the level of food served. Would recommend trying if you\u2019re in the area but I personally wouldn\u2019t go out of my way.",

For brunch, they offer \"The Kurdish Breakfast\" for 2 which includes a scramble of your choice and many sides including cheese, jams, bottomless Kurdish tea, etc for ~$40. The spread looks beautiful in pics and as tempting as this option was (mostly cause it's so pretty!) we decided to order separate items instead because we didn't care for getting a bunch of different jams, honey, olives, cucumbers, etc in place of other main dishes. They have so many good options for brunch! We ended up getting the the soft scramble with lamb ($15.95, comes with French fries), baba ganoush ($7.95), and the Kurdish bakhlawa crepes ($11.95, comes with a side of fruits). All of these dishes were wonderful! The baba ganoush was the best I've ever had. Some reviewers mentioned the bakhlawa crepes are too sweet but I didn't think so. I thought they were just the right level of sweetness and I appreciated the generous topping of pistachios sprinkled on top. Both of these were very reasonably priced. I thought the scramble was just a bit overpriced but it was a good sized portion and easily shareable between the two of us.  I also tried the Kurdish coffee which comes in the most adorable little tea cup. We also wanted to try the grilled halloumi cheese but it took some willpower to say no to this since adding this would've resulted in too much food for two people.  Some of the reviews mentioned that their dinner is pricey so not sure about that but brunch is definitely worth checking out! I had reservations for Saturday morning but even if you came without one I don't think there would be much of a wait. Which is a big plus when you're looking for a brunch spot in Chicago! Also the ambiance is pretty and service was great.",

We also got the grill calamari which I recommend and I also recommend taking the bread and dipping it into the sauce... yummy! I got the mardin lamb special. It was okay the 2 sauces worked well together, however 2 of my friends got the lamb shanks, that was the best pick. The lamb was just so fall of the bone and the favors were on point. Definitely do dessert and the Kurdish coffee. The Kurdish coffee was creamy and sweet (a good balance of sweet and not over powering sweet). We got the dark chocolate mousse with Pomegranate drizzle... just get it. If you like dark chocolate you will be in heaven. It\u2019s a good size you can share with 2-3 peeps if you are just looking for a little bit of dessert. Overall this is a great like gem in lakeview! We will visit again to brunch.",

Both served with freshly baked whole wheat bread, olives and house fries. Everything was so tasty.. We ordered Kurdish tea (which is the same as Arabic/Turkish/Persian black tea) and it was so good. Personally, next time I would get only the bread with their BLACK olives (green olives were just OK here), house cheese and tea. It is definitely not your typical regular brunch.  Olives Olives are sacred to me. They burst in vitamins, righteous lipids, essential minerals, significant iron, antioxidants/oleic acid (protects against aging, dementia and wrinkles).  And they're so tasty with hot black tea like the one served here.. You should eat at least 1 olive a day..  Atmosphere Classic, clean and standard place. Parking was a piece of cake, but it was a snowy super bowl Sunday!. Love the snow fall outside while enjoying a hot cup of tea inside.  Staff and service Professional and friendly. Prices are very reasonable.  If you're looking for a healthy, tasty, out-of-routine weekend brunch, The Gundis is a lovely option. Remember to get the black tea and the black olives. And read my lecture about the importance of olives as above..",
