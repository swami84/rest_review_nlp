They seated a couple, took another individuals order and helped another person with a pickup without even acknowledging that I was there.  I stood around for 20 minutes, none of them made any effort to help me, despite me trying to flag them down. The only visible difference between me and the other patrons was that I was black, and they were not. I'm not making any accusations, but that's the simple fact of the matter. I was the only black person in the establishment, and also the only person who did not receive any service. I left without my pick up order.

With respect to timing I was really impressed as was 5-10 minutes before the predicted time (which is always a benefit when you consider how I always order when I\u2019m already starving). This haste on its own is a massive benefit. Moreover the food itself was a pleasant reminder of how skilled the chefs are here. I got the Panag curry which is my general go to. With this dish they are able to make something really special by blending just the right amounts of flavor with spice you are able to get an y forgettable dish without the unpleasant experience of the spice overpowering the dish. Would definitely recommend as my go to Thai place in Washington heights.",

The customer friendly thing to do is call the restaurant and inform them of this issue. Upon calling and stating the order was incomplete. We were questioned several times as to whether or not we missed it in the bag. We order 6 items, received 5, how do you miss it when its clearly not present. The manager proceeded to continue to tell us how the packer stated it was in there. How she would have to pay the money back out of her pocket for the item. And if I wanted to receive what I paid for it would take longer since my location was far and the delivery person was still out delivering. That's when enough was enough and the final request was to refund the amount of the item along with the tax! I told her if I had not called you would have had my money and my food item in your possession and you would not have called me to return either one. GIVE ME MY MONEY! Seamless called from Chicago and returned my $7.62. And we made it known she had the audacity to continually not believe us. We spent almost $50 for lunch we want what we paid for simple as that.

The restaurant was spacious and looked nice, and they had a lunch special which is always appreciated. I ordered a spring roll, and unfortunately it came out with the sweet & sour sauce already on top of the roll, which made the normally crispy outside soggy. I ordered the Thai basil fried rice, as to me that is the benchmark against which all Thai food is judged. The only positive thing I can say about the dish is that it came out hot. There was no color in the bowl, it came with one cross section of a green pepper and two small cross sections of a long hot pepper. It was very bland boring.  As a spice lover, I asked for the spice rack, and what I got was the all too familiar garlic sriracha. Needing more spice, I asked for some more peppers to put in the dish. Our waitress informed me they don't have any on hand. I asked if they could bring me some from the kitchen, and the response was unbelievable: they would have to charge me more for extra long hot peppers. Absolutely egregious. I have to pay more because I didn't have an option to choose how spicy my dish was like in most Thai places, and got two tiny pieces of hot pepper? Shocking.  In recap: lost one star for wanting to charge me more for hot peppers, lost one star for the bland food, and lost a third star for slow and inattentive service, despite an almost empty restaurant.  Don't believe the reviews, this is not a 4.5 star Thai restaurant. Another shame for the dining desert that is the Washington Heights area.",

For an entree I had the pineapple fried rice with a side of sweet chili Thai sauce and It couldn\u2019t have been any better. I never seen such a combination of flavors put together so magically. It hit the spot. I also tried the Tom Kha soup which is a coconut and mushroom soup. That doesn\u2019t sound so nice but don\u2019t be fooled! That was one of the best soups I had in my LIFE!

I ate one third and then had to go. Whomever packed my leftovers THREW OUT some of it so it could fit into a much smaller container. The size of the meal, though a lunch special, is clearly an entree. It's a lot. BUT I got leftovers that added up to the amount of a very small soup. I pay for the meal and that means all of it and therefore I expect to keep all of what I pay for. This is one of those places that, though everything else seems great, will try to throw out any bit of your food without asking the customer to fit it into the smallest containers they have. In fact, they will say nothing at all. That's just shameful.  This time i had to let it pass...Next time, however, my people and I will have to pack our own leftovers.",

The people who work here are nice and the restaurant is efficient, although considering that there were only 4  other people in the entire restaurant, it was expected. Yes, 4 people in the entire restaurant at prime dining time of 7:30PM should have been a warning sign, but I walked too far to turn around. I would highly suggest you avoid this restaurant until they are able to find a new chef.",
