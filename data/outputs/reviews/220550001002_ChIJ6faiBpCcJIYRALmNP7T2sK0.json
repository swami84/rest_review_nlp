We did a side of a chocolate chip pancake and a side of gumbo. The power was out when we arrived but it honestly just added to the quaint and calm environment. The service was very nice, despite having read warnings of horrendous wait times. We were seated immediately and didn't have to wait long for anything we needed. The praline bacon was what dreams are made of, but we were a little surprised to see it only came with 2 full pieces for the entire appetizer. Definitely recommend!!",

Most enjoyable of all was the Cajun Benedict.  I hesitated ordering it, worrying the bread would be mushy in texture.  The cheese kept the structure of the bread.  The dark roux gumbo was perfect.

Pair it with their praline bacon and you\u2019re in for a delightful treat.  Our waiter, LJ was attentive, knowledgeable and super friendly he is a great server. We also asked some specific questions about the ingredients in some menu items as our daughter has a large amount of food allergies.

We spent 1,5 hours in this place, taking an hour between being seated, and getting our food.  So don't go here if you're in a hurry. But if you have the time do check it out.  --- Edit  Went again today, knowing full well that it was going to be a long wait. The food really is amazing. And dare I say, worth the wait.

The waiters tended to prioritize people ordering drinks before those who aren't, which makes sense as for the most part; however, it took us thirty minutes to order and the only reason it didn't take longer was I asked a waitress as we were walking by if she could find our waitress for us. She asked us for our waitress's name or what she looked like. I couldn't even say because we had been handed around so many times to so many different waitresses. The food then took another forty minutes to come out. During this time, my waitress asked me if I wanted more coffee, then she forgot to bring it to me. Part of this is not her fault. With the amount of drinks being served here, the restaurant desperately needs to hire more waitstaff. In addition, I ordered eggs benedict and couldn't even eat more than three bites due to the roux being so disgustingly dark. There wasn't even bread on the side or any rice to break through the immense oil from the roux. Overall, this was a terrible experience.",

We didn\u2019t have a large party either, just the two of us eating at the bar. When we asked about the food at the 45 minute mark, the waitress informed us it usually takes 30-45 minutes to get food out. I\u2019m not going to touch much on how crazy that is, they must have one cook in the kitchen. I will say however, we proceeded to wait another 15 minutes on top of asking her to check on our food before we got it. I\u2019ve never felt the need to leave a negative review before, but this place was honestly garbage in terms of literally everything. Just wild, place needs to change something.",

We finally received our order after 1:00 pm. It tooks over 40 minutes. The last time I went for lunch, they took so long that my friend had to leave before he even received his food.

However upon arrival we had a 10 minute wait to be seated when there were at least three tables available that needed to be cleaned. There was really no sense of urgency to get us seated and made the situation feel somewhat awkward. Out appetizer of Truffle Fries came out relatively quickly and were very good. Once we ordered our food the service was very slow. I did not time how long it took our food to come out but it was much longer than usual. Not only did the food take an extensive amount of time but it did not all come out at the same time. Food was very good and had a great presentation. Overall this restaurant has unlimited potential because of the setting they have created and the unique food that they serve but they must do better in regards to the timing of their service.",

The chicken and waffle was covered in syrup, which literally taste so sweet that it was unbearable. I would never come back again for the food. Everything tastes way too much out of proportion in terms of taste.",

The restaurant was not packed, and several people who arrived after us received their food before we did. The waitress seemed to be avoiding our table, and would quickly replace our drinks without asking us how we we're doing. Once the food did arrive, it was very good, but I'm not sure if that's because we were so hungry anything would have tasted amazing. I would be less irritated by the situation if we would have just been informed there was a delay, instead of ignoring us. Bottom line, food is very tasty, but the service leaves something to be desired.",

In a state of confusion we told him...sir we ordered coffee and unsweet tea over 20 mins ago. Now mind you...the place was not busy. Again we wait. Finally drinks! My husband puts his sweet in low in his tea with lemon and discovers the tea is not tea but coffee?!?!?!? So by this time i start to see my husbands face turn red. I told him to simmer down and to tell the waiter. He tells the waiter...hey dude...smell my tea. The waiter smells and says...dude thats sooo coffee! How did i do that?! Sorry man my bad?!?! Thats when i looked at my husband as the waiter walked off and said...Baby...he is definitely on something! The guy was drenched in sweat and almost slurring in his speech. Overall the sevice was HORRIBLE!!! However, the food was good and the atmosphere we loved. Will we go back? Its hard to say!",

This tells me they sat under the warmer for an extended period of time. And because they had sat under the warmer, the cheese on my husband's waffles had started to separate and was unappetizing.  The waitstaff was fine? Nothing to write home about but in their defese I believe they were understaffed. And a petty complaint, why does 90% of the menu have to be pork based? I'm highly allergic to pork and I could only eat a few things.",

Coming from California I had never had anything like it and it was delicious. The place was very cozy and rustic and had a really cool vibe to it. The food and the place stole the show. However, it is hard to overlook how slow the food came out and the lack of service that we received. It was very unorganized and although our waitor was nice, he was always rushing to do the next thing rather than focusing on us and I saw that in the other workers as well. We went when there was only about 8 other people in the restaurant and most of them had their food already and it took our food around a half an hour to come out which felt kind of ridiculous. Like I said, when the food did come out, we did not regret waiting. The food outshines the negatives of the place and I would definitely go back.",

I\u2019ve frequented The French Press fairly often and more often than not I\u2019ve been  happy overall with the service. Today I sat down at around 12:15, ordered around 12:25 and received my food at 1:55. Being completely honest, they were nearly fully occupied (one or two tables were vacant I believe). I still think that one hour and forty minutes is an insanely long amount of time to wait despite the amount of customers present. In that time period our waiter appeared once and then vanished into the ether. He did however drop by our table every two minutes like clockwork after the food had arrived.  Tldr; The food is great and you usually don\u2019t have to wait more than 20-30 minutes. IF, you do have to wait, you\u2019re really out of luck...",

Any business who has a major known problem (like outrageous wait times) will seek to rectify its problem for the sake of its patronage. There\u2019s likely a problem with the food preparation or the kitchen layout or the ordering system; something. But the French press doesn\u2019t seek such a solution. The staff know there\u2019s a problem, the customers feel the effects of that problem and the owners indirectly feel it because of the lack of turnover in the tables and the revenue that goes with it because customers literally spend half their day getting lunch. The sad part is, it is impossible to not feel a sense of complete disregard for you, the client. An arrogance that\u2019s so thick in the air you can almost taste it.",

We were seated around 12:00 (after waiting about 45 minutes which is to be expected at a Sunday brunch spot). Our waitress, to her credit, was very attentive and we were never lacking in drinks. The food service was just SO SO slow. We didn't receive food until at least 1:30. There was a point at which we looked around the restaurant and not a single person had food on their table. That is so unacceptable. The menu items are not special enough to warrant this. I cannot even imagine how small their kitchen must be to result in an entire restaurant not having food and then individual plates SLOWLY trickling out one at a time. Our table of 5 didn't even receive all five meals at once when they finally arrived. Again, the food is very very good, but I don't think we'll be coming back or recommending this place until the food service has improved. How frustrating for the wait staff to have to apologize to every single table for the unreasonable food wait times.",

This place came highly recommended, and we frequent Lafayette for casual getaways; as a result, we always try to find new food experiences to try and were super excited to try their unique twist on favorite southern dishes.  We paid for an hour of parking at the meter knowing in advance we would have to wait.  We came at a busy time, though there were 2 tables available.  One very close to the front.  When one of the staff (probably the bartender) came to greet us she asked how many and said she would be right with us.  My husband very kindly asked if we could sit at the table that was open near the door.  She turned around and gave him a death stare and said in a very nasty tone \"I will be RIGHT WITH YOU!\" And stormed off to the bar area where she continued to throw glances back at us.  My husband, being a server himself and generally understanding of busy restaurant situations, was very hurt by this blow up.  For a moment, we decided it would be worth trying to wait, but the longer we waited, even after another server came to greet us and said it would be a minute, eventually leaving became the better option.  Again, we had no issue waiting and fully expected to do so, but the rude outburst to a genuinely polite comment was absolutely uncalled for in our opinion.  We understand when people have bad days, we are human too, but there is no reason to take it out on anyone else--potential customer or otherwise.  We checked the other reviews prior to posting to see if this was an isolated incident which does not seem to be the case and it is very unfortunate.  We have no intention to return considering company culture.",
