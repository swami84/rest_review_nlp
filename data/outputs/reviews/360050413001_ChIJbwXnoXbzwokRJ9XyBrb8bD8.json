The chicken rolls are not too bad with a good amount of cheese and sauce.

Well I went to grab a slice yesterday Dec. 30, 2014 and I noticed the worker was outside under the street grate in the basement.  He came upstairs,  held the door open for me and proceeds to grab a slice and put it in the oven. He never washed his hands or even grabbed a glove.  Granted he did not put his hands on that slice but he did touch a pie he'd taken out of the oven. I was immediately digusted.  I mean New York is definitely not the cleanest city and after working in a basement outside in the street Im sure his hands were filthy. I asked him if they had a sink that he could wash his hands and he refused!  Actually refused to clean his hands while prepping and serving food! The nerve! Obviously upset I denied the food. In an effort to explain he says you'll never find a pizzeria cleaner than this. The remark made my stomach hurt. To justify trying to serve customers in that condition by comparing filth in other locations is just low . Being clean and food prep go hand in hand. Apparently these guys didn't get the memo.",
