After that, another 10+ mins later, we were told they ran out of white rice. So we did not touch that dish at all, as we could not, and at that point, we wasted 1+ hour on a working day and we all got super upset and decided to leave. Waiter has good attitude, but sesme he was too busy with other tables. My whole point is if you go there, and see only one waiter, and there are many other people sitting already, just leave, don't waste your time.",

I might pay 18% myself but it doesn't make you feel good when you are forced to do so.",
