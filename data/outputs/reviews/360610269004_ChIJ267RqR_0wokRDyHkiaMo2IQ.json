The manager ray helped me out big time! I\u2019m making sure I got my food. Him and his worker who I did not get her name, but she was so helpful over the phone. During hard times with the virus this was one of the few locals opened and even though my Uber service was trash he made sure I got my food in one piece. I really appreciate this place and people like this who help during tough times. My four year old is a picky eater and ate it all that\u2019s how I know the food is also great!",

What a horrible idea...  I got the worst mofongo I've ever eaten in my life. The chicharron was like a piece of rubber, it tasted like it had been there for a month and then they reheated it.  They served us some carne salada which tasted as if it had been marinated for a month. It tasted somewhat rancid but was edible.  I ordered a morir so\u00f1ando and the person who was making it took a sip for herself after she had served mine. I ordered to go. When I tasted it i noticed the orange juice had gone bad, like wine-like bad. I could only take one sip. She had tasted it and knew this and preferred not to say a thing and steal my 5 dollars.  All in all don't even bother coming at this place. This is a bar more than anything else and the food seems to be aimed at drunk people who can't taste how horrible the food served at this place is.
