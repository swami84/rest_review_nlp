I usually get a regular size bowl (I try to eat half and save the rest for later) but you could eat in all in one serving easily. Especially since it's so delicious, you won't want to stop eating! Today I got double veggie quinoa as my base, green beans and roasted brussel sprouts as my veg with double ancho pulled chicken. Topped off with sliced almonds and chipotle ranch dressing on the side. Perfect Friday lunch!",

The food was okay not the best. Especially the sweet potatoes were hard and really not good. I would not come here again with such horrible customer service.

They can pack a lot of people in there and so it\u2019s probably still a cool place to be when it\u2019s very busy. 2. The options. There are SO many options! Normally, my husband has a hard time adjusting to a new healthy food place if I take him (he\u2019s fairly picky) but even he smiled at some of the options available. Their drink options are plentiful as well. There is definitely something here for everyone.  Also, it looks as though they have a smoothie bar, which wasn\u2019t open, but sounds heavenly. 3.  The food was really yummy.  Even the rice had diverse flavor profiles without an excess of sodium and that is always a plus. The teriyaki chicken was juicy and not overpowering in flavor either. It was extremely well-balanced.  Even though I only had three items and a scoop of guacamole, I ate til I was satisfied and didn\u2019t feel too heavy nor was I let down in the flavor department at all! 4. They use cast-iron skillets to cook everything in!  So basically, there\u2019s your boost of iron right there. I was pleasantly surprised with this little tidbit.",

Truly the most friendly staff a wonderful atmosphere of beautiful space and truly delicious food! A hidden treasure in my opinion! Not that it's hidden as it's right on the corner downtown however as to me it is new I think that it will be quite the popular hotspot to dine for any meal downtown!",

I opted for the spicy feta - clearly on the menu - but was met with a confused look, as if the girl had no idea that was even offered. The food is delicious but if I truly were to build my perfect bowl, it would cost nearly $20. When it says two bases, two proteins, and two veggies for $10, that covers the bare minimum.",

This location opened up a couple days ago and I tried it out for the first time today and they did not disappoint. The staff were very helpful and attentive and were able to explain the menu. It\u2019s similar to Fresh Kitchen except you have more options and the food has more flavor. Not to mention the portion sizes and prices are unbeatable. They offer Poke bowls, acai bowls, and build your own hot bowls. I look forward to making this a regular place I go to get a healthy bite.",
