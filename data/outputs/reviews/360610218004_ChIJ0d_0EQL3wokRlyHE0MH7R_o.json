I live right by Sister's on 124th & Mad, and while I loveeeee Sister's this place is def going to creep as a close favorite because of price to portion.  The Mac was actually baked, the yams bomb, the chicken was cooked very well and not dry (yall some of these places be cooking their chicken to death).
