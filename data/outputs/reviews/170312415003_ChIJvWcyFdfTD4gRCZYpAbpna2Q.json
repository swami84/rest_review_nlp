The soy marinated soft boiled egg is nothing but exceptional with the soy marinade penetrating the yolk to which compliments the broth extremely well. Absolutely delicious!!! The hot karaage is covered in a buffalo style sauce which is spicy and will numb your mouth, I bid you caution if this is your first time trying something spicy. The lemonade is tart and comes with some pulps to which might indicate that it was freshly squeezed.",

Speed of services - it took almost 25 minutes for our orders to come to our table on a Thursday night (Pork Shoyu and Chicken Original) and one of the order came out wrong. Which took another 15 minutes for the correct order to came. The server was very kind and apologized on the wrongly order and provided us with an discount. We do appreciate her effort to make things right. 2. Noodle - for a ramen place, the noodle quality were subpar. First thing I noticed is the stickiness. My ramen noodle came in all crumbled together into a big ball. Lack of flavor and texture was also an issue, the noodles were extremely soft and bland. 3. Soup broth - bland. And to be fair, for a Shoyu ramen to taste bland is pretty ironic.",

Karaage were big pieces of fried chicken thighs (usually is) and they were very flavorful and juicy. The garlic mayo that comes with the chicken is amaazingg. I ordered the vegetarian ramen with thin noodles instead of thick. It comes with seasoned veggies such as cabbage, spinach, carrots, broccoli and corn! Also comes with fried tofu which was surprisingly flavorful as well. I added an egg and garlic oil as extra. Broth was delish just wish there was more of it!! Everyone's ramen was delicious, but they were all lacking broth. Black Sesame Icecream and Matcha Cheesecake were the cherry on top of an awesome meal. Overall great atmosphere!",

And being that Kinton is a new restaurant to the area, it was top of the search list which led me to looking at what it had to offer. Viewing its Yelp page, I was intrigued by its menu which resulted in me bookmarking it after finding out how close it was to my apartment. Hehe, and in order to build that urgency to visit soon rather than later or never I snapshotted some of the items on its menu as a reminder of the restaurant.  I visited this restaurant when the area was least congested because it sits in the heart of Wicker Park along Milwaukee Ave. Your options for parking within a short radius from the restaurant are either metered or neighborhood. I personally do not recommend counting on snagging that metered spot which sits right outside of the restaurant because there are plentiful businesses in the area with other customers that are eyeing it as well.  Kinton is a beautiful Japanese hub that is nicely set-up consisting of wooden seats & tables. It brings new energy as well as a diverse hand of employees that blend right in with a hipster neighborhood like Wicker Park. And with it being new to the area you get that feeling that your business is well-appreciated. I did enjoyed the employee-to-customer acknowledgment among customers entering and leaving the restaurant which is always a plus in my book.  I ordered the pork miso ramen after briefly debating between it and the vegetarian ramen which I vowed to the waitress I'd try on a different visit. Both, along with the karaage ramen were three items that initially built that interest in visiting Kinton in the first place. I cannot complain about the service I received! I felt welcome and my food came in a timely manner and was tasty. And with the way Kinton is designed, the waitress had good eyes on me in-between servicing other customers.  Kinton Ramen most definitely gets my recommendation. It is the fitting place whether it be for an open-bar drink, lunch or dinner with friends, family or an intimate date. And lastly, the alcoholic beverages are 50% off during happy hour.  ~Blessings all~  Thomas G",
