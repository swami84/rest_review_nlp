We both had shrimp korma per our request because that's not on the menu. I must say it taste more like curry rather than the sweet almond flavor that it should be. There were no raisins or almonds in the sauce but the was a marchiano cherry in it. The mango lassi was super thick although not sweet, I had to keep adding water in it to dilute it. I don't think I would be returning. I will stick to Pearl's on Franklin.",

This is one of the few places where you can get it and the garlic naan in particular is delicious.  I should also note that Nimbooda is BYOB with no corkage fee (and Prospect Heights Beer Works is literally one block away). The service is attentive and fast and they deliver.  Most importantly, the food is outstanding. There are dishes I usually don't even like that I love here (Chana Masala for example). My favorites (besides that) are: Eggplant Bhindi Bharta, Mushroom Curry, and the Saag. They are accomodating about removing dairy from vegetarian entrees that have it.  I highly recommend Nimbooda for anyone looking for Indian food in the area. As with most Indian restaurants, it's very reasonably priced as well. It's an excellent option for a large group dinner on a budget (inexpensive, delicious food and BYOB).",

Well, at least not between the Navy Yard and Prospect Expressway and between the East River and Brownsville.  The staff is wonderful, and the food surpasses anything in the area. So well spiced, and it all tastes far more fresh and delicious than the competition.  Thanks, Nimbooda, for coming to the neighborhood. Please stay longer than I do. :-D  EDIT: I did move! And Nimbooda is still goin strong and making AWESOME FOOD. I still come back to this neighborhood just to eat at Nimbooda because it's that much better than everywhere else.

It's a tiny place that's never busy inside, but then again few Indian restaurants ever are since most of the business comes from take-out/delivery.  Nimbooda's servers are incredibly hospitable and often bring out a little amuse bouche before the meal comes out (another perk to going in-person). I love the food. My favorites include the samosa chaat, chicken korma, and kandhari naan. If you have a sweet tooth and want a twist on your naan, get the kandhari naan! It's a little sweet and super buttery and SO GOOD.  BYOB. Winey Neighbor is just up the street. And if you forget to bring something beforehand, they're cool about you running out to grab a bottle.  Inside it's really cozy with an intimate vibe. I'll be back soon!",
