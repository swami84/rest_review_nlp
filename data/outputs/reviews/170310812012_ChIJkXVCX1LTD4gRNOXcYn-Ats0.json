We ordered 25$ worth of food for 2 people and she somehow managed to forget to give chips for the Sandwhich we ordered. I also noticed that the student behind us in line ordered the same sandwich as me and this student was given her sandwich before me. Please improve attitude, service and gratitude for our business.",
