You pick your seafood (shrimp, snow or king crab, mussels, etc), pick a side, pick your boil and then pick your spice.  Spice I highly recommend Anchors Away as it was just enough hotness you need that doesnt over power the food.  While we had our drinks, she gave us a sample of grits.  I am not a grit-guy but tried it anyway, but boy theirs was great!  As you see below, everything is served in a bag.  Expect it to be messy!!!  Normally I see it in a bucket or in a net, but I like this idea as it still marinates in the bag.  The food was awesome.  I had the shrimp and snow crabs.  Now it is my favorite seafood place.  No parking in front of place but there is other street parking and a huge parking garage on the east side.  Fat Tuesday is coming up so that will be fun to enjoy.",

I arrive with my boyfriend and was told we had to wait for a table and that we would have the next table... coo, so we wait about 15 minutes and then our waitress sat us at a table. As soon as our waitress walked away, we were getting yelled at by a worker at the bar(turns out she was the manager), being told that we can\u2019t sit there that\u2019s someone else\u2019s spot. We were confused o it waitress had just sat us there.... After being told to get up we were told there were still 2 more people in front of us.... 2.) We finally get seated at the table and order our meals, I ordered the Valentine\u2019s Day special. My food came about 7 minutes after my boyfriends, and the first thing I noticed was a long nasty hair in my garlic potatoes, I instantly had it sent back for new potatoes... (the manager got me new potatoes) 3) After the new potatoes came out about 2 minutes later, I went to bite into my asparagus and it was literally cold! Not even luke warm, just cold! As if it were sitting under a fan. So I check my shrimp.. THATS COLD TOO. 4)I just asked for a shrimp boil at that point (my boyfriend\u2019s was nice and hot) and it came out about 20 minutes later... keep in mind my boyfriend\u2019s food was fine, so he was nearly done eating when I was just getting my food. 5) I asked for some sort of compensation when It was time to get my bill. The manager really had the nerve to ask my waitress why. So I give my waitress the run down, she goes to tell her manager, and we get 6 dollars off... that\u2019s it! There was poor customer service, hair in my food, I had to re-order due to my food being cold, plus some... there was even more issues but I won\u2019t go into great detail about those .... long story short I will never eat there again and I am appalled at the service that was given tonight! This is absolutely ridiculous! \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude24",

        "caption": "I am not a fan of seafood but everyone I was with was. They raved about the food. They got mainly what they were looking forward to. I ordered chicken Alfredo pasta. Unfortunately they were out of the chicken for the pasta. I got the Alfredo pasta without the chicken. When I got it i was very disappointed that it had grape or cherry tomatoes in it. I did not mind the spinach in it but the tomatoes changed the flavor of the sauce. I ate it, it was good but not what i was expecting.  I wish they had a few more non seafood choices that were not blackened, Cajun or highly seasoned. I have a problem with highly spiced food. We had a lot of fun, they enjoyed their seafood very much. The lemon shakeup with choices of added flavoring was wonderful. I chose the peach and it was delicious. The cornbread tasted more like cake than cornbread, it was good but was not what i was expecting either. My better half, ordered oysters, he said they were great. The only dissapointing thing with his oysters was they did not have horseradish to put on them. He also ordered the shrimp boil I think is what it was called. He asked for a medium spice to it. He got shrimp that was way spicier than he likes. He couldn't even eat them. Luckily he had filled up on the 15 or so oysters he ate. Which was his reason for choosing this particular restaurant in the first place. He was hungry for oysters in the half shell. If we are ever in the area visiting family again we would probably return. I loved the atmosphere it was like a family reunion in a bar kind of a place. We had a lot of fun and we even closed the place down. My only hope is if we return they have a few non seafood choices that would satisfy me a bit better and that they would explain the levels of heat on the shrimp a bit better so it would get eaten and not go to waste. Overall it was a fun place to go.",

Another dinner party member had the gumbo. The other diner had a steak. The last guest had the crab bag.  This last visit was a 180\u00b0 turn. We invited local friends and a couple from Chicago to dine with us. The food came out in time. Four guests had the boil bag of various items. They were not happy. The butter sauces were made of oil...disappointing. the steak was not satisfying and my shrimp and grits was awful. The party member who had the fish tacos said that they were good.

My wife didn't even finish her food but wouldn't allow me to say anything. Based on tonight's meal and the generic frozen veggies she was served, the overly salted salmon when she asked for it plain with no seasonings at all I doubt we return. I no longer recommend this place as it's obviously changed. And as a side note there were only 4 tables so no way we should have had any food issues. You have to earn a 5 star and this place did it. The service was great. The food was fantastic. Totally enjoyed this evening's dinner. They will be seeing a lot more of me there. So much to try. Check out their menu online.",

I ordered the salmon, and it was overcooked, as well as the vegetables. The rice, I couldn\u2019t even eat. Everything was too salty. I thought it be fun to order the appetizer, gator bites. That too was overcooked and not worth $11 for a handful of tough nuggets.  The kitchen staff started opening up the bleach, as there were only a few of us in the restaurant, and it made the experience even worse. I was very disappointed, and it was one of the most unsatisfying culinary experiences I\u2019ve had in a long time.",

We walk in to a very unique interior restaurant for downtown Springfield. We decided to sit at the bar with one other person already seated. Upon sitting down the bartender was consumed making other drinks and did not speak to us. You could tell it was one of her very first days and she was consumed with one customer and measuring everything to spec. Finally another waitress spoke to us and handed us menus. She says bartender will be with you shortly. I ordered a 7/7 and they dont have it so I ask for crown and coke and again it was poured to spec if not a little short. And the coke was flat. My better half orders a cabernet and we are asked if we want red or white????? Its cabernet...soooo...  anyways we get the wine it is there house red and it has gone bad and taste like vinegar!  So we asked if it can be replaced and they asked us to drink zinfandel instead. Really?? So she drinks water. Then we order shrimp cocktail and wait 10 min to get it and when it comes it is hot not cold like shrimp cocktail should be served. We go to settle up because we are fed up at this point. They try charge us for the wine that has gone bad and then my crown and coke short glass was $9!!!! $20 later we will never go back. Simply too bad it is ran like this, it has potential. However, they did nothing to change our minds or make it better.",

Basically the food left plenty to be desired and it probably had to do with the waiting and cooking staff having a grand old time cussing and shouting in the back room. Don't waste your money or time. It seems like a quick failure unless they can turn it around. PS the etouffe was so bad I never made it past the first bite.",

We ordered one of the lobster tail \"bag\" dinners, fried oysters and the ettoffee. Our friends lobster tail was delivered without a plate and we had to request that, and napkins and silverware. The ettoffee was requested to be spiced at the second highest level of heat and came out as bland, orange and in a bowl that would normally be a lunch serving size(small.) My wife ordered the oysters, which were tasty but asked for garlic fries which actually arrived as something tasting completely different, and not very good. The prices were what you would pay at an Olive Garden or Red Lobster(lunch) but not nearly as good. Also, the restrooms were out of paper towels and toilet paper and they were having a problem with their soda fountain which was apparently caused by bad syrup or crossed lines from the tanks because the diet soda kept coming out tasting like cherry. If you sail into Anchors Aweigh, you will wish you had cut your line and had not gone ashore.....",
