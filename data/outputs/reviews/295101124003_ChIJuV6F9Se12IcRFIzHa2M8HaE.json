I saw a dish labeled as vegan(It had the green v next to it) yet when I read the ingredients it included eggs. I disregarded it and ordered the tofu fried rice instead since it was labeled as vegan and egg was not on the ingredients. Yet, when it arrived it had egg. I've since gone to the website and I noticed it is not mislabeled online, but in the physical menu it is. I would recommend updating this.",

I feel like if you\u2019re craving authentic Vietnamese cuisines, Mai Lee or Pho Grand are your best options!  When I made my order today, I was kind of shocked when the waitress asked me to spell the name of the dish that I wanted. Midway into spelling it, she cut me off to ask for the English name of the dish instead. Since it wasn\u2019t on the online menu, I literally had to describe the dish to her, as well as my friend and cousin with their orders. I just thought that was super unprofessional, and time consuming.  Anyways, I ended up ordering Pho tac biet, and let me just say it barely had any flavor, even after I added the hoisin/Siracha sauce. I only took 5-6 bites and decided I was DONE. The broth legit tastes as if it was made from hot dog water. My cousin on the other hand, ordered Bo Kho that came out with rice mixed in. Rice??? Not going to lie, that caught us all off guard, because it\u2019s usually served with Vietnamese baguettes. When we asked about that, they said they didn\u2019t serve it with bread... like how disappointing is that? That\u2019s like eating cereal with no milk. The cafe su da also had such an odd consistency, that made my throat itch. And not too long after we left, both my friend and I started having some abdominal pain... we most likely won\u2019t be coming back again.  On the flip side, I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was really nice, and so were the workers.",

There is plenty of seating: on the patio, inside but with the windows open, at the bar, or completely inside. The bar serves delicious house cocktails and a variety of wine and beer. I tried the Saigon Slinger, it was strong and sweet, and I would get it again for sure.  The food was also amazing! I tried the Cai Xao Dao Hu, which was stir fried veggies and fried tofu served in a sauce (although I\u2019m not sure what type) and I had it with brown rice. I cleaned the whole plate. The tofu was cooked perfectly! My uncle tried the chicken satay and pineapple fried rice which he loved. My aunt tried the dish with the ginger rice cooked in a clay pot. I tried a bite of hers and it was very light and refreshing with the ginger.  Small touches that I appreciated were the fresh flowers on the table and the lit candles. It made dinner feel very classy. We also had a very nice waiter, although I never got his name.  I would absolutely recommend eating here! The price is to be expected with the location and service they provide.",

Now average over 15 dollars for a vietnamese dish; it is very pricy comparing to other places. I ordered the fried rice. The chicken was not fresh at all, looked like plastic, tasted weird. The rice itself was very tough, like just heated after taking out from the freezer. All the vegetables in the dish taste just like those have been frozen for a long time. Why do they still exist? Unfortunately, Little Saigon is the only vietnamese restaurant around CWE. Please, someone open a new and better one soon. I like vietnamese, but I can't tolerate the food quality in this restaurant.",

I don't necessarily mean it has a fan base that rivals the Cards, but I mean it has almost everything you could want from an eating establishment, leaving little to be desired.  Delicious food, great service, decent prices, and an excellent sidewalk setup make Little Saigon a great way to experience Vietnamese food and the Central West End.",
