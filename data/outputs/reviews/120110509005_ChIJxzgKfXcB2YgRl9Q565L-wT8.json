So, I called and spoke with a man who said he'd take us off of the fax list... that was a week ago and we continued to receive them. So just now, I called and spoke with a woman who claimed to be the manager. Not only did she argue with me and accuse me of lying, saying I never called... But was extremely rude and then hung up on me. I don't see any of these things working for business especially when it comes to serving your customers and community. I wouldn't go to a place that treat people the way she treated me. On top of this, the owner just called asking me to take down this review stating I did not call his store (in which I did)... continued by threats saying \"reviews work both ways.\" He said he was a patient but refused to give me his name so I could address him. In my opinion, this is outrageous behavior and am very offended for the lack of respect I just received. Maybe instead of threatening me you could reprimand your employee.",

I had no idea what the discount was, I was simply asking if you had any specials, and he said let me check with a manager. You could have simply said \"no sorry, we don't have any specials\"... but to go on a rampage of \" I would rather lose the order than lose money, simply shows that you should not be a manager and should never be in contact with the customers, you just lost this office and all of our other 3 locations!",

The customer service was great, while the delivery guy at the time was a more significant steak holder of the restaurant, he was really nice, prompt and  displayed a genuine appreciation for my business.  My second experience was a bit different. But not alarming. I ordered the 1/2 pound burger without many expectations as this is an Italian style restaurant. Once it arrived over an hour later I was surprised to see that it maintained a some type of warmth as opposed to it be cold. I was a bit disappointed but my violent hunger would allow me to return the food.  After opening it and consuming the first bite I realized that this could have been a really tasty burger had I only visited the venue in person.  overall the wait time for a semi warm burger and fries was not worth the price tag. I would suggest this restaurant to others, but I'd be weary of the delivery wait time for smaller orders.",

The chicken just tasted like butter...and loads of it! Decided to go for the bread and it was drenched in butter...as I tried to pull off a piece, butter started gushing down my arm...disgusting!!! So after I was turned off from the meal completely...I decided to just eat the cheesecake and call it a day. I went to take a bite of the cheesecake and it was frozen...a total lose...lose! I called to let the store know about my experience and they offered nothing except for a smart a** comment that the pasta is made with butter. Thanks for pointing out the obvious! I will never order from them again...this is the second chance I gave them...I am 20+ years in the hospitality business and am not impressed at all with the way they handled the situation!",

I ordered a pizza (with beef) last night and it was also delicious -- these guys are friendly and the orders arrived within 30 minutes.
