Then once they were finished, she closed the window in my face. Then she put on the radio super load. Then when I looked in window a minute late, she was sorting containers of dip. I got mad and left, and called the manager right after. He proceeded to laugh and say she didn't see me. I was about to drop at least $70 of my hard earned money. I guarantee I can find somewhere that will take my money with a smile. I have been wanting to try it for so long, and if it was good I would have been there at least a week spending at least $70. That's at least $280 a month. I could have been paying there electricity, lights and phone lmao. It's all good tho \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
