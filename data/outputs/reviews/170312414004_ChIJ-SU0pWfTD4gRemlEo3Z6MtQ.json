There was an employee (short, Latinx) walking around with no mask on, and another staff (taller/black) man walking around with his nose sticking out of his mask handling food without gloves. The Latinx chick seemed to be done with her shift but man, watching her walk between the back, the kitchen, AND answering a patron\u2019s question without her mask gave me goosebumps. Wait times for carry out orders are kind of absurd in the evenings as they don\u2019t seem to yet have a fluid system for carry out orders made via online/phone call. Beautiful outdoor seating area, bar is awesome and generally the staff is pretty nice. Sandwiches have been on point 100% of the time. Writing this review as I wait for my gf waiting for her sandwich. It\u2019s been 13 minutes of her waiting inside and we placed the order 15 minutes ago.",

The service was exceptional and each staff member including the owner made us feel special. They were super busy being a new hot spot especially for quick and efficient takeout service. We ended up sitting at the bar for about 3 hours and had some snacks, apps, and tasted drinks, then ordered dinner to go for later and I just finished it and I am now obsessed. We will be back time and time again and wish them and their friendly staff all the success in the world. Derek needed a special birthday and you delivered.  p.s. try any of their signature drinks or local drafts! great variety!",

We've driven to Madison, Wisconsin for the subs (thats how good they are). I love all of the Cheba Huts, but being that I'm from Chicago, our mural is definitely my favorite. The atmosphere is dope too! From the food and drinks to the vibes- trust me, you have to check this place out!",
