But they are disorganized, food took an inordinate amount of time, and then it was cold when it got to us (so it had clearly been sitting around for 30 minutes, despite my asking for it several times). I personally did not love the taste, but it is supposedly a different style and others may like it better. Still, the lack of coordination of the kitchen and wait for food that is then cold, points to lack of leadership and standards by management. Reminds me of Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsey -- and every episode with these sorts of issues also has storage room full of rotten meat and moldy vegtables.  The restaurant is completely empty, and they blame it on covid. But every other restaurant in Miami is packed. They may want to consider, there is probably a reason beyond covid that they are empty and others aren't.  This restaurant needs management to step up and start leading. My message to them: Watch Kitchen Nightmares and take notes. You have many of the same problems.",

We were greeted from the first moment by Jenny the owner of the place who was very kind who had a lot of patience to explain each dish that we did not know. In addition, the restaurant was super convenient located near the Marriott hotel in Biscayne blvd where we stayed and the open Chinese kitchen made our meeting a real evening, it gave us confidence and security since we could see the dishes as they were cooked for us and everything at the moment. We ordered the Pork Chop from this place it is delicious, a portion of orange duck and sauteed seafood ! Incredible experience, I recommend it a thousand times!",

Fish was fresh and they used high quality seaweed . As you finish an individual hand roll, chef will make new one. They don't make your whole order at once. This keeps the seaweed crispy which makes all the difference ! I ordered the set with bay scallop, salmon, crab. Also, toro hand roll. The only hand roll that I disliked was the scallop hand roll because they mixed it with mayo. I felt the mayo overpowered the scallop. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends !",

The shrimp and vegetable spring rolls were divine.  We had multiple entrees and ate every bite.  And, we had two sushi rolls that even the kids enjoyed.  Even more importantly, the service made the experience.  Our waitress interacted with all of us, including our youngest child, and the food was brought to our table quickly and hot!  Do not hesitate, go and enjoy!  Highly recommended, from all 5 adults and the 2 kiddos.",

They do not offer the lunch menu unless you specifically ask for it! So shady!  And when you do ask for the lunch menu, they act like they weren\u2019t thinking and gave you the wrong one. Every customer around me had the same experience (I asked, they all felt scammed). I can\u2019t believe this is how they do business. Trying to trick tourists and locals like that. They should be ashamed of themselves.  As for the food, it was terrible. Meat was chewy, soup was bland, rice was mushy. The chicken was especially odd. It must\u2019ve been old. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any passion in that kitchen. I think they\u2019ve all given up. I guess they only care about ripping off hotel guests.  And for the service, it was awful. The server was so rude, she obviously didn\u2019t want to be there. She rolled her eyes when I asked for the menu, rolled her eyes when I ordered, and rolled her eyes when I asked for anything during my lunch. Maybe she should change careers.  All in all, I feel disrespected. I have never experienced such shadiness at a restaurant. Unethical and unprofessional. This was my first and last time at Tony Chan\u2019s Water Club.  AVOID THIS SCAM RESTAURANT AT ALL COSTS!!!",

As a good chef, I love knowing that the food I eat in a restaurant is fresh and I can certify that in Tony Chan's Water Club. We are frequent clients because we enjoy the ambience, its perfect for a family reunion and we can actually have beautiful conversations in their big and comfortable round tables. Speaking about the food, they have a fresh sushi bar at the front where we always have the veggie and salmon roll. As main we enjoy their peking duck, haven't tried something so delicious anywhere else. During the week, we went a couple times with my husband to try their lunch special which was perfect for a break from our work routine. They deserve 5 stars!! Excellent service and extraordinary food quality, thank you!! Lila and Alex",

Me and my mother spent most of the day across the street at the passport agency, reviews seemed good so we pick this out instead of the other small places in the Double tree Hilton. The seats we basically outdoor patio chairs but everything else looked upscale including the view of the docks and boats. We sat right next to the huge glass wall looking into the kitchen, after we placed an order we saw one staff member grab an open bowl of dried ramen type noodles and threw them on a table. Then we see another staff come out and throw the noodles and grabs a container of raw chicken off the table, no lid, and throw that into the wok. The kitchen looked really clean but all the open containers of food was discerning. When we received our food, I honestly didn\u2019t know how to feel. I\u2019ve never been disappointed to look at a bowl of pasta before. We had ordered the chicken lo mein, it was pale noodles that literally looked like instant ramen, pale chicken, a few small whole mushroom and a couple green slivers of bell pepper on top. We were so hungry and still on a time crunch to get back to the passport we dug in anyways, more disappointment. It tasted as bland as it looked. As I go to use the soy sauce container to drown my bland noodles, I see a thick lougey type brown thing on the bottle. The bottle wasn\u2019t clear like normal soy sauce so I couldn\u2019t see in the container, so I dumped the bottle on an empty plate and it was lumpy. On top of all this our meal cost us 42 dollars. If you think this visit couldn\u2019t have gotten worse, we asked for sweet tea, our server brought us two glasses of brisk in a cup. Brisk is alright but if you don\u2019t know your getting it, it\u2019s an assault on your taste buds when your mouth really wanted that sweet southern golden nectar. That should be a crime. Just don\u2019t go here. Choose another restaurant so you don\u2019t have to waste your time and you can live without the disappointment that we now will forever have.",

A few days later, when we were going over our bills, we realized they also deducted 40% as tip instead of the typical 20 to 25%.  When I go to a restaurant, I expect cashiers and waitresses to be competent and honest while carrying out simple calculations, and don't want to worry about overpaying by a large amount.

If you come to this restaurant ordering General Tso's chicken and then complain about the price, I think this is stupidity at its best. You should ONLY order such a boring dish at a takeout, NOT at this place.  Here is a good Cantonese restaurant that I have eaten, a better one on the East Coast. We ordered hot plate beef, eight treasures duck, eight treasures tofu, all with the authentic Cantonese wok flavor that we craved. Heard the chef is from Hong Kong and has over 20+ years of experience  Good food, highly recommended. Avoid the boring American Chinese dishes, and you won't be disappointed",

There is another Chinese place around that delivers but they have the same ridiculous pricing scheme.
