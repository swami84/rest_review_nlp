I live 4 blocks away & nearly two hours had gone by with no word on my food. I made 4 separate calls to check on the status of my food just to have the employee call his delivery guy to tell me \"5 more minutes\". What's worse is they didn't know how to refund me the money I just spent with my debit card so I had to physically walk there just to get my cash. The guy was incredibly rude to me while I was there & passive aggressively told me to have a \"good night\". Trash service & trash food. Avoid this place like the plague.",
