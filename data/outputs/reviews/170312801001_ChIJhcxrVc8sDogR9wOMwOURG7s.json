I spotted Subway and immediately started thinking about a Cold Cut Trio sandwich off of their menu. However, there was still the issue of needing to use the bathroom so I decided to make my way there first. As soon as I walked in and motioned toward the bathroom, the owners (I assume they were the owners) possibly a husband and wife or just business partners stopped me and said customers can only use the bathroom. I said, no problem, I\u2019m getting ready to order but I\u2019ve been holding off the bathroom for a while and needed to use it. They stated I needed to buy first and then I could use it. That was very unreasonable and terrible customer service. I passed a Starbucks and a cafe on the way there. If I wanted to just use the bathroom, I would have went to those places. Anyways, I stated that I was a customer and preparing to order but they still said I need to buy first! After that harassment and judgement, I decided that I did not want to patronize that establishment anymore and left. I never got a chance to try out their food because the experience with them was socially unacceptable! There were other ways to handle that situation than telling me to buy first then use the bathroom. They could have simply asked me what my intentions were. I would never take the chance of losing a customer just because I assumed he/she are there only to use the bathroom. I would have asked first. Anyways, terrible terrible customer service. I don\u2019t recommend this place at all!",

Usually, Subway service varies from \u2018ok\u2019 to exceptional, with this place the first exception. Pretty much every negative comment here covered my experience.  Right off the bat I felt like the prices seemed slightly higher than other Subways I\u2019ve been to even though there is a sign that reads \u201cNew lower prices\u201d, or something along those lines. Whatever, what\u2019s a few cents, anyway?  Things didn\u2019t get bad until the sandwich started being made. I look over and see that the veggies don\u2019t look that fresh, but that too, I brush off.  I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese and it seemed like that\u2019s all she wanted me to have. Every time I ordered an ingredient, she would throw in a pinch of it and then ask if that\u2019s it. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It was clear she is conditioned, either by her own stingy desires, or by upper management, to try and stop the customers from putting more ingredients, thus reducing the need to resupply. I had to ask for more about 3 times per ingredient to get close to the standard amount I\u2019ve seen them put before.  Then, I know when they put bacon, they always put 4 pieces. I look over and saw that someone previously took it upon themselves to split the bacon pieces into halves or thirds. I basically got like 1 1/2 pieces of bacon for a foot long. When I got my sandwich, I was all smooshed and not appetizing at all.  I think she also asked like 3 times if I wanted a meal or cookies even though I kept saying no. Nice lady, but horrible experience. Cheaping out might save you a couple bucks, but it makes you lose customers. Never coming back to this Subway again.",

They are out of tea, the point system on the subway card cannot be added and they say our card is not active.. been using this card for 2 months and never had an issue also they recognize there are points on it but don't want to add.  Lastly the lady is using the same gloves for everyone and never tosses them out for all the people after us. But in the back she is cutting  vegetables bare hands no gloves.. . While making the sandwich every Ingredient is followed by what else what else , is that it? What else.. ..  doesn't want to give us the free drink coupon we had and also wanted to chargecfor the veggie delight 6.99 where everywhere else its 5 dollars.. claims its downtown location thats why! By far the worst subway ever. Sorry for typos. Trying g to type fast dumping info to keep you away from this terrible spot.",
