It also hits the neighborhood\u2019s spot too. This fairly priced on-the-go Mediterranean food is needed around here.  Sometimes I would rather have a pita pocket but that can also create a mess. Having the falafel wrap tight and crispy makes it easy to eat on the fly and with no food crumbs wasted. The wrap overall is well built and super tasty. I enjoyed the few simple ingredients to make the full flavor more dynamic and the two added options on the side are awesome. The one side sauce is very spicy and very delicious. You\u2019ve been warned.  I\u2019ll be coming back to try other dishes...and maybe I\u2019ll try eating at home too:) Go support. Keep this place busy and functioning. Cheers!",
