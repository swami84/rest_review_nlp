As for service, they were all very lovely, but I asked for my bill and it took about 20min (plus a reminder) to actually get it and pay.

They had a great brunch menu at reasonable prices and was craving a Bloody Mary which they also had. French Bistro, feel and charm, the owner and his little Daughter were on hand to great us and seat us. Server was a charming and friendly young lady. Ordered and received our food in a timely matter. The Bloody Mary was fantastic and not watered down, the Eggs Benedict with Salmon was just right, the egg oozing out with a light cut through it and the Hollandaise Sauce was smooth and not too thick. Came with three Steak Fries with it's own spiced sauce which was an perfect accompaniment and amount. Also had the Croquet on Toast with an egg on top and mixed greens. The toast was a burned on the bottom, but it was still a tasty dish and didn't want to be too picky as we were hungry.  Only thing I'd have wished for was to be checked on a bit more for a refill of the drinks (only had one drink each) as we were never asked if we wanted any more to drink (empty glasses). But I guess it was luckily a good thing to pass on as we were satisfied with the meal overall and plan on going back for their Sunday $1 Oysters...",

We went for a brunch most recently. I had a simple steak and eggs, which was well seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. My bloody Mary was appropriately spicy and strong enough to notice. My partner's croque madame was on a generous portion of sourdough and done perfectly without any unnecessary flourishes.  The only downside to our meal was the noise. The dining room is very small and one very loud table can dominate the space with noise. That was unfortunately the case on our last visit, but not the fault of the restaurant so much as the fault of the table of primary a school teachers who struggled with using their \"inside voices\".",
