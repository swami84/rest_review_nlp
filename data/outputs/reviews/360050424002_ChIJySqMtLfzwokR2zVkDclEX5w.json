        "caption": "The food is sensational; however, the service is extremely slow (This may be an understatement. Consider the movement of a sloth). It was sad and painful watching the woman place the food in the small, clamshell container; for the customers before me. Though she wasn't old, it seemed as if her motor skills were greatly challenged.  Also, they are a bit pricey. Ordering a large oxtail meal, with cabbage and Mac and cheese cost me $22.50. There are no menus in sight, to gauge your cost before ordering!
