One of the male cooks was yelling at the other cook because the wrong order was given to someone else and our order took over 20 minutes. We ordered 2 cubans over $9 each  a deviled crab and stuffed potato that were over $6 each. The potato was a joke and the crab was full of shells and we had to throw it away..

I would like  to note that the lady that waited on me was crazy patient. The strawberry cake was outstanding, the cream horns and turn overs were really good. The cinnamon rolls and pineapple upside down muffins not so much., very dry/stale tasting, but I want to speak on the hot food side. In addition to the pastries we spent $48 on sandwiches. I will never spend money on that part again, if I ever come back. I explained to the nice gentleman that took our order that I have never been here before. Those two rude ladies. I asked for fries when I ordered my sandwich, Also requested lettuce tomato and onion  on my Cuban and it was put on the hamburger. When I asked about the fries with my Italian sand. She said you were supposed to ask for fries when you order. I said I did. And in return, she turns to the other lady and says what is she talking about. The other lady responds I don\u2019t know so they walk away. Really? I just spent $100 in y\u2019all business. Did she think I was just trying to get free fries or something?  If tge gentleman didn\u2019t hear me then charge me and make them, such disregard will have me spend my money somewhere else. Just a bit of advice; your business either prospers or go down the tubes depending upon whom you have as a spokesperson for your business. Whether it\u2019s a rude cashier or cook.  Or a nice, inviting person at your counter. First impressions are important. This is a really nice place, but sad to say I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back.",

I ordered a custom cake and received an image back from their personnel of the exact image I'd like on the cake. The color in the image that both parties (Alessi's and myself) was gold, yet when I picked up the cake the image on the cake was purple. How no one realized this I don't know. Or if someone did realize it they didn't have the courtesy to call or tell me before I looked at the cake when I picked up the cake for the event. They did say give us 10 minutes to try and fix it in which they put gold spray dust over the purple.  I specifically ordered this custom cake from Alessi's because I know their bakery items to be so yummy and typically the staff is very courtesy and helpful. This might have been a slip up but the fact they tried to just let it slide without saying anything is very frustrating and disappointing.",

Man, you literally just sit back and enjoy the freshness. No matter what time of day you step in Alessi you are La\u2019Familia.. There\u2019s no I in team but there\u2019s definitely one person that stands out, his name is Benny.. On numerous occasions, well more then I can count Benny has showed love countless times to less fortunate families around Hillsborough country by donating food.. At the end of the day he makes his rounds with the fresh food they made that morning that didn\u2019t sell and gives it out. Truth is it\u2019s all superheroes don\u2019t need caps and attention but this dude dose. He deserves all the praise in the world. I can keep writing on and on about Alessi Bakery but I swear you\u2019d have to swing in one day and try them out.  S/O to everyone that puts in time, passion and love to bring Tampa great Eats..!!!",

The staff was very friendly and I have no complaints! Reading some of these other reviews made me sad that people are so judgmental.

And the guava pastry was also delicious! They are doing some good things and the food also looked good too but as for the Italian cookies I was highly disappointed especially at the price I paid All in all alessi has some good things I don't want to say the place is terrible at all but the Italian cookies really need some work if you're expecting authentic Italian cookies I would pass but if you're looking for a unique bakery with a large selection this is the place you are looking for",

They provided me with great smiles and willing answer any questions I might have had. With the minor rush, they were able to get through the rush actual quickly.  Food: The food is the one thing that will bring you in every time. With my current visit, I had Cuban sandwich and devil crab. They both were delicious and while waiting, I was able sample some of their great pastries. This is one thing that I never forget as a child that always brought me back. They had some of your old favorites and some new selections as well.  Overall: The only reason I am giving them 3 stars because the overall improvements of the store. This bakery has been around for years and I feel they have not taken the pride in remolding the store and providing needed improvements with keeping the tradition of the store. I\u2019ve noticed they remodel since being a child, but I know this store (company) could do better.

Now, 20 years later, we are  ack in Florida for vacation and decided to share it with our kids. The food is still incredible, but the service was sorely lacking. We got there at 5:30 two times this week and tried to order from the grill. The lady reluctantly cooked our food both times but told us that they close at 6pm and that she wasn't supposed to still be running grill orders and she told us they were out of everything from being busy. Both times. Then, a girl at the bakery counter was frustrated that people kept coming in because \"it's Friday and we are ready to go home but people KEEP coming in for cookies.\" Her nametag said she was in training so she may just not know how things are done and I'm sure it was a rough day, but the Alessi's that I remember had a joy and friendliness about it that I was hoping to share with my kids. I will definitely be back for the food, and with lower expectations.  There were two people there that were awesome. A guy who was super fast at filling bakery orders, and a super friendly girl that helped in areas all over but I didn't catch her name. Hopefully they can train the others.  ***edited to add...my daughter is now throwing up from the Cuban mini sliders that had been in the cooler for a couple of days.",

The gentleman with the moustache will go above and beyond to make you what you're looking for, even if it's not exactly on the menu. They get a little backed up sometimes but be patient. Over in the sweets, the girls are pleasant as can be, and the goodies are amazing. I recommend the creme brulee bread pudding, the apple cake, and the cream horns.

I got an Oreo cupcake, lemon bar, and a slice of white chocolate strawberry cake.  The cupcake's frosting didn't taste like much (kind of like cool whip) but the cake was flavorful. For $2.75, it is fairly priced as it is a bit smaller than the average cupcake. The lemon bar had a nice after tang to it. Definitely different than your average lemon bar. Loved the strawberry cake. It wasn't too sweet and reminded me of Asian pastry.",

Nothing spectacular, but it doesn't meet up with the quality of other restaurants as well.  Odd gripe: the entire time eating there, there's an audio clip that is played over the whole building speakers thanking you for visiting the restaurant. Every time we'd be in the middle of a conversation, we'd have to stop talking until the droning audio clip would finish. This occurred seemingly every 10-15 minutes.  Edit since i cannot reply:  Sorry for the loss, however every 10 minutes is a bit much, and the volume is way high. I get that you want to thank your customers for visiting your shop, but it's the kind of thing that makes me not want to spend time there or money. Quickly went from \"hey this is great, it's close to the office and I should visit more often\" to \"yeah nevermind, I can't even enjoy being here, we'll go somewhere else.\"",

They have many ready-made cakes and treats available in the cases, and take specialty orders as well.  If you want savory to go with your sweets, check out the sandwich counter for breakfast and lunch options made fresh for you.  Absolutely worth the visit.  Enjoy!",

I give 3 stars because I know this was a great place at one time. The past two experiences where ruff. Seems like each time I go there it's a new associate. This could be the reason for the consistency. If you are in the area I would suggest other sandwich locations my rating is not on the bakery. There are to many restaurants in 4 block radius to be taken advantage of by this one. Sorry Alessi but this was the last time. Please take pride in what you do and hire associate's that do the same. I would have taken a picture of my sandwich but no reason for the embarrassment. I hope you fix it soon and recover from this. I ultimately hope the best.",

The top of my cake was lopsided on delivery. We were told there was nothing they could do without spoiling the looks further trying to fix it. Then the top fell off midway through the reception. Luckily, there were people nearby who saw it sliding off and caught it and sort of shoved it back up. My wedding photos have a lopsided, tilting cake in it. After I returned from my honeymoon, I called them and told them of the fiasco. They offered a partial refund ($300) once I dropped off the cake fountain. I dropped it off, but no one was at the bakery, so I asked if I could drop it off at the deli counter. I was told yes, and I did so. I put my name and contact information on a piece of paper on the inside of the bag containing the fountain. When I still had not received my refund of $300 plus the $25 deposit on the fountain after a couple of weeks, I called them. They said they never received the fountain and that would issue a check after they received it. I told them I had dropped it off at the deli counter and described the person who took it. They said they would check and call back. A week later, I still hadn't heard back so I called them. They said they checked, but never got the fountain and refused to send any money back. I finally said, just take the $25 out of the $300 you owe me. They said they would check into it. After waiting and waiting again, I called back and they said they didn't know what I was talking about regarding a refund. I finally gave up. I do NOT recommend this place due to honesty issues with their staff.",

When I came the guava and cheese turnovers had just come out fresh and thank goodness for BOGO because I couldn't stop at one. The first bite of that guava and cheese turnover was absolute heaven. Definitely the best thing I bought there. The pastry was light and crunchy, and the guava jam filling was delightfully sweet with the mild cheese flavor to balance it all out. I've had quite a bit of guava and cheese pastries by now and Alessi's is my favorite so far.  I also bought 4 of the cookies: a chocolate filled one, apricot jam filled, fig jam filled, and a traditional Italian wedding cookie. Favorite was the fig filled, but the rest of them were by no means bad.  I also got a mini eclair, mini cannoli, carrot cake pop, rainbow cookie, and a 9-inch carved Cuban. The Cuban was definitely delicious, not the best, but really good. Carrot cake pop was good, but the chocolate/frosting the cake was dipped in was a bit too thick and sweet for my tastes. The mini eclair and cannoli were both great- but if I came back, I would definitely get the cannoli again. The rainbow cookie was my least favorite from everything I bought, but it was still very tasty and I don't regret giving it a taste.  Overall, a great time and would definitely like to come again!",

When I got in line to order a sandwich, there was a little line. As I stood there for quite sometime for my turn to order, it looks as if the have a super slow process in completing orders. You place your order, and then the 3 girls make it, sell it and then take the next order. After finally ordering,the girl informed me that they will bring the order to me if I leave my number on the table since I was staying to eat there.  I went to the bakery side to get a few things. Yet again, not one person greeted me or informed me they would be with me in a moment. Out of the 6 girls behind the counter, only one person was actually attending to guests. 3 of the girls were having a personal conversation in the corner. One of them was actually crying, right in full view of the customers. After waiting 15 minutes, the one woman actually working finally addressed me. I was able to order my bakery items and while I was waiting for her to box them, the deli employee came over to give me my sandwich. I was completely floored how bad their customer service is. They completely ignore the customers coming in. I was there about 11:30 am so not sure why we were ignored. There was another woman who came in and was standing next to me who waited even longer for anyone to help her. Great food, great bakery items but not worth the wait or the ignorance of the staff. Focus on customer service!!!!! Customers should be greeted immediately even if you can\u2019t help them right away. At least greet them and let them you know will be with them shortly. That gives us the understanding you know we are standing their to give you business. Sad to see how downhill it has gone over the years!!!!",
