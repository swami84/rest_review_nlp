        "caption": "Would give more stars if I could. I was in the area for personal errands and this place seemed really inviting from the decor and scenery. The decor is really pretty and welcoming. Walked in after some hesitation.  So quick flashback about how this place made my day: When I was little my father got me these bake-able spinach empanadas from the grocery store. Had them a few times before they basically disappeared off the face of the Earth. I loved those things so much. I haven't been able to find a store that sold spinach empanadas for over 10 years. It's always chicken or beef. I'm an extremely picky eater and don't like to step out my comfort zone, so even if I did find a spinach empanada there was no guarantee I'd like the texture and filling. Needless to say I was a bit skeptical but thought I had nothing to loose.  This place sells dirt cheap empanadas ($2-3 if I remember correctly?). The food is fresh and prepared fast (maybe a 5 minute wait total). The staff is so nice and welcoming, (shoutout to the lady that took my order). I ordered two empanadas and they were so good. Everything was just right, I have no complaints. I wish I ordered more or tried the other flavors. I live an hour or more away from this place so it's not like I can just order them whenever or drop by. I don't even have any viable excuses to go out here regularly :(  It's at the top of my radar for when I'm in the area. Can't wait to try more spinach empanadas and all the other flavors. Kudos to this place for making my day great!  I'd love to go for indoor dining one day in the far distant future.",

        "caption": "This is a review of Belli Osteria as it was one year ago today, on December 27th, 2019.  Restaurants are experiences. You go out to eat because you don't have the time, energy, talent, care, or otherwise ability to cook. For me, dining out isn't just a break from my own cooking - it's an experience. If i'm paying for a waiter to take my order and pretend to care about my satisfaction, and a chef to cook my meal, I want it to be enjoyable.  Whoever you are, reading this, you'll have a different experience when you visit Belli Osteria, once that is indeed an option again, after COVID falls to its knees. You may go there alone after a long day of work, or with friends you haven't seen in a while, or with your wife for your anniversary -- because it is anniversary-worthy.  It's also perfect for a first date, which was my case. The cozy ambiance will dazzle you and whoever you're with. The yellow lights peppered throughout may dance in the glow of your date's eyes. They might even dance off of your eyes as you look at your date from across your table. It's romantic. It's quaint. It's charming. It's just right for the first impression with that special someone.  I ordered the homemade pappardelle with honey-braised short-rib ragu. She ordered the rigatoni with bolognese sauce. We both had a beer. The food was authentic and flavorful. The beer selection left nothing to be desired.  I always judge the level of server quality based on their presence. There's a thin line between too attentive and not attentive enough. Our server hit it square in the middle. Perfecto. One might wonder if the waitstaff at Belli Osteria are so attuned to the nuances of being just-present-enough because of the sheer quantity of dates that are brought here. Perhaps they have a good sense of it all.  I'm writing this review a year after dining here because i'm only now reflecting on the experience. Back before COVID, back when interactions were in-person rather than on Zoom, and back when restaurants were a full-fledged experience. Once we return back to the safety that once was, I encourage you, dear reader, to go to Belli Osteria. Though my romance fizzled out shortly after my dinner here, the romance of the restaurant itself still lingers in my mind as a great experience.",

Unfortunately the waitress did forget to put my food order through, so all my friends received theirs and finished them before mine made it out. She did apologise, but did not offer anything for this i.e. that particular dish complementary. We asked for an extra round after our 1.5 hours of bottomless was over, which was nice that they obliged as way of acknowledging we did not get to all eat together. The food was delicious, I had salmon and mash. The bottomless brunch deal is $25 for a brunch entree and bottomless mimosas, but you can add an extra $5 and get any of the main entrees instead of the brunch food. We found this great value for money and really enjoyed our couple of hours spent here and would return.",

The mozarella came with squash and this balsamic sauce. It was good and the squash tasted fresh. Just a warning though if you're looking for a cheese heavy dish, this dish was more squash than cheese. The rice balls were alright, if you're looking for something more fried then I'd recommend them.  I got the black spaghetti with clams as the main. It was delictibale, the spice from the chili added that extra kick to the dish and brought together the tastes of the clams and spaghetti perfectly.  The portions were big for all of those dishes and came out to be less than $50 with tip.",

Everyone loves Italian, so we walked over and had a quintessential NYC dining experience: lovely ambiance, attentive and friendly staff, a substantial menu and delicious food. We ordered mostly specials of the day: butternut squash soup (warm, rich, thick and just-right creaminess), arugula salad with slivered apples, pecans and gorgonzola), and homemade fettuccini with kale, sausage and tomato. Someone else had the butternut squash & marscapone ravioli, and another had lasagna, which came in a crockery dish smothered in sauce. My mouth is watering again... Interestingly, we were not asked if we wanted dessert after our meal. Likely a momentary oversight, but if you'd like to have one, you may need to ask. The restaurant is very intimate and also has a lovely bar, perfect for a drink with friends or solo. Overall, Belli is a worthwhile stop for dinner, and I hear their brunch is remarkable as well. This restaurant will stay on my list for another visit!",

The service is good & the staff is lovely  Food is always delicious, I actually loved their shaved brussels sprout salad so much that i recreated it at home.  We\u2019ve never had to make a reservation but it does fill up as it gets a bit later in the evening. If you go early it\u2019s much quieter. The last time we went was on a Thursday night a little before 9pm. We were at the tail end of the dinner rush, so the staff was a bit frazzled but it quieted down quickly & there wasn\u2019t any real delay in getting our food.  Belli has become a pretty regular spot for us. Also a good option when we just need to find a place and don\u2019t want to gamble with going somewhere that ends up being bad.  The truffle fries are delicious (but really everything is). You can\u2019t go wrong ordering a bunch of appetizers and sharing. And the pastas are also a good choice.",

It was just us and another couple in the entire Restaurant. Eventually they got up and had to ask for help. The second time was slow but not as bad. So why four stars?

        "caption": "This place was just okay. We went due to the high rating and craving Italian food, and while the food was decent it did not have us saying \"wow\". On top of that our service was pretty bad, it seems like our servers switched in the middle of our meal or our server just started ignoring us for some reason. The couple sitting next to us arrived later than us and got their food later than us, however the waitress took their plates and got the check for them while we just kept waiting and waiting with our plates empty wanting to go home! It seems like both the waitresses were ignoring us and not checking in at all during the meal. And it's not like they were very busy either, they were just hanging out by the register and I had to wave one of them down to finally get the check! Very frustrating. I like trying new places but personally if I ever have another Italian craving I will go back to Aita instead since they have consistently great food and attentive service.",

I think the fact that we had plans for after lunch made the pace of the service more annoying. The restaurant had dinners but it was not crowded, nor was it busy.  The problem seemed to be that there was only one waitstaff, the waitress who 'greeted' us when we arrived was the same person who was supposed to wait on us. It did not go well. The slow service persisted throughout the meal, in the end we paid and left without getting a bill.  Brunch included endless mimosas, but if your waitress is too scarce to offer refills... Now the food, I had a burger and it was good. The bun was a bit nondescript but the the meat tasted good, the fries were okay - good enough to eat without the unoffered ketchup.",
