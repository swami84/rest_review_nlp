They also give you some pickles on the side, which I really appreciate :)  Tenders: 4/5 These tenders are great. They're super tender and juicy and they also have their own special dipping sauce that makes it even better. The tender comes on a slice of regular white bread, which is eh. But the tender itself is great!  To be completely honest, this place is probably just as good at Howlin' Ray's. It might even be better since the line goes by a lot faster, too. There was a decent line when my friends and I arrived, but it went by pretty quickly. It's kind of hard to find a table when it's busy though. The service is great, nothing more to it! I highly recommend stopping by here!",

Everything I ordered for pickup during lockdown was always delicious and gave me an excuse to leave my house and now that there is outdoor dining, I am even more thrilled to live close by. Everything is set up safely, the seating in comfortable and the food is delicious as always!  I always check their Instagram for their specials and call in for pickup if I\u2019m doing takeout.",

I miss dining out so much. I forgot the joy and social experience that was lost in my life for the past 4 months.  Dining out gives me a joy that can\u2019t be filled. I don\u2019t go to a restaurant that often but the lost of the ability really eats into me after being a yelper for so long. I miss yelp events. I miss yelp writing and I miss mostly is food made by talented chefs. If this is the only way I can keep them from leaving the industry, I hope everyone will go out and dine once a week.  Beside the beautiful Friday breeze, we get to order food at a table. We went for a few rounds and order two appetizers. I am usually a cheap guy who get one and share but wth. German beer here is amazing. Crisp and super fresh. A good draft beer is hard to come by and here you can find it.  Food is delicious here. From their pretzels which is probably better than one you get in Germany to their famous calamari, I would order one of each items on the menu if my stomach allows.  Guys come find this place and give it a try. Social distance still",

Austrian street signage and advertisements, as well as a full-size motorcycle mounted over tables in the back room, are the venue\u2019s main design statements . But puckishly, the testosterone-flavored decor matches the locally unparalleled selection of bold draft beers and ciders and liquors and European soft drinks. A grapefruit juice - infused lager quaffs nicely and house cocktails named for faded movie stars from the day in Vienna are more than pleasant. For food, check out the daily chalkboard listings, or ask one of the servers such as charming Crystal for the special entrees. Pork, chicken and fish as schnitzel are staples at WERKSTAAT and quite worthy but much of the delight for diners comes in the sides. Each plays perfectly, in terms of taste, texture and presentation, with the meat or fish. Do not negotiate on swapping sides; you will cheat yourself and possibly annoy chef. WERKSTAAT also makes a statement on it payments, oddly takes only cash or  American Express cards to settle tabs that reflect good value.",

I've been in the Army for 18 years now and come up to NY once a year to visit the family and we decided to eat here this year. I've also eaten here many times in the past.  When I got to the restaurant I informed the server that I would need to bring my father through the handicap access. I thought that would be as simple as just opening the door and wheeling him in as there was a ramp about 2 feet from the table we were seated at.  A few minutes later and the manager or maybe owner comes over to discuss my request. She starts saying that I didn't tell her that we would need wheelchair access when we made the reservation and had she known that she would have seated us somewhere else. I tried to just agree with her and offer an apology as if it was my oversight. However, she was incessantly complaining over and over about how hard it was going to be to figure out how to wheel him in and seat him. She just kept whining and complaining that we did not let her know.  I didn't know until recently what my father's limitations actually were because his health has deteriorated. Maybe she could have thought to herself for a second of how hard it must be for the family to deal with having their father in this condition and how that compares to this supposedly huge ordeal we were putting her through.  She just assumed that he must have been handicapped his whole life or something and that she was owed some type of explanation. What I didn't understand about the whole situation was it literally just came down to allowing us to open a door and wheel him in about two feet in under 10 seconds.  And to the auto response from the business in advance. Next time just complain to your co-workers. You come off as unprofessional, lazy and ghetto when you start touting, \"we're just a small business\" directly to the customer as you complain to them about having to do a little work. That's all it came down to, was a little bit of work that you didn't even have to do so I don't know what the problem was.",

We split three appetizers: latkes, chicken liver mousse, and pork terrine. Entrees were roast chicken in white wine cream sauce, beef shoulder in red wine gravy, and cod schnitzel. We had a hell of a time choosing (the base menu has great options and there were LOTS of specials) and everything was delicious and generously portioned. I wish we'd had room for dessert!",

The staff at the bar were also accommodating in letting us change the game on the bar TV to the Nets\u2019 game and no one seemed to put up a stink about it. We ordered the pretzel, Wiener schnitzel, Kase spatzle, and linzer torte - all were delicious and savory!

Waitress didn't know the specials and kept trying to read the board. Worst of all, the back room had 1 occupied table when we arrived. We asked to just combine 2 tables to make it comfortable, instead we were stuffed into a corner. The area we requested sat empty most of the night. My hope is the restaurant has a wake up call, improves the food and wait staff right away. Sadly I won't be coming back ever again.",

The bratwurst is massive and came with sauerkraut, which seemed a bit overcooked, but the dish was very tasty. We had the bratwurst and eggs as well that my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed. We had the pretzel which was enormous and delicious with liptauer cheese and mustard on the side. I highly recommend that as a starter. I had the codfish schnitzel which came with four different delicious cold salads. We were stuffed but managed to share the linzer torte that was very delicious. Overall, werkstatt was very good. The service was very friendly and efficient.  The only disappointment we had was the Rosti potatoes. They were completely under cooked. They weren't Brown. They weren't crunchy. But that won't stop us from going back.",

Its so warm and inviting on a winter evening, and cool and beautiful in the summer in back with the Windows open. The beer is excellent. The Goulash is delicious.

To top it off, when my in'-laws came to visit from West Virginia they played Country Roads on the sound system as we sat down. It's too expensive for us to go to very often, but when we have family visiting its a great go-to place.",
