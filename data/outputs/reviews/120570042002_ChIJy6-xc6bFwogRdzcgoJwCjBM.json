I went ahead and read all the bad reviews before posting to make sure I wasn't missing something, but it seems like people are upset that they don't \"over pour\" drinks and that they are pricy. It's armature works and you're literally on the water for beautiful sunset views- both of the critiques are unfounded. If you want to pay less for more drink don't go somewhere this nice.  Drinks were great, prices were to be expected (not quite Disney level, but definitely a waterfront upgrade- just look at the menu before you order). Service was stellar, and the food was super fresh and tasty (seasoned but not overly). The food is meant to compliment the drinks, and it's not a full menu, so if you're looking for a nice meal first and foremost it might not be for you. The sauce on the tots was on point. The Debutante cocktail was a perfect Hendricks concoction. Sangria was fruity bliss.  Safety note: I went with a friend during reopening phase 1 after COVID-19 and they enforced social distancing during the wait time, had their servers wearing masks, gloves, and all tables were spaced out. The only bummer was the wait. I'd definitely recommend an open air place like this for a safe night out.",
