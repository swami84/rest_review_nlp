We order our usual chicken tikka masala and lamb do piyaza(I like raj darbars lamb do piyaza the most. Lots of onions and peppers with tender lamb) dishes come with rice or naan, you choose. My mother in law always gets an eggplant dish here. Only thing is, when you order soda they give you a glass of ice and a can. But last I checked it\u2019s BYOB so that makes up for it haha.

        "caption": "To make it quick: The food was great. My friend and I ordered chana masala with roti. I ordered an extra order of papadum, but never received it. I wasn't charged for it so, no harm no foul.  Our waiter was okay. He took quite a bit of time to take our order and my friend pretty much had to stop him and ask him if we could order. The place wasn't busy, mind you. It was around 9:45 on a Saturday night and they close at 11.  When we received our roti, I noticed it looked at as if had butter on it. I've been to other Indian restaurants and never received butter on my roti. I asked the waiter if the roti did in fact have butter on it and he said yes. I asked for an order of roti without butter. Here comes the fun part: I'm basically politely lectured that all Indian restaurants put butter on their roti, I can have anything customizable, and I basically should have said I didn't want butter. I had a college reading level when I was in middle school. I love to read. I read the menu and didn't see butter listed anywhere on the description for roti.  So, the waiter brings my roti and has to comment, \"Here is your roti WITHOUT BUTTER.\" I gave my friend a look to convey, \"No he didn't.\"  In summary: The food is good, but the service leaves a bit to be desired. If you have time to wait for your order or for your bill OR you're assertive, this is the place for you. I'm not sure if I'll be back considering Chicago has a lot of Indian restaurants.",

Once a michillin bib restuarant, they haven't lost their finesse. I wouldn't get the biryani though, as it was my least favorite thing there. The service sometimes leave a little to be desired, as there seems little communication between the kitchen and front of house.",

I've never been inside, so my \"Good\" rating for decor is a wild guess. But if you want Indian food delivered to your door, I don't think it's possible to do better than Raj Darbar. Everything is good. They have a bunch of different types of naan, which is somewhat unusual. I like it, the potato filled one and the garlic are both great. Also love the samosas and chicken tikka masala. The epitome of consistency.",
