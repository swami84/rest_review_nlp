Close to our hotel, Royal Sonesta, in Cambridge so decided to give it a try.  It was fabulous.  The employees all very professional and polite.  Our waiter, Wais, was very friendly, helpful and had the nicest smile.  He helped guide us through the menu as we were not familiar with the Afgan dishes.  He brought out  the freshly baked flatbread which was so good along with the three accompanying sauces which added delightful flavors.  We all tried different entrees which were all delicious, lamb, beef, ravioli and a vegetarian dish.  The atmosphere was very nice and they seated the six of us at a round table which  made conversation easy among all.  Overall it was a wonderful meal and would highly recommend.  We will come back if ever in Boston again.  Thank you Helmand Restaurant and Wais for a lovely meal our last night in Boston.  Wishing you continued success with your restaurant.",

Appetizers and soups were flavorful and unique, though I was surprised at the similarities between Indian and Afghani cuisine on my entr\u00e9e. Great service.  ITEMS ORDERED: Kaddo (baked baby pumpkin appetizer topped with yogurt garlic sauce and ground beef sauce); Mushawa (lamb and yogurt soup); Lam Lawand.  PROs: It\u2019s a dimly-lit, beautifully decorated restaurant that appears authentic in design with some museum-like displays. The appetizer and soup were all flavorful and unique. The staff is warm and friendly, and an older crowd make up most of the patrons. The staff was friendly, and my server was very helpful and courteous.  CONs/CONSIDERATIONS: The entr\u00e9e bore striking resemblance to Indian food for me. I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s the norm, though I suppose it\u2019s not surprising given the proximity between the two countries. Also, the lamb in my entr\u00e9e was quite dry, and didn\u2019t have too much flavor except from the sauce that accompanied it. I found it disappointing. This is a big deal for me since (1) the entr\u00e9e is the foundation for a meal, and (2) the entr\u00e9e was a recommendation by the server as one of the more popular items.  RATING: I\u2019m tempted to assign a 3-star rating to Helmand because of my disappointment in the entr\u00e9e. However, because I felt Helmand exceled in all other areas (appetizer, service, environment and d\u00e9cor), I\u2019m opting to provide 4 stars. I\u2019ll be back to try other entr\u00e9es in the future.",

Also, don\u2019t skip dessert! The backlawa was divine, and the rice pudding was decadent.

The pumpkin ravioli melts in your mouth. Lamb chops that were perfectly spiced and charred on the outside, while tender and juicy on the inside.  Delicately flavoured rice.

Our hostess gave us a warm welcome which was appreciated. I was able to stay keto friendly and I had the rack of lamb and just did not eat the rice or the bread. My husband and 8 year old son shared the qabelee. Our picky son devoured this dish where the tender pieces of lamb in the rice were complimented by raisins and carrots. We had lovely service from Mr. Habib. His smile was genuine, was attentive and made us feel like valued guests. We are looking forward to more visits! Thank you!",

Can't but end up doing it anyway \ud83d\ude05). This restaurant is spectacular from all aspects. I have sincerely enjoyed dining there. The atmosphere is very homey. You seldom feel like that in a public restaurant unfathomable! The staff interactions felt really genuine. Shout out to the manager/host at the reception table he was very welcoming and warm. Never been offered to take my bags and coat ever before at a restaurant, so that was a great start. They just went the extra mile. Os (short for Osman) was in training and he did a great job, shout out to him, thank you! Lastly but not least was the food; delicious is an understatement, the lamb was perfectly cooked (medium rare) tasty, and you can cut it with a fork, so tender. The mint stuff was superb and.... I mean I can't say enough, it was ridiculously good! Definitely would recommend going there for sure, don't hesitate you'll love it. I was organizing a meetup for a group of wonderful friends. And it was successful, so thank you Helmand and everyone working there for making it as such; cheers!",

We were served different sauces to start with a basket of flat, freshly made bread. We got to sit right by their big stone oven so we saw it coming out fresh. Then we got an appetizer that was two thin-crust pockets: one filled with sauteed leeks, the other filled with spiced potatoes. They were served with a very think yogurt. These were seriously so good!! For our entree, one of us had the special vegetarian, which had okra, pumpkin, eggplant, and spinach served with rice. I had a nightly special of mung beans and black eyed peas, kind of like a gumbo but the flavor was so amazing; served with a poblano pepper baked and stuffed with sauteed spinach, and covered in cheese. Omg can't even describe how good everything tasted! Only con is that the dishes are a little pricey (average $16-22/plate, lowest seemed to be $14 highest seemed to be $28), and their wine list wasn't the best (lots of new world wines and pricey). Place has a full bar and the staff was so sweet and friendly. They have you check backpacks with the hostess, but it wasn't a big deal, they were very professionally about it. This place is so delicious, try something new, GO EAT HERE! :)",

Our server was struggling to attend to all the tables, and we wasted a lot of time waiting for him. We saw him make coffee out in the middle of tables (that took a while !). There are a lot of tables in this place, and it feels more of an assembly line operation than authentic Afgani.  Not recommended at all !",

The waiter asked if we wanted wine and when we said no, she looked so dissappointed and angry that we were surprised. We hadn't asked her any information about it either to make her feel we wanted wine. Then, someone else served us food which went well. The food didn't taste that great. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not perfect like last time. Then we ordered dessert and some coffee, both were very good, and hence I have given 3 stars. I got left overs packed and they charged me for a brown bag. I know stores charge for plastic bags but what kind of a cheap restaurant charges for a brown bag? Moreover, in their suggested tip section, they added the tip on the total amount including tax instead of just food. Most restaurants write the suggested tip based on just food. The guy who came to give us the check talked to us very politely and explained our waiter was busy and hence, he was collecting the check. He thanked us for coming as well. I think we just got unlucky with waiter who served us.",
