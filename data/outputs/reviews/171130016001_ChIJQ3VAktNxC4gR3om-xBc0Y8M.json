One that stands-out is that the Brass Pig offers collared greens, this is a must have and you'd be amazed at how many places do not offer it!  Everything I've had on the menu has been handmade, homemade, and a homerun.  The space is open, friendly, clean, smart, and spacious.  The offerings at the bar are also (details) what you would expect to see in an authentic BBQ house- bourbons and whiskeys, and they only have local beers on tap- that was a very nice touch.  As I have been to BBQ joints all across the country, it is obvious the owners have a lot of experience in the restaurant industry, the Brass Pig is a must. -Chris",

I tried out the brisket sandwich with one side and got the slaw.  When I ordered,  they didn't offer the sandwich often.  And the day I got it MAY have been the first day for it.  The flavor of the meat and sauce was DELISH.  The pickled onion on it was a little too sharp for me.  And I felt the amount of meat was pretty small for the $12 price tag.  The large bun just accentuated the situation.  Go big or go home when it comes to the Q!  Slaw was good, not too creamy and ordinary - nothing inventive.",

The items we've tried are: - Smoked Beef Ribs - Turkey Club - Notorious P.I.G. - Brisket Point Burger - Smoked Sausage - BP Cuban - Chicken Tenders - Coleslaw - Fried Corn on the Cob - BBQ Mac n Cheese - Gi Gi's Cucumber & Onion - AD's Smoked Pork Tater Salad  I could write a lot about each of these items but to save room, in short, you'll be glad you tried this place no matter what you get. I'm looking forward to trying the Smoke Wings!  We've tried all but a couple types of sauces and, in short, they're just pure magic. They are very original and memorable sauces that have their own style and signature. I especially love the Spicy Mustard sauce for the fact that it isn't spicy due to a vinegar taste, it's more of a BBQ Mustard with a smokiness to it and just the right level of spice that doesn't overpower the complex flavors (and it ties all the flavors together very well on the Turkey Club especially!)  Experiences:  06/03/2020 Ordered a casual lunch for my wife and I and were totally blown away by the Turkey Club w. Coleslaw and the Notorious P.I.G. w. Fried Corn Cob we tried, as well as a side of beans. We received a personal phone call after our meal to see how it was, and we absolutely loved that personal touch and attention to feedback by the owners. Great customer service!  06/06/2020 After having a great lunch earlier in the week, we decided to order out for our small family gathering of 10 or less, and ordered up a smorgasbord of all different options from a new local favorite. Everything was delicious and blew us away. We all talked about our different favorite items and what I found interesting was there were many of us with different favorites \u2013 A great sign of a well-designed menu.  There were a few sides missing at first from our pickup when we got home, but I was thoroughly impressed by the customer service from the owner who took charge of the situation right away after a quick call and brought the missing items right to my house even though they don't have delivery! I tried to give him a tip but he respectfully declined and wished us a great dinner. Even threw in a couple extra items for us! I couldn't believe it. It really brightened up our night even more! Thank you Brass Pig!",
