The food tasted good, and the all-you-can-eat deal included appetizers, drinks, maki rolls, sashimi, nigiri, and specialty rolls.  We ordered a pretty large initial batch, which they brought out in a paced fashion; as we finished a plate, they would swap it out for a new plate full of food.  Once we finished our initial batch, service got a bit slower, but we were able to get refills on our waters and soda before they announced \"last call\" before closing.  We ordered a second round of just nigiri at last call to cap off the evening, which worked out well to quench any remaining hunger.  With that said, you may ask why it was only given 4 stars.  I think it is very close to earning 5 stars, but there were a few things that I think need to be improved upon for a full 5 star rating.  First and foremost, better service.  Wait staff should be checking on you very shortly after you finish a plate to let you know that another is coming or to offer you the option to order more.  Secondly, it would be nice to see more options on their list of maki rolls.  There were no options for smoked salmon rolls despite offering smoked salmon as sashimi/nigiri, and most rolls had spicy mayo, which I dislike.  Also having more options with unagi would be appreciated as well.  So overall, a great experience, and we will come back, but I would love to see the above improvements next time we come in.",

My friend had been craving this place for over a month and we finally came in. It wasnt very busy only a couple tables. The server was very short borderline rude, the sushi was served WARM. The tea took over 20 minutes to be served. I really wanted to like this place because of the reviews but unfortunately that wasnt the case. Everything we ordered took a long time and the flavors were bland. We had to keep asking where the order was, since only 1 thing would be brought out at a time with a minimum of 15 20minutes for the next plate. Only 1 person could eat at a time at our table.I will not be returning after this cluster mess of a \"dining\"experience",

We didn't feel like we should have paid full price since we only ate half of what we ordered! They refused to give  any discount whats so ever. Their customer service sucked and the chef came out and said that our complaints were not acceptable because we had been at the resturant for a long time. The time we spent sending our food back!!

Little did I know that I was about to have one of the most uncomfortable and insulting experiences of my life in a restaurant. I informed our waitress that I had an avocado allergy, and she told me to order the \"all you can eat\" sushi on a separate paper from the rest of the group (which seemed sensible to me). 10 minutes after ordering, a man (who I found out was the owner, Paul) came over and asked who had the allergy, and told me he couldn't guarantee that the cutting boards and knives they used were clean, so I should order from the \"kitchen menu.\" I was incredibly uncomfortable about his inability to guarantee hygienic food preparation, but took the menu and ordered from it, assuming that he meant I needed to order from the normal menu. Another 10 minutes later he came over again, even more rudely chastised me for having ordered from the menu, saying I didn't order a \"kitchen meal.\" I asked him several times what he wanted me to order, and told him I didn't understand what a \u201ckitchen meal\u201d was, and he proceeded to ignore my question and repeatedly tell me why he couldn't guarantee my food would be free of avocado and why people with my allergy couldn\u2019t eat their food. He offered me free edamame, which I I refused since we already had 2 plates of edamame, and because edamame isn\u2019t a meal. He kept harassing me even when I said it was fine and that I didn\u2019t want to order anything else, and I clearly wanted to be left alone.  I eventually had to tell him that he was making me uncomfortable and that I simply wouldn't eat dinner, and he kept criticizing my ordering. I had to insist that he leave because at this point he was embarrassing me in front of my group and making me feel like my allergy was an insurmountable inconvenience, not something that restaurants have to deal with on a daily basis. Since I hadn't gotten any food of my own, I started noshing on the shared food we had ordered at the beginning of the meal when I had ordered the first time. Paul then came over in a huff and told me I couldn't eat the spring rolls or edamame we had because I wasn't paying for for the sushi menu (which I would have gladly paid for if they had let me order from it).  He essentially refused to serve me because of my allergy, and then told me I couldn\u2019t eat food I had ordered as part of a group while planning to partake in the family style food. This restaurant is despicable. This was one of the worst and most uncomfortable experiences of my life. Nobody with allergies, food restrictions, or an expectation of basic respect should ever eat at this restaurant. Paul in particular should not be allowed to speak to customers, especially women, who he obviously doesn't respect. I have never been so appalled at service, or been made to feel so ashamed in a restaurant for having a food allergy.",

We also love that it's BYOB - we usually grab a bottle or two of white wine from the TJ's just down the street (they'll have some stuff chilled but you have to ask them to get it from the back room). I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5 because the last time we went I noticed how low the lighting was - I would have liked a bit more light so I could enjoy the presentation of our rolls first. Hadn't really noticed this before so maybe it was just the section we were in this time. I also am am a fuddy-duddy who doesn't like having to push a button to call over a server or check off my order on a paper ticket - but this place is a lot busier than it use to be so I can understand why they've opted to simplify & streamline service. It's also a style that might appeal to anyone who has ever been annoyed by the frequency of table checks or doesn't like trying to pronounce unfamiliar menu items.",

If you pay in cash, you get an extra $2 off per person, so when you factor this in, the prices are not bad at all considering the sushi is freshly prepared, rather quickly too, and tastes pretty good! Newly added to the all you can eat roster are unlimited appetizers, including seaweed salad, unbelievably good crab Rangoon, and miso soup, among many others. Service is always attentive, and very pleasant. One of my favorite places in Lincoln Square!",

I was really hungry,  and I looked for an all you can eat restaurant. The sushi was made was above average but changing my order twice is just weird. It took 60 mins to serve 24pcs. Maybe it's because its starting to get busy. OK, three times, wth.  They changed ALL my orders. Leaving sunday 10/16/16 8pm.  Don't eat here on weekends. I wanted sake after but im just leaving.",

The way you order here was unique to me at first but it is a great system. The waiter/waitress will bring you a menu, you mark down how many sets of each item. After you are done, you press a button that calls over your server and they take the menu. After your food is done, they bring it out as many at a time as possible.  The food is delicious. I've haven't been to a Sushi restaurant where the fish is that fresh. They have a huge variety of items to pick, from the Avocado roll to the Dragon roll, from the Spicy Tuna to the Rainbow roll. They also have other items apart from rolls, such as crab ragoons.  Overall, really great experience with fresh Sushi. I would definitely come again.",

If you've never done all you can eat sushi here are some tips. - Do not go it alone.  You'll get more bang for your buck and variety if you have someone or someoneS (preferably with big stomachs) to share the experience with. - You have to eat everything you order. Some exceptions do apply but waste is not an option.  Order wisely and get group buy-in before committing to an entire maki. - Don't bother filling up on non-sushi items.  You've gotta put your game face on and be ready to eat your dollars worth in rolls.  Find a balance between liquid and solid. - Most importantly: Know thyself.  You're in it to win it but there's no reason to hurt yourself.  Eat within your limits. Bonus tip: It's probably wisest not to take a date on an all you can eat excursion.  You will look like a fat pig and that's just not sexy.  My experience here is as it has been at other AYCE places.  It's hard to find fault in an all you can eat joint that is clean, friendly, and responsive.  Wasabi Cafe hits all of these.  Admittedly I am a sushi snob.  I've come to grips that I'm not going to have my freshness or variety needs satisfied here in the midwest.  If I'm craving and in starved like a crazed animal mode, I'll definitely head on over to Wasabi Cafe and have a good time.  Price is about what you'd expect and I found everything more than palatable.  Come.  Bring your friends.  Do it up big time.",
