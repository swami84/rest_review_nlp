When we asked about it they said they haven't made it yet and apologized.  So I said well if you haven't made it yet can I change it to a different dish.  They said yes.  Well the dish arrived and it didn't seem like the dish we changed to.  Only after I asked come to find out they made the original dish and didn't tell us.  If they didn't agree to make the change then they shouldn't have said yes.  Also if they gave us the original dish they should have told us what it was.  I was a little disappointed about he deception or lack of explanation but overall it was a good experience.",

        "caption": "We were visiting from out of town and looking forward to trying this specific izakaya due to good word of mouth and online reviews.  A few days before we began our vacation, I called the restaurant for a reservation but nobody picked up so I left a voicemail with my request and contact information. The next day, someone from Torae Torae called back and took our reservation information down. Great, all set right?  Fast forward a week later and we arrive a few minutes ahead of our reservation. I speak with an employee who greeted me as we entered. Surprisingly they said they couldn't seat us because all tables were full and the next available slot would be nearly 2 hours later.  I asked how this was possible and whether they had record of my reso. The employee showed me a list of people the restaurant had called at some point to reconfirm reservations and my name was on there. He went on to explain that another employee had gone down the list and that it showed they'd made an effort but since nobody replied that they'd cancelled our reservation.  I remarked that nobody had called us the entire week since we had made the initial reservation. My phone's call log showed no missed calls and the only number I received from an 808 area code was the initial call to establish the reservation.  We asked if takeout was possible but they said the kitchen was too busy and the employee apologized for the situation but unfortunately Torae Torae couldn't rebook us as we were leaving the next morning.  All in all, a pretty poor customer experience. I don't believe they made the call to reconfirm but assuming they did, wouldn't best practice be to leave a voicemail? Restaurants that haven't moved to fully online bookings often call and the staff will leave messages - why not implement this simple task?  Also I get that they're likely popular and doing fairly well so maybe they've made a conscious decision to refrain establishing 1) a fully online booking system -- there's plenty of services/tools available today and 2) haven't allocated any effort to having a functioning website that actually works.  I hope they do take these suggestions for improvement to heart - they're incremental costs but I imagine it'd result in a much smoother and efficient operation that's beneficial for customers and employees alike.",

Interior: Really brings me back to the time I spent in Tokyo. The walls have many gorgeous paintings as well. They have an open kitchen where you can watch all the action if you so choose to sit at the sushi counter.  *I suggest calling ahead for a reservation or to check how busy it is as it can get really crowded! Or\u3001come early because during happy hour the place is packed!  I arrived Wednesday night around 9:15 and was seated quickly.  *Happy hour starts at 10p.m  I wanted to take advantage of the happy hour prices so we chose some starter items/drinks while we waited. For the drinks CHU-HAI one of my favorite things to drink in Japan. A yummy sweet cocktail with many different fruit flavors.  Food: I started off with the mini ramen which had a nice flavor to it. And of course the soft boiled egg which is a must have! The Asari miso soup has a nice clam taste throughout. As for the sushi rolls the hideyoshi roll was yummy. I think the highlights were the ahi tataki\u3001and the pork belly don! Ahi was nice and fresh and the sauce completed it\u3001 the don was huge for its HH price. Big pieces of pork\u3001a yummy soft egg\u3001and a piece of daikon which brings it together. I liked mixing the egg with the rice and putting a piece of daikon with pork and taking a nice big mouthful.  Great shareable: The truffle edamame! Omg I could eat this forever. I literally ordered 4 servings for myself.  Service: Top notch\u3001 helped me choose my order\u3001very knowledgable on the menu and overall great. Bri definitely helped make the night am enjoyable one.  Overall: Excellent place\u3001from the food down to the service! Hide makes excellent food and I highly recommend you yelpers to experience it yourself.",

Of all the izakayas I've ever been, the food here is one of my favorites.  Parking here was difficult because there are roughly only 12 spots and way more patrons. People ended up making their own parking spots \ud83d\ude44  We did not have reservations but were seated right away at the bar. We really enjoyed watching him work and he was a great conversationalist.  We ordered the yuzu ichiko, the red dragon roll, the hamachi collar, and the ahi tartar. Everything was good but that hamachi collar was incredible. We had intended to start with these and order more but the hamachi was enough for both of us. It was rich and the spicy grated daikon helped to cut some of that fat.  I get very hangry when I have to wait for a while for food but I didn't mind here because the conversation and libations were phenomenal",

I had my heart set on uni so we got the negi otoro ikura don and I opted for it with uni. They only had Japanese uni, so if you're not wanting to spend a lot, keep in mind the price hike with that Japanese uni! To add to the meal, we had hamachi carpaccio, vegetable tempura, and the crunchy tuna roll. All of which were really on point! I'll be back for sure!",

My 3 year old and I came in very hungry but with high expectations because of the high ratings. We actually walked around and waited for 15 minutes for the restaurant to open for dinner. When we stepped in, since that my child doesn\u2019t feel that she could eat comfortably at the restaurant, I asked to order food for us to bring back to our hotel. The chef refused, saying that they can\u2019t sell us food because they are busy. I was confused, saying it\u2019s the same, we just need some boxes. The chef continued to refuse, turned my 3 year old and me away hungry unapologetically.  I went back to the hotel and did more research. Yelp clearly indicates that the restaurant does takeout. So I called the restaurant and asked what\u2019s their rule for when they do takeout and when not. The woman on the phone told me the chef decides on the fly and there is no rule. When I told her that they need to state their rules clearly on their website so that customers are not randomly turned away, she hang up on me.  This experience clearly says that they don\u2019t care about the customers. They care about grabbing as much money as possible (in my case the tip since that\u2019s the only difference between us dining at the restaurant or packing the food for eating at the hotel). They don\u2019t care even if the customer has hungry small children. That to me is not a restaurant worth good business.",

Reason is simple: It's a welcoming place with fresh sashimi, diverse variety of menu items (from fry to grill to roll to nigari to sashimi to ochazuke to dessert), good customer service, and most importantly (drum roll) i don't have to wait 3 months for a reservation!  On a weekday, I can easily walk in and grab a seat.  On a weekend, I can make a reservation hours ahead and get lucky 95% of the time.  The rest of the 5%?  Probably everyone wants to eat there the same time as me.  The restaurant is small, but they do what they can to accommodate their guests.  Most of the time the owner/ chef/ master (Hideyoshi) is behind the counter orchestrating the kitchen.  As for the menu selections, I have yet to have a bad dish there.  I usually end up trying something different depends on my mood.  Thanks Yelp again for the reminder coz I will go back for more than a few times for sho!",
