Let me tell you, we were very surprised... everything we heard was not even close.. it was a fantastic experience. Me, that was in the food industry for a few years, and very critical of food venues, was pleasantly surprised. There is only a beer and wine license, which is fine by me. Also, the open kitchen was a pleasure to see. The cleanliness here is top notch. I ordered for an appetizer the MOZZARELLA EN CARROZZA, I use upper case for a reason. The quality was one of the best that I have eaten. The size was tremendous! It made French Toast look small! A meal onto itself, and superb flavor. My entr\u00e9e was Veal Marsala, prepared perfectly. I had to take half of it home, so much I couldn't finish it. I will be returning here again very soon. I have also recommended this venue to many friends. I wish the staff here all the best and I will see them soon.",

The sauce was amazing and sweet, never like I have had it before. Topped with amazing garnishes that I will not expose because I want you to go there and see for yourself. But wait it doesn't end there, the chef/owners were amazing, friendly and more than attentive, the prices were more than fair. We had the bread pudding for desert and it was amazing and highly recommended.

I found this gem. To start customer service on the phone was great to the way the food was delivered and packaged to the sweet delivery man. The mussels to die for so FRESH and flavorful, the penne vodka was just perfect, chicken milanese OMG huge portion and i could eat that meal everyday chicken perfectly cooked the arugula with a lemon dressing WOW. I ordered a plain pasta garlic and oil to say the flavor was no plain pasta thats for sure. I hope this place stays in business and continues to thrive with the help of the community because this place is so worth having in sunset park. I will definitely be eating again every time i visit.

There are all the basics necessities: tables, silverware, chairs, kitchen, maybe a bathroom and of course, your uncle running a one man show dressed in a t-shirt and basketball shorts. Needless to say, the dress is casual. The decor is pretty basic and there is a piano as well as some guitars when the band comes to play.  Customer service reflects being treated like family. Although the customer service was great, what really blew me away was the food that came out of this small kitchen! TOP OF THE LINE stuff for sure. Everything made fresh and from scratch. Quality of food is definitely something that is valued here. We ordered the New York Classic Chicken with marinara and Chicken Alfredo. The portions are large! We also ordered a personal pan deep dish pizza as a starter. None of the food disappointed. Everything was delicious!  Expect to pay for quality though - $51 for the three dishes that could easily be shared. My date and I had plenty of leftovers to take with us. Well worth it!",
