This is my second time here in 1 week and I HAVE to leave a review! \ud83c\udf55 I\u2019ve visited Italy and tasted authentic pizza and I have hated American pizza ever since. This bistro right here is baking and selling you the truth \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\u2728I\u2019m in love once again and never want pizza from any other place. They understand that real pizza has thin crust, that they are smaller in size, and the ingredients of the toppings are fresh and simple and baked to a loving bakedness. They apply just enough sauce they don\u2019t inundate and flood the dang pizza like these American chains.
