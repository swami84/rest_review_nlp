Osteria della Pace was one of the favorite restaurants of a mutual friend who is no longer with us...but, C was certainly with us in spirit!  The menu selections are very precise and have a reason to exist on the roster of choices.  Very limited number of dishes, assuring us of the peak of freshness and taste.  Began with shared appetizers of the grilled octopus, beets with endive and Burrata with diced pears.  Incredible!  The focaccia arrived twice, very generously.  A fine Rose, extremely well priced introduced  our entrees.  2 of my guests had pork, one had ravioli and I   indulged in penne with ragu.  And yes, we had a simple assortment of sorbets.  Service staff was very well paced, friendly, informed, and professional.  A beautiful table was reserved for us...hats off to our hostess, who so carefully assisted us in every way possible, knowing the occasion of our dining in this particular restaurant was of significant import.  Memorable, indeed!  Thank you all!!!",

Our table became ready, but we chose to stay at the lounge, and had the eggplant parmigiana stack, the ziti with veal and a side of greens (definitely enough for 2).  The service was well paced, giving us time to enjoy the burrata, conversation, wine, and enjoy the perfectly cooked mains once they arrived.  Our server, Carlos did an incredible job, even grating our cheese when the person running the food neglected to.   Phenomenal food, caring attentive service.",

While looking at IDs she poured beer in the glasses and overdid it, so it all ran down the table onto our wardrobe. This happened twice in a row. She asked if wardrobe was okay and offered help, so that's a little plus. Waiters & waitresses seem to be nice, but the service is more like calling someone if you want something and not like the staff asking the customers if everything is ok, etc.. The high tables are also kinda wobbly, therefor when you cut food like pizza, you don't want to have full glasses on the table. The food is OK. not great. But considering the price it's heavily overpriced. Seriously you pay twice for the location and triple for the name. Drinks are aswell really really expensive. I would not recommend to go there.",

I came here for an afternoon lunch in a party of four. I\u2019ve been to Eataly in the past and enjoyed my experience. What changed was trying to visit an Italian restaurant on a diet with specific restrictions.  The first issue was my order - a salad - arrived almost 10 minutes after the rest of my groups hot pasta dishes.  I couldn\u2019t snack on the complimentary bread since I\u2019m eating gluten and dairy free.  I dove into the salad starved, only to discover it contained walnuts - which I specifically asked to be removed when placing the order. (The waiter admitted his mistake. )  To make matters worse, the \u201cpoached tuna\u201d was absolutely disgusting. I had googled it prior to ordering, and I was expecting something different. I thought it was fresh tuna, poached to warm it up a bit. I got slimy and extremely  salty pieces of fish. Not Osterias fault but it led to me decide not to try to eat the rest of the meal after a few bites.  Management decided to treat my table to deserts. A tirimisu topped with chocolate and some ice cream. I\u2019m dairy free and allergic to chocolate. Not to mention I\u2019m on a f*ing diet which is why I ordered salad in the first place.  In the end they removed my salad from the bill, which is good since it was wrong and I didn\u2019t eat a meal. My personal experience was 1 star as I left hungrier than I arrived.  But ... My party had three wonderful pasta dishes, yummy cocktails, and complimentary fresh bread, and deserts (courtesy of my order mix up). They even took special care to check for my fathers food allergy and when it got too sunny they lowered the shades. Which for them would\u2019ve been a 5-star experience (had I not been hangry at the table.  So yea.",

I dined at around 1 PM and the crowd was a bit loud.  I haven't eaten here before so I can only judge the dishes I tried today. The Spaghettoni ai Tre Pomodori was very oily with a small amount of shellfish. The shellfish was sandy and rubbery from being overcooked. The sauce has red pepper flakes in it and my dish came with a clump of them which I didn't notice until my mouth was aflame. The Capesante e Topinambur came with 4 very plump scallops which were cooked to perfection but were incredibly salty and sandy. The sunchokes didn't have any salt and so when the scallops & sunchokes were eaten together, the level of seasoning was fine. I like to eat separate bites of the dish and not mash everything together so I won't be ordering this again.",

For an Italian it's a bit disorienting because the restaurant is American after all, so the way the menu is written, the way the tables are set and orders are taken, etc still work like an American restaurant. To give a couple of examples, some Italian recepies vary wildly across regions and they are not always specified (they were all delicious nevertheles), Italians also put a lot of emphasis on table preparation while here it was pretty bare bones, but despite this shuffling of cultures it was still really cozy, the staff was extremely nice to us and c'mon the food was great.",

First of all the service was terrible.  The waitress never introduced herself, and I had to ask her for water several times.   She brought over a wooden board for bread, but we never received the bread till after our dinners were served.   The olive oil that comes with the bread is very good, but make sure you ask them to fill the very small bowl, because it is not enough for 3 people.  My wife had a glass of wine and the waitress took her  empty glass away after appetizers and never asked her if she would like another glass of wine with her dinner.  My mom's sparkling water cost more than my wife's glass of wine, which is absolutely absurd.  The grilled octopus was tasty, but a bit too salty for my taste buds.  The red snapper was not cooked thoroughly.  I did not care for the puree with the snapper.  My mom had the linguine and clams and she did say it was fresh and tasty.  There is no salt, pepper or cheese on tables.  You need to ask for this and then have to wait.   Apparently, after dinner the shift changed and the waitress that we had left and we had someone else.  We had coffee, cappuccino and dessert.  There was no milk for coffee and so we asked the server to please bring it.  He forgot and continued to clean tables around us.  By the time we received the milk the coffee was getting cold and no spoons were given with the coffee to stir.  I hope that this review helps the manager who is running this restaurant.  This was not an off day.  Not one person who waited on us was pleasant, or helpful.  I would not frequent this restaurant again.",

The restaurant is situated in the corner of the building giving you great views of the 9/11 memorial area and the surrounding financial district.  Going for lunch we nonetheless decided to go for a 3-course meal.  We all started off with the octopus which was absolutely perfect. I could have eaten this dish all day long. Probably, the best preparation of octopus I've eaten.  Unfortunately, things went downhill from that point. We all went for different pastas, but none of us were thrilled by them, they were standard pasta dishes that you could get pretty much anywhere. The portion sizes weren't great and overly expensive.  For dessert the panna cotta was okay, but the accompanying side that came with it was absolutely gross. Kept trying to figure out what they were trying to achieve in terms of taste but gave up as it was totally disgusting. The chocolate dessert was okay but again nothing to shout about.  The service was pleasant and the restaurant wasn't too noisy, even though it was full.  It's just a shame the food wasn't better after the first course and the expensive prices didn't help, which turned it into a slightly disappointing experience.",
