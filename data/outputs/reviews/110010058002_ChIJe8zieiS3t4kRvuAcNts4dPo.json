        "caption": "My dad and I came the day after they opened, and then again the Saturday after -- twice in a week, and we absolutely loved both times. It's very difficult for a restaurant to have everything up and running so smoothly opening week, and yet Tonari's kitchen and front of house staff were flawless. Service was extremely friendly and approachable without hovering, and each dish we ordered was perfect. Sharing a couple starters, a pasta dish, a pizza, and dessert was more than plenty, and we were pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive the bill was. Wafu (Japanese style) Italian isn't \"fusion\" -- it's an interpretation of Italian food by Japanese chefs using Japanese ingredients. The pizza crust itself could get a whole review by itself. A three day fermentation process that produces an incredibly pillowy, feathery crumb structure with a crisp outside made possibly by the rice oil coating the pan. Think shokupan, but twice as soft and fluffy. As a homebaker who makes both sourdough and shokupan, I was so so impressed. The seating upstairs is an experience in itself -- there's a kotatsu seating area, and a miniature live garden in the cenre of the main dining space. So picturesque and it really added to the atmosphere. Our favourites that we would come back again and again for are the uni pasta, the hawaiian pizza, the panna cotta (the yamamomo itself is phenomenal -- like fermented strawberry) and the grapefruit granite. Truly one of our favourite restaurants and another success by Daikaya Group.",

The pasta dishes are lovely, with wonderful rice noodles and sauces that are reminiscent of Italian food. The Wafu pizza is good, and the crust is the real winner - light and spongy I would eat this alone! Overall an interesting choice if you are craving Italian food with a twist.",

Our server was icy and aggressive about clearing plates and glasses, even when we were still in the middle of eating dishes (like half of the food still left on a shared plate in a middle course, and she would take the individual plates we were actively eating off of). But the co-owner there was making table visits and was warm and funny, an appreciated touch for a new place. Definitely made me want to return despite our server. Food was lovely and interesting, something new for DC. I have never had anything quite like perfectly!! al dente spaghetti with Cod roe, but it was a delightful flavor and experience. The \"deep dish\" style pizza, well, that's thre first time I've actually enjoyed the style. Ricotta could use some salt compared to the otherwise beautifully seasoned dishes we got, but a lovely combo with the edamame.",

The foam on the tiramisu was a bit much but the actual dessert was fine. Same with the panna cotta and the chocolate mousse; good standard desserts.  The pasta texture was great! Chewy and satisfying to eat. The flavor was also decent, although for the kinoko specifically I couldn't taste much Japanese influence...  The mentaiko pizza was... interesting. It's an odd concept to put mentaiko with corn and cheese but the dough was great and the crust was crispy.  General atmosphere was good, there was plenty of space and it didn't fee crowded at all. Noise level was fairly low, you didn't have to strain to hear your other party members and the upstairs had traditional Japanese seating which looked like a good experience. Downstairs the open kitchen concept was cool.  Overall... would go back for the grapefruit granite but the main courses didn't stand out from the general DC dinner fare.",

It was a strange combination, but it worked well. The sweetness of the corn, there fluff of the dough, it was great.  The service was okay, not great. Our waitress felt a little scripted, but I'm sure that within a couple weeks, she'll be more comfortable (I think the restaurant opened able a week ago).

The exterior of the restaurant is pretty compelling with its stark black facade, and I thought the interior was quite crisp and clean too. Having gone with a group, I had a chance to try the uni pasta and natto bolognese as well as the Hawaiian and mentaiko & corn pizzas. Though I knew what I was getting into, I'll note that there's no mention of what natto is on the menu and I can see some people being surprised by the powerful smell and slightly-less-powerful-but-still-funky taste of it if this dish was ordered out of curiosity. However, I think the pizza is real winner over the pasta. I'm not enough of a pizza connoisseur to say this is decisively Detroit-style, but the rectangular shape, crispy oiled crust, and brick cheese suggest that it's pretty close. The interior of the pizza is soft and fluffy in contrast to the crust, which I really enjoyed. Hawaiian was superior to the mentaiko & corn, which I think could have used some more corn. The remaining pizzas on the menu, clam and pepperoni, are perhaps less of a draw for me, but on the strength of the Hawaiian and overall texture and construction of this style of pizza I'm interested in returning here to try those as well. Restaurant volume was pretty reasonable; even with music playing in the background, I didn't have to speak with a raised voice and had no trouble hearing the rest of my party.",
