They have a nice system of table service or counter carryout, and I'm pretty sure they deliver but you have to check. My family likes to start with some chips and guac, but if you ask me that's just taking up room that could be filled with tacos. They're on the small side (street size) and you can order everything a la carte or as a dinner. For such a small space, they have a crazy selection of beers and pops. If you are up for another taste adventure, head across the street to Junebug Cafe for a chicory coffee and beignets for dessert.",

We were greeted by Alejandra who had a great attitude seating us, and I chose to sit with my friend in the left corner due to the amount of shade. Overall the environment I got from my first seating was great, but Im not sure I just got this sense that the tables weren\u2019t cleaned enough, so I just avoided it as much as i could. The menu seemed very organized and not cluttered which I was very fond of. Alot of choices to choose from, what I ended up ordering was a Classic Shrimp, The portage, and The Tux tacos. My god the Classic Shrimp was incredible, it was so good I had to order another one at the end of my meal. The Tux from my understanding of the image online it has two scallops not one, and the combination with the potato had an overwhelming flavor so I didn\u2019t really know what was going on. So I don\u2019t really recommend getting that one. The portage I was not expecting a whole jalape\u00f1o and that is awesome! The steak was tender and seasoning was perfect, I still ate it despite the heat factor it was expected. I loved it and will order it forsure next time. Presentation of each taco was fantastic, as you can see I took a picture for my instagram story. So I end this review on a good note. Believe the hype.",

I went in on a Tuesday, and tried their 3 taco special w/ rice & beans for $13.  The jibarito taco - a slice of steak on a plantain taco shell with lettuce, tomato, & garlic aioli. The chunk of steak looked big, and I was worried it would be chewy, but when I but in it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The flavor was on point, and I loved the plantain shell!  The chorizo con papas taco - 1st, the handmade tortillas they use are fantastic! They start with a generous layer of spicy chorizo, followed by their potato casserole, and finally sour cream. This is a delicious and hearty taco, for sure.  The sirena taco - Bacon wrapped shrimp with pickled red cabbage, Chile aioli, & Pico de gallo. A lot of the time when I have bacon wrapped shrimp, the bacon overpowers the shrimp. Not the case here. The ingredient ratio delivered the perfect flavor from all of the ingredients.  The interior is nice, and the staff was super helpful and courteous. I love the Frida mural out front! I can't wait to come back and try the other tacos, but next time I'll skip the rice & beans. They were good, but I'd rather save the stomach space for more tacos. They are also BYOB!",

My reason for giving three stars instead of five was out service. We were there at about 2:30pm so it wasn\u2019t busy. Three other tables were there and two were already eating. They had three servers and I counted 4 people in the kitchen. We both ordered the three taco dinner. Nothing complicated. It took 25 minutes for our order to come. 25 minutes. And our rice and beans were cold. I had to ask them to warm them up. It seemed very unorganized. The concept has changed. You no longer order at the counter, they have wait staff now which threw us off a bit. If the service wasn\u2019t so unorganized I would have given a five for sure!  UPDATE We gave this place another try and it was absolutely amazing. It\u2019s 1000% better than when we went last year, service wise. The food is fabulous and the servers were pleasant and had their act together. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! So I\u2019ve changed my review to five stars! My salad was sooo good also.",

We ordered over the phone and when I went to pick it up I saw the main/head cook and 2nd cook, the owner, the girl working at the front table and the older gentlemen helping out not wearing a mask.  Also the cooks weren\u2019t  wearing a hat. So I was skeptical from the start since every restaurant I\u2019ve been to the whole staff was wearing a mask during the covid-19 outbreak.  When I got home one of the first tacos we opened had a hair in it maybe because the cook wasn\u2019t wearing a hat and no one in the kitchen had a hat or hair net.  This doesn\u2019t make me question about how clean and sanitized the restaurant is because they just showed that they don\u2019t care about health cleanliness in their restaurant even during a pandemic.",

Horchata and cucumber lime agua fresca were tasty too. It was a busy weekend and the staff were doing their best to keep up. Cashiers were also waitstaff, bussers, etc. They were really hustling. Unique place that isn\u2019t your average taqueria, check it out.",

When we called the restaurant to tell them about the missing food the owner Marci  was extremely rude. And I'm quoting the owner Marci \"We gave the food to Grubhub. What do you want me to do about it. Grubhub will comp you.\" I work for customer service, you never ever tell a customer what do you want me to do about it. There's nothing that makes food taste worse then poor service. So if you want to have your order messed up and to be treated like garbage then by all means come to this restaurant.",

Kind of fast, but made to order, so sometimes it takes a little bit.  This is Not fine dining, it\u2019s casual- and I\u2019m wondering what kind of stellar service people get at other fast food taco places, because elsewhere I\u2019m lucky if I get a smile and a thank you. Tatas always smiles and thanks me and asks me if I need anything which is again WAAAAY more than I get elsewhere. The CORN tortillas are handmade from fresh masa.  You can see them making them- soooo I\u2019m confused about a review which is why I had to comment.  If you ask, they\u2019ll tell you the flour tortillas are delivered fresh every morning.  FYI, burritos come on a big FLOUR tortilla.  I\u2019ve had everything on the menu, and I have to remark, the Chile  rellenos are HUGE and won\u2019t fit in a taco, so they cut it in half.  It\u2019s really hearty and filling -actually one of my favs being an awesome vegetarian taco option.  Also,  I just returned from a trip to MX and I can\u2019t wait to get back in to Tatas because even in MX I couldn\u2019t find food as good as this.  I\u2019ve also seen comments about the cost of drinks- and guess what they\u2019re pretty much the same everywhere that serves bottles and higher quality food.  I even think the fast food place next door charges about 3 bucks for a fountain drink, so come on people....The $1.50 taco place is down the street....oh - and burritos do take a little longer - but do the math, they cook your food fresh every time. Other places give you god knows what meat that\u2019s been sitting around for the better portion of the day.  So I say keep on doing what you\u2019re doing Tatas and ignore the morons! I LOVE my food fresh without any junk.  No they\u2019re not typical - THANK GOD!!  Frankly, I think people are hypercritical because it\u2019s owned by a woman.  Maybe people don\u2019t expect a dude to mommy them when they go buy a taco.",

I ordered a burrito for carry out which by the way was good, no complaints about that and I waited for about 25 mins until I saw they were bringing the food of a party of 6 that ordered after me. Then, I got up and I went to the pick up side and I asked about my ordered, the nice lady who was taking care of the orders, taking them to the tables and cleaning them had it sitting there for I don\u2019t know how long and I asked her \u201cI thought you were going to call out my name\u201d since they asked for my name when I placed my order. The place is nice, they are friendly, they have board games to keep you entertained until your food arrives, fair prices. They only need to be more attentive overall, especially for the people that order carry out and call out their names. I would recommend it, and will be going back.",

It's a cute little restaurant that is kid friendly. We stuck with the specialty tacos like sirena which had bacon wrapped shrimp, the smoked hog with pork belly. My daughter had the plain Jane with chicken. Everything was delicious. It wasn't spicy and I think from the reviews that are a bit negative claiming food is bland (read from Yelp), I believe they were expecting spiciness. If I read correctly, they are still fairly new. They have potential to grow and build on their menu. I can see the possibility of them adding to their menu the ability to change the level of heat to accommodate those who want a stronger bolder flavor and still offer mild flavor for those who want a bit a spice. Also, torrejas for dessert was yummy and I look forward to having it again.",

I would definitely come back here, the food is so so good and flavorful. This is going to be one of my favorite spots for sure \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d the customer service is 100% , they are very friendly, welcoming and caring. We tried almost everything on the menu and loved it all. They care so much about customer satisfaction, they use recycled utensils and various different items. They have different recycling bins for the costumer to recycle \u267b\ufe0f and there are a couple of tables outside to have a nice date out with a significant other or your loved ones. They welcome dogs outside with snacks and water for them to hydrate if needed, it is a nice spot to stop by with your dog to take a little rest and relax. The inside of the restaurant offers nice big tables, plenty of sitting for a big family and the also have big lottery\u2019s cards for you to play after a good meal. We tried playing it while waiting for the food but it came out so quick that we couldn\u2019t start the game that\u2019s how quick the service is.. So I would say that\u2019s it is definitely a game to play after the wonderful food, and just hand out for a little bit. The decorations of the place makes it stand out from everything around it so much that you won\u2019t have trouble finding it, from the street block to the walls. Beautiful roses are painted on the pavement outside and the wall outside has a beautiful painting of Frida Kahlo which I thought it was very thoughtful and unique. The bathrooms are very very clean too!!",

Thr owner once said - it\u2019s kind of like a Panera set up....  (but not the food) The food quality is high and fresh to its not a typical fast taqueria.  Unlike other places - The meat isn\u2019t chopped to death so you don\u2019t see all the fat, and the guacamole is not mixed - I like it/ I like to see how much avocado I\u2019m getting and I like that there aren\u2019t fillers.

I should have walked out with my kids but decided to give them a chance. So after ordering a large crowd came in and they were served with iced water and they received their food first. We've now been waiting an hour and our part of our food came which the order was wrong and a steak taco consisted of a dry tortilla with a pathetic small piece of steak...at that point we were done and got my money back and left.
