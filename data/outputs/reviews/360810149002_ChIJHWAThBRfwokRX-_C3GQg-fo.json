They have really adorable paintings on the wall. The wait staff and service was great. I forgot the waitresses name but she was very attentive. My mother had a throat problem so she was looking for a room temperature ginger ale and the waitress came out asking if the ginger ale she has was good enough. It wasn\u2019t so the waitress went and warmed up the can and gave my mother the ginger ale can. Talk about going above and beyond!  Regarding the food, the food variety is unique and tastes great. Would highly recommend the Chingri fried rice dish - it consists of shrimp, beef AND chicken. Talk about a triple threat. The portion is good enough to feed two people I would say. The food also came out warm and didn\u2019t take too long to come.  Overall would rate 5/5. Come out and enjoy/support this small business restaurant! You wont regret it!",

Get there , we were checked in and temperature was taken. Tables were socially distanced. Place looked really nice had few tables seated in there. We started with the chingri appetizer combo which contained chicken lollipop, spring rolls and shrimp tempura. I was hoping the chicken lollipops would be more breaded but was still good. The Mocktails we ordered were Oasis and Paloma , they were excellent. Now to the main food , I had ordered the lamb chops they were cooked to perfection. Not many \"Desi\" restaurants know how to do that. My friend had ordered the Udon With Beef , she liked hers as well.  Also they brought out 2 desserts on the house !! We truly appreciated the gesture!!  Service- 10/10 Ambiance- 10/10 Parking - Street COVID 19 - Precautions were taken Outdoor Seating Available",

I order the pad kee maow where the noodles were made freshly. They provide good serving portions. The food is made in moderate time which allows time to enjoy their wonderful appetizers. The bathroom is very clean. Best of all, the food is halal! Amazing restaurant. I highly recommend. Located on the part of steinway thats not so hectic and busy.",

The sauces are very flavorful.  My only complaint was them forgetting my 2 Thai iced teas for one of my orders. I double checked with the man before leaving, and he told me everything was there. Yet, when I got home, the 2 Thai iced teas were missing, and we were disappointed. It's the best thing to accompany Thai food, and we weren't satisfied with our food because our drinks were missing. So please, take everything into account next time. Apart from this, I would definitely recommend this place.",

The mocktails were extremely sour so I had to keep asking for a change. The green curry was not my favorite. The rice were bland as well.

The reason why I give this place 3 stars is because I reordered the Chingri Appetizer Combo which I did indeed enjoy but that\u2019s it! The Chingri Special Fried Rice was disgusting!!! The rice was old, which I can tell because the rice was really stale and really dry. The vegetables were hard, so either they became stale or they weren\u2019t steamed long enough. To make it worse, there were eggshells in my food! I took a bite and the bite was crunchy, I immediately became grossed out and spit out an eggshell and found more egg shells in my food.  I\u2019m really disappointed because I had an excellent first experience and loved the food and I had a horrible second experience, which was the complete opposite of my wonderful first experience. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be reordering because it was a gross second experience!",

The Chicken Lollipop and fried homemade Momos were excellent. The spicy mayo will surprise you, it\u2019s not the typical sauce but even better with what appears to be a cumin masala blend. Sooo good. The fry on both appetizers was light and crispy.  We got the Chingri special fried rice and Chicken basil fried rice. I personally preferred the flavor of the basil fried rice but the chingri special fried rice has a variety of proteins. Both were cooked well. Portions are filling for one person. If I could add any feedback, I think it would be even better with some more heat/chili but of course that is up to your own taste.  Lastly,  we tried the fried ice cream. The crust was a bit hard but still tasted excellent. Would recommend to share this with someone as it is large!  They also served us a very nice Thai iced tea \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffdLight and not overly sweet.  Will definitely be coming back! \ud83d\ude0a",

For some reason, they couldn\u2019t find my reservation and told me I had to wait. They said they\u2019d give me a call when they have a table ready. 45 minutes pass and I don\u2019t get a call so me and my friends decide to walk back and the \u201chost\u201d sees us and sits us down. He says sorry for not calling. After we\u2019re seated, they took a really long time to give us menus, a really long time to take our order, and a really long time for appetizers and entrees to arrive. All in all really bad experience. I came here because muslimfoodies rated this place 9/10 but I will never listen to muslimfoodies ever again. It was not 9/10, it was just bad. The guy who was our waiter was so sarcastic, very rude, and had an attitude that made me even more mad. It took 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive and then an additional 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Another guy who seemed like the manager tried guilt tripping my table into eating a salad after we kindly requested that they take it away. My friend did not like the smell of the larb salad and was on the verge of throwing up, so we asked for them to take it away, he kept insisting that we keep it on the table. He guilt tripped us by saying \"if you don't eat it, we're just gonna throw it away and it\u2019ll get wasted so please just keep it.\" Very disgusting and unprofessional. This is the worst experience I've had in a restaurant ever. I understand you guys are new but if you keep doing things like this, I don't expect you guys to stay open much longer.",

I got the Sizzling Lamb Rack with medium sauce and the \u201cextra hot\u201d on the side. For a desi, the extra hot is 100% worth the try; not overbearingly spicy and quite flavorful! The lamb itself was perfectly cooked, not gamey and very filling when paired with the garlic rice, which was a first for me, a subtle hint of garlic in the rice made it a perfect pair.  I did try the chicken and beef sizzler from my colleagues, the meat was flavorful and tender - unfortunately they didn\u2019t share more for me to give a longer review on it hahaha.  The lollipop chicken and the sauce is by far the best I\u2019ve had; better than Sagar and Tangra - which are the only other places I\u2019ve had them.  I had the pleasure with speaking with Masood (forgive me if I spelled it wrong) one of the owners, very humble gentlemen.

We tried all  the mocktails from the menu and I personally liked Oasis.  For appetizers I would give them 5/5 .We tried 4 appetizers (Thai Satay, Chicken Lollypop, Shrimp Tempura, Homemade Momo) and all of them came out very good. Dipping sauces for appetizers tasted amazing.  Now come to the main dishes here I think  Pad Kee Maw will take me back to the restaurant again and again. Red curry and Fried rice are also up to the mark .We also had beef Manchurian, it was ok but could have been better. Portion for the Entr\u00e9es are good for 2 people.  We had  fried banana with ice -cream for dessert and it was great.",

The outdoor dining space was lovely; the ambiance created by the candles and flowers atop our tables provided a warm and welcoming environment. The food was incredible! As other reviews have mentioned, the Mango lassi is a MUST! Shrimp chow mein (I prefer my food spicy so the range of spice offered is extremely helpful) is UNFORGETTABLE - I am still thinking about it! The chicken lollipops, shrimp tempura, and spring rolls are the best appetizers/starters to a wonderful meal, however, there are a variety of appetizers that are offered. These are the appetizers I tasted as I ordered the appetizer combo. The desserts are also delicious, the restaurant staff was gracious enough to treat us to dessert on the house the day of our visit. This is a memory I will never forget and makes you want to return. I will certainly be back and am excited to try new dishes! Hope this Restaurant nothing but the best - Congratulations on the opening! I feel so grateful to have this new restaurant in town serving Zabiha certified Halal meat - not something you see often.",

        "caption": "this is a new Asian Fusion restaurant called Chingri that opened up in Astoria 8 days ago. Its 100% halal. For starters we got Momos and Spring Rolls. They were equally delicious. For drinks we had gotten mocktails. The Oasis and Mojito. Entrees were beef chow mein and chicken chow mein, beef and chicken pad thai, and chicken with broccoli, and thai green curry with coconut rice. Each dish was made to everyone\u2019s requested spice level and we were pleasantly surprised as to how amazing it all tasted. For dessert we got fried matcha ice cream and fried bananas with a scoop of matcha ice cream. Service was good and the employees were so kind and accommodating. Also, they have outdoor seating so it wasn\u2019t bad at all.  Overall, i\u2019d give this place a 10/10. Please check this place out! It\u2019s definitely worth all the hype! \ud83d\ude0d",
