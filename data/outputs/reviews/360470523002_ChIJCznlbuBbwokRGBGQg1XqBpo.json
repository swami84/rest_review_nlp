We started off with the Spicy Hibiscus Margarita ($14) and the Winter Tiki cocktail ($14). The spicy Hibiscus margarita was not my cup of tea: tasted a little like cough syrup,to be honest. The Winter Tiki though, was delicious. Served in a cute clear pineapple tiki glass, it was a perfectly refreshing cocktail of coconut tequila, pineapple and lime juice. For the tasting menu, we got the following items:. Guacamole,  snapper tempura fish tacos, spicy tuna tartare sopes, foie gras al pastor, hamachi sashimi, lamb chorizo meatballs,  heritage pork osso bucco, tres leches cake with coconut ice cream and churros with passionfruit and chocolate dipping sauces. We were absolutely stuffed afterwards. Highly recommend doing the tasting menu here!",

We arrived with no reservation on a Sat evening and didn't have to wait too long to be seated at the bar, which has ample space for having a several plates served at the same time.  Lovely ambience, slightly upscale without being overly ambitious. There is a wonderful energy throughout the restaurant, it's great for both small and large groups.  Innovative food and drinks. Love that they present it in a very humble manner. We had the deconstructed margarita, as well as a mezcal beverage, both were used cubes to start off the beverage alcohol-forward, which slowly melted to taste more flavorful.  We loved the foie gras el pastor, and the charred carrots.  I would definitely come back again.",

We started with some deconstructed drinks. This included frozen cocktail cubes that melted into your spirit of choice and CHANGED THE DRINK's pallet as dinner progressed. I had the Tea At Sunset in a giant 20 oz goblet and I tried the blueberry Pomegranate option. Both aren't even drinks. They are more like drinkable Art. Then came the buffalo elote. Not sure if that's a popular dish but it's brilliant. So close to eating a chicken wing due to corn core. The tostada was fresh and flavorful as well. The Goat Neck Barbacoa was a real treat. I'm talkin fall off the bone, shred with a spoon, PERFECTLY cooked and seasoned. The fresh tortilla and carefully selected toppings will have you reeling. We couldn't resist desert at that point so we chose the Blueberry Tres Leches and churros. And they did not disappoint. Tres Leches was delicious and airy and the churros may have been the best I've ever had. Crisp on the outside creamy on the inside with a delicious citrusy confit for dipping. Mark my words, I'll be back for a second and third visit. Wow!",

Wow, is the 1st thing out of my mouth. Everyone's mouth said wow and yum. We officially did not know what was coming out of the kitchen since we went with the tasting menu. Maybe theu should rename it to the menu full of taste?  We had Alex and Casey as our servers, Alex was doing the brunt of the service and Casey was his silent partner. They were also taking care of other tables as well. They must have put 100,000 steps during the time we spent.  You imagine as you are carrying 6 drinks on a tray and while you are serving them, others un your group are tugging on your clothes because they need drinks or because their delicious drinks are done, they are looking for more. Both Alex and Casey performed like pros in this manner.  We started with with some chios, unlike any chip yoh are used to, with an avocado type dip. The chio felt like a cross between potato and vegetable and the avocado had a seasoning better than regular guac. Next came the bone marrow and the homemade soft fluffy tortillas with additional flavors to add on the side. When the butter shrimp came out, they had me by the horns. The shrimp comes with these flavorful button mushrooms that melts in your mouth.  The flavors that come out from the butter shrimp is amazing. When you think you are impressed, something new comes out and impresses you even more. That was the fish tacos simply put. They are named Snapper tempura fish tacos with kimchee cabbage and habanero jam. I really recommend to look at the menu because there are so many fantastic choices. Then the roasted leek quesadilla came out. By this time your stomach is starting to stay STOP, but your olfactory system says MORE. The octopus with chirizo came after that and omg were so delicious. Unlike octopus anywhere else. The whole time you are eating, they are also serving their signature drinks which are numerous for this place. You can choose sangria, some delish beers and wines, but i recommend the deconstructed drinks consisting of an \"old fashioned\" flavored cube made of bitters, spices and citrus and add one of the huge selection of unheard of smooth mezcals and tequilas they offer.  They also have softer versions of other drinks as well. You will have a lot of choices. Finally, vanilla flan and the fresh made churros with chocolate and passionfruit dips to finish it off and send you home happy.",

Pour a generous shot of the tequila or mezcal of choice over the ice blocks and sip slowly while the ice melts.  I guess I'll have to come back to try everything on the menu. We went for the garlic shrimp (spectacularly laden with mushrooms), the grilled octopus (very nice kick to that one), and the Peking duck carnitas (served with tortillas, three kinds of dipping sauce, chopped garlic, and a nice corn salsa).",

Every time I've been here, I've ordered the chef selection, which is a multi-course sampling of various dishes on the menu. You give them your dietary restrictions, but the specific dishes they bring out is up to them.  Each time, they have proceeded to bring dish after dish of things I don't particularly like and would never order in any other restaurant. Ceviche, shrimp, octopus, bone marrow, goat neck, foie gras, steak tartare, flan, etc. And each time, I was blown away with how good it was.  The tasting menu runs about $55 a person. I typically dine by myself, and the portion sizes are absolutely massive. Two, maybe three people could easily be satisfied with what I was served.  The service is excellent, the atmosphere is great. It really is that good.",

Xixa was a really pleasant surprise. Traif was too busy so we went here and the food was excellent. It's Mexican-ish with the same taste first, creativity second execution that I've come to love at traif. I always find great flavor combinations that delight and inspiration in their food.  I'm totally stealing the idea of elotes carrots and serving them at my next dinner party. Love the buffalo style corn elotes which totally worked, too!  I'm pretty sure I'm still thinking about the garlic butter shrimp risotto.  The large-format plates were very generous. We have the giant short ribs which was a bargain at the price. We had to bring it home with us.  The people next to us had the duck as part of the tasting menu which is a bargain at $55 per person. There was a half a duck and they took the rest of it home.  The bartenders were really friendly and the cocktails were balanced and a little too easy to drink. I will definitely not wait so long to eat there again.",

Idea is really good, it's novel but the drinks tasted okay. Tacos were scrumptious. Lamb filling in the tacos was really good. The meat was perfectly cooked through and had all the flavors in the right amount. Guacamole was refreshing but the chips could have been better. The idea of having an assortment of chips is nice, however, not all of the chips were good. I would still prefer guac with just corn chips! Churros was a great disappointment. They were burnt,  had totally lost their shape and did not look appetizing at all. All in all, we had a good dining experience! I would love to visit this restaurant again!",

When we arrived at Xixa, we were wondering \u201cis this the place?\u201d There was no fancy, glamorous sign outside, well, not much of anything outside. Just a little \u201cXixa\u201d painted on a wall, close to the ground. But with just one step inside, we were transported into this gorgeous, modern, lovely restaurant! There was no way to know or imagine that this beautiful space exist from just looking at the restaurant from the outside.  At the first glance, The restaurant doesn\u2019t look that big. Just a long bar and a communal table. But the long restaurant kept on going. They had more tables after the bar and communal table, both booth and table seating.  The chef Jason Marcus told us how he fell in love with Mexican food during his visits to Mexico. He brings out his creation of Mexican-inspired dishes. We got to try so many of wonderful, creative, tasty creations such as Breakfast Tacos, Baked Poulet Rouge Chicken & Mojo Verde Albondigas, Chilaquiles, Corn & Buttermilk Baked Pancake, and more!  All of the items were tasty, and I liked the innovative, upscale Mexican dishes. The chef was very personable and funny, and I could tell he had passion for Mexican food and coming up with his own creations. The staffs were nice and efficient, it was really fun! I love finding a new, great restaurant while socializing, sharing plates with each other like a good ol\u2019 friends. I would love to go back to Xixa for their regular menus.

        "caption": "It's difficult to review Xixa without comparing it to its sister restaurant, Traif. Similar to its sibling, Xixa offers a difficult-to-categorize cuisine, but one that pulls inspiration from Mexican techniques and ingredients. In addition to having an intriguing drink and food menu, Xixa offers a tasting menu at $40 for parties of four or more, a dining option that should definitely be taken advantage of. The dishes rotate regularly, but from the meal we had here, the standout dishes were: - Skirt Steak: Cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a side of red onions and corn, it was the romesco sauce that really brought out the flavor of this dish. - Brussel Sprouts: These are quite possibly the most delicious brussel sprouts I have yet to taste in NYC. They're doused in a spicy-sweet vin, lightly fried, and mixed with strawberries, currants, and sunflower seeds. They're crisp but not too crunchy, covering the spectrum of spicy to salty to sweet, and disappeared within seconds from our table. - Foie Gras Al Pastor: This was the first time I tried foie gras paired with fruit, and it was a combination that worked startlingly well. The foie gras is perfectly seared and tender, and the sweetness from the pineapple and torrejas (a Mexican version of the traditional French Toast) adds even more richness and dimension to each bite. - Churros: Served as the dessert at the end of our meal, they're warm, crisp on the outside, yet still somewhat doughy in the center. The best part was digging into the raspberry sorbet it came with and realizing that it had been made with a healthy dose of chilies in the mix as well.  Call in advance for reservations and make sure to come with at least three others to take advantage of the tasting menu.",

The killer item though was the carne asada Korean short ribs with bulgur poblano tomato salad that rounded out the meal nicely (expect to order between 4-6 plates to be full). Finish off with the salty churros, passion fruit and jalape\u00f1o sorbet and you won't regret coming here.
