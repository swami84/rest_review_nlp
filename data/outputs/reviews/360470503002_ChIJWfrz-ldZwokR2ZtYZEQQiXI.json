However, considering we both had steak  slipped in to our food against us knowing it didn't seem like to much to expect. They only refunded the burrito.

From the flavor palette to the portion sizes and prices the place was a huge disappointment to our group which consisted of people of multiple ethnicities, including Hispanic. The nachos we paid $12 had hardly any chips, not enough cheese and too many heavy toppings that made them purely soggy when brought to the table. We also ordered chips and salsa which were way less than expected for price. The flavor palette wasn\u2019t savory enough; the mole being much too sweet and off flavored. The quesadilla had an unenjoyable flavor to it. The type of cheese or something they\u2019re using is just not good. Ended up paying $60 for a meal none of us enjoyed nor were fullfilled by. However the staff was friendly!",

As I walked by last night, I saw the sign on the sidewalk listing some food. I went inside and asked what it was. I chose to try the Mexican Shrimp Primavera, is a pasta with grilled vegetables. This special is only served till Sunday.  From experience restaurants with changing menu create delicious meals.  The pasta was excellent, right on the spot with a different flavor and lots of extra sauce in it. The sauce was amazing, it had that spicy hot flavor from the Mexican hot green peppers, first time I had pasta with hot green peppers in it, it tasted good ! The only thing that was missing in the dish was a side of roasted bread, they don't even make garlic bread here. I asked for the dish to be served in a to go dish, I thought I wasn't gonna eat it all, surprise to me, the dish was soooooo frEkEn good, that I had to eat it all.  I had the Chicharron Tacos and it was also sooo delicious a seasonal item.  This restaurant is well worthy checking out weekly because the changing menu dishes are Awesome ! ...  People with dogs can come eat and sit on the sidewalk tables with their dogs, that is kool !",

        "caption": "Don't do it.  I waited 20 minutes for a $12 burrito despite my being one of just three customers total in the dining room, and being able to see at least five cooks chatting it up behind the line.  Burrito ended up being mediocre and not filling.  Their tomatillo salsa runs like water.  Coffee was instant, chalky, and served with a spoon already in the mug. Mug had a jalape\u00f1o seed stuck to it, by the way.  Discovered the joint was cash only only as I was paying. Now, I remarked about this, but was shown that they do have a \"cash only\" sign posted, however it's 8 feet off the ground. Even as a relatively tall person (6 feet or so), this sign did not fall--even remotely--into the category of things one might consider at-eye-level. Beyond that, the sign is posted apart from all other signage in the window. So on top of returning to work late, and feeling compelled to take the time and focus away from my work required to draft this review, I also paid an ATM fee.  Napkin was rough and not absorbent.  Table wabbled.  Server's cologne permeated my nostrils, and I can still smell it in the fabric of my clothing.  Server dipped the water pitcher into my glass while refilling--I'm a little concerned I may contract an illness.  I almost knocked over a decorative bottle of Jarritos that was precariously placed right behind my head--could've been a disaster considering I brought no change of clothes with me on this particular burrito run.  The bench I was sitting on was actually a storage object, and when I stood up, the seat/lid caught on the fabric of my pants and made and alarming clapping sound as it fell shut.  Also there were a few huge flies buzzing around the entire time.  *Two somewhat redeeming (?) things: one of the songs on their playlist contained a jazz guitar solo, and I do appreciate that they use 12-sided, heavy glasses for water.",

Looked through the menu, waited another 10 before we started thinking no one has came to even offer us water! We were there for a total of 20 minutes before we decided to go and the only reason we stood was to prove a point of how useless the staff is. Best of all when we were making our way to the door not one person from the staff asked us why we were leaving...ABSOLUTELY NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!!!! That is definitely the last time I consider spending money there...any restuarant in the neighborhood is friendlier and more then happy for you to spend your money and time there",

Not sure if they have margaritas yet, but there is beer. Space is tiny and not so exciting (but not too grungey or anything).",
