Then we ordered the Mexican breakfast torta which was good, the omelets which was also good, the chocolate chip cornmeal pancakes I didn't like them at all but the others did and, the French toast because it had orange juice marinated bananas, but they didn't come with it and when we asked the server they didn't know that it came with them and then came back to tell us they ran out. It bothered us a lot that we had to inquire and that they didn't notify us and honestly the French toast looked pretty pathetic and the cherries they were talking about were marichino not real cherries lol.
