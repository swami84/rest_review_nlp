THIS place has delicious food, AND they package it in a way we can still enjoy the food at home. They have flavorful crispy spring rolls, a decadent and savory pad woon sen, and many other delightful dishes!  THANK YOU to Olay's Thai Lao for making fantastic food to go!",

It took over an hour and then, the curry was wrong. I wasn't going to call because they didn't sound too excited when I first called, but I'm glad I did. They immediately offered to bring out another order, which turned out to be delicious as were my other dishes. And the best mango sticky rice I've come across on the island. Thank you! Can't wait to try again.",

I ordered the Pad Prik Khing Lao hot and it was phenomenal.  The keffir was prominent in the rich deeply flavorful sauce and the heat level was what I'd get asking for hot in Thailand.  Typically I'm having to add a significant amount of extra ground chili to bring a dish up to an appropriate heat level.  My girlfriend got the pineapple fried rice mild and was very satisfied.  She's not very heat tolerant, so they stick to their heat scale well.  The ambience is also very nice - doesn't look like much when you walk in the front, but the outside area is great.  I sadly forgot to take a picture of the food before wolfing it down.",
