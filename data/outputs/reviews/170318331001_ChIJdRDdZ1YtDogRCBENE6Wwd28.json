This was an exceptional value, especially for the Fulton Market neighborhood. We did look over the regular menu and there were still prices on the menu that would work into anyone's budget, but the Valentine's Day deal was exceptional.  So, when you get a deal like that you expect the food to be just ok, right? Well, that was not the case. The food was delicious. We had NY Strip and Salmon. The portions were adult sizes also. BTW, the crab cakes were huge and they were delicious. I could have made a meal out of the crab cakes alone. They really take pride in their food and must have a chef that cares. We were very pleased with our experience.  The atmosphere at this place is warm and cozy. This is definitely on our list of place to eat in our neighborhood.  #LetsGuide #FultonMarket #Chicago #BestOf #Food",

Was the last day of Restaurant Week and caught their RW Brunch, which was a very generous deal: fat hot cinnamon roll, two pancake/waffle plates, and two entrees for 24$. These cinnamon rolls put all cinnamon rolls to shame - perfectly hot, oozing with icing and drizzled with caramel. The waffles were good too, and the skillets can definitely fill you up for the rest of the day. Black Barrel's food is worth a visit, just be patient with their front of house (and maybe have your waitress repeat your orders back to you). They're usually pretty good about fixing a mistake.",
