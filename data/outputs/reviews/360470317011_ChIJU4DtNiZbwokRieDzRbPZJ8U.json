Upon walking into the restaurant I saw three grown men lying in the dining room on the banquettes, covered up in blankets and not wearing masks. TF is that about?! Then two dudes walk out of the kitchen also not wearing masks. The only guy wearing a mask was the one who went to grab my order. I wanted to ask what in god\u2019s name was going on but didn\u2019t want to be exposed to what looked like potentially sick people any longer than I already had. I\u2019ve ordered delivery from here numerous time and love their food but I completely lost my appetite after that experience. There are way too many restaurants who are struggling to stay open and actually care about keeping their community healthy by following covid-safe protocol. Dhania is not one of them.",

The most disappointing thing was the Garlic Naan - dry, no butter or fresh herbs - just garlic from the jar. And they give you one for 3.50. Smoky chicken wings had more color than flavor. Alu tikki and fish pepper fry were alright but again very mild in flavor. I wouldn\u2019t recommend. Unwanted leftovers.",

Next, the food itself- we ordered a couple of different kinds of dishes. The flavor ranged from decently good to inarguably tasty. The atmosphere was alright, it was definitely a clean restaurant though.  Bottom line: The people were warm and hospitable and the food was good. I'm pretty sure you won't be able to find a better spot for Indian food in the neighborhood.",
