The one in New York attracts a line that snakes around the park at lunch time and I've had to wait up to 1.5 hours in line at times and never complained because at the end, I'd get a lunch that is truly delicious, healthy and environmentally friendly (plant based). I think Ganesh Dosa deserves a line that snakes around the Kaka'ako shopping center and out of the door and around the building. My wife, my son and I eat it every time we're in the area and I think more people should too. Thank you guys for offering this amazing delicacy to us! We wish you a long and prosperous endeavor.",

I got the Chef\u2019s Recommendation that was a dosa crepe filled with potato, kalamata olives, tomato, avocado, and jarlsberg cheese, with a side of coconut chutney. WOW, scrumptious! What\u2019s more is that the dish is quite healthy with the dosa being made from fermented rice and lentils- SUPER good for your gut microbiome and so tasty. I had been craving pizza, however this dosa more than satisfied my pizza craving and with a lot less fat and calories. The portion was huge too and I couldn\u2019t finish it, so if you\u2019re a big eater, it will be plenty. My favorite part was the thin crepe edges, so crispy and yummy. The seasonings were perfect, not too subtle, not overpowering.  Note to owner: You may want to consider opening a shop in Kailua near the Target store in a very visible area, your business will go crazy. You really cook an amazing product. Kailua is consumerville and you are kinda hidden in the Ohana Marketplace.",
