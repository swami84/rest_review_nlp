If you are a fan of really good inventive, fresh food, well prepared, you need to eat at Long Nine.  First impression on walking in made us pause-it ain't fancy. But after looking at selections on the menu wall, we had to order. Delicious slow cooked pulled pork with a peach bbq sauce over creamy mac cheese. Heavenly. Cuban panini with house made fresh pickles. Yummy. The little green salad on each plate was dressed with something something so good I wanted more.  The housemade bread is wonderful, with a slight sweetness and tastiness that is a perfect compliment to the homey but elevated fare.  The staff was friendly, accommodating, and professional.  Good people who know what they're doing in the front of the house and the back.  If I lived in Springfield I'd eat at Long Nine often.",

I ordered the French dip which I thought was impossible to do wrong only to be unpleasantly surprised. This was the blandest French dip I have ever been served in my life, devoid of flavor, salt and on par with boiled chicken. The only compliment I can give on the food is the ingredients are high quality, the execution besides looking good is completely lack luster.the bread is fresh baked and delicious.  They have a whole hipster aesthetic going on, serving food on metal trays and drinks in Mason jars (yawn, when is this trend going to end, it is so overdone and common feeling), yet they are lazy about it and tone deaf to efforts to support Illinois businesses. They are serving Boylan BottlingNew Jersey bottled soda in the state capital of Illinois, when Excel Bottling is about 1.5 hours away in Southern Illinois. Even in Missouri they serve Excel, supporting local companies (they forced me to  compliment Missouri, which is another low for the day).  I cannot see any justification for going here at lunch unless it is winter and you are desperate for a hot sandwich within walking distance. Even still you can get a toasted sandwich at Head West and and cold sandwich at Jimmy John's long standing Illinois companies that at least have flavor to their food.  Also the staff while not rude are not friendly at all.  TLDR; paid $10 for French dip with zero seasoning.",

My husband was walking by when it happened a was hit by the bench on his wrist while it was coming up.  This caused severe pain, swelling and bruising to his hand, much less the distress felt by the young lady on the floor.  There are no stable chairs within the premises, only benches which are precarious at best.  The available seating is not suitable for a full grown mature adult or senior citizen.  After consulting with the owner about what happened, she was flippant and argumentative and was rather proud of their seating design, and had no intentions of modifying anything.  I would not recommend trying to sit in the premises; however, the food was flavorful, albeit overpriced.",

I ordered the balsamic and blue sandwich with a cup of tomato bisque soup.  Food promptly came out of the kitchen and was served hot and fresh. The only complaint I could even find was that some parts of my pork belly were harder to chew but for the most part it was tender and delicious. The soup was fantastic as well.  I recommend this for a quick bite to eat but it can get cramped inside. If you're looking for a quick lunch and are in the area this has got to be one of the best places to go.",

I had the Cubano sandwich with chips and their bottled soda \u2013 delicious. Definitely, worth a stop by, but only for lunch as they are only open from 11am-3pm.",

The menu is on the wall, when you walk in: appetizers, sandwiches, soups, & entrees. You order, at counter, then your meal is brought to your table. We ordered the mixed cheese grilled cheese sandwich (soooo yummy!!!), on homemade garlic bread. All sandwich platters come with bagged chips but, for $3, you can change them out for a specialty side, which is what we did. My husband got their mac & cheese side and liked it. I got the cilantro rice. It was good but I was sorry I got it because the sandwiches are pretty darn big and I was full after eating mine! All of their bread is homemade and I noticed several people had soup with one of the giant rolls and it looked fantastic! If I was to go back, that\u2019s what I\u2019d order, although I\u2019d miss that grilled cheese. On second thought, my hubby & I could both get the soup & roll, then split the grilled cheese! For drinks, they\u2019ve got some old fashioned bottled sodas, as well as tea, lemon water, etc. We also got their homemade peanut butter cookies. I\u2019ll just say you\u2019ve GOT to have them! A pleasant & pleasing place to eat!!!",
