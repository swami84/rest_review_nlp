The blackened chicken sandwich wasn\u2019t really blackened at all; the fries were great, cream of cauliflower soup was excellent, and the artisanal salad was great. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t matter, the service was terrible. It took almost an hour to get our food. Our sever disappeared in the middle of the meal, he didn\u2019t deliver our drinks or the main course, and we had to go out of our way to order desert. I think we held up our end of the bargain; this restaurant did not. I wouldn\u2019t go back, you only get one first impression.",
