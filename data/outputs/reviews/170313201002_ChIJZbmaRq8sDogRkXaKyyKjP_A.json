Ordered one today and it was the biggest waste of money I've spent on a meal in a long time. Sandwich took maybe four bites to eat and left me still wanting more and the pickle was very sad; about the thinnest I've ever seen. To top it off it was $6.25 or so after taxes. It's pretty insulting to get such a terribly overpriced and underwhelming sandwich when right across the way you can get a McChicken for $1.00 and receive a more fulfilling meal. Just disappointed in how my last few experiences here have turned out.",

I went back to the ordering line and asked if it was more based on the sandwich you get.  She said no and then the guy ringing up yelled across to me \"SWEETIE I ASKED YOU IF YOU WANTED THE DEAL!\".  First of all, nobody should ever be yelling at me from across the room.  Second, clearly i was confused...I didn't realize that i would be charged $1 more if I didn't take the damn pop.  So how about you explain that to me...I didn't want the pop, but I could have just taken it and given it to someone else vs being charged more.  MOST places will take $0.30-$0.40 cents off...but whatever.  Also, I find it a little unnerving to call all female patrons sweetie.  You are not my family, friend, or even an acquaintance.",
