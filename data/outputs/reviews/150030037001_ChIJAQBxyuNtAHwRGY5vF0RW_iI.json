The burger I had was way too salty for my taste, might be fine for others or it could have been just my burger. Personally,  I prefer Teddys- when I want to spend a lot- so not often or Burger King if I was doing fast food-I like their grilled flavor.",

You can order to-go or you can eat there as they have outdoor open seating. Credit cards are accepted and they're open 10:30-9pm daily. I recommend the Ten Gallon burger (Bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese) or the El Rey (pepper jack, avacado, panko crusted onion rings, and ranch sauce). All burgers use local grass-fed beef and is served on a house made potato pun. There's also amazing fries to choose from too. Overall, you'll be glad you ate here. Just remember, for a couple bucks more you can get the \"fancier\" burgers and it's totally worth it!",

This so far has been the exception, decent prices (especially compared to some other popular burger options with far higher prices and lesser quality) and quality/taste. The truck is a 3-5 minute walk from the Consolidated Ward Theatre, so if the small shopping plaza doesn\u2019t have a parking spot easy to park in the garage and take a very short straight walk over, very nice before or after a movie (glad I decided to see what was close after walking out of theatre). Definitely my now go to for burgers unless I find something better!  *Edit* Lowered rating due to having been there more than once now, not sure what happened as the first visit everything was amazing and the subsequent visits it\u2019s never been the same as first, taste and texture of burgers not same or anywhere near as good as first visit, don\u2019t know if they permanently changed something or just caught them on a good night the first time and that was not the norm, will be continuing search for a reliably good burger place as this hasn\u2019t panned out after multiple tries",

There's a bit of outdoor seating that is limited to a handful of small round tables and then two long tables combined. Some of which is under the shade of a tree. The food was excellent and fresh. The burger was cooked perfectly, not over or under done, and the fries were crisp and seasoned. They were not cooked to the point of being crunchy.",

Charged me 1$ for 1 slice of tomato.. Fix your customer relations and you should be getting 5 stars every time.",

It\u2019s delicious and I love myself a good food truck, but Google says it\u2019s between Starbucks and Wahoo and the South Shore Market map (in the TJ Maxx/Pier 1/Nordstrom Rack area) says it\u2019s over there with the other food places. But it\u2019s in the parking lot of Starbucks and Wahoo if you\u2019re looking for it. The burger El Ray (I think) was delicious. My new favorite burger and burger place! Sooooo good. The fries leave something to be desired, but the burger is amazing. I don\u2019t like mayo/aioli and forgot to ask for the burger without but I ate the entire thing, mayo and all. So definitely worth checking out!! I\u2019ll be back!",
