First thing to say is that each item is priced very reasonable to size and that my wife and i revisited the menu 3 times during dinner ordering at least 15 items. Each item whether entree or side was perfection both in taste and preparation. Sadly the Wagyu was not available due to imports from Japan being limited. There were also a couple options being sold out as it was later in the evening. We did thoroughly enjoy the chicken thighs and the corn the most but again hard choice to name. We also had the japanese cocktails with mint lemon and honey...so refreshing! I cant say enough. Service and food were hands down top notch. Thank you for the experience!",

Clean industrial design in historic Chinatown, Chk, chk, chk... and graceful Japanese service to sublimely compliment it all!  Stars of the evening? Any chicken skewer. Well for yakitori that says it all. But wow, get the tomato medley. A ice plate of ugly tomatoes! Get the beef sukiyaki skewer, yowzah, like a entire pot of sukiyaki (with enoki and mizuna) comes with a fresh (look at the height of the yolk) yolk. And I think a edamame kushikatsu? The final Joy is the chicken Ramen. How many chickens gave their life and bones to make that broth must be legions....  Hottest new Japanese restaurant in town.",

Skewers are seasoned with salt before going on the grill and nothing else which brings out the true flavor of the meat. The shrimp skewer can be eaten whole, every part is delicious.

Looking at other evaluations, there are criticisms such as high price, paid green tea, and it takes time to come out, but that is because it is based on the ordinary yakitori restaurant like a Japanese izakaya. Hmm.  The shop that the general aims at here is the same as the sushi show. We are trying to provide real satisfaction. The atmosphere and service of the restaurant is excellent, and it is a unique Hawaiian yakitori restaurant not found in Japan. More than half of our customers are locals. I am enjoying dinner without any premise image.  I will visit you again. Delicious, the best!  The last photo is a special chicken ramen. But it's not chicken ramen. A ramen made from chicken soup stock. I recommend it.

        "caption": "A MUST VISIT! Premium Yakitori Joint! You wont be disappointed. Ok so let me get this review started.  Location: As you all may know downtown is started to get really hip and revitalized with new shops and a much safer and cleaner area, but one thing that will never change is the difficulties in finding parking. Luckily this place is more of a place to go at night which is perfect because street parking is usually free but you'll be stuck finding spots, may the street parking gods be ever in your favor, otherwise UBER or LYFT \"support local side job workers\" (Better option if you're going to drink)  Atmosphere: I love how the restaurant was set up and designed, it has that warm ambience and gives you a sense of being in a casual yet classy as if you were in Japan feeling, again it's not like Yakitori Glad or the ones in Japan that has the same vibe as yakitori but this type of yakitori restaurant seems to mimic Tsukuneya kinda vibe but more open seating rather than being enclosed in pods. I love how they don't use electric type grilling from the looks of it it seemed more of actual charcoal grilling couldn't really tell, but you can really tell the difference in the cooking of the skewers.  Food: (The important part most people will read) (Cabbage w/sesame oil is included free/unlimited) So to clear up a few things, unlike Yakitori Glad where you get two skewers for $3.90 you only get one skewer per order which is priced at $2.80 or more (at current January 2017 prices) here. Now that's cleared let's get to whats good. So I and my friend basically ordered one of everything, didn't take a few photos in the beginning because totally forgot and just wanted to have it get in my belly, but these were a few that's worth trying and a MUST TRY:  Hachibei Foie Gras (Chicken Liver): So buttery and creamy, one order is not enough  Enoki Maki!! Mushroom is so good!! It also has a quail egg!  Sunazuri (Chicken Gizzard): A favorite of mine from Yakitori GLAD, and same here, the only difference is that here the gizzard is cooked perfectly and not chewy/rubbery as it often was in GLAD.  Shiso Maki (Perilla Leaves): So good Just try it!. The perilla leaves really have a strong flavor but it works so well.  Bacon & Egg Maki: TRY THIS! its so good, the egg is so good the right amount of sweetness and saltiness from the bacon completes it. Was really good I ordered another one.  Sukiyaki: This was really good! they include an egg yolk for you to dip the skewers, it just works! I had extra yolk so I dipped other skewers in it. Order THIS! -You can also just order the yolk by itself  Tsukune: A staple at any yakitori place, try dipping this in the yolk that comes with the sukiyaki!  Butabara (pork belly): Just order it so good Tara Bara: Same pork belly but this has the tare sauce which is the sweet shoyu sauce  Teba Shio (Chicken Wing): It comes with two wings, it's really moist and crisp, the way its grilled brings out the flavor.  Other things we ordered but was so so..  Mune (Chicken Breast): As with chicken breasts its dry, got the Mantai Mayo, and Wasabi shoyu. The wasabi shoyu flavor wasn't that strong like barely can taste and the mantai mayo was just a few dots of mayo, so wasn't really anything special.  Goma Salmon: Basically salmon poke like the one you get at foodland, I'm not sure if it was just the batch we got, but the salmon was fishy and I know what you're saying, \"salmon is a fish\" but if you know fishy fish you know what I mean, but it's good, but for the price I rather get the yakitori stuff.  Hachibei Goma Pudding: It's good, just try it there is a very strong smoky sesame taste, but it was interesting  Gelato Vanilla Azuki: Wished they added some kind of mochi ball on the side or something, it was pretty basic dessert.  Customer Service: Customer service was great! The workers were really nice and attentive, they were friendly and the owners like Robert were very welcoming and personable. No questions about service because they are excellent, which is what makes a restaurant just as great.",

        "caption": "For the price and for the service, not worth coming as a native Japanese girl\u2019s opinion. Although my first-timer partner to Yakitori loved the place, I had some problems with how Y.H tries to represent itself as a fancy and trendy restaurant in downtown, which is not a typical concept of Yakitori place is in Japan at all for the most part. So many Japanese places in Hawaii (e.g Ramen) are overpriced and fantasized, and Y.H is definitely one of them.  But ok, I understand if you want to make Yakitori place that is high-end and perfect-for-date restaurant, but then you must train servers with the minimum level of customer service! Our young male server\u2019s reminded me of an impersonal non-friendly cashier at a school cafeteria. In other words, he doesn\u2019t even try to be nice or hospitable to our table. Take order, bring food, that\u2019s it, no other elements of customer service. In fact, when I asked him something he usually just nod and turn around, he never once saw my eyes. He wasn\u2019t horrible, but for what you pay for your food, you can\u2019t even expect the standard pleasant service? Other servers seemed very nice, so maybe we were out of luck.  Quality of food is decent, but which is also relative to what you pay for. Some Happy Hour items were just jokes, because it\u2019s all $5 you get a tiny drop of p\u00e2t\u00e9??? Oh come on. Also we had two different kinds of chuhai, and they are like mock-tail and I could never figure if it has alcohol in it. All dishes come in the size that is smaller than you expect (Also smaller by the standard of Yakitori place in Japan). My love and hate dish of the night was Endoumame no kushiage, which is filled with wonderful pea\u2019s flavor and texture, yet comes in a size of (smaller than) marshmallow and $3.80. Shime\u2019s dishes Oyako-don and Ramen were average. In Yakitori place in Japan, the purpose of shime dishes (end of the meal entry with curb) are to finish meals strong, and they usually condense overwhelmingly rich chicken flavor in broth or with rice, which speaks of the pride of the restaurant. Ramen and Oyako-don missed the special flavors of having them at Yakitori place. The latter had tiniest pieces of chicken I\u2019ve ever seen in Oyako-don.  It was also clear that this place is for Japanese community and Japanese business customers. The owner was present at the restaurant for the entire time when we dined in (I\u2019ve seen him featured in an online article), but he was too busy to be a host of Japanese party of six. Even before the group came, he never checked tables or greet customers, never asked how\u2019s everything going except for his favorite friends\u2019 table. The same thing when you leave the restaurant, this place doesn\u2019t care if you had good time with your meals. I\u2019ve been a host and a server in Japanese restaurants in South Cal and Tokyo, and it\u2019s unimaginable that the owner never say Arigato gozaimashita (thank you for coming in) when customers leave. It feels like that many non-Japanese reviews giving 5 starts to this place don\u2019t know what\u2019s authentic yakitori is, poor thing...",

You can choose oyster rice bowl and ramen of yakitori course, but both were chosen by two people ... Unfortunately, I don't think it's a oyakodon served by a yakitori restaurant ... Ramen is an instant ramen level. In addition, we are surprised at accounting finally! Stop drinking and have some tea ... you get $ 3.80 a cup ... it was the first in the United States at a Japanese restaurant! Impossible ... How about it instead? That's why there was an alternative tea fee, and it was just $ 16 for ordinary green tea. Service too bad! Never go again! There are other good yakitori shops in Hawaii.
