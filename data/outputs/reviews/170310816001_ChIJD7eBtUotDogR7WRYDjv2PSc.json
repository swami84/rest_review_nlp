The two dishes were not red curry, no pineapple , no lemon. It tasted almost like a panang curry.  It had peanuts in it which is not even in description of red curry. We have pictures.We drove from the burbs to pick it up and are extremly dissappointed. The person that picked up the phone said thank you for your feedback and hung up. No resolution. What a waste of time and money . Horrible service for loyal customers  Update: Manger called back same day and apologized and took care of the entire bill as well.  Hope we get to try the correct Red Curry Dish when back in the city.  The Garlic Noodle's are quite delicious, so willing to give the 5 stars for a prompt resolution and quality food of LEYE that I am used to.  Thank you",

Besides that the other entree that My boyfriend ordered, Chicken Miso, was an appallingly small portion size. Besides this the precious time I ordered the Shrimp scurry was wrong and had giant noodles in it which is not what I ordered. Needless to say I\u2019ll never be ordering from this place again, and will think twice when ordering from another LEYE restaurant in the future.",
