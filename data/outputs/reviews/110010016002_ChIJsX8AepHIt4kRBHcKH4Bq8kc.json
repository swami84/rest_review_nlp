We are both from Trinidad and Tobago and when he realized this he asked me what part of Trinidad I am from. I told him Diego Martin. His response was, \"people like you does be from Laventille and like to say you come from Diego\". There are several issues with this because what is he connoting about people from Laventille? Laventille is many times only seen as a high crime area with residence mainly of the Afro ethnicity. I was totally taken aback to face this prejudice in America from another Trinidadian. This Indo Trinidadiain owner was looking at my \"Afro-ness\" and determining that I can only be from Laventille even though Afro-Trinidadians are about half the population of Trinidad and Tobago and that means the chances would be that I can be from any part of the country. He was prejudice towards me with underlying racism and he was prejudice to the people of Laventille. He should know his facts and history that many great things come from that community and it is people like him who continue to perpetuate divisiveness and racism in sweet T&T. I will never buy there again. I wish I could have given a negative star for his service.",

To top it off a chicken roti and sorrel cost me 22 dollars. The sorrel was just as bad. Don't bother find another place to try. I should have known not to have purchased after I asked the lady if everything was ready now and she said yes. Then after I paid she said it will be like 10 minutes. I threw the entire dish in the garbage as you can see from my pictures.",

It was both of our first time going and my boyfriend's first time having Roti. Unfortunately, I truly regret ever going to this restaurant. Not only was the goat extreme hard but the Curry Goat tasted a bit sour. My boyfriend had literally one bite and I had at least four when we both realized that this Curry Goat could not have been made that same day and tasted bad. That night and the next two days we have felt extremely sick. I contacted the manager David two times to inform him of experience, not for a reimbursement but to explain to him that we got extremely sick after going to his restaurant. On the second try I was able to get in contact with him but kept repeating that they have been open for twenty-five years and they have the softest goat in the city. He then suggested that perhaps we might have order beef(but we paid for Goat). I politely repeated to inform him of our experience and how despite his opinion our goat was extremely hard almost like jerky. Let me tell you, I am 100% caribbean and I know what goat taste like and I have prepared goat more times than one could cook. In my opinion I truly believe the Curry Goat was a day or two old and that is the reason we got sick afterwards. If I could give a worse rating than what I did, I definitely would. Not only was this meal extremely disappointing, we ultimately have sick for three days and I truly regret ever going to this restaurant. Spare yourself the chances of getting ill and look for another restaurant.",

I believe these people buy their Roti from the local market and put it in their shop it's not fresh!!! I use to go to this Caribbean local market and buy the frozen Roti and warm it. Funny enough, it tastes just like the Roti at Teddy's Roti shop. Also, I ordered goat meat and rice and peas. Didn't taste good at all. It wasn't fresh it tasted like they got cooked meat from the freezer and warmed it with water and curry powder. The rice and peas had a weird taste. To round everything up, the food was OVERPRICED!!! At first, I wanted to go to this other carribean spot their food is good and prices are very reasonable usually pay $8-12 for an entree but I thought because Teddy's prices were expensive that the food would probably be better .

My personal favorite is the pumpkin, the sweetness of which blends nicely with the spice from the potato and channa. Their wrapper is incredible, it's a large round flat bread with a dense chewy texture lightened by the inclusion of ground chickpeas between the flaky layers. They really know what they're doing and it puts other versions around the area to shame.  While the roti is the central item on the menu, the sides and snacks are tasty too. One standout are the doubles, two small circles of puffy bread, brushed with a sweet tamarind sauce and sandwiched around a spoonful of spiced chickpeas. Reminiscent of a puri chaat you might find at an Indian restaurant, but given a Caribbean slant.  They used to make their own juices in house, but apparently there's been some new juice making license that made them stop for a while. Hopefully they'll figure it out because the pineapple ginger juice is sweet spicy heaven (and makes a great mixer)",

I ordered 85$ worth of food from this place today including 5 paratha (buss up shot) but apparently the people who work here don't know what paratha is and they gave me dhalpourie instead. They have signs all over their store saying make sure to check your food before u leave the store... now I know it is because they are accustomed to giving people the wrong order!!! I did in fact ask the lady who gave me my bags of food if I should go through and check the order, and she herself went thru the order with me and told me that there were 5 Roti skins in there. I should have made her open it and show me the paratha because it was dhalpourie skins instead. I live 1.5 hours from this place and when I called to tell them they gave me the wrong food, all they said was sorry and I could come now to exchange the Roti. I live an hour and a half away. There was no offer to refund me or offer to let me pick up the Roti the next time I'm in town. So I can't eat my food and I won't be going back to teddys. U just lost your ten year customer.",

Tasted my food, it was BEEF. I call the store, the owner answered and says bring back the order cause I have to see it. I get there, he says \"we are here to serve you,\" but you ordered BEEF! I was like sir, I know the difference between beef and goat, and I know what I ordered was goat. He tried the roti and says \"you don't know food, this is boneless goat.\"Since when does beef and goat taste the same? Goat has a distinctive taste!!! He gets load and tells me \"you don't know food cause your looking for bones and this is boneless goat.\" The girl comes out and I pointed at her, you carried that same bag of beef, charged me for goat and let me walk out with the wrong order, knowingly it was wrong the whole time. Basically speaking, I would not recommend anyone to go there, the service was poor, the owner came out looking to prove something and it was not necessary! I was able to get my money back after being insulted and listening to him yell for 15 minutes. Every customer that walks into any establishment is an opportunity to help keep your dreams alive, and helps to support your vision, but treating a potential returning customer that way was unbelievable. Waist of my time and gas!!! Smh. I would not rate this place at all.",

        "caption": "I'm always conflicted when I eat at Teddy's.  On one hand, the prices are astronomical when compared to the value of the food (particularly when compared to the price of the same dishes in Trinidad).  On the other hand, supply and demand sets the price, and when there are few Trinidadian restaurants in the D.C. area, you pay for those home-style dishes that hit the spot.  Usually, the economic argument wins - I'll gladly pay for good food that I can't really get elsewhere.  Today, however, the scale tipped to the other end of the spectrum.  I ordered \"tomato choka\" - a simple dish made of tomatoes, onions, and garlic.  I was taken aback when I was told this simple dish would set me back $15.  I was floored when I got home, and saw what I got for the money.  At home, I opened the bags concealing this $15 delight, and found to my surprise that only about one fifth of the container contained the tomato choka I had ordered.  The other four-fifths of the container was filled with channa (chick peas), which I had neither wanted nor ordered.  I called Teddy's to complain.  The woman answering the phone informed me that they make the tomato choka from a single can of tomato (CAN??? SACRILEGE!), and they used the channa to fill out the remaining empty space in the container.  This infuriated me for two reasons: (1) The first time I ordered tomato choka from Teddy's, my wife commented that the dish tasted like they used canned tomatoes.  Teddy overheard and informed us that not only did he not use canned products, but he only purchased organic tomatoes from the Union Market farmer's market.  With that much detail, it must be the truth, right? (2) At $15 a pop, you can certainly afford to fill the container with canned tomatoes that cost pennies a pop.  I informed the woman on the phone that Teddy had previously told me he used real tomatoes in the dish, and she informed me that they have always used canned tomatoes. I asked for a refund, and she informed me that if I wanted my money back, I'd have to \"deal with Teddy.\"  I asked her if Teddy was there for me to \"deal\" with, and was informed that he was not even there.  (Was I supposed to sit there until he came in tomorrow?)  I asked her to call Teddy, and told her I was going to call back in 15 minutes.  15 minutes later, my call went to voicemail, and I went to Yelp.  In the two years I've been coming here, I've gladly spent too much money to eat food that made me feel like I was back in Trinidad.  As other reviewers have mentioned, they tend to use channa as filler in their rotis as well, making their high prices seem that much more unreasonable.  However, their roti portions are large, so I kept on coming.  After today, I don't think I'll return, and a 30 cent can of tomatoes will ultimately cost them hundreds of dollars worth of business.  From now on, Crown Bakery about a mile and a half south of Teddy's on the same avenue (Georgia Ave.) will get all my business.  Goodbye to Teddy's $4.00 alou pies, $4.00 doubles, and $15 rotis.  Hello Crown Bakery's $22 buffet breakfasts on Sunday.",
