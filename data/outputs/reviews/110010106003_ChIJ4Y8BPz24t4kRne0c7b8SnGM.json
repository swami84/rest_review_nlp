The house cocktails are amazing blends of flavor and smell, without detracting from the meal in any way.  When you visit, don't limit yourself, try a cocktail or three, order an item from each section of the menu, and don't forget to save room for dessert!  Be amazed as the magicians behind the scenes prepare for you what might be one of the best meals you've had, let alone the best vegetarian meal you've ever had.  The seating can be isolated, or you can be in close proximity to your fellow diners, but it is not a bad thing to have strangers to share the wonder of the menu with.  Even when I've come to the restaurant alone, people can't help but be curious what those around them decided to try that they are missing out on, and conversation comes easy over the absolutely delicious meals that can be had here.",

The host was pleasant and helpful. The service was on point they worked together and knew exactly whom ordered what. The food does come out staggered. I liked that because the flavors are  so different that you just want to taste everything! My son absolutely Love Love Loved the food! As I  have dined at this location and V Street in Philadelphia I will continue to come back again  and again.

I barely even write reviews!  Had no idea what to expect from Fancy Radish but we started with 3 dishes, then ordered 3 more and could have kept going if it wasn't for wanting dessert.  Every. single. dish was perfection. Unique, deliciously surprising, balanced, and beautifully presented.  Service was excellent as well. Eva gave us the best recommendations - dishes we never would have ordered ourselves yet ended up loving the most! She even surprised us with a cranberry sorbet to accompany our two desserts and we really appreciated that, especially since it was also something we normally wouldn't have gotten but ended up drooling over. Very thoughtful. You could see she really believed in the mission of the restaurant and was happy to share her passion for it!  We learned that the restaurant takes being plant based extremely seriously. Not only is the food entirely vegan, but even their food delivery services and food sources must have zero animal/dairy products associated with them. Impressive!!  I really hope they expand westward to where I live in Southern California and (in the future,) Oregon, as there's a huge market out there for food like this!  Dishes we ordered: Smoked Chioggia Beet Toast, Pastrami Spiced Carrots, Rutabaga Fondue, Peruvian Potatoes, Grilled Delicata Squash, Spicy Dan Dan Noodles, then Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Pear Tart for dessert.",

I got a table right away even though I walked in after 9pm and I had a helpful waiter to go over the entire menu with me. Since it was my first time there, I was overwhelmed with the menu and the waiter went through the entire thing with me. Talk about customer service! The radish salad was great and so was the corn chowder. These 2 dishes together are filling and don't include pasta/bread which I like because I try to limit carbs when I can. I also got the strawberry shortcake and that was perfect! So yummy. Loved the experience!  One suggestion: Maybe you can have essential oil jars on the tables instead of candles? Safer and better for us to breath in",

We enjoyed four of the dessert offerings. The selection of sorbets and ice creams included mango chili lime, strawberry lemonade and key lime pie. We recommend the dark chocolate namelaka...and the maitake...or \"hen of the woods\" mushroom offering...along with the signature dish \"Fancy Radish\".  Smoked tofu will change your concept of bland tofu...its inspiration is a smoky cheese flavor. The charcuterie of complex flavorful vegetables is unique and creative... including pastrami carrot.

It was all around perfection. Let's start with the drink menu: cocktails galore for people of all alcohol persuasions, and I personally was super excited by the fact that they have orange wines because so few places in DC do. from what I can tell the menu rotates based on the season, which is great because everything was fresh and interesting. The menu has about 10 options in total, and between me and my one other friend we ordered six dishes which was just more than we could eat in one sitting. My personal favorite items were the rutabaga fondue and the Peruvian potatoes. I don't know how these chefs manage to make a vegan food so creamy and delicious but they're killing the game and make amazing food. Run, don't walk, to Fancy Radish. You will not be disappointed.",

I ordered the Dan Dan noodles and I said this would be enough for now. If I needed more food I would order something else. I was given a very uncomfortable look (sometimes frown eyebrows). Whenever she took order she always looked at my friends but not me (as I was trying to make eye contact to order the food). I did not feel welcome the entire time. This being said, I will not visit this restaurant again. If you feel like giving your customer an attitude then you shouldn't be working in customer service.",

Let go down  the list: stuffed avocado was not my favorite at all it did not taste like anything in particular,  it had different textures but it seemed too salty; Peruvian potatoes,  dont be fooled, it is a very  hardy dish with thick cut potatoes, dried olives peanuts and semi-spicy sauce  on top, one of my 2nd favorites; spicy Dan Dan noodles is not a joke and it definitely bring all the spice, it's a ramen with crispy shiitake mushrooms for great texture; Za'atar grilled maitake, is hands down my favorite dish so oh all time. It has a little  of everything, every time bite into the food its a different taste. The whipped lemon tahini is really what makes or is my favorite. You have to eat about two or three dishes to be full. Do not forget about desert! I love the butter scotch panna cottage, guava cream chesse empanadas and the sticky toffee pudding. The menu changes in a accordin to the season,  but never a big change .This place is original and not your typical fried that you will get at your typical vegan Restaurant. Note, I always sit at the bar because I am usually  by myself,  I have never had a bad experience, and the bartenders will tell you the truth and will  never over sell you.  Real food for real people! At the end of the day there something for everybody,  meat eaters will definitely enjoy  this place trust me!\ud83d\ude09 *special thanks to Max!

FYI, I think their regular dinner menu is much nicer than their happy hour. There\u2019s a reason the food on the HH menu is only offered two hours a day and only at the bar, it\u2019s meant for snacking and is much more simple in preparation.

        "caption": "Creative culinary dishes bursting with flavor! Glad I chose Fancy Radish for my birthday dinner. All the dishes combine interesting ingredients and textures that surprisingly work well together and tickle my taste buds with rich flavor. It's a paradise for vegans and even meat lovin' hubby loved all the dishes!  The Celery Fritter app was my favorite - never knew celery could taste so good! The creamy avocado cilantro sauce with chunks of celery paired perfectly with the crispy fritters stuffed with veggies. Even my hubby who hates celery with a passion enjoyed the fritters!  The Rutabaga Fondue was my hubby's favorite with creamy rich fondue and warm soft pretzel roll. The fondue tastes like cheese with a pop of flavor from the root rutabaga vegetable. I wish we asked for another pretzel roll to mop up all that creamy fondue!  The Stuffed Avocado with cauliflower rice and puffed shell with tangy sauce was another stand out dish. I appreciate how the sauce is on the bottom to elevate the flavor in every bite.  The roasted Peruvian Potatoes with cheesy sauce and crunchy peanuts and black sesame seeds was also quite tasty.  Although the spicy Dan Dan Noodles looked appetizing, I'm glad we went with the creamy Sunchoke Ramen. The noodles were cooked al dente with rich creamy sauce.  The best part was dessert! The S'mores bar was divine with a decadent brownies, creamy marshmallow \"ice cream\" made of coconut milk (didn't melt!), dusted with graham cracker crumbs, and topped with a birthday candle! Love the modern take on S'mores and was thoroughly stuffed by the end of the meal.  The cocktails were a bit disappointing and don't measure up to the food. They are mostly whiskey based or have a strong citrus flavor, they need to be a bit more balanced out.  I wasn't a fan of the bubbly Back to the Basics, it tasted like a lemon drop. The sparkling wine was quite dry and the eldenflower didn't add the hint of sweetness that I was hoping for.  The Winter Travels packs a punch with scotch, rum, and brandy. It tastes like an Old Fashioned with a hint of sweetness from the cranberry cordial.  My hubby enjoyed the boozy Woodmaze with bourbon, cherry, and chai. I would like to see the cocktail menu retooled with more vodka based cocktails.  Definitely make a reservation, I was turned down as a walk-in even though half the restaurant was empty.  Excited to come back for another round of those celery fritters and warm pretzel roll as well as venturing into new culinary dishes!",

It's location oh H street is in a very trendy area with easy parking. The decor and ambiance is great very calming, the staff was wonderful and really made the experience special. The silverware and dishes we're switched after every dish, which added an extra special factor to the experience. Now the dishes, we ordered the stuffed avocado, rutabago fondue (my personal favorite), Peruvian potatoes, trumpet mushrooms, Dan Dan noodles (spicy), all were delicious and would recommend. Every dish was presented beautifully and had an explosion of taste. Even though I was stuffed we ordered dessert because o just wanted the full experience so we're gluttonously ordered 2 desserts because o couldn't decide, we ordered the toffee pudding and the s'mores brownie. My husband loved the pudding, which was my least favorite meal. I thoroughly enjoyed the brownie it was so rich and de adwnt, I couldn't finish it.",

The prices are reasonable, the service is top notch, and the menu is inspired.  I've had the stuffed avocado every time I've gone and I have seriously considered getting it twice in one night. The tomato tart from the romesco sauce is balanced by the buttery avocado and the crunch of the fried rice.  The Peruvian potatoes come with a rich yellow, spicy aji Amarillo sauce that they should bottle and sell to the masses. I could pour the sauce over cardboard and eat it.  The rutabaga fondue comes with tart pickled vegetables and (what seems like) freshly baked bread. Vegan fondue perfected!  H street has slowly become a hub for good vegetarian food but it seems as if Fancy Radish competes with the intimate sit down restaurants more than the other vegetarian spots. A truly memorable dinning experience and I can't wait for the brunch!!",

I arrived 10min early to see how the setup and vibe is (being my first time here) I sat at the bar waiting until time for my seating. Bartender addressed me I told him it was my birthday an I don\u2019t usually drink so I may not have a drink. He said he WILL make a drink for me and not to worry about it. The drink he offered was too strong for me so he made another. Still very strong he made another( by the tone of his voice I could see he\u2019s tolerance was running thin) I then asked if my table is ready. The hostess then said the people siting at the table is going to leave soon...I felt bad to rush someone to finish their meal for my party to eat, especially when i made my reservation 2 weeks in advance. By having a reservation I\u2019m expecting to walk in be greeted accordingly and have my table ready to seating. But instead I was billed 2 drinks, a lady at the bar picked up my tab saying I don\u2019t understand why he gave you those drinks they are strong an I\u2019m a drinker... i greatly appreciated the gesture. Now that it is 15min pass my time to be seated I asked for a table and addressed that I made a reservation so I should have a seated area ready for my party, shortly afterwards was redirected in a corner of a table of 4, while the original table of 6 (I was told and shown I'm to be seated at) is still accompanied but 3 people finishing their drinks. at the table the server was not as attentive as i thought. i wanted to have a conversation about the food and what to expect but the server just wanted to place the orders and leave us alone. hardly any interaction, had to ask for refills of water, had to ask for everything....very disappointed to celebrate my birthday dinner at this place. Over all being a fancy place, service was nothing to the name. Food however is nice... service \ud83d\udc4e I do not recommend this place for a special occasion, but as a stop by eat at the bar type. yes, then you don't have to worry about the service to much you can just enjoy the food and be pressured by the bar tender to buy drinks back to back as long as your seated their.",

        "caption": "TL;DR- Loved it! Delicious food and it's all plant-based. Not (too) oily or heavy. I went here with a date (non-vegan) and he loved the food, too. It's on the edge of $$ and $$$. It's kind of like a tapas bar in that they have a bunch of small plates and you order multiple for your meal. They recommend 3 per person, which works out to be at ~$45 for your main meal per person. If you want drinks and dessert that will be even more. I don't think neither of us were very hungry, so we only ordered 3 plates, 2 drinks and 2 desserts between us. > Rutabaga Fondue: 4/5. They served us pretzel bread with the fondue and a mixture of pickled veggies. The flavor of the fondue is somewhat cheezy, but it's very much a plant-based cheese. It doesn't imitate the flavor or texture of real cheese much. Even so, it was still tasty, but nothing to rave about. > Peruvian Potatoes: 5/5. This was my favorite dish of the evening and was recommended to me by the waitress. I can see why it's popular! The sauce is absolutely delicious. There's a kick, but I highly recommend if you can handle spicy dishes. I have a high spice tolerance the spice level was medium-high for me. > Spicy Dan Dan Noodles: 5/5. Another popular dish recommended by the waitress. Not as good as the peruvian potatoes, but still spot on and memorable. The noodles had a great bite, the sauce was spicy (but in an Asian way). Around the same level of spice (maybe a little less) than the Peruvian potatoes) > Staycation: 4/5. A surprising combination of coffee, coconut and pineapple. The sweetness of the coconut and was toned down by the coffee. I was concerned about the caffeine, but it didn't have a strong (or any?) effect on me. > Woodmaze cocktail: ?/5 My date's drink. Very bourbon-y and served in an English china teacup. I tasted it and had a strong bourbon taste yet was mellowed out by the other flavors added. > Blueberry Tart: 5/5. This was my dessert. I really enjoyed the refreshing combination of the lemon, blueberries and frangipane.The poppy seed ice cream was meh, but I didn't mind because I loved the tart so much. I'm glad it wasn't overly sweet. The fresh blueberries and lemon curd cut through the sweetness of the dish nicely. > Peaches and Cream: 4/5. The flavors here were great. It was almost like a decomposed peach pie with the hush puppies, peach sorbet and cream. It seemed much less substantial than the blueberry tart, which is why I deducted a star (which is weird, considering that this dessert is more expensive).",

Our favorites were the BLT, fondue, and potatoes.  I could eat and endless supply of those potatoes, great flavor with the dried olive and spices sauce.  For the main I had the dan dan which was a great rich dish with a good kick of spice and tasty crisp mushrooms.  Another main we ordered was the grilled summer squash which was a very flavorful lighter option.  For desert we had the strawberry sorbel which was very tasty with the saffron ice cream.  However the s\u2019mores dessert takes the cake. It was a great mix of nostalgic flavors mixed with bbq nuts and a more rich chocolate.  My only gripe here is the serving sizes. If you are hungry expect to order at least three dishes each.",

        "caption": "I went here with a group of six, after waiting over a month for our reservation. The only thing higher than our anticipation was our expectations. Fancy Radish did not disappoint. First, with a group of six, we were able to order the whole menu. I'm not exaggerating, we ordered every dish on the menu. We also ordered 6 different cocktails, and 4 of the six desserts. Therefore, I feel very qualified to write this review of the restaurant as a whole. Our group contained vegetarians, pescatarians, omnivores, and meat-lovers alike. Every single person, including our skeptical meat-lovers, walked away feeling full and in a dream-like state. Every dish was beautifully presented even more delicious than the last. A very special shout out to the rutabaga fondue, mushroom pasta, beets, and dan dan noodles. If you eat anything here, you must get those. The staff was incredible. Our waitress took the time to discuss the menu, talk us through her favorites, and as each dish came out - highlighted some of her favorite flavor profiles. Our water dishes never reached below half-full, and she consistently traded our personal plates for clean ones so that flavors stayed separate. The cocktails were unique, delicious, and had enough variety that you could find one for every person in your group. The desserts, while not as outstanding as the entrees, were still delicious and a wonderful way to end your evening. The ambiance was cozy and romantic, with plants and interesting light fixtures abound. Our favorite part? The price. While Fancy Radish is a higher end restaurant, we did not find the price to be prohibitive. It was more than your typical night out, but I've eaten much less quality food for a higher price in DC.  All in all, we absolutely loved our experience. We're already comparing calendars to make our next reservation. I could not recommend enough, it was a wonderful evening.",

Went there to dinner last night, not sure what to expect, and it turned out that every dish we ordered was a hit and the server was very accomodating and helpful throughout the evening!  The Chermoula Grilled Tofu, finely slathered with eggplant, was firm and slightly crispy, and the rich Stuffed Avocado with tangy romesco sauce was outstanding with so many complementary flavors.  The vegan Rutabaga Fondue, served with fresh, warm pretzel bread and pickles for dipping, was a winner in the Comfort Food category!  At our server's recommendation, we saved room for dessert with the Sumac Sour Cherries, warm donut holes in a cherry sauce, and the tiramasu-like Atlantic Beach Cup, layers of lemon custard, cream and raspberries with a crunchy bottom.  Accompanied with extraordinary cocktails throughout the meal, including the whisky-based Woodmaze served in a tea cup, Fancy Radish is a home run definitely worth repeating!",

When we asked for more, we were given a pretzel cut in half, a not-so-subtle hint to not request more pretzel for the overpriced dish.

Raphanous shade cocktail, given a couple of minutes for ice to partially melt, was luscious. All dishes: Peruvian potatoes; ful; chermoula tofu; and Dan Dan noodles were delicious. Blueberry tart as well. Espresso was made from very good coffee, but needed more foam and should have been available as decaf. Spoons for on-the-side sauces and espresso should have been on the table. Overall, a delicious dining experience.",

We ordered so much food to split between the four of us and we were all so blown away with each plate. It was definitely one of the best meals I\u2019ve ever had as everything was perfectly cooked, flavorful, beautifully presented and so mouthwateringly delicious and savory.  I really like the high end side of vegan food.  Our tops picked were the spicy dan dan noodles, rutabaga fondue, Peruvian potatoes, trumpet mushrooms and the seared maitake.  Fancy Radish\u2019s mushroom game is so on point!  I cannot wait to come back!  A huge thank you to Chefs Rich Landau and Kate Jacoby for bringing down their passion and wisdom to the DC area!!",
