        "caption": "If you\u2019re looking for a deliciously juicy burger, with the most balanced sweet & savory combination, look no further than EBH Kitchen\u2019s Minas Burger. Delicately balanced between sweet, salty, and savory. Incredibly juicy patty. And the guava sauce and cheese sauce combination is TO DIE FOR. I would bathe in it.  If you\u2019re looking for the best chicken sandwich on the planet, undoubtedly, it is found here. Juiciest, crispiest chicken I\u2019ve ever had (on a sandwich especially!), and paired with the purple slaw, lettuce, brioche bun, and delightful sweet chili mayo (which I would also bathe in), it is an explosion of flavor in each bite.  Also, cheese fries are my LOVE LANGUAGE, and these do not disappoint.  All-around the most delectable, mouth-watering burgers, sandwiches, and grain bowls in the Boston and surrounding areas.",
