Seriously. And yes, I know, that's technically three words, four if you're one of those mutants that counts \"&\" as a word just because it is a stand-in for \"and\". But think about the symmetry of it: macaroni & cheese.  Macaroni..  and cheese  It's one thing. Its one thing all by itself, Macaroni & cheese is its own stand-alone thing, and we all know it. We've known it since childhood.  And someone went and made macaroni & cheese into its own stand-alone pizza topping. I'm not joking! You can get macaroni & cheese pizza at Front Door.  Even a friend from Italy admitted that it was a clever move and worthy of both macaroni & cheese and pizza. Although I think I saw her soul dim slightly in her eyes as she said it. Just a bit. Probably because a thousand years after the Roman Empire, they had not thought of macaroni & cheese pizza themselves despite having all the ingredients right at their fingertips.  But seriously, go forth and eat some macaroni & cheese pizza if you can, and do it now. It comes with bacon, but do what I do and ask for the bacon to be replaced with..  ...wait for it..  ...anchovies.  No, seriously! Just do it! Trust me! You will live your years eternally grateful that you discovered this treasure. If you're feeling super squirrely then also pair this with the Caesar salad with anchovies (this is a test; technically a \"Caesar salad\" without anchovies is just a boring old regular salad). But no matter. With or without a salad, you have to try the macaroni & cheese pizza with anchovies.  Go forth and enjoy, my friends. Hoist high the banner of the Legion and conquer yourself some pizza, there, Centurion. You will NOT be sorry.",

I saw just another bar slinging microbrews and passing off bar food as restaurant cuisine. At the end of my meal, I found nothing to convince me otherwise.  If you can put yourself in this mindset Front Door does offer slightly above average pub grub and reasonable prices. I had a cobb salad. This is my go-to meal when on the road and in a new place. The service was quick and the meal enjoyable. Overall I found Front Door a nice enough place for either a quick meal or a place to hang out and have a few drinks.",

The inside definitely looks clean and well taken care of and the overall atmosphere is calm and relaxing when we went.  The food was fantastic. The salad was amazing, the pizza was cooked to perfection, and just the garlic bread was enough to keep me coming back. You guys know your food and I'll tell you, it was amazing!  But that's not even the best part about this place! The service we received was above and beyond. I haven't had service this good in forever! That's what really set you guys apart. Unfortunately we didn't get the gentleman's name that took care of our table but from our conversation, he was pretty new to Idaho still (hope you like it here!)  Anyways, you guys definitely have a new and returning customer because of a standard in service you provided to me tonight. Give that man a raise and have him train others! He knows what he is doing! It was excellent!",

Some of the best mac and cheese I have ever had.   The cheese was perfectly melted and creamy and all the flavors came through.  Then I came a week later expecting the same result and was utterly disappointed.  The cheese was lumpy and did not have the same texture.  I am surprised I am giving them 3 stars because of the inconsistencies.  I will attempt the mac and cheese one more time and the stars will change based on the next experience.",
