The grilled chicken was wonderfully tender with beautiful grill marks. It wasn\u2019t too dry and the sauce on top was slightly sour, slight sweet \u2014 really tasty with the brown rice base. It came with macaroni salad and cole slaw (i chose that over kimchi because I wasn\u2019t feeling like spicy food) and both had just enough seasoning without an overwhelming taste of mayo.  There was a decent amount to the grilled chicken plate, and a hearty portion of chicken. Would definitely grab again (and maybe try the musubi next time!)",
