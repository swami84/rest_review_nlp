The wontons are accompanied with a Chinese leafy vegetable known as \"Gai Lan\" and swimming in a bone broth. That bone broth soup. Oh my. It's milky white, smooth, slightly sweet and oh so delicious.  I'll update when I get to try the other dishes here but I could see myself coming back just for the wonton soup only even if the rest of the food is only ok.",
