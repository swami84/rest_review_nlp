It then took another 42 minutes to receive our drinks from the bar. Our food was ordered after the drinks but arrived before our cocktails did. You could tell the staff was just in a complete state of chaos. My husband had the filet, which was a whole 1/2 inch in thickness. (You could buy a better steak at Publix) my grouper was so over cooked it was like chewing rubber. It is so sad bc the restaurant itself is beautiful but I would never subject myself to that kind of dining experience ever again. I hope they get their act together.....",

We waited for a lil while. Once seated, we waited again. Our server was polite. Dinner Menu is simple and to the point. We were served plantain chips with a very delicious dip called crema. That dip is the bomb. I requested the filet mignon, came with sweet potato & kale. The sauce they used was good but it is spicy so be aware. You can request a Garlic based sauce (found out after the fact). Server requested a kale plate with the garlic sauce, it was way better for me since I do not like spicy. Filet Mignon was not cooked at medium. Seemed dry on the outside but overall it wasn't bad. My BF had the steak tacos, he said they were alright. I had a drink special ketel one botanical vodka spritz. Pleasantly surprised on how good it was. Overall, customer service is my pet peave... greetings & initial contact with customers is extremely important, especially in a timely manner. (side note: it wasn't packed or crowded). Food can definitely be better. I did like the decor! Assessment for me would be a 3.5 I know this is a new place, hopefully it gets better.",

        "caption": "For the $142.00 cost of dinner I expected a lot better quality and service.  I made reservations online for 7:00 p.m. the night of my reservation I called to see about moving it up to 615. The lady on the phone advised me to follow and click the link on a confirmation text I received. I did that under no way to change or modify your reservation. I called back to advise and she said that she could not change my reservation because they were only told that way by clicking the link. I advised her that there is no way to change your reservation from clicking that link and she responded by asking me if I scroll to the bottom of the page. Yes I sure did I am not an imbecile. I then asked for the restaurant manager and she said she was the restaurant manager. Again she confirmed she didnt know how to change a reservation but just come in cause they are not busy.  I guess she never heard of a pander pencil in the piece of paper to simply write a note down to make sure that a reservation is changed that's what they get for trying to be overly modern but not ready for it.  Getting there there is no parking for the restaurant I would suggest try to park in the hotel parking for free rather than use the valet which you feel obligated to leave a tip.  Getting seated was another mess we walked up to the restaurant said we had a reservation and said we would like to sit outside we were told it's open seating so go sit wherever you want. Next we walk outside and all the tables near the railing with the best view all had reserved signs on it.  When you make your reservation it says you can't reserve certain seating it's 1st come 1st served so these reserved signs were pretty confusing. Asking one of the servers was a mistake because she described it as yes they are reserved you can have any table you want they can all be yours but they are all reserved.  I may not be the brightest bulb but I tell you what hearing that come out of her mouth was pretty damn confusing. At this point we just sat down at a table.  For being not very crowded at all and a Monday service food everything with very very slow.  Currently the entire places under construction so the views that are being painted on their photo are also often obstructed and not so picturesque currently.  At $14 for each drink I think they must get a commission because O my goodness did they push those drinks.  We were asked if we wanted drinks 1st then water was brought then asked we wanted drinks again.  Order drinks because I felt like it was kind of what we were supposed to do and then had to tell her we would like some appetisers. Next appetisers came out we had our drinks. Finish the appetisers and she comes over do anything else well yes we came here for dinner so we were like to put in our entree order. That's correct we put in drinks appetisers ate the appetisers before she even asked if we wanted something else.  At the 30 minute mark of not getting our entrees to server comes over and says very nervous and very polite but basically says that the kitchen has messed up my food and that they were going to give us a round of drinks for free. Trying to be understandable we said OK and we got the same drinks that we got before.  This is where it gets really sloppy.Both drinks that we got originally were good.   The new drinks regard were very sloppy they were in either a different type of glass or they were missing ingredients. When the missing ingredients were brought up the bartender if you want to call her that may no attempt to professionally prepare the drink again rather than dumping a large amount of cinnamon directly in the center of the drink.  All this showed me was her lack of class and what came out as frustration in my drink because she messed it up and had to fix it. I am putting photos of Before & After of all of these things so you can see for yourself.  I won't say I will go back at least right now or anytime soon they are far away from being able to say they are worth a $140 for dinner for 2.Even when they tried to fix it with the drinks there bartender lac",

It took 25 minutes I would say to get our drinks. It was a Monday and it was not busy. We ordered our food and it just went south after that. The food was very bland, no flavor at all. I ordered a burger well done and it came out pink. Someone else ordered a burger with just lettuce and cheese and it came out with everything on it. We ordered a new burger and waited an hour and still nothing came. We asked for salt and pepper for the asparagus and it never came. We were so hungry due to small food portions that when we left we went and ordered an XL pie from papa johns. The service and food were horrible, but hey the views were great!",

Called a day ahead to make reservations for the outside rooftop and was told it was on a \u201cfirst come, first served basis\u201d. Called the day of for directions and to confirm what time the rooftop was opening. Was told the same thing \u201cit opens at 4 and it\u2019s on a first come, first serve basis\u201d. Arrived a few minutes earlier than opening time and was told it was \u201cReservation Only\u201d with quiet the attitude from one of the employees. We explained the situation and that we were told TWICE that it was on a first come, first serve basis. If you call the recording for the restaurant it clearly says \u201cfirst come, first serve basis\u201d. Absolutely nothing but attitude was given even from the manager Juan who was nothing but dry and condescending. Try Bulla Gastrobar instead.",

We assumed she was a hostess because she was bringing people to their tables. Took 20 minutes to receive drinks. The server told us there was a blueberry mojito on special. No mint leaves, tasted watered down, was flavored with bright blue food coloring and sugar. Unable to even drink it. The cheese board was dry and tasted old!",
