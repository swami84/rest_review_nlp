Not even an hour ago I placed a call speak with the supervisor to address this situation and right away this particular manager Gino was his name, listen attentively and determined this situation to be unacceptable as well had rushed me out a courtesy order as a means to compensate mean 4 any inconveniences and unpleasantries. I am very impressed with the management Services of this particular restaurant and I would recommend them to anyone within their jurisdiction to do business.

When i finally got a hold of PATRICK he said it would be an hour and thirty for carry out. So i then decide to pull up to domino's and walk in and ask how long would it be then the man who suprising kinda looks like Patrick said it would be thirty minutes, while he was talking I could literally see PATRICK on the phone hanging up on customers. Then I left and decided to call again just to see if it would happen again. Guess what... PATRICK answers the phone then hangs it up again (twice) then finally answers and I ask for the manager then he hangs up. At this point I'm just annoyed. So I call again and surprisingly PATRICK actually picks up so I ask for the manager again and then says he is the manager which then I began to tell them how horrible their service is. Like I understand it's late at night and it's the 4th of July but picking up the phone and immediately hanging up in customer face is just quite rude. They probably get horrible customers all the time but domino's is a business in which their should be good customer service no matter what.",

Firstly, the pizza here is expertly made to your specific order, the sodas are cold and the rest of it is par quality for dominos. The food here isn't what makes this location special, it's the people. I one time, with a friend, showed up and ordered a pizza, then asked if we could make it a delivery and they could drop me and my friend off at school with the pizza and they did it without charging a delivery fee (we tipped well of course). I've eaten here while homeless, free of judgement, and the people here treated me with the utmost respect. I worked in ybor for a while and would order here at least once a week and although none of the delivery drivers would ever cross a line of comfort with me they always made me feel comfortable and they were friendly and I consider these people family. Never tip under $5 or less than 20%. These people are good people.",

But she didn't make me feel bad about calling and complaining. Which i always feel bad about that. Specially because I'm always scared my food with be spit in. She took the initiative to even make the pizza herself.  She is freaking awesome. She deserves a raise for a new postion in your company.  I will be called back and placing my order with her not online anymore.  Thank you Shae.",

We called and they said the food was brought back after a delivery attempt. My phone was sitting right next me to on loud. We had no missed calls or texts. I asked to speak with a manager and the manager (rikki) could truly care less. Said it would take an another hour before the food would be delivered again (still implying this was somehow our fault). I asked for a refund and she said the money has been refunded and hung up. We had a small child with us and 4 other people waiting for food. Worst service ever experienced with a pizza company. We have been eating dominos pizza for over 10 years as our choice of delivery pizza. Read someone else had the same issue.",

The manager to whom I spoke about the issue was completely unapologetic and uncompromising. He had a litany of excuses as to why they couldn't accomplish a successful delivery, and offered no other options. I cancelled the order. With so many other pizza delivery options, I will not order from Dominos anytime in the near future. My next order will be from Pizza Hut tomorrow evening.

I called and spoke with the manager William and he said due to \"policy\" he would be unable to give me my food.

The Time's have changed and trends in pizza have changed, and Domino's has tried to evolve along with our tastes, sometimes more successfully than other times.  The dough  has enough gluten, but not too much. Those of you who have bought high quality 00 high gluten flour from Italy, cold aged in the refrigerator to make pizza noted the incomparable taste, but at the cost of a some GI distress in digesting the high gluten flour. I also haven't detected the effects of baking powder, which transform me into an Orca with a bloated belly.  The sauces, especially the Marinara are to my liking and I always order extra. Too much sugar or high fructose sweeteners are the bane of commercial pizza sauces, the Domino's sauces are not overly sweet. The ingredients seem fresh and are sprinkled on in the correct proportions for taste.  An interesting option is the gluten free pizza, and in this case a gluten free and even a dairy free (cheese less) pizza can be had. Family members who are gluten intolerant and dairy intolerant or with allergies can now enjoy their pizza alongside the rest of the family. Now Domino's can make gluten free pizza cheese-less pizza almost as good as the home made pizzas crafted by this old pizza chef.  Domino's  picked up fresh and hot, not 15 minutes after the pizza craving hits. That's hard to beat.",
