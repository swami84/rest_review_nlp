It's been so long since I had had Indian and Bombay fare exceeded my perception of what I remembered. My boyfriend, who went with me, wasn't a fan of Indian before we went here, but with the vegetarian options and watching me almost cry because of how good the Naan was, I think his mind was forever changed. The chai was delicious, even if admittedly smaller than expected. Naan is not pictured because I ordered it a while into the meal, but it was so soft and warm and wonderful. There was also a giant mural with Anthony Bourdain which really touched me. Please give this place a chance, it won't disappoint.",

My partner and I just moved to the DMV from NJ, where we had a place we visited religiously for thali & let me tell you it\u2019s a great close second. We got the Bombay thali for two ( consisted of 3 meats, lamb, goat and chicken ; three veggies, spinach, chickpeas and lentils, plus accompanying herbed yogurt, pineapple spicy chutney, and a pickled pepper side). The meats ; all incredibly tender and flavorful! The lamb was the star, for me, my partner said they could\u2019ve eaten a whole bowl of just chickpeas. Everything was hot and fresh when it arrived to our table, and the service was great minus a small wait when we were originally seated.  The only critique I\u2019d say is that naan should be included with the thali, as it\u2019s a staple I\u2019m used to accompanying my meal with no extra charge. But over all, we will be back! Pictures and more details are available on my food blog IG: @hungryhungryheaux, same for Facebook. Cheers \ud83c\udf7b!",

They don\u2019t skimp in the lamb and the biryani is moist and tasty. They put chapati over the biryani which gives it this great steamy effect when they cut it open for you. Also the biryani is chock of veggies. The only thing I\u2019d say I didn\u2019t appreciate is they only give you one piece In the $4 order of garlic naan. Aside from that I\u2019d say go back - we split the bill - $38.50 - and defiantly got our moneys worth in terms of quantity and quality. Yum.",

Here's why we enjoyed it:  1) Space: It's pretty big with outdoor patio seating and seating in two areas inside. The kitchen is open in the back so you can watch them back your food.  2) Food: It's tasty and the menu is diverse. They even have a kid's menu. My wife, toddler, and I ordered the butter chicken, two orders of naan, rice, mango chutney, and two glasses of chai for lunch. Everything was very tasty (the chai is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy) and it filled us up for only $33.  3) Service: The staff are very kind.  This may be our new go-to spot on Capitol Hill.",

I can definitely endorse the menu at Bombay Street Food as authentic to Indian tastes. Went there twice with family and friends, and in fact introduced a friend to Indian food for the first time there. Recommend starting with a Bhel Puri or Pav Bhaji, maybe some pakoras from the Monsoon section. The Veg and Non Veg thalis are a great way to experience all the different flavors and colors. Be sure to go for the raita or mango chutney if the food is too spicy (but my american friends had no issues with the spiciness). If you're willing to venture further into traditional indian dishes, you can't go wrong with the Chicken Biryani or the Butter Chicken. Be sure to finish off your gut busting meal with a cutting chai. In fact, order it twice.",

        "caption": "Possibly the worst service I have ever seen anywhere, and that is saying something for an Indian restaurant. We had our water poured, then nothing. A few minutes later an Asian gentleman came over asked if we were ready to order. No drinks offered, not offering any help with the menu, just asked nervously if we were ready. We asked about the plater for two and and the spice level but all he could say was how everybody loved it. We took a chance and order it. 30 minutes later it arrived and an Indian gentleman brought it and then proceeded to walk off before my wife asked which one was the goat. He mumbled something but we could barley understand him. And good lord, the goat was very spice and full of small bones. Dinners should be warned. The lamb was extremely tough. You could not cut the lamb by the knife provided. It was chewy and tough. The butter chicken was overly spicy and yet lacked any complexity. While each dish looked like what they were supposed to, they lacked the multi layered flavor that very good Indian food should have. My wife was able to flag down a waitress and asked if we could have a couple of glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon. The waitress looked like she had no clue what we were asking for. My wife pointed to the wine list. Possibly the smallest and worse wine list I have ever seen. The waitress came back with two glasses of red wine, and when my wife said we had asked for two glasses of white wine. Her response was that we had asked for Cabernet and that is what the bartender gave her. She clearly didn\u2019t know anything about wines. We just decided to keep the red. There was no table maintenance, nothing was cleared. Our water was refilled but no check back by anyone. And when the server brought us the check he didn\u2019t clear the table or ask why nothing was eaten. We gave him our card, sat there with a dirty table until he cane back. Although the decor of the restaurant is cheerful enough, unfortunately the level of service and quality of food leaves much, much more to be desired. On dining strip where you world class restaurants like Rose\u2019s and Ambar, this is really not acceptable. This place operates like third rate rate kebab house. It will probably become just another mediocre Indian restaurant like all the others.",

I saw a black couple seated at the booth so did not know why we asked to sit at a smaller table . Some Indian owners suffer from inferiority complex and like to treat people of Indian origin not the same as others . The Pav Bhaji was excellent. The Bhelpuri did not taste like authentic Bombay bhrl since there were no onions. It was also dry. The Kati roll was not moist like a Frankie in Bombay .  I wish them best of luck",
