Also ordered a cranberry almond Sonoma salad and they put blue cheese on it. On the menu it didn't say it came with bleu cheese. And lastly they have me the option of white or multi grain bread and I was given white. I'm willing to give them a second chance because the tomato bisque soup was good but I didn't touch the salad because I can't stand even a little bleu cheese. But management needs to do something about this and their dirty tables that seemed like they only get cleaned once a day",

They have 12 smoky cauldrons filled with a myriad of tasty soup combinations (chicken pot pie soup, white bean and turkey sausage,  chicken tortilla, etc.).  And they ENCOURAGE you to sample the soups!!! Additionally they have bread bowls kicked up a notch with yummy flavors and cheeses.  To add to this zoupa-licious party, you can select a salad and/or sandwich (on multigrain or french bread). Can't decide? No problem, Zoup allows you match two, to create your own combo!! I'm all Zouped up!!!",

Staff were friendly even though they were very busy putting up on line orders. Will definitely stop again.",

The salad is very filling. The staff is very friendly. I order online because their line can get very long during my lunch time at noon. I have never had any issues with my food not being ready when I order online. Everything I order is always freshly made by the time I pick up. You get to customize your meal, when you order online, and if you are a picky eater like myself, then this comes in very handy. I think the price is actually pretty reasonable, considering the portion sizes, especially if you select the try two option. If I see a new soup on their online menu for the day, then I wait in line and try it. You get to try as many soups as you like. Highly recommend this place.",

I actually didn't think the lobster bisque was that good, but really enjoyed the seafood chowder, and went with that instead. I made it a combo and got the chicken Greek wrap. Ehhh pass on the chicken Greek wrap--- I felt like I could have made something better at home-- it was just really bland tasting. Maybe their actual sandwiches on bread are better... especially since the sourdough bread that came with the soup were good.  At least the food comes out pretty quickly, and there's plenty of spots to sit at during lunch.",

You come up to the counter thinking you are about to order but it is really just the sample section so you have an easier (or harder) time deciding what you want.  My service was quick and the food was hot and delicious. Expensive? Not really for a place in the loop. Wrong order review? They print a label on top of your Zoup with your name and what you ordered. Not sure how the order was mixed up but people to make errors time to time. Hope they fixed it if they.",

The best thing about this place is that they allow you to taste the 12 different kinds of soup but the downside, is that everyone wants to taste, and they guys giving out samples are also the guys filling soup orders, so it could take a while of waiting at the soup bins.  The reason why everyone will sample the soup is because they change up their selections daily. And the selections can be pretty interesting. I tasted the pumpkin pie bisque which was too sweet, and the cheeseburger bisque, which was too salty, and the turkey chili, which was just right.  I could make a whole meal out of soup, but for those that can't, there's also salads and sandwiches on the menu.",
