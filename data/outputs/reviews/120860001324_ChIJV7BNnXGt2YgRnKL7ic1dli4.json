When the server was asked to hold the tomato & onion was told by the Manager they do not make changes to any dish, it is served the way it was described on the menu Only, no changes!! To top it off after we finished they took everything off the table - told us they had people waiting. The manager is not very nice, if he were my employee would fire him. The result of this episode is that after spending over $200, we will never go back again & will tell everyone how nasty we were treated.  BAD REVIEW!!!",

However, the quality of the well-curated menu was the salient feature of the restaurant, closely followed by the care and service we received (from Pablo, our server, as well as from conversation with the owner when he visited our table).  I have a general rule to not go to a restaurant twice, so I tend to order various dishes and drinks to get a good feel for a restaurant's brand.  Luckily, they have a tapas-style menu, and we two ordered about a dozen items (and also a few different cocktails and wines), to the extent at which Pablo paused me while I was ordering to suggest and begin moving us to a larger table (4- vs. 2-top).  Our reaction to each item varied between \"this is really good\" to \"this is sublime\" - our favorites being the tiradito, fiocchi, and cauliflower.  I would tag this restaurant as \"elevated cool,\" with a team who continues to thrive in this economy, clearly due to their dedication to quality, hard work, and the customer experience.",

From raw items like ceviche to sweet items like almond pancakes with chocolate chips, to even lomo saltado in the meat section, it is very easy to find something for everyone. We really enjoyed the naan, and the oysters, but the mediterranean chicken with couscous reminded us of a bland arroz con pollo. Unfortunately, they did not have the passionfruit tiramisu which was what drew us to the restaurant to begin with. Perhaps we will be back to try it. The ricotta cheesecake was crumbly- not creamy- and overall pretty forgettable.  What fell short was the service. We kept having to flag down the server to order more food, refill our water glasses, order dessert, get the check, etc. I suspect it had to do with the fact that we were not there for a boozy brunch because when we told the server we would not be ordering drinks he did not hide his disappointment very well. I am practicing dry January and just wanted to have a relaxing sunday brunch with my dad... theres no shame in that \ud83d\ude12.",

With every dish, salads, seafood, meats, to the desert my family and I were extremely satisfied! The food was so tasty that we were discussing how good it was as we ate! And to think we were concerned that there wasn\u2019t going to be enough food! Well...we took home some. Lol!  The staff were all wearing masks, the tables within 6 feet, and our waiter, Sebastian was perfection! We LOVED every moment.  Thank you Reunion for a memorable dinner. We will be back!",

I came here to check out their happy hour. The menu was limited but it didn't disappoint.  I started with Mezcal Caipirinha and Patatas Bravas. Both on HH and were less than $10. I love this cocktail. It's smoky and quite refreshing. The potato dish was flavorful. Still soft but had nice crunchy edges. Then I decided to move inside since the bartender Miguel insisted to make me a real smoked Old Fashioned. I was pretty impressed. It wasn't too sweet, not too bitter, just right. And I loved the fact that he actually smoked the glass for me. It makes a big difference. I also added Al Ajillo Portobello. This was very good too. Perfect with the Old Fashioned. Both were also $9 each on HH menu.  Overall, I had a really good 1st time experience and I actually ended up going back a couple of weeks after just for a cocktail. Although I haven't explored the entire menu, I think this place will attract folks looking for a superb tapas. It's a little hidden and 5-10 minutes from the mall but it's worth the detour.",

Food, stellar, duck croquettes, pan seared salmon with fire corn sauce, Mediterranean chicken n cous cous, chicken flavorful, tender,  and unique use of boneless thighs.  Salmon just a hair overdone(for a chef) due to carryover cooking nothing worth complaining or lessening rating over, still perfection, well seasoned to my surprise and unique as well, croquettes of smoked duck well balanced with sweet fig jam and peppery arugula to cut richness, delicious. Im a professional chef myself, excellent work.  Drinks were phenominal and uniqe, well balanced, had brasil something and miami something house cocktails, really really good. Garnish was visually appealing as well as relevant to flavors profiled in drinks, very important detail to me.  Service was top notch, host made immediate eye contact, had reservation which allowed a choice of inside or outside seating, but humidity was low and temp was good so i opted to eat outside where less people were sitting. Our waitress, a shorter blonde woman, donnella? Dam, im sorry that forgot her name, started with a D, she wore glasses and was so detailed, friendly, engaging, attentive, un rushing, congenial, and knowledgeable of the menu, she is an asset to the restaurant.  Timing was good of drink app and course delivery. Ambiance was perfectly lit inside, clean dinning room, un cluttered,  nice art on walls, stylish chairs and tables, bar very chique, open line kitchen all kitchen staff looked and moved professionally, the food also reflected that.  Outside plants give a feel of separation from rest of shopping plaza, very nice outside furniture and ambiance as well.  Only critique i have is that i saw a waiter leaving the rest room as i entered still wearing his apron, im a professional chef in fine dinning,  that is a NO-NO in the industry. Aprons and hats off before entering restrooms.  Outside of that no complaints worthy of lessening their 5 star rating.  I highly recommend this establishment,  I will return to spend money and bring other guest, definitely a good place that says \"miami\" with over all experience.  Great place glad a co worker told me of it. Great staff, great food, great ambience and good location, dont want it to be downtown or on the beach.  I hope the owner gives a bonus to deserving staff 1x or 2x a yr when profits are good as most staff appears to be great(not just good) at their job, even the gentlemen that wore his apron in the bathroom was a good waiter on the floor.",

The selection of drinks is also super and I loved knowing that everything is prepared there, even the syrups. It is a different space to share with friends, eat delicious tapas and talk with good music and excellent service. 100% recommended :)  (Original) Nos encant\u00f3 el ambiente. El men\u00fa es s\u00faper variado, para todos los gustos, y los d\u00e1tiles rellenos con queso de cabra me hicieron agua la boca. La selecci\u00f3n de tragos tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 s\u00faper y me encant\u00f3 saber que todo lo preparan all\u00e1, incluso los syrups.
