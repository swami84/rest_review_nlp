Service - Poor Waited long periods of time after seating (1/2 hour+) No water, ice, bread, etc. After sitting waiting patiently to served, small 6oz plastic cups were given, and small paper plates. A 64 oz.. of warm bottle of soda was given to each table and customers were told to go to the bar  if we wanted ice or water. This type of service continued until we left about 9:30. We all gathered in honor of a love one and wanted to enjoy the memory, reminisce and enjoy a meal together. We didn't make a fuss about the situation, but I just I needed to Express and rate this experience.",

Although it has been a number of years since I have attended any venue there i was disappointed with the service and food. My other big issue for me was not having a rest room on the main level for seniors or any one with a walking disability. The restroom that was offer was down a step flight of stairs, dark and unsafe. You would think after having this restaurant open for over 25 years, you would think enough of your customers to have put one in on the main level. Now a good experience for me.",

Have to give two stars because \"she\" had a good time that night, but for us that was planning and doing the business was disappointed with  half the service. Party was supposed to start at 9pm sharp because it was a surprise party. My guest were left standing in the cold because they just started decorating the damn place at 9pm. Decoration was so so, space was good. The DJ was good, the photographer was good. Was gypt with the food. food look like some one auntie whipped together some aluminium pans full of mediocre Sunday food, so not what I was expecting. Salmon cakes taste like Jack Mack, and one meatball per guest...\ud83d\ude15, really? Then the food was supposed to feed 60 people, only 47 people showed up, how the hell was it barely enough Food? And to top it off, all our items was not on the table (but let them tell it, it was). Open bar was supposed to be from 10 to midnight but they didn't open it until 10:20, and wanted to shut down at midnight. The bartender was good, but overwhelmed because it was just her for an hour, then she got extra help for about 25 min, then all alone again. We had to stress schedule, and be on our P's and Q's to have it look like everything turned out well for the birthday girl to have a good time and enjoy her night. My initial plan was Ricardos by the bridge, but this place was convenient for my guest, and I wanted  to give a black own business some business. Will I do it again? no, not worth the price at all,only half. But if you decide to have a function here, I advise that you provide your own food or catering, and come 30 to 45 minutes early to see if they prepared your space.",

I was informed the staff will do that and by staff they provided 1 person to decorate the place. 2nd  problem the staff and owner was on line for my food and 3rd I was told there will be 2 appetizers cocktail sandwiches and salmon cakes needless to say there were no salmon cakes. I had to ask for a fork literally 3 times Also they are on team to much to many parties happening right behind each other mine wasn't official over but the guests from the other party were already showing up. Then there was a bag of garbage leftover from God knows when my Aunt had to remove it the odor was so foul. My only compliment is the women staff were pleasant. The food portion was poor All I can say is Thank God I ordered from other Vendors Big Up to those other vendors the food portion were superb Yayo's on 5th in Brooklyn, Patty plus on Livingston,Magnolia  Bakery,Bedford Cheese they made my party a success food wise. I will NEVER utilize this place again Thankfully I live in a State where I have options. My next 3 upcoming events will be held elsewhere. I want to end on saying the Photographers were GREAT!",

Also I personally don't like when a restaurant says how much tip a person HAS to leave, i tip regardless but i tip at 15 percent unless it was impeccable service.

We hired them to serve at the church and after waiting almost one hour for them, they claimed that they had set up at the restaurant.  It took them over thirty minutes to bring the food one block away.  They were paid for food for 80 people and there was barely enough for 20 of us (the other guest grew weary and left). The owner would not answer the phone. When he did appear, he ran in and out stating that he was busy. We were promised an assortment of cakes that turned out to be packaged donuts and coffee cakes. Shame on them for taking advantage of a family during their hour of bereavement!!!!!!!!!!!",
