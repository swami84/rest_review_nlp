I was worried I may have difficulty finding parking space but had the street parking right in front of the restaurant. They also have outside seating. The server was very polite and they were taking extra care to meet our dietary restrictions. But let me tell you this place has a magical and romantic ambiance. Hands down the place to spend a special event with your spouse. The light French ballads in the background just set the romantic mood. Make reservations early and enjoy a memorable night in DC\ud83d\ude0d",

The first floor has a very inviting looking bar which I imagine would be a great spot for a drink on a winter evening. We were seated upstairs where the decor is a mix of arm chairs, various table settings, chandeliers and lots of red curtains. The tables were strewn with rose petals which was a charming touch.  Service was fine - clearly the staff wanted us to be comfortable - and food was all acceptably good but not great. My favorite part of the dinner was the cocktail du jour which was a champagne and lemon cocktail. I also had the Magret de Canard which was good but would have liked less meat and an added vegetable. Dinner for our party of 4 was $245 without tax which I thought was a little overpriced. I would put this restaurant in the \"neighborhood\" category and a good location for dinner before a play at the Folger Theatre.",

I chose from the resturant week menu. Barrat salad for starter it was fresh and different portions neuaveux French. A steak pom frite with nice sauce. Glass of house Merlot.  Profitoles or pear for desert. Rooms and tables for groups of places for 2 with red curtains. All the chairs are arm chairs of some sort. The decorations are red! Popular Talouse Letrec pictures. Nice plates and glasses. For two we were all in 76 dollars. 20 of that was wine by the glass. The experience was good. Relaxing to French and brazilian music. It was a refreshing. There are so unless better French cuisine in town for more. What they did was good and affordable.Brunch was popular we had reservations which is way to do on the internet. It appears to work.

That was a no no no. The service was bad, we had to sit there for an hour plus to get our food, my in-laws chkn sandwich, the bread was terribly hard and dry, my quiche taste like it has been in the freezer for months.

Could offer recommendations for wines. The food was okay, the bread was dry on the ends as it had clearly been sitting out. The food was under seasoned but filling. The dessert we ordered was the profiteroles and they came was virtually no filling and only 3 small ones. The bathrooms are filled with fabrics that were dirty and clearly have not been washed in a long time. The chandeliers are filled with dust and cob webs. Overall not the experience we had hoped for, especially for a $280usd dinner.",

Next I ordered the roasted quail. I'm used to having great food here, but that was awful, it was boring and the filling was gross. Last but not least, about two hours later that night I got unbelievably sick and was vomiting in the bathroom all night. I went to the doctors this morning and they told me it was food poisoning. An hour later, my date texted me complaining about the same issues, and that she couldn't stop vomiting. To top things off, the bill was over 100$ for two soups, and two entrees.

        "caption": "BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. I made a reservation SIX WEEKS in advance for Valentines Day, and I requested a booth with curtains and communicated upfront that we are vegetarians. I chose this restaurant because their regular menu has multiple vegetarian options.  Less than a week before Valentine\u2019s Day, the restaurant calls to announce a special, preset menu for $100/person. This menu includes little to no vegetarian options AND up-charges up to $50 per person for the same items on their regular menu.  When I communicated with the staff and management, they were unhelpful and at times argumentative. They made minimal effort to accommodate or make exceptions. They acknowledged there were limited options and tried to justify the price like I can\u2019t look up the regular menu and do my own math. They also told me they were too busy that night to guarantee the table I requested. I cancelled my reservation.  I would\u2019ve been more open minded about going if the restaurant offered to include something like a bottle of wine to make up the difference, but it sounded like they wanted me to cancel my reservation so they could fill that seat with someone else. This restaurant obviously cares more about exploiting special occasions for maximum profit instead of honoring reservations or customer experience and satisfaction.  It\u2019s not about the money. On principle, we\u2019re not going to pay almost twice as much for limited options and not get the table we requested, especially when we made reservations six weeks in advance and communicated our needs. Do NOT recommend going here.",

The pate is average, but average is not bad. The french onion soup is one of the best I have ever had, gruyere cheese. Deserts are the high quality you would expect from a French bistro. I am convinced this is the place in DC to try French food, for an authentic yet easy introduction.  Service: On top of their game and professional at all times. Front of house is friendly and makes you feel special.  Atmosphere: This place was built for date night, whether first date or night out with the wife. Plenty of privacy around artfully and thoughtfully crafted table alcoves. Shabby Chic French decor takes  you to a timeless Parisian cafe.  I would recommend this place without any hesitation.",
