Service was slow - there was only one woman actually doing her best to cover both the bar and dining room, but there seemed to be two managers who did little else other than talk to customers.  For a steakhouse, it was silly that there was no steak option on the lunch menu. There were sandwiches and burgers and salads, and a bunch of appetizers that promised more than what the entr\u00e9es delivered.  I had a burger with a side salad and the only unique thing about it was that there were olives in the salad. The burger was clearly from a frozen puck and although it was cooked to my order, it was nothing near justifying the price.  The menu needs some clarification and improvements, and definitely a steak option for lunch. There should have been another person serving either the bar or the dining room.  Also, it's difficult to be a professional and maintain your dignity when you have to use the same parking lot as a strip club that is right next door, blasting music onto their smoking patio a few feet away from the Grill entrance.  For the price and quality presently offered, I won't go back. Since they clearly won't be able change their next door neighbor, I definitely won't be back.",

There was more dressing than lettuce and the tomatoes were mushy. The drinks were lack luster and watered down. The music was supposed to start at 8p; started at 845p.

Darryl seemed really rushed and didn't even write our orders down, but the food was good. my boyfriend and I each ordered a cocktail but no prices were listed and we only realized they were $12 each when the bill came. the sides are also ridiculously expensive. it was $60 for two people... a bit more than we'd have liked, but the food and ambiance of the place were really nice nonetheless.",

I happened to not love my margarita drinks, including the special and a regular one, but the other party members reordered the same specials they had and liked theirs.  The surf and turf while excellent turf, the surf seemed too salty to me, as did the risotto portion...not a deal breaker though.  Outdoor seating was pleasant and it feels perfectly safe in their well enclosed patio. The outdoor seating at least, could be more comfortable and supportive.  All desserts were delicious. I've had better espresso though.",

Nothing was disappointing about our meal not one thing. But the thing I really commend them on is their service. We were coming for my boyfriend's birthday and I called a week before to see if they had his favorite dessert. The person I spoke to (I'm assuming the manager or head of staff as they referred to the staff as \"my staff\") assured me they would order the dessert so that they would have it for us in case we decided to dine there. We didn't even have a reservation yet and she said they'd have it for us just in case. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone dining in Springfield.",

It was a full house but nothing a normal restaurant wouldn't normally handle. Complete shitshow (our waitresses own words).  Gave up and left. 50 dollar tab in drinks and 2 apps just waiting for our food (party of 2).  Nightmare. I did get a French onion soup (it sucked) and my wife had her Cesar salad (she said it was good) but come on. Avoid this place at all cost. Completely a waste of an evening.

In all of my years dining out to \"upscale\" restaurants I have never had a waitress sneak something in like that. Bread for the table insinuates that the restaurant offers it complimentary. Very shady! Not impressed at all, especially when paying $150+ to dine there. I will not return and if ever back in Springfield I will not accept the internet recommendation without further research.",

We made a reservation on open table and when we got to the restaraunts they were unable to find it. I showed them the confirmation on my phone and they sat us. We then were approached again by someone asking for our reservation and we gave the same information and were told we could stay.  The restaurant looked beautiful and they had some live background music.  The next hiccup was that we ordered our appetizer with our drinks and it did not arrive until 45 minutes later - normally we would chalk that up to it being busy, however another table with the same server that arrived fifteen minute after us and ordered after that, got theirs about fifteen minutes before us and it was the same app.  The meals were okay, but nothing either of us would return for.  They did give us a rose when we departed which was a nice touch and they have a gated parking lot with free parking which was convenient.  Overall not worth the money, but could have been worse!",

A few people who were in our party there steaks were cold and had to be sent back to be reheated. Our waitress had been a server at 350 Grill for only a month I'm sorry but you do not put a server on a table of 10 people that has only been there a month. The owner is not friendly at all she never greets anyone at the door never says hi how are you be right with you when we told her we have been here 40 mins and have not received our drinks she walked away and went and said something to our waitress never said I'm sorry let me find out what is going on. Have never liked the owner from day 1 she has a bad attitude. When ordering our first round of drinks were totally a different color from our second round of drinks was told when it's busy the bar tenders get sloppy and when it slows down they do the drinks legit whatt really? Me and the people in our party will not being going back there for a while. Word of advice the owner needs to get some manageing advice on how to treat your customers because without your customers your business would not be up and running.",

        "caption": "When you require customers to pay 20% tip no matter what - that usually means your service and  food are damn near impeccable. At least that's what I find in NYC where I live and dine frequently.Not true in my one and only experience at this restaurant. I will not be back. The only reason this rating is 2 stars instead of one is due to the dessert. Really. And I don't think the restaurant makes it.  Let's start with having a 7:30pm reservation, being seated on time - and not seeing ANY food at our table until 8:40pm, not even bread. We knew something was up when people around us who were seated later than us, had their entr\u00e9e before we had bread. When we questioned the waitress, she cited that the kitchen was backed up and that the size of our party (5) might have something to do with it. Umm - there was a party of 5 nearby us, seated after us noshing on their steaks. No pass!  Food: My rib eye steak tasted bland (no seasonings). I requested Medium (warm) and it came partially medium rare and partially well done. How do you do that? I asked the waitress for steak sauce, but by the time she got back with it, I was done trying to deal with the bland beast.  My mother's Chilean sea bass was such a disappointment she didn't finish it - citing it smelled fishy and was probably spoiled (FYI fresh Chileans sea bass does NOT smell fishy. If fresh and cooked properly, it tastes like a cross between buttery lobster and fish.)  Mom said the rice it came with was a minute rice (my mother is from the South - she knows good rice) and the topping was too sweet. She had been at this restaurant 3 times before a year ago and found this dish to be her favorite. So to come back to find the quality went totally downhill was a disappointment.  She sent it back, telling the waitress why, A few minutes later, the waitress came back with an explanation from the kitchen - citing the source for their Chilean sea bass had changed since my mother last came to the restaurant. They would be returning to their previous source in a few months and encouraged Mom to come back. (Which she will not be)  I will say my 93 year old grandmother put a world of hurt on her swordfish plate - so I guess that dish was ok. My dad silently finished his filet mignon, but he was hungry after waiting so long (our entrees didn't come until almost 9pm) My aunt wrestled with her sous vide 1/2 chicken served with bacon-shallot roasted potatoes and vegetable. She doggy bagged most of it because  \"there was no bacon in that!\" ...but seriously, she didn't like her food.  It got better in the end. We ordered the Lady Finger cheesecake - SO so good. The cheesecake is like a mousse - light and creamy. The waitress, surprised my dad with a slice of free cheesecake for his birthday after she overheard us talking about it. Which he appreciated and promptly ate...leaving only a sliver of graham cracker crust as its memorial  The rest of use split the Kentucky Bourbon butter cake. It sounded better than it tasted - but it was ok.  The waitress also did her best to rectify our situation by not charging us for the Chilean sea bass or the cocktail my aunt ordered and disliked. But really - when you REQUIRE patrons to pay 20% tip, the food and service need to be on-point. Not perfect, but on-point. The waitress did apologize profusely, including \"ma'am-ing\" us to death. Not sure whether she was new, just having an off-night or no one has ever taken her to task for service.  And please note: I have been a waitress before, so I am all about tipping properly - in exchange for good service. I am fine paying premium prices - if the food is off-the-chain, which this was not. And I also really get that no one and nothing is perfect. But if you are going to REQUIRE people to pay 20%, you better be damn near it, most of the time - on fleek!",

        "caption": "My friends and I probably have visited the 350 Grill from the time it opened until not too long ago - most definitely for the last time. I'd like to warn all future (and current) customers of the unfortunate changes the business owners decided to put into place.   I went to dinner with 2 of my friends, of which 1 was to arrive about 45 minutes after our arrival. Our 3rd friend messaged us to order the entree so it would be about ready by the time they arrive. Right after we received the message and placed the order our friend messaged again to let us know that they would be delayed. Immediately (approx. 2 min after having placed the order with the waiter) we called the waiter back to the table and asked to delay all of our orders for a few minutes. The initial response was \"We can't do that.\" At my question why that was the case I received the answer \"I put the order in the computer, we can't stop the order now.\" He was kind enough to \"make an exception\" and came back a few minutes later to tell us that the cook decided not to start cooking yet. Just about 20 min later we found out that unfortunately our 3rd party wasn't going to make it at all. We asked the waiter to cancel one of the placed entrees and go ahead to cook our two entrees. The waiter said \"I can't cancel the 3rd one, you HAVE to order it.\" I explained that we would not need it, the waiter immediately said \"do you want to speak to the manager about this?\" The manager who came to the table was a snotty, rude and arrogant 20+ year old kid who explained to us that once an order has been placed it cannot be cancelled. I asked if the entree had been cooked already and he said \"no\", but that it still could not be cancelled. I explained once again that only the two of us would eat, and his response was \"the third order has to be cooked, if you don't want to eat it that's your choice.\" When I responded with \"So if i don't eat it, I certainly wouldn't have to pay for it, right?\" he said \"Of course you have to pay for it, whether you eat it or not. You ordered it, and we will cook it and you will pay for it. It's your choice to eat it or not.\" Outrageous! We ended up asking for all three entrees to go, and seriously were asked when paying for it if we needed change or if the rest would be a tip. Absolutely horrific experience all in all. This place has been going down over the years. First they eliminated modifications to their meals (forget to remove blue cheese from a steak even though you may be deadly allergic to it.. guess you have to eat something else). Then they added cork fee to the menu (yes, you buy a bottle of wine and they add $20 --- TWENTY dollars to the bottle price for walking to your table with the bottle and to open it for you), recently they decided to (I guess depending on how business is going that particular night) force a gratuity on ANY size party of $20 or more. I frequently dine out and have recommended this place to colleagues and friends. Needless to say I will do the opposite from now on. Avoid this place at all costs... I can assure you it won't last no longer than another year with these rules in place (unless they can pawn off burger and fries to the visitors of the next door strip club). Too bad a negative rating isn't possible here..................",
