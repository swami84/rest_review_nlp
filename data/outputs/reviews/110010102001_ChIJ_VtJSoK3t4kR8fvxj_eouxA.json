We left the orange juice in their fridge so it could stay cold. We paid $14 and waited. After ten minutes, the man starts asking us if we wanted lettuce, tomato, and cheese... on our breakfast sandwiches?? So we questioned him and he was adamant that it was no longer breakfast and he could make us sandwiches. We requested our money back and the man was still adamant that he could make us sandwiches but we wanted breakfast and our money back. The man finally got the hint we want breakfast sandwiches (what we initially paid for) and tells us to wait, he'll go make the eggs. At this point we were beyond frustrated and demanded our money back. We said to give us our money back for the sandwiches and the orange juice. Then the man said we had taken the orange juice. I was beyond frustrated and pointed at their fridge reminding them how we left it so it could stay cold. Finally, the man translates to another man on the register in a different language and only gives us $10 back. On the menu displayed, coffee was listed at $1.50. So here we go again, I argued with the man saying it should be $12 back instead of ten. The coffee certainly didn't taste like Starbucks (a coffee I would spend $4 or more on). Beware of this quick service, count and calculate for yourself the total. They love swindling tourist!",

        "caption": "Short of food poisoning, it was one of the worst cafes I've been to.  When I asked for a coffee he looked at his co-worker, chatted a bit, then appeared to know nothing about how to make coffee. The coffee machine was half on so he microwaved it - once I passed it to him.  The \"chicken Alfredo\" looked completely different when it came out and was probably pork. The cream sauce felt like it was cream mixed with water - or some kind of revolutionary material designed to remove all flavour. It was also mostly cold.  The food photo examples in the cafe look like stock photos - a world away from what you get.  The soundtrack of a computer gambling machine hums a sweet tone as the hustle and bustle of addicts buying tickets adds to the cosmopolitan feel I was hoping for.  A light at the end of the tunnel is they have what looks like fresh ingredients for sandwiches, so they are hopefully better.",

Today, I order a cup of chicken dumpling soup, it was undercooked, AND I ordered the last piece of red velvet cake--it tasted old and VERY dry. So disappointing!",
