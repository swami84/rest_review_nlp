My wife and I split the sausage pizza which is made on focaccia. It is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. It hit different for all the right reasons. I normally prefer thin crust (NY style) but this made me reconsider things. My wife got the burrata and focaccia bread, and she enjoyed it a lot. Joe chatted with us for a bit which was also really great. How often does a restaurant owner chat with their guests? We will be back for sure. Support your local businesses. Go Stags.",

However, as good as the food was, it was expensive for the portions given. You're paying the prize of a large pizza for their personal sized pizza. The meatball appetizer runs $2.75 per meatball; they're just regular sized meatballs. But again, the food was very good, and while we didn't leave stuffed, we left content.",

Started with a little vino (Planeta Rose):Strawberries, hibiscus and Rhubarb,  slightly tart with a mild sweetness.  No after taste.  One of the other guests had JD &Ginger Beer. Very good also.  Ordered the Bocce Focaccia.  Joe Benney's reminds me of one of the smaller gemstones you find in San Diego  or Oakland.  The place is alive with verbal discourse,  pleasant surprise I may add. I am not disappointed so far. The meatballs with Focaccia bread was amazing enough to savor and went well with the wine. I am confused that another person disparaged the meatballs so flippantly.  I will say I have to strongly disagree with your Assessment!  I really like Joe Benney; he was teasing someone at the Bar about letting a work of art (sandwich) get cold. Great food is meant to be eaten upon its creation. The feast has arrived,  oh my the spiciness is reaching to all of my tastebuds,  they are tingling my palate is a-flutter with the amazing mixture of spices.  One can not do justice in describing the meal other than ,Yes!Yes!  It is taking away my headache and causing me to breathe freely.  The sound around me is reaching an amazing level of long term friends wanting to be heard and hear. This is another little gem to be savoured as one does a fine wine or an amazing fragrance that brings nothing but simple pleasure to one's spirit.  Please visit this amazing little treasure, you might actually enjoy it as I have.",

I'm putting myself out there by saying this, but this place has the best pizza that I've ever had! I'm generally not a pizza lover, but Joe Benny's did not disappoint at all. It's a totally unassuming place for the non-local like myself, but once you have a bite their delicious Sicilian Style pizza and an order of their famous meat balls to start",

There are only a few tables and if you don't get there when they open at 5, you will have to wait. We arrived at 5:15 and got the last table. Great spot in Little Italy that is walkable --albeit a long walk -- from the Inner Harbor hotels. You won't be disappointed.",

When we received our small styrofoam box it looked like bread you would have for an appetizer, mind you in the same size of a Chinese food to-go box. It was really pathetic.. After speaking with the owner Joe Benny about how me and my wife were disappointed with what happened, he started defending his staff like we were the problem. Also, I'm not just saying this but truly the food is nowhere near as good as some of these reviews claim. The funny part is the owner Joe Benny offered to give us a refund, he took our address down because he made some excuse about his registers. We never received anything. Real stand up guy running this place.. overall horrible experience",

People here are friendly, the mood is relaxed, and the food is honest. Joe will treat you like an old friend and Caleb is more than ready to open your first (and second, and third...they're $3 on Tuesdays) Moretti. Chances are good that you'll see the same cook in the kitchen that prepared your meal the last couple of times you ventured in. Consistency can be expected. Recipes are followed and respected. Start with a Sicilian salad (add arugula) and the Sloppy Rowe Meatballs. Pick whatever focaccia pizza appeals to you-they're all good- and settle in.  I'v never had a meal here that was anything less than spectacular. Joe Benny's is what happens when a person decides to open a restaurant for the sole purpose of sharing good food and good times without any pretense.",

Location was packed but the staff and other customers graciously worked to make room for our little group at the bar seating.  The Good Excellent Italian. Probably one of the top 5 in terms of the best pizza I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to consume.  The Bad Very limited seating and if it\u2019s busy be prepared to wait a bit (but it\u2019s worth the wait) There was limited parking in the area which I imagine is only worse on the weekends  Location A bit cramped with about 10 seats at the \u201cbar\u201d right in the entrance and a number of tables packed in behind that deeper in the restaurant. There\u2019s also a few tables out in front. All that said, the atmosphere is excellent. Food A good variety of simple Italian selections primarily focused on Sicilian style pizza and paninis. I tried the pizza and was impressed not only by the taste but also the presentation.  Staff & Service Very friendly staff that seem to take a lot of pride in their jobs. Will return next time I\u2019m in the Baltimore area.",

Anyways, our waiter, Caleb, was quick and knew the menu well. He suggested that they were known for pizza and meatballs, so that's what we ordered: a Carpi pizza and then the meatballs with the extra cheese sauce.  I think the meatballs were certainly tasty, but maybe a bit small. The sauce that came with it was really good though, excellent when used as dip for the bread that also came with the dish.  The main course, the pizza, was stellar! My wife said it was the best pizza she's ever had! It's got a nice thick and soft crust, with cheese hanging off of every bite. The cheese!! So much cheese!! The cheese is great!! If you like a no frills, straight up cheese and sauce pizza, go for the Carpi!  The only reason we're giving it 4 stars is because the bathroom was a bit dirty. Otherwise, 5 stars all the way!  Maybe they can clean up a bit in the bathroom area.",

They were huge and juicy. Harrison hero- He loves meatball subs and he loved this one the best. Really filling for an appetizer.  The Angie- we got this because we thought we tried enough meatballs and it was the perfect balance. Focaccia pizza was like having crust on every bite. Thick layer of mozzarella cheese, smokey prociutto, arugula balsamic salad on top. The flavors all matched and the focaccia was perfectly crunchy. I bet they're all this good.  Small place, a little stuffy, waited about 20 minutes for a table on Saturday night around 7pm. Friendly service. $$$",

The staff is friendly and inviting, the atmosphere is authentic and intimate, and the food is out of this world. That night we enjoyed the Sloppy Rowe, the Baltimore Foodie Focaccia, and the Joe Benny Panini. We were too full for dessert, but our nephew, who is a pastry chef, told us that the cream puffs are a must-have, so we will be going back. We live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, so that will be a 3 hour trip to a city we no longer have a reason to visit, but we will be going specifically for Joe Benny's. Especially, cannot wait to take our middle daughter, who is a big fan of the Italian food in Boston's North end here- no more trips to Boston!",

We had an amazingly fun experience and had to write a review immediately.  We walked in and it was hopping!  The place was being run by 4 staff members buzzing with activity yet we were greeted and welcomed by all of them.  The kitchen bar area was full so my wife and I shared an intimate table in the rear.  Joanne welcomed us and immediately set the table a poured some ice water.  She and my wife began talking and we learned that we had handfuls of friends and coworkers in common (Smalltimore).  We each had an Italian screwdriver \u2013 Vodka and blood orange soda.  We took some time with the menu and our drinks.   Joe, the owner/chef came over to introduce himself.  Warm and friendly, he shared his story of his dream to share the food of his family with the city of Baltimore.  His excitement and pride was contagious; we asked if Joe would order for us and serve up \u201cwhat he does best\u201d, he was more than happy to do so.  First up - The Sicilian Stack \u2013 Bright colorful green, red, purple, white of basil, tomato, eggplant, and mozzarella cheese; lightly drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and a touch of salt.  Like a colorful stack of pancakes you could cut a triangle from the top and get a bite of all of the fresh flavors.  Joe paired that with a glass of a light pino noir a perfect mix of flavor and texture when eaten together with the stack. Joe also served the Burrata \u2013 a fresh mozzarella with a firm outside and an internal creamy texture, another excellent pairing with the Pino.  The next course was Mimma\u2019s Meatballs \u2013 I\u2019m a carnivore, and I've had ground meats from as many cultures that I can.  I can attest that these are the best meatballs I've ever had.  The perfect blend of pork and beef, firm, yet delicate, even a tiny bit juicy; and the marinara!!  I usually find red sauce boring.  This is the eat with a spoon type of sauce; salty, sweet, tangy and hearty I sopped up every last bit with the excellent house bread. It paired wonderfully with a hefty, jammy Italian red.  For our main course - The Sammy  Focaccia \u2013 crispy and soft focaccia with a flavorful lightly oiled texture of garlic and salt topped with more fresh mozzarella and Italian speck which imparted a hint smokey bacon like flavor.  My wife called it quits but I ate every last bite! By this time some space at the kitchen bar opened up, we asked if we could have our after dinner drinks at the bar and the staff welcomed us.  My wife had an Italian Margarita, and I had the Blackeyed ? more finely crafted unique cocktails.  We spent some time hanging out and making friends.  The staff was very busy with a full house yet it didn't feel like they were \u201cworking\u201d.  It truly felt like I was a guest in a family\u2019s busy kitchen, and a family that liked each other and wanted to share their food and fun.  Without asking Joe served us what looked like chocolate gelato.  But it wasn't it was something ten times better it was Maria Rita\u2019s Bianco e Nero.  A desert of delicate cream puffs coated in chocolate hazelnut cream.  Amazing! Sometimes I eat at places and I can taste the care in people\u2019s food!  I can taste love and effort at Joe Benny\u2019s.  Baltimore take care Joe Benny\u2019s and his family staff.  They will surely take care of you.",
