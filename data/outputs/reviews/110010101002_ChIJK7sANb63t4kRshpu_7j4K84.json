I'm not too familiar with places to eat downtown so I found this place through Google maps. The place is nice and spacious. Upon entering, there is a menu board to the right. There's a big selection of omelets. So I ordered the Spinach omelet with homefries and wheat toast. The omlete was great. Nice and fluffy with a good amount of provolone cheese and spinach. The \"homefries\" were anything but. The fries were deep fried like they were making french fried and tossed in grilled peppers and onions. They were bite sized for a toddler. I like traditional chunky homefries. They also do catering and the platters I saw for pick up looked pretty good. I came here around 8:30 and the place is nice and quiet. So I would probably eat  here again but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

Napkins weren't even enough to keep my hands clean after. The burger also had no structure. The patty started falling apart as soon as I bit into it. I ended up eating the peices of patty seperately at one point.  Fries were very soggy. Not even a hint of crispness on any, not even the fries that turned brown as they were over cooked.  Overall the food tasted good, minus all the grease hence 2 stars.  I was quite surprised to see the praise they got from different organizations. They must of catered their food just for the review.

Their menu mostly consists of sandwiches, and then some other rice-based dishes, curries, burgers, quesadillas, and other random stuff (\"globally inspired street food\" is what I believe they coin their fare). I go for the sandwiches; can't really say I've had a bad one there. They have one of the best tasting Bahn Mi sandwiches that I've found in the downtown area. Their Kentucky and Italian sandwiches are also favorites of mine too. Fantastic fries too!  My only two complaints are the price and service. For a simple sandwich, it's pretty expensive. You're going to be hard pressed to walk out of there without spending at least 10 dollars on one, and then it's more if you get a curry or platter instead. I'm glad they have a deal to add fries to any entree for just a dollar, but still, I could go over to Potbelly, Pret, or even Subway and get a sandwich that's only slightly less good for 4 bucks less. Service can be kind of lackluster when it's busy too. I've had times where I've stood there for 15+ minutes waiting for them to call out my order. For whatever reason whenever it's busy, their system of keeping track of orders seems to flounder as my order gets lost like 1/5 times I show up on a busy day, which means I wait even longer to get my food.  Luckily it's tasty, so I don't mind too much, but I would eat here every day if it wasn't quite so pricey.",

Service is pretty efficient, though everything is made to order separately so it can often take ten minutes to get your food, but it comes fresh and hot and there's always a ton of it. The kentucky chicken sandwich, the banh mi, and the cheesesteaks are all delicious and usually more than I can eat. For another 3 bucks over a Potbelly's sandwich, it's well worth it. One of the better K Street/Golden Triangle counter serve lunch places for sure. There's a lot of space to eat inside but it can get crowded and it's usually pretty loud at its peak. It also has terrific sidewalk seating that's in the shade after about 1pm in the summer.",

With a focus on international street food, G Street takes a variety of eats from a variety of cuisines to feed the hungry denizens of the local businesses.  During breakfast they serve quick and easy egg sandwiches with a variety of additions (as well as some other breakfast options such as eggs/omelets)  At lunch they offers a wider selection of sandwiches and other platters from all over.  I have tried the Alpine Panini and the Ham and Brie -- both are super basic in concept (meat and cheese), but the magic they worked on the sandwich is what really sets this place apart.  The sauteed onions provided a sweet accent that worked wonders with the salty prosciutto and cheese.  I highly recommend giving G Street Food a shot -- with a wide selection of options and healthy portions you cant go wrong.",
