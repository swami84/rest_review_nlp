Then 15 minutes before a server came back to the table. There were 5 other people at 3 other tables at the time.  Finally order placed. 20 minutes later we asked where our food was. No follow-up. 8-10 min later our food comes out, it's room temp, not cooked to order and items missing. At that point we just wanted to eat and get out so we let it go. We finish our meal, stack our plates and place them in on obvious place to signal that we're done and more than 10 min went by before anyone came back. At this point there is only one 4 top inside and our 2 top. We ask for the bill finally and it's messed up.  That takes another 10 min to unravel. Now we're just certainly visibly irritated so pretty sure they just stopped trying at all, which wasn't all different from the rest of our experience there.  All in our plan for a quick 30 min meal took over an hour. Oh, and it ain't cheap.",

The Crabby Wife is a great place to start if you're new to this spot, especially if you're from out of town and want a touch of New Orleans cuisine in your Brunch (Creole Slammer fits that profile as well). Great portion size on the Chicken and Waffles (the Waffles tasting absolutely delightful), and I enjoyed some excellent Po-Boys there as well if you're looking for more of a Lunch option!",

This time we waited for over 40 minutes before we received our food, all while watching tables around us be seated, order, eat and leave.  At no point did our waitress, who never gave her name, come over to ask if we needed anything, to apologize or offer any kind of explanation.  She finally brought  out half of our food, never apologizing, just saying that there was only one waffle iron working.  She brought out the rest of the food and forgot the hasbrowns my boyfriend's daughter ordered and again never apologized, she simply said, oh if you want hash brown's too?  She never offered to refill water or check on us while we ate.  She was clearly having a bad day, but that was no reason to take it out on us.",

During brunch, we split the Crabby Wife and the cornbread waffle with beef on it. Tons of flavor and huge portions. I also had a bloody mary--tasty without being pretentious, and just the right amount of spice--followed by an iced cannon to go (gotta love NOLA!), which was strong, creamy, and wonderful. At breakfast, we split a fruit parfait (gorgeous presentation and absolutely delicious) and their BEC breakfast sandwich, piled high on a delectable marble rye. Good coffee, too. My only complaint is the service. During brunch, they were busy (which I totally understand), but the people seated next to us (one foot away) got waters, menus, and drinks before we got anything. Luckily a really friendly gentleman with salt-and-pepper hair (the owner?) noticed fairly quickly and promptly took our order immediately thereafter. Breakfast was a whole different story. When we walked in there were literally two tables of people in the entire restaurant, both of whom had already been served. No one greeted us (though both the female servers looked straight at us), so we finally just took a seat. 10 MINUTES LATER we were begrudgingly given menus, and coffee took another 15 minutes even though we asked for it when given menus. Note that another table of people who arrived after us were seated, given menus/coffee, and had their food DELIVERED before we even got our coffee. Unacceptable and inexcusable!!! Overall, I'd give five stars for food but only 2-3 stars for service.",

I traveled to New Orleans to visit family this weekend and on our way out we decided to take advantage of a good southern breakfast. We always choose a new restaurant to try when we come in.  My mom, sister, two daughters and I decided on \u201cHorns\u201d.We had to put our name down for a 30 to 45 min wait but we were super ok with that because usually when you have a line out here it just means it\u2019s worth the wait. Well not this time.  We were seated by the most wonderful gentleman and quickly introduced us to our waitresses. After taking our order, she brought over our drinks first. The glasses we received were not the ones we fell in love with when we walked in the door. This was why we ordered the mimosas. It was so beautifully sitting on another customer\u2019s table. We asked her if she had given us a different drink by mistake. She advised us that the bar tender stated that it was that same amount of liquid in this glass as the other and she would not give us the other glass. Perplexed at this we asked why. She stated that she did not know why. We asked if she could provide us with the drinks we requested. She urgently took the drinks back to the bar. About 30 secs later the bar tender brought the empty glasses we asked for to our table and poured the liquid from the other glass into them. Waisting liquid on my mother as she poured with a agitated look on her face. We were flabbergasted and also floored.... at her dramatic display of aggression. She then slammed the glass on the table with a hard thud. We were disoriented at this but we understand that at times in customer service you get tired so we were going to let it go. However, when my sister looked at her glass she saw things floating in it. She gestured to our waitress to return to the table and showed her what she had found. This made me want to inspect my glass as well. Upon review, it was full of grease and grit as well. It looked as if it was taken out of the sink and placed on our table without a rinse or wash at all. This was the last straw. I calmly stood up and told my family \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d. I brought the glass to the bar and politely stated \u201c this glass\u201d as I placed it on the bar with a loud thud, \u201cis dirty. It is full of grease and grit. We are leaving, thank you.\u201d I turned and walked away.  This was by far the worst experience we have ever had in all of our visits to New Orleans. The way we were treated was unwarranted and appalling. The service you receive has a huge part to play on how well you view the whole meal experience.  My advise is to never visit this restaurant. With employees like this, what should we think of the owners?",

Their hash browns are delicious and crunchy   The only food issue was the grits, which were overcooked and lacked flavor.  The service was seriously lacking and even moreso than normal.  It took nearly 20 minutes to order our food and I finally had to address a server to pay our bill.  It wasn't busy, the staff just appeared disorganized.  If you have plenty of time to kill their lack of service should not be a problem.",

My partner had a traditional breakfast of eggs, bacon and pancakes, which he loved, while I opted for the French toast, which was fantastic. The coffee was also really good, and served in lovely rustic homemade mugs. The prices were very reasonable too. If we returned to NOLA we\u2019d definitely eat here again.  There was also a totally adorable cat wandering around outside who belonged to one of the staff members, who was up for a good fuss!",

In the meantime a couple decide to plop themselves down in the empty table outside while they waited to get in. But the waitress was on the ball, noted that we were first on the list and politely informed them they would have to vacate. Good for us! Once seated, the service was flawless. The food came out pretty quick. The waitress checked up on us and asked if we needed anything. I said \"Yeah, a flyswatter would be nice.\" She laughed it off like it was a joke. But quite seriously, other cafes around New Orleans do not have a problem with leaving a flyswatter in plain sight. If I could have quickly taken care of the 4 huge flys that were obviously regular patrons of the establishment, it certainly would have made for a much more peaceful breakfast experience. Still when you walk away feeling slightly high because the food was so good, can't let a minor irritation like that take a notch off a 5 star revue.",

The next day, I re-ordered something we had had the previous day, The Savory Breakfast. This time, it gave me food poisoning (and I have a really strong stomach, this was the first time I've ever gotten food poisoning). This also happened to be the day that I was traveling home, a journey of about 11 hours total with layovers,  which was not fun, to say the least.  I have to say, regardless of the food quality, the service here is incredible, which is why I can't justify giving it fewer than three stars. Maybe just don't order the Savory Breakfast when you go.",

After being seated server took drink order and when it arrived my wife's glass was chipped on the rim. The server then came back to the table after 15 min and apologized for the delay but food would be out shortly. Eventually after another 15/20 minutes our food arrived. We had ordered from the menu with no substitutions and it had taken over half an our to arrive and almost everything on our plates was cold. I will admit I didn't complain to server at the time as the thought of sitting there for another half an hour to get food replaced wasn't viable. Oh and btw my wife's plate was also chipped which may be a cultural thing Im not sure. I got fed up waiting for a check I went into the restaurant to pay and even that seemed to be a challenge. My advice,, go to iHop, food is comparable, cheaper and quicker",

However, today, September 24, 2017, my wife and I where treated very rudley and unprofessionally from the owner. I was on crutches from a surgery less than a week ago and was just coming to eat breakfast after attending church and was craving Horn's. While I was crutching my way up the sidewalk, my wife went to reserve us a seat and put our names on the wait list, as we have always done. The hostess at the door said if we wanted to sit outside, to go ahead and grab an open table and not to sign the wait list. The owner came outside, approached us, and asked us very rudely if we had put our names on the wait list and my wife explained what the hostess said. The owner rudely walked off and said she would correct her hostess for allowing us to sit down. She then apologized to some women who complained that we sat down before her. Maybe the women didn't ask if her party could sit outside, or maybe the owner needs to do a better job in training her staff to all be on the same page. No matter what, local or tourist, no customer should be treated the way the owner treated us. Good food, great atmosphere, great service from the wait staff. There is a way to speak to people and this was not it. I guess some owners forget that us locals are the ones that pay the bills when they first open their business. Very, very disappointed and will never return. My wife and I deserve a hell of a lot more respect than what was given. Will make sure we let the people we refer to Horns know about today's poor performance By THE OWNER.",
