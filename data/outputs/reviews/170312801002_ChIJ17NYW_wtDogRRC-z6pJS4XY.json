Our server Cara was incredible! Very knowledgeable with all the spirits they had to offer. We decided to order off their new sushi menu offered by Jinsei Motto, and I could not be more impressed. Chef Patrick and Andrew went above and beyond in terms of quality and creativity. Every single item was absolutely sensational. I can\u2019t imagine going anywhere else for sushi after this experience. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Thanks again to everyone at CH and Jinsei Motto for making this an unforgettable dining experience! I cannot wait to return again and again!",

Imagine a Chicago where sushi is epicurean art, and not just some spicy tuna roll that looks like a tactical flashlight burglars use to crack safes. Each piece of nigiri crafted for you pays homage to timeless tradition, while flexing Chicago grit and pride at the same time. The menu is nimble and often changes based on Jinsei Motto\u2019s ability to procure the finest ingredients for the day. This is broad-shoulder, never-miss-a-day-of-work sushi. This is sushi that belongs in the big leagues with famous names from Japan, NYC, LA....but proudly humble like the City of Chicago where Jinsei Motto was born.  Simply put, it\u2019s amazing.",
