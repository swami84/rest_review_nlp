I must admit the oxtails were really good however the catfish was too heavily seasoned in that it completely overpowered the fish itself. Another note is the Friday bar staff beware! During my last visit at 2:45pm I came in with a friend, we both ordered take out and made it absolutely clear that we were making separate orders with separate checks. I paid with my card and my friend paid in cash. The next day I noticed that my card had been charged separately for both orders. I returned to this establishment and spoke with the manager his response was that my friend did not pay his check so the bar server decided to charge my card for his order. I saw my friend pay his bill in cash and he left a $12.00 tip. So I have major problems here, first my card was ran after I left. How is this even possible if card information does not store in restaurants once a transaction is complete. This says to me that the bar server obviously copied my card information. It is also obvious that the bar server kept the cash from my friend with the assumption that I would not notice the charge. Be careful because the bar server on Friday will steal you credit card information. And the manager is an empty suit who did nothing but accuse me of having a dishonest friend. However if he would have reviewed the camera footage he would see my friend pay cash for his check. The staff is dishonest an unaccomadating. So check you balance if you use your card at Ja Grill you might realize that you have been charged multiple times. Ja Grill seems to add charges to your card even when you are not there!",

It was quite busy and others were standing with us but we didn't wait long for a table we selected. The atmosphere was festive.  Our service was great and the waiters and servers took time to make sure we were okay from ordering to refilling our glasses of beverage. Everyone in my party of 5 had more than enough to eat and we all took to-go containers home. I had the delicious curry shrimp. My friend even received a large slice of rum cake that was warm in the center and we all shared the delectable dessert. Since 3 out of 5 traveled from Northwest Indiana we thought is was a great place to eat! It was all good and I will definitely be back!",

They finally came with the food, asked for Soda atleast twice, took long to even bring a drink. The bill came for $76, I gave $80 and walked out. The waiter came to us saying \" we can have our $4 back, that $4 will not do anything for him\" With the poor service I did not even want to give a tip. Only for the waiter to come outside to give the $4 back. Stay away from this place. Extremely disappointed",

I ordered the jerk catfish which they let me order mild with the  hotter sauce on the side. The fish was melt in my mouth wonderful! The sides were okay however the portions were small. My friend had some kind of chicken which she liked a lot again the portion was small. Waitress was not very attentive but nice enough. Since the place was quite crowded I'm giving her a pass.

Waiter and waitress. I couldnt have any because I\u2019m expecting. So I ordered a virgin drink. I don\u2019t know why I expected something good. They, very obviously use CANNED JUICE. Gross gross gross. I sent it back and my husband suggested I have a Sherley Temple. One of my faves: 7 Up with a splash of cherry. Our waitress brought that and it tasted horrible. Like straight sewage. I had to spit it out! Clean the machine or get a new one people! How can you not have decent drinks with a full bar? Now during this time we\u2019d already ordered our entrees and ended up waiting a VERY LONG TIME!! I know it was crowded BUT we waited almost an hour for TWO plates! The food was okay but not authentic Jamaican. The rice was bland. The cabbage we enjoyed most. The catfish could be grilled instead of baked. It was OK. I tried my husbands jerk chicken and it was BLAND. Hardly any smoked flavor to say it was grilled! At the very end of our meal I still wanted something to drink so I ordered a \u201cbottled\u201d soda. It was GREAT. Lol.  And I left still hungry after a close to $40 bill. I could\u2019ve cooked a  perfect meal at home. Yes, on Mother\u2019s Day. Eating out these days never satisfy. \ud83d\ude1e if we eat out it\u2019s because I dont feel like cooking and sadly,  I always expect the food to be better than what I prepare. I really can\u2019t stand spending money on restaurant food that\u2019s average.",

I had made a reservation to avoid any delay but I had to wait at least ten minutes for a table. Although there was a table that had a reservation sign, I was told that was not my table. Once the hostess came back I was seated in the tightest area. The guests next to our table had to literally get up, in order for us to sit down. Once we sat down we noticed the table wasn't clean & sticky. Me & my husband proceeded to look at each other in disgust!! The final straw is when we both noticed each other trying to get food that we had stepped in that was on the floor, off of our shoes. After that we proceeded to leave. The host did ask what was wrong & we explained to her our issue. I wasn't going to elaborate on the issue because as I said previously I had a pleasant experience at Ja'Grill, but I got a email stating that I hadn't showed up for my reservation; which is UNTRUE. I also have the email where it says I was there & confirmed & was seated. This angered me because it was totally false!!!",

I took my dad some jerk chicken and bread pudding, he said the jerk was ok but loved the bread pudding as well. I'm disappointed that they have a limited selection of sides. I'm not a big rice eater so now when I go, I just order appetizets. The real reason I go is for the rum punch. There's no shortage of liquor in that drink and if you sit at the bar, the bartender pours you up right. I like the friendly atmosphere at this place. The service is good as well.

Would never ever spending $20 on this \"Signature Dish\" if you going prepare Oxtails before time, fine, but they should never ever ever be microwaved,  how disappointed, disgusting and disrespectful to the Oxtails. Oxtails should put in a pressure cooker, microwaving it drys them out and when they cool off, they will harden.",

I ordered the oxtail stew because it was a signature dish and had been recommended.  the stew  consists of a very thick gravy.  now I no why.  the oxtail are so small hardly any meat and tons of day.  the flavor was okay.  not as good as my mothers.  the place was sooo loud.  i toughed it out as I was having a meal with someone hadn't seen in a while.  I was still hungry at the conclusion if my meal and ordered the bread pudding.  big mistake .  it was good but not worth eight dollars.  with my meal dessert and tip my bill was 35 dollars.  not even remotely worth it.  Will not be back.  the server was okay .  ambience.  if you like a loud place  can barely hear yourself and not too concerned about your food then you'll be fine.   I should've taken my 35 dollars to say wildfire restaurant.",

She said Herb Kent was her father. Extremely friendly she got us a table within five minutes. It was very busy the entire place was packed. We were very impressed with speed in which we were seated. We were a party of five. The server came over quickly and took our drink orders. From this point things went down hill quickly. It took forever to get our appetizers. And there was more than thirty minutes between the time we were done with the 1st course and the arrival of the 2nd course. I had the lamb chops medium rare they were the best I've eve had. Someone else ordered them medium and they came out well done and warm not pipping hot. The  entrees came out over a 15 minute period not all together as the should. The jerk chicken was dry. Not enjoyable at all. The server seemed to be in the weeds all night. To sum things up the rum punch was good. My  lamb chops were great unlike my girlfriends. This place is loud and busy and that was fine, in fact I liked that. The service left much to be desired. The kitchen needs more consistency with the foods that they put out everything should be hot and taste the same. Maybe it was a bad night. Perhaps we'll give them another shot.",
