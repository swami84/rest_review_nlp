We were given an hour window for its arrival and told it was on its way when we called after 75 minutes. When we inquired 2 hours after we ordered, we were told it had been delivered. The delivery guy left it on our stoop in the snow and neither called, rang the doorbell, nor knocked; I was sitting right next to the door. While I understand delivery guys can be late, it is cruel and incompetent to leave food out where it freezes or can get stolen. Their flavor profiles seemed promising, but the experience ordering from here was so traumatic that I'm not sure I could do it again. Order with PLENTY of time to spare, but I'm not sure what to advise in terms of discerning that it's been delivered and sitting for an hour in the snow. I'm starting to wonder if they were messing w us for ordering on Seamless (I saw later on their website that they use another online service). Maybe they'll be nicer if customers use that.",

The food was fresh and complex and wonderful, and the service was gracious.  Go here if you love great spice, but if you're squeamish you should go anyway because they are very accommodating.

Today I was feeling like Indian food and instead of going to a takeout I wanted to try out different things. I have tried some of the Indian dishes before, even though I don't remember exact names, taste was familiar and I could recognize some of them. The food was quite bland/overcooked it seemed that it was sitting there since the opening. When I came in there was a couple and usually that's an indicator that something might be wrong with the place. The server really tried to be as nice as possible, he kept coming to check if I need some water and brought some bread (which was only thing that I really liked since it was fresh). There was another guy, my guess he was a chief, he had some radio on his phone that was really loud and he was walking around, then he started to talk really loudly with someone at the back and it just felt like I don't even exist for him. I left feeling full but not satisfied with the food, it just filled me up, that's all.",

After we were done with the food, I was served the bill without an itemized breakdown. I felt it was too high for what we had ordered. My request to show the itemized bill was received coldly. What I found out though was they had overcharged me by about 50% by adding items I never ordered. Anyone visiting them should carefully look into the bill before paying.  2) During my second visit, they were stingy serving the bread, which is not served in the buffet area but brought to the table upon request.",
