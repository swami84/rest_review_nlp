I ordered the pumpkin soup and saw what looked like was an eyelash in my soup but could have possibly been pumpkin pulp so I asked the waitress to send it back. One waiter said it was not a hair but our waitress said she didn't want to take any chances and sent it back for a new one. The soup itself was delicious. The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because when I got my burger, it had coleslaw on top and I could tell that the coleslaw was not fresh it was a bit wilted and kind of brown looking. I was just expecting something very fresh and crunchy but it wasn't. That's not to say it still wasn't delicious because it was I just would have liked for a fresh coleslaw. Another thing too is... I'm not sure if the bathrooms were under construction but there was only one public restroom for the restaurant and it was literally a single toilet and sink so there was a line to use the restroom too.",

The only negative I could render is that this is a high-end establishment with extremely excellent waiters and waitresses, highly trained, everything works like clockwork!

I ordered the carrot soup which was great. The eggplant garbanzo bean dish ... I love eggplant - not so much in this dish - very chewy/tough. Maybe it was an off day?  Maybe it is just me. The beans though, they were really, really good. I'm not a big garbanzo bean fan, but these were GREAT.  I did order the sorbet. I had just read that this place has best ice cream in the Loop. They also offered pumpkin spice ice cream. (I hate pumpkin spice and wish the obsession would die NOW.) Anyway, the mango sorbet was good, presentation was GREAT.  Staff is great. Service was terrific. The waiter and assistants were very attentive. Hostess was very welcoming and helpful.",

At all.  In my opinion, the bartenders are the best part of Atwood. Full of conversation, interesting stories, etc. The cocktails are great. The food - a little overpriced, but I\u2019m not complaining, it\u2019s good food! Price is typical for downtown Chicago, especially being a block from Millenium Park.  I\u2019ve been coming here for years and ever since Pineapple acquired Atwood all has seemed to go down hill. Atwood used to be full of smiles (employees and customers) and the food was really fantastic...Pricey, but fantastic. Ever since Pineapple acquired this property from Kimpton, the management (not staff) have not up to par. They are no where near what they used to be. The managers of Atwood now have a high turnover (I see this because im a somewhat regular), they are condescending to the staff, and don\u2019t really seem to care about the customer - the most important part! It makes me not want to return. Wishing Kimpton would reacquire.",

We shared the smoked trout dip with seasoned crackers. The dip was tangy and tasty and delightfully sprinkled with tiny chive slices. The crackers  were crispy yet a little too salty. The crab cake sandwich was large and delicious, although I didn't realize it would be breaded and fried. The avocado serving was plentiful. The brioche roll was tasty and rich. Greens served with a side of golden mustard salad dressing were crisp and fresh. We shared the chocolate cake for dessert. It was moist and the icing rich and decadent, but I don't see the point of the enormous slice and it cost $14. Overall, a pleasant experience with decent food and great service.",

Still, the hostess said it would be 15 minutes, so we waited...and waited. When I politely inquired after 45 minutes, I was told it would be another half hour. The two-top next to where we we're sitting was empty the whole time and there were several empty tables. I realize they need to accommodate their reservations, but they should have been more forthcoming about the wait or be more organized about the seating. Fortunately, there's a nice Mediterranean place right next door.",

It was nothing spectacular. I ordered the endive salad and strip loin for my meal. The salad was fine (although under dressed). My strip loin was supposed to be medium rare, but showed up much closer to medium well/well done. It was nearly inedible and the rest of the dish was nothing special, lightly dressed white beans with plan arugula sprinkled on top.  After dinner the server offered dessert menus, but again had no idea which desserts could be made gluten free. He again had to check with the kitchen. I ordered the panna cotta, which was actually absolute heaven. It is the only reason I've given this restaurant 2 stars. Maybe just go here for dessert?  During our trip this was the second most expensive place we dined (after Roister and only because we got wine there). It definitely was not worth the overall expense.",

One in our party was explicit about a gluten allergy and went through the menu with the waiter. When breakfast was finally brought to the table the potatoes where found to not be gluten free after a bite of them had already been consumed. He was very flippant about the mistake and joked that \"I hope ur not celiac\". Lucky for the restaurant that wasn't the case. I was shocked to see the check come without the meal served to the allergic party removed and comped or even discounted. I asked to speak to the manager who was apparently too busy with the 6 patrons total in the restaurant to come over. The waiter did remove the meal after my request and pointing out why it should be. The manager should consider taking the time e to come and interact with his customers. He may find that he has created an unfriendly and uninviting environment with a smile free culture.

I believe change can be the mark of an enterprising, imaginative and venturesome dining venture.  The Atwood is where I take out of town guests and important people (twice this week in fact) and everyone I have taken there has raved about the cuisine, the service and the relaxing environment.  I love the latest venture into creative menu selections and just the right amount of food for lunch and for dinner.  I love there being nothing on the menu that is routine or extraneous and much that is surprising. I love the emphasis on healthy and fresh ingredients.  I love the prices.  It's what one would expect of a top-level dining experience but not outrageous, which is what takes place at some top-level dining locations.  The service is always gracious, never rushed and there is always a convivial tone to the room.  Finally, the Burnham Hotel has its own unique ambience and sense of both history and comfort, and love bringing friends to dine there.",

For a $17 salad at lunch, you would expect that it would at least have enough greens on it to satisfy the title of \"Entree\". However, the salad was more of an appetizer. The service was also unsatisfactory. Our server was rude and had the audacity to charge us for a birthday cake item he served us, which we did not even request. I mean we had mentioned it was our friends birthday but there was no further discussion about it. The lunch was over $100 for two salads, a sandwich, a couple beers and a desert item we didn't even order. I can safely say that I will not be coming back, nor will I suggest this disappointment of a \"restaurant\" to any of my peers.",

        "caption": "My boyfriend and I ate here at the end of the summer...he was about to go away for a few weeks for work and we wanted to celebrate by going somewhere nice.  Atwood Cafe was the perfect choice...the atmosphere was elegant but relaxed, and the service was superb.  Our server, Sang, was excellent.  He was attentive and knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and even hooked us up with a taste of one of the appetizers and a sample of dessert wine because he knew it was a special occasion.  I follow a mainly vegan diet with occasional exceptions, so while there was a vegetarian option, I decided to splurge and get the scallops because I knew the quality would be great (and I was right).  My boyfriend got the pike, which was also delicious.  We ordered a couple of cocktails and an appetizer of fried brussels sprouts while we were waiting for our entrees...maybe not the healthiest way to get in some cruciferous veggies, but probably one of the tastiest!  Atwood Cafe definitely gets it right when it comes to quality over quantity.  I love a good deal and some leftovers to take home as much as the next person, but sometimes you're looking for an overall dining experience, and that's what you get here.  The portions may be on the small side, but everything is so rich and flavorful that you end up completely satisfied.",

        "caption": "Our dining experience at the Atwood Cafe last Saturday evening was beyond exceptional.  I found the Atwood on OpenTable and I had been looking forward to taking a step back in time for quite a while.  Our server Giovanni was charming, warm, enthusiastic, and knowledgable--he transformed cocktails and an early dinner into a magical evening-length affair!  Giovanni did not simply spew at us descriptions of ingredients and preparations that were obviously spoon fed to everyone during a pre-shift meeting.  Instead, he engaged with us and with the menu offering spot on recommendations throughout our meal.  I did not hesitate for a moment to relinquish all decision making responsibilities to Giovanni, and I am glad I did!!  He also paced our meal beautifully, a rare skill during a busy weekend service.  (Bravo to the whole team for that!)  The manager that evening, Kelly, was also a delight.  Not only did she stop by the table to check on us, but she stayed to chat!  We enjoyed a great conversation that was authentic and unhurried, another rare treat from a restaurant manager in downtown Chicago.  The impeccable service was the perfect pairing for the unbelievably GREAT food.  The new Fall menu is creative, dynamic, and very satisfying.  Favorite moments included the pickled mustard seeds on the pheasant crespella, lamb carpaccio, and curried cauliflower.  Wow.  I can't wait to come back.",

We also ordered the Mac n Cheese which at first I was a bit skeptical of after reading what it was made with on the menu but we were quite pleasantly surprised after we started eating it. I won't go into what it was made with but all I got to say is you'll have to try it. It will knock your socks off. The salmon that came with the Japanese Breakfast was a more than sufficient portion for me that we carried it home for leftovers. And the scallops were excellent. Sorry I didn't take any photos but the presentation was quite excellent as well. I guess that's an excuse to go back.",

Just three blocks away, the Atwood is across from Macys and right next to Nordstroms Rack.  There was only one vegetarian/vegan choice on the menu, a spicy lentil dish, and it was delicious and well presented. The pot au creme was one of the nicer desserts I have had in Chicago as well.  Our server was polite without being cloying, and the atmosphere is fun--kind of a theater set of late nouveau meets early deco. The seating was a little cramped, and because so few restaurants are open for dinner in the Loop, the place was pretty packed. Nevertheless, service was good.  I would recommend it for a pre-theater dinner.  A nice dinner for two was about $100 with cocktails.",
