You will not believe that the burger is 100% plant based - both the cheese and the patty tasted like the real thing! The \"meat\" is perfectly charred and I liked that the burger was loaded with grilled onions. The potato buns are also chewy and dense. 10/10 would eat again. We also got a side of tots, which were really good dipped in their sriracha aioli, and a strawberry shake which is made with soy milk and was creamy and very indulgent! Knocked down a star because the service was on the slower side. But all in all, we appreciated the quality of the food and the fun and energetic diner vibes.",
