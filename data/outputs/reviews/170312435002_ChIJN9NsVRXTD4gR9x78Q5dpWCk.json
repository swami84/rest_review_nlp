Choose from a quinoa bowl, ciabatta sandwich, or rice paper wrap, then add your protein! Options include, spicy garlic shrimp, basil crab cakes, tofu, Thai bbq pork, Korean cheesesteak, and chicken teriyaki katsu.  Chicken Teriyaki Katsu Wrap: Japanese style bread crumb chicken breast, house coleslaw, teriyaki sauce  Thai BBQ (Mu Ping) Zenwich: Thai style roasted pork belly, shredded carrots, daikon, cucumber, red onion, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, with homemade tangy sweet aioli on ciabatta bread  We also tried the Korean Cheese Steak Quinoa bowl! I could eat this all day long! The melty mozzarella on top of the marinated brisket  For sides we got the house coleslaw, cucumber salad, and truffle fries. Don't sleep on these sides, they definitely exceeded our expectations!",
