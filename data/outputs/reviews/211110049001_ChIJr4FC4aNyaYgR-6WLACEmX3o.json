Yep as suspected that was my bag sitting there getting cold.  Asked about utensils since I'm staying at a hotel.  She responded yep there in the bag... which was sealed.  Get back to my room and there's no utensils in bag, food slightly warm, and both steaks overcooked.  Flavor and quality of the steaks were good besides being overdone.  Wouldn't recommend for the money. Service was very lacking. Going to Jeff Ruby's next time.",

        "caption": "Me and my boyfriend went to this place Friday night to celebrate our anniversary. We had a long day at work, and wanted to unwind and celebrate with a nice bottle of wine . My boyfriend has been to this place before, but it was my first time . Worst experience ever. My boyfriend was being friendly and just talking to the hostess about how we had just moved up the street, and that we\u2019ve tried all of the restaurants in the area, but he hasn\u2019t been to this one in a while and he wanted me to try it . The hostess basically rolled his eyes and told him that he would get us seated shortly. We waited for about 10 minutes, and a table next to the bar became available so we sat there until we could get a regular table . My boyfriend told the bartender that he already knew what kind of wine he wanted and to go ahead and bring it to us, so we could drink it while waiting for our table . She said ok, then my boyfriend asked the hostess how much longer it would be for our table and he said one would be available shortly because they were at their max capacity. So we continued to wait at the table by the bar . While thinking we were waiting on a bottle of wine, apparently the hostess and bartender got together and complained to the general manager about serving us alcohol.  She came to our table and told us that she was happy to seat us but we couldn\u2019t have any alcohol because the staff were \u201cconcerned \u201c like are you kidding me ? The staff couldn\u2019t handle someone talking to them and having a normal conversation? My boyfriend told the general manager that we haven\u2019t drank in almost 6 weeks because we were getting into health and working out, so he didn\u2019t drank a drop of liquor that night. She looked him up and down and said \u201ccongratulations but like I said, no alcohol \u201c. Me and him just looked at each other very confused. I was just over it at the point and said it\u2019s fine let\u2019s just go get seated and order dinner. We sat down and the waitress gave us menus , then I saw the hostess walk over and whisper something in his ear . I\u2019m assuming he told him not to serve us alcohol too since the waitress didn\u2019t bother giving us a wine list . At that point we were both embarrassed and felt completely unwelcome and just decided to leave . The rude hostess didn\u2019t say have a good night or anything. He just looked at us sideways with a smirk like he was glad we were leaving. We ended up going to Jeff Ruby\u2019s up the street and felt WAY more welcome. The food was great and they were happy to serve us the 2 bottles of wine that we ordered, one was to take home .I will NEVER spend my money or allow my boyfriend to spend his in this place EVER!! We ordered a well worth it $730 meal at Jeff Ruby\u2019s , where we were appreciated ! Too bad Morton\u2019s lost a great potential regular customer. I\u2019d give zero stars if I could.",

My husband and I called Morton's to see if they were open and to see if we needed to make a reservation. We were told no and that they have seats available.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a Brian who was so uninviting.  He sat us in the back of the restaurant by the bar and when we asked if we could have a table in the actual dining area we were told they were full. Mind you there was only us and 1 other couple in the WHOLE restaurant. When we told him that we were gonna leave because of how we are being treated he just looked at us and answered a phone call. When he answered we over heard him say our first reservation is a 8 pm. How ironic is that when we arrived at 5pm. We feel that we were judged off our \"Looks\" as soon as we walked through the door. So just know if you look like US you may not get the same treatment as the next person.",

I'd become aware of an advertised \"deal\" on a three-course meal from a limited menu but the real draw was the bottle of Daou \"The Pessimist\" at $36.00! I couldn't resist it. So made a reservation and was joined by a friend. It was a Sunday evening so parking on the street right in front of the restaurant was available and free. Upon entering the building, I was surprised to discover the restaurant was down a level in what I would usually think of as the \"basement\". It required going down a flight of narrow and somewhat steep stairs. If there was an elevator, I didn't see it. We managed just fine. But, I could see it being an issue for elderly or those with mobility problems.",

At first glance it was great to see the chefs working and food being placed on the ledge to be served.  However, it then turned very ugly and unprofessional.  We witnessed one of the chefs and the staff constantly arguing for the entire two-hour period we were there.  This atmosphere was certainly not pleasing.  It took a long time to get our main course (steaks, sides, etc.) Since we were sitting so close to the kitchen we were able to see when our food was put on the ledge to be served (Nicole was back there waiting).  Unfortunately, it sat on the ledge for nearly twenty minutes (not sure why \u2013 kitchen seemed very confused) and we watched our steaks be taken off the plate and thrown back into the oven two separate times.  Needless to say, when our food was delivered:  (i) my husband\u2019s filet did not come with the Oscar topping as ordered so it had to be returned, and (ii) my filet came covered in a shallot butter sauce (which is not how I ordered it) (and the lady who served it to me said something like \u201coh, you\u2019ll love it\u201d).  No, I didn\u2019t love it.  If I liked a shallot butter sauce I would have ordered it that way.  It was very disappointing that she did not even offer to take it back.  As the steaks sat on the ledge for so long so did the sides and they were not hot when they were served.  It was our first time to dine at Morton's and our last.  I would not recommend.",

The staff was absolutely lovely (shout out to our server, Courtney: she was professional but fun and made excellent recommendations, very good at her job!), I never saw anyone who looked angry or impatient. The busser stayed on top of everything, as well, and was very nice. We were greeted by Patrick, and he was also very hospitable and upbeat; he made us feel quite welcome for our first visit! The food blew us away. Indescribable. The steak was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned; the best steak we have ever had. The au gratin potatoes and Brussels sprouts were top notch, and the portions were big enough we took half of each home. The lobster bisque and Caesar salad were both absolutely perfect, and the layer cake was just exquisite. We will be back!",

The 4 course dinner was Amazing and the Service was Beyond Great,  they treated us like Family and were oh so friendly. Just a Wonderful and Overall Fantastic experience from the servers all the way down to the gentleman that parked my car at their Valet parking station. Their Customer Service is the Best. My only complaint was how long the wait time was between each part of the meal, but then I realized that I was with a party of nearly 50 people if not more and it takes time to prepare food for that many people as well as the Customers who were not in our Party that were dining in that evening.",

As soon as we walked in and told the host our name for our reservation, he congratulated us on our anniversary. We were seated at a private booth that already had our names printed on it! Next thing we knew, our host had taken a picture of us which he later turned into a nice printed keepsake for us to take home. And this was before we even met our server and got to the food! Ryan was an excellent server, very knowledgeable on the menu and very personable. We went with a lot of his recommendations and we are glad we did! The lobster bisque, filet, crab cakes, sides and desserts were all delicious--it's really hard to go wrong! Make sure you try the cream corn, truffle fries and the molten chocolate cake! We stayed until close to closing and never felt rushed. Ryan took great care of us, boxed up our leftovers, and made the whole evening a joy. Other servers also stopped by to check on us and congratulate us for the special occasion as well. They work really well as a team and we never felt neglected or overlooked. We will definitely be back, and you should definitely come here! If he's working, ask for Ryan!",

However, delay in service and missing attention to the basics has left me wondering if the juice is worth the squeeze ($$$). Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly and professional  ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and we were seated right away and were accommodated with a booth instead of a table. Our waiter was friendly and took our drink orders right away. There were a few other parties already seated but it was packed. We didn\u2019t get our bar drinks for a while and we were told they are running behind at the bar (there was only one party in the bar area) and again it wasn\u2019t packed. The manger brought us our bar drinks. I got one of the seasonal drinks and it was terrific and I thought it was worth the wait. Other parties began to arrive and the time between seeing our waiting and getting our bread, food or being check on by our waiter grew  longer and longer. It became noticeable that parties that had arrived after us were getting service before us (for example bar drinks). We hadn\u2019t gotten the bread that was offered to us but later parties had gotten their bread. When we did eventually  get bread it was served by another staff member not our waiter. Dinners were severed again to people who had come in after we did. I am familiar with cook times for food and so forth but the 12 - 16 oz steaks were coming out before our 6 oz rare and medium steaks. When we did get our steak it was not served with our lobster and again by yet a different another staff member  not our waiter.  When we asked where our lobster were of course they would have to check with our waiter. No one came back. The manger who brought our bar drinks out stop by to check on us and we told him we hadn\u2019t gotten our lobster. He said he would check on it but didn\u2019t come back. Right around the time we were finishing up our steaks and sides our waiter came over and apologized for the lobster not coming out yet but that he would check on it. After a little bit we got our lobster however already done with the rest of our dinner. Needless to say parties that came in after us ( who ordered larger steaks) had paid, left and were going on with the rest of their Friday evening. For most working people with children it\u2019s a lot of planning to have an evening out; getting a baby sitter, taking an Uber out and back to be disappointed. Was the juice worth the squeeze? I don\u2019t think it was.",

I don't mind paying for a good steak, but a $50 steak should be cooked perfect every time.  I wasn't about to send the steak back again so I just had it boxed up.  Their answer was a free dessert that my husband had ordered, didn't really make up for a very disapointing dinner and experience for me.  They dropped the ball on an opportunity to make a poor situation better.  We will stick with Jeff Rubys in the future.",

        "caption": "On Sunday we went to Morton's for my dad's 60th birthday celebration.  Overall the food was good though nothing special, but the steaks tasted burnt and didn't seem like they were seasoned.  Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn have much better tasting food for about a third of the price.  When I got home I noticed that they had charged an extra dollar for almost every item.  Part of my bill was split with my brother, so that's why many of the items have a 1/2 next to them, but you can tell the price is higher than what our menu listed.  On Tuesday, I called the restaurant and told them that I was charged more than what our menu said.  The manager told me that they raised prices because it was Derby weekend and that they wouldn't give me a credit.  Are you kidding me?!  Their prices are outrageous to begin with for what you get, but then they have the nerve to sneak in a price increase just because of the Derby and then don't honor the prices clearly listed on the menu.  It's greedy and unethical and possibly worse.  I'll never eat at Morton's again.  Update on 6-9-19:  One of the managers reached out to me to apologize for what happened and I was sent a gift card to make up for it.  I'm changing my review from one star to three stars since they were responsive and apologetic about the situation.",

The bacon wrapped scallops were wonderful and the cocktails terrific.  I ordered the bone in ribeye because that is my personal favorite cut.  The server told us about adders or Toppers for steak but my belief has always been a great steak should stand on its own.  The steak was ordered medium to medium rare and arrived more or less cooked that way, it did not however stand on its own flavor wise.  I do not know their prep process but it did not involve any flavoring of the steak.  The steak was bland and marbling was okay just not the caliber of meat I would have expected for the price.  I have had some tremendous steaks at some of the other high steak chains and would have to say I would eat here again but would not order a steak.",

I have never given such a low score based on just the food but it was just not worth the 250$ (gratuity not included) had 1 app and 2 sides 2 people. I would of gives 0 stars if not for the ambiance.

We had four servers for our group .Debbie was primary at our table. She was attentive and funny, but it was \"the little things\" that lead me to write this review.  My husband has been unable to use his hands for over four years which means I have to cut his food and feed him. Once she knew he needed a straw for everything he drank, no drink was brought out without a straw to go with it.  Debbie brought his steak for him to see, then whisked it back to the kitchen for the chef to cut it up.  Thanks to those\"small\" gestures, his coffee didn't taste like wine and I was able to eat with the group instead of spending so much time cutting two steaks. It made me feel a little more \"normal\" and a lot less stressed.  Derek (I think) was also in the room and he was a hoot--professional and fun! All four gave excellent service and I'm sorry I can't remember their names. Matt was the Mgr on duty and he was very kind.  Food was great. We will be back!",

Upon arrival we had to still wait for a table.  That should have been my first clue, to just leave. After a 20+ minute wait, we (6 people) were finally seated. We then had to wait for our server to attend the table. Our server, was very some timey.  Once we ordered our appetizers, which were ok, we then ordered our entrees. When we received our entrees, 3 orders were completely wrong. Our server, seemed like she had an attitude and then tried to say that she took the order correctly. I then spoke up and sternly corrected her, because I heard each and every order placed. She then took one plate back at a time, instead of all 3. She brought one plate back and all they did was wipe off the top of this $40+ steak and then made it well, well done. So now, it had to go back again.  Then she brought out the other $40-$60 steaks and they were just ok. On top of that, the side dishes were cold. When the server was informed, again she got an attitude. Brought them back, however all they did was scoop old food on top of what was sent back prior. This is now the 3rd time management came over, but that was just a show from her position. Finally when the last of the steaks were delivered to the table. It was better. One of my party members ended up, spitting up in her plate, by mistake. Of course, she excused herself from the table and went to the restroom. Upon her return she had put a napkin on top of her plate and did mention to our server what happened. You couldn't see it or smell anything.  So, this ignorant server goes and tells someone in the kitchen that my party threw all up in the plate and some guy comes up to our table in front of everyone, including other patrons in long black plastic gloves, acting like my party had Ebola or something. Very embarrassing, to say the least. The server then came and bagged our food, which we didnt even want, but puts the bags on the floor. Really?!? Nasty. The manager only took off steak and some sides. She should have done a lot more than that!! Then too make things worse, the valet had the nerve to charge us for parking, after spending that much money. No sign even indicated there was a fee.  So, he comes and stands at our window looking for his money. To be a high priced restaurant, you have the nerve to charge for valet!! Outrageous!!!! I would not recommend this place to NOBODY AT ANY TIME!!! The food is definitely NOT worth $800!!! Very disappointed!!! Very disappointed!!!",

So if you could let me know that be awesome. It was locked in a glass shelf and want to say $200 a shot or more. Again, great place loved it and son can't quit talking about the huge icecream he got.",

We were a party of 10, so I somewhat understand, but still...  The table did receive complimentary shrimp cocktail for the wait, and honestly it was my favorite part of the meal.  Food was served just barely warm; the crab cake was burned; the bacon around the bacon wrapped scallops was dry and chewy to the point of being inedible; and the beefsteak tomato salad was definitely not a beefsteak tomato.  The worst part was the dry aged bone in steak.  It was fully one third bone and inedible gristle.  In their defense, we didn't say anything during our evening because we were still enjoying  a great night out with friends, but we definitely won't be returning.  I w",

If 4.5 were possible I believe that would be a closer rating.  Atmosphere was nice, dimly lit, and created an all-around intimate experience.  Server was friendly and knowledgeable, aiding us in our wine selection and advising us of portion sizes with a recommendation for sharing salad course and a single side to split. I'll say those were spot on; the split salad was the proper portion and a single side is certainly plenty, but I'll get to the side in a bit.  Wife and I both had filets which were cooked to our preference (rare) with absolute perfection. It truly made the dining experience!  The single detractor from the evening was the 'twice-baked' au gratin potatoes. It seems customary at most upscale dining establishments to not include salt/pepper on the table as the food is properly seasoned and needs no changes, a decision proven correct at every other similar class restaurant I've dined at and certainly not the case here. Aside from a topping of cheese, the potatoes were devoid of any significant flavor. The addition of salt was a help but by far they were the least enjoyable part of the dining experience.  Bottom line we will definitely done here again but will under no circumstances try the twice baked au gratin potatoes!",

And on top of that a server did not come to refresh our drinks and water. After our complaints Restaurant Manager offered 20%.

Then our main entrees took another 30-40 minutes to arrive after our salads.  I asked to have my entree and dessert bagged up to go right when I received my salad.  I was told at that point it would be 10 minutes to get my food.  After 15minutes,  I asked again and was told another 5 minutes.  After another 15 minutes, when other members of my party (who ordered after I did) began to receive their entrees,  the leader of the event asked about my food.  She was told it was being bagged up.  Someone else's bag then came out. It was another 10 minutes before I received my food.  40 minutes later than my salad.  And the key lime pie was awful.  Not worth the hassle",
