It has this light and fluffy taste to it where it\u2019s not overpowering.  This is a no tipping restaurant, which working in the industry for years, was quite shocking. We decided to leave a tip anyways, we\u2019re all living during hard times.  Can\u2019t wait to go back and try more things on the menu!

It\u2019s 2021, I think it\u2019s time people start having a mind of their own, an opinion of their own based on their own experiences not based on what other people say. This place was amazing.

It's very tough not to order the burrata pizza after you've tasted it for the first time. The tomatoes are incredible in taste and simplicity. The sourdough is addictive and special.  The onion pizza with Za'atar is a great choice if you like to order plates with different flavor profiles. The leeks were really good and we had a very fresh salad with tomatillo sauce that was quite special.  The menu is short and focused, but it will give you a hard time to decide what you will have to try on your next visit  They have a really interesting and thoughtful wine list. In two visits, we have received really good recommendations to pair with our food choices, including Las Ondas \"Levantamuertos\", which is so good that I ended up looking for it online. Definitely, a \"Can't wait to go back\" restaurant, in an area that's getting very interesting culturally.",
