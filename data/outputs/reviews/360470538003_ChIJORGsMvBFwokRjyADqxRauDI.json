When my dog developed stomach issues they would hook up special meals for her that were within the guidelines of what she could have. I'll never forget them for that reason alone but the cherry on the pie is that Mom really likes their food, too.",

I love to order an assortment of individual nigiri and sashimi pieces so that I can sample each taste.  This place is usually pretty empty, so it is great if you like some peace and tranquility as you eat. I have spent several hours in this restaurant just slowly eating and chatting with my friends.  I have also gotten a lot of takeout from this place, especially since covid 19 shut everything down. They are always timely with my deliveries, and have not gotten an order wrong with me.  The food here is inexpensive as well, and when you order sushi like I do, those dollars and cents start to add up very quickly!",

It was a millipede crawling all over the sushi and rolls inside the still-sealed container. It was one of the most disgusting sights I've ever seen and I completely lost my appetite. When I called to complain the woman pretended to not understand English enough to register what I was complaining about. When they put someone else on the phone and I was able to make him understand, he said it was \"not possible\" - I explained that I was looking at it and it was most certainly possible, he still refused to address my complaint.
