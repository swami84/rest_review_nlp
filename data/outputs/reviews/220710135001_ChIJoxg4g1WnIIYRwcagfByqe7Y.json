It was not terribly busy when we ate there, and they made lots of time to engage genuinely with my 5 year old son. We all had such a memorable experience. The ambiance is excellent for a range of scenarios from a family dinner to a romantic outing. It's a pleasant atmosphere and, of course, the food was delightful. We ordered the vegetarian platter and fried eggplant and I just wished we could transport Cleo's to our home... a lot of complex complimentary flavors. Oh! The baba ghanouj has a wonderful smoky flavor... I use some faux smoke flavor in my own, so the authentically smoked mouth fill was awesome and is not something I've found elsewhere.",

What seem to me to be reasonable was a simple credit or a salad the next time I ordered, but nope! The owner accused the Uber driver of eating it and that I need to call Uber. He kept arguing with me saying, \" why should I have to apologize to you? I put the salad in the bag myself. It's not my problem.\" I can't believe that a business owner would be so rude and argumentative. Now I know the owner is lying by saying he personally put the salad in the bag; he didn't because someone wrote the order wrong so why would he put a salad in there when it wasn't on the handwritten ticket order? But as you all can see my order receipt on Uber. I'm too tired to go tonight but I will be going there tomorrow to call him a liar to his face.",

The sandwiches and hummus were good. The fries were okay, but not exceptional (they were shorter & chunkier and reminded us of the fries that come with a chicken tenders off a kid's menu).  Even though the hummus was pretty good, in hindsight we regretted ordering it. It was a regular-sized (a shallow bowl about 5-in in diameter) portion of chickpea hummus with four battered & deep-fried cauliflower florets on top. For $17 it was expensive (for comparison the blue crab topped hummus at Saba is $20, the whole head of roasted cauliflower with whipped goat cheese is $14 at Domenica). I was also slightly disappointed that the garlic sauce was not toum, but that's what I get for not asking. We had to ask for water a couple times, but it was extremely slow in the restaurant at that time of day and I don't expect the waiter to hover over us.  All that said, we will definitely be back here! The sandwiches were a good price for the quantity & quality and I'd like to try some of the entrees. There are few restaurants in the French Quarter with healthy and have vegan/vegetarian options. The interior decor is absolutely gorgeous. I'm pretty sure our server was in fact the owner and they were extremely friendly and gregarious. I really look forward to going back next time I'm downtown.",

Hoping for a good experience we stopped into this beautiful, welcoming restaurant. We immediately noticed the hospitality, definitely a strength of this restaurant. The decor was traditional And tasteful. The food was very good and service excellent in both speed and manner. We ordered the combination plate as I wanted to taste their preparation of this traditional dish. It was delicious and the portions were generous. The grilled Halloumi presented us a new take on an old favorite and I preferred it to the fried cheese served in oil that is commonly served in other places. The salad was actually better than at my home spot, all of the vegetables extremely fresh. The presentation was quite lovely much like you would expect at a high end restaurant yet the prices were quite reasonable. There were a number of dishes on the menu I would like to try, so I plan to come back.",

We got the hangover and dragonfruit mojito and both are a must. There pita breads are the best I\u2019ve ever had along with the falafel. Staff were so nice and genuine. Our waitress also gave me some extra juice because she knew I loved it. I highly recommend this restaurant!",
