Between the appetizers, food, and pastelitos, this place is the most authentic Cuban spot I've been to outside of Florida. Croquetas? Nailed it. Pastelitos de Guayaba? Nailed it. Nobody has those outside Miami! (Maybe one place in Manhattan, NYC).  Bottom line: if you're in Chicago and want real Cuban food, not American food masquerading as Cuban food, hit this place up.

We explained to Robert we had been waiting a very long time for our take out order, over an hour, he exclaimed with a sore attitude he was very busy; he proclaimed that excuse many times. After a few more attempts to find out why it was taking so long to get our orders, Robert braizingly called me an a$$wipe; WoW! We demanded a refund for our prepaid food at that point and Robert refused; and kept us hostage waiting for food. We saw almost every dine in customer happily recieve food while we were waiting, not to mention there were at least 4 drivers like Grubhub waiting as long for their food; those poor drivers were also treated similarly by Robert. Stay away from this place, Cuba probably treats their prisoners better than this joint treats their customers.",

The owner sits in the far back table talking as loud as possible with his buddies like he's some kind of Mob boss. He'll even come talk to you, tell you his life story and let you know about the half priced mojitos, which is weird because at half-off, they're still $7-9. So yes you're paying half off in the restuarant but any other place you'll get the $7-9 mojitos at Normal pricing.

For entrees we chose tilapia criolla, lech\u00f3n asado, y rabo encendido.  Side dishes ranged from yuca, congr\u00ed, arroz blanco y habichuelas negras.  We all shared because it was all sabroso!  For dessert we had flan and tres leches.  Not disappointed.  Liked the ambiance and service.  Spent over two hours there and went fast.  Highly recommended.  Authentic, tasty, friendly staff.
