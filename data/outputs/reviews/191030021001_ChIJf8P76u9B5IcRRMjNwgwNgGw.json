While we love to celebrate any special occasion with Baroncini because the food is so delicious, the pricing makes it a great option for any night out. The chef is incredibly talented, you can tell he loves what he does. The food is always made with such wonderful and fresh ingredients. They have an excellent wine list and the waitstaff is always very professional and well versed on the menu. The restaurant itself is small and makes for a fun and intimate dinner.

My husband chose the four course and I ordered from the standard menu (apetizer, pasta, dessert). Our food was excellent. All dishes were beautifully plated, excellent flavor, and portions were nice as well. Prices were well within reason for the quality of the food.  Unfortunately, we were unluckily assigned to a horrible waiter and seated next to two of his friends that were dining right next to us. The waiter spent more time with his friends chatting, taking sips from their cocktails, and taking selfies with them than attending to others dining in his section. He told us he'd return with more bread but never brought it. I sat with an empty water glass (my only drink) during dessert. He never once checked in on us during any of our courses to see if we were okay or needed anything.  He was very immature and unprofessional as we had to listen to him discuss with his friends about trying to get another wait staff to take his section so he could leave early for New Year's Eve.  I want to love this restaurant because the food is excellent but I'm not sure I can handle returning a second time to be disappointed by another bad waitstaff experience.",

        "caption": "Upon arrival, I found the lack of a host station confusing. In its place... a coat rack that created quite the traffic jam with people trying to put their coats on while others were trying to enter and exit the restaurant. Pretty awkward layout decision, though slightly understandable given that Baroncini is a smallish place. Right away the host sat us and brought us waters. In fact the service was excellent from start to finish( that concludes all of the good things I can say about my experience at Baroncini) . Which brings me to the food; the food was simply a travesty. Like most Italian restaurants the meal starts with a basket of bread and some olive oil with cracked pepper. I cannot stress how disappointing this bread was. Stale and crumbling with no distinguishing flavor other than flour, this bread was on par with something you might find marked down at a local Cub Foods or HyVee. Truly a bad omen for an Italian restaurant of all places. For our appetizer we ordered a simple caprese bruschetta which wasn\u2019t good but was by far the best tasting thing we had all night. Again the bread was questionable. Three thin, floppy bruschettas with melted mozzarella and halved cherry tomatoes, olive oil and some basaltic reduction. In all my life I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had such a floppy bruschetta, not appetizing and honestly, very wimpy. Next we had two simple house salads, which aside from the scallops were the grossest dishes of the evening . The lettuce was not fresh and the bits of carrot added a wetness that no one ever wants. Strange decision to add a heap of what tasted like canned chickpeas on top. The salad also had a few cherry tomatoes that looked and tasted like someone sliced them the previous day (they had that pale, gelatinous quality that tomatoes get when cut open and left to absorb the fridge air, you may have had a salad like this at the airport for example). Finally, the entrees, which we waited for approximately 20 mins. When they arrived the plates were hot on top which typically indicates that our food had been sitting under heat lamps for some time. Not a great sign. We ordered the linguini and the scallops. The linguini pasta was actually pretty good, nice texture and felt homemade. I would have found the linguini quite tasty if it had not been salted to death and the shrimp not over cooked. I needed my water refilled mid dish due to the epic salt levels. Sad really. Next the scallops. Typically the quality of a scallop dish comes down to not over or under cooking them. These scallops were basically raw. Surprisingly that didn\u2019t bother me as much as the flavorless butternut squash pur\u00e9e on top of an even more flavorless leek (I think?) pur\u00e9e. We each had three or four bites and that was all me could muster. Determined to end our experience on a positive note, we ordered dessert. We chose the panna cotta. In retrospect we should have ordered a more fool proof dessert but.... we didn\u2019t. The panna cotta was essentially white jello with a raspberry drizzle and whip cream. It\u2019s perhaps unfair to say it was like jello when only the top three quarters was jello-like( or an undercooked scallop..) the very bottom portion had that creamy texture you look for in a good pana cotta. The total cost of the meal was approximately $120 for two very disappointed people. In conclusion, the service was excellent and the food was an utter failure. I would go as far as to say the kitchen staff did an adequate job executing what I would call very bad recipes. Sadly I will not be returning to Baroncini though I wish them the best and hope the menu sees BIG changes soon.",

After searching for the wine we ordered, the server determined they were out of it.  There is a coat rack in the way of the entrance and no host station at the front.  Instead the \"host station\" was directly next to our table, so the host was on the phone taking reservations which frequently interrupted our conversations.  The food was so so, I found the pasta with truffle cream sauce to be largely tasteless and no salt or pepper on the table to adjust flavor.  The chocolate \"discs\" dessert had a very unappealing texture.  To garner these prices, I believe the restaurant should up their game--including adding touches like fancy soap in the bathroom (not Method), cleaning the top of the bathroom garbage can, and rearranging seating/host station to improve comfort for guests.",

Overall, food is high quality and is served up to look very classy and at a speed to help you enjoy time with good company. It is a small place, and gets cramped when they are busy.  Although I try to be accommodating and patient, I did not feel welcome here as a vegan. I was told the only vegan option was a bowl of elbow noodles with marinara sauce. I asked them to mix in some vegetables for more flavor, but when the dish arrived it was missing the vegetables and had so much excess salt, that is was inedible. While I waited for a new dish, I was not offered anything to snack on. My colleagues all finished their meals before I was given a corrected dish. When it did arrive, it was not at all filling and it looked like a kid's meal next to the elegant dishes of my coworkers. This while experience was frustrating and disappointing.",

I can\u2019t believe its been there for 6 years and I\u2019ve just now heard of it. If you haven't; either you need to try it. Immediately upon entry the decor was warm and inviting, elegant without being stuffy. I guess you could even say romantic. We were greeted warmly and throughout the evening our service was spectacular. I just love an engaged and knowledgeable wait staff. It\u2019s not often a salad makes one of my reviews because if a salad is not included with my meal I usually don\u2019t order one. Theirs was not and my wife wanted to try one so we ordered their panzanella salad Traditional Italian bread salad with bread, tomato, onion, spinach, extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar and basil. I know salads are usually \u201clight\u201d even with the bread it was super light and refreshing. It has now joined the list of just two or three places  that I can think of I\u2019ll make an exception for where I will order a salad. Usually when I try a new restaurant I rely heavily on the recommendation of the staff and when for I asked our server what they were known and what was her favorite the first thing out of her mouth was the ANGNOLOTTI DI CARNE now I still can't pronounce it but she was able to roll it off her lips like she grew up in Italy my reply was I\u2019ll have what she said. It consisted of  a house made agnolotti pasta stuffed with beef and parmesan in a light sage and brown butter sauce. She had me at brown butter surprisingly it was the hint of sage that was the star of the dish. I was able to steal a few bites of my wife\u2019s  LASAGNE ALLA BOLOGNESE  which was like no other Lasagne I\u2019ve ever had as it had a crunchy panko type topping which provided a textural difference rarely found in a lasagne. I always get excited when a review contains the words \u201cI had the best ever\u201d Baroncini Ristorante Italiano\u2019s TORTA AL MASCARPONE cheesecake is hands down the best cheesecake I\u2019ve ever had. It was the perfect balance of tart and sweet. Caramelizing the mascarpone was absolutely brilliant, it was like the most decadent creme brulee you\u2019ll ever meet or eat but it was cheesecake! The fresh berries and strawberry sauce added a freshness to this amazing dessert. The meals I remember the most are the ones where my stomach is just plain happy afterwards and mine was happy for hours after leaving Baroncini Ristorante Italiano. I think I also had a restaurant first as when we were leaving one of the staff said ciao!  We can't\u2019 wait to return, if for nothing else the mascarpone cheese cake",

Nice place though, just maybe not my style.  I got the ravioli. It was really good. I was starving when I went in and sometimes places like this, you'll get 5 small pieces and you're dying of hunger still. These were decent size and satisfied me.

I had the seafood chowder to start and it was not salted at all. It was however bearable in contrast to my main course of the scallops and potato risotto. The potatoes were composed mainly of pancetta chunks, making the dish unbelievably salty and inedible. My boyfriend ordered the veal porterhouse which was charred on the outside and raw on the inside. It was almost 90% fat, making his dish inedible as well. On top of that, they charged 30% gratuity for lackluster service. We told them it was our anniversary and they did not bring out anything complimentary or ask if they could do anything special. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment. The food was underwhelming and the prices were exorbitant. Ruined our evening.",

When they arrived they were cooked unevenly and tough as heck. The vegetables were cold and over cooked. The lobster was marginal at best, however the pasta was cooked perfectly. This is second time I've eaten here. The service is spotty but well intentioned.",

The lentil-butternut squash portion of the dish didn't do it for me either. For the price, it was definitely not worth it.",

Smoked salmon with caviar with olive oil and then a delightful dish of linguine with mussels, shrimp, small scallops, calamari and red sauce.  As if that was not more than enough Chunghi, the gracious enabler that she is, ordered an unusual warm flan with spinach and a chocolate mousse with a raspberry sauce at the bottom.  What a treat and a bargain for such a delicious luncheon menu.",
