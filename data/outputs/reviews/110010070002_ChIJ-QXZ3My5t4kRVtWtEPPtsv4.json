And when I made plans to pick the order up the next day, they were clueless. Here's a tip for sushi hachi-Don't use an online ordering service if you are unresponsive and don't have access to a phone line. Horrible experience.

Tried to call the restaurant and saw them decline the call through the window. I'll be charging back.  I was lucky to have the free time on a nice night but I feel bad for the app delivery drivers.

We had the Prime Beef to start (similar to wagyu) and is accompanied by a superheated rock so you can prepare it to your liking table side. The beef was good - not A5 wagyu level, but definitely top filet or sirloin - and served with three condiments which we loved. The truffle salt is AMAZING. I've had truffle salts before but this is done with a good amount of truffle oil flavor. The other two sauces are also very good, though I think I preferred the steak as-is after salting it on both sides with the truffle salt.  We also got the Cucumber Avocado Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Capitol (specialty) rolls (one of each). I liked the Capitol roll best but not giving 5 stars because I didn't think the sushi was any better than average - and the Capitol roll (which is tempura) was just barely warm when it was served.  Overall great experience and will return for the prime beef, though we may skip the sushi next time.",

I've only ordered their sushi rolls, so I can't speak to their other dishes (which look great also). Their rolls are $6-7 for 6 pieces for their classic rolls and 4 pieces for their speciality rolls. They have all the classics- spicy tuna/salmon, tuna/salmon avocado, eel, yellowtail, crunchy shrimp tempura. My favorites are the eel and yellowtail; the yellowtail roll has a really fresh jalapeno pico de gallo on top. I also really love their Hachi and Dragon speciality rolls!  Service was great and the ambiance was very clean and nice. Would highly highly recommend checking Sushi Hachi our for some great sushi and Japanese food :)",

Even though he was chatting with a customer; it was very clear that we were not welcomed there. No hello, wait just a second, or someone will be right with you. We were treated like invisible brown people. My cousin and I walked out. We will not pour our money into people who can't show respect that we even exist.",

I arrived after 2:30pm when many restaurant kitchens are closed. These guys stay open all day and the place was as empty as you would expect. Waitress seated me, poured some water and answered a few questions. I ordered a green tea, the chicken karage and spicy tuna sushi then ended with matcha green tea ice cream. My bill was $33 including a 20% tip.  The spicy sushi was ok - not very flavorful but it was fresh and pleasant with ripe avocado and good, sticky rice. The chicken karage is fried in a light flour batter and frankly would have been better in a panko crumb but hey maybe that is how karages are made everywhere?! The thick creamy sauce combined with the oil from the fried chicken was a little much for me. Of course, I still had dessert.  The green tea ice cream comes with three scoops and it\u2019s really creamy, not bitter like matcha can be. This is that rare opportunity when eating the Maraschino cherry makes sense.  Enjoy the easy listening versions of great metal and funk classics that they play in the background here. Thriller, Daddy Cool, Sweet Child O Mine, Live N Let Die and more sung breathily by a very sweet sounding young lady supported by a cast of pan pipes and synthesizers. Wow.",

The sushi is super fresh and the menu has more than just sushi on it if you're looking for non-fish options.  When I worked in Arlington, I practically lived at Sushi Rock, which is a sibling restaurant to Hachi. Sushi Hachi is like Sushi Rock's older more traditional - but still cool - sibling. Serving authentic sushi with an innovative approach, Hachi is the perfect spot for date night or a night out with friends in Eastern Market. Diners can order a variety of dishes a la carte or the Omakase, which I highly recommend!  Service at Sushi Hachi has always been good when I've been, super friendly and accommodating. - \u2728&e Tip: Keep an eye on @GiltCity DC's deals, sometimes they offer the Omakase at Sushi Hachi for an incredible price!",

The ambience was very good and we were impressed by the technique to wash hands with wet tissue. It\u2019s a small white cylinder and the moment u put it in water it becomes a tissue, this was fun.  Coming to the food, the fish here was delicious and hot stone grill beef as well. It\u2019s a must try experience. I would recommend Chu Taro and Tuna. If you want to try multiple types of fishes try the chef tasting platter(sufficient for one person). You will not be disappointed. But it\u2019s a bit pricy though. Overall a great experience. And it\u2019s definitely worth a try.",

We kept a hold of our dishes and would be only half way through before the next dish would be set in front of us, they didn\u2019t wait for us to have finished. By the time it got to the Wagyu beef I couldn\u2019t even have one bite. It took them about 50 minutes to serve us 7 courses which didn\u2019t make for a relaxing evening. Once or twice I was going to ask for more time but I\u2019d look up for someones attention and they\u2019d be there with our next course already.  The first couple of dishes were nice, the tuna on the sashimi was cut incredibly thin to the point mine tore in two when picking it up with chopsticks.  I think I would go back and be sure to tell them to slow down next time, I also might not go for the omakase and just order when I\u2019m ready.",

Will definitely have to come back and order the sashimi I would normally order to get a better idea of the flavors of the sushi. Ordered the Chicken Kara-age, Wagyu Beef, Uni Roll with Quail Egg, and Futomaki Roll.  The good: Chicken Kara-age was good, as the chicken was tender while the batter was pretty crispy and flavorful. The Waygu Beef was good, and it had a nice taste with the sauce it was covered with. The Uni Roll and Quail Egg was quite delicious, but you have to request for a Quail Egg. Surprisingly, the Futomaki Roll was good. This is a roll I would rarely order because there's no fish in it, but I enjoyed it.  The bad: Wasn't anything wrong with the place, but it may be difficult to find parking since they only have street parking available.  Overall, the food was delicious, but I will have to return to access how the sushi is at this restaurant since I didn't really have the opportunity except for the Uni.",

More importantly, they only serve bluefin tuna as a tuna option. This is extremely unsustainable. They don't have any clear information on the origin of their seafood. Was very disappointed in the lack of awareness of the sustainability issues associated with seafood.",

Anyway, my wife and I came here this past weekend and the service and food are still amazing. We always try something new every time we come back. We tried several different beverages including the dreams come true, sexy lip, gentleman, Pearl, and the summer. All very different, but all very good...as well as strong.  For food, we tried the chicken-kara-age, grilled octopus too, chefs selection, blue crab tuna tartare, kimpachi crudo, roasted squash soap, mini chirashi sushi, octopus croquettes, ishiyaki waygu and lastly the Hachi charashi Sushi. Honestly, everything was amazing!  The restaurant itself is always kept clean and well maintained. Our server brought our food out to us quickly and correctly.  Their is street parking outside but it can sometimes be a pain to find someplace to park. Otherwise another great dinner at Sushi Hachi!",

Courteous, prompt, personalized attention - continuing throughout our meal without being intrusive. For example, her suggestions and clarifications on the composition and preparation of the evening's dishes, tactful guidance on dining customs, and assurance that our meal was presented in an appropriate order of dishes. We were certain she either owned or managed the restaurant. The food was wonderful - classic elements reassembled delicious combinations, with artful presentation. Our dining included the Miso soup of the day, edamame, wagyu beef Hachi style, grilled octopus / seaweed / spicy tuna, ginger,, a sushi roll and fresh draft Kirin beer.  The restaurant is fresh, classy but relaxed, with calming retro orchestral music.  It's worth your while to travel down 8th street to Sushi Hachi.",

The dishes we had were unique and the composition of each plate made sense and was in harmony. The fried chicken had nice and light breading without being oily. The sushi was well rolled, and the nigiri plate (pictured) I had was very fresh and all how I described above. Dessert (pictured) was excellent, we had the shaved ice and also represents what I said above. Beautiful presentation on all dishes.  Service: We had Nomon serving my wife and I this night. She was an absolute delight and was one of the best and most friendly waitresses we have ever had. The rest of the staff was very attentive and friendly as well.  Overall, as I said before, highly recommended. We will certainly come back if in this part of town again.",

The quality of the fish for the price is fantastic; we had a variety of sashimi (salmon, tuna, fatty tuna, and octopus) some rolls, and appetizers, and all were very high quality. The fatty tuna is the best I've found in DC at that price point. Our waiter Tony was attentive and helpful, and we were treated to free edamame and (to our surprise) they comped our bottle of wine for no reason.  I will be returning and bringing friends.",

I ordered omakase and the chef did a good job providing a diversity of dishes that all complemented each other. The fish was fresh and flavorful. Ambiance was a little loud but otherwise enjoyable.  Negatives: SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE. Although we had a 7pm reservation, we were left waiting for 15 minutes, until 715, despite seeing several open tables. This would ordinarily not bother me, but I witnessed several parties of the same size (2 people) who came after us were seated before we were. I was told twice that they were cleaning our table as we waited, no apology.  After being seated, everything was going smoothly until the smoked sashimi dish. We finished the course and waited 20 minutes until I had to flag a waitress that we hadn't receive our next course. She skipped the nigiri dish and brought out the soup. I informed her that the dishes were out of order, received no apology, she took back the soup, we waited another 10 minutes, finally got the nigiri, then she brought out a soup that was cold, which I assume was the original dish brought out by mistake... again no apology.  I'm usually very understanding when mixups happen but this was over the top. I won't be going back, which is a shame because the good itself was excellent and I love supporting new restaurant.",

We were seated 45 minutes after our reservation. Service was ABYSMAL. Dishes were forgotten, came out without sauces, sushi missing accompanying ginger, hot food occasionally lukewarm. Had to get up and ask for water or drink refills. Took about 2.5 hours for our 7-person party. Service issues seemed equally split between the kitchen and the servers.  Management apologized and comp'd our (rather significant) bar tab, but there are some serious issues at this place. Beware.",

Quality of fish here is noticeably a cut above other places, with silky toro, firm salmon, unctuous ankimo, all served with a mix of innovation but firmly grounded in traditional Japanese.  Toro handroll (classic traditional) was generous and amazing, timed to come out with the nori still crispy, and overall on par with top end places in NYC and SF.  A crab-truffle handroll (modern) was very good as well, with the crab marrying well with the truffle oil.  A special plug for the Chirashi, which was *very* generous with the fish, and artfully arranged (see picture).  The ikura was very freshly made, with tiny pearls of salmon egg that popped with briney flavor (instead of tough flabby skin that many other places have).  VERY happy to finally have a legit, upscale (non-BS-fusiony) Japanese place on Barracks Row that focuses on high end sushi/sashimi with a slight inventive flair.",
