I\u2019ve tried the Wicker Park Berry one and the Green Smoothie one and both have tasted quite powdery, syrupy, and overall much too sweet. I also have not been able to find a menu which lists the ingredients that are in their smoothies, so it is difficult to decide which ones I\u2019d like without understanding what fruit is being put into them. That said, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful and I have truly enjoyed chatting with them while waiting for my orders. I hope that they can reduce the artificial flavors in their smoothies so that I can visit more often!",
