Catfish was overly breaded and I had crumbled coarse cornmeal all over my table. Yams had a weird tangy taste and the Mac and cheese was salty like it was from a box. I was hoping for a good meal and received less than. I gave an extra star cause the food did come hot. I will wait a while but I'm not confident in them again enough to try them right away.",

They are very accommodating in that regard. If u don't want it hot they'll make it mild if you are a spicy fan u can tell them also. We also ordered crablegs and let me tell u I work at a seafood restaurant and I've never seen legs that big not even in the #1 dinner in Brooklyn.

The second visit I ordered Escovitch Snapper with Coconut Jasmine rice and collard greens.  The third visit I order garlic butter shrimp with collard greens and fresh salad.  I've also ordered by different modes.  First visit was in-person, second was uber eats and third was grubhub.  Immediately after placing my third order via grubhub, the restaurant called me to report they did not have fresh salad and inquired of another selection I would like.  I selected yams.  When I arrived for food that was ordered in, my order is always ready.  Food is prepared upon order (not just sitting around on hot table tops), warm, tasty and great portion sizes.  I had the liberty of meeting the order on my first and second business.  He's a very hard working, driven individual.  Satisfied Customer, Sheila Evans",
