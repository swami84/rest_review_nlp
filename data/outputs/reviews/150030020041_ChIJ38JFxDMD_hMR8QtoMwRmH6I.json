Our flight to Honolulu arrived late on 1/6/2020, we ended up going here to dine in but they said the restaurant/Mikawon will close within 10 minutes and that we can order take out if we are ok with it. We ordered two dishes to go, one noodle dish, the second is a tofu soup dish.  The total came to $33.40 for the to go order and we made the payment with our credit card. Last night 2/15, we checked our credit card bill and noticed this restaurant gave itself an $18 tip which we did not authorized.  We submitted a dispute with our credit card and awaiting to hear back from this restaurant what happened?  Fortunately we saved our receipt and have proof that we did not give an $18 tip for a to go order.  This is very upsetting so we will not be coming back here again even though we visit Hawaii often.  Remember to keep all your receipts and it might be a good idea to take a photo of the receipts you signed so that you can use as evidence.",

It can be said that there is no service at all. When you check out, the bill will be inexplicably increased by 20-25%. This is the highest tip I have in Hawaii in a week, usually 15- 20%. In fact, we are willing to pay a tip, but we have to decide how much to pay based on the quality of service, but they will not give you the right to choose, so it is so hard to add to the bill! The restaurant opened by the Koreans has a very light business. It is only after the checkout that the reason is clear and the quality of the food is average.

Cold noodle soup I thought it might be an off-the-shelf product, but it looks like the boss made it. The children eat deliciously. I am well satisfied with the local food. The kindness of the president also stood out.

A bit pricey but that's to be expected since that's how it is in Waikiki. Though to be fair the sizing of each dish is very big, so you're getting your money's worth. I went alone and that's usually fine but I recommend going with another person or more since the food fills you up. I also love the little drawings and written notes they laminate and post all over the walls, makes it feel more homey. You can also cook food on the built in table grill. I do suggest asking which items they have that's for grilling though since it doesn't clearly say on any of the menus",

He ordered hot soup, they brought hot soup. Different kind, but soup. Never mind. Who cares. Both times, wait was toooo long. We almost fell asleep over there. Then we found out that other people who came after us got their food already. Then I got my food. Then my husband got his. Ten minutes later. What do I do? Eat while it\u2019s hot or wait ten more minutes so we could eat together? Choices, choices... Not a big fan of that kind of service.",

However, since it is in Hawaii, it was the best among 3 or 4 Korean restaurants in Waikiki. If it's a tip, you have to include it in the food price or pay it separately, but it was good that I didn't blush to see how much to tip as the tip was included in the food price from the beginning. Also, the service was good, and the other Korean restaurant, KangxStyle, was delicious and good, but Migawon was the best I liked. I don't know when to come to Hawaii again, but I recommend it here. There are many signs of autographs and newlyweds by celebrities and athletes. The price seems to be the same everywhere in Korean restaurants. The rice or soup type seems to start from as low as 12 dollars.

Besides, I put a tip on it, but I didn't check it properly, so I came out to the store and asked why I wasn't leaving the tip. When I asked to see it again, I went back to check it out, and I thought I would say an apology. I just went because I didn't want to fight, but thanks to me, it was my worst memory during the trip. Those who wrote that it was delicious below seem to have a taste to admire every time they eat out in Korea. It is much better to go to the ABC store to eat and buy a bread or rice balls.

Even if you are late during the peak hours of your evening dinner, your smile will make you feel sorry for the food being late.  The facilities are not good, but the food tastes better than some Korean restaurants ...  I tried a lot of different types as a la carte, and it was all delicious I didn't eat the hotpot, so I ordered the seafood hotpot in a dubious way.  This time, there are only seafood hotpot photos ...  For reference, there are some people who say it is a group tourist restaurant, but in the evening when it was full, group tourists didn't see it.  There were a lot of families ... Maybe young people came to foreign countries Although I would eat with foreign food, travelers who come with adults and children come to Korea and prefer Korean food.  The price is not cheap ... ^^ I wanted to eat sizzling ribs, but it was expensive ... ^^  The food is very hard, so just for reference ... I won't regret it ...

We were seated quickly and my family and I were happy to wait after we had chose something from the menu.. until I noticed they gave other people and families cups and water within a few mins of being seated.  After 15-20 minutes, the man who seated us walked past us multiple times and avoided eye contact with us completely. There was one point where he was leaning against a bar standing there with pen and paper doing absolutely nothing. We tried to get his attention but he quickly turned busy taking orders from people who came at least 10-15 mins AFTER us. So we sat there waiting for another 20 minutes, while my family got impatient and were treated like a minority. No other waiters would acknowledge us either and would ignore us. One older waiter would look at us, and then look away and ignore us. After about 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave, when the older waiter finally walked up to us and asked \"Are you leaving? Are you leaving?\". He asked as he had already started taking the menus away from the table whilst half of my family was still seated at the table. But Yes, we were leaving. I should also include that the restaurant did not appear busy, and had a lot of empty tables. (I've noticed other people have had a similar experience).  Before we left, it had already been about 40 minutes of just sitting there without even being acknowledged. Rating this place solely based on the experience since we never even got the chance to taste the food. I hope that if my family and I returned to visit at some other time, we won't have the same experience.",

(Wasn't a line to get in, empty tables)And then you, the owner, yes Ms. I'm talking to you, you ignore me. I try politely to get your attention. You're busy, so you don't hear me. Is it because I'm white?!?  I watched as my take out box was looked over and over and over again as other orders were being served. I tried to talk to people, telling them I think that's my order. Nothing... Finally a young gentleman, didn't get his name but thank you, finally made eye contact with me... He informed you about me. About my order. Once you and the cook realized what happened, you chummed it. I got scraps and half assed food. I saw it all through the curtains. So thank you for the awesome customer experience and the slop job. I will tell all my tourists and friends to visit Me's BBQ on Uluniu St. It's cash only, closed on Sunday's, but they never forget their customers...and the food is better!! I can say this bc I've been to both now... Quality, taste, presentation with the colorful sides.. Me's BBQ. Hashtag that beaches #mesbbqwaikiki",
