I\u2019ve specifically been provided special hands on customer service from a representative by the name of Einym. She/he has gone above and beyond to service me and keep me happy. My food allergy concerns are always taken into consideration and also my food preferences. Whenever there\u2019s an issue with my food or the time it takes to be delivered, Einym has always prioritized my concerns and has provided me the most exceptional customer service I have ever received in my lifetime. Because of this amazing customer service alone, is the main reason why I have continued my meal plans with green life nyc. I can directly get in contact with Einym and Einym responds to me in a timely fashion and is always courteous, respectful, empathetic and professional. I am not sure if Einym\u2019s superiors understand how much of an asset he/she is but I can assure you, I value Einym\u2019s service and can\u2019t imagine dealing with anyone else. Einym should be considered for a promotion as I feel she has made an extreme impact on the company through individual effectiveness. Kudos to Einym. I thank Einym for all he/she has done for me and I look forward to continue doing business with this professional!",

According to them they have Late deliveries which makes it okay for you to eat breakfast at noon. NEVER AGAIN!",

I was nearly 220 pounds, an all-time high for me. Furthermore, my mother was diagnosed with diabetes \u2014 a disease that almost every family member of mine has battled. The news prompted me to get a physical done. It was during this physical I was notified of having an elevated a1c, in the pre-diabetic range. Shortly after being told this, I took charge of wanting \u2014 and needing \u2014 a healthier lifestyle. Since joining, I have lost nearly 30 pounds and have lowered my a1c levels. The Meals Very tasty and fresh. The basic plan includes three main course meals, along with two small snacks. The meals also come with a nutrition label that is extremely helpful for me, as I track my meals in the myfitnesspal app and share the insight with my dietitian on a bi-weekly schedule. Whenever I have a question regarding my order, the owners are quick to respond and maintain open communication. While I am not at my ideal weight and health, I know I am on the right path. For anyone looking to live a healthier life, don't think twice about trying this fantastic company! You won't regret it!",
