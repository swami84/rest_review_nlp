        "caption": "Pros: Good craft cocktails. Really nice views.  Cons: My husband and I were staying at the Ritz for five nights in celebration of our honeymoon. Although we did not have a reservation to eat here for dinner, we simply wanted to enjoy a cocktail. If you do not have a reservation here, you are treated like a second-class citizen.  The vibe was so strange and standoffish from the moment we arrived. As someone who has worked the front of house at a three Michelin star restaurant, I was flabbergasted by the lack of \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d skills and five-star hospitality.  The situation: we noticed the restaurant and bar were barely 1/4 full. We are well aware of Hawaii\u2019s uber strict COVID rules and have enjoyed supported Hawaii\u2019s local economy by eating out as often as possible.  La Vie had by far the strictest rules we encountered during our ten-day stay. The rules really didn\u2019t make sense all things considered- the restaurant wasn\u2019t even half full, we had to test negative for COVID in order to fly to Hawaii, and we have to wear masks everywhere and sanitize constantly. Apparently, all of those factors don\u2019t matter!  Instead of being greeted with a warm smile and welcome, a hostess with a nasty attitude gave us a look and really phony rejection response to our super simple, nice request to grab ONE drink at the literally empty bar.  Knowing how outlandish it was to tell hotel guests they couldn\u2019t have one drink at an empty bar which spanned about 20 feet, I requested to speak with the manager.  The manager tried reasoning that they were expecting a reservation and since they hold reservations for 15 minutes they can\u2019t seat us. I had to be the one to proactively request that if said party is a no-show, can we please be seated instead.  It was such a struggle. We sat on the bench outside for 20 minutes (meanwhile the restaurant is still pretty dead inside). Lo and behold...a party of one arrives at the bar. Somehow miraculously the manager found us a table and said we had to be out at 8. No problem- obviously we can have a drink in 1.5 hours (in fact, we each had 2 drinks in less time).  Here was the issue- the huge fuss they made and the plethora of nonsensical excuses they made, all with a really fake smile, just to accommodate us for our honeymoon as hotel guests. The manager then said literally five times \u201cthank you so much for your patience\u201d which made it feel really disingenuous because of how repetitive it was.  We had way better experiences at some of Honolulu\u2019s more authentic dive bars and felt way more welcome. This was the strangest restaurant experience ever.  My advice to management: reevaluate your business model. We\u2019re willing to dish out good money, but you need to be more accommodating. Work on people skills too.",

Their menu changes but count on it being top notch. We did the choose 3 tasting menu and shared it family style. The plates are on the smaller side but with a party of 4 we were able to order practically every item on the menu. My personal favorite is the crispy frog legs. Probably some of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Their asparagus and poached egg was also delicious. Don\u2019t forget to pair your meal with a good bottle of wine. Their selection is excellent and Hayden their sommelier is great.  Definitely go to La Vie for a wonderful evening.",

The food was really interesting and tasty, the service was incredible, the ambiance and view were perfect for a special occasion and we left completely stuffed with yummy food.  My favorites were probably the lobster remoulade and the entrecote of beef, though everything was quite good. The house-made bread with the truffle butter was AMAZING. They kept bringing us more and we thoroughly enjoyed that. I liked the layered cake for dessert as well!",

Choose 3 or 4 dishes from the course. There is no mistake in having good wines.  As expected, the owner of this restaurant is Japanese (only for the owner of the Hy's restaurant), and the food and seasoning are good, and it's delicious, which can be said to be a famous restaurant in Japan.  Is it a small amount? I was fully satisfied with the course (although not American size).  I especially liked caviar, quail and chocolate souffle.  You can also request a piano performance, so it might be a good idea to check out your favorite movie music and love songs (= ^ \uff65 ^ =)  (Original) \u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u3002  \u6d77\u969b\u3067\u306f\u7121\u3044\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3001\u51ac\u5834\u306f\u30b5\u30f3\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3061\u3087\u3046\u3069\u898b\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3068\u3001\u91d1\u66dc\u65e5\u306e\u591c\u306b\u306f\u30d2\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3\u306e\u82b1\u706b\u304c\uff01\uff01  \u304a\u6599\u7406\u306f3\u3082\u3057\u304f\u306f4\u54c1\u9078\u3076\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u3002 \u30ef\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3082\u306e\u304c\u63c3\u3063\u3066\u3066\u3001\u9593\u9055\u3044\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3002  \u6d41\u77f3\u3053\u3053\u306e\u304a\u5e97\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba(\u30cf\u30a4\u30ba\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u3060\u3051\u306b)\u304a\u6599\u7406\u3082\u5473\u4ed8\u3051\u3082\u826f\u304f\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u3000\u3044\u3044\u3084\u90fd\u5185\u306e\u6709\u540d\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3082\u826f\u3044\u54c1\u306e\u3042\u308b\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3055\u3002  \u91cf\u7684\u306b\u306f\u5c11\u91cf\uff1f(\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3067\u306f\u7121\u3044\u304c)\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u5145\u5206\u306b\u6e80\u8db3\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002  \u7279\u306b\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306f\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30a2\u3001\u30a6\u30ba\u30e9\u3001\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30b9\u30d5\u30ec\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002  \u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u6f14\u594f\u3082\u30ea\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u304a\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u308a\u306e\u6620\u753b\u97f3\u697d\u3084\u30e9\u30d6\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3068\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d(=^\uff65^=)",

Originally, the restaurant called \u201cThe Market\u201d was renewed and it was divided into casual French \u201cLavi\u201d and \u201cThe Lounge\u201d.  For dinner, choose a 3 or 5 course and choose the number of dishes from the menu. So, for example, in the 3 course, you can choose 3 desserts or 3 steaks.  Mr. Itamae, the main sushi master, said that the taste has improved considerably.
