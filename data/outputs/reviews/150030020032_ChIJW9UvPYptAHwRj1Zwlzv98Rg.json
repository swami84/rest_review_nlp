The salad, bread and bolognese sauce were all excellent, and the tiramisu was quite airy-tasty.  This place is not trying to be more than a local American-Italian place, and it excels at that. The wine list is nothing to write home about, but has a couple Italian Chiantis that are good table wines. If youre looking for true Italian food, go elsewhere, but if you like American-Italian, this is the best at this price point you will find. This crushes Olive Garden.",

The bar isn\u2019t set very high for tourist trap Mecca Waikiki, but the early bird hour was a draw for us.  Sadly, still overpriced even with the early bird specials.  I would give a 4 on food and a two on price, but considering everything in Oahu/Waikiki is insanely overpriced I\u2019ll leave be a bit generous with the 4 stars.",

I had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, house salad, calamari to start and mai tai. The drink was perfect! Respect to the bartender! The house salad was actually not bad. The vinegarette was tangy. Then came the calamari, which with a little lemon was actually not horrible. The red sauce served with it was plain. No flavor at all. Not even tomatoe flavor like you would think. Then the Alfredo; Bland is not the word! It was lifeless and just took up space. No salt, no pepper, nothing! The shrimp was over cooked which only added to my disappointment of the restaurant. It\u2019s clear that the only reason this restaurant is in business is because of the hotel it is attached to. I hate to leave a bad review but please don\u2019t waste your money on the food here. The drinks however are well worth your money.",

You could tell that they didn't even salt the water in which the pasta was boiled because even some salt in the pasta water would've have been infused into the pasta and would've been noticeable to those of us with a liking to the taste of salt. I had to add a good amount of salt to get just the slightest hint of taste. I understand that some restaurants may want to limit the salts/ spices used in dishes to accommodate a range of taste profiles but even the most novice of chefs should know that to make a dish a wonderful experience for the person eating it must have.have some flavor to it! Moving on to the chicken... What type of chicken did they use? I honestly felt like I was eating fake chicken. It was hard  and felt more like I was eating a gummy bear that lost its taste and was left out in the sun too long. It was a disappointing dish especially since I've had such great and simple fettuccine Alfredo's in many other restaurants. I feel bad leaving such a bad review but the truth is the truth. As a restaurant you are supposed to provide your customers a gastronomic experience that leaves them happy and  with a slight nostalgia to come back. In this case, I left disappointed and wishing I had eaten somewhere else.",

We stopped at spada for the early bird dinner special. Price was amazing for the area and the food... Best we've had yet. Service was fantastic. The only negative was no kids menu, granted it doesn't seem the place that wants screaming kids around anyway. (We got lucky with a mellow kid.) But we just ordered our son a cheese pizza and decided to take the leftovers for lunch. The pizza was awesome. Finally a pizza place that doesn't have a strong tomato taste. It was nice, mellow and sweet. 5 stars 6 if I could.",

Wait staff can't remember a simple order without bollocksing it up. So many better places nearby, it's a wonder how they stay in business. Save your money and go to the McDonald's down the street. It's about as Italian, and they are less likely to screw up your order.  So here's my suggestion if one of the staff read this review: WRITE THE ORDERS DOWN. It's not an onerous task, and will make for far fewer customer complaints.",

When I pointed this out i was told \"it's mild garlic\", sorry but that's b*llsh*t. My wife had the \"four cheese pasta shells\" more like \"white gunk and leather shells\" Certainly no lemon zest or Gorgonzola cheese and it had been baked so long the pasta was hard and tough. I have had far better meals cooked by first year catering students. My wife and I have traveled a lot and this was one of the worst we have ever experienced, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",

Due to the fact that the female manager in the SPADA Restaurant is the most UNPROFESSIONAL manager i have ever encountered. I Have stayed at Marriots all over the world; Paris, California, New York and i was so bothered by the actions of this woman that i shall never return to this location. She was our server the first morning and ignored us as she sat there doing nothing. When she FINIALLY took our order she was rude and snappy erging us to hurry up though there was only 2 other tables. The second morning we had a different female server who was courteous fast and efficient. Half way through our meal our first server who we found out was the manager, screamed at our server rudely in the dinning room in front of all the customers bringing the employee to tears. Public humiliation is usually not the encouragment someone needs especially when the manager was just sitting there doing nothing. You can tell shes an unhappy pesamistic person. 2 employees would eventually quit by the end of our 10 day stay. My experience at other Marriot dining facilities is complete opposite. I take my mom to the mothers day brunch back home in New York every year. I am a travel agent and i shall advise everyone i speak to not to waste their money at this place. plus the food quality is horrible. If i was the owner of this place i would seriously consider change of management unless he wishes to lose more money. This is the most common reason why restaurants fail. The owner is too trusting in management and management becomes power-crazed. Having a dictator in a resteraunt does not work the only way a business runs successfully is if it is run with communication, respect, and understanding. I feel bad for the manager that little bit of power is all she probably has to cling to in her life. she needs a hug.",
