We tried the buffalo wings, which had a classic tasting buffalo sauce, but they were breaded, which causes the wings to become soggy in transit. No blue cheese dressing for dipping, just ranch. The medusa specialty roll was amazing, huge pieces so be prepared for 2 bites per piece. The garlic salmon roll was also great, the house garlic ponzu is what made it, I could drink that sauce. The tequila roll was decent, very fresh tuna. I didn't give 5 stars because I've had better sushi in the area, the wings were breaded, no blue cheese dressing, and the price was high for the neighborhood and location. Will definitely be back to try more menu items to get the full restaurant experience and I want to support local family owned restaurants. 1st experience was great, but not the best sushi in Logan Square.",

        "caption": "Amazing! I was delighted with my experience at Raiz. The staff is friendly, the sushi is fresh, and the prices are totally reasonable. Not only were the flavors delicious, but the presentation of the dishes was colorful and creative. We sat at the patio out back, which was truly an ideal place to spend the evening. If you like sushi, please go! If you don't, they also have other options on the menu like flatbreads and sandwiches. With the current situation, I'll note too that the place was super clean, and the whole staff wore masks. I believe they offer takeout/delivery services too if you're trying to avoid going out right now.  I'll certainly be returning soon! Can't wait for my next plate of tasty sushi.",
