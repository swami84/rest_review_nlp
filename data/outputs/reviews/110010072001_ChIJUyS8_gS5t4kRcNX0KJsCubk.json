In this particular one it is inside in Whole Foods (it was not mentioned in the directions).  Secondly, due to covid-19 it's best to place the order online. I would recommend it. But I believe you can still go there and place an order without online orders.  Now about the food. The plant based burger is getting better and as more restaurants present these items it just gets better. I got the family deal. 4 burgers, 4 fries, 4 drinks and 4 cookies. I added the sauces too. Now I'm not lying that was some good food.  The burgers and I can't stress it enough you will not miss the meet. The sweet potato fries and regular fries are crisp. The food is fulfilling and not overwhelming. What I mean is that you don't feel bad afterwards. I recommend getting a small meal. It's enough food unless you are super hungry.  So try this spot out. The one on H street SE is in Whole Foods. I'm sure the other ones are good too. Right now there's a Groupon for the food.",

I ordered the Chikn Funguy sandwich wrapped in Swiss Chard, A PLNTY Meal (burger) with bloomies and mandarin cardamom juice, and a large crispy herb fries. I was determined to try a little bit of each thing that they offered. It was AMAZING!! IAM NOT A VEGAN but I am making better food choices for me and my family. They had no idea they were eating a fully plant based meal. They throughly enjoyed. I ordered through doordash. I will ABSOLUTELY \ud83d\udcaf.  Visit the restaurant so I could eat the food hot next time. Thats right I enjoyed my meal so much and it wasn't even hot.",
