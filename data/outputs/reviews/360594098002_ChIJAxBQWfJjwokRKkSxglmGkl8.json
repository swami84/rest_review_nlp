The shrimp has a distinctive roasted flavor that made them almost smoky and the wings were fried with no heavy breading. The kale salad was like the best slaw ever with other veggies and pumpkin seeds and the fries had mixed herbs on them. There's also a broad selection of Caribbean entrees, sodas, and adult beverages. I highly recommend this comfortable, casual spot.",
