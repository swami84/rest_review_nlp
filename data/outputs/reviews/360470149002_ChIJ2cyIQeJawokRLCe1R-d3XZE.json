Burgers aren't hard to make but to make an amazing burger is hard. They also have hit mighty wings that are great, actually the best that i ever had.  The burgers themselves are juicy and never over cooked. i meant the burger juice literally pop out of your mouth while you bite it down. They totally standout from so many competitors in the area.

Long story short, he ate his face off and absolutely LOVED every second of it.  We came on a Saturday night and surprisingly got seated immediately this is generally rare for a weekend at gnarly eats because it's always so packed). I had to let him try their famous buttermilk fried chicken burger.....that sauces and juiciness of the chicken is oh so good.",

Everything was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I loved the addition of red cabbage to give the burger some crunch. The chicken sandwich was quite spicy so be warned!  The place is small but welcoming. We chatted with the owner briefly and he was very friendly.  Looking forward to trying their rolled ice cream when the weather is warmer.",
