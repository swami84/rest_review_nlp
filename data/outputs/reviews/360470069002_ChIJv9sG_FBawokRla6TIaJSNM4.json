They have outdoor seating on the sidewalk and also outside in the back of the restaurant. Nicely lit. Romantic Italian music playing in the background. I had a Sangria which in my opinion tasted like juice. Hefty glass but a waste of calories for me. Didn't bother to order another. We had calamari for starters and it was fresh and delicious!! Not greasy. Loved it. It was a lot. So took some home. I ordered the penne bistecca which was delicious!! So tasty. Again a lot of food on the plate. My man had steak and mashed potatoes which was also tasty. It came with salad on the side! So good! Lots of food. We both ended up bringing it home and had it for next day brunch!!! Will definitely return! Loved the ambiance and service.",

For 1 hour they bring 1 glass per person at a time rather than let's say giving the table a pitcher. They try to say it's a NY law thing but I worked in a restaurant... it's not. They just want to milk the hour as you'll get about 5 glasses max as you have to wait until they get the glass and bring it back which alone takes them 8-10 mins. Unlimited means if I want 5 glasses at a time I expect 5 glasses at a time. It's best to just get a pitcher for yourself and it's cheaper in the long run on top of being more fulfilling.",

Pricing is in the middle, so it depends on what you order. The crab cakes were very good. The ribeye was a bit tough and pricey. I wish it was a little more seasoned or had some chimichurri sauce but the crust on it was pretty tasty. The fettuccini chicken Alfredo was great. The cream wasn\u2019t too heavy, it was just right. Drinks are strong and well priced; try the agave margarita. I definitely want to return and try other things on their menu.",

They have a great bottomless brunch ($17 for 1 hour). The environment is ideal and compliant with social distancing and all of the CDC\u2019s COVID guidelines. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the music is always a nice blend. My go to meal is their Viva Nutella Crepe (delicious!) with a side of eggs and smoked salmon (yum!). When I\u2019m feeling bold I get the Greek Omelette (no olives with smoked salmon & tomatoes \ud83d\ude0b). My boyfriend switches between the French toast and pancakes (he still doesn\u2019t know which one he likes more lol). This spot is great for a date and also for groups; I came here for my twin nieces 12th birthday with at least 8-10 people and we were accommodated well. Keep in mind the wait on any Saturday can be anywhere from 30 mins to an hour but it\u2019s always worth it. Their brunch is also available during weekdays. The entire staff and overall hospitality of Verde\u2019s is one of the reasons it is one of my favorite restaurants. They have a garden in the back with a ceiling that opens up and heaters to keep warm as well as outdoor seating in the front.",

One thing I hate about bottomless brunch service is how long they sometimes take to bring out the drinks. That was not the case here at all. Before I could even finish one mimosa, the next one was out. The food was really good and came out in a reasonable amount of time. By the time our brunch was over, we were all drunk out of our minds.

I had the Canadian Benedict, and my eggs were watery and the potatoes overcooked to the point of being inedible.  The biggest problem was management. We were a large party with a reservation at 1pm. At 12:45, when we were all already there or on our way, they called to say our reservation would be pushed back to 1:30. Okay, fine. Not a lot of warning, but okay. However, there's nowhere to wait inside with a large group, so we stood outside in the cold - for an hour, not the half hour we were told. We were finally seated at 2pm.  Again: wait staff is great. Everything else: pretty freaking terrible.",

One of few places where you can reserve a table for brunch. We have been to many brunch places throughout the city and have ordered countless omelettes.  Here we each ordered an omelette. My girlfriend gave specific instructions for her order which were not followed through and my omelette was supposed to have tomatoes which were lacking. The taste of the omelettes were just alright. The omelettes came with green salad and potatoes. The salad was very plain, not even a vinaigrette on it, and the potatoes were wedges which actually came burnt. We didn't take advantage of the bottomless mimosa deal which could've bumped up our rating.",

I had the pork chops in a Mediterranean sauce made with mushrooms, tomatoes and onions.  It was flavorful and delicious. What would have made the dish perfect if some polenta was paired with the dish.  I had the backed clams as a starter and I must say they were done to perfection, I have never \u201csucked\u201d on a clam shell as I did whilst enjoy those!  Excellent, Excellent, I cannot day enough about those clams.  My only gripe would be the Sangria, it would have been a bit stronger, my date and I finished the cafe none the less, but the fruits & berries were fresh and added a bright flavor to the sangria.  Customer service was fantastic, they were attentive, engaging and did not over crowd you or pressure you to order.  I love that and we will return for another date night sometime soon and my be try their Brunch,  which I understand happens every day.  Great Job Verde on Smith, you\u2019re going places.",

I called a few days before to confirm the reservation and outdoor seating. 30 minutes before we arrive I get a text from the restaurant asking to confirm our reservation. As I was on the subway, I got the chance to answer FIVE MINUTES later. The manager then responded saying he had given our table to someone else. When we arrived at 2 for our scheduled reservation, the manager made us wait for thirty minutes. Then proceeded to sit us at a table not for 13 AND inside. I asked why we weren\u2019t outside and why we had to wait thirty minutes and the manager responded with \u201cyou can wait another twenty minutes if you want to sit outside\u201d. As someone who works as a server and has been a hostess, this treatment of customers with a large table and confirmed reservation was in all honesty BS. If it wasn\u2019t my birthday I would have left and gone somewhere else. Not respecting our reservation and being rude because they messed up was absolutely appalling and I am shocked that that man is a legitimate manager. 0/10 do not recommend at all. I wish there was someone above a manager there to speak to because I was absolutely appalled.",

Unlike some other bottomless brunch spots in the area, as long as you are seated by 4 you get the 2 hours of mimosas. The food was great and came out quickly. I accidentally unscrewed the pepper and it dumped an excessive amount onto my eggs. I said it was fine, but the waiter quickly brought me out new eggs anyways which was so nice. The drinks were all good. It is cheap champagne, but what else can you expect. I like that they offer other options such as screwdrivers and Bellini.  Would definitely recommend and go back.

I should of know it was a mistake coming here once we got to the door we waited a good 10-15 min several employees seen us and passed us bit not one said someone will be with you. That was first strike. Once we got seated the waiter was very rude and just in a rush taking our order. I ordered 2 different beers and once the drinks came he placed my friend mimosa and a beer in front of my husband did not once say your beer is coming or any other thing to us. I waited a good 15 minutes and I finally just asked management because I could bot get the waiters attention. Finally I'm trying to explain is this a stella or  IPA beer and the man just cuts me off I could not finish explaining so I tell him can I just explain. He goes on and tells me again. There is no more Stella it finished okay so Is this a stella or IPA plus the waiter came to table placed beer but did not tell me here is such and such and we do not have the other beer would you like something else and he looked confused so he took glass and brought a IPA  still did not apologize for the confusion and miscommunication. The food for most part was good the koby burger eggs and steak chocolate chip pancakes mozzeral sticks and chicken fingers and fries but the steak and cheese panini was okay the bread was hard as a rock and the crab cake burger  was so soggy could not eat it. We tried getting the waiters attention but we couldn't by then we were annoyed so just ate around what we could. Not once did the waiter ask if everything was okay. Waiters in this place were just rude not friendly not inviting.",

A noon reservation for 5 made well on advance of Mother's Day was apparently derailed by the weather. Regardless of the fact that weather predictions all week indicated rain, the restaurant overbooked. The result; a completely unusable covered outdoor area and seating 30 minutes or more behind...with no place to wait except the cold, damp outdoor space.  Initially my party was told we couldn't be seated because they had no record of our reservation. After some fumbling, the host found it by phone number. At that point we were told a 20 minute wait, and please go outside in the rain because you're blocking the door. I made it clear (and was admittedly rude) that we needed to be seated as my daughter had 2 hours to get her bus back to college. Twenty minutes turned into 40, finally we were seated.  My daughter ended up having to change her bus reservation with an additional cost. Thanks for the mimosa and apology, but a phone call to let us know of the issue prior to arriving could gave averted the entire fiasco. Additionally, although time would not have allowed us to accept, the offer of dessert or coffee gratis would gave been appreciated as recognition of our invonvenience due to your error.  Pssst...Verde, in addition to the culinary industry, you're also in the service and hospitality industry. Go the extra step to service your patrons. If you feel you're too successful to take ownership of situations such as this, you won't be successful for very long.",

I want to start first with their decor, upscale with that rustic feeling along with cozy and romantic lights. I really the brick wall, it is very BROOKLYN for me. The dining room looks very cleaned and organized I can tell management know how to run also I noticed they have A grade.it is always a good sign. Anyway let me talk about the service; the owners; Mark and Abi are great hosts, they welcome their guests by the door with a nice smile and welcoming attitude. They check every table frequently if they are ok and needed anything. We had the same treatment as well. The wait staffs are amazing, friendly and very polite. The service was fast (we had an early dinner) and the drinks came quickly. They have a wide selection of good wine from Italy, Spain, Chile, New Zealand, and California. I tried their Agave Margarita; it was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. They must have a good bartender because bar seats were full. (They have happy hour during weeknights)  The menu has a nice mix of options and priced well considering it is Brooklyn. Fresh bread and olives are brought out to settle you in; we were told that the olives and olive oil are imported from Italy.  I had the Straccetti with arugula. The meat was cooked perfectly ( ordered Medium) the cut was high quality it was super tender and still juicy. It was a very good idea to match tasty steak with fresh crunchy arugula and hard shaved parmesan cheese. I also ordered The French fries were amazing! Very crisp and seasoned perfectly.  My wife ordered a seafood linguini.  The pasta (found out that they have fresh homemade pasta) was a perfectly cooked, clearly timed correctly to add to the sauce. The seafood was also perfectly cooked for each item. It could have used a scallop or something but it was still awesome. For the desserts, we tried their homemade Cr\u00e8me Brule and Tiramisu. Both were so tasty.  The timing was just right, clearly, the kitchen isn't pushing food out just to move tickets and that they spent the time that it needed. Things we found out after speaking with Mark and Abi - Live Music ( Every Friday-Sunday Nights) - Happy Hour (  Weeknights ) - Their Famous Brunch (Bottomless Cocktails). We definitely will try. - Delivery \u2013 Take Out Service -Catering for Offices, Residential, Lunch Meetings  It is our new favorite place. Well organized.",

Thats actually how we \"discovered\" it.  Hungry and not willing to wait at Caf\u00e9 Luluc or Clover Club, we figured we'd give it a spin.  Never turned back.  I legit have cravings for their Steak and Eggs.  Eggs are always cooked to perfection and they actually make the steak to your preference.  Amazing hamburger as well.  Coffee is some of the best in town. (Ask for cream, they'll bring you cream, not the genitically modified Half and Half).  They have unlimited 2 hour drink specials (mimosas, belinis, Bloody Marie's) but I don't drink that much with brunch so I've never tried it. Dinner is exceptional as well.  Great Italian favorites.  My one...and I mean ONLY complaint is their syrup...its legit gross. It's sounds snobby but if I'm going to Verde and in the mood for pancakes, I'll bring my own maple syrup.",
