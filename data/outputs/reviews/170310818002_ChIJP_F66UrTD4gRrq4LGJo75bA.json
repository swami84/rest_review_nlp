These are COVID times though and we chose to sit outside so that's not their fault! We got nachos which were pretty decent. I wish the cocktails had been a little stronger for the price but they were very very tasty either way. Our waitress was super attentive and friendly. There were a lot of people eating inside but they were all completely separate and distanced which was great to see.  I've come here many times before covid and this place is usually packed - just happy to see they're still doing well and can't wait to return again soon. Bartenders are usually very attentive and food has historically always been very good esp for bar food.",

On January 19th, when I went in for my reservation I was told it wasn\u2019t in the system. Additionally, I was told because there was a private party they were not honoring the way I made a reservation. Crazy, because when you make a reservation through Google Assistant they reach out to the restaurant before confirming with the customer that they have a reservation. If they knew they were having a private event then not only sure they have turned off the reservations but THEY SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE CONFIRMED WITH GOOGLE ASSISTANT. 11 days and no one saw there was a reservation in their system that they weren\u2019t going to honor. No accommodations were made to assist us on THEIR ERROR. I was offered a round of drinks that I never received. This business is obviously not smart enough to have proper operations so I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t stay to eat because who knows if they are even capable of providing a good experience and/or decent food.",

The drinks were very well made and not watered down. The service was rather quick considering how mane people were there and how few bartenders there were at the time.  A variety of food was also provided. My favorite was the hot Cheetos crusted chicken tenders. This was AMAZING. I don't even like hot Cheetos but I like spicy food but I gave it a try. I did not regret it. The Cheetos are crushed down to a very fine almost powder like texture. The chicken is fully covered in the Cheetos. It's a decent size chicken tender so the ratio to chicken to Cheetos was also just right. We also had the buffalo chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fries and buffalo chicken slider. All of those item were also just as good. Everything tasted really fresh and since most of it was fried I was afraid of how oily it could have been but nothing tasted overly oily or greasy.  Definitely recommend checking this place out. They have great music and the happy hour menu had a pretty good selection for a good price.",

Not sure if living in Miami for 20 years and working on Nightlife for 18 has augmented my perception of nightlife but I was definitely not impressed nor entertained. Club esthetics were a 5 out of 10.For more interesting reviews and places to visit check out @ricklemoinevip",

The menu included more just your ordinary everyday meals. Great healthy alternative choices, such as the Lobster Roll, Tuna Sandwiches, or Calamari Rings, offer flavorful taste. They are just light enough to get your feet moving to the rhythm of the beat. More photos will be coming soon, because the design of the club is one or it's many alluring qualities.

One gave me the wrong beer and tried to make ME look like the bad girl, the other bartender refused to allow me to order food at the bar! The only staff member who tried to make things right was Danielle; she was the only saving grace for this bar. Things were a tad bit better until the owner started kicking all of the patrons out at 8pm when the party was supposed to last until 11. As we all left, we'd noticed a squad car, a SQUAD CAR in front of the venue!! We were offered no explanation as to why a squad car was waiting in front of the venue!!

How Can a Venue suddenly pull the plug on a well functioning, truly beautiful party -in midswing, only to make early preparations for a another party happening later in the evening?? I was in the process of inviting 15 more friends to come out and enjoy this party when suddenly the party was ended saying we all have to leave. Another party is taking precedence over ours. Hard to even imagine. Bounce Venue Owner/mgmt. Have left a very unfavourable memory and may possibly need to be investigated. No good faith business practiced at Bounce Sporting Club.

I left my wallet at the bar. I called the next morning and a hostess confirmed they had it in their possession via name and wallet color/brand. They said they would leave it at the hostess desk for me to come pick it up. I returned the next night after work and explained my situation. They checked the safe and entire hostess desk. The wallet gone. Understanding that someone who worked there stole the 350 dollar wallet I checked to make sure my card wasn\u2019t being used. After attempting to get in contact with this place as well as the manager I finally had to call back several times before I could  let them know I was filing a police report. Not an hour later I got a call back saying they had it. Just in time for me to have cancelled my cards and gone to the DMV to get a new ID. If you ask me this place is shady. My friends have even told me they add to their tips if you leave both copies of the receipt. Also it\u2019s next to a bus stop that the cops are often for random ruckus. I normally don\u2019t care to write reviews but after having some schiesty trash pulled on me I thought I\u2019d do you all a favor.",

I had planned to celebrate my bday here , this pass Saturday 8/11 when I realize the rooftop was open. I got there say around 3:45p had no problem walking in with my husband and didn't even get asked for id. We were just told where to walk to go to the rooftop. I told my friends and family to meet me there and come to find out some was being denied entry. Mind you its Empty only  a good 10 ppl was on the rooftop. I politely went back downstairs to find out what the issue was when I got a call from my friend saying he was being denied entry in there but the bouncer became very rude and started cursing at my friend that was trying to understand what the attire was while refused to be let in because the bouncer said he didn't have proper attire(he had a black shirt with gold writing, jeans(not baggy) and casual shoes) and the bouncer said he was f**king annoying he got upset real quick (who does that). He was denied entry based on his attire and I wasn't aware this sports bar had a certain dress code this early. But apparently he was looking for a certain look. To make a long story short a few of my guest was racial profile and I see other people of different ethnicities had been racial profiled by now reading reviews as well. It's sad and disgusting to see this still goes on in 2018. Racism still exist but it's not ok. I'm proud of the skin I'm in (Black) and it's sad and I hate a few of my guest was not treated fairly while others were, especially when the few ppl that was let in that was White didn't look appropriately dress for their so call dress code. I get a place has a right to refuse but how it was done was rudely, unprofessional and down right wrong. I don't recommend this place at all!",

When you first arrive, the exterior is sort of unassuming.. kind of a plain brown building -- no huge signage (it's just adjacent to Griddle 24 on Chicago Ave if you're having trouble finding it).. nice french doors.  It almost looks like a bistro.  But then you go inside and it's like the Tardis.. High ceilings, modern but comfortable booth seating.. (and lots of it).. and I was there for an event in a private room.  The security guy pointed to a wall and said, \"it's through there.\"  But there was no door.. I mustered up all the faith I could and pressed on that wall and it moved!  The private room has it's own bar and when not in use, it's an easy flow portion off the main floor.  There's another lounge up a flight of stairs (or a ride in the elevator) that can probably accommodate about 20 - 25 people.. it has a sort of balcony that overlooks the back bar and seating area.  Since they just opened in November, they didn't get a chance to unveil their rooftop space -- so keep your eyes peeled for that debut later this spring!  They have a sister property in New York that's kind of a big deal -- so it's worth checking out on that alone.. but when you go inside, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at the impressive \"un-douchey-ness\" of this welcoming and upscale friendly bar.  Now I have to tell you the bad news.  You're going to leave this place totally addicted to Banana infused Jameson.  I had no idea I would like it.. at first I thought \"there's no way.. BANANA??\"  but.. yes.  Banana. in Jameson. the sweet fruit kills that burny alcoholly sensation and makes this eternally drinkable.  It's best (I think) served on the rocks.. nursed like a sweet baby..  Seriously.  I dream about this stuff.  Drink it at your own risk.",

The music and ambiance were great, the bartenders were polite, and while there were a few snobs sprinkled in the crowd, most of the crowd was amicable.

Also, I came in with a group of 15 people and we were the ONLY people in the entire venue; they had about 15 staff walking around and no one came up to take our order. Also, we're the victims of false advertising. Waitress said bottomless mimosas come with a brunch meal, turns out they are $20 extra in addition to a $17 brunch menu item. Smh.

On a Sunday there are more sleazy looking guys in suits with ear pieces than servers and bar tenders, which begs the question, why place an emphasis on cheesy looking guys instead of service? This place clearly didn't do it's research before opening.  Midwest people will think this is a joke and awkward feeling.  Or, you'll attract the scene of people who want to come hang out and not spend money.   Good luck. . Feels very much like an American Junkie which closed after a couple months.",

Not a big crowd as they had just opened. Burgers came out, literally, COLD and the salt content was strong enough to burn my mouth. Come on......get a simple burger out hot! Drink glasses for soft drinks are very small and this causes you to constantly order refills (maybe due to the salt content in the food). Also, there was a bouncer stationed outside the front door and a Door person inside the front door (why, I don\u2019t know). Too many young girls (waitresses) running around asking if everything is ok......over and over again to the point of it being annoying. This is a great set-up and with a bit more professionalism and more respect for the food coming out of the kitchen, this place should do well. Only been open for a week.",
