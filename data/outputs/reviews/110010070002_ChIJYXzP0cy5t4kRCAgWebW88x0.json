The food in it of itself was very good (4 stars). However, the captain (front of the house manager) lacked the necessary service skills for an establishment of this prestige. My wife when making the reservation asked for a center seating at the chef table. We were sat at the furthest left seating at the chef table. We alerted our server that we would like to move to the center seating that just came available as we sat down and they stated they had to check with the \u201ccaptain.\u201d The captain came over and was way over the top in trying to explain himself when the simple solution was to move to the center seats which were available. The captain said \u201cI hear you are unhappy about the seating, your not missing anything. Behind the wood barrier is just another station... I can give you a tour of how everything works.... etc. The captain just came off over the top and just wasn\u2019t genuine. Alex our server and the rest of the wait staff were tremendous.",

Pineapple and Pearls typically charges a fee for reservations cancelled so close to the actual date which is understandable given the amount of work they put into each meal. However, when I contacted the reservation team at Pineapple and Pearls and explained the situation they refunded our deposit in full. A special thank you to Nikki and the reservation team. You are a class act organization and we greatly appreciate the act of kindness during this difficult time. We cannot wait to eat there in the very near future. Based on how we were treated before even entering the restaurant I am sure the service is out of this world!",

From the first step into the door until stepping out was immaculate in every sense. There were I think ten courses each with 6 drink pairings One of which was a Sherry from my wife\u2019s birth year. The level of planning in thinking of that detail and delivering is astounding.  Yet this was typical of the perfect service given to us by Alex. The military timing of the service staff and kitchen was an amazing thing to watch and experience. The only deterrent from coming here more is the price but it is definitely worth a special occasion. It was super nice to pre-pay the entire bill and just be able to walk out after the dining experience was finished. I will definitely go back for that.",

It innovates without challenging the palate too much so you don't need to be a particularly adventurous eater to enjoy it but still won't find it boring if you are.

For those questioning dress code, anything less formal than a tuxedo and more formal than short sleeve shirt and jeans and you won't feel over or under-dressed.  Price is as would be expected for a place with a pair of Michelin stars, but is worth the cost. It is somewhat less pricy than the other, perhaps more famous two-star DC spot, Minibar.",

We opted for the chef's table experience with the luxury wine pairing and the optional course.  As we entered we were provided with a cool towel while we waited for our table, and were offered a drink to get us started. After we sat down we were introduced to the restaurant and service as our courses were prepared. The service started with a table-side cocktail with a series of bite size pastry snacks, before moving on to a number of sea food dishes, eventually ending up at a barbecued lamb dish. The drink pairings were excellent, and included a number of vintage wines that are usually unavailable to purchase unless you have a connection in the industry. The highlight of the meal was definitely the optional Caviar Taco's and the Creole Style Blackened Monkfish.  After the meal was over our server offered us coffee and gave us a signed menu by the kitchen staff as we were celebrating our first anniversary, which was a really nice way to top off the evening.  Overall I highly recommend Pineapple & Pearls for a special occasion, it's worth its 2 Michelin starred rating and provides a memorable experience that you'll cherish for time to come.",

The waitstaff can be over the top.  Way too much talking and posturing at times from an overly long and, frankly, silly greeting (we're going to have fun tonight) to a detailed description of the vermouth they're pouring into your martini or a several minute discussion of the salad and dressing they're making for you  (we're talking here about a simple green salad with a vinaigrette dressing.)  The food was often, but not always, very good; the portions were impossibly small.  I truly left, after 2 1/2 hours, still hungry.  The main course, as it was referred to by the waiter, was a beef strip loin accompanied by a single endive that was gone in four bites. The last three courses were all deserts of a sort, accompanied by a somewhat sweet wine.  No cheese course which would have certainly helped. And the wine, none of which I believe was from special vintages or vineyards, was quite meagerly poured and yes, they would refill your glass if you asked, but really, there should have been a more generous pour to begin with.  I appreciate the concept here, but I really believe Pineapple and Pearls needs to modify their server's practices, revisit what and how much they're serving and open up a bit on the not terribly expensive wines/drink they serve.  This, as we experienced it, was just not worth $335.",

        "caption": "I originally left this review on trip advisor.  The staffs here are young & charming. They try their best to accommodate you. You'll leave the dining experience thinking that they are extremely well-trained and professional. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place for anyone looking for an exquisite and unique food experience.  My girlfriend and I had the bar experience with wine pairing. Their pairing was well thought out. I wasn't a big fan of the smoky beer, but I understood the appeal. Every other drink was decent and definitely worth the additional $60 dollar(might have been $65).  The food here was overall subpar. The biggest disappointment came from the monkfish & the duck. They were both over-seasoned. I had to go to the restroom twice to spit it out. We later realized that the sauces served with those dishes were the culprits. I had to wipe off the sauce from the proteins before eating. The proteins themselves were well-seasoned. The line cook in charge of the sauces definitely screwed up. The bun that came with the duck was also overly seasoned. This ended up in the toilet as well. I believe this was my first Michelin two experience where I had to spit the food out. It was definitely a numbing experience.  The desserts were good. The sweetness definitely helped me recover from the extremely over-seasoned fish & duck.  I am genuinely confused as to why this place has two stars. I believe they will lose their star if the food suffers like this in the future.  If you are visiting DC, I would recommend avoiding P&P and visiting other fine dining establishments. I would personally recommend 'Reverie' if you are a fan of duck dishes. 'Reverie' waitstaffs are underwhelming but... hey, they just opened. I'm sure the restaurant will mature over the months.  If you live here & you love food as much as I do, give other places a visit before P&P. Chef Patrick O'Connell's establishment will give you an extremely unique and delicious experience. A bit out of the way, but definitely... most definitely worth.  I really do hate myself for having to write this review. I never had such a terrible food experience in a Michelin-rated restaurant. I mean no disrespect to all the hard-working staffs here at P&P. It was probably a one time mistake from the line cook. Nonetheless, I left the establishment thinking that I paid money not for the food but only for the service of extremely pleasant waitstaffs.",

It is a blind tasting menu.  1st visit - I felt that the staff did a good job informing me about the courses at the start of my meal, and gauging my preferences based on that conversation. Although I really enjoyed the cuisine, I still felt like I could have eaten more food by the end of the meal.  2nd visit - I went last week, and it was a horrible experience from beginning to end. We stood there for 10 min waiting to be seated. Once seated, I was never asked about my alcohol preferences for the course  pairings, although the couple next to me was asked that. The courses were not explained to me, and it resulted in me having to send back 4 of my savory courses, some of which were not supplemented with any alternative course. At the end of my meal, I expressed my dissatisfaction with Madison (mgr), who said she would contact me to discuss it further in the next few business days. Not only have they not contacted me, but I sent an email to the restaurant 5 days ago which they have not responded to. Last night I sent a text directly to the reservation desk, and again no response. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT. The Inn at Little Washington has 3 stars, and gave me more food at a higher quality for less money, with much better customer service! I don't care if they have 2 stars, the way this restaurant is managed and what they deliver for the price point is a joke.",

As soon as you enter Pineapple and Pearls, they make it clear this is your night and they are there to take care of you.  We were started with a delicious white tea while we waited and then were seated in the beautiful dining area. You will be stricken by how quiet it is despite the chefs working right there. They demonstrate discipline. There is no drama here. Just absolute focus on making delicious courses.  We traveled along a 10 or so tasting course. Each course is gorgeous looking. Served beautifully and delicious. The pairings - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic were spot on. What I like is it\u2019s not just wine on the alcohol side. They had some truly delicious and unique ciders tonight and a smoked beer that was perfect.  We loved all the dishes. I would say that we enjoyed the desserts more on our last visit. They were more innovative and surprising. These weren\u2019t bad, they just weren\u2019t sensational.  They focus on taking care of any dietary concerns. In fact, you hear the entire chef gang  calling and repeating the needs of each visitor as they begin.  It was a beautiful evening. Fit for a special occasion.",

So much of thr time I feel like the food and drink barely pair together. At P&P they really do a great job at making sure the food and drink are on thr same level. The duck was amazing and I could have eaten the whole thing. It was presented in two ways both just as tasty. The beef carpacio was also very smooth. There were so many little touches that went a long way to making the meal special. The friendly greetings from the staff. The warm towel and tea when you first enter. I would have added an extra star if I would have felt more of the dishes were outstanding. This was still worth the money for me.",

The overall vibe is \"hipster brunch\" and this place represents all that is bad about DC.  The music was weird, the menu didn't flow, and really only two courses stood out.  The chef must have just discovered beurre blanc because they put it on everything.  The drink paring was aggressive and the experience felt more like rushing a frat than enjoying a a nice dinner.  The servers seemed to be acting, whereas at Minibar everything felt legitimate.  They churched up trout roe, charging 75 extra per person, when you can buy an entire jar of the same quality for 35.  If you are wanting a great dining experience, go to Minibar.  If you have been to all of the other Michelin-rated restaurants in the area, just go to McDonalds and save yourself 500 bucks.",

I've gone several times, but have never managed to get anything other than bar seating. It provides a wondrous tasting menu which includes either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage pairings. In fact, you'll be served beverages and hot towels the minute you come in the door, to prepare for your meal.  The bar seating is actually very nice, because you can see the inner workings of the kitchen right in front of you. It's almost as much fun watching the kitchen as eating the food! The chefs have a call-and-response routine where they announce what is going to whom, and it sounds a bit like a pirate crew might.  The dishes are very small as befits a tasting menu, and you don't order anything, or even know what's on the menu in advance. If you're vegetarian or have other dietary needs, you just tell them when you're making your reservations and they'll take care of you. They give you a copy of that night's menu when you leave, so you can remember what you ate, but each dish is pretty complicated and intricate, and it's hard to remember exactly what everything was without the menu! The service is impeccable, of course.  At some restaurants, ones I like even, tasting menus can seem like a bit of a slog. Here, though, it's more like an adventure to see what will happen next. The waitstaff is very good about explaining in detail what you're getting, how to eat it and so on.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",

There is no menu; they bring you food in the form of a tasting menu with 11 courses but each course is tiny so it is not too much food. The service is generally excellent (one tiny screw up - I said I was allergic to (hard) shell fish but liked all kinds of  other seafood. They started to bring our table of 4 the tasting menu but they assumed I could not eat ANY seafood so they gave me different items. By the second course we realized their error and they \"course corrected\".  The price includes a wine pairing with about 7 different wines. I don't drink much so my pairing was non-alcohol.  It turns out they have a non-alcohol paring that is fabulous. I would recommend, for a party of two, have one person get the non-alcohol paring and one person get the wine pairing that way you can experience both.  Positive: Each dish usually has several flavors and textures that work very well together (even if they seem very unlikely). The service is excellent. The ambiance is relaxed (but definitely upscale).  (Minor) Negatives:  The location does not have any obvious place to park.  They say they have valet parking but you would not know that.  The valet parking is actually around the corner, about a block away, between G & E streets (with nobody standing out front of the restaurant directing you). You would be better off taking a taxi or uber. I don't think they take walk ins,  certainly not on weekends. When making a reservation on a weekend, it is really tough - 5 weeks in advance and plan on a 5 pm reservation on a Friday. The restaurant does not have a name on the outside, just an address (715 8st SE). None of the above effects the quality of the food just minor annoyances.",

        "caption": "Pineapple & Pearls has a prodigious reputation that has bestowed upon them a handful of accolades including two Michelin stars, one of only three restaurants in the D.C. area to receive two stars. So you know this place is legit.  For our sixth anniversary, the BF and I booked reservations for the Chef's Counter. We love to watch cooks prepare food, so this was the perfect spot. Definitely the best seats in the house! Currently, the price for the Chef's Counter and the Dining Room is $280/person. This includes all the courses, beverage pairings, tax, and gratuity. If you don't want alcohol, the price drops to $255.  Your credit card is charged $140 when you book, and the other half is charged the day of the reservation. Just a note that starting tomorrow, April 3, prices are increasing to $325/person!  Although on the more expensive side of restaurants, I think P&P is well worth its price tag. This is the hottest restaurant in D.C. for a good reason. And contrary to popular belief that $$$$$ and fine dining = stuffy and pretentious, that is the opposite for P&P. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and enticing. I love the modern feel and look of this place.  The food is phenomenal. We had 11 courses of perfectly composed, creative dishes. You're taken on a journey through these dynamic courses. We started with chips and mole dip and advanced to abalone panna cotta, bone-in turbot (more restaurants need to do this!), pierogi with black truffle and potato skin, pork with pommes Anna, and T\u00eate De Moine (cheese served in thin shavings topped with hazelnut praline and black truffle honey). Each course is matched with a thoughtfully selected wine pairing that enhances the dish. We splurged and requested the truffled ice cream sundae bar with white sturgeon caviar, which sounds bizarre but is truly genius (the way the caviar pairs with ice cream and ice cream toppings is so wondrous). While it is an additional $70/person, I highly recommend this.  Everyone at Pineapple & Pearls takes exceptional care of you. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with warm towels and a welcome cocktail. Our server was so attentive, friendly, and accommodating. We felt like we were the only people in the restaurant under their care. The staff was so thoughtful with their handwritten anniversary notes and the gorgeous cake they prepared for us.  Our meal was one of the most memorable (and we've had our share of expensive, noteworthy meals!), and it's something that we can share for a long time.",

What a refreshing change from other two and three star Michelin spots that charge double or even triple this amount.  The most standout part of my dinner experience was the service - everyone was friendly and so darn likable! You are greeted with a hot towel and a glass of dry cava while you wait. Then you go into a stunning dining room with an open kitchen. I especially liked the pearl-like light fixtures and the 3D wall art.  The presentation of the food was lovely, but the flavors weren\u2019t all there. Some dishes were under seasoned (Bass Veronique), and some were way too salty (Beggars\u2019 Purse). The Wagyu main was pretty forgettable. I did love the unique savory Pecorino Cake and Pesto Ice cream dessert.  For drink pairings, I liked the option of picking an \"eclectic\" or more traditional pairing. I got to experience both and thought the traditional pairing went with the meal better, though I enjoyed the eclectic options by themselves. My favorite drink was probably the rainwater Madeira.  After dinner, we got a tour of the kitchen and met Chef Aaron Silverman and the friendly GM. We were given bags with butter, jam, menus, and a handwritten note that I later realized was mass printed (very convincing though!)  Timing, while pretty good, was a little off at times. The total dinner time was just over three hours for our party of three - on the longer side for 10 courses.  Overall I had a fun experience at P&P and the staff was wonderful, I just wish the food were a little more memorable.",

Pro tip: there is no corkage fee if you sit in the main dining room or at the chef's counter. Also, we did the earlier seating (I think it was at 5:15), which worked out really well because we didn't end up finishing our meal until a little after 8 PM.",

I decided to treat myself to some fine dining but I was not drinking so I took advantage of the mocktail pairing which was amazing. I'm going to compare this to the neighboring Rose's Luxury and minibar, it is just as good. Not as crowded as Rose's Luxury. Like minibar, I had the eating at the bar experience but not the quirky atmosphere nor did I see the theater of cooking. The dishes range from tiny 3 bite items to dishes that are a bit heftier. They were mostly inventive dishes, such as the potato ice cream encrusted with caviar. There were several dishes, I don't remember how many, and I found myself very full at the end of the night. I was so full I had to get the last dishes to-go. Service was lovely.",

If I had unlimited money, this is the machinery I'd get! Sadly no custom pour overs.  The coffee was alright, a bit underextracted. The service was friendly, didn't try the pastries.  Would recommend a visit for sure!",

Not surprising given it's a project of the owner of the amazing Rose's Luxury right next door.  They also have a very small lunch menu with just 3-4 items, but each of them are AMAZING. I highly recommend either the fried chicken sandwich or the green garbanzo falafel sandwich. Both have incredible flavor profiles and must be experienced.",

        "caption": "Before you pick up your lap top bag and head over to Barracks Row hottest, newest coffee shop, just know that Pineapple & Pearls is a walk up coffee shop meaning there is absolutely NO seating and therefore no public wifi. If you know that going in, you'll have right expectations and will most likely LOVE this place.  As DC continues to \"New Yorkify\" (Thanks to Maketto for starting that movement), it only seems appropriate for Pineapple a& Pearls to open. It's a small coffee shop/pastry walk in from, by, and right next door to Rose's Luxury. It's simple and chic like New York City using a neo-modern beach theme. It's reminiscent of high class Charleston.  The two staff members behind the white marble counter are friendly and they may ask you if you've been in before, but not in a way that's a question. They ask it as if you for sure have been in before, but you haven't. Psychologically that makes you feel more connected to them as if they think you're familiar. It gives you a real sense that you are in fact invited and welcomed at Pineapple & Pearls. Even as a student of psychology, I fell for it and am already planning on my next visit.  They sell quality, artisan coffee as the Peregrine-esque menu boards tells you. However, unlike nearby Peregrine, Pineapple & Pearls sells chai latte and a darn good one at that. They also sell 6 pastries most of which are of the cinnamon roll variety. If you like chocolate and a little kick in the morning, order the Mexican chocolate cinnamon roll. It will come out from the oven warm oozing with Mexican chocolate. They'll give it to you in a clean, white bag, but ask for napkins....LOTS of them. You'll need it to wipe off the warm Mexican chocolate from your lips, chin, and in my case my eyebrow (I still don't know how that happened).  Pineapple & Pearls- Welcome to DC. I wouldn't be surprised if you get named \"Best New Coffee Shop in the USA.\" After all, you are the child of Rose's Luxury. Way to live up to the expectation and hype!  Now I need to go continue wiping that Mexican chocolate from my brow.",
