Fresh juices, coffee, Benedict and etc Today we ordered three Benedicts with smoke salmon with grill potatoes on the side :\" the first on the one menu\". Both orders were well presented. The bread they used on Benedict left me speechless, because its so yummy and fresh.  The servers are very friendly and helpful, great team!  Thank you. We will be back soon!",

Out of the infinite coffee shops in sunny isles and Miami, this place has accomplished the wondrous feat of standing out in coffee, decor, food, dessert, and that special uniqueness with their occasional but truly talented live musicians. I had a delicious cortado and a delectable cherry strudel that I now crave once a week. Of course, the service was also top notch and not just by speed and courtesy, but by a special attention that few cafes manage to accomplish. I've been here a few times and continue to look forward to each next visit!",

I'm absolutely in love with Wolsen caffe, not just because the aroma of the coffee when you open the door but I feel like I'm home sitting in my leaving room.  The moment you walk in, you get treated with a smile, now who doesn't love a smile right before you order a hot latte.  The decor is rustic and vintage, with beautiful laps all over the ceiling that gives Wolsen the romantic and cozy look. Don't worry about finding where to sit, Wolsen provided plenty of seating options. For a family of 2 to a family of 6. Your Choice of table or couch.  Wolsen Caffe has many option for coffee like lattes, americano, cappuccino and many more, everything is serve in gorgeous mugs that you just want to take home. They also offer wines from Cabernet franc, merlot, pink nori, pouilly fuisse and many more again in stunning wine glass that you wanna take home. Lol.  Now let's begin with the food options. I been here few times if it's for coffee or wine,but yesterday 06/15/17 I order a sandwich (tasty Italian) well it was tasty. Prosciutto, stracciatella, tomato and basil in a toast bread  with a side of salad and a home made dressing and yes I order a latte. The sandwich was just perfectly done and so tasty ( big enough to share). I left my discover card so I had no choice but to come back again and now that I was here, hey let's order breakfast why not. 06/16/17 I order (ooh toast) oh yes great choice for breakfast recommended by the owners son.  It had two sunny side eggs, pesto sauce, permesan cheese, tomato and toast... you can also share. Sandwich was excellent but it was to messy to eat.  My experience was just amazing. From the moment I walked in to the moment I left. Prices are great $4-$15 max for great quality food and amazing Service. I can't wait to visit again, which it will probably be soon. It's my backyard.  Perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner and just because I loveee coffee and wine.",
