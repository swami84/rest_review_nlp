The young lady went to the rest room and there was a guy cutting ham. I stood there for about 5 minutes and the guy didn't even acknowledge me. So I asked if he could come over so I can put an order in. He gave me a look like I was bothering him and said the young lady that went to the bathroom need to do her job. I asked him, well can you take my order? He came over to the register and in a bothered way said \"what you want?\" I started to walk out right there but I wanted the sandwich. So I placed the order and instead of preparing the sandwich, he went back to cutting han, still not saying anything like \"one moment, the young lady will be back to prep your sandwich\". 2 other people walked up wanting to place an order and the guy still proceeds to cut ham, not acknowledging the customers at all. The young lady came back and asked him, after seeing us standing there, was he waiting on her to come back? And he said \"yeah!\". She shook her head while proceeding to take the other orders and prepping the orders, while he continued to cut meat. I appreciate the young lady, who apologized for the wait, but the guy doesn't need to be working in customer service. He ignored the customers and when he didnt acknowledge them, he seemed bothered. In addition to all of this, I ordered a ham and egg sandwich on a croissant and I got a Turkey and egg sandwich instead. Customers should be the most important thing rather than cutting meat. Not the best experience this morning.",
