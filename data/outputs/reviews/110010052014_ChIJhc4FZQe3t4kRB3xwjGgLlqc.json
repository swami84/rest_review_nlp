The lobster in the Lobster tacos was so fresh and tender. Also very very flavorful. When picking up the food at the bar, I also ordered Mojitos (not an option for online ordering, which I wish it was) which were made perfectly; the only piece of constructive criticism that I\u2019d have to give is for the price of the Mojitos, I would\u2019ve appreciated a little bit of a larger to-go cup.

Our waitress was, Alexa, she was speedy with our drink orders and gave us ample time to order.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks and to be frank it was delicious and delivered a fresh flavor. For dinner I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Bowl. Though unlisted, it does come in a small for an individual order, otherwise the regular size would have been enough for 4 people. Thank you Alexa for that. The food was rather tasty and filling. Alexa's shift ended and we were given to another server...  After dinner, I ordered the Tres Leche, however it didn't really resemble what I anticipated. It was literally a block of corn bread, severely dry and overly spiced; the hint of cinnamon was overstated. It was topped with a tiny portion of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with a meager amount of caramel. It was unfinished. Upon the server's return I asked for a box for the remainder of spiced corn bread, the supposed Tres Leche, and asked if I can have more caramel sauce to go.  This is what really peeved me, the server exclaims that the caramel is the most important ingredient of this dessert and cannot be placed into a to go ramiken because the chef will need to prepare it from scratch. Really? He then goes on and explains to me the steps on making the dessert as if I had asked. I used to work as a sous chef and I'm certain the caramel is in fact in a filled squirt bottle, for easy use in topping and garnishing. In other words the server was too lazy to accommodate me. To go on and on with why he couldn't fulfill my request, tells a lot about their work ethic.  This would have been 2 stars if he was our initial server. Food was great but the service was questionable. Don't order the Tres Leche, it's not quite the same as what it should be.",

We walked up after receiving a text message saying our table was ready and no one spoke to or made eye contact with us for about 5 minutes. We watched them clean a bunch of tables off them finally, just as I was about to say something, a gentleman asked to take us to our seat while the hostess continued to ignore us as we stood right in front of her, strike 1 of the night. I immediately notice its larger than I expected and were taking to a little orange cave to dine. Someone came with water and to take our drink order pretty quickly but let us know there\u2019d be a small wait to receive our drinks because the bar was backed up. 35 minutes later we finally receive our pitcher of house margarita. We ordered two entrees and guacamole. Our food came out faster than our drinks but our guacamole never arrived and our waitress became a ghost. Our food was cold as it was brought to the table so I assume it\u2019s be hanging out in the back somewhere for a while. Starving and losing patience, we continued to eat our cold meal rather than take on the responsibility of hunting down our waitress or a manager, strike 2. We stop some other poor man as he\u2019s cleaning a table to ask about dessert and he lets us know all they have is a brownie sundae. Perfect, it\u2019s quick and simple. The sundae comes out the fastest of anything we ordered that night BUT the bottom of it is BURNT to a crisp. Again, no one stopped by to ask how our food was or if we were satisfied with our experience thus far, strike 3. It took another 15-20 minutes to hunt down our waitress for the check and guess what, we were charged for the guacamole that never came. She didn\u2019t apologize or flinch when she realized she\u2019s never checked on us nor brought out our food. She just casually took it off the check and charged us. We were in the restaurant for almost 3 hours and I can count the times our waitress came to our table on one hand, with fingers to spare. Once we finally left, I thought, at least my nachos were good, cold but delicious. WRONG. My friend and I spent the next several hours with HORRIBLE stomach aches. She was told the chili was vegetarian since she\u2019s a pescatarian, but we\u2019re almost sure there was meat in it and that\u2019s what caused her immediate discomfort. I on the other hand eat meat and nachos regularly and have NEVER had an adverse reaction like this. I won\u2019t be coming back until they do a full overhaul of staff and cooks. Hot food, cold drinks, and decent service come a dime a dozen in DC. If this place wants to survive, they have a lot of work to do. I also have yet to hear back from a representative of the restaurant despite reaching out as requested below.",

The manager came over, never apologized, stated the kitchen was busy and our food would be out in a few minutes. This felt like a lie bc people who came in after us had already gotten there food and left. More likely, our order was never put in. After waiting another 20 minutes, our group left.

After ordering them, we realized bartenders were looking at recipe sheets (under the register) for every drink.  Wait times were unnecessary, if the management focused on overall speed of service. Our server never returned after the food was delivered and our second round of drinks never made it by the end of the meal.  The food was expected and over priced comparable to the DC market.This restaurant has a long way to go to be on par with the numerous other options delivering better service, similar food. If bartenders need recipes for every drink, they should be in training...not serving on a Friday night.",

My main gripe is that the portions are absolutely tiny compared to the prices being charged -- for both food and drink. Nearly all of the specialty cocktails listed on the wall, which are once again on the smaller side relative to price, go for no less than $13, most around $14. In addition, a side of bacon for brunch is $4 for 1 slice of bacon and every other entree is just petite sized.  My most recent brunch visit I had the cornbread french toast, which having had the cornbread with a previous dinner and it being delicious, I was excited for. Perhaps having incorrectly thought \"cornbread french toast\" would be a \"french toast\" twist on the cornbread, I was sorely disappointed to find that it was literally the exact same cornbread served with dinner simply with sides of whip cream, honey, and pineapple -- at nearly double the already high side price for cornbread.  Having given this place multiple tries, I will not be back here unless they change the prices or serving sizes -- sad to say seeing as there's been a lot of excitement for both The Meatball Shop previously and now Mexicue. It seems that management has simply not realized that their prices are far too high for the area at this point.",

Everything looked amazing from the photos at the Chelsea location so I was excited because my beloved Meatball Shop, which previously operated out of this place, has closed.  Entering the restaurant, not much has changed from the last shop. Had a very awkward encounter with the hostess (?) who explained that since we didn\u2019t have a reservation, we could sit \u201ccommunity style\u201d with other people where you\u2019re basically at the same table but not. Since there were only two of us, we thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal.  We started with the seasonal guacamole which was guacamole, jalape\u00f1os and sesame seeds. This was basically two small scoops of guacamole for $12.50, which is an absurdly high price for such a small portion.  I ordered the kale and vegetable small plate and added shredded pork on it. I also got the romaine boat shrimp taco. The bowl was okay but pretty forgettable. The pork was VERY dry, like it had been sitting out for an hour or so.  The romaine boat taco was the highlight of the meal. The lettuce was crispy and the shrimp had a nice spicy flavor.  My boyfriend ordered a different bowl with barbecue pork and it was pretty decent but I think that\u2019s because the barbecue salsa/sauce was overpowering the rest of the bowl.  Prices are a little too high for this food to not be amazing, in my opinion. Service was okay. Charging nearly $12 for a bowl that is as big as my very tiny hand is crazy though.  Not sure I\u2019d come back unless it was for happy hour. Taco Bamba has way better quality at a better price point.",

I specifically wanted some queso so I decided to try mexicue again for the second time hoping to get some of their classic nachos but once again they didn't have something this time they didn't have queso lmfaooo I mean how hard is queso. I left and went to Chipotle down the block and got me a bowl and queso  . Sadly this place isn't making a first good impression. How hard is it to have the items listed on your menu in stock",

The pulled pork was tasty, but I thought the sauce on the brisket tacos were too much. I also loved the cornbread - sweet and accompanied with a savory hot butter. The brunch HH is a good deal at $6 for a Bloody Mary. Would totes return.  The restaurant itself is loud with poor sound insulation.",

We tried the seasonal charred cauliflower and the grilled avocado taco and both were delicious. Food comes in slightly spicy, but only to the point to boosting all the other flavors. We'll definitely come back!",
