We ordered the calamari and antipasti to share for our starter which arrived with a wonderful loaf of bread that was still wonderfully soft and warm (and even had the cocktail sauce, fresh sliced lemons and butter portions included). Our mains were Chicken Saltimboca which my husband wolfed down with a side of penne with a marinara sauce that tasted so fresh of tomato; I had the carbonara and we shared a side of garlic saut\u00e9ed broccoli which was equally tasty. Our dessert was then two wonderful portions of their tiramisu - perfectly light and fluffy. The portions are incredibly generous and gave us plenty for lunch the next day too (and they were still just as nice as the night before!) We had a lovely dinner on a special evening, despite the lockdown, and want to thank the restaurant and staff for making our evening so wonderful - we will definitely be visiting in person soon - thank you.",

Great wine selection. I wanted a specific wine from the menu but they were out. House wine was all they had. Ooooowee that house wine tasted like Wal-Mart Oakleaf wine. Wasn't very good.

Carrot cake and Italian cookies ended the evening on a sweet note. Service is friendly and efficient and the high ceilinged old room brings back a bygone era.

The menu covers a lot of ground, from grilled meats to veal and chicken to red sauce pastas - and usually a few daily specials - but I'm regularly drawn to the grilled vegetable platter, the homemade 8-finger cavatelli with rapini (and garlic!), and the grilled calamari and octopus. Small but well-chosen wine list. 10-seat bar for waiting or solo dining - or for a quick drink at intermission of plays next door at Artistic Home. Party room upstairs. Valet parking. Convenient to United Center for pre-game dining. Warning: full portions of pastas are truly gargantuan and can easily feed two or three people. Half-portions are still large, but you can try two or three and make everyone at the table happy.",

Within the 45 minutes that we waited, we also witnessed two other smaller parties that had a similar reservation mistake, and the host gave a similar response to them as well.
