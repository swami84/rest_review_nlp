Spices are not too much that you can feel and taste the very well cooked beef and sausage.  And the most important thing that I\u2019ve never had anywhere else in the USA but only @ Foda is the authentic and very well prepared \u201csalad water\u201d which is a must with any meat sandwich from Foda. I rate this place 10/10",
