This Chicago gem currently has locations in Logan Square & Roscoe village and now River West at  Westline food junction.  I enjoyed the croquetas which are hand rolled and stuffed with ham. These are one of my favorites and they tasted so good dipped in the house aioli.  I also recommend the picadillo (Beef) empanada. The flavors were really amazing and the dough had a perfectly crunch. I must also admit that the handmade corn tamal stuffed with juicy pork and topped with chimichurri & mojo was pure perfection. The tamal was really moist. I hate a try tamal.  I highly recommend the Cubano sandwich which is made with ham, roast pork, swiss, pickle & mustard. It was so delicious. In fact, Yahoo called this 1 of the Top 10 Cubano Sandwiches in the USA! Now I know why.  So if you're looking for some great authentic Cuban food. I highly recommend you order from this great family run business. You will not regret it.",
