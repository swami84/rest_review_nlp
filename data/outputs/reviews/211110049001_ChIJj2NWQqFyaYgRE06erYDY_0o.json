When I got home, I opened my sandwich and 2 gnats flew out.  The following Friday, I stopped to bring this to their attention.  The guy that was working found my receipt on the computer(the week before they asked me if I wanted me receipt, I declined since I didn't think I would need it) and made mentioned that he remembered me.  He didn't know how to refund my money, and I refused to eat food from that particular subway anymore.  He started to purchase a gift card with his own money stating \"the owner tells me to do it this way and then he pays me back\" I would not let him do that.  He then said he would call the owner/manager.  He came back and said that the owner manager said I could either get a replacement sandwich then or produce my receipt for a refund.  (Again, the previous week I was asked if I wanted my receipt and I declined).  I chose to left and decided to leave a bad review.  As this will more than likely cause others NOT to do business with this Subway  1st.  Do NOT eat at this subway-The food has bugs in it. 2nd.  Do NOT ask for a refund because you will not get it. 3rd.  If you do take your life into your own hands and go to this subway, ALWAYS ask for a receipt.  PS. As one review stated, it smells REALLY bad in this restaurant.  Like Urine",

All people, including the manager, stayed busy during my visit whether it was cleaning the dining area or preparing for the next group of customers.
