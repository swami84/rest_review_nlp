I called and complained and the manager politely replaced my order the following week.  I placed another order today and found a long strand of hair in the rice. I called the manager again and told him what happened and was told the problem was with me, not the food.

In my experience (and I eat A LOT of Indian food) this place offers GREAT quality DELICIOUS Indian food at very affordable prices !!! Lunch buffet selections are a little limited, true, but quality/taste is high !! At dinner time, EVERYTHING I've had has been delicious. Curries, Kormas, even Vindaloo (too spicy for my wuss-y palate, but still wonderfully tasty) all consistently earn very high marks !! The non-vegetarian appetizer is a meal in itself, with five different styles of meat (10 pieces total) all different, and each wonderful in its own way. And I've NEVER had a problem with the staff ... they've all been gracious and welcoming. This restaurant has been here for over 20 years, so they must be doing SOMETHING right !!! I am a big fan - ignore the haters and give them a try. You'll be glad you did!!!",

The servant or waitress was very polite and patiently explain some of the menu that were less familiar to us. I recommend the sword fish tikka masala and fish pakora.

The chicken korma is creamy and flavorful and everything korma should be, the rice is tender, the coconut soup is perfectly sweet, the masala tea is aromatic and warming, and the meat samosas were filling without being too heavy, although I wish they'd been a little spicier. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the garlic naan, but that's just a personal preference; I don't like cilantro and didn't think to ask about it. The delivery was estimated to take about an hour to an hour and a half, and was pretty much exactly an hour, and the delivery person was polite and pleasant.  In short, very good food at a very reasonable price with reliable delivery service. I'm happy I ordered from them, and will definitely do so in the future. I do wish they offered peshwari naan, though!",

I especially like their chicken tikka masala, onion kulacha, garlic naan and Mango lassy. The taste is close to what you would get in India, not exactly same though. Dont forget to tell them \"extra spicy\" if you are an indian :)  Ambience : 5 stars Staff and service : 5 stars Food quality : 4 stars",

I never hard restaurant charge extra 20% for damn plastic container!! after over paying for the food when I came home I found out they didn't even give me all the item, which they mentioned in their menu under veg thali and non veg thali. I called them back with my complain but staff was very rude. they denied their mistake and because I asked owners name and number they hung up on me. so pls stay away from that place unless wanna get ripped and get worst food..",

I only live about 2.5 miles a way...I should have just picked up my food but I didn't. When I called to find out the status of my order I was disconnected so I called back and the woman told me she'd call the driver. I told her to cancel my order and that I was coming down there to get my refund. I was again disconnected and received a phone call from the driver saying he couldn't find my house.
