It wasn't quite what I was expecting,  The wings had the relatively thick sauce poured over them after being placed in the to go box and were not tossed and coated in the sauce.  I agree with a previous review that the sauce was brown and gritty and was not a typical red buffalo sauce. I did not care for the sauce, I ended up scraping it off after the first two wings. I also had several wings with broken bones and two were broken through and just partial wings.  The blue cheese dressing also was a little different, had a brown tint to it and also seemed more gritty than smooth and creamy with chunks of blue cheese. I will say the wings were cooked nicely and were crispy on the outside.  If I were go back I would probably order the crispy wings with not sauce and see if they just has something like Franks Red Hot if I really wanted a sauce. Service was fine as I just picked up a to go order.",

First off, the sauces are very odd, maybe unique , but the medium sauce was brown and gritty and just weird to eat. Next, the majority of bones were broken, I eat alot of wings and have never seen so many broken bones. It was to the pint you probably wouldn't want a child eating the wings.

Over the last decade or so my family goes there as a treat for old school Phillies and wings. Last night I ordered 4 Phillies double meat and cheese with an order of 30 medium wings, over $110! It was the worst food we have gotten from anywhere! The wings were old and dry, just horrible and the subs were not the old style, were dry and had no flavor! Not juicy or even warm.. My family knows a good Philly and that last night was the opposite of that. The woman on the phone was very curt and not nice at all so I should have taken that as a sign. It cost a few bucks that\u2019s for sure but this family will never go to that restaurant for anything ever again. Talk about a nose dive, this food was as bad as it gets, I had to toss most of it and make frozen nuggets instead. My advice to you Wings n Things on arctic and 36th is if you\u2019re not going to care anymore and treat your customers this way, you should probably just roll up your operation before you destroy your reputation completely and anger the community with bad service and even worse food. Let somebody else have a business there and we\u2019ll just chalk it up to \u201cwas nice while it lasted\u201d overall I give one star!",

Their wings are what they\u2019re best at: Crispy, sauced and/or rubbed, either in Teryaki, Garlic Parm (my favorite), Mild, Hot, Extra Hot or Nuke (some of the hottest in town). Often, I find that some wings from other places are soggy and drowning in sauce, whereas these guys offer a crispy but flavorful alternative.  If you are looking for something other than the same ol\u2019 Chinese or (Sicily\u2019s) Pizza, give these guys a shot.",

Wings 'N' Things nights were some of my favorites, and after I left Alaska, those wings haunted my memories. I've tried hundreds of other restaurants' buffalo wings hoping for something like the wings of my childhood, but nothing has quite been the same.  Came back to Alaska this week for the first time since ~1995 and I'm happy to report that, other than this being a different Wings 'N' Things with a different location run by different owners, nothing has changed. The recipe is the same, these are the wings of my childhood.  They say you can't go home again, but today, I did. Thanks WnT!",

I have shared multiple pictures of it as a joke because of how small they are. I have honestly never seen such small wings in my life. When I called and complained, as I've been a patron since they were downtown, they told me if I've been eating there so long I should have expected the wings I got. I was informed I would receive a phone call the next day and of course I never did. Thoroughly disappointed as their wings do you have great flavor but the product I was given was unacceptable and the service I was given was less than courteous or could even have been considered hospitable.",

Friends arrive there at 2:30, but they can't find the order. 10 minutes later, order apparently found but would take another 10 minutes, no worries at this point, totally understandable on a busy day.  Friends were told that every 20 minutes until after 3:30pm.  Would have gladly just left and come back if they said they hadn't started...but waited until 3:30 to tell us that.  Still not worth leaving a negative review, until I called to cancel the order and employee puts the phone down, (look, just put it on hold next time, hell, even hang up lol) and proceeded to belittle myself and my still-waiting-inside-friends before coming back on, saying the order would be refunded and just hanging up.  Irritated (but stillll not enough to review online) I call back to verify it was cancelled, ask them to have a manager call me to verify when it was in fact cancelled because apparently nobody there could do it at the time, and of course to have them apologize about the awesome treatment over the first phone call.  Waited rest of day to leave this. Luckily for me, other places in the world make chicken so was able to purchase elsewhere. Those purchases already show up online and this one hasn't, leads me to believe it was at least canceled, wouldn't know for sure because I wasn't called. So I'll make it a 2-star just for the ability to at least not charge to waste 3+ hours of peoples time and because the wings are normally pretty good here.",

I used to pay $18 for a double (20 pcs) before but now have increased to $26! That's an $8 more and about a 30% price increase.  I thought it was a lot then before the price hike but since I like Wings N Things, I go there once in a while to get my fix on. Will I go back?, probably not. I think paying for about $1.30 for a piece of wing is a bit overpriced in my opinion.  I kind of missed the original owners when the location was still in downtown. A little small, but very welcoming ambiance, very nice employees, and the menu was reasonably priced.",

The boneless chicken was LITERALLY Tyson Popcorn Chicken, which I could have bought of bag of that for $7 instead of buying TWENTY PIECES of it for $20. My husband got the French dip. Sadly all it was, was meat and bread. The meat was VERY poor quality, there was no cheese on it and NO auju sauce. I thought it was supposed to be a French DIP. Unfortunately I ruined my husbands evening with this sandwich and the chicken for my kids sucked. First and LAST time wings n\u2019 things gets my money to feed my family dinner. I would have called the restaurant and demanded a refund when we got home. my husband opened his to-go box, and he asked me to not ruin his night anymore than it was already. Sucked.",

I can see why some people wouldn't like all the sauce and their small size, but they're perfect for me. One of the things that makes them my favorite is the lack of fat in their wings, which is mostly due to their small size. I hate fatty chicken wings and have never found another place besides Wings'N Things where this isn't a problem. It also helps that I love the unique sauce, so I don't consider the fact that the wings practically swim in it as being undesirable.

They were inedible had a bad smell and taste to them. Everyone that ate just one ended up in the bathroom after just eating one. When contacting the manager her customer service was just as bad as her wings. She argued with me as a customer, saying that everybody loves their wings.  We've been going to Wings-N-Things for over 20 years now, we've had a few times where the food was not up to par, but this time took the cake.  We ended up not being able to eat lunch, and the manager wouldn't even let us bring them back.  The manager was going to call us back, but it's been several hours since our initial call to her letting her know about our dissatisfaction.  We ended up going to Costco and getting chicken bakes for lunch for the office.  Having drove across town to get Wings-N-Things, not only was it a waste of time, & money, but also a waste of gas.  20 years of coming back to Wings-N-Things all down the drain.  We WILL NOT be going back to them.",

        "caption": "First time customer. So I call for a delivery and am told $5 delivery charge for the 1 mile drive to my location, so I decide to pick them up. I order 20 wings (hot). I picked them up and brought them back to work. What I can say is that first wing was about as dry as sandpaper, but when I got to the second one in the bottom of the container I discovered there was roughly enough grease in there to fry a turkey. These are the most vial wings I have ever eaten in my life and will never give this place my money again. I should have know when I walked into this huge restaurant with seating for I'm guessing 100 or so and there were 5 people in there at high noon that something wasn't good....amazed this place is still in business pedaling a product like that.",

        "caption": "Ok,I was one of the customers that wings and things had loved. I told everyone to go there, I ate there, \"sometimes three time a week.\" And I spent a lot of money there as well. The old spot was better. When the new spot opened up, they had it. They were doing good. Started to feel like they had just, went on a vacation for a bit and opened up in a new spot.Then they had friends and family working for them or something. Cause they thought that they were doing so good they took on the whole other left side of the empty spot next to them. The food started getting bad cause they had to start buying cheaper less meatier wings. And cheaper ingredients. How can one make any money, when you loose more then is coming in.My advise to this place is, go back to the basics.The old place was small. We liked that, made us feel like we were eating grandmas wings.The old place made daily and fresh. If you didnt make it in time for your favorites. Then you had to try again the next day. \"Kinda adds to the cravings one whould have for there favorites. Why all the tv's....?Im sorry I'm there to eat some good food. Not watch the news or some game or the soap the gal behind the counter was so into.How about a nice song playing. Some kind of new decor.Ill end by saying, I as a long time costumer, Will in three month, if they haven't closed by then. Will go and see if thing are the same. If so, I will no longer be that customer.",

The cashier was even proud to boast that is the way they cook them!! Unreal. And the hot wings were drenched in cayenne sauce as the cooks' technique to ensure their customers were unable to even eat those darn dried up things. Next time I will spend more time reading the reviews on here before trying a new place. Do not bother wasting your money at the Wings & Things on Arctic Road.",
