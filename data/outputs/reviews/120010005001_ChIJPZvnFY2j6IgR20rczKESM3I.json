I was immediately seated and the service was impeccable and the people were very friendly and the chef came out several times and stopped to have a conversation. On top of that the food was absolutely amazing. The bread is fresh and I had the grouper and it was like nothing I'd ever had before. The sauce was amazing and the grouper was the biggest thickest piece of fish I've ever seen. The side of pasta seemed like a second thought as it had a different sauce on it so I didn't bother with that. Probably would have eaten it if it was in the same sauce as the grouper was. The locals that were next to me that I had a conversation with had all wonderful things to say about them as well and the dessert which I never made it to because I ate so much of the fresh bread. I would highly recommend that everyone visits this place at least once a visit.",

Absolutely one of the best dining experiences I\u2019ve ever had. If you want dessert recommendations: get the almond custard, it\u2019s to die for. It comes with these dark, slightly sour cherries and cherry sauce on top, and it\u2019s served in an edible bowl. I also ordered the tortellini alfredo, and it was amazing; soft and fresh pasta plus rich cheese, none of that frozen, rubbery garbage. If I could give this place more than five stars I would.",

The salads were fresh and beautifully presented. It was hard to decide on our dinner entrees because of so many excellent choices, but we both decided on the grouper with lemon sauce, capers, and Greek olives - outstanding! The portion was very large, and the entree came with a side dish of ziti in marinara sauce - also excellent. If we are ever back in Gainesville, we will definitely return to Amelia's.",

My fiance actually proposed to me here and it was perfect. The owner/chef made rounds to check on each and every guest. The atmosphere is romantic and relaxing.

The customer service is always impeccable and the bread selection they provide before your meal is always baked to perfection.

No one told us about that, no one pointed it out when we got the check, and it's definitely nothing other restaurants do in this area. This felt a bit weird. Hence the 3 stars.",

My daughter goes to school here now at UF so I am sure to come here every time I\u2019m in town. I have the veal Sorrentino last night and it was amazing. Last time I had a different veal dish and it was also amazing. Their sauces are bursting with flavor. Even their bread inside pasta dishes or flavor bombs. The bread is crispy with rosemary and salt.  If you haven\u2019t gone here yet you have to try it out. You will not regret it. I love this place- I even came here alone last night because my wife was too tired to go",

I've been here before and the food was absolutely delicious, so I was excited to take my friend here when she came to town. It was about 6:45 on a Thursday night and the restaurant was not too busy when we got there--we were hoping for outside seating since it was such a beautiful day out (there was no one outside at all). Well, we waited for 5 minutes before anyone came to the front, which was fine. However, we were met by a man who appeared to be a chef that asked us brashly \"do you two have reservations?\" I said no, because it's a Thursday night, not their typical busy Friday or Saturday, to which he responded with (in a very rude and annoyed tone): \"well we only do reservations now, you'll have to come back at 8,\" and he walked away before I could even say anything. I even checked the website to see if it said reservations only, but it doesn't. I don't appreciate the fact that my friend and I appeared to be judged by him since we're 20-something year old college students. I will not be returning to this restaurant due to the treatment I received.",

It was funny we were kinda disappointed at the size of the lasagna piece but that completely went out the window when we had our first bite.  Both times I've gone have been for friends' birthday celebrations. They were not disappointed! For birthdays, the chef comes out with his saxophone and serenades the birthday person!! He also goes out of his way to ask how everything tasted. The chocolate cake we had for the birthday girl was pretty yummy too!  The restaurant is located in a cute little area of downtown Gainesville. It feels homey!  p.s. Can't wait to go back for more lasagna!",

PLEASE try the Crostini for an appetizer, OMG will be the words that actually come out of your mouth when you try it! They bring a selection of hot bread to the table, not just one kind, usually 3 different kinds which are all very yummy and warm. The Surf and Turf, I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it is. Andy makes this most delicious blue cheese sauce to go with your perfect cooked steak, potatoes and shrimp. WOW. The Salmon Almondine, when its on the menu, you can not pass up on trying it. The salmon is cooked to perfection served over a bed of spinach, garlic grapes with this savory white sauce over it all. Just writing this review is making me hungry. They also have an amazing selection of wines to choose from and their dessert menu will not disappoint you! Make sure to try them out when you have the chance! Love you guys at Amelia's!!",

We paired that with Moscato recommended by our server. For the main course,  I had the lasagna which was an enormous portion (made really tasty leftovers), the sauce was mild not too acidic. My husband had the surf and turf, again enormous portions. Had to box that yummy goodness up to make room for desserts. I choose the chocolate mouse cake and my husband had the flan...both very delectable. I would highly recommend this establishment to anybody who prefers real Italian food, great service and good prices. I don't recommend bringing the kids, definitely nice and cozy for a romantic dinner.",
