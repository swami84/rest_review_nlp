        "caption": "Welp. I must say I was pretty disappointed. Last time I was here with my friend the service was slow but at least we got what we ordered. On a Tuesday evening when its not very busy we waited for a while to be served, then we take our order and wait again until I had to pay for another 40 minutes for my car to be parked in the street. We then got our food and it was okay. No complaints on my crab cakes. However when we were done I told the waiter I wanted the make your own smores thing. Instead got fondue for 2\ud83d\ude15 . I mean smores and fondue dont even really sound similar so im confused how that mix up could happen. The real kicker though was the food for the fondue. (remember we wanted the smore thing not the fondue thing) You could tell that the food on the dish was pretty old. The strawberries looked like they been in the fridge for more than a week and a half. Not to mention bits of mold on one of them. The pretzels were stale and looked a bit wrinkly? If your pretzels are wrinkly that means its time to switch them out for fresher ones lol. However the brownie was good and the bananas were good also. Unfortunatly the main reason why I wanted to go to the chocolate bar was for the make your own smores because of how different and unique it is. So was it worth the very long wait? (we were there for probably more than a hour and a half with only a few people in the restaurant), no I wouldn't say so. Would I come back? Until i hear that the service is a bit faster. \ud83d\ude15",

I was never asked how I wanted my burger, but it came out burnt. My girlfriend's crab cake turned out good though, the waiter then brought out the check but forgot our dessert.  We asked about the dessert and the waiter brought out the wrong dessert; she then apologized and said she had a case of the Monday's (It was Tuesday though)  The dessert she brought out was more expensive then what we ordered, and had stale pretzels, stale vanilla wafers and moldy/old strawberries.  Never were we asked if everything was going well, we never got a water refill (till I asked about it), and in total it took longer then than an hour after everything was said and done.  Keep in mind we were the last ones there, and it wasn't packed at all. Personally, I think they thought that because we are a young couple that they could get away with poor service.",

Sorry but never again. Cute idea though!  Also! I feel they need new leadership. Here's a tip mac and cheese should have cheese and be tasty. It was bland and dried out. And if your going to be a \"manager\" you should act like one and dress like one. He bashed his own staff saying the cook is \"new\" and he had so many call offs. But hunny it dosen't take much for some mac and cheese and a diet soda. Hilarious!  there wasn't any bubbles in the soda and he says \" looks like we ran out\".

Unacceptable! Will go back for the drinks, but thats about it! My bill was over $200 for 3 people-we would expect our order to be right and not have inedible things in it.

Previously it was made with homemade pasta not boxed bow tie. It came with corn and a toast this time it has a tiny sprinkle of bacon on top. It didn\u2019t taste like much. I normally get the creme brulee, but they don\u2019t offer that anymore either. A majority of the menu was removed when they reprinted. The appetizers were left off and were significantly reduced. I was really disappointed. I loved how the food was prior to the revamp of the menu and restaurant. Also, it seemed as though they didn\u2019t want us to eat there due to no reservation, however they only had one table of two people that was taken. It was super empty.",

This wasn\u2019t even their fault, yet they cared enough to make it up to me (It was carrot cake and it rocked). The food was still appropriate temperatures when it came, and we loved everything. The cocktail was amazing and came with the cutest presentation. My to-go bag even had a dollar bill in it with an apology note since they accidentally over-charged for a salad upgrade (that I would have never noticed otherwise).

Both of us had always heard good things and were excited to go and see for ourselves. We arrived around 7:20pm and told the hostess we were there for our reservation, in which she hesitated and said I will get a table cleared for you. If we had a reservation, why wasn\u2019t a table set up for it? The place was very small and downstairs was already pretty full so we figured we would be placed upstairs. Wrong. Instead we were seated in a small corner near the bathrooms, UNDER A STAIRWELL. The table had an extremely bright light in our faces and it was at least 80 degrees in the restaurant. The menus were ripped up but decided to look through it. We then talked and decided that we would not be staying here for our special night and left. We both are very disappointed and won\u2019t be going back.",

It's a great place to go with a group who likes dessert style drinks. The food is just okay but the drinks make up for what the food doesn't. The drink menu is extremely expensive with many different categories of chocolate drinks. I've enjoyed every type that I've tried. I especially like the peanut butter cup martini and the salted pretzel martini. They offer flights so you can try a couple of them also. Definitely worth stopping by for drinks but I would eat dinner elsewhere. The drinks are pricey but worth it when you realize how strong they are.",

I came here for my birthday, waited 45 minutes for our drinks, got our food, friend found a hair in it. We complain, the waitress inspects the food like a detective. Couldnt just say im so sorry and take it. She gets something else, another 20 minutes. We ordered more drinks and dessert. Another 45 minutes for our drinks, got our dessert. Found a hair in my cheesecake, i went downstairs to speak to the manager about this ridiculousness. The manager gets to me, starts by listing off the things we are getting for free and asked \"so what else is wrong\" so i tell him i found another hair in my dessert. He asks \"well where is it?\" I tell him at the table so he said \"so lets see\" and proceeds to walk to my table to inspect it like the detective waitress before him. I asked, why do you need to see it? Do you not believe me? And then proceeded to tell me and my family that the first dish didn't have a hair in it. Couldn't just say he was so sorry, ill take care of you. He and the waitress just were literally challenging us. I've been here so many times, now for my birthday, what do i or we get for having not finished our food and have a terrible time? It was so insane to be treated like that after having been here so many times. That definitely will change.",

Had to catch the attention of another waitress to refill drink.  Pitchers of water were never refilled . We did not receive clean silverware and napkins with our desserts and had to ask for them after sharing leftover spoons from dinner amongst ourselves. This was a birthday celebration but I do not think we will be celebrating at the Chocolate Bar anytime soon.",

I thought for sure dessert would redeem it, and we got that to go. I got the turtle cheesecake and when we got back to our hotel I was pretty disappointed upon opening the box, to my surprise it was a plain piece of cheese cake with a to go sauce dish with toppings in it. It tasted ok but this is not what was described on the menu. The menu clearly says this is a marbled cheesecake, and it definitely isn\u2019t. See the picture. Plain cheesecake. Not marbled. Tasted ok but would have been better if as described. The service was pretty good though. The waitress was very nice.",

Waited an hour and a half and our food wasn't even up yet. The place wasn't even that busy for a Saturday evening. Paid for our drinks and left hungry for our 8pm show at Shea's. No apologies or discounts or anything. Several other tables there this evening in similar situations. Some waited over an hour plus just for desserts. This place has really gone down hill.

Literally everyone else in the restaurant got their drinks and food before we did. It has been an hour now, and we still don't have our food. The staff's excuse is that we didn't reserve a table -- a reservation gets you a table when it's busy-- not preferential treatment when it isn't busy at all -- orders should still be taken first come first serve. Patrons shouldn't be absolutely ignored and forced to wait an hour + for service, no matter how they came in. Awful",

We didn't get our food until an hour after arrival. -atmoshphere of restaurant is pretty good.  Partially a dark/industrial theme. -While not 'filthy' at all, the place can use a bit of updating. some of the hanging decorations were noticable to have a layer of dust on them, and the couple benches/booths they had (we sat in one) could be updated or replaces with newer ones. -Finally, the food. It was OK to good not great. Nothing wrong with it...we were not unhappy with it, but nothing to wow you with quality. With a little extra attention and some upgrades this place would get a star rating from me, but for now it's a 3.

Well...until you get to the Chocolate Bar. I guess my first mistake was thinking I'd receive good service at a high end martini bar. The second mistake was thinking they'd care enough to make the experience right. After one of the longest Mondays of my life, all I wanted was a quick bite to eat, so I go into this place, after walking by it daily for the last 5 weeks, and ask if they have food to go. The bartender says \"yes,\" so I order the Mediterranean salad with chicken instead of shrimp. This was ar 8:15. By 8:45 I still didn't have my order so when I asked the bartender how much longer, she told me she'd check. When she comes back, she apologizes and tells me that the cook never informed her the salad was ready and told me not to worry though because she made sure there was chicken on it like I ordered. So while the other bartender is ringing me up, I open the container to double check and find that the chicken is cold! So of course I inquire if this is normal and her exact response was \"oh I don't know if its supposed to be cold, I've never had it!\" Well um anyone who waits 30 minutes for a salad knows the chicken is supposed to be warm! After walking to my car, I realized I didn't want to pay $12 for a salad I had to wait 30 minutes for that has cold chicken on it so I go back and ask them for a refund. Well don't you know the manager has just stepped out for a coffee run and was the only person with the ability to refund my card. Now I get it, everyone is entitled to a break, but you'd think the bartender would have offered to make me a fresh salad while I waited. NOPE! After 10 minutes the manager returns and refunds my money after giving me some speech about how the cook never told the bartender the food was ready. You would have thought after waiting 45 minutes, she'd offer me to keep the salad since they have to throw it away anyway, but apparently that wasn't even a thought in her mind! What a joke! I'll never be back and will be sure to share my horrible experience.",

Admittedly I cannot speak to the food since we went for the martinis and manicures thing that they do on mondays but the drinks were fabulous. I had the birthday cake martini and my sister ordered the raspberry mojito. She's not a huge fan of alcohol but she loved that mojito (and I can vouch that it was amazing too since I tasted her drink). My martini was really delicious too. The bartender was nice and she was pretty funny and if i remember correctly, i believe she mentioned that she had recently adjusted the mojito recipe (something about the old recipe needing work I think). Her new recipe was amazing as I said above and it obviously shows that she knows her craft well. She was also taking time to teach one of the hostesses or servers to mix as well which made an impression on me because she was kind enough to share her knowledge (I've heard and seen how cutthroat bartending can be and I was pretty pleasantly surprised to see her helping other staff to learn). Bar was comfortable to sit at and everyone there that we spoke to seemed nice with great customer service.",

Meals took another 45 minutes. My medium steak was totally rare. No one came to ask. After we were ready to pay, it took another 45 minutes. I gave the waitress my credit card because I needed to leave, and told my group to get it back for me. She had had it for 35 minutes. And a manager promised us 20% off our checks to be nice, but then came back almost a half hour later saying she couldn't figure out how to do it. The food was okay (many orders wrong), the bathrooms were gross and dimly lit. This was a very poor experience considering it was supposed to be a nice get together and it was expensive and on a weeknight. Only giving 2 stars because they did try to compensate us. Hopefully will have a better experience if I ever choose to go back.",

We were seated upstairs overlooking the lower level. Nicole was our server.  We ordered drinks and when they arrived we ordered dinner.  I was impressed with both the food and the service. Nicole had no upstairs station so whenever a patron needed something she had to go downstairs.  She had no problems with multi tasking and we truly enjoyed the evening.  The food was hot .... Well cooked and delicious.  The drinks are a bit pricey but serve as both a relaxing drink and decadent dessert. Overall, a truly perfect place for a downtown dinner.",
