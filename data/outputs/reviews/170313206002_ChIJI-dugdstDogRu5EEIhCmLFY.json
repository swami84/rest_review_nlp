They have a special of $32 for the mimosa brunch, which is a great deal because it's bottomless with any brunch item. Their omelets are not behemoth but they're not small either. Perfect amount. The avocado toast with the egg was delicious and the bread they used was so delicious and hearty, a nutty multigrain slice. Coffee was a nice blend of medium dark roast. Near the bar is fun but they have a back dining area by the kitchen, nice lighting, and the staff are attentive. Why not 5 stars? It's the small things but not an entire deal breaker...the bacon was cut too thin and I could do without the unwanted ketchup bowl with my breakfast potatoes. Again, it seems petty but this review won't let me do 4.5 stars soooo 4 stars it is. Anyway, if you're looking for something sweet Petit Vanille is attached and they have a small curated selection of items to grab - macarons, croissants, cake etc. Definitely coming back to their dinner or lunch.",

We walked into an empty restaurant on a Monday night and we had a reservation. First, there was no one at the door. 5 min later someone bothered to come sit us (there were plenty of empty tables but they put us on the worst one by the kitchen). 1 person ordered a beer, others asked for a couple of minutes. The beer never arrived and no one ever came to ask if we were ready to order for 30 min. One waiter walked past us, completely absorbed in his phone, not looking at anyone trying get his attention. I had to go up to the front and finally found a person at the bar who notified me that while the restaurant is empty, they were busy providing room service for the hotel next door (really?! why should that be my problem?). Finally, 45 min after the arrival we managed to place an order in a still empty restaurant. The food is ok, given the disastrous service, it is overpriced for a South Loop location. Do not waste your time and money going here.",

Staff was friendly and service quick but it absolutely felt like we were in a hotel breakfast room. Chicago has overcome this stigma, but LM somehow still brings it to their spaces.  The Royal Benedict with salmon was really good. Coffee really good, hash browns cooked well, and breakfast meats of quality. The croissant bum was amazing! More of those, but offer preserves like a proper French petite dejeuner.  I want to love and support the LM restaurants but continue to be disappointed. Still we'll probably visit again.",
