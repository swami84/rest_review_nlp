Right before we were about to leave the owner Kate who has such a sweet, genuine personality gave me a sample of the ravioli. That was the best ravioli that I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life. It actually tasted like how pizza tastes from Italy. The food is so good. The food is filling, but doesn\u2019t make you feel bloated or tired. It\u2019s nice and fresh. You can tell that the chef uses the best ingredients to make his food. The prices are reasonable as well. This is a great date spot. Great meeting spot for friends or whatever you like spot. We\u2019ll definitely be back. You should definitely try this place out!!! 5\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\u2018S up Kate.
