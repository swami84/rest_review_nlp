I was hoping to find something comparable to my Bushwick neighborhood pizza place, Archie's Pizza & Bar. I spotted Uncle Tony\u2019s pizza sign and liked the blue pizza graphic, so I decided to check it out. The space is quaint, cool, minimal. Staff was friendly and fast. The Sicilian looked good but I went with the Bosco, which had wild mushrooms, ricotta, rosemary, mozzarella and truffle drizzle. It was quite tasty and I can tell they source quality ingredients. The slice was a decent size but I only had one. I would probably need another to feel satisfied. For the vegans out there, they have a vegan slice. If I'm ever in the area again, I\u2019d stop through Uncle Tony's again.",

One of the pies we ordered was \"The Supreme\" which is supposed to have bacon, meatball, sausage, and jalapeno. We also added pepperoni on the whole pie. The total for that pie alone was $34.20! For that price, I would expect it to be overloaded with toppings. The jalapeno and pepperoni were sparse. I could barely discern the sausage and meatball. And I'm not convinced there was actually any bacon on it at all! There's a great pizzeria in New Haven (I have family there) that does a similar pizza for a lot less and then are not messing around with those toppings. I was expecting something similar if not more over the top for this price but we were sadly disappointed. I would never order this pizza again!  ****  No DiFara's (but what is) but it's a solid neighborhood slice. Haven't ordered a pie for delivery yet but was happy with pepperoni Sicilian slice we got when we walked in. Will definitely order from them in the future and am happy to have them in Hamilton Heights.",

Great location right across the street from City College but I think the prices are pretty high, especially for a place where the main customers are college students.

It's very aesthetically pleasing inside the restaurant though and there is always great music playing. My main complaint is that there is only one type of vegan pizza and it is not the best. It's great in a pinch as the area doesn't have many easily accessible vegan friendly options...but there could be more variety with it.",

When we were ready to order, we told her what we wanted, half regular half supreme, but she said we had to buy half supreme and half Sicilian, so they wouldn't have to make a new pizza, that cost us an extra $5 for the pizza we didn't want. When I asked her what it was, she had no idea, and then after reading the menu she just pointed at the pizza and said it's that. She couldn't tell us what drink flavors they had either. When we got The pizza, four of the pieces were completely black on the bottom. When we finished, we cleaned our own table, and threw away all our trash, except for the pizza box which wouldn't fit in the can, so we gave to her. This was such an inconvenience to her that she let out a very audible frustrated sigh as she came to take the box from us. In reality the unburnt pizza was very good, and I am very happy they used unbleached flour and organic tomatoes. Terrible service from the one employee paid to interact with us.",

Absolutely delicious!  Please support this place.  To my fellow CUNY staff and students, help them succeed!  Great pizza!  Strange it's called \"Uncle Tony's!\"",
