For the same price as a McDonald's breakfast value meal, I can get a similarly-sized meal at Leon that's arguably much better for me, more tasty and leaves me more nutritionally full for a longer time. A few menu items are a bit of a miss for me, like the gluten-free baked chicken nuggets, but that's subjective - I like my nuggets breaded and fried. But overall, I like Leon, and I still keep coming back for breakfast.",

I took one star because there wasn't as much flavor as I would like. The chicken didn't have much seasoning, so I doused it in the chili sauce, which helped a little. I'd definitely go back to try their other options, but I wouldn't order the chili chicken hotbox again unless I was going out of my way to be healthy. It wouldn't be for taste.

Enjoyed the lemonade but unfortunately the fries and nuggets were very stale. Kind of tasted like they had been sitting for a while and were barely warm. If they were fresher it\u2019d probably taste better.",

        "caption": "Leon is a better-for-you fast food chain from the U.K. This location is their third in Washington, D.C. It's a large space across the street from the McPherson Square Metro Station in downtown. Here's what's to love:  1) Food: They have a MASSIVE menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with many options from wraps to sandwiches to fries to sweets (sourced locally). For breakfast, I enjoy the full English breakfast in the mornings (it comes with baked beans). Their halloumi and avocado muffin is also great. For lunch, their burgers are good and they even have a vegetarian burger that is really good.  2) Coffee: They brew it throughout the day. It's cheap. It's creamy when you want it to be and they have many different types of creamers to put in it (almond milk, etc).  3) Options: They have many items for vegetarians, vegans, and pescatarians.  The staff are usually friendly and you can always find a place to sit. They have unique, local art on the walls including a few murals.",
