Most green juices that I found in Chicago aren't organic, and the few that are often have too much sugar. Supermarket options are often pasteurized. That is why I was very happy to find the Supreme Green juice from Juicerx- it has the highest concentration of greens that I have found to date. I like that the taste is not too sweet and it didn't give me a hypoglycemic effect that other juices often do. I'm a bit OCD about nutrition, esp the amount of sugar and sodium I am consuming, however a lot of juice bars do not provide these kinds of information. So I was very happy to see that every Juicerx bottle has detailed nutritional information on them  On top of that, the customer service is incredible. They happily helped me set up weekly delivery, and when an item is out, the owner himself would contact me to apologize and offer replacement. I cannot recommend this place high enough.",

Right off the bat, I was impressed by the customer service of the company. I was able to customize my cleanse a bit (there were quite a few flavors I wanted to try, and Dean was kind enough to substitute them into my cleanse). During the cleanse, I felt much better than anticipated. Were food commercials difficult? Yes. But I wasn't terribly hungry. In fact, I found I only needed about 4 of the 6 daily juices. And let's talk about the juices themselves. Way better than anything I've ever made in my juicer. The Watermelon Mint (with lime and sea salt) was absolutely amazing. I could drink that every day. The Evening Green was the best green juice I have ever tried.",
