Only bad thing i can say which makes me give them 4 stars is that they dont have a digital menu/ record keeping system which sucks what ever they write on the board is what you can see. Everything is paper so imagine if they lose the paper reciept there's  no way on how to find your order terrible we are in 2020 they need to get a better system  please i love you guys but ya are killing me lol. And last thing i never seen a menu and they never have. Other than that they pretty good. Oh p.s another bad thing if you make a purchase and you want to pay with your credit card they make you go to the store the same day or following day to pay if not theres no order for you to pick up on the day you schedule.",
