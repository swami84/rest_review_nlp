If you order a cheesecake (albeit one that is stated to come with chocolate) there should be some actual cheese (and perhaps shouldn't more closely resemble a mousse or pot de cr\u00e8me). There is an argument to be made for ordering different dishes. My mother's fish on papillote was delicious and far better for the relative lack of accoutrements. The service was ok, but became noticeably better after we ordered alcohol (this is a pet peeve of mine: you should treat your guests the same if they order Dom or tap water).

FYI If you will have a party of 6+, get the disco ball for you alcoholic drink.  The veal entree: very tender and full of flavor. Probably the best dish on the menu! The calamari appetizer: can be shared between 2 ppl and is fried. The sauce may be spicy. The Scallop and fettuccine pasta: Very flavorful the pasta includes squid ink. Delicious \ud83d\ude0b The potato side: It can be shared with up to 3 ppl. The potatoes are lightly salted with a slight crunch on the outside. The broccoli and cheese appetizer: Dijon mustard on the bottom, broccoli in the middle, and melted cheese on top. It was surprisingly delicious. The flounder entree: It was baked in a bag like a boil, but there wasn't much flavor. The chicken and spaghetti entr\u00e9e: the chicken is fried and placed on a separate plate. The sauce is separated from the spaghetti, so nothing gets soggy. Definitely #2 on the menu. The sauce was very robust and full of flavor.",

So when we came back into town for our anniversary weekend, we immediately set up a reservation. The second dining experience was pretty disappointing to say the least. Service was slow. Like over 10 minutes waiting at our table with no one checking on us when we first sat down until I asked the hostess if we had a designated waiter. Then we waited again for over 10 minutes when our plates were cleared and we just wanted our check. Our waiter did not follow up with drinks or check on food quality. Pork belly appetizer was good but it was served to us cold.  It really wasn\u2019t that busy either..it was a Sunday night. Not sure if it was just an off night but we probably won\u2019t come back again.",

The atmosphere is fancy with slights of promiscuity; tastefully done. The staff radiate confidence  while still remaining in the background as to allow your own experience to flourish just like your tastebuds will do. Bailey specifically knows the ends and outs and her personality beams with a joy that makes you want to try everything on the menu and then some, she has a way with words. If possible I suggest you request her. She can handle small parties with rambunctious goblins ( my six month old son ) or guide you and an entire brunch/dinner party through an exploratory tasteful adventure filled with explosions and paired dishes that will literally blow your mind.  Also if she suggests a dessert, take the suggestion. She\u2019s knows something we don\u2019t and whatever it is, it\u2019s magic.  Whether you\u2019re visiting or you reside here in New Orleans this is the place, just go and thank me later!!!",

If you can\u2019t accommodate all of my guests then I won\u2019t dine with you. Am I gonna tell those 4 people that they can\u2019t come? HELL NO!

We spent Christmas dinner here and the menu was a prefix menu which was fine. Ambiance was great and the hostess was friendly. We could barely hear our waiter and he was not overly friendly just very to the point... I had to say \"what?\" After everything he said and was never asked if I wanted another beverage. The food is what we were so excited for and like I said it was a huge disappointment...kind of like the chef didn't even show up. Every dish needed major salt and every dish was room temperature (even my soup and bread pudding- everyone of the dishes we ordered should have been hot). The plates weren't even warm, they we're cold. I ordered the duck as my entree and not only was it also just room temperature, there was absolutely no sear on it to crisp it up or make it more flavorful.  At $65+ a person I really expected ALOT more! We won't be returning or recommending this restaurant.",

My staple starter is the Steak Tartare with a cracked egg on top, but you really can't go wrong with anything they serve.  Their attention to detail is above and beyond other \"quality\" restaurants in New Orleans and they have a superb host staff.  Ariana's smile is infectious as you walk up to the host stand and you can't help but feel like you are greeted by an old friend.  If Emery is there, you won't ever want to leave. She makes you feel so welcome and special.  If you are lucky, ask for Deborah or Jenna, as your server.  Deborah is so proficient with a fun, energetic undercurrent of joy.  Jenna is your super sweet, knowledgeable server.  Go for the food and the amazing drinks, but stop and live in the moment.  Become part of New Orleans, while at Jack Rose, you won't regret it.

        "caption": "The decor, ambiance, and staff were all well above average. There's also a great music playlist -- eclectic and creative rock mix. I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the food. I was brought bread that was described as being \"right out of the oven\" that was room temp and tough. My shrimp & okra gumbo (as a Louisiana native, I'm admittedly a tough critic here) was tepid and slightly sweet(?). The Black Angus daube in the eponymous entree was tender and delicious, but the vegetable accompaniment of carrots and fingerling potatoes was uninspired and lacked seasoning to speak of. Last, the blueberry bread pudding sounded great, but also arrived room temp and dry (I've never had a bread pudding that wasn't at least warm), with the blueberries piled on the side rather than fully integrated into the dish. The wines-by-the-glass list was also a major disappointment for a restaurant of this purported caliber -- pedestrian and short on creativity, and lacking in printed details. I may give this place a second chance (the staff really was attentive and pleasant) and try some other items, but there are just too many other great restaurants in New Orleans for me to recommend Jack Rose at this point.",

The paneed veal for 2 was big enough for 4 but so great I\u2019m glad we had leftivers!   We went back twice in the same week. The food, the service and the atmosphere made it our new favorite plsce to go.",

We had the most amazing meal.  3 different appetizers and each one was better then the next, which of course the new Octopus dish being the one i loved the most.  Then we moved on to our Entrees and I ordered the soft Shell Crab which was to die for and i'm normally not a soft Shell Crab Person and my friend had a pasta piccata dish that was so delectable we both finished everything on our plates.  But of course we couldn't leave with out having dessert. She had a grapefruit cake and i had this chocolate ice cream with chocolate covered raisins (mine was so good i want more) all in all this was an incredible experience and our waiter Barry made it so much more fun! thanks so much for such a great time, i can't wait to go back!!!",

        "caption": "Jack Rose lived up to all my expectations for great food, exceptional service, and unique design, and it also nailed that rare, hard-to-define quality: it was a damn good time. The place just has a great energy and everyone around me seemed to be having a blast. That's apparent from the moment you step into the \"living room,\" which now serves small plates along with cocktails, wine, and beer. It's a cool room (no doubt you've already seen somebody's selfie with the Lil Wayne portrait on Instagram), and it works really well as a place to hang with a group and meet other people. You could easily make a night of eating and drinking in this space. But the main attraction is the \"dining room,\" which shares the same vibe and liveliness but with an expanded menu. The entrees are diverse (my two favorites, Pompano en Papillote and Chicken Parmesan, are a good example of this), but everything I had was successful, aka scrumptious. The dessert menu is also a real standout (Fluff-A-Nutter is all I'm saying).  Did me and my friends have too many (delicious) cocktails and a little too much fun? Probably. But I nonetheless stand by my judgement on this one: plan to have a great time, overeat, and soak in the over-the-top decor, and you will be rewarded.",
