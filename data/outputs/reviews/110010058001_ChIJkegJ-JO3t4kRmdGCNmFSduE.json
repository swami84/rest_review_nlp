We tried making our way back to our hotel but streets had been blocked by the police. All the rerouting confused my Garmin and we were already getting hangry at each other\ud83d\ude04 Luckily a car pulled out of a parking space and I quickly sidled up to the curb. There were a couple of other restaurants along the street, but we decided to go to the emptiest one; with covid rising again and all. So glad we ended up in Haad Thai!\ud83d\udc4d  Hands down, the most authentic Thai food I\u2019ve tasted in a while. I ordered the Tom Yum and it was delightful. It was a perfect balance of sour, sweet, spicy soup, complemented by mushrooms, tomatoes, and shrimp. You can taste it from the aroma alone. A good whiff gives you that citrusy sensation from the lemongrass and galangal. The lime instantly bounces on your tongue at first taste of the soup. It\u2019s like a sigh of relief after a long drive into DC. It was small serving however, next time I\u2019ll ask if they have meal portions.  The Pad Thai is actually street food in Thailand, but it is divine. The merry mix up of ingredients is brought together by the perfect blend of tamarind juice and palm sugar, which make up the base sauce. Each forkful of noodles is chewy goodness in your mouth. This basic dish alone is worth coming back to.  We also had the lunch special which was a pumpkin curry with pork. They can prepare it with your protein of choice. They can also spice it up to your taste. It\u2019s a straight up curry dish, but the cubes of pumpkin adds a yummy level to the dish. I understand that most Americans know pumpkin as a pie ingredient, but Asians have it as vegetable. Think of it as a sweet potato in a savory recipe. Like a great meal, all flavors from the soup, to the noodles, to the last dollop of curry sauce on the rice all melded together for a great, historic day in DC!",

Plenty of steamed vegetables in the plate and sauce was flavorful.  I appreciate having a separate gluten free menu, reduces the guesswork for people like me to have to eat gluten free. Reasonable prices for DC makes this a place I will be back to.",

When I asked how long our food will be ready, the waiter asked us to wait. Then the food was ready in a few minutes. It looked like they forgot our order. The Pad Z-U with beef was very difficult to chew.  My daughter said the beef was like beef jerky. The only good dish was the drunken noodles but it was not spicy at all. It supposed be medium hot.

Was surprised that the restaurant was full at 1 p.m. on a Thursday, a good sign! Atmosphere: Cozy with a pleasant, tropical motif (painted on the walls was a beachy, paradise-like background) and tiny lights hung from the ceiling. Customer service: Everyone was very friendly, polite and served with a smile. Food: I ordered the house salad with the peanut dressing. It was served to me immediately, which typically is a bit off-putting since I'm never sure how long it has been sitting in the cooler; however, the salad was crisp, cool, refreshing and very delicious! Loved the dressing. I ordered the Panang Duck based on the recommendation of my server when I asked her which duck dish was 'the best'. And it was very good. I was a bit disappointed at the portion size when it first arrived, but later realized how filling it was. Served with rice, four pieces of broccoli and a few slices of duck. I wasn't impressed with how fatty the outside ring of the duck was. In the past, the duck I've eaten at Thai restaurants has had a very crisp skin; albeit, this was delicious!  I would certainly recommend and will come back on my next visit.",

Refused to vary the spice saying they will give only mild so \"Americans can eat\" and told us to add what we want on top.  They had pre fried the tofu and just dumped it in watery curry and brought it out in 1-2 minutes after ordering. Even for rice, no choice of white or brown and was cold.

        "caption": "The first time I went here, the service was good and the food was pretty good too.  I asked for no egg because of a yolk allergy. It was decent, generic Thai food. The second time I asked for no egg again, and they served me egg. By the time I realized, it was too late.  I immediately was very sick with an allergic reaction even though I thought I made it clear to them that I could not eat egg yolks.  There was probably a language issue.  Alas, I will not go back and risk another hospital visit.",

The Yum Talay was marked as spicy on the menu and it was awesome. The portions are bigger than average Thai places I've taken out. I did not have the Pad Thai so can't comment on that. I recommend the restaurant.",
