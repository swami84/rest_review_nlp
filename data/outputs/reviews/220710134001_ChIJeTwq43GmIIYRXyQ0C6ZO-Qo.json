Three out of five of the entrees ordered were hamburgers and all three of them came out blackened and burnt. The fourth entree was a extremely dry and disgusting short rib, which only came with two small pieces of meat for an absolutely outrageous price considering the quality of the meat. Our fifth entree was a crawfish and aligator fettuccine, which was just okay tasting but not at all worth the 40$ after added crab meat.  Our server was not very good, she took care of us okay when we were the only table in the restaurant. However 10 minutes after we sat down anotber group came in who apparently knew her personally and from then on out the service took a serious drop. To start the meal she asked if we would like to start with some water, to which we all said yes considering the heat and humidity in New Orleans. What she failed to mention was that the waters she gave us were 5$ per bottle, then continued to bring more bottles to the table and continued to fill our glasses without our consent or desire.  The restaurant could also use with some serious deep cleaning. The tables, plates, and cutlery were clean but the floors were definitely not. Walking on the floors you could feel how sticky and disgusting they were without even looking. There was also an unmistakable odor in the restaurant that we couldn't identify.  All in all this was easily the most disappointing food we have eaten in the week we have been here. Do yourself a favor and get fast food before going to Galliano restaurant.  Terrible food, very overpriced, and unclean restaurant. If I could rate 0 stars I would.",

It was like eating canned green beans with the taste of liquid smoke. That dish I would avoid. Fortunately, the rest of the food and experience made up for it. I would definitely eat their again.",

I had the Cajun Tournedos - 2 bacon wrapped filets with mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed southern greens.  It was delicious.  The others in the party had the seafood platter and the blackened catch of the day.  They both enjoyed theirs. Prices were reasonable.  Service and atmosphere were excellent.

Wow. We were not disappointed. Small place; chill with a few tables and a long bar. Busy for a Monday night, given all of the things going on at the convention center (including our own). Thankfully, we didn't need a reservation to eat at the bar. Cody (hope I'm spelling his name right) made the night even better. He was full of energy and very attentive. I love it when people seem to really enjoy what they do and are especially good at it. Amazing service. We did raw oysters, drinks, meals (I had the seafood platter and he had the pot roast), and dessert (bread pudding). It was comfort food at its finest. Highly recommend it. Larger parties might want to be sure to reserve ahead of time in order to ensure getting a table.",

The chef even came out and said hello and personally cut him and my other son up some apples and was just overwhelmingly kind! The food came out hot, quick and was so delicious!!! The wedge salad had a great twist and the chargrilled oysters were amazing! And the wine list was fantastic. My dad got the beer flight which was great too.

That's nice-depending on how one looks at it I suppose.  Got my bite and white cold wine in!  Bar server gave me a sampler of hush poppies during happy hour and it wasn't served during that time!  Amazing!  I savored every bite!  It put a dazzling smile in my face!  Gumbo was flavorful and complimented thenoust  Liquor tax $5 flat! Lesson learned is to store up on drinks at 1 bar place!  Everything looks delish here on Creole food!",

We started with raw and chargrilled oysters and i got myself a beer flight which you can pick 3 for $12 bucks. Man. I really liked those raw oysters at ACME but I loved Galliano's oysters even more. I'm usually the guy who eats one oyster and call it a day but had to order more because they were that good. Chargrilled oysters had a nice seasoning to it and it wasn't heavy like some other places I went to in NOLA. We also had picked onion rings and those were epic. When is the last time you had onion rings and didn't feel sick afterwards.  So flavorful!!  The staff was fantastic too. Thank you for such a great time.",

The owner (Richard, I think) was fantastic - very engaged with the customers and also cooking another night. Our server (Katy) was brilliant with us on both occasions and her recommendations were spot on.  Tried 3 mains: Cajun Prime Rib for 2, Southern Fried Chicken & Pork Chop la Place. All were amazing! Bring your appetite regardless of what you have, but especially for the prime rib! Appetizers and desserts were also lovely.  I could eat here every night! Make sure to check it out.

My friend and I stumbled upon this gem in our quest to find Cajun food close to the convention center. We reached early enough that there was no wait or need for reservations. We got 2 appetizers and a main to split between us. The duck wings came recommended, while I wanted to try the alligator, so I chose the alligator sauce piquante appetizer. The main entre was a blackened salmon on a bed of veggies. The appetizers trumped everything! So so so good. The sauce for the duck wings was beyond fantastic. I actually dipped salmon in it, while my friend scraped the remains off the plate. The alligator meat was fried, savory, the sauce spicy. The salmon was just as expected- blackened and crisp on the outside and melting soft on the inside.  The complimentary hush puppies were great too! All in all, great experience, cute little restaurant and recommend it to any travellers to NOLA!",

Also, one of the employees was shucking oysters right there at the bar, which I'd never seen in person before. He let me know how he prepares the oyster so it doesn't have any sand in it.  Overall, very satisfied with the service, food, and quality of my dining. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a healthy and tasty meal at a very affordable price.",

I asked our server if we could be moved as there were at least 5 empty tables for 4 available. He immediately goes into \"those are reserved for people who made a reservation.\" Ok. So with that, I went to the hostess. She started to say the same thing when I remind her that we have a reservation and point out the numerous empty tables. She says she will need to speak to her manager and as she does she huffs and rolls her eyes, hard. Oh I'm so sorry to annoy you. The manager, I regret not getting his name, was accommodating and understood why we wanted to move. He is the only reason we stayed after the previous service received. Again, although the portions are huge, it was quite bland. I wouldn't recommend or return when I'm back in New Orleans.",

Very expensive but quality will match it. The bartender and manager serve you like they were your friends. One of them did their own personal open mic night with Joe rogan's jokes. They have two ribeye steaks prepared differently and boy they are good and then dessert pumpkin bread pudding and bourbon peacon pie.  And of course they have alcohol it's New Orleans. With a city with so much food to offer this has to be one if not the best. It is a must to have dinner here New Orleans. I hope they never change I plan to fly my whole family here just to have it.",

Catfish and Pork Chop (pictured) earned high marks, along with the gumbo and chowder. Unlike the other restaraunts recommended, it had the feel of a local hangout.

Until we received our bill, which we split down the middle between two people, that coincidentally had $11 added to each check. The receipt did not state gratuity could be added as LA that is illegal.  Our pleasant waitress had convenienlty stepped out, so another assisted us and did not care to give us an explanation or even suggest what could've happened. Unacceptable. The manager did not come over to apologize, nor have the waitress when she came back in (without making eye contact) explain what may have cause the overcharge. Unacceptable.  We were great customers and happen to tip very well everywhere we go...and STILL Tipped her well because she was a great waitress. We felt discriminated against as we were the only people of color at the time being served. UNACCEPTABLE.  The food is great, but check your bill...especially if you happen to be out of town.  ---REPLY TO OWNER--- Thank you for your reply. I would like to be clear, we DID NOT ask for separate checks, instead Wanda asked us if we wanted the check split and we declined separate checks. We preferred to split the one bill down the middle which all point of sales systems allow as I am an analyst for one.  I appreciate this response, however, it would have been more appreciated had that apology and simple explanation come from Wanda or Charlie (assuming he was the manager that night).  They both avoided eye contact as we sat boxing our food- I even saw Charlie look out the corner of his eye. No apology. No explanation. No \"have a good night\". Unacceptable!  This review is solely based on their cold treatment toward us, that could have simply ended with, \"it was a mistake and we're sorry...\" We would have accepted that because she was simply that sweet of a waitress, but to then completely ignore us while we watched her colleague explain to her what happened and continued to ignore us.  It should have been just as easy to tell us in person as it was to reply here that it was a long day, and a simple miscalculation. If you can't tell, the 180 degree switch in our treatment was blatant and left us believing the overcharge was intentional, otherwise a genuine apology would have been immediate. The food is great but I will be filing with the better business bureau as service and management to treat customers in that way is abusive and should not be directed to others.",

Charbroiled oysters were BOMB - a little pricier than you'll find further from the quarter but worth it (fresh oysters are $1 each at happy hour and charbroiled are 6 for $10 or 12 for $20). Left full and happy.  The place was empty when we arrived at 5:30 but by 6 it was pretty much full. Recommend a 5:30 reservation for the best service.",

I wasn't happy with my chicken but wasn't making a big deal of it. Terry and Doug could tell and were nice enough to remove it and offered to replace it. I wasn't about to make the kitchen cook. I owned a restaurant, so I'm sympathetic, to days like they had. Impeccable service and attentive to customers needs. I thank you for your kindness. Hard to find that these days. Everything else was delicious. We will be back soon. Dying to try that prime rib.",
