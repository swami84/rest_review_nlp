Make sure u call for a reservation or to see if there are tables available. We walked up early so luckily we got a table outside. The restaurant otherwise was full with reservations. The food was amazing. We got raw Octopus wasabi, grilled squid, grilled mackerel, steamed shrimp dumplings, fried oysters, and pan fried noodles with squid legs and bonito flakes. They were all 10/10 would recommend. Thanks for the good meal!",

It's definitely reasonably priced within the crazy price levels of Waikiki. The taste is comparable to Japanese izakaya. There are many opinions that everyone is serving, but there is no sticky customer service. On the way back, I talked to the general of the store and said that I was confused by the increase in the number of customers since being introduced on TV\u2757 It seems that he wants to do business steadily as a store that people who know quietly know. If you are Japanese, please talk to him, because he is a Frank husband. I'm worried about how much corona is affecting. I hope you will do your best to hold it.

We went there after dinner so we didn't order anything heavy and just picked a few appetizers from the menu. The food was good but the atmosphere was better.  There was also another group of Japanese guests in the restaurant at that time and they were very loud while talking among themselves. I have no problem with that and actually enjoyed though I did no understand anything they said but I heard that is what it is like in Japan. I can understand some people might not like the loud environment.  There was also a Cotten candy machine outside and they are given a small amount of sugar after the check to make your own Cotten candy. Give it a try. It isn't as easy as you may think.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) x The first visit. I was always indebted to 'Takano Ki', but this time I searched for it on Google and went to this store. All the dishes are delicious and satisfying.  However, when I wanted to go to the bathroom and came to a female clerk, I was told only \"It's on the second floor\" and I went straight back. (The clerk comes in contact with everyone with no expression on the whole) I could not find the stairs in the shop no matter how much I looked down, but I found that it was like the handrails of the stairs outside the entrance.  When I went upstairs, I entered a bar-like space full of foreigners rather than a toilet. There were 7-8 people, but no one cares. I thought that I made a mistake, but when I was going to go into the back of the room and get in the bathroom, I had a key. 15 minutes to wait for someone to come in first. If you think that something is strange and ask others, you can use the key.  I have made my lower wife and daughter wait for a while.  The first time I went to the store, I was told that the bathroom was only upstairs, I went on the stairs outside, went into the bar only for the unfamiliar foreigners I had not heard, and told me to lend me the key. How do you know if you can not use the toilet without it?  When I returned to the first floor and told the lady clerk to explain enough, I was quite awaited, but this time I was afraid or not coming close to me, and I had to wait for accounting. If you are working in the United States and receiving a chip, you may want to think about service to customers a little more. It is a shame that the food was generally good. It may not be suitable for people in their 40s or later. We have lived in Canada for about 30 years and are familiar with North American culture and dining. Anyway, I think that the toilet is quite inconvenient. Especially because I get close when I drink. . .  Next time, let's go back to 'this tree' again? It's a little expensive. . . I think.

The sake is great and served in large portions.  The grapefruit chu-hi is with fresh juice.  Do not leave without trying the pork belly, the tofu ground pork stir-fry, and saba (whole fish).  The gyoza were perfectly fried on one side and soft on the other two.  The portions are all perfect.  The prices are more than reasonable.
