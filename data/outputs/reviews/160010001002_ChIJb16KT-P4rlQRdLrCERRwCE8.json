Then we sat for 25+ minutes waiting for our waiter to return. The couple that came in some time after us was seated and served before my fiance and I,  who I was on a date with to celebrate our engagement, even saw our waiter. Only time we saw him after ol'Stormy dropped off our drinks was on our way up to the front desk. Not only will I never be returning I will be actively recommending people do not go here.",

They have adorable options for table decorations for the birthday guest, I went with the Teddy bear and balloon. They even let me come in a few hours early to add more of my own gifts to the table.  We went all out and selected to 4-course meal \"Bigger dinner for 2.\" As inclusive as it is, it was an absolute steal for the price. This included an appetizer cheese fondue, two small salads, chicken, sirloin, filet, shrimp, salmon, and the best of all, Lobster tail! Everything was finished off with a chocolate fondue. For drinks we enjoyed a pitcher of their Sunshine Sangria. It is very summery and kind of reminds you of a beach vacation. I think their red sangria would have been another excellent choice, for our next visit.  It was so fun cooking our selections as we progressed through the night. We had a lovely and attentive server Regan, who made our experience that much better. Thank you Melting Pot! Can't wait to be back!",

Me and my bf could hear the Manager appraoching various tables, letting them know as nicely as possible that they needed to finish up cause there was another reservation in place for that table. While we were in the middle of our dinner, we got the same talk, and that we can do dessert at the bar or take a 20$ voucher for a later time. We told the waiter that it would be beneficial to let the customers know when they seat about the 2 hour time limit, cause we didn't know.. to which the waiter said the information was on the website (I called directly and asked about the whole valentines deal directly the other week when I was placing my reservation. She never told us about the time constraint). I then asked about our champagne, since we never got it and it was part of the package, he said it was complimentary and doesn't effect the value of the dinner, so we wouldn't get reprieve from the bill for not getting it. He said \"if you want, I can bring some right now\" so he quickly brought out two glasses as we were getting ready to leave, we slammed the drinks in a hurry, and I paid $235 when all was said and done for this. Needless to say, I won't come back to this place. I get the time crunch, but if you consistently need to push people out than not..then you simply aren't giving people enough time and certainly not their moneys worth. Time management needs recalibrating.",

My daughter was really looking forward to it as she hasn't had it before.  Long story short. Our server was SLOW! Like 30 min in between checking on us slow. Between courses she would just be gone. We had to bust our own table, bring our check to the front to pay. It was unbelievable.  3 hours and an hour of that was just sitting there waiting for water or our server to remember she had our table.  The water boy, sounded like he was high and bored AF.  Food was meh. Tiny peices,  like scraps unlike other fondue restaurants that have nice sized cuts. These were one bite peices. Everything was just meh to about to fall asleep waiting for service.  For the $225 meal price tag I expect at least as good of service I'd get at IHOP.  I will NOT ever darken the doors of the Melting Pot again. If I hear of anyone I know who wants to go there I shall tell them to go to any of the hundreds of other restaurants in Boise.  Thanks for reading and remember... don't fondue,  fondon't!",

My husband surprised me for our anniversary and bought the \u201cAnniversary Package\u201d which was supposed to be a private booth with a dozen red roses and a bottle of wine. When we arrived, the waitstaff couldn\u2019t find our reservations. After waiting 15 minutes for a table, they realized they had placed our reservation under the wrong name. We were taken to our \u201cprivate booth\u201d which was a table shoved in a corner. The roses were wilting and looked like they came from the clearance section of Albertsons. Their wine selection is \u201cred\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d, a total of 2 different types. They took our picture to commemorate the celebration with an digital camera from 2000. Our appetizers took almost an hour to arrive, as the entire staff was busy chatting in the kitchen. Once the food finally arrived, there was cross contamination because there was only one fondue bowl to cook everything. We spent over $250 on bland food, cringeworthy wine, a blurry picture, and the dining ambiance of a rundown Chili\u2019s. Don\u2019t waste your time or money and ruin a celebration",

After FINALLY getting the first course  we had to wait 10 minutes for our forks and napkins only to discover the cheese was cold.  Drinks were hardly delivered and not filled until we had to ask.  At one point we contacted the manager because it was horrible.  For the next 2.5 hours - he didn\u2019t come back to check on us once. We have been avid customers for many many years but this experience has left us cold .... just like the fondue we were served.  No longer making at the table - bad decision. Fondue is not good.",

Cheese, salad and chocolate get prepared for you but the entree\u2019s are cooked by you with the method of your choice which takes some time.

We showed up and were seated within 5 minutes and the staff was super friendly! Our server/bartender turned out to be one of the owners and she was super nice as well as her husband. They also own a Melting Pot in Spokane,Washington which any time we stop through there we'll keep in mind to visit. They answered any questions we had and were just nice all around. There was another team member who I can't remember his name but he recommended a couple of chill spots to have a beer in the area which was also helpful. Next time we come to visit we will be making it a point to return here. Food was excellent and tasted fresh! Good size portion for the price as well. The Melting Pot mule is a must!",

They even give you dipping sauces for the meat, which is a clear sign that it's a low cut of meat. It was an experience that I'm glad I don't have to repeat.",

We were not greeted by or sever for about 10 minutes after being seated, she then came by and took our drink order, it took about 15-20 minutes to get our drinks. Once we ordered and they brought the cheese out the server has to make each at the table, the first cheese took forever, then the second pot of cheese wasn't melting, we checked the burner and it wasn't on. She said it was unplugged, which is below the table on the wall by the floor, she had us, the guests, go below the table and plug it back in. The cheese chose took over 30 minutes before we could even eat it due to the slow cooking and slow server,i even offered top help stir the cheese pits for her as she was so slow ans we were tired of having the server stand at or table making small talk. We ordered another drink, the salads came, our drinks were still empty. Finally i found another server and asked for our drinks, the manager came over and apologized for the wait, said she is assigning  us a new server and that this round of drinks would be on them. We appreciated this. The new server was very nice and seemed much better than the first. We had now been there 2.5 hours when he brought out the pots for dinner. The food was great once we got it. It then seemed like we never saw our waiter again. He took our dessert order but by this time we had been there 3 hours and we had to get home to relieve the baby sitter. I asked to speak to the manager as we never saw the server again, he apologized for the wait and i said we just want to close out and get the dessert to go. He got us the dessert tip go and gave us $20 gift cards for our next time in. We will never be back after that. We arrived at 7:15pm and left at 1030pm.",

The food is amazing and the idea and potential are fabulous  but to be told the cheese we ordered they didnt have all the ingredients for was a little out of the ordinary.  The bar is no longer a full bar, the tables look like hell and we had to move tables because the heat element kept turning off and the portions were half the size....as is the menu now. When I went to the bathroom, things were broken, walls looked bad and it was dirty. This place use to be the best place but today, it is run down, employees arnt friendly, it needs a facelift and they need to bring the bar back. If I'm going to pay $250 for dinner, I want it to be worth it! I pray a yr. from now that this place is still there but the direction it's going and has been for the last 5 yrs is not good. If you want to make money....make it worth peoples while to go. So disappointed!!!!",

We do not look \"trashy\" and I easily make twice what this meal costs in a single day.  Her snobbishness is what gained her a $17 tip on a $150 bill.

He knew exactly the right amount of time to be at the table, always had a smile, put a lot of hard work into making our experience good, never rushed us and overall I would just say provided five star service! We have ate at a lot of top restaurants all over the US and Dallen out-served many of those! It was refreshing and we hope that he sticks to it because he\u2019s very good at it! The food was also very good so all in all I have to say we were incredibly impressed with what a great meal we had.",

When we were here last weekend, we were able to try FRESH, WARM pretzel bread. We had no idea they made their own bread, but our waitress informed us they do and let us try some fresh bread when we asked for some more with our cheese. We always do the 4 course meal and ask for two portions of cheese, share our salad, share our meat, and share our dessert. It's the best way to do it because you save money and you probably won't be able to eat two portions of everything otherwise (we tried once and didn't even touch half of our meat).",

First you get a salad which is pretty straight forward, then you get cheese fondue with plenty of things to dip in cheese is made in front of you and tastes delicious! Then you get to cook your meat in multiple ways from grills to wine which is very fun, finally they serve you one of, if not the best desserts I have ever had which is a chocolate fondue with treats like rice crispies and pound cake. Great place to go for special occasions, the food is delicious as well as the dessert. However I would not recommend coming here often because it is expensive (as you would expect from a restaurant of such grandeur) and could make it feel less special. Would definitely recommend for future events!",

They no longer serve martinis or hard alcohol.  The menu has changed and not for the better. We had the 4 course meal. However you pay 50$!! Each but you only get two servings of main meat. The rest of it you get about 2 or 3 bites each. They used to give you tons of food and have great service. We never got refills and took almost 3 hours to eat. I mean come on!! Also my clothes stunk when I left like fried food. For a hundred dollar dinner on our anniversary,  we could not be more dissatisfied.  I will never be back and I will never recommend this restaurant.  A couple years ago it was great, now your better off saving your money and time",

The menu changed and the \"Boise night out\" is now \"best of Boise\" where you don't get to choose your cheese fondue or your dessert. Such a shame. For the price that you pay, I think being able to select your own cheese and dessert isn't unfair and shouldn't be taken away from the customer. Sad day.  Edit: so apparently you can choose your cheese and dessert which makes me happy, but that was not evident on their menu that I saw. I am glad to know that now though.",

We go once or twice a year, and whenever there is a special reason (school graduation, wedding anniversary, merit raise at work or promotion, etc.). In the 25+ times I've gone here, it's never been a disappointment. Highly recommend the 'Big Night Out' aka 4-course meal. It features salad, cheese fondue, main course, and dessert, each very delicious. The salad is the only course prepared in the kitchen, the rest you cook at the table in a fondue pot. There are various drinks as well, and I love the selection of wine. With this being located downtown, you can walk off everything you eat, really awesome as a summer evening stroll. They will also send you coupons via email which often times discount the food. Expect to spend quite a bit more than most places, but it's seriously worth it.",

This gave us time to really enjoy our food and conversation, and time to let our stomachs settle between courses. Our favorite dish was dessert, especially the strawberries in the chocolet toffee fondue. Overall we we're pleased with the service and ambiance despite our booth (a corner booth for two) being a little small. We will definitely go again!",

The waiter took over 20 minutes to seat us when there was nobody in the building, and then dumped a whole tray of beers on my husband who is an on call nurse. My husband found a hair in his salad, and the cheese dip that we wanted wasn't even available. This is a very expensive meal for such poor service. We left a message for the manager, however, we never even heard back. I don't think we'll be back again.",
