        "caption": "PSA: LEGIT KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN (authentic) (finally got the time to write this 4 year overdue review)  Honestly... This place reminds me so much of Seoul, South Korea. Not so much the experience and atmosphere but definitely the CHICKEN!  Locations: This is one of two locations (used to be three, but they closed down in kalihi). The owners \"Park Family\" here are awesome they are always so friendly and always smiling.  POWER TIP: -Order your chicken ahead of time so that all you have to do is pick up. All of the chicken are made to order so expect fresh crispy and juicy chicken when you take that first bite. -ITS STILL BYOB (2018) so definitly make it a Chimaek night! (chicken and beer).  Price: The prices are reasonable and well worth it, I cant complain about the the cost because its well worth it! Trust Me!  -Half Order: 10 pieces (Prices Vary) -Full Order: 20 pieces (Prices Vary) -Mandoo: 10 pieces ($3.99) (Small sized ones) -Spicy rice cake: ($3.99) -They used to include pickled diakon with every chicken order back in the day but they don't do that anymore..  Flavors to order: Crispy Fried Seasoned (SPICY) -Definitely get the spicy version of the seasoned, its not that spicy (for my taste) but it does add that nice touch and kick to the fried chicken  Crispy Real Garlic Chicken -When ordered normally the shoyu flavor is not that strong, it taste just like the regular fried chicken. When ordering ask extra garlic sauce/flavoring on the chicken, so much better!  Roast Oven Roast/Seasoned Chicken (SPICY or Regular) - I always order the regular plain version of this when I want to eat chicken after a tough work out session, oven roast chicken is so juicy and flavorful! The seasoned spicy one is also great! My favor when I don't want to get the fried version but still want that spicy and sodium :P  Crispy Honey Butter Chicken -So bad but yet so good, if your really want to be a bad boy/girl order this. The Butter and the Honey oh.. you know why its bad.. Sometimes they don't add much of the mixture so be sure to ask them extra extra honey butter sauce on the chicken. oh the guilt.. LOL  Spicy Rice Cake -When you order this you might be disappointed but don't let looks fool you, it goes well with the chicken as a side/alternative to ordering rice. Don't get confused this isn't your usual spicy rice cake you might think of. The rice cake is fried and a spicy sauce is drizzled all over it! So good.  Flavors that were meh..  Snow Wing -The snow wing is powder based and it is topped on the fried chicken and mixed.  Crispy Fried Shoyu Chicken -Just go with the garlic one.  Overall, great place, great food, reasonable prices and really well under-appreciated. The feel may not feel like how it is in Seoul but hey I'm glad my taste buds can at least take a trip there with every bite.",

When I do eat chicken, Von\u2019s is one of the places I go to.  They\u2019re located on Pensacola with only metered street parking in front. We got lucky and a stall was open in front the last time we went. It\u2019s hit or miss depending when you go. This place can get pretty busy and with the parking situation, you may want to call order in ahead. The chicken can take 10-15 minutes and that\u2019s when they\u2019re not busy. The owner was really nice when I asked him about the different chicken.  They have half and full orders of chicken (they\u2019re all mixed pieces of wings and drummettes).  They have about 8 different flavors that are either oven roasted to crispy.  Half order - 10 pieces $11.99-$13.49 Full order -20 pieces $21.88-$23.49  You can also order a plate which comes with 4 pieces of chicken, rice, man doo and Mac salad. I would say stick to the half or full orders. You\u2019re here for the chicken, remember? Forget the sides!  So what\u2019s so great about it? The chicken is super crispy and has flavor too. I don\u2019t like crispy chicken where all you taste is flour batter. The inside was also super moist. Crispy is my favorite! I haven\u2019t tried the other wetter versions (remember, I have chicken issues).  We got the the crispy shoyu for a party, which is their best seller. This was a great flavor and there wasn\u2019t a ton of sauce to make the chicken soggy. We left the box open in the bag to ensure the crispness. I was impressed, about a half hour later, the chicken was still crispy despite the time passed and having a light shoyu sauce on it. Of course, the box was almost empty too. Everyone loved it!  Stop by for a snack or when you need something for a party!",
