We have flan in many countries and places, I would say this is in my top 10%. It's smooth, creamy and not sweet like candy, the light sweetness builds gradually and with depths light flavor. Perfecto!  Glad we found this little gem, can't wait to eat at the restaurant.",

The staff is very knowledgeable about not just the dishes served but the history and location they originat from.  Omg th Empanadas here are some of the best.  And you get 3 giant ones per order.   The croquettes were also very nice and had a good cheezy flavor to them.  A must try also.  Hands down some amazing authentic Latin food dine right.    Spiced down a bit but fabulous none the less.  Give this place a try you will love it!!",

I had the chuleton, the chuletas where fried to perfection yet no seasoning. The mofongo de yuca was amazing! My friends seem to love their mofongo Del Mar and jibaritos.  I couldn\u2019t try it because I\u2019m allergic. The place was super clean and looked great! The parcha juice was unbelievably good tasted like I was back in Puerto Rico. The rice was very good yet old! I\u2019m Puerto Rican and Cocinero myself and you can\u2019t tell me that rice was fresh. Still tasted good but still old. Overall I would definitely come back if we get that friendly service everyone speaks off and they season the chuletas lol.",

My favorite was the coconut flan! I am still dreaming about it. It was about $6 for each flan, pretty expensive but it is quality flan for sure!  There was only one server and the service was a bit slow. But maybe it was a slower night! I would definitely come back for their flan and is looking forward to try other new flavors. Delicious!",

But that picture doesn't tell the whole story, especially not in the kitchen of Casa Yari. In the preparation of the ingredients used for each dish, she brings the flavor forward without distraction. She obtains clarity in taste and presentation so that the guest can fully realize the essence of the vegan products used.  Her intention becomes exceptionally clear in the creation of delicious meat-free dishes, which are available on the menu vegetarian (or vegan).  Casa Yari's vegan dishes aren't bland; on the contrary, they're colorful, exciting and complex.  Yari Vargas chef at Casa Yari definitely knows how to incorporate jackfruit and seitan into her Puerto Rican cooking.",

We ordered the paladar, croquetas de yuca and nidos de camarons to start. Since we shared it with a large group, I was only able to get a small bite of each, but everything was well presented and explained by Hector, our waiter.  He was wonderful, and everything we ordered was amazing, flavorful, well made and delicious.  For the main I ordered Trifongo - fabulous, well presented - I savored every bite.  Finally!

I had the Caribbean nachos, chicken and tropical salsa on fried plantains, (not regular nachos..) my friend had the pastelon,  because she loves it and she said not many places make it, she complimented the chef, she said she had not had beans with that flavor since her mother used to make them. We finished with the Bread pudding with coconut ice cream. The food is made fresh, therefore takes the correct amount of time to cook but not overlong, to keep us busy they brought some complimentary home made chips with caribbean sauce to the table and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. The chef/owner is highly trained and talented, everything was delicious, and served  as if it were a 5 star restaurant. We finished with the Bread pudding, putting that order in at the same time as the nachos because it takes 15 mins to cook. Again, delicious. Pricing was very reasonable for the quality of service and food. Having worked in restaurants, and cooking everything fresh, I don't know how well they handle an absolute rush, but this is a BYOB restaurant, so plan ahead and take advantage of this place in the afternoons, when the service, music, ambiance lets you really enjoy your meal and company.",

        "caption": "... Plus another 5 stars for this place. I cant say enough about the food, service and atmosphere. I've been here twice and it just keeps getting better. I've had the nachos, 4 different flans and the mofongo was a little taste of home. I cannot wait to go back and indulge once more. The waiter is always uber friendly, makes you feel relaxed and welcome. Knows the menu and is always ready to help out with suggestions. All the while Yari is in the background cookin up a storm. Last time I was here it did get a little busy and backed up, but just as soon as you can say platano maduro two ladies came in and went straight to the back. No sooner than that did the food start flyin to the tables. Gotta love the call for kitchen reinforcements. All I can say is I highly endorse the amazing Casa Yari.",
