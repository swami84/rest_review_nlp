        "caption": "[FOOD] L-O-V-E the PANCIT here!! It's nice and light but still packed full of flavor which has gone really well with everything we have tried so far. The LUMPIA is really good. I really liked that it came out to us hot compared to some places where it sits under a heat lamp for a while, it had a nice crunch to it when you bite into it plus it isn't  oily at all which is definitely a good thing. Btw the lumpia is made to order so just a heads up. The SHOYU CHICKEN is nice and tender while still moist, just an fyi here it is more on the sweeter side compared to savory which isn't a bad thing just different. Oh and another thing that I really like is that they sell SODA here for $1!!  [SET UP] There are several tables and chairs for people to sit and eat.  [FYI] The lechon kawali is currently only available on Saturdays though they are working on expanding so that they have more room to cook so when that happens they will be able to expand their menu.",
