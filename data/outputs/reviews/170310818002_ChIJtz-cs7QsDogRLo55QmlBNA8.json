The dishes that can't go wrong are stable, such as pasta. There will be no thundering here, but it won't shine. Some dishes are made a little careless, for example, snails do not have the proper flavor, garlic bread is too salty, and Cheese cake is very general. The service attitude varies, some people are polite and some are even a bit rude. All in all, it is a good restaurant, but after all, Chicago has so many excellent Italian meals, why not change one?

Even though we live right next door, we usually dine in for atmosphere.  Obviously, that is not possible right now, and despite not being known as a \u201ctake out\u201d restaurant by any means, Prosecco delivered my wife and I an incredible meal!  We ordered everything we usually ordered the grilled octopus, avocado lobster salad, seafood pasta, and veal.  It was all just as delicious as it was dine in .  We were both really impressed and appreciative.  We will be ordering again soon!",

What I mean by \"inadvertently\" is she made comments in regards to the cost of service (minimum $75 per guest + 23% gratuity) not ONCE, not TWICE, but THREE times. It made things very uncomfortable in front of my date. It's as if she didn't believe I could afford a meal from such an establishment. My date was irritated, however we kept our cool and didn't react.  Next, I ordered the same dish (Seafood Pasta) for both me and my date. Unbeknownst to me, Veronica put in an order for just ONE dish. The cook (gentleman dressed in an apron) came to the table and advised us to SHARE the dish and wait for the remaining dish. Mindblowing....I know. Remind you, I'M ON A DATE.  After we finished our delicious meal, we placed 2 more orders for carry out. The wait time for 2 chicken dishes was 1 hour total. No exaggeration....ONE HOUR FOR CHICKEN. It's as if the kitchen staff was overwhelmed by a typical holiday crowd.  While leaving I complained to The Manager - Jennifer. She was professional however didn't offer much of a response. I don't usually write reviews. I just couldn't believe how horrific of an experience this was considering it was Valentine's Day. Yes the food was good, however the service was unbearable. I wouldn't recommend restaurant.",

I had had low expectations because it wasn't an Italian restaurant that I had heard much about in Chicago but the food and service totally turned that upside down.  Upon arrival, we were each given a Prosecco toast as we browsed the menu. We got Salsiccia (grilled Italian sausage), Tartufate (orecchiette, cremini, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, black truffle cream, Grana Padano, white truffle oil), and a farfalle pasta special that had smoked and fresh salmon. Everything was scrumptious. The sausage had good flavor and wasn't too salty, and the pastas were cooked perfectly al dente. We were surprised by how filling the portions were, both the antipasti and pastas. There was a ton of salmon in the farfalle special, and the Tartufate really hit the truffle-flavor craving I had without being too greasy or creamy.  The d\u00e9cor, lighting, and ambiance lent itself to a luxurious-feeling space, and our waiter was so nice and attentive the entire time. The restaurant was pretty busy but not loud. I'd totally come back for a special event or celebration next time! The only thing that bumped it down a star was that the complimentary bread was quite stale and dry, and the price of the antipasti was more expensive on our bill ($16) than it was on the menu ($13). Price is not the issue here, it was just somewhat of a surprise.",

Problem was they were SCORCHING hot like they cooked them at 800 degrees just to get them out quick. My date ordered the salmon medium and it came out damn near rare. I will say, the lamb was cooked to perfection and delicious but the rest of the experience over shadowed that. There are hundreds of great places to eat in Chicago.

My wife ordered the whitefish and I had a chicken dish that was on the fixed lunch menu. I must say... these chefs know how to do Italian cuisine. The food was delicious! The inside of the restaurant was warm and inviting. The service was excellent. Due to it being Restaurant Week 2019 our total bill without booze or tip was about $60.00. Their regular prices are a bit higher  for lunch and dinner, but it is well worth it. There is street parking available, but they don't have a parking lot. I would highly recommend this restaurant for celebrating a special occasion or just dining with good friends and family. Enjoy!",

Their bar is absolutely gorgeous with bottles perfectly spaced out, which sounds like not that big of a deal, but it's the small details and efforts that sets this place apart from any other. They go out of their way to ensure your experience is perfect whether it's a special occasion or a causal date night.",

I received a call to verify my reservation and I was asked if there was a special celebration happening. I could tell they were going to offer exceptional service just from how helpful they were over the phone. When we arrived, we took advantage of the $15 valet service which is very convenient. We were 30 minutes early, and were not expecting to be seated right away. To our surprise, they greeted us very happily and sat us right away. I was mind blown when they sat us in their private room. It was an exact set up for six. That made us feel very special and made for an even more special dinner. Our server was very knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. We don't really know our wines, and she made a great suggestion for a semi sweet red that went great with our dinner. We live two hours away, and were nervous as to how the experience was going to go. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a nice special evening with that special someone or just among friends.",

The food was so GOOOD, everyone loved their meals/appetizers!  The wait staff was awesome (we loved Bobbie) & the owner (chef) was very friendly.

        "caption": "My husband decided to take me for a dinner. We came to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, and unfortunately it was the worst dinner ever!!! Let\u2019s start from the beginning, we came on time and everything was ok, we got a table and decided to order drinks, I ordered wine and my husband ordered beer. Our server didn\u2019t know how to pour beer correctly so it was all over the table. Then we ordered an appetizers, I let me server know that I\u2019m pescetarian and I don\u2019t eat meat. I asked him if the clams appetizer has any meat, he said \u201cno\u201d, so I ordered it. After we got our appetizers and I started eating it, I realized that something there looks like pieces of sausages, I asked my server again if it\u2019s meat, he said: \u201cabsolutely not! It\u2019s clams or fish\u201d I was like okay, thanks. And I gave it to try to my husband, he said that it is meat!!!! So I told my server once again, he said: \u201cok, I\u2019m sorry about that, it\u2019s gonna be on a house\u201d. Are you guys serious? First of all, what if had an allergy? I could die because your server doesn\u2019t know what ingredients are in every dish!? Secondly, not eating meat, is my lifestyle, my choice and it\u2019s very important to me! First time in 3 years since I became pescetarian, Prosecco restaurant (\u201chigh level restaurant \u201c) forced me to eat that meat! Your apologies are nothing. I was about to start crying. It was a couple seated near us, and they got there pasta with pieces of chicken, but on the menu it was only salmon. They were vegetarian too, so they  weren\u2019t  happy as well. But anyway we ordered 2 pastas, one vegetarian for me, another one with shrimps for my husband. Another server (turned out that she was a co-owner  of the restaurant) brought us 2 pastas, and one was  with meat, instead of the one with ordered with shrimps!!!!! So we explained it to her again, she said that she is sorry and she touched me by the shoulder at least 5 times like I\u2019m her friend or something. Lady, don\u2019t touch people in any way! I\u2019m not your friend and I don\u2019t like it! That\u2019s my intimate personal space! Do you know what\u2019s that!?! So in the end, she brought us one more pasta with shrimps and told us that the third pasta is on a house... The rule of the Valentine\u2019s Day was 75$ minimum charge per person, which is a lot!! You can\u2019t spend 75$, seriously for real it\u2019s a lot to spend, their prices are not so high, you could die of the food coma! And especially if you are not drinking, so that stupid. You guys are saying that you are high level restaurant, and you are asking for minimum charge? Lol. If your costumers will like what you do they will spend even more.... hold on, it\u2019s not the end of the story. We got our check, and they took my clams appetizer out of the bill, but in the end of the check they added it again!!!! Can you imagine??? I was sooooo mad, so I was asking our server to come to our table again, I was like what\u2019s wrong with you guys??? And it was 22% tip included!! Do you really think that\u2019s normal!?!? 22% tips are for really high level of service, your service worth 0%, in any fast food they serve you better then at your \u201crestaurant \u201c. And then..... their fancy chief (second co-owner) came to our table and started screaming on us, tore a check from my hand and started his loud show: \u201cI\u2019m so tired of you, relax, everything is on a house! We are very busy today. And  you ruined everyone\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day and bla bla bla\u201d.  excuse me sir, don\u2019t you think you ruined our dinner????? And do you really think that I care if you are busy or not? It\u2019s none of my business! It\u2019s so unprofessional to explain why you messed up, I don\u2019t want to hear your excuses, because I DO NOT CARE!!!!! I came to relax, to pay 150$ plus tax and plus 22% tips and not to solve your problems! In the end their manager came to our table, and he was the only one polite and professional there. I will never come again, I will post my review on every social media! I DONT recommend this restaurant to anyone! Please be aware!!!",

They also, don't have valet which I found odd for a high end restaurant.",

You will have a hard time finding a better dining experience. Every time I go to Prosecco it seems like it gets better and better. I don't normally write reviews but this seemed worthy.",

It was a very traumatic experience, but everyone remained calm and caring until the paramedics arrived and got him to the hospital.  I can't say enough about how incredible the staff was, and I'm beyond thankful for their assistance as they had a lot to do with my dad's ability to recover that night. Thank you for the fantastic service, food and kindness. We look forward to seeing everyone again soon!",

        "caption": "We visited here last evening, enjoying a wonderful meal and a bottle of wine from their extensive wine list.  To start off, we tried the Polpetti e Calamari Alla Grigliati which was a combination of octopus, calamari and fingerling potatoes.   What a delight!  For a main course we shared the Costoletta di Agnello (Rack of Lamb), finding it to just melt off the bone.  Wrapping up, we enjoyed the Torta di Cioccolato (flourless chocolate cake) and Torta di Mele (Apple Tart).  Needless to say, we left fully satisfied from a terrific meal.  The service was prompt and the decor just perfect, providing a nice casual elegance for a comfortable dining experience.  It's a terrific place for a nice meal!",
