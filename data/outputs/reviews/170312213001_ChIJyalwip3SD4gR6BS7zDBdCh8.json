The guy taking orders had a scowl on his face the entire time he was making my sandwich and barely said a word. Don't know what his problem was. The place was empty yet for some reason there were bits and pieces of food on the floor.  Food quality wise, the items here still don't taste as fresh as any other Subway I've visited. Even the bread on my Italian BMT, the 9 grain honey oat, was meh. They even made my favorite Italian BMT recipe taste meh as well. It's amazing how over the years this place has failed to improve.  Overall, I doubt I'll be back again even if I do get a craving. The prices are pretty steep as well, with me paying about $8 per footlong.",
