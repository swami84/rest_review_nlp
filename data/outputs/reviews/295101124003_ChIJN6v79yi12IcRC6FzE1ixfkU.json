So I only tried one thing so far (after careful consideration) I got the cheese sauce and beef with fried onions and horsy sauce. It's something my Dad would of made. Feel good comfort food. But with homemade high quality ingredients (no offense to my dad's love affair with velveeta though). I forgot how to spell it but the bread is from La Bom Voucher (best bakery for decades).  It's less than $10 too. Which is a fair price for this quality coming from this location (it's an expensive area to operate in).  The owners name is Stephan. He looks young but had worked in restaurants for 15 years. This is the first one he has owned himself. And he is there working, doing everything, not hiding behind the scenes trying to take it easy. This guy hustles (and is polite while he does it).  But come for the food. I bet you be back a second and third and... You know..",
