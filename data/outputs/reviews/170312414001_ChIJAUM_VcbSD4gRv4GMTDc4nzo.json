We had the impossible burger and Umami Burger, as well as fries with a side of truffle ketchup. Everything was much better this time, so I'm updating my rating to 5 stars. I appreciate that the business responded to my original review and wanted to make my experience better!  Original review: We came in for dinner last night and ordered onion rings, an umami burger and a throwback burger. The umami was good for the first 2 bites but the good rich taste tapered off for the remaining chomps. A little disappointing, definitely not the best burger in Chicago. The onion rings were incredibly undercooked, all of them had a raw batter inside. My date got a real bad stomach ache after the meal. The service was great, though. So it's got that going for it. Our sever swapped out fries for the onion rings which was nice. The side sauces were also very good.",

I've never had a bad meal here and you truly cannot go wrong, provided you like burgers.  The fries are crispy and delicious and you can order any of several of their wonderful dipping sauces.  My favorites are Diablo, Honey Mustard, Miso mustard, and Buffalo.  Drinks are solid and service is usually outstanding.  Lunch for two with tip kept us right around $40 bucks, which for Wicker Park, is pretty reasonable.  Go, eat, enjoy.  Trust me.  It's great.",

You want any sauces? That's extra now. My favorite burger (the Manly) now uses cheap bacon instead of lardons. I now don't have a reason to come here because there really isn't anything that distinguishes this restaurant. The burgers are plain and cheap at this point. This review is two stars instead of one because they have perfected the Impossible burger. The rest of the menu is either lackluster or overpriced.",

Visited again on 09/21/19 and was the same disappointing experience. Nothing special Umami burger for $13.50 except an oversized bun to make it look better. 1 (one!) piece of mushroom and 1 piece of tomato about 1 inch in diameter.

We are talking a $14 burger and this burger looks so sad on the empty plate. It' was such an itty bitty burger and it didn't even come with fries. As far as the taste goes, it was fine. A decent burger for sure, but I left hungry which never makes for a good experience.

We were far too hungry and tired to wait for another.  Still very tasty! Just not as done as we would have liked. We informed or wait staff. While the manager never came to talk with us, they did remove the burgers from our tab. I'd go again, for sure, I'd just make sure to check my mail before eating it, if time allows.

I expected an amazing experience, but the food and service was lackluster. My burger was good, but it was a little too charred on the bottom (mind you, I ordered the Everything but the bun burger - salad) and the butter lettuce was a little bitter. It took 45 minutes to get our burger and it was not even that busy. Our waiter passed our table several times and did not once refill my water and I could not even ask him since he would rush past. The only upside were the thin fries. They were delicious as was the ketchup and barbecue sauce (both with a Japanese twist). If you are a foodie like me, I want good food and good service. This place needs some brushing up on customer service. It is worth a try, but not a must try place.",

The server, Michelangelo, appeared to be the only server on a Tuesday night (with one bartender/one hostess) and as a result the service was very, very slow.

The burgers aren\u2019t overly complex but the flavor profiles are unique and unforgettable.  The cheesy tots are also pretty amazing. I never thought I would be blown away by tots but they managed it.  The beer selection wasn\u2019t great and was dominated by the really hoppy side of the spectrum. The saving grace was some Old Rasputin (sadly from the bottle) which pairs really well with burgers.  The service was TOP NOTCH. Our server (John I believe) was really nice, very knowledgeable about the menu and funny (in the chill way, not the overly friendly annoying way)  Will absolute be back, A+++",

The food is still excellent, but the service has completely hit a wall in the past 2 months.  The most recent 3 times I've been over the past 2 months (we go relatively frequently), the service has just been so slow. Recognizing the trend, I made sure to note the times on my most recent visit. We arrived at 7:15 pm and were seated right away. We placed our order around 7:35 and didn't receive our burgers and fries until just after 8:30 pm. The restaurant was a little busy right when we arrived, but was no means packed. I can't imagine why it took an hour to receive our burgers.  The selection has also changed quite a bit. We used to love the 4 sauces that came with the fries, but now there are only 2. It seems like they're discontinuing the free sauces to encourage people to buy the specialty fries ($7). The size of a full order of fries has also decreased. We used to be able to order 2 full order of fries to split among 4 people, but now everyone pretty much needs their own order. I think this is because they've switched from a full ceramic bowl to a basket with a paper lining. It looks like you're receiving the same amount of fries, but as soon as you get through the top layer, there's not much left. $4.50 for a basket of fries should be plenty for the entire table, but it isn't.",

My burger was cooked well done, when I ordered it medium rare. We asked for two sides of ranch and were given one white mystery sauce after asking the food runner, since the server forgot to include them in the order. My friends burger was too spicy for him to eat after the server assured him it wouldn\u2019t be.  The worst part was the service. The server only came to the table for our order, and to drop off the check. So we were forced to eat food that clearly wasn\u2019t what we ordered.  Not to mention the food is over priced. Would be okay if we didn\u2019t have the situation described above.",

I had the Manly burger - it was cooked to perfection and the various flavors combined with the soft bun to make it a delicious burger you won't want to miss. We decided to be a bit adventurous and tried the Maple Bacon French Fries. Great decision! The fries were crispy despite the coating of maple and we could not stop eating them. I would say the burger was a bit smaller than expected but that will not stop me from visiting again. Looks like the place gets pretty busy so you might want to reserve a table ahead of time. We would have had to wait about an hour for a table but were offered the option to eat at the bar where we were quickly served. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back and try the other burgers. Edit to add: Been back 2 more times and have had great experiences. Burgers and sides are delicious and service continues to be friendly and quick.",

The brioche bun is very tender, so with the melty cheese and tender patty the whole burger is floppy in this enjoyably crushable way. Those prices though... About 50% overpriced for what you get. The burgers run from $13 to $16 (to best of my memory) without add-ons or fries. It would be one thing if the portions were big, but the sides and burgers are nowhere near generous. The beer selection leaves much to be desired. Ambiance feels like a burger theme park. I've been to Umami a few times in the past 10 or so years and every time I feel confident that I don't need to go back.",

Their homemade ketchup & pickles are worth trying even if you're not super crazy about those things generally. I ordered the k-bbq burger that comes with kimchee and it was delightful! Tried my friends sweet potato fries and man those things were good. The only thing I was not crazy about was my drink, the garden party, it was a lavender citrus concoction that I thought would be really good. The presentation was spot on, little sprigs of lavender and slices of grapefruit, lime, and lemon. Upon first sip it was quite clean tasting, but finishing the whole thing just made me think of drinking a cleaning product. My insides definitely felt cleansed after that. It might just not have been my drink, it was quite an interesting one though definitely try if you're into extremely herby-citrus drinks",

While the burger patties themselves were good, we were extremely disappointed when our burgers were delivered in lettuce rather than a bun. We didn't see any note on the menu that the vegan version wouldn't have a bun. Our server, while very sweet, also did not mention that the vegan version was bunless. We were also disappointed that there was no sauce. To me, Umami Burger must know that so many of the people buying the Impossible Burger are vegans. I don't understand why they don't offer a real burger, bun and all, for the vegan version. It's so easy to find vegan bread (we get it in the bakery section at the grocery store, nothing special) and to make a vegan sauce. I would love to come back and have that delish burger, but it just doesn't feel like a burger without the bun.",
