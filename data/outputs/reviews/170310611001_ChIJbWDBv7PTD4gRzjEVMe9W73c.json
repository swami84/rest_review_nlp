Once the deal was pulled out from under my feet, I felt like I was ripped off, as I had to now pay full price to a now sold out show. Before making the purchase for the second time, Chris and I discussed on the phone the view and everything that was included with the cost of the ticket. He told me that we would have no obstructions and would have clear view of the stage! After last night, I have to say that I would be looking for my money back and a full refund! We sure did have a clear view of the stage, the side of the stage and none of the Act! After discussing with other extremely upset patrons, especially the ones from out of town, I don't know how someone can feel comfortable charging as much as they did without seeing a show! I have to say, I feel like I was lied to from the beginning, and their sales pitch for the event was a clear play on words! The venue would be an excellent choice for a baseball game, but one of the worst choices if you actually wanted to see a show / concerts! The food was good but average and the lack of top shelf drinks did not bring either to the ticket price we paid, especially since there was no view, and drinks did not start until 2 hours after entry (another thing not brought up or clear)! I would be interested in hearing a response as to how they feel comfortable charging the amount they did for what was given to the event goers? Yes, it was an \"experience\", but not a good Wrigley experience! It was a costly one, with many unhappy and complaining they were duped by your rooftop representatives, thinking we were going to actually SEE the show.",

It was my bachelorette party and after the purchase I was so nervous, What if we can't see a thing, what if the food sucks, what if the drinks are awful and cheap and watered down?  I LOVE THIS ROOFTOP!  The view - amazing, The Food - amazing, the Staff - amazing.  The food was burgers, hot dogs, sausages, chicken sandwich and veggie burgers, along with potato salad, fruit salad, veggies and pasta salad.  They also had bags of chips and later came out with cookies, brownies and ice cream.  The wine selection was good, not super high end but decent and drinkable wines.  I loved that there were lots of options, stadium seating on the top floor, and bar type seating on the second floor. Also, plenty of bathrooms and everything was super clean.  Really though, the staff tipped the 5 star amazing scale.  They were SUPER friendly and fun - I even joked they were so nice they must be from Wisconsin.  This place made my night!",
