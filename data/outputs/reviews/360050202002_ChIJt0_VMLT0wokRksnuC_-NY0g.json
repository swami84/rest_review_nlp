The inside of this Pizza shop feels like its from the late 70s early 80s on account of it's wood paneling and it's don't do dope stickers.  This restaurant also features NY Yankees Championship signs, and interesting news articles.  My biggest criticism of this restaurant is that it doesn't have any specialty pizzas.  No Buffalo Chicken Pizza, no BBQ Chicken Pizza, and no Ranch-Bacon Pizza.  Otherwise pretty good Pizza joint.",
