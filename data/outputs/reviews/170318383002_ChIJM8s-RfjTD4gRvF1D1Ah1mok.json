The space is incredibly well-designed and they even have a sizable outdoor patio which is perfect given the current covid issues. It's modern, cultural and comfortable. Doma will for sure be in the regular rotation.",

Very friendly & quick service, excellent breakfast sandwich (a touch of honey!) and exactly the oat milk latte I've been craving! They even have a take-out window that's perfect during COVID times or for a quick stop-through while commuting down Orleans. The perfect addition to our area.",
