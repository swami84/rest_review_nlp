They have all the typical Korean BBQ type offerings such classic Korean style rice plates, but I was blown away by their spice oxtail soup.  The only reason why I went there is because I noticed this barely noticeable place while parked across the street the week before and it caught my eye.  I was looking for something new, since we have hit up just about every Korean joint in town and it was the the right timing that day to give it a try, plus lots of street parking was open.  The dish that did it for me, was the spicy oxtail soup. It was a big bowl of spicy yumminess filled with decent size oxtails and lots of veggies all served piping hot.  It really hit the spot.  If spicy is not your thing, they also offer it in mild and is just as good, but you are really missing out if you don't get the spicy version.  Mom runs the kitchen and her daughter helps out in front. It is the perfect team and they are both very friendly.  Mom sent out some fried mandoo as gratis and they were the bomb. They were cooked perfectly and very different then other fried mandoo I have had in the past.  She even had her own homemade sauce that was amazing.  Check this place out and support a small local business. You won't be disappointed.",
