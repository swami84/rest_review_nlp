Homemade pasta, the right bread, all fresh ingredients, you won\u2019t find these elements at your everyday Italian restaurant around the corner.

Our steak was done just right, the brussel sprouts so flavorful, prosciutto and mozzarella - oh wow what fresh mozzarella, and lastly the pasta dishes. I hope they're doing well in these tough times.

First I will say the food is great and that's why we keep giving the place another chance but as far as far as wait times for food its simply UNACCEPTABLE. On several occasions most recently last week I have ordered food to be delivered or picked up and have had to wait well over an hour. I understand sometimes restaurants are busy or are short staff or even have a bad day but this has happened well before covid and is still happening. Its unacceptable to put in an order to go and have to wait an hour sometimes more for it. I have worked in the restaurant business for years and every place I have worked would never allow a meal to take more then 20 minutes once its ordered and even that is a stretch. Either they need to retrain their kitchen staff or hire more employees cause if you keep making people wait hours for food you are going to keep loosing customers.",

While standing in front of Piccante, a guy walked by us, turned around and told us that if we were looking for food that we NEEDED to go in to Piccante. \u201cI live in the neighborhood and eat there at least 3 times a week!\u201d he insisted. How could we argue with that?! Our minds were blown by the food. The first time we were there we ate dinner there twice in 3 days. It was that good! While the food is definitely a major reason for going, we find ourselves going back each time to experience the joy that is Marta and her family. See, this place is a small, family owned restaurant. They are sweet. They have a little daughter who sometimes is there with them. There is a palpable feeling of love in the space and in each amazing dish that comes out. The pasta is made fresh and is amazing, the spinach. OH the spinach! There\u2019s also this butternut squash/mushroom tower thing made with a balsamic reduction. It was heavenly. We have had such a wide variety of dishes and each one is delicious. GO TO PICCANTE! That\u2019s all I can say.",

The restaurant has been open for a year. The location was formerly occupied by Polonica for a long time until their move further down Third Avenue. The decor at Piccante is very simple. I only noticed a couple of Italian posters located by the entrance, otherwise the place is very austere. We got there around 4pm and there was no one else there, we had the place all to ourselves the entire time we were there. Marta was our server, we think she's the owner, and she was terrific. She told us that everything was homemade. She also said that nothing was premade, so they could add or remove any ingredient we wanted. A basket of freshly baked bread was brought to the table. We all raved about the food that we ordered. My wife ordered the soup of the day and she said it was sublime. For my main course I ordered the seafood risotto, which was really delicious. A photo of it will be posted with this review. We could not have been happier with the meal and service at Piccante. Needless to say, we're coming back soon.",

Ordered the Milano pasta, and asked Marta, the owner to make it creamy and it came out just the way we like it, and hands down was one of the best pastas that I have had. The Tiramisu too was delicious. Not just the food, but also the service was very warm. Would definitely recommend this place, and will come again not once but many times.",

Best of all the pricing was surprisingly cheap.  Compared to places like Gino's looking at the menu the prices are surprisingly cheap.  You might be wondering how or why?  The answer is the entrees are actually portioned perfectly for one normal person.  Finally a meal where theres no leftovers to take home!  Btw the meal is enough food for a normal person.  Combined that with a nice and attentive staff and you got yourself a winner.",

So far, I have had two of their dishes (risotto with spicy Italian sausage and the fettuccine eggplant mozzarella) and I love them both. The restaurant is a small cute place with seating for 30. I love that the decorations are subtle and basic, so it is not overwhelming (I cannot do the over stimulation of colors and intense decor).
