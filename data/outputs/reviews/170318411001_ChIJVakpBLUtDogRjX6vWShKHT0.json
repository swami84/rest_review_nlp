You get to appreciate the fish for what it really is, an entire creature you're consuming and being thankful for the sustanance it's providing you.

My only other reason for not giving them more stars was the price, bit high for Chinatown.  Other that, not many complaints. We did not have to wait at all, the restaurant was very clean, nice decor, well designed menus, fun little amuse bouche before the meal (although, unless it was a tongue in cheek allusion at being in Chicago, I would have kept the popcorn off that plate). We had two appetizers (the chilled okra in sweet garlic sauce, which was indeed very good, and the sliced beef and offal with chili sauce that I did not particularly enjoy because of its strange overall flavor, it tasted almost like soap). For the main course, we had a fish with two sauces. Turned up to be too much food for two, which we kinda had expected. The food came out almost immediately, and it was very tasty.  I truly enjoyed the experience. A little bit less next morning going to the bathroom... I was fine, my husband decidedly not. Enough said. Not sure it was the chilies, or more than just the chilies.  So - bit of a mixed review. Might go back for the BBQ - or not.",

Portion size is great for a party of two, but was slightly underwhelming for a party of 4, as the fish itself is very light, therefore not very filling.  Overall, I'd recommend any dish here to anyone, and I look forward to coming back to try the steamed chicken appetizer. Call ahead and get yourself on the wait list before arriving. Plan to stay here for at least 2 hours, the fish itself will take approximately 40 minutes to cook.",
