The sandwiches I will miss the most. Just amazing sandwiches that make me salivate while I write this. Watching the staff prep the food while the music is blasting when you wait is part of the experience of this local neighborhood staple. But its Joe that really makes this place special. No bs guy who knows food with a great heart. I once crutched in a day before Thanksgiving with no where to go due to my injury. Joe said he was sold out of Thanksgiving food. But then managed to scratch together a bit of extras and I was magically able to buy a few plates. I was touched by the generosity. One of the nicest things someone has done for me. I wish Brancaccio's the most success. I will visit when I'm back.",

Small spot, with authentic gourmet Italian ingredients, perfectly seasoned, sauteed, and or baked. The flavors are paired so well there is nothing I won't try that Joe makes. My girlfriend hates mustard and she eats a sandwich with mustard on it from Brancaccio's. The Joe is a great guy, straight to the point and no BS. His food is straight up ridiculously amazing and nothing less. Whoever gave this place a one star review is lying to themselves, the food is the best you ever had or you should stick to eating fast-food. Poor snowflakes, leave your entitled attitude at the door, don't question the artist on how he makes his art, just enjoy the art or move along.

(Updated The sandwiches are ridiculously delicious they are worth the wait!! Lots of choices for the sandwiches. They have unbelievably fresh ingredients, everything home-made, and the bread is the classic Italian thick crusted brooklyn bread you can't get anywhere else.) The food I had was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I can tell from the ingredients Joe the owner (nice guy) knows what he's doing for sure. The broccoli rabe & Penne was perfection. The bacon Macaroni & cheese well anything with bacon is good but the cheesiness was great , flavors mixed well and pasta cooked perfect. Ill be coming back asap for a sandwich!  Anyone in the area should check it out!",

I did not buy the chicken but it looks delicious. It was golden brown and the aroma was heavenly. I also heard the breakfast sandwiches are very good. The prices are reasonable. The staff is very friendly. i will be back.",

I walked in one evening, starving after a pedi, to grab dinner and walked out with spicy pasta accompanied by the most deliciously roasted tomatoes EVER. I have since been back and am glad to see that the roasted tomatoes, crusted with parmesan and stuffed with garlic are likely menu regulars. The staff is friendly and I always see the owner, who I always thank for bringing this deliciousness to Kensington. Word is that they're switching storefronts and expanding, but not to restaurant proportions. That's fine by me since I like to bring the delicious food home!",
