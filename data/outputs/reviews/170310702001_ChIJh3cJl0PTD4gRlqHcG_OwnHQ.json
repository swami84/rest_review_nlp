I spoke to the manager at this location and mentioned to him that the driver didn't have the receipt with him and so i ended up not being able to sign it. So, of course the tip amount line was blank since he didn't have the receipt with him. I called the store soon after the driver left my home to make them aware that if they do see a tip amount it wasn't from me or authorized with my signature. He went on to say that \" we don't employ people like that so no need to worry\" I get a call back from another manager within five minutes after i hung up with him and said the driver DID leave a tip for himself! I called their customer service headquarters to inform them. This driver messed with the wrong customer.  I had two babies upstairs that i couldn't leave unattended for me to wait for him to go back to his car to get the receipt. I ALWAYS tip but this is beyond what someone should take upon themselves to do that. I am NEVER GOING TO BE A PAPA JOHNS CUSTOMER EVER AGAIN!",

I ordered my food with uber eats and after I placed the order it said it would be arriving in the next 20 minutes. I was okay with that, still questioning the time as I am a DePaul student right down the street. As I came down to wait the last 5 minutes, the time went up 5 more minutes each time, then ten minutes, then another ten minute. I thought it was UberEats fault, so I called the restaurant and asked what the hold up was and the lady said there were many uber cars that came but no one had a \"bag\". I then asked her if someone picked up the food then and she said someone is on their way. I hung up and the timer went another 15 minutes. So I waited 40 minutes for CHEESE STICKS which SHOULD NOT take that long. The uber driver said that it was the restaurants fault because they didn't give the food to the first driver that came originally came. Your food might not be that hot anymore since it took so long. She was right. I was VERY disappointment and refuse to refer this place to anyone, I didn't even want the rest of the cheese sticks I ordered, and I definitely will NOT be referring DePaul students to come here. Horrible Service. Never again.",

I just showed up and they gave me the pizza and I asked if I had to sign anything and they said no. So that is kind of a big problem especially if the delivery driver is an idiot and goes to the wrong place or delivers to the wrong guy which is what happened the next time I ordered.  Last week when I ordered a pizza, the expected delivery time was about 30-40 minutes. Papa Johns allows me to use the Zoomer App to track our delivery driver. I use it and I thought that he was on his way and well he took a long stop at the wrong place far away... So 1 hour and 30 minutes passes by..... and I call and ask where is this guy? The person answers the phone and says your order is complete and then hangs up. I had to then call about 10 times before I could get someone to pick up again and I called to cancel and told them how the delivery driver is an idiot and probably delivered the wrong place.  And 20 minutes later I was walking to carry out from Pizza Hut and the incompetent delivery driver calls me and says he'll be there in 4 minutes. I had no idea who he was, he just called and said \"I'll be there in 4 minutes,\" He sounded creepy and I had to double check and ask who he was and he said this in a creepy way \"Who am I? Who am I? I am the delivery guy\" and I told this creep that I cancelled a while ago.  Oh and it gets worse. I go on the Papa Johns website to fill out a Feedback Form to explain to them how pissed I was at their service and how incompetent it was. They never responded to me. In fact, it wasn't until today I found out that they closed the complaint with no response/comments even though they never responded to me at any point. I've had to call the customer service line many times to talk about how garbage the service is here and how the owner doesn't care and the customer service is pathetic here. They said they would escalate it to higher service and at the end? All they did was call this store and because it is a franchise, they decided to just not care about my situation.  The service here is the epitome of a disgrace and so is the owner.",

Since the staff in this location is very small and frequently there are only around two employees in the whole place, they get away with a lot of bad behavior. I called in today politely and asked them if they had any specials, as I have done many times in the past. This time when I got a papa john's representative, a white male, who was very rude. He told that they \"had a lot of specials\" that day. I chuckled and said \"awesome, what are they?\" And he said \"there were too many, he was not going to list all of them.\" I was taken aback at first and thought he was kidding, and then I realized her was serious. He said \"just tell me what pizza you want and tell you if it's in special.\" I told him, I wasn't sure what pizza I wanted. How many specials are there exactly? I heard a click and then I asked \"well can you please tell me about your single pie specials?\", only to find out the man had just rudely hung up. I was appalled. I called back and asked him why he hung up on me. He said because he felt like it or something to that affect. I said I was going to come down into the store this is unacceptable. So i walk down to the store and I asked him if he was the one who just hung up on me. He said \"mostly likely, so? What's the big deal?\" I said excuse me? I've worked in hospitality for almost 10 years (not in a pizza shop) but I would never treat customers like that it's so professional. I also confronted him and saidthat I saw the sign outside that listed the specials and their were only two. Both single pie deals. So why exactly did he make it seem as though there were 20 specials he had to read off. Mind you, the store was completely empty, so he was not busy. He was just standing there doing nothing the whole time. I once again tell him this is no way to talk to customers and I hope those phone calls are recorded. He then, this is the part where it gets even more ridiculous, starts cursing and yelling at me and then tell me to \"get the F*** out.\" The whole time I was talking to him, I was not yelling, I was as respectful as one could be in the situation and calm while he was erratic. I then told him, \"oh, so now you're yelling and cursing at customers who would like to buy pizza as well?\" I asked him for his name and he refuses to give it to me. Probably because he knows he was breaking rules. I asked if I order a pizza would his name be on the receipt. He said no. I told him I don't feel comfortable ordering with you is there any other employee in here. He says there's one in the back, I say perfect can you please ask him to come out. He says no. So I say I will wait until the employee comes out from the back. He says once again I have to \"get the F*** out if I'm not ordering\" (as if I would order from the man yelling and cursing at me and being completely unapologetic. I sit there quietly and wait for the other employee to appear. Finally a man comes out from the back. I ask him what is the man's name who was cursing at me. He says his name was \"Mike\". I ask him if he's the general manager or the shift manager, he alleges he doesn't know because he's new and looks nervous. I asked him if I could order with him, and he says no I would have to order from \"mike\". This \"mike\" person said he would call the police to coerce me to leave. I say that's fine, once they get here I will get your name &leave. While I am in the store, I called corporate to report him. The police come i gladly agree to leave and ask them to ask his name. They ask his name he says \"mike\" and refuses to give his last name. The police say corporate can verify his real name since they will have the employees schedule. While I was sitting there waiting for the police to come quietly, the \"mike\" person who alleged he was a manager is STARING at me menacingly as if to make me uncomfortable. It was insane. This man should not be working in customer service. It was scary. Then I decide to take a photo of him and he tries to hide and takes a photo of me. .",

I asked for fresh pizza she initially refused to do a fresh one. Then she agreed to do a fresh pizza and would take 45 more mins.  Then the GM named Serina tunstill took the call and said she is the GM and started saying that delivery guy brought the pizza but you didnt pick the call which is a lie and conflicting. Then she was rude and started saying that either cancel it or wait for 40 more mins and said that I dont have any option and they didnt even apologize for the delay and when I asked to do something for inconvenience they refused. She said I am the GM and even if you complain, it would be coming to me.  Terrible customer service!! Papa john's dont care about people and delays.  Dont order from this location!!! Avoid it.",

First of all, we were told it would be a 2 hour wait for our order, which was understandable being that it was a busy night in Chicago. We waited 2 hours & 20 minutes before calling to check on our order status only to be told that we were \"behind 25 other orders,\" and our pizza hadn't even been started. I asked to cancel our order and to speak with a manager and was told that my name and number were being placed on a list for the manager and to expect a follow-up the next day to \"make things right.\" No call the next day, so I followed up with the store two days later. The man who answered was extremely condescending, stating that \"literally there was no way to contact (me) to say the order would be late.\" I think email could've worked just fine. I asked to speak to a manager, and he said he was a manager. I asked to speak to the owner, which was denied. So, then I asked for the worker's name, and he replied, \"Why would I give you my name?! So you can file a complaint?!\" I figured if he really was a store manager then he would be comfortable giving customers his name. Then, the man hung up on me. I tried calling back 4 times immediately after that to make sure he didn't think I hung up on him, but they just picked up and immediately hung up the line. Extremely unprofessional! Sorry for the long review, but I cannot say enough negative things about this location. I will NEVER order from them again and will honestly think twice the next time I want to order from ANY Papa John's location.",

Called to place my order and after about 12 minutes of being in hold was able to do so with an employee who didn't seem to be \"with it\" enough to complete the order without me having to repeat my responses 3-4 times (this did not seem to be for clarification or accuracy, mind you). After being put on hold once again in order to complete the order with manager assistance (apparently my 3 topping large was too complicated to get into the system?), I was informed to expect my delivery in 1 hour. No problem, I was looking forward to unwinding after a long week anyways...  1 hour passes. 1 hour 10 minutes pass. 1 hour 20 minutes pass.  At 1 hour 30 minutes I called to check on my order and was assured the pizza had already left for delivery.  5 more minutes pass. 10 more minutes pass. 15 more minutes pass.  (I live 5 a minute drive from the location mind you).  With 1 hour 45 minutes having passed, I was fed up, called back, and canceled the order (which they did do no questions asked, which I appreciated). I also requested to speak to the manager to ensure they were aware of my experience, who informed me I should have been told the wait would have been 1 hour and 20 minutes (as if that would have been better?) but that since my order was \"already on the way\" that I could still have the pizza on the house.  Seemed like a kind and potentially redeeming gesture...  5 minutes pass. 10 minutes pass.  (So much for that pizza already being out for delivery)  The pizza arrives!  First look at the box, and I should have just sent it back: smushed from the weight of other boxes and slightly soggy from the pizza greese already soaked through, the box's cardboard lip was also torn straight through where the finger hole is to lift open. The warmth, or lack thereof, of this woeful excuse for a pizza box did not bode well for its contents, either: already barely luke-warm on the bottom of the box. Contained within was a pizza whose cheese had already hardened and with indents in the cheese revealing toppings that had been picked-off (I checked the box for rouge toppings that may have fallen off, but none were to be found).  So much for that \"redeeming gesture\", so much for my enjoyable, relaxing evening after a long week, and so much for my business with this Papa Johns location.  WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION AGAIN.",
