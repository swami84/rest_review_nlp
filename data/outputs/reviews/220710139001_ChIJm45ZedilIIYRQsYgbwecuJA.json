        "caption": "I recently ate at the 14 Parishes pop-up inside of the Pythian Market at Loyola and Gravier. I had the jerk chicken with rice & peas and cabbage. It was completely insane! So far it\u2019s the best food I\u2019ve had in New Orleans! The chicken fell off the bone and was so flavorful. The jerk bbq sauce was extremely tasty as well. The cabbage and rice were both super delicious and filling. I also got a small side of habanero that was truly spicy but also very well balanced. Thank you so much 14 Parishes!",
