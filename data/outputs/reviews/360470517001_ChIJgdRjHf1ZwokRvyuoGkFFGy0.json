They advertise frozen margaritas and then I found out after ordering and, having to ask,that they do not have tequila.  15 dollars for a non tequila margarita?! They also tasted nasty.  So i called the server to come take the drinks and then he said he was going to bring us micheladas which took forever, keep in mind The place was literally empty besides my table.  Due to covid, I had to get food with our terrible drinks, so I got an order of guacamole and chips which were decent but definitely not worth $13.  When going to pay, the server wanted to charge me for a margarita and then told me I didn\u2019t annunciciate myself when I asked him to take them.  So I pointed to the full \u201cmarg\u201d and said yes, I asked you to take that.  If you want good food and drinks, find a different spot- this ain\u2019t it.",

Has a ton of events lined up in a great space in the back!  Pricing: happy hour pricing is pretty fair, and really great for the food. Taco fans will be pretty happy with $3 and $4 tacos. Drinks are also fairly priced.  Food and drinks: cauliflower app was nice but could have been slightly more charred. For tacos,  we had the shrimp, the steak, the fish, and the mixed one called the governador. Fish, mixed, and shrimp were awesome! Steak was cooked a bit too tough.  The enchiladas had abb amazing sauce to it and the meat was seasoned well. We had both the red and white sangria and it was a wonderful mix of boozy and sweet.  Verdict: while the place does check off a lot of boxes and in some places more than others, and I'm forgiving of the wait staff, the food needs to be the star of the show. Having a bit of a tough steak taco is hard for me to chew on - pun intended.",

I\u2019ll start by saying i understand it\u2019s Valentines Day, but I still expected at least semi good service. We walked in without a reservation which was no problem. The hostess cleared a table and sat us down without wiping the table down, so as I sat down and saw food scraps on the table i politely asked if she could wipe it down. That was already a first bad impression. She brought over the silverware and glasses and forgot one glass and never brought one over for me. We never had an actual server come up to us until about 15-20 minutes later, which felt like forever. And I think this woman was the bartender. She was very sweet. We ordered from the pre fixed menu which included salsa and chips. We sat there for maybe 30-45 minutes until finally a gentleman came up to us (after I stared him down for half that time) to ask if we had placed an order yet. So, we were completely ignored this entire time. Mind you, the place was not busy up front. I mentioned the chips and he brought them over. The food was okay.. offering a complimentary drink or dessert would\u2019ve gone a long way; as I overheard them do that for the table sitting next to us. But I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!",

Most surprisingly perhaps was how bad the chips and salsa were that came to the table. This should be a layup, but the chips were no better than cheap store bought \"restaurant style\" ones without enough salt. The tacos al pastor were also a let down. The meat was dry and unrecognizable as pork, and came with no pineapple. I asked where the pineapple was, as it typically cooks on a spit above the meat, but was told there's none left, that it all cooked off. Can't recommend going back here with so many other options for similar cuisine around Brooklyn.",
