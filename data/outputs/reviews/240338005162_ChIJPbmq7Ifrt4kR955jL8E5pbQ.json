My mom was a first time patron of whom had called to inquire about a food item and the specific ingredients.  While speaking with the young lady roughly a month ago, she had become somewhat dismissive relative to her communication with my mother.  While in the background listening, I kindly asked my mom (a senior), to hand me the phone.  In my direct communication with the location, I respectfully and kindly asked the young lady to whom my mom was speaking with, was there an issue in regards to the way that you were speaking with the customer ie my mother with such unprofessionalism?  The young lady had become very much \u201cSMART MOUTHED\u201d and by this time I had advised that I would be coming in along with my mother shortly to speak with the Manager, as I will not tolerate such disrespect from a \u201cYOUNG SMART MOUTH\u201d.  When arriving to speak with the Manager/Owner, they too had become very much smart mouthed and rude.  To add, I\u2019m one of the nicest and most professional persons that one could meet but as a fifty year old man, father of adult kids, and a husband, \u201cI WILL NEVER TOLERATE\u201d rude behavior and or interaction as a paying consumer in any capacity, especially from a \u201csmart mouth youngster\u201d or anyone for that matter.  And because of the interaction and biased behavior(s), I will \u201cNEVER\u201d patronize this location in the future.  I always advise folk to \u201cspend your money where you feel appreciated in doing so\u201d.  Keep in mind that certain \u201cCULTURES\u201d are looked upon as being \u201cINFERIOR\u201d and because of that, your dealt with in certain biased regards.

I would gladly spend double the amount of money, but only for food with this level of quality. Aside from quality, the quantity alone is outstanding.  Superior food, large portions, great prices.... I have yet to figure out how they manage to make their sushi *ALWAYS FRESH* every single time I order, in record timing. It\u2019s outstanding. But I think overall, considering I have only a select few \u201csushi places\u201d that I am willing to go to......the one thing that no other restaurant has (within at least a 20 mile radius, literally) that Ichiban Sushi of Bowie DOES HAVE = stellar customer service.  The girl that works up front (I don\u2019t want to throw out names) has been there for as long as I can remember. And she alone, has proven to be a major asset to this restaurant. I truly hope that her superiors and management recognize this and acknowledge it as well.  I think it\u2019s awesome that someone her age, has the maturity and the drive to take the lead...not just in terms of creating a great reputation.  But she\u2019s made a mark on that place that is financially beneficial and the reputation that they now have....will last a lifetime.  She has officially proven that \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d theory, does not apply to every restaurant! Because I can promise you, if there\u2019s any \u201cproblem\u201d when ordering from this place.....the customer is definitely wrong.  Especially if the customers name is Karen\ud83d\ude02  Seriously, this girl needs a raise before another restaurant recruits her. Lol. \ud83d\udc9c \ud83d\udcb0  -Brittany",

So you open at 11am and your front door is locked at 11:15am but your staff is standing there looking at customers through the door. We were seated by a young lady who barely greeted us. We ordered our food. In the meantime other parties were being seated. Tables that came in after us received their food first. No speciality dishes were ordered. The same rude young lady brings just rice to our table holding the bowl with the palm of her hand covering the rice. DISGUSTING !!! Removed plates from our table without asking if we were finished. Served us hot water. The list goes on and on. Ichiban use to be one of my favorite places. I can no longer say that.",

So when I went to pick up the food with my sister and a friend's daughter I spoke to her about the phone call. She justified her actions not once saying she was sorry about being rude and loud over the phone. Then, my friend's daughter (14 year old) who had watched the entire exchange said to her \"you should say sorry.\"  Which she very grudgingly did but then went on to say to my sister that if we did not like the service then we could go somewhere else..

I told the waitress to wait for my order because I had to get off my seat to read the special menu. Guess what, he left and didnt come back. We had to call a different waiteress to serve, very nice girl by the way. Food was great. We went a second time, we found hair on his food... call the manager, and he said it's not hair, it's a thread from the rice bag which was a lie. (I can make a difference between hair and thread) He offered to pay for the food but we refused, we said it's ok and paid for everything. Giving them the benefits of doubt, we went a third time. After we were escorted to a table, we waited 20 minutes. There was 2 waiters, none of them acknowledge us. It seemed like they were not even happy at all. We were tired of waiting. We just got up and left the restaurant. The vibe there is different. I feel like something is off. Somebody need to investigate this place. By the way, do not order sushi to go, they will give you a pre made meal stored from the fridge. (Like store bought sushi) The skin they use to make the sushi is chewy. I don't  usually do reviews but this has been on my mind since last time I went there (3 weeks ago).By the way, the food there has great taste. Just watch out for hair and how they treat you. Won't be going back there for sure. We used to spend $60-80 each visit.",

I ordered the calamari and she ordered a tea. When she got the green tea it smelled like a rusty pot and it tasted metallic, nothing like classic green tea. My calamari was excellent. We then ordered our entree. She got a sushi bowl salad type thing with some sushi rolls and I got general tap chicken with Jasmine rice. Well again my meal, excellent but gets not so much. One bite into the bowl and she found a nice long thick juicy hair, very healthy, good texture and black. She was obviously disgusted. She asked for a remake but for whatever reason they couldn't make get another one (I'm guessing because it was closing time). So she ate her 4 shrimp rolls and I ordered her calamari appetizer since she had some of mines and enjoyed it, plus she was still hungry. She really did not enjoy the experience but my experience was decent. The atmosphere on the place was great. It was in a great location.",

I work out a lot and I\u2019m very conscious about protein and caloric intake.  In the past 2 weeks alone I\u2019ve spent near $80. On the shrimp tempura sushi rolls combined with the daily lunch sushi specials.  Well today I didn\u2019t want to eat at the gym so I said well I\u2019ll just eat inside today.  Well I was told that because I ordered from the take out side I could not eat my food that I just purchased inside of Ichiban! I didn\u2019t make a scene they tried to apologize and I left!  Thank you for the food I have eaten including today\u2019s meal because it will be my ABSOLUTE LAST TIME patronizing this establishment!!! Whatever happened to exemplary customer service which simply would have said \u201csir normally we don\u2019t but because you always support us etc etc\u201d",

The host seemed to be ill prepared for a party of two as while the restaurant was mostly empty the suggestion of sitting at the sushi bar was the offer over moving a small table from a larger. The service was less than attentive with the waitress for the bar looking at her phone and chatting with other staff over casual attention to her table. The fist salad brought out was a collection of browned iceberg lettuce and had to be sent back for a non browned bowl. The sushi was mediocre and the expectation was not set high with the menu being so broad, not including a bento option, and the chopsticks lacked a stand to rest them and we're wrapped in the same place setting as the fork and knife. Overall a filling meal, but an a sub par experience with mediocre sushi.",

Would only recommend this place to the food service inspectors just so they could shut it down! If I could give it negative ratings, I would enthusiastically.  I ordered the mixed seafood dish and two of the four fish types were missing. I informed the waitress and four different servers came to the table with a large spoon and dug through the bowl with their noses almost touching the food itself! They were not only breathing nose deep but four different people were picking through it to find the food. They never found the two missing fish types and asked to bring the whole dish back to the kitchen. When I refused and asked them instead to just bring the two missing fish to the table without returning the food, they said that the two fish was in there (even though no one could find it after multiple attempts) and just walked away. One of the servers kept moving her hair away from her face as she poked closely and peered through the dish with the spoon. A couple of strands landed happily inside and she just fished it out with the same spoon!!!  The server even made the comment that \"oh do you think we will put something in your food?\" And smirked. I was appalled! I complained and stated that they could just take the whole dish back. They left it on the table and refused to take the $25 (which was the cost) off the bill.  Absolutely disgusting all around. Would NEVER return, EVER! Avoid at all costs! Failing grades all around with the exception of the decor.",
