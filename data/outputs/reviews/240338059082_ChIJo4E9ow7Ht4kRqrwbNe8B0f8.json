The man-n-cheese, honestly no words I can\u2019t even imagine how it was prepared, chick-fil-a\u2019s mac-n-cheese is 30x better. The fries were not the fries from the pic, they were wedges that didn\u2019t taste good at all. My daughter says the fried catfish was good and that was it. Very disappointed, I wish I would have spent my money on calories at the Cheesecake Factory. It is rare that I write a review, but this was a HUGE catfish. Decided to give it a shot with limited reviews thinking it was a new spot. The service was good.

It's like a local IHOP but so much cheaper and so much better.  Anyways yeah it's worth it, food is delicious and strikes a balance of \"tasty from a restaurant\" but also somewhat...comforting, like home cooking. The server was so friendly and kind too, so sweet, and I'm definitely a fan now. Absolutely recommend if you're looking for comfort food or a midday breakfast (with giant serving portions nonetheless!)

I tried the steak and eggs, which I requested to be medium. At best the steak was well done and lacked flavour. To say the least I was disappointed, because the pictures on instagram looked very promising. However, the food was not good at all. Definitely false  advertisement.

Both bacon and sasuge, with turkey alternatives for both, are so freaken good. Kudos to them for making these bomb breakfast sandwiches.  The meats are cooked well and taste better. Eggs any way you like. Waffle batter is good. Grits were good. Mixed with cheese, salt and pepper, however a bit peppery, but good none the less. Its at a good location and essy to find. The staff is very nice and patient. Its only 3 of them back there, so they properly prepare each order so that everyone receives the same quality of food, which hasnt diminished so far. So there is a small wait if there is a line, but totally worth the wait.  I havent tried out their lunch items yet, but definitely gonna try and review them at a later date. I will mention that the pricing is fair, but can quickly become expensive with add-ons. The meals feel proportionate. The platters are big and filling. No real complaints there. As far as breakfast goes, i highly recommend visiting.",
