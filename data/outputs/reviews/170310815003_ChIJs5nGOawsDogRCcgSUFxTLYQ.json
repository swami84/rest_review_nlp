He was not the friendliest person, and did not explain what was an extra cost in the meal (I suppose to make his tip big). However we had a group of 6 ppl you shouldn\u2019t have to device ppl. The crazy thing about it I was planning on tipping our waiter more money at the end until I notice his attitude and snarky remarks to another person at the table. The server name was Max.  My guest also were at the bar in the beginning before the rest of us got there. The bartender was even more rude. She did not get an extra tip.  So for the service I would give Eddie V\u2019s a rating of 0.  For the food. It was absolutely amazing. My sister enjoyed every bit of her bday dinner. I would order from there for take out but I would never din there again. The food I\u2019d give a 4.",

My girlfriend and I discovered this this a few years ago, have been many times, and a recent terrible experience at another steakhouse reminded me how a positive review for Eddie V's is very overdo.  The ambiance and general feel of the restaurant is a perfect mix of classy, romantic, but modern.  The Jazz vibes are welcome and whether at the bar or the booth, it's a good experience.  I've had many things here, but what always sticks out to me is that you can get a fantastic steak (both filet and NY strip are excellent) that is good every time and undercuts other big name steakhouses on price. Another big winner, which I believe is only on special once in a while, is the smoked old fashion which uses fresh smoked wood to essence the glass before a table side cocktail is made.  This drink is pricey, but worth every penny.  In 3 years and several visits I don't think we've had a side that wasn't good so you really can't wrong there.  I can't comment on the seafood as it's hard to not take advantage of the great steak, but maybe some day.  This is a go to spot for us and I have recommended it to many others.  Only thing I don't like is that the popularity is catching on over the last year or two it's harder for us to get a last minute reservation now!",

He was so knowledgeable on the drinks and the menu that everything he suggested, we ended up ordering! We did the tuna tar tare which was one of the best I've ever had! We did a few oysters which were also great, very fresh. We did the 4 oz twin filets with lobster (all cooked perfectly), then we added on a 1/2 lb of king crab legs (these were a bit overcooked), Brussel sprouts were completely fabulous! This meal was so great! Thanks, Matt for such fantastic service! We'll be back to see you!",

The good parts of my visits here is that the servers have always been on point with their service and doing their best to make sure their tables are taken care of.  This place does get busy so be prepared for a bit of a wait. On this last visit we started with the tuna tartar (which is always fabulous), we then had the lobster bisque and the crispy shrimp (both were solid) but for the main dishes is where it just didn't hit the mark. My dinner guest had the filet mignon and I had the salmon.  So for starters the filet mignon was overcooked it was closer to well done instead of the medium rare that my guest requested, and way to much truffle that overwhelmed the mashed potatoes.  My salmon was cooked beautifully but lacked salt, and the carrots and spinach were just not there.  The carrots were undercooked and just oddly hard and the spinach was mushy and had an almost bitter taste.  We also opted for getting the truffle mac & cheese as a side but again heavyhanded with the truffle and missing some salt. We ended the night with a sorbet and that was a great palate cleanser.  So overall a safe choice if you're in the area but for me I think it might be a while before I visit again.",

We came in without any reservations for our 2 year anniversary and we told them that it was our anniversary when they asked if we were celebrating anything and they decorated our table with little hearts and left us a happy anniversary card for us! The food was all so delicious. The oysters were so fresh and yummy, the steak tartare was SOOO GOOD! Everything we had was scrumptious! They even brought us a free anniversary dessert which they flamb\u00e9ed and free glass of champagne! It was such an amazing experience and we'll be back time and time again! This place will definitely be our new go too and tradition! Thank you for the wonderful experience!!",

Great conversation and then we noticed people around us were being served and leaving while we were still waiting.  Our out of town guest went to the Manager at 10:05 and then our food started to arrive.  I should\u2019ve cancelled my order!  To apologize they brought us dessert.  My parking should\u2019ve been $16.00 but we were there longer than 4 hours which made it $28.00.  The only reason our out of town guest chose Eddie V\u2019s because of their experience in Charlotte, NC.  We had others things to do which were cancelled due to this horrible service. 315.00 bill for just me and my husband (includes a 47.00 tip).  The best part of my visit was my lemon drop martini from the bar from the gentleman in black.  Brian was our server and I won\u2019t be back for dinner.",

While we were seated at the worst table in the house (outside the kitchen door and near the restrooms) the waiter made a real difference. His low key approach was what we needed after a day of touristing. After cocktails he made superb recommendations for two different fish dishes. If they have the fresh off the cob corn, get that too.....Our only problem was too much food and/or too little appetite. All in all, a nice new friend, but be more picky about your table than we were......",

They started us off with some kind of warm, fresh bread with seasoned butter. Then we each tried a Gigamoto oyster on the half shell. I added a little of their wine reduction with onion and cracked pepper. For the appetizer we shared a jumbo lump crab cake, sauteed Maryland style with spicy chive remoulade. For the entree I had Bacon wrapped filet mignon Oscar style with Alaskan king crab and a delicious bernaise sauce. It came with roasted asparagus and we added lobster mashed potatoes. My dinner date had the Chilean sea bass with soy broth and spinach. Both were delicious. By the time we finished there wasn't room for dessert, but their options sounded amazing.",

Dinner was a filet mignon that just melts in your mouth, so full of flavor. Truffle mac and cheese was by far the best side I got to try. Finished the night off with a molten godiva chocolate cake that was just as amazing as the food before it. Topped off with great ambiance and fantastic customer service, that dinner will be remembered as one of the finest I've ever had. Really hope to be able to make it out to Eddie Vs again some day!",
