Three issues when food was picked up: 1. The pizza was NOT well done and the slices weren't fully cut (bottom of the pizza were still intact, so I had to cut the slices apart); 2) half the pizza was \"The Works\" WITH olives and the other half was just plain cheese pizza, no toppings; 3. the soda given in a bag was regular Pepsi, not the ordered Pepsi Max.

When I arrived to the store for the pick up, the man at the register asked for my name and the debit card.  I told him my name and told him I forgot my debit card home. So he asked for my ID and I gave it to him.  He immediately called his manager who looked at my ID and basically interrogated me,  asking if it was my first time purchasing there and etc.  After an intense debate about if I ever purchased at the store.  I immediately responded and said, \u201cyou got my ID which is the same name and addressed on the debit card used, so you think I\u2019m some type of scammer?\u201d  He replied \u201cit\u2019s policy, but I\u2019m going to give you the pizza\u201d  He made it seems like he was doing me the favor as if he didn\u2019t have to give me the pizza I paid for.

I never received the pizza and ended up ordering from DOMINOES which had no problem getting my pizza to me in less than an hour. I called the next day for a refund and was told I would hear from a manager 3 days later they said the same thing. I then went to fb to lodge a complaint as they hate bad reviews but especially on social media and got the two responses that you see in attached photos. Since then i haven't heard from the owner, the fb page admin. or the store so basically they are out here stealing peoples money. I counted and collected 6 complains so far similar to mine and will be looking into a lawsuit.",
