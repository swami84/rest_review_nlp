The fresh pasta  flavors and herbs melded together so beautifuly. We loved all 3 dishes eggplant rollatini    Ravioli  Bolognese  and  fettuccine Alfredo with a beautiful focaccia bread to complement our meal. The Caesar salad to start the meal was perfect. We are looking forward to the tiramisu ,the end to our perfect night in! Kudos to Chef Kevin And his team . 6 stars !!!!",

The food is delicious\u2026 My girlfriend had the short ribs and I had the chicken puttanesca, both were quite generous potions. The mussels and the Bellini cocktails were fabulous as was the outstanding service that we received from the staff.  This menu may just be the best value in the Old Port. Large portions for a below average price with the highest quality of ingredients...great combination in my humble opinion!  Definitely a must go to place if your looking for a romantic authentic Italian dinner on a budget!",

Prosciutto and melon... perfectly fresh, sweet, tender melon and nice prosciutto even if it was a bit too thin. I could eat that dish all day. Bf got braised pork with pasta and beans and greens etc. And was very happy with it. I tried it and also thought it was delicious, though the pasta cuts were a little beyond rustic and ranged from fettuccine to almost a ravioli sheet, with some pappardelle in between. I got tortellini in brodo. Considering it was only $6 I wasn't expecting a ton, and was surprised by a large bowl. Pretty much just tasted like parsley it was garnished with so much of it. And there were four large, obviously homemade tortellini. Always love handmade pasta. Issue was that they were so big you had to cut into them but the filling was just straight cheese, I assume, because immediately after cutting into it it all dissolved into the broth and left be with wet empty pasta. Also one of the four arrived exploded which was a shame but after eating the others and losing the filling I guess it didn't make much difference. This was all acceptable, and totally fine. Whatever. The main issue was that we arrived around 5:45 to a half empty restaurant. Took about half an hour for our appetizer (slices of melon wrapped in prosciutto) and then about an hour after we had finished that for the entrees. Didn't realize they were braising the pork to order.... Lol. Wanted dessert because it looked great but didn't order it because we didn't want to wait another hour. Literally almost asked the waitress for the bread back. I get that it takes longer when you cook everything to order and make quality good, and especially when you only have two cooks, but come on, if you have less than ten tables to serve it should never take as long as it took last night, it was absurd. The food was great but I would honestly not go back because the wait was so ridiculous. And I don't mind waiting for good food we weren't in a rush but damn, get it together...",

        "caption": "Food was good but did not live up to expectations based on price.  The chef is a bit too fancy interpreting food from this region.  Tuscan food should have the fewest number of (great) ingredients possible.  For instance, my wife's ravioli was overpowered by the balsamic reduction - why mask the main part of the dish?!  My stuffed eggplant was a bit tasteless with lack-luster eggplant and cheese but tasty red sauce.  Apps (Caprese salad,  mussels) were excellent.  Once again, there was too much going on with the maple cheesecake with raspberry/balsamic(?) reduction dessert.  Service was excellent.",
