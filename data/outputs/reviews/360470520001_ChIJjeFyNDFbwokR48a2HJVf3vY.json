I've had the chance to meet the couple who own the restaurant through a friend, and hearing their story, makes it even more of a hit. Lovely local atmosphere, very crafty decorations, and a cute back patio area as well.  Highly recommend the Tocino dish... That one will always be a favorite. Nothing but love for this place and will always make it a point to come for a good meal.",

Salad taste like someone wipes the greens on the sweaty armpits as if they were taking a shower with them. Places these same greens on a plate and serves them up AS IF it was gourmet. This assault of my commons sense is to Skip The Purple Yam and walk up to the taco stand that is across street at the library and eat there instead.

        "caption": "Came here twice this month: weekend brunch and weeknight dinner. Both times, service was so slow after the first greeting. The food also took at least 20 minutes--even for appetizer (lumpia).  Lumpia Shanghai (brunch): good contrast of flavors between the spring roll and the pineapple sauce. The sauce also goes well with all the dishes. Portion was smaller than I expected with 4 rolls, cut in half for 8 pieces.  Pancit: the noodles had a really good bounce--not too mushy and not al dente.  Lechon: the weekend brunch portion is 6 pieces that are approx 2x2x2 big. It was nicely crispy and very oily but the pork meat was very tender. When I went on a weeknight, the price is almost double, and they give 4 pieces with one big piece (5\") attached to the bone. The soy sauce dip isn't necessary since the meat has so much flavor. The carrot turnip slaw is very sour.  Cured pork garlic rice (dinner): 2 pretty sunny eggs to make a heart shape (not sure if intentional). The garlic rice was not as flavorful as my weekend brunch experience. The grilled cured pork was so good! (It reminded me of Vietnamese grilled pork.) It was pretty burnt though with black grill marks on 90% of one side.  Cured beef garlic rice (brunch): same dish as above with different protein. It was definitely NOT grilled to blackness and the garlic rice was much more pungent.  Buko pie (brunch): it wasn't overly sweet, which was a good surprise. It also had purple-ish colors. The mascarpone ice cream is \ud83d\udcaf",

That is no shade to anybody's region or family recipe, however usually a note is provided stating that they are making the adobo with coconut milk vs the regular ingredients. For the people in the neighborhood I would just go to fob in downtown. I never thought that I would be saying to avoid a particular restaurant especially a Filipino one, and I don't think that is fair to suggest that. Instead I am saying that if you are looking for a traditional Filipino feel, then go to another restaurant, you're going out anyway.",

We heard so many great things about this restaurant and were very surprised to find literally nothing redeeming about any of our 4 dishes.  Lumpia Shanghai-- very standard spring rolls that don't stand out in any way. The sweet and sour pineapple sauce sounded good, but in reality didn't add much. Just like any other spring rolls anywhere else, but double the price.  (Forget the name, but it was a shrimp/veggie fritter) - very doughy. Bites with shrimp were okay, but overall really not much flavor. The dipping sauce with them was overpowering and not great.  Chicken Adobo- boring chicken in an okay sauce. Very let down by this one as this was the dish we were most excited for.  Pancit Bihon - noodles with basically no flavor, mixed with veggies with no flavor and a sweet pork that didn't go well with the dish. The chicken in it was fine but really still a let down.  Upset that we both felt nothing was good. The waiter even asked is what our favorite dish was- I had to think about each dish to see if I could find anything good to say, and going dish by dish, there was nothing I could even qualify as good.  Nothing was outright bad, but I will never be going back here.",

He was rude and I heard negative comments from him and negative comments from the kitchen.

It's different from my late grandmother's cooking but just as good and in some ways better. My family is from the Manila metro area so the cuisine is slightly different. Even though my parents are from a different part of the Philippines, we know good authentic pinoy food. Purple Yam is easily one of the best Filipino restaurants in NYC. All of my family heartily appreciate and approve of the food. All of the dishes are great, but it can be a little overwhelming to those unfamiliar with Filipino cuisine. Here are my recommendations for the newbies... For an appetizer start with the ukoy (deep fried veg-shrimp fritters) or lumpia Shanghai (egg rolls). For the entre, try the chicken adobo to start. For dessert order some halo-halo (mixture of shaved ice, milk, fruits, sweets) . Purple Yam concoction of this dessert is top notch. My favorite dessert is the champorado (chocolate rice porridge) with ice cream. With regards to beverages Chef Romy has a good selection of alcohol and soft drinks. In my opinion just go for the Calamansi juice. FYI, Calamansi is sort of a lemon lime orange hybrid. If you try it you will understand. It's good. You won't regret eating here. Prices are very reasonable.",

I should probably go back to the entree first...remember to get the pork belly in buns. It is a delicious slice of the juiciest pork jelly with green mango wrap in what seems like the perfect pairing of a simple bun. So amazing!

        "caption": "Traveled 2 hours from Manhattan (subway service delays) each way and the food at Purple Yam was totally worth it.  If you are expecting very traditional Filipino food, perhaps this isn't the place for you.  What makes this place special is they serve Filipino food with a twist (influences of Korean, Malay, and other Asian influences) -- and boy do they get it right.  While the portion sizes aren't large, this is New York City, and I would say their portions are reasonable for the price (for NYC standards).  The desserts are the BEST.  Period.  You can't go wrong with any of them.  Overall, fantastic restaurant.  Just make sure you know what kind of Filipino restaurant you're signing up for (to manage your own expectation).",
