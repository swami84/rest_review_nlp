I\u2019d compare the entr\u00e9e I had to something that would be served at the Cheesecake Factory, only more expensive. Nothing special and I certainly wasn\u2019t \u201cwow\u2019d.\u201d The pasta was a huge portion (way too much, in my opinion). Portion size doesn\u2019t make up for mediocracy. Everything but the salad dressing was under-seasoned and it would\u2019ve been nice if they served a piece of crusty baguette with the Briquette salad since there is a big dollop of goat cheese on the side by itself. The drinks were decent when we finally received them. The service was awful. This is not the place to bring clients that you\u2019re trying to impress. It seemed to me that they are grossly understaffed. It took almost 10 minutes for someone to realize we walked in the door at the time of our reservation (only about 25% of tables were occupied). The amount of time that it took to order drinks was excessive, and the order wasn\u2019t even correct the first time. The dining room is beautiful (and huge by New Orleans standards). There is so much potential, but food and service are very underwhelming. For the same price (maybe even a little less) and better service,you\u2019re much better-off going to Cochon or Peche.",

We were the first to enter when they opened and I do not believe that he was a waiter, the scheduled waiter was not yet there.  The receipt shows the name 'Toby'.  The appetizer scallops were subpar, they were undercooked, room temperature, and pricy at $5 per scallop.  My Snapper Ponchartrain, topped with a goodly portion of crabmeat & hollandaise sauce, & my wife's Shrimp Pasta Briquette were both outstanding.  We had the vanilla bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee for desert and it was to die for, it was perfect.  The hardened caramelized sugar crust make the audible 'crunch', a sign of perfection, when our spoons broke through to as good a Cr\u00e8me Brulee as I have ever tasted.  One detractor was a waiter that showed up after we were seated and eating.  He was distractingly loud and course of language & actions.  However, all things taken into account, our experience was 4.5 stars almost a 5 star.  One Year Ago...  I received a five star experience in quality food, excellent wait staff, really good atmosphere, and reasonable price!  'Tass' was great as she handled every job that I could see, Maitre d', hostess, waitress, and cashier.  She was well spoken, very friendly, and gave the correct amount of attentiveness, not too much and not too little.  I really liked the grilled red-fish!  The restaurant is large, open,  and well organized.",

We generally eat big family meals at home because we all love to cook and are all foodies, so eating out can be difficult.  But Briquette was a great experience on every level.  The service was incredible- we had 6 adults and two small children.  Some waiters can be impatient with kids but Elizabeth was on top of every need they had.  She also had the kitchen prepare a plate of buttered noodles for them which was so appreciated.  Our meal was delicious and perfectly prepared.  The house salad was delicious, the oysters and Brussels sprouts were all on point.  The blackened redfish was the best I have ever tasted, as well as the snapper, lamb shank and chicken Marsala.  Even the fettuccine Alfredo that came with the Marsala was divine.   We would have loved to have tried the dessert, but the portions are generous so no room!  (Not complaining- we loved every bite).  We will de definitely return, and sing their praises to all of our friends.  Thanks so much for a memorable thanksgiving dinner.",

It certainly wasn't for the service. Briquette has lacked good service for as long as I can remember. That Chef was the only reason I went there. My food was always perfect. No matter what he recomended it was always delicious and cooked to perfection. If anybody finds out where that Chef is cooking now please let me know. They took all the class out of that place now. Last time I will dine there. This was heartbreaking news and I suffered for the first time a plate I let just say I did not love. They have ruined this place!",

We got there just after the doors opened around 5:15pm on a Saturday. There were a few people there, but plenty of open seats. We were given a tour of the kitchen area and not only shown the fresh fish on display, but also educated on them as well. We got to meet all the chefs including the executive chef. The whole experience just felt welcoming. Our waiter Darrell was incredibly attentive and personable. Anything we may have needed was addressed immediately. Although Briquette is a higher priced dining experience, I feel that based on the quality of food and service received, it was worth it. My only regret is that I should have worn a polo shirt. Not that anyone said or alluded to it, but I felt I should have dressed more business casual. Regardless, my wife and I had a great time and left full and happy. Our food that we ordered was: Caramelized Sea Scallops with a delicious fried goat cheese grit base (my favorite), Louisiana Redfish on the Half Shell, and Snapper Pontchartrain (which was our favorite entree). You can't go wrong with any of those items. Well done Briquette!",

We were also quite underdressed (shorts, shirts and sweatpants) but were openly welcomed. I very much appreciate the service and my visit there.

I do have to say that the service and atmosphere were excellent but, the food.... terrible. For our appetizer we order the scallops on goat cheese grit cake. The scallops were okay and the grit cake had no goat cheese flavor and was hard as a brick. For the mains we ordered the visiting fish (triple tail) and the ribeye steak medium rare. Well, the fish was covered in a sauce that was greasy and unappetizing. The fish itself was undercooked and flavorless. Some old guy came over to the table (I assume he was the manager) and asked how it was and we told him about it. So, he grabbed the silverware and started cutting into the fish saying,\"you'd enjoy it more if you knew how to eat it\" and proceeded to shred the fish to pieces??? Weird and demeaning experience. I am from Florida. I know how to eat fish! Anyways, the steak was medium well to well and was supposed to be garlic and rosemary crusted. NOPE! Tasted like a boiled steak. Terrible. They offered to precook it but honestly I was so turned off by this point I didn't want to wait another hour for another flavorless steak. They offered dessert instead but we declined. Then they offered to take my one glass of wine off the bill. Which they didn't! How about you take the whole dinner off since we didn't eat it? $164.00 later (not including the tip) we went home and I got sick. Fabulous. This was the WORST dining experience I have ever had.",

The gentleman that opens the door for everyone, everyone except us, coming to and leaving came up to my brother in law and said to take his hat off. He came out of nowhere on the street and we didn't know he even worked there...he was rude about it.  We ordered the Caramelized Sea Scallops, Steamed Prince Edward Mussels, Lump Crab Bisque, and Ahi Poke for starters.  The ONLY good thing out of those were the mussels...even though there were 4 bad tasting ones. The sea scallops were foul I had to walk to the bathroom to spit it out. Crab bisque was not good...it was bright yellow I assume from curry and tasted so bad. For our meals were Speckled Trout Almondine, Pork Porterhouse, and the District Tournedos. The Pork porterhouse was supposed to be cooked medium it was way overcooked...hard and dry. Our other entrees at the table were good. The District Tournedos were delicious and cooked to oerfection as well as the trout almondine. I also ordered a mixed drink of the specialties menu supposed to be coconut, melon, lime, and oj. But instead it tasted like a 12.00 Screwdriver. Had family at next table. Both the meals were horrible they got the Visiting Market Whole fish and the Ribeye. The triple tail whole fish had a very fishy oily taste. The ribeye was supposed to be medium and was far beyond medium past even well. The only star was Daniel our waiter I felt so bad we had to complain to him none of this was his fault. Sad that I had looked forward to this meal and that it is a beautiful space and the experience is horrible. Now we leave town tomorrow and this is the experience we end our trip with...",

The food took over 1 hour to come to us. When the very friendly waiter brought us are food we told him it was wrong. He apologized and walked away. When we got our bill it was $75.00. There was even a beer on our ticket that we did not order. After letting the gm manager now he told us there was nothing he could do. This place is unorganized and will up your ticket. Not a good place for big groups. Even with a reservation and no one else in the restaurant. When we finished it took over 1 hour to get us our bill. Bad management!",

A palatable wine list for both the novice and connoisseur at one's fingertips before the conversation ever begins. To the food...The turtle soup that my husband ordered was so good that I forgot to take a pic. However I did get snaps of his redfish (pan fried to perfection) and my duck.  You won't find a bone in-skin intact duck shank anywhere else to my knowledge. Look at the photo...the skin is crispy and flavorful. Meat is moist and not too gamey. Side note...I could've made a meal of the Swiss chard and pork belly plantain mash that were three sides of the dish. Everything about dinner was completely satisfying and left us full. But then....  I had to ask about dessert. Of course. And so,  the pies de resistance was the \"floating island\" meringue cake. To clarify, this is not a cake made of batter. It is a finely and acutely rendered meringue confection that looks exactly like a piece of cake, but it's all meringue, so it completely melts in your mouth. Be sure to add a piece of the housemade caramel crackle candy and anglaise to each bite. It is rare to find this delicacy, even in France. My mom used to say there's always room for jello. Well, jello feels like concrete compared to the island. JUST. GET. IT. With a glass of prosecco, of course! ;-)  Kat (or maybe Cat), our server, was always on time without encroaching. Visiting with GM Nic was a treat. You can tell that he holds his title, and the responsibilities that come with it, close to his chest. Hopefully you'll get the chance to visit with him a bit and hear a story.",

Chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was great too though on a heavy, chocolate-mousse side.  The negative experience came unexpectedly, when I had to suppress a gag reflex when trying to eat the mussels. They smelled a bit...\u201dpoop-y\u201d. Mussels have to be stored in proper drainage and then rinsed before being served, otherwise they end up marinating in their own excrement.  We let Tess know the mussels weren\u2019t safe to eat, we haven\u2019t touched them but did consume all the fries on the bottom (which were sooo good).  We saw Tess dutifully informing chef. We saw the same mussels being served to other table. We then saw mussels on our bill.  Spoiled shellfish is no-joke, someone could get very sick. Making someone pay for spoiled food they didn\u2019t eat?.. come on, chef of Briquette, no way your restaurant is doing that bad.",

The Ahi with roast potatoes and green beans was excellent. The blackened shrimp cajun pasta was good, but not to my taste. The macaroni looked like vesuvio, a thick, short corkscrew pasta. Not good with the sauce. And the sauce was more like a broth thickened with corn starch than it was a cream sauce. The shrimp certainly wasn't blackened. It had spinach and mushrooms. So it was fancy and different and I know many people would like it. But not me. I added a ton of cajun seasoning and salt.  Service was slow. In fairness, there were 8 tables handled by 1 waiter, but the place looked empty. 3 singles, 3 couples a table of 5 and a table of 6. Had to keep asking for things the waiter forgot when asked (like cajun spice). Worth going to though and they change the menu. So what you see online probably won't be what they are serving when you go.",

My wife and I were hosting two out of town guests from California and selected Briquette because of its reviews on Google.  I have never been so disappointed in the food preparation in a New Orleans restaurant, as was at this place.  Four main courses, and 4 starters many of which were different but all were barely eatable.  I had Halibut; it is a challenge to ruin Halibut, but this restaurant managed to accomplish this feat.  In addition, the pairing of the side dishes to the Halibut was atrocious.  Based upon the food, this place deserves a one star rating; I rated it two stars because the service was reasonable.",

The menu was unimaginative and seemed to be trying too hard to be \"gourmet.\" Decent wine list, though.  We arrived late on the Saturday before the SAINTS big playoff game and the staff was spent. The hostess tried to turn us away because we didn't have reservations. We asked if we could wait and she said nothing would be available until 9:30 (it was about 9:10 at the time). We were posturing to leave when the manager swooped in and had us seated immediately. Our server was pleasant enough but looked exhausted and going through the motions. Overall, a very unremarkable dining experience.",

Get the whole fish, if you dont mind doing a bit of de-boning work, as you get much more meat for a lower price than with the fillet dinner.  Dessert: their Cloud Cake is a merengue type of soft, slightly chewy cake that is definitely an experience! I have never had a cake like this, and it was pleasantly light, with a slight sweet citrus to it.  Ambiance is beautifully private and attention is paid to many details, such as wiping down the wine cooler glass when it gets to foggy.",

The waitress was not particularly pleasant. She toppled a tray of drinks,  breaking glass all over the tray. She served the remaining drinks,  so we sent them back because there was no way to know if broken glass was in the drinks. After that, service went way downhill. At the end, she kept saying we hadn't paid enough, but we had, she just wasn't entering it correctly in the system. She came back three times accusing us of underpaying. We kept adding it up for her. Finally we had to call the manager. They finally figured out that she wasn't pushing a button on the register to add one of the cards (which had been ran, so payment was made). It was really ridiculous. This was a bad end to an otherwise nice meal. The bar menu was not great, and er didn't love the drinks, but the food was really good. It's a shame the service ruined it.",

The oysters were tiny and smothered with bland creamed spinach. Definitely not worth eating. My husband ordered the crab cake which was described as having lump crab meat, but was basically a thin layer of shredded  crab between 2 layers of soggy, gloppy breading. My grilled snapper was okay, but a  bit dry.  When we arrived, we were the only table. Our server had several others once our food arrived and didn't check on us until we were finished. When he finally asked how our food was when we paid, they only gave us 10% off. Gee, thanks. I waited tables years ago and nothing about this was okay. We'll definitely go back to Peche next time instead.",
