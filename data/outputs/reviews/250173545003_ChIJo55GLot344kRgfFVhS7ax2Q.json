One of the dishes literally has 5 chunk of potatoes and one chunk of tomato in some gravy sauce. Maybe 3 pieces of onions and stuff, nothing else ( I think this is Kentang Gulai Kurma). I feel like the restaurant put in whatever cheap ingredients into the dishes and call it a meal. The other dish is some street noodle and 90% of it is just... noodles. I really don't think the food is nearly worth the price.  I can't even imagine eating this again for a dinner even if someone pays me! :/",

This restaurant is somewhat new, so I thought that I would try it out. Boy, I'm glad I did because it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I was born in Cambodia and the moment I step foot into the restaurant, it reminds me immediately of sitting in a Cambodian restaurant in the middle of Phnom Penh. The servers were courteous and extremely helpful with the extensive menu. They have a street food menu that composts of noodles and rice dishes. I wanted to specifically try the nasi lamak and noodle in curry sauce. Unfortunately, they didn't have anymore nasi lamak, but the substitute Hainese chicken dish was a great sub for it. The noodle dish was delicious. Noodle was soft but not mushy. The curry broth that the noodle sits in was thick and super flavorful! it was creamy and pack full of nostalgic aromas. The combo of land meat and seafood is a classic for Southeast Asian food, so I'm glad they stuck with it. The Hainese chicken, though not the best i've had, was a strong contender. The chicken was tender, juicy, and heavily seasoned. That's what chicken needs is to be heavily seasoned. The dipping sauce was fragrant and pack a punch. The soup that accompanies the rice dish is mild yet refreshing, a perfect and classic partner for SouthEast version of rice and meat.  We also got the fried red snapper and 3 flavor sauce. The fish was fried to perfection. Yes, it is the whole entire fish. It was crispy and crunchy and crackily and just pure awesome. Really stroke my Asian-ness. Yes, the head comes on it too. The sauce that comes on top of the fish is AMAZING!!!! ton of fish sauce aka natural MSG aka umami bomb aka the shindig. Their entree really made to be eaten with jasmine rice which are sold by person and not by portion. You pay $2 for unlimited jasmine rice. They come to your table in a shiny round vessels which brings me back to Cambodia. Just classic.  The scallops appetizer seems pricey but well worth the price for the single bite. The scallops are seared resulting in a dark, caramelized flavor, then the shredded duck along with the fish sauce base sauce compliments the delicate flavor of the scallops. topped off with some refreshing sliced scallion. YUM!  Lastly, roasted duck salad. Nothing to laugh about. The duck was tender and flavorful. The rest of the salad is pretty classic Southeast Asian salad consisting of hearty crunchy cabbage and herbs. The dressing is sweet with the a strong salt that really brings out the brightness of the duck. While the dressing is strong, the duck is still the star flavor of the dish.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're an adventurous eater and veterans of Vietnamese food. They have a combination of Southeast Asia - Vietnamese, Khmer, Thai, Chinese flavors. Not too punchy but just enough to leave wanting more and more. Looking forward to going back soon.",

        "caption": "Food I decided to come here because of the great ratings in Yelp, but I was disappointed. The food was very mediocre. The highlight was the scallop appetiser, but still not perfect. The chicken betel leaf was interesting, but I didn\u2019t realise it was a cold dish. The steam snapper dumplings were okay as well. For main course, I had the crispy whole fish and it was so sweet that I couldn\u2019t finish half of it. The red duck curry was not bad. Finally, the desserts. Both of us had black sticky rice. Not a fan.  Everything else The decor was nice, but a bit too dark for my taste. I don\u2019t think the restaurant is doing very well. We came here on a Friday night and there were only four tables, and there were not many takeouts. I definitely will not come back and don\u2019t recommend it to anyone.",

The decorations, plates and even the water jars were so authentic and elegant! For desert I tried cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e with almond ice cream ($8) and it was just as good as the food! I didn\u2019t try the starters or sides, but they sounds delicious! Nice place to dine with family and friends. Also super friendly staff. Will definitely go back there soon.

The Bornean Adam Tahu comes highly recommended: it is the right amount of sweet and spicy.  The dessert selection is pretty good too: we had the banana cake with coconut ice cream and we could have had 20 of those. There are a few beer options (besides Singha) and a rather extensive wine collection. The decor is stunning: the mural is very eye catching of course, but there are a lot of quirky little details (like the tiffin boxes on the wall and the newspaper wallpaper in the bathroom). If you want to bring a large group, make sure you book well in advance and the place is pretty cozy.",

Although this is a not a low-budget choice along a (happily rejuvenated) stretch of good options, it may be among the best of them. 4 of us enjoyed 3 appetizers, 4 main dishes, a delicious take on banana bread, a fine Vietnamese coffee, and a bottle of wine for $176 including tip. I'd advocate for a broader beer selection (though I don't drink beer much), and some by the glass wine selection. Tidy portions, richly flavored. We'll be back!",

My husband and I were looking for a place to eat last night and we were invited into restaurant by two of their staff members who told us about their 'soft opening'. So glad we gave them a try. The service was beyond excellent, the atmosphere was great and food was delicious. The chef supposedly was really famous in Bali and moved here to open up a restaurant. The menu is unique and everything we tried was so flavorful. We got a free starter, scallops that were so so good. We then ordered two types is curry, one duck, one lamb and both were amazing. For desert we had coconut ice cream and a pudding. Thank you Chalawan for a great dinner, we will be back!! So excited about this new Asian restaurant in our neighborhood, just what was missing.",
