I had a billing issue with one of Uber Eats drivers suddenly canceling my order at the last minute while I was still being charged for the order. I called this restaurant and John, the owner, spoke to me and was very patient and professional. John and his employees went above and beyond to assist me with my issue.  In today's age where many businesses treat you more like a number instead of a human being, it's only right that I commend them for excellent customer service.",

I am giving Johnny Kaks two stars because I've gotten sick (stomach pains and vomiting) on more than one occasion after eating their food. Also there was a case where I was overcharged for a meal I usually would pay eight bucks and change for. The lady at the front informed me that their prices had gone up, about two weeks later I ordered the same meal and was charged the regular eight dollars and change I had always paid, I guess everyone has their own prices.",
