Pleasant from Takoma, and I have been very disappointed with trying to find a bar with a great draft list in walking distance. Thirsty Crow is a top contender to meet those criteria. Great draft list and very knowledgeable bar tenders. Vibes are really good once you get past the creepy entrance down the staircase. Did not have food, but it looks delicious. Thank you great beer list, I will be back.",

There are no words for how good the flavor is you just gotta eat it and experience the power yourself 8) There's a really nice charred flavor the kind that comes from a good wok frying :D The Chinese sausage was the cherry on top, mixed in with the noodles and shrimp each bite was phenomenal! Noodles are soft and chewy but not mushy 10/10 good mouthfeel. Had me wishing the plate was bigger so I could eat MOREEE  Nasi Lemak (chicken confit) Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside just the way it should be! Pulls apart pretty easily too so it's easy to eat. Chicken has a pretty good flavor alone but the Best part of the dish has gotta be the SAMBAL!!! I want to take jars of the sauce home with me \ud83e\udd24 It has a slight kick to it and is soooooo good I could put it over all the other dishes \ud83d\ude02 You can't tell from the photos but the rice is a super fragrant coconut pandan rice! Smells and tastes so nice. The anchovies on the side are super crunchy and add a really nice texture and flavor to the dish. Especially when u eat them with....THE SAMBAL  Wok Fried Celtuce Had no idea what celtuce was but am glad we decided to get it! Was super fresh and had a nice cromch to it while simultaneously being kinda soft. Hard to describe but highly recommend! The sauce was delicious as well poured it over my leftover rice heh. It's topped with some crunchy garlic chips which added a nice contrast to the overall dish.  Chicken satay You can't go wrong with chicken satay! Peanut sauce is thick goodness and the chicken was perfectly cooked and juicyyyy Pro tip dip the chicken in the sambal ;)  Atmosphere is very chill and the employees are very friendly :) There are a bunch of tvs, pool tables and darts making this a good place to chill with a beer on top of the fantastic food!  If I lived nearby would definitely become a regular but at the very least I will 100% be coming back here to try the rest of the menu! It's worth the hour long metro from VA LOL. They are also about to open a malay restaurant upstairs can't wait to try that out as well! \ud83e\udd70",

        "caption": "After reading about the spot, I knew to keep expectations in check - it's not fair to hold it to Village Park standards. Moreover, despite having always eaten a wide variety of Asian cuisines, I've become much more discerning of Malaysian food in the last few years after my S.O.'s 2-year grad school stint there. So, when we saw that a full service Malaysian restaurant, Makan, would be opening soon and they were beta testing menu items at their subterranean counterpart bar, Thirsty Crow, I had to try it.  If the bar's limited menu is any indication of what the food will be like at the full service restaurant upstairs, there is cause for concern. One can overlook the fork and knife, no spoon, but the food? I ordered the char kwey teow and nasi lemak ayam goreng (though they didn't really know what ayam goreng was). The char kwey teow was relatively tasty but the wide noodle and wetter texture was a clear lean toward the Thai dishes Americans are used to (think drunken noodles). The other dish was where things got tragic. At first, I thought that they'd accidentally served me plain white rice instead of nasi lemak, but it turns out that their version was just completely lacking in flavor and olfactory appeal. The ayam goreng, or what the server called confit chicken, had none of the wonderful essence of Malaysia and left me wanting not one bite more in disappointment. Their sambal was watery and also flavor-lite, tossed haphazardly over the rice and plate. The ikan bilis (dried anchovies) were ok, but I missed the skin-on flavor of the peanuts from overseas. Nasi lemak ayam goreng in Malaysia is some of the best fried chicken I've had anywhere on the planet - a fragrant, flavor-packed joy to eat. This attempt was woefully lacking. We'll be back to try Makan, but we're not impressed by this showing. At all.",
