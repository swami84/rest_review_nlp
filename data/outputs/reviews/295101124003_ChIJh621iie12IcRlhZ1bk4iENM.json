I was slightly (very slightly) disappointed in the sashimi in the bowl and I only say this because my usual sushi restaurant takes very good care of me  and likely adds a little extra. That said, it was more than filling especially with the amount of rice. I also had a sumo roll and a premium Sapporo.

        "caption": "I have lived in CWE for two years and had never been to Sushi Koi until recently. I usually opt for Kampai or Sub Zero, but after my experience here I will make this my regular sushi stop. Not only was the restaurant atmosphere clean and sleek, but the food and service were great! The price of sushi here is much lower than other places nearby and the same, if not better, quality. Our waiter was really nice, but our food took a while to come out. Because of this, he offered us complementary dumplings, which was so great! I believe our waiter's name was Ryan, but am not completely sure. Whoever he was, he was very friendly, accommodating and hardworking. We truly enjoyed our experience here and will be back.",

Before coming to St Louis for school, I waitressed at multiple sushi restaurants and have eaten at dozens of sushi restaurants from California to Boston; this little cozy place is easily the best. The fish here is always fresh and available for very reasonable prices. Having worked at other places, I know that a lot of sushi restaurants will often skimp on the fish in the lunch/happy hour rolls but at Koi, they\u2019re always super generous with their cuts. Yes, there may only be one sushi chef (the owner) so it might not be great for large parties, but the chef really does put her heart into every cut of fish and roll. I think there was a week where I ate here for lunch almost every day... Staff always does a great job!",

The Hamachi roll (2nd picture) is a big portion which is reflected in the price. Not complicated in flavors, but a joy to eat. Service was great and very up front about their toro (where others try to pass chu-toro as o-toro or not even know what toro is even if it's on their menu). Sushi chef was very nice as well.

The takoyaki was crispy on the outside, and warm and gooey once I bit into it, and they did not skimp on the squid. Most sushi joints here don't even have it on the menu, but Sushi Koi just nails it. The chirashi don - I haven't had raw fish this good in St Louis. The temperature of the fish was room temperature. It melted in my mouth like butter. I was sad toward the end of my meal because I realized that once I had a certain piece, I couldn't have it again. It was that good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place to anyone that loves quality sushi.",

Surprisingly, the line shortened rather quickly and we got in within minutes. I ordered the Extra Special Cheshire Bowl. It came with a bowl of miso soup, which was perfect in the cold weather. A few minutes later, the waiter brought the main course over. The Hashim were thick and tasted fresh several pieces simply melted in my mouth. The tam ago was a tad sweet, but otherwise was pretty good. The sushi rice was perfect--at the right grainy texture with the right amount of sushi vinegar. $29 still felt a bit expensive, but it was certainly worth it the first time.",
