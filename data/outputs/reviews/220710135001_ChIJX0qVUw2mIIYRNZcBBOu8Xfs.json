Service was atrocious, had to wave down other people for drinks, our server was nowhere to be found. Appetizer came after the entree, no apologies from anyone.. just disastrous all around.

For the rest I can say the following. 1. It took 3 hours to dine and it was not a wedding ... really too slow ... 2. One of the diners found a smelly oyster in his dish (and inadvertently consumed). 3. My Ribeye was hard, cold, served on a cold plate and really badly presented ... served with a twig that seemed to have been put there by a gardener rather than a cook. 4. The berries that, for the record took a quarter of an hour to be served, were a pittance in terms of quantity and presentation. The other people were not happy either. I met Morton's in New York many years ago and, then, I was impressed by the quality of the food. Lately though, the Morton's that I've tried in other cities have disappointed me ... much better Ruth Chris just to mention a similar chain.  (Original) Ho cenato per lavoro in una sala privata. Il posto \u00e9 elegante e la persona che ci ha servito \u00e9 stata molto cordiale. Queste sono le uniche note positive. Per il resto posso dire quanto segue. 1. Ci sono volute 3 ore per cenare e non era un matrimonio...veramente troppo lenti...2. Uno dei commensali ha trovato nel suo piatto (ed inavvertitamente consumato) un'ostrica maleodorante. 3. La mia Ribeye era dura, fredda, servita su un piatto freddo e veramente mal presentata...impiattata insieme a un rametto che sembrava esser stato messo l\u00ec da un giardiniere piuttosto che da un cuoco. 4. I frutti di bosco che, per la cronaca hanno richiesto un quarto d'ora per essere serviti, erano una miseria in termini di quantit\u00e0 e di presentazione. Anche le altre persone non sono rimaste contente. Ho conosciuto Morton's a New York tanti anni fa e, allora, sono rimasto colpito dalla qualit\u00e0 del cibo. Ultimamente per\u00f2, i Morton's che ho provato in altre citt\u00e0, mi hanno deluso...molto meglio Ruth Chris giusto per menzionare una catena simile.",

The drinks were made to order and our oysters were good, this is where things went downhill.  2 minutes after our oysters (order as an appetizer) arrived our dinner and 2 sides arrived, a total of  6 plates arrive all at once just for dinner. It was utter chaos. The baked potato we asked to split was not split, I had to separate the pieces onto different plates and then fillings were tossed on top carelessly (it literally made a mess), our steaks were half over done and half cooked to order, the scallops completely over done and we should have been told our dinner came with asparagus so we hadn\u2019t ordered a side of asparagus. We were starving, literally the only meal of the day after working a conference, so we ate most of it out of pure hunger and knowing how much this all cost. When confronted about the very poor timing and food, the bartender (who served the food) didn\u2019t care less. Poor fr, poor food, poor delivery. We will never visit another Morton\u2019s no matter where it is.",

Well it came broiled with the crispy top. The manager (Derek) was at the table when I asked the server why it was broiled? Once he saw that I wasn\u2019t happy he left the table... this was very weird. I have never had a manager leave a server when they see an issue. My server Kale was very helpful she didn\u2019t know or understand why it was broiled. She came back and told me the cook did steam my lobster then he broiled it for color. At this point the manager(Derek) still didn\u2019t come back to the table to check on me. The server asked if she could have the cook make it again. I asked if he could just not put it in the broiler because I don\u2019t like the tough top. She brought me a new lobster meal, it was cut up into four pieces. The manager(Derek) came by this time. I asked him why was the lobster cut into pieces. Derek told me that\u2019s how I wanted it steamed, right? I said no. I wanted a nice lobster tail not tough lobster pieces. I pulled a piece out of the shell and asked him if he thought it was over cooked and he said he didn\u2019t know how it was suppose to look. I still can\u2019t get over the fact that Derek thought it was ok for the cook to cut up my lobster into four pieces!!! What kind of manager is this guy! Why is he at Morton\u2019s? Derek was the worst manager ever. No restaurant should cut up your lobster into four pieces. I am disappointed and Morton should be ashamed. It was the worst meal and the service from Derek was even worst. Thank you Kale for trying to make our evening a good experience! Again, Derek was the worst and Morton\u2019s should know that Derek is a bad representation of the restaurant.",

However $225 for one dinner was my entire weeks grocery budget at home. Visiting this restaurant was on my bucket list, now it is checked off and will not be repeated at these prices. Most people are wearing work attire, or casual elegant. Some people do wear jeans and T-shirts, but it is lightly frowned upon. Coming to NOLA where everything is casual and during Mardi Gras, me nor my husband packed anything but cargo pants and jeans, he wore those. But when we entered the Steakhouse, we saw others in clothes a lot more casual than that! Being a \"tourist city\" I don't think they enforce a dress code.",

(The one in Biloxi is AMAZING!!) 3 adults, 3 teens.. ordered bottles of wine, lots of appetizers and then everyone ordered steak. There was one steak.. the 42oz that was cooked perfectly. My aunt small steak which was ordered medium well came out still mooing!! It was taken back 2 times and still couldn\u2019t cook it correctly. She ended up boxing the steak and took home to finish cooking herself. The medium wells and well done were so dry we couldn\u2019t chew. I was so furious that a upscale steakhouse has ONE job to be able to cook a good juicy steak!!! Our bill was no kidding $1000! It was supposed to be a special dinner. It was nothing but that!! The worse part is THEY WERENT EVEN PACKED!! This whole time while dining between us ladies having to borrow rolls of toilet tissue because after bringing up that it needs ATTENTION.. they just propped the roll instead of actually on dispenser. Keep in mind some stalls were disgusting so rolls were taken out of those and brought in others! Every time someone had use the facility u had check stalls track down those TWO ROLLS! Last time I just brought napkins I\u2019d given up. Ofcourse management new, Ofcourse waiter knew and even though he knows he forgot us and our refills all night he was still tipped properly. As we are exiting the bottle of wine was not properly packaged and my husband took 3 steps with it and went thru bag shattering!!! Manager comes back again.. i calmly (almost tearing) informed him I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED nothing even close to this and I will NEVER VISIT THIS LOCATION. He gave me every excuse about public trash stalls and they were too busy, they had grave yard crew, excuse for EVERYTHING. I fired back if that was busy for them then they wouldn\u2019t make it at other competitors near them!! I left their was 3 small tables!  3 hours in this restaurant. They should\u2019ve declined my phone request for a reservation if they could not give the best possible experience. I feel like I paid for it!! I wrote a note also on my long receipt asking for another manager to call.. plus my email.. AND RADIO SILENCE. If they were the last upscale restaurant to go to.. I would consider BURGER KING!  Shame on Management for thinking it\u2019s ok to service in that manner and expect us to pay too service price.",

The brussel sprouts and pommes frites were cooked very well with tangy sauteed onions, and were quite tasty.  I felt quite important when asked if I would my bottle of water to be sparkling or \"still. That is, until I saw that my still water was $6.50 for a bottle.  The general manager asked me how everything was, even though he saw that my food had just touched down on the table, and that I didn't even have my napkin in place, and so I could not have even taken one single bite of anything. But he was very friendly, engaging, and attentive, the rest of the night. So although I did take notice of all of that, I did let that one pass.  The two women at the front were absolutely engaging, friendly, respectful, and efficient. One took my reservation, the other seated me, and joked back with me, when I engaged her.  Both those women, and the bussers that were clearing the table had courtesy that could teach the wait staff a thing or two.  Despite the great taste of my water, glass of Riesling wine, and three side dishes, I took a rude awakening at the $73.00 tab.  I paid the distant waiter a generous 20%+ tip, paid the bill, and walked out determined to never, ever do this again.",

Not sure if it was because it was a big group of us (25) and it was only him and another guy handling our tables, but the hospitality was NOT there. The appetizers took almost an hour to come out after waiting from 7:15 pm until close to 9pm and then I ordered the Morton salad add chicken and when that came out at almost 10 pm it was similiar to a ceasar salad and when I asked what type of salad this was they didn't even know because it was just that substandard so I told them I did not order that type of salad, I was not offered to maybe order something else. It was just total chaos. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and one glass of Moscato and our bill was $98 but for what?! horrible service, wrong food? and no one not even Arthur who said he was the manager was not very accomodating. I will never ever recommend any of my friends or family to this place again after we spent close to $3000 as a group and nothing that was served was the worth the money or the 4 hours we spent waiting for it. total disappointment",

While waiting on my meal, my entertainment for the evening was watching the cook play on his phone the entire time I was there.  One can only assume he was attempting the latest high score or keeping his many Facebook followers up to date on his latest culinary disaster.  The waiter was attentive at first, but after the main course was served he was harder to locate than Waldo!  Someone, I can only assume was the manager because they never introduced themselves, asked how the meal was.  My coworker was able to answer but I mid bite, and raised with good manners, was unable to respond.  The ability of staff to vanish at this restaurant is astounding as the manager vanished just as quickly as the waiter.  If you care about good steaks cooked right, and staff that do their jobs you are better off finding another steakhouse.  Morton\u2019s at 6:30pm is not busy there was no reason any of this should of happened other than staff that simply don\u2019t care.  If they don\u2019t than you really should take your business to better steakhouses in New Orleans.",

The manager removed items that were received cold, Nicole never aplogized,  and my friends and I lost a lot of valuable time.  My suggestions to the leadership team: coach servers to be more accomdating to guest; instruct servers to apologize when warranted; give seasoned servers large parties; do not book large parties if you don't have adequate kitchen and server staff; parties of 20 should have at least one dedicated server; remove gratuity when service does not meet guest expectations.
