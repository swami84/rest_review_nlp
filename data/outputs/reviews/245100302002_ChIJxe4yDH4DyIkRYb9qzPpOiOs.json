We both got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken for dinner. I rarely finish an entire pasta dish, but this one just wouldn\u2019t let me walk away.

There is a bocce ball court in the restaurant but this doesn't take away from the high end dining experience.  I had some friends from Boston in the area and they asked me what the best Italian place was; I told them La Scala.  After eating there they said it was the best they have had anywhere.  This place is amazing.  They also do catering which lives up to their standards.  I could not recommend a place any more than La Scala.  It is truly a gem in Baltimore.  Their wait staff is also top notch, some of the best in the business.  Be careful with the post dinner limoncello!  :) You must try this place if you ever have the chance!",

The service was professional with an accurate description of all the night\u2019s specials and with kind assistance by the waiter in selecting our wine. The wine we selected was not available so the waiter suggested a very acceptable replacement.  The wait for the food was reasonable, as all three orders had to be prepared from scratch. The food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Water and wine glasses were refilled without any sense of intrusion. During our time here, the place was full and we had our conversation at a normal level. The chef came around to our table near the end to inquire about the meal and we replied that it was fantastic.  I would gladly come here again.",

The staff from the front of the house to the back of the house were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The chef and the manager stopped by the table to ask how the meals were being enjoyed. Though the chef could have taken all the credit he made it clear that the \u201cteam\u201d is what made the meals so fantastic.  2.  Delia (I think that\u2019s how you spell her name, if not please forgive me)... Anyway she was fantastic, we absolutely loved her sense of humor and her honesty when it came to making recommendations (none of which were less than AMAZING).  We never asked for anything more than once, if at all. She was on point with watching our drinks and when we were done with our plates etc.  3. I had the veal special and my date had the fish special (whole fish) I cannot remember the specific type. The veal was SOOO tender, which they describe as fall off of the bone... NO... more like so tender it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s a solid. The flavors that were put together and the pasta were just to die for. My date\u2019s fish was nicely presented (head and all) and our wonderful waitress filleted it for us table side (and did an excellent job). Oh and of course tasted amazing as well.  4.  Everything from the house bread to the specialty drinks were made with deep thought, intent and knowledge of how to make your taste buds dance.  I left there so full but I couldn\u2019t fathom having any extras to take home and We immediately wanted to turn around and go right back in to try something different. We haven\u2019t been able to talk about anything else all night and will be back within the next few days to try the dishes we picked as our second choices.  5.  Without a doubt I can say that this was the best meal and service I\u2019ve ever had in a restaurant. My date is from Italy and says that there has never been a restaurant in the US that has impressed.. until now. With that being said the prices are extremely reasonable and I would recommend this place to ANYONE who wants delish Italian and great service. I mean honestly ask yourself how many places you have been where the chef and the manager came by to see how you enjoyed the meal without a problem? I could count them on one hand.  Thank you La Scala! See you again in a few days!",

Both were outstanding and flavors were out of this world. Would definitely recommend both. I was brought tiramisu for a birthday dessert and my wife got the nutella crepe with strawberries.

They were at the restaurant on the day Nino got his US citizenship, and he always remembers us with a smile. I am vegan, and he never fails to make me a delicious, off-menu mushroom and asparagus risotto with marsala wine. Sometimes I switch it up with a custom spaghetti con fungi, sans-dairy. My brother LOVES the shrimp toast. Before you even order you are greeted with a small plate of cold green beans and potatoes, and honestly that could be my whole meal.

The wine selection is terrific if on the higher price side. We selected a lovely, lighter Sicilian red that had mineral notes reflecting the volcanic soil there. The restaurant has fantastic service all around. I had noted that it was our anniversary when i made the reservation online, and we were surprised by a congratulations card from management and a complimentary tiramisu for dessert. Before dessert we played boccie on the indoor court. Fabulous! We will go back.",

But don't let the classic feel fool you. La Scala is anything but stuffy. The menu includes modern twists on Italian classics and the servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to offer their suggestions and answer questions. In addition to their sizable printed menu, there are numerous creative and enticing specials every evening. La Scala also offers a fantastic Happy Hour at the bar, including discounted appetizers and cocktails. You can't go wrong with this spot, whether it's for a romantic evening out or a fun get together with friends. I've loved everything I've ever had to eat and drink here, but the Vitello Saltimbocca Alla Romana (veal topped with mozzarella, prosciutto, sage, and cognac sauce) is a personal favorite. If the Osso Bucco is one of the specials, don't pass it up. La Scala also has phenomenal Espresso Martinis, which make a great substitute for dessert if you are too stuffed for one of their delicious sweet options.",

I grew up in philly so I know good Italian food when I taste it and after 3 attempts at a decent Italian restaurant, I regained hope with this place. The meat and cheese platters were out of this world. The meats were velvety and melt in your mouth. The bread and string beans were a nice touch. And it just kept getting better with the main course. You can\u2019t go wrong with anything on the menu. For  dessert, we got the cream puff and the tiramisu and it was just perfect. The only opportunity area I would give this place is the ice cream selection. The only flavor they had was pistachio and as someone that is allergic to nuts, I would have liked to see a few other flavors. But everything else was out of this world. If you\u2019re looking for a good Italian meal with a relaxed and clean atmospher for a special occasion, I recommend La Scala. Don\u2019t waste your time anywhere else!",

We've gone many times for dinner on Sunday afternoon/early evening - they have a great small plates menu at the bar on Sundays which used to be a very nice experience and opportunity to try several different dishes and creative drinks - as well as a nice/friendly service experience. Not this time - we went two weeks ago and every dish we had was just plain bad. The calamari was tough & flavorless, and the \"marinara\" sauce served with it was literally watery and bland - we thought that the sauce was a mistake bc we've eaten there MANY times and always had great marinara - so we asked to please have some marinara sauce, and the bartender said that that WAS the marinara. Are you kidding me?? This is one of the top restaurants in the city and the marinara sauce literally was a bland light reddish watery broth consistency with little sign of tomatoes - and zero flavor. We tried another plate suggested by the bartender and were told it was on the happy hour menu - it was bland and room temperature, and to top it off when we got the bill it was $16 for a tiny bit of flavorless food - instead of the happy hour price as were were told. On top of this, the mixed drinks were bad bc the tonic and soda had no carbonation - and the bartender was not at all friendly as is usually the case when we eat at the bar. Also, there was an odd very loud Hispanic type of music playing in the place which was too loud and just all wrong for the normal ambiance of this restaurant. I have nothing against diverse music but this is an upscale italian restaurant, and it was out of place. Usually when we've had dinner in the bar area on Sundays the owner is there and chats with patrons, and is visibly overseeing things - we've talked to him many times over the years and he's a very nice man. He was not around the day we were there - and you would hate to think that the staff can't function without the owner there, but we wondered if that was the issue. Everything was off - no one was friendly, the food was nasty, and the drinks & service were worse. We were so creeped out that we got the check after a couple small plates and two drinks (we would usually stay at least two hours to eat several plates and try various drinks bc they have creative drink specials on Sundays). We should've complained about the error in price on the one dishes when we got the check - but honestly, we just wanted to get out of there, so we didn't mention it. Either this place is going downhill or the staff can not handle basic operations in the absence of the owners and don't care about the quality of things unless the owner is there. This is hard for us to swallow bc It's been our favorite place til now, and things were so badly off that we don't know if we'll go back. We may give it one more chance though just bc of how long we've been eating here - or we may just give Tagliatta' s a try and see if It's good enough to take Lascala' s place. What a shame. I hope it's just an off day - but honestly even I can make better marinara by light years than what I was served.",

The food was delicious. But, the first cup of coffee was obviously left over from lunch (we arrived at 4 in order miss most of the Mother's Day crunch)...and was barely warm.  It wasn't until after the meal arrived and we responded with a request for an additional cup when staff asked if we needed anything...it was obviously empty.  The table near us was served their desert order and had to request a 'fresh' brewed cup b/c theirs was substandard as well.  The desert was completely consumed before the fresh cup arrived.  When it came, ours was steaming and much better than the first cup.  The meal was hot and delicious but we had to flag staff down for the check.  Highly rated and the food  itself was good but the rest...not so much.",
