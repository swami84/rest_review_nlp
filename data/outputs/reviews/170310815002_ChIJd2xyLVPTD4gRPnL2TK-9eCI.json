When the delivery person arrived to my building he said I have to pay $10 preset tip or else he would leave. I had no choice but forcefully pay the $10 tip! This is not what I expected, it was extortion from a small business. Lesson learned, trust the big companies that have a set few. At least you know what you are paying for",

This caused a backlog which means the people who are in the restaurant had to wait even longer to get their food because of this error. Furthermore the staff was not kind to the GrubHub couriers even though they were just doing their job. One of the couriers had a minor language barrier and instead of explaining the situation in a different manner he just became more frustrated and repeated the same thing.

Called the store, and they said it had been dropped off around 6:50 and the delivery man and my doorman had called me, and they left it at the front desk. The driver didn\u2019t call me, as I had no missed calls around the time the order was said to be delivered. Also, our front desk never called either, and I know that because when I went downstairs to get the food, I asked our doorman if they called to let me know the food arrive, and they said they didn\u2019t, so off the bat there, the delivery man wasn't being truthful. Our doorman told us that the delivery man told them that I had been contacted and would be coming down, so the story the delivery man told Silver Spoon management doesn't add up. The issue was two fold in that the food was cold, and rice sitting out for over and hour by the time we got to the front desk isn't sanitary, and I'm immunocompromised, so would have requested the delivery man come straight to our door. The night of the order, Silver Spoon refused to help and begrudgingly told me they would give me a refund and to go through Chowow, but when ChowNow went to them to confirm the refund, the restaurant refused. They also were incredibly unprofessional, yelling at me on the phone and saying the issue must be on my end, when I initially called to ask about the delivery process.",

Food was Mediocre at best! I was truly disapointed being Asian! I have tasted better food at mall Kiosk's, Pepper steak was watery,and the meat was a few small Shreds of beef ,white in color. Pad thai was also Spartan in meat and ALL noodles, very Dry. Maybe these two dishes do not reflect the Quality of the whole entire menu.....BUT it did for me.......",

I'd suggest making the staff know that you legitimately want some spicy food if that's what you really want.  Just make sure that if you're in a big party that you either make sure they can divvy up your bill when you order or bring cash. We were with a big party (three families) and it took awhile for them to figure out who ordered what when it came time to pay the tab.",

We watched the other couple that sat down after us enjoying their meal while we were ordering.  That's how long this was taking.  We ordered red curry entree and a beef entree.  Portion sizes were small considering other restaurants.  The red curry is listed as bei g spicey, NOT.  The red curry came in a bowl like a soup and was so bland it was like eating milk.  Mini egg rolls were not bad.  Chicken rice soup wasn't bad.  Both entrees were lacking in Thai flavor.   The place is also quite filthy.  They have tiles coming up on the restaurant floor and a badly fix job of other tiles.  Another couple were also complaining about the food while were eating.  There is way to many restaurants close to this one and way better Thai than this one.  I do not recommend this restaurant as a place to even try.  Don't waste your money.  Go to some of the other establishments and spend your good hard earned money.  Worst meal I have had in years.  She also wouldn't give me a breakdown of how she came up with the price.",

Food was authentic, but portions were some of the smallest from any Thai establishment experienced, with the soup having little substance, the rice being dry, and the salad plain. The black pepper on the beef really did it, though. Don't know what was used - would have it again anytime!  The service was noticeably absent. Long times to order, receive food (other tables that ordered after were being served first), lacking drink refills, and having to go up to the wait staff to get the ticket (the table next to ours grabbed the same staff member who brought our ticket to get theirs).  + Authentic food + Best beef spice + Price - Service - Proportions - Time - Seating / Facilities",
