I got a small hot and sour soup and a sesame chicken to go and was incredibly impressed by the portion size. I ended up being full after the soup, because there was so much good stuff in it! The standout items in it which pleasantly surprised me (as you don't tend to find them in hot and sour) were water chestnuts and little bits of chicken. Although I'm saving most of it for leftovers, the sesame chicken is also very good: the sauce is light but incredibly flavorful, and they give you a few pieces of broccoli as well. Overall, I am very impressed and will definitely be coming back!",
