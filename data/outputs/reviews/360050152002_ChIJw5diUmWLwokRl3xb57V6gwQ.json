I walked in at 9:30pm I understand if you\u2019re not seating anymore but at least allow me to order food your kitchen closes at around 10-10:30pm especially since you guys were packed and it\u2019s a weekend you guys would prefer to sell as many meals and drinks as possible to earn more profit. This boosts revenue for the business and can cause a higher tip for employees. But sadly I was denied takeout as well. Never tried this restaurant I live in the area and already a horrible first impression I was going with my Fianc\u00e9 we just got out of work and just wanted to eat after a long 12 hour shift and exhausted didn\u2019t even have to be seated.",

They stated there is no reservation just to come btw 2:30 and 3pm that they\u2019ll sit us in two tables. We arrived to the place, we waited about an hour and then we were told that they could seat all of us but at 5pm. That\u2019s absurd. What kind of customer service is that. I usually don\u2019t post anything but they definitely ruined the moment for my mom and my family. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend this place.",

It was 5 girls including  me being 9 months pregnant. everyone else got their food except for me so I waiting couple mins the server comes to say they don't have yellow rice and that the kitchen \"forgot to make my food.\" At this point we are all over the dam place and just want to leave. Someone came to apologize and offer me a plate but at this point I was beyond upset. My friends all decided to take their food to go because they were also over it. We ended speaking to one of the young men and asked to speak to the manager (we didn't know he was sitting legit next to us) the manager has the nerve to them him to tell us \"they can come talk to me If they want to.\" Uh sir your establishment made the mistake you're sitting 3 feet away and have the audacity to be prideful.

My wife ordered the fried shrimp dish. We were both very satisfied with the food, the garlic dip for the tostones was exceptional. My wife had Happy Hour sangria which she found very good. Parking is either street which I had no problem finding or metered. The restaurant ambiance is totally puertorican which is a nice touch.",

The perfect combination of ingredients.   We had the pi\u00f1a colada, Mojito and margarita. They were all made to perfection.  They used quality ingredients and not too much or too little alcohol.  So now that I got that out the way I want to share my experience; our experience.  Our waitress Elaine and buser Peter were super excellent! They were both very attentive, friendly, professional, knowledgeable, etc. I remember it being a Saturday.  We had a late afternoon/early evening dinner and it was a chilly.  Elaine made her best efforts to keep us as warm as possible while enjoying outdoor dining. She also made great food suggestions.  Thank you for the wonderful service, food and night.  Elaine good luck on your future endeavors.  You\u2019ll make an AWESOME teacher.",
