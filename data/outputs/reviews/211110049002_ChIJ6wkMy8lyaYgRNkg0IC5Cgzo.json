I've been eating her soul food from the time I was a teenager - Baked Chicken, Roast Beef, Collard Greens, Mac'n'Cheese, etc. I'd always look forward to her desserts, like her Caramel Cake and Peach Cobbler. And who can forget her FAMOUS ROLLS - bread so delicious, 'make you wanna slap somebody! The rest of the city began getting a taste of her delicacies when, several years ago, she moved to the 2nd floor of the American Red Cross, where she was open most weekdays for breakfast and lunch. Now, she has moved her restaurant to a larger space on 2nd & Broadway, right in the heart of downtown Louisville. The great news is, it's not too late to get a taste - if you're in Louisville, Kentucky, that is. (Been there 3 times since it opened - wrecked my Keto every time! But it was worth it!) If you're not on any food restrictions, you need to pay the place a visit! Even if you're 2-3 hours from here, it is worth the drive, believe me! Experience God's LOVE & ANOINTING in every meal!",
