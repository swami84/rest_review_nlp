We were met by a rather frantic hostess who tried to get us seated quite quickly. We initially booked the high chairs but opted for seating outside. The ambiance is okay. I suppose it would have been better inside? I was really looking forward to the food after seeing photos online and reading reviews however I have to say that the food was mediocre at best. We had a couple of entrees - octopus and tuna ceviche and then mains - burger. The flavors were nothing to write home about. After getting through the entrees we looked at each other and said: \u201cis this really the 3rd best restaurant in Chicago?!\u201d.  We have eaten at restaurants around the world - London, Paris, Cape Town, Sydney, Rome, etc. The food at this restaurant was just ok and certainly not deserving of 5 stars!",

The texture and flavor of the tlacoyo were definitely there just would\u2019ve like the onions to be a little more crisp. The chilaquiles itself were more of an ok dish but the steak and the pico de gallo that come with it completely made up for it. (This could be due to us preferring fresh made totopos and a much more flavorful spicy salsa). Pleasant atmosphere. Will like to try more of their menu.",

Short Ribs Tacos: short ribs confit, salsa verde, pinto beans, tortillas I thought maybe this dish was wrong because I was expecting Tacos.  The meat was tender and flavorful but the bean and tortilla was make like a patty.  It was filing and tasted good with the salsa.  Arroz con Leche: rice pudding, white chocolate, pink peppercorn ice cream Very sweet. I would not have ordered if not included.   This would be better as a smaller portion or share.",

Mussels: they should better describe what this is in the menu.  The broth is basically just 2 lbs of butter and bacon with white wine. It tastes good,  but definitely too much butter. Guac was pretty good nothing spectacular. Mahi Mahi was good, side of mashed potatoes also good,  but again the sauce they provided was pure butter. Overall,  I'd prefer more heat/spice, less butter and more citrus. Maybe i just ordered the wrong food.   I went the seafood route.  Service 4 stars: Server was great, very attentive, paid attention to dietary restrictions. Busers also great. Hostess was very rude. Lead us to a seat we did not like due to high traffic and politely asked to change it before we even sat down. There were a ton of open seats at the time,  and she made it a big deal. Started us off on the wrong foot.  Price $$$: I get it,  it's river north,  but just thought it was very pricey across the board for what you're getting.  Ambiance 5 stars: Did a nice job with lighting,  restaurant is nicely decorated and well spaced for covid and a nice outside seating area.  3.5 stars.  I wasn't overwhelmed, thought it was good not great.  Can get a very nice dinner in Logan sq / Bucktown /Wicker for much better value and food would be just as good or better.",

They\u2019ve some vegetarian options on the menu as well, that I greatly appreciate. Also loved their Ponche, which is Mexican fruit punch.

For the main course, I had the lamb barbacoa w/tortillas. The lamb was presented very well with an entire steamed lamb neck. It came with flour tortillas (personally I prefer corn), a goat cheese spread and pickled vegetables. The lamb was very bland and needed more salt in my opinion.  My partner had the fish. The fish was cooked well but the dish overall was very very salty.  For the dessert we had the snowman dessert. It was an average dish mainly used for the IG and influencer purpose. Personally, I wished it had more ice cream.  The main reason why I\u2019m giving this 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 is the service. From the host to our seater to our server Jose. The service was excellent. They were very nice and attentive to al out requests.",

Hubby had the barbacoa and he felt it needed some broth or something it wasnt dry but it ate dry. Then for desert with had the hazelnut cake and it was nice && moist, definitely a great way to end the meal. Our server was awesome, very helpful when we had questions and made sure we were nice and warm. Overall excellent experience in sue we will be back in the near future.

The owner was the first Latin American person that won a Michelin star and the food honors the award.

        "caption": "This review will not be enough to share just how AMAZING Tzuco is. Celebrated a friends birthday here and it was the perfect place! You feel \u201cspecial\u201d from the moment you walk in. We went during the end of October, closer to Dia de Los Muertos and they decorated absolutely beautifully. They have the traditional marigolds everywhere throughout the restaurant and patio. They even had an ofrenda. I recommend just go here and bundle up to enjoy the delicious food and experience on their patio.  During the restriction in place, they do have outside dining (with walls) and they opened an area of their restaurant that has high-top seating. The top is slightly uncovered, so it can get cold, BUT they do have a few heaters. All staff did have on mask and they require you to wear one, when a server or employee stops by the table. They do check your temperature at the hostess\u2019s stand. Also, hand sanitizer was available. Once you are seated, the table has a QR code sticker to view the menu.  Tzuco is a upscale Mexican cuisine restaurant with a French twist! The menu offers traditional dishes from appetizers to dessert, even wines and cocktails. Every dish has so much detail to it and so much flavor. Even the food presentation has so much detail. Chef Carlos Gayt\u00e1n is a true artist. Staff was friendly from the moment we walked in and our waiter Keevan made my friends birthday even more special. Keevan was friendly and provided great recommendations.  Every dish was memorable and had so much flavor, that I don\u2019t even have a favorite. For appetizers, we tried:  Mejillones - which is mussels, saffron beurre blanc, dried chorizo, pickled jalape\u00f1os served with a baguette. This dish was so good that we even asked for extra bread to dip into the saffron beurre blanc. This was my first time trying dried chorizo and it was sooo good! Honestly, not to sound crazy, but I would have the saffron beurre blanc with a spoon.  Pulpo enamorado - this was a guajillo roasted octopus, with salsa macha, pickled carrot, peas, and potato in Tonnato aioli. This was a little spicy, not bad for me, however, my spice tolerance is high. The pickled carrot, peas and potato was interesting and added a nice crunch with the octopus.  I could have ate the portions for the appetizers alone, so I recommend if you are going to share with someone, try more than one appetizer.  For entrees, my friend and I split this as well, but the portions are good for 1. We tried:  Tzuco burger - I know why order a burger at a upscale Mexican French cuisine restaurant right? IT IS SO WORTH IT and I HIGHLY recommend it. The burger is a beef sirloin, with roasted tomatoes, gruyere cheeese, pickled YELLOW BEETS, black truffle sauce, and black truffle aioli, served with pommes fries. Again, soooo much flavor! I purposely capitalized the YELLOW BEETS, because you read that right. I have NEVER tried yellow beets, nor have I ever had beets on my burger, and this was sooo good! Every ingredient was tasty and the burger was cooked perfectly. I drenched the burger in the black aioli sauce and mmmmm it was so good! I even dipped my fries into the aioli! The fries are garlic butter and Parmesan cheese and again cooked perfectly, with a nice crunch.  Pesca Deli Dia - this is fish of the day in some mole verde sauce, had pickled red onions and then it is served with tamal Nejo which is like flat unstuffed tamales. If you never heard, had or seen this, it\u2019s kinda like a cold potato. This dish was very good and the portion was definitely enough to share.  To end our meal, they brought my friend a complimentary dessert.",

My girlfriend and I tried the ceviche tatemado, corn esquites, daily spread, and pulpo enamorado - all were phenomenal and beautifully presented, though our personal favorite was the octopus. My only gripe is that service was fairly slow, as it took over 30 minutes between our first and second round of food. Despite this, I'd love to return!  Note: I want to add this just as a quick heads up to the management - when we asked for the check, the waiter placed it in front of me rather than between me and my girlfriend. I know it's small, but it's something that waiters should know not to assume since it promotes some patriarchal ideas about who the \"bread winner\" is.  Edit: recently returned, and the second meal was even better than the first. The maiz y azafran was one of the best desserts I've had in Chicago. The ceviche verde was delicious and very playful with both texture and temperature. The pescadilla was the only item that did not impress.",

While I wouldn\u2019t consider us one of the regulars, this wasn\u2019t our first or second time dining at Tzuco.  Over the weekend, on a Saturday around 8/9pm, my boyfriend and I wanted to grab a drink and some apps. We go up to the hostesses outside and ask if we can come in for a drink. What looked like the manager, skimmed her iPad and dismissed us rudely by saying \u201cwe are busy at the moment.\u201d She did not try to accommodate us and didn\u2019t ask if we wanted to put our name down to make a reservation for the next available table. This made me wonder if the staff treated us the way they did because of the way we were dressed casually or because of our American flag face mask?  We walk away a few steps and out of curiosity, I pull up the online reservations just to see that the next available time slot was within a 20 min wait... so we book a reservation for 9:15pm. We get seated on the patio, and had to wait 20+ min for someone to come and greet us. At this point we lost our appetite, and wanted to leave. However, after what we had to go through, we decided to order two drinks for which we had to wait another 15 min. A simple mimosa and a cocktail.  We get our drinks, and another 15 min passes before the waitress comes to our table to ask if we want to order anything. (Just wanted to mention how she was frequently checking up on the tables around us). Anyways, we ask for the check which was brought to us immediately. We else could go wrong? The waitress failed to give us a pen and was no where to be found. At this point we just want to leave. We were forced to sign the bill with a LIP LINER.  The two stars are for good food and drinks.",

There was background music and noise from other diners but was not too loud and could have a good conversation while there.  The food choices had a variety of options. My wife and I shared 5 appetizers (spreads and bread, tuna ceviche, Tzuco salad, pulpo, steak tartare) but did not get any of the main dishes. We each also had a couple cocktails (Paloma, margarita, March of the dead, Amargo amor). Cocktails were good, bright flavors and went well with the food, I did not think they were novel compared to other restaurants we have been to in the area.  Our thoughts on the food was it was overall lacking a little in salt. On a few bites I used the salt from the rim of the Margarita glass and I thought it brought out more flavor, helped with the octopus and one of the spreads. I liked the ceviche the best of the dishes we tried. The steak tartare is prepared with guacamole and I thought the guacamole overpowered the rest of the dish.  Overall I would try it again but was expecting a little more from the flavors.",

Whoever came by to clean the table started speaking Spanish to us. We looked confused and then he asked us \" finished \"? We said yes and we requested the food to go. When the check came our food did not reappear. Turns out that the restaurant threw  the food away.  The food and the service was pretty good but they did throw away about $100 worth of food.

She kept threatening to give away my table every other minute while I waited, as my friend was a few minutes late to our reservation due to the weather. She then proceeded to let us and the table (two empty tables away) know when our \"table eviction time\" was and kept coming back to hover around staring at us and then her watch and tablet, even though there were plenty of empty tables nearby. Our entrees were a little late coming out of the kitchen (not a big deal), but she would come back and give us a death stare for not having quickly eaten our entrees. We ordered dessert and this \"extra time\" beyond what she told us was our time to leave, made her roll her eyes and stomp around our table. She ruined our whole experience of what would have otherwise been a great meal.",

I took two stars off because first, tortilla chips in my guacamola wasnt fresh, almost not crispy, and hard to chew. Not because it dipped into the guacamole, though. Second, main course was good, but to be honest not something I will miss in the future. The dessert also nice, but quite small compare to other dessert named ping\u00fcino.",

Either way... we politely mentioned we preferred to sit at a table and she was extremely rude in her tone and replying that \u201cyou booked this seat\u201d and offered no option to even see what she could do. Ultimately the drinks and the food were quite good and service from the food runners was very professional. But they really need to step up the hostess service or they will fail trying to be an upscale restaurant.

For some reason I didn't find it as  enjoyable as Mexique. I have longed for the flavors of Mexique ever since they closed.  We did have some good dishes such as the octopus appetizer and the mussel appetizer.  Those dishes were phenomenal.  I believe we enjoyed the small plates more than the entree selections.

Come with a group that is willing to share because you will want to try everything. They have a full bar in case need something to wake you up.

The Santa Cruda cocktail was very smooth and well balanced. The steak tartare was unremarkable but fine. It lacked acid, spice and the attention that was present in our other dishes. The service was great, and the space is refreshing in its light, space, and earthiness. A gorgeous invitation to Guerrero: I accept!",

The chicken tinga is good, nothing crazy, and the carne asada is also great but isn\u2019t much different from a steakhouse other than the fondue sauce. All the desserts are very good but the one with tapioca is one of the highlights of the night.  Overall all of the food was great and the atmosphere really tied everything together well.

Tzuco offered a number of more adventurous offerings which I will try on another visit.  Servers were attentive and the efficient.  If you go request to sit at the kitchen countertop and you can watch all the art in action.  One detraction was the host who had a New York snooty attitude (in Chicago) and advised me my walk in wait on a Wednesday night would be three hours.  Oh please save the attitude (I was seated within 15 minutes).",

We had the camar\u00f3n & sand\u00eda and it was so fresh and well seasoned. The mejillones were succulent and the beurre blanc was so tasty. The esquites were nice and smokey. For entrees we had the Chile relleno and pork pibil. The Chile relleno was nicely seasoned, the filling was full of flavor and had a a good amount of umami. The pibil was nice and tender and the beans and salsa had the perfect balance of saltyness, acid and heat. For desserts we had the ping\u00fcino and the avocado dessert. They were tasty but the ping\u00fcino was missing something fruity (perhaps a raspberry coulis or jam?). Also the pearls in the avocado dessert were super limey (sour), in my opinion they needed to be diluted a little or maybe needed a little more sugar. My only reccomendation is that servers/food runner need some re-training. The camar\u00f3n & sandia needs to be served with teaspoons for everybody at the table just so we can enjoy the delicious aguachile. The mejillones bread should be pre-sliced (or at least scored). The bread is so hard to cut with the butter knife provided. And only 4 tortillas for the pibil? We had about ten tacos out of the plate and the first round of tortillas were cold. I went ahead and spoke with the server about these concerns and, unfortunately, his response could have been better. He proceeded to blame the food runners for the mistakes and wasn't able to fix the problem right away (literally just say: \"I'm sorry\" and bring more spoons, that's it) Chef Gaytan, your menu is amazing! I can't wait to come back and eat your delicious food again.",

After we were seated, we were welcomed by a greeter by the name of Linda. She proceeded to educate us about the history of Tzuco and how it came about. Everything from the authentic decor right down to the precise ingredients in the food has been carefully selected and imorted to become an intrical piece of this dining experience. We shared several selections from the varied menu and there was not a single item that we could brag more about. Everything was crafted with care and precision. Linda met with us several time during the course of our meal. She was very knowledgable, friendly and welcoming. We will definitly be going back soon and taking more friends and family. .",
