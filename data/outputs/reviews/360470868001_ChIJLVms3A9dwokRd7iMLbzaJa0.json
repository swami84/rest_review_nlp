When customers complained, she tell them come at the back and do it themselves. Chicken not cooked properly, even though i said well done. Flavors i ordered, i didnt get them. Seems like the chicken came from the box and straight into the oil, no flavor. Waste my time and money. The food box was dirty with bbq sauce on the outside. Poor presentation.",

Customers were in line, very inappropriate. All because the fryer was beeping and no one went to stop it right away? Really? Mmhh, not happy with that as a customer. If he was concerned he's not too high up on the food chain to stretch his arm out and stop the machine himself! Otherwise the young lady on the register was polite, took my order as quick as possible. No complaints there. Place was clean. Lights were out in the store so it didn't look too inviting as it did when it first opened but I chalk up the lackluster ambiance due to covid and operations being different. Staff also changed, use to be full of nice friendly managers, workers happy to be there or they at least appeared to be happy. But then again with someone talking to me like he power tripping I wouldn't be happy either so that's that.....I just decided I will not go back. That whole scene turned me off and it just seem so ghetto to be talking to folks like you're their parent no matter what your title is or how old they are. No thanks. We all put our pants on one leg at a time, no one is any different from or above the next...oh yea the food was ok. Not great like it use to be so go at your own discretion. I won't be going back obviously.",

We were at the restaurant on time only to have to wait, along with dozens of other people, for over two hours! There is no one available to speak with about refunding the $40 order. One employee sticks her head out of the door every 15 minutes to distribute orders but besides that, no communication at all with customers. Many people are very irate and demanding refunds but she isn\u2019t listening, just closing the door until she reappears with another few orders.

I began to do the survey on their website as I waited for my order. I started encountering a series of questions that couldn't have the answer to yet (Did it take a long time to receive your order?). Nevertheless, I finished the survey. I showed the cashier that I completed it and when they called my name to claim my order, the same cashier looked in the bag and confirmed that the free fries were I there. Wonderful. I went home to find that I was given the wrong order. I wanted to fix what I was certain to be an honest (yet negligent) mistake, so I called the Wing Stop. As soon as the phone was answered, I heard someone rattle off about 2 unintelligible sentences that began with \"thank you for calling Wing Stop\". Before I can even speak, they just put the phone down as I could hear things going on in the store. They basically just answered the phone to stop it from ringing, with no intention of actually taking the call! 0 customer service skills on display here. I went back to the Wing Stop and I show the same cashier that my order is incorrect. They then tell me that I took someone else's food... even though they called my name. I had to laugh because the name of the person that order was intended for- their name sounds nothing like mine. Imagine standing in a Wing Stop, arguing with a cashier about whether your own name wasn't called. How silly that would have been. I just wanted the food I paid for. Instead of apologizing, they took my order out of the bag, put it on the counter then asked me if I want a bag... I replied yes, then they get another folded bag and hand me the bag to put my food in... even though the food was just in a bag. Imagine doubling down on a lie, then having an attitude about it... HORRIBLE. Very unpleasant with a \"whatever\" attitude. The food was alright, but would have been better if I got it 45 minutes earlier like I was supposed to. I don't think I'll go back to this Wing Stop, or maybe I'll have a better experience if that cashier moves on to another \"whatever\" job. If I could score this place 0 stars, I most definitely would.",

But the food was delicious and the veggies were abundant...more than I need to purchase a double order. I really thank WingStop for that because no matter where I go for wings I only get a few pieces of veggies. Please keep that up! And if you want another order of veggies it's only about a dollar more. The only problem I had was that the water from the veggies caused the paper bag to leak and almost break. WingStop please allow us the option for plastic bags. Great place all in all! Blue Cheese is delicious!",

It's either they forget your drink which you paid for,give you the wrong sides bone in instead of boneless vice versa or the the wrong flavors period.If they don't do something about their customer service I dont see this place lasting past another year and a half. The answer isn't always to give the customer something free we want what we paid for on the 1st attempt.

        "caption": "I wanted to give this place three stars a few days ago. I decided to give it another try first. And now it gets 2 stars off the strength that the customer service is phenomenal.  The first time I went the \"manager\" was there. He was very attentive to the customers but was very overbearing (\"Hi everyone, I am the manager and I'm sorry for the wait.....). I am not complaining about the wait time; apparently the wings are cooked to order. With the 18 to 25 min wait WINGSTOP could season the damn wings. Just because Ross is losing weight doesnt mean that we have to eat healthy too.  The sauces are excellent. Please throw some seasoning on the chicken.  If you're going here, order via their website ahead of time or you'll be sitting inside waiting for your food.  In their defense this is a new store. I hope they see this review.",
