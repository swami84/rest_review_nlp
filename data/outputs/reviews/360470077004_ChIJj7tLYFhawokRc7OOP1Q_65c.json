Unfortunately the delivery took about an hour and 45 minutes. Normally I just contact the courier directly, but Uber Eats informed me that I would need to call the restaurant. I\u2019m not sure if they do their own deliveries, but that could be why. I called for updates twice, and was told that our order had just been received (45 mins into the order) and then called back about 20 minutes later for another update and was told our food had left the restaurant \u201ca long time ago\u201d. We eventually got our food and ate it. But it was cold and not very appetizing. We may give them a other try in the future and hopefully we will have a better experience then.",

        "caption": "I've been coming here for years and genuinely enjoy the food, and the employees are always friendly. But after moving to the new location I have had some issues. The service is frequently slow, although there are more employees working. And food orders frequently have the wrong ingredients, or when ordering something with a specific request, the request is not factored in to the order. For example, I order a couple of sandwiches that I like to add bacon to, and always ask for \"crispy\" bacon. But almost every time the bacon is really undercooked and inedible for me. At the significantly raised prices they are now charging (the chicken pesto with bacon hero is $21!), this is not really acceptable. Overall I like Brooklyn Bread, and want to keep patronizing them, but I hope that they will find a way to more efficiently run the counter, and that they will train their food prep staff to pay more attention to detail.",

They seem flustered with 3-4 orders with a max of two people on a given order. e.g. The clerk whom serviced me had asked her colleague to open up her register... there was 3 girl working the counter; the coffee did come quick so that was nice.  Food -  was good?, but It took 15 - 20 minutes (2 items) and my order came out wrong... I did notice that someone new was being trained; the head cook acknowledged that the food was late and I took them about 5 min to get it out, so that's a plus. However, the interaction seem more unfriendly on the cooks part, they kept repeating \"it's coming out soon \" which I didn't ask, and repeating it when someone just wait seem more rude than polite.  atmosphere - 1 service - 1/4 cleanliness - 0 food - 1 value for money - 3/4",

It's a great spot to pick up a sandwich for lunch or dinner (they're hearty sandwiches too, and reasonably priced), bakery-quality cookies if you're craving something sweet, or a cake or pie if you're entertaining guests. I wish they had kept their Park Slope location, but worth the walk over to Carroll Gardens for one of their delicious bagels.",

The staff? They try. They aren't rude per se, but the turnover is so high that they aren't in a position most times to make much in the way of pleasantries. Grab a  paper menu, decide what you would like then get in line. Order  and then move away from the counter, the cashier isn't the one making the food so you mess with the flow by setting up shop at the counter after you order. The prices are great and the Sandwich selection can keep you in new options for months.",
