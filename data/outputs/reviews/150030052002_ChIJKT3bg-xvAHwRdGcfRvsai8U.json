I have explored.the fruits of the ocean from Florida to Maine but the Hawaiian Lobster Roll scene is at its top. Jolenes market aka Da Buttah Lobstah is one of my top contenders on the island for best Lobster roll!  First, the Lobster is incredible. It's served as a Lobster salad with big huge chunks of Lobster meat in every bite. It's got a nice refreshing Asian Slaw that compliments the Lobster so well, but the game changer here, yes... the game changer, is the split top roll. I dont know how they make it but it's like an elevated Hawaiian Roll - its sweet, but firm, but also light and fluffy. If you have a big mouth like me, you will struggle fitting this sandwich in, but once you get all those flavors swirling and mixing together, you won't put the sandwich down. And it's packed, no... overflowing with goodness, so.when your done, there's a good bit left on the plate, fortunately it's served with a fork. I got mine with fries. They were a pretty standard fry, no complaints and they were served crispy and hot! This is probably my 3rd or so review here and it's top quality and consistent everytime!",

Naturally,  they were busy, even with tourists on their way to the airport.  Good to see. Ordering takeout was reasonably quick and painless although, getting lucky with front door parking definitely helped. Service was pretty quick and was great to see staff helping each other. Personally,  I'd limit service to only takeout so they can turn parking faster, but that's just me. In all, worth the wait and definitely the best valued lobster roll in town so far at $18, (s/p fries +$2). It's a hearty and tasty sandwich.  Feast in Manoa is next on my list but Jolene's was worth trying, and I will definitely go back at some point to dabble in the rest of the menu. Simple but variety. The spicy sausage was also pretty good and came with a homemade slaw. I gotta say though, their buttered, toasted, house baked sweet roll is part of their secret. It kinda rocks and compliments both sandwiches. Anyway, pretty lengthy review on my part, on purpose.  Rock the Lobster Roll!  2/23/21 Just been to their last competitor in town. Jolene's rocks the best Lobstah Roll in town, especially for the price. Nice job guys!",

Both of our melts had a good portion of protein spread to every corner. They didn\u2019t go light on the melts at all! Again, you can\u2019t not go wrong with trying this place out!

The roll was buttery and soft while the lobster was generous and tasty. The chicken sandwich, which I also got spicy, was not very impressive. Probably won't get that again. But the BBQ Brisket Melt is super yummy. Their brisket is slowly cooked, and you can taste all their spices and the smokiness but its also not too salty. Its wonderful! My favorite, I think. Prices are on average above $10 but their portions are pretty good and I think, well worth it. See what all the hype is about for yourself! (Also, there is parking right in front of the store front off of S.Beretania St. The spaces are limited, maybe about 10. But there's also street parking and parking in the plaza, as well.)",

He brought a bunch of co workers with him and was embarrassed by the lack of quality control.  First time he tried the lobster he was delighted at the quantity of 2 claws in his roll.  Second time around it was significantly smaller with only 1 claw.  After raving about it to all his friends and family only to find it sub par.  Paul talked to Charlene about it and was told they have no control over the quality of their foods.  She was extremely rude summing it up that he didn't need to come through her doors if he doesn't like it. Would highly recommend you take your business elsewhere.

Bar is limited but good prices and generous pours if you want basic drinks. It got super crowded around 6pm on Friday so might need a reservation if you have a big group. They also do Chinese food (which looked great and we're going back to try, coffees and Dave's ice cream ... Like 20 flavors). I like the variety. Parking at Cultural Plaza.
