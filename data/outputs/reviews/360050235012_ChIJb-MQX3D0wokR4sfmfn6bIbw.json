I asked the lady if the chicken was fresh. She claims that it just came out as they are a 24/7 restaurant. The chicken was hard as a brick and the rice taste like vomit. I\u2019ve eaten at many Jamaican restaurants and never tasted food so awful. These people don\u2019t get much business so they leave the food out all day until it\u2019s finished. On top of the restaurant is very dirty. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",
