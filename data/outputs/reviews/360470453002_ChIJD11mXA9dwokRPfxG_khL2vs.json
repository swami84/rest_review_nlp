We ordered 5 sides/appetizers including the lemon potatoes, saganaki, salad, octopus, and lemon potatoes. My husband never likes octopus but he enjoyed this one! We also shared two entrees, the chicken souvlaki with rice and the lamb souvlaki with fried sliced potatoes. The potatoes are delicious! We also had the house red wine and it is delicious. We are about to ask if we can buy some to take home. We sat in the back and were warm with the heater, covered by a tent, and with a lot of ventilation.",

I'm Greek, so i have a true understanding of what Greek food should taste like, and unfortunately - as with most Greek restaurants outside of Astoria - the food here is simply OK.  Let's start with the 5 star items:  - Very friendly staff with what appears to be a true interest in keeping patrons happy (based on my interaction, and what I saw with other tables) - Lovely backyard patio and decor,, as well as some tables on Flushing Ave. - Clean and appropriate social distancing. - Prices are very good and portions are nicely sized. - Grilled Octopus was excellent.  Now to the 3 star items:  - Red Sangria was ok.  Nicely priced for $4 for Happy Hour, however way too much ice in the glass (so you end up having to get more). - Keftedakia (Greek style meatballs) were also ok.  Seasoning wasn't apparent and they were slightly over cooked on the outside. - The Tzatziki was nice, as was the Pita Bread.  Now to the 1.5 star items\" - The Fried Calamari was tasteless, too crunchy, and came out way too quick after ordering.  Seems like it was pre cooked and left standing.  No way it can be prepped within 5 minutes of ordering.  Absolutely not worth trying at all. - The Saganaki (Fried Cheese) would have been better had it not had a strong taste of liquor (its a flambe situation) that leaves an awful aftertaste.  Not sure what other items taste like, but based on my experience today, I'd be hesitant to go back.",

You have Greek radio playing in the back ground, service is fast and very friendly. The google ratings are really well deserved! Have tried most of the Greek restaurants in NYC over the years including the \u201ctop-rated-overly expensive ones\u201d but nothing compares to Yia Yia\u2019s Tarverna (Grand Mother\u2019s Tavern) ad the food is cooked with passion! Even if I never take a mixed grill, for 27$ we ate so much and still had to take the rest home!  The area where the place is located is very vibrant with loads of little resto\u2019s and bars in the hood.",

We ordered a lamb dish for each one, with rice or potatoes, plus the salad. My daughters asked for shrimp instead of lamb. We drink sangria and wine. We got a delicious, caramel dessert. All for $ 120. We were between 5 people. Very good cost benefit. We will vote.  (Original) Excelente  ambiente. Fomos muito bem recebidos. Nos deram um aperitivo com pasta de iogurte, azeitonas e peda\u00e7os de p\u00e3es,  tipo massa de pizza. Pedimos um prato de cordeiro para cada um, com arroz ou batata, mais a salada. Minhas filhas pediram camarao ao inv\u00e9s de cordeiro. Tomamos sangria e vinho. Ganhamos uma sobremesa  deliciosa , caramelada. Tudo por 120 d\u00f3lares. Est\u00e1vamos entre 5 pessoas.

The service and food were great and the ambiance is very laid back and casual. If you like a place with loud music and pretentious staff then this is probably not for you. But if you enjoy hearing your table mates and like it when the service is friendly and attentive then go here. The free glass of sangria and dessert also didn\u2019t hurt ;-)",

Lunch special comes with a huge portion which I think enough for two if both are light eaters. I order a lamb sandwich and boy it has everything in there. Packed with lamb, veggie and topped with some fries Greek style, i asked for mustard sauce but they don't have. Everything comes up just below $15 for a sit-down lunch.  This place isnt that pack during lunch hours with about half of the place filled for the whole duration I was there. The wait service is quick and on point.  I have to say something about their Greek fries. It's actually really good with lite seasoning. The shape is actually better than the usual McDonald's style. I would ask for some of their ranch sauce to dip in.",

The music they play feeds well into the ambiance. For appetizers, the four cheese balls and the stuffed grape leaves are pretty good, aside from the classic hummus and pita. I always like getting the biftekia or a chicken gyro as my entree. The plates come with quite a bit of food so take your time, sit down and enjoy it. For desserts, the baklava and rice pudding are pretty good. I've also had the Greek yogurt with cranberry jam, bittersweet but also a nice option.",

First of all, the overall environment was just warm and welcoming. The servers were all very kind and patient when explaining the menu items, and they even treated us with an appetizer while we waited for our other friends to arrive.  The owner came out and thanked us for visiting the restaurant, which I thought was such an exceptional gesture. Honestly. Here I am a couple of weeks later, and this still sticks in my mind as a genuine act of going above and beyond. A-plus customer service. We truly felt that our patronage was appreciated.  Food was fantastic. Portions were huge. We all left feeling full and satisfied and in good spirits from the positive dining experience. We all ordered different entr\u00e9es, and we were all happy with what we had chosen.  I never write reviews, but I wanted to make sure I wrote one for this restaurant. I don\u2019t live in NYC anymore, but I visit frequently, and you can bet I\u2019ll be back! :-)",
