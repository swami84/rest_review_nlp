It is a seafood place but their Mac and cheese, yams, garlic mash, and fried chicken is sooooo good too. I get the ultimate bag boil, you can not go wrong or I go for the seafood trio which comes with salmon, shrimp, lobster, and two sides of your choice. When I am lazy I order from uber eats/ grub hub or ask for delivery. Would definitely recommend..not to mention the staff is great, thank you!",
