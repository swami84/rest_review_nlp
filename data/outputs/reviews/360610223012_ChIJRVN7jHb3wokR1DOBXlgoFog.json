Even thought I ordered hours in advance my order didn\u2019t arrive. Doordash said they had closed and it was only 6PM! I actually tried ordering from this place one more time. Doordash took the order and the time for delivery. When it came time to be delivered they cancelled again without warning. I made my own delicious melted cheese sandwich in my cast iron pan and it was better than theirs. I will never order from such an unreliable place again. (Los Angeles restaurant)",

Personally i took 2 orders because i didn't know they have many business names under the same business. I would never go there and get your food from them again. Never ever.",
