Located on the second floor above Joyee, this hidden gem offers a ton of variety from boba, ice cream, cakes, shave ice and more. The interior is very trendy and has many spots for cute pictures. I\u2019d recommend any of the mango items here because the mangos are perfectly ripe and sweet. We tried the water melon and mango seasonal item and it was perfect for an after dinner dessert because it was refreshing and not too heavy. I will be back here to try more things on the menu like the pancakes and cakes. If you are ever in Chinatown check out this place.",

I brought my friends to eat some of the mango, pomelo, masago dessert. We got the A3 and A2. I personally like the ones without the white sauce because it retains more of the mango flavoring. This is my go to place for this dessert. I would like to try the crepe cakes and the durian versions but maybe by myself. Only thing I'd wish for is a little more mango in it.",

This was absolutely delicious and a perfect treat in the warm summer. We also decided to order the mango pancakes because we saw a bunch of people with them. These aren't really worth it.

I know some people love durian, but I don\u2019t. The strong smell of durian really bothered me the entire time we were in the restaurant.  The menu has plenty of selections, mostly everything with mangoes. I noticed there are some asian desserts as well like black sesame porridge, etc. We ordered two desserts, basically they were the same, just different toppings (grass jelly n mochi).
