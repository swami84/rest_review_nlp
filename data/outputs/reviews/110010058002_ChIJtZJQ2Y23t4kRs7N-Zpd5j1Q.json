But moreover, during my most recent visit, I accidentally left my books on their counter before leaving with my takeout order in a hurry. Within a few minutes, they called me (I\u2019m assuming they thought to be proactive and get my number from my online order, rather than wait until I realize I forgot my books.) I greatly appreciated that.  On top of great food, they seem like genuinely good people. The lavender bubble tea and sesame buns are my favorite.",

The spare ribs took the longest to arrive (normal at dim sum) but they were cold and the center of the bowl hot. They must have been sitting in the kitchen this whole time! The other items like the chicken feet were not fresh to order and most likely prepped the day before; they were rubbery. Also ordered the beef pad thai which was really wet and you could tell the sauce was vinegary ketchup. We were going to order more to-go and we were glad we didn't (I'm positive the egg tart and others would be frozen).",

My friend and I were looking for a place to sit and chat as we  waited for a table at a restaurant nearby. My friend and I tried ordering tea and some baked goods. It was very difficult to figure out if the tea was served by cup or pot.The baked goods seemed a little pricey for the size. The worker heated them in the microwave and then served them to us in French fry trays. While we are eating the worker is skyping with a friend. About 9:10pm the worker walks by, looks at her watch, and sighs loudly.  She then says, \"It is closing time soon...\" and walks away and appears to make an annoyed face which I can see by one of the shop mirrors. We continue chatting and at 9:15pm both workers put on their coats and grab their bags. While we are drinking and eating, the worker takes the tea away without saying anything. They both seem annoyed we are there. I ask for a bag for our baked good, and we are quickly pushed out.  Super rude and unprofessional. It was also quite annoying we deliberately asked what time they closed and then they closed shop early. The food was not spectacular either...I personally liked the jasmine tea though. Overall I do not recommend this place.",

Then, on Monday October 08, 2018 I decided to go again to grab a bite to eat why would I go again I don't know but if the tofu was good I figured that maybe their was a different cook, word of advice, always go with your very first gut feeling, don't ask me why I did not follow my own advice, so instead of trying a different Chinese restaurant there are so many in Gallery place the genius in me as stated went back for a double dosage, unfortunately,  there is no were to cook based on were I temporarily reside, so therefor I have to eat out gets expensive due to the fact of being a college student, as mentioned I came back for even worse punishment, this time I ordered shrimp and broccoli with no rice to go, and once again the same young lady from Friday gave me my food, my lovely intuition in which I ignore especially when needed, motivated me to look inside the container before I departed. I realllllllllllllllllllllllllllly wish I took a picture of this ohhhhhhh, wait it gets better the same mysterious chef, was the same man who cooked my food that Friday, I only had to wait one minute or less that's how I knew something was wrong, at least bump it up to two minutes I mean create an illusion that I am really in for a good deluxe of a treat, ignorant bad English of a cook,  put only three shrimps and ten to twelve broccoli's' in a large container true story, I wish they had cameras they needed to, I was so disgusted once again and demanded more the young lady said I would have to pay again, it was ignorance and disgust at its finest I took a deep breath, and told her either put more in here or give me my money back, so she she went back with my food and gave it to the cook and what do you know, it was the same cook small world, because of the rage he had, quoting outburst in Asian so unprofessional and low class, I was automatically able to recognize it was the original cook from two days before just by remembering voices which is a plus. The whole point of this lecture is to inform those who are reading this always follow your intuition. I could have saved money and time. I hope visitors experience something different maybe but mines was horrible. (apologies for sentence structure).",

We stopped by the highly rated China Boy but quickly exited out of the door - that place is pretty much just a takeout place, tiny with only 2 tables.  We needed to SIT.  We desperately found the nearby Chinatown Express, however, it had long lines waiting through the door.  So we had to settle for Joy Luck House, which is right next door.  Food: We ordered 4 noodle dishes: Bean Sauce w/ Meat, Pork LoMein, Beef Chow Fun, and Beef Noodle Soup. All were $9.45 and that's about as high as one can price these standard takeout dishes.  While they were all OK, they weren't good enough to stop us having second thoughts --  that we should have waited in line for the Chinatown Express next door.  Service: You order and pay food at the counter and they bring to your table when ready.  The same lady did both and she was friendly, did nothing beyond her duties, though. An older man would periodically come out of the kitchen and clear the tables where necessary. He's either the cook or the owner or maybe both. He's very grumpy. We could hear him grumbling as he went about doing his thing.  Not good for the business!   One surprise was that this little Mom & Pop operation accepted credit cards!!  Bottom line: If you can afford to wait in line, go to Chinatown Express next door which is Zagat rated, cheaper for the same dishes; the long line has to be for a reason.  I give it a reluctant 3 stars, though I suspect I might have given it a 2 if we weren't so hungry.",
