When walking in I did not know the seafood was In a bag but when I started seeing others get there food I got excited well we got excited it was me and my daughter. I spent about 50 dollars but that was for two people one bag feeds two people well I got the 40 dollar deal for two and it was so much in that bag it\u2019s like it was never ending we took the rest home and it was so good reheated I\u2019m guessing the bag keeps the steam so they don\u2019t dry out when you reheat them. Also another fun fact when you get to the bottom of the bag don\u2019t throw that away there\u2019s like a soup almost like gumbo omg just thinking about it I can\u2019t wait to go back I did take video but you would have to check out my YouTube channel for that Chicago love \u2764\ufe0f",

I arrived at 9:24 I was not greeted I was stopped at the entrance with a woman holding the door blocking me from entering saying \u201cdo you have a pick up?\u201d I said no we\u2019re here to eat. Then she says uhhhhhhhhh the kitchen closes in 5 minutes. I said ok, can I just use your bathroom (we\u2019ve been on a road trip) I come out and see my husband ordering so we sit down the waitress takes our order then comes right back and says \u201cthis is to go right?\u201d At no point did we ask to have it to go then she comes out and says we\u2019re closing. I said, \u201c what time do you close?\u201d She said 10pm and it was only 9:30. They made us extremely uncomfortable in their establishment and if my husband wasnt desperate for crab boil we would have left like they actually wanted us too. I\u2019m a firm believer that your last customer should be just as important as your first customer. We couldn\u2019t get dessert because \u201cthe person who makes it already left\u201d To top it off the crab boil was not the best, not bad but not great. When the waitress explained the reason for the way we were treated she said we only had five customers today so we were trying to close early. In that case, I would think they would have been more grateful for a customer. This might explain why they are lacking customers. The one star is for the smile the one waitress had while she made excuses for why we were treated bad. (Using my husband acct to leave this review)",

The place came recommended so we gave it another try. he got the snow crab w/corn. i got the lobsters with corn garlic butter. coco curry on the side. we also shared crab fried rice .. it was ok. crab not much meat. lotta work and wouldnt pull out in big pieces. very little crab meat. super messy and not very good. the spices overwhelmed the meat. so we weren't impressed. both nights an elderly asian lady sat in the back looking miserable.. i assumed a relative. felt bad for her she just looked so unhappy.",

My family literally lives in Maine so I have had the best of the best when it comes to lobster rolls, but what made this one special was how different and yet well delivered it was. It had no mayonnaise, just a perfectly toasted roll with butter and claw and tail lobster meat. It was simple but each component was perfectly executed.. the roll was perfect, the amount of butter was perfect, etc. My only complaint would have to be the price and portion size. It should also be noted that I came at an odd time so I was the only one in the place, but I still had to ask for a refill on my soda and had to ask for my check. Still, the waitress was friendly and polite. In that way the service was similar to the food: good (better than most) but not stellar.",

I was told the crab rice was tasty as were the cajun fries. Sweet potato fries were bland...like the just cut the potatoes and dropped them in the oil for frying. Nothing to write home about.  Wings were good. Drinks were tasty and strong and in tall glasses, which is rare for West Loop drinks. The other con is that they don't really have a lot of sauce options, most notably as a seafood place they didn't have tartar sauce or cocktail sauce. If you're a person that likes sauces or marinades ask when ordering and then, tell them to bring extra otherwise you'll just get 1 little cup.",
