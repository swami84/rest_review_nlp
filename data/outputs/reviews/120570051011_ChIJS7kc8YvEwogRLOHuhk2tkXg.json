        "caption": "Delicious! Original recipes from across the pond and plenty of local, freshly made favorites. This deli/cafe is on the second floor of the Fifth Third building in downtown Tampa connected by a sky bridge to the Bank of America building. It\u2019s bright and cheery and welcoming. Pool table, television and vending machines for off hours. But the best part is the actual cafe. Each item is made fresh and to order. The fruit sides are a true variety of seasonal fruits cut each morning. The bacon onion quiche is scrumptious, the bagel with cream cheese, lox and capers somehow tastes better here than in other places! The shrimp and avocado salad was a nice change from other local quick food places. This location offers breakfast and lunch and will adapt anything to your liking. On a rainy day they\u2019re packed so try them on a nicer day. Plenty of comfortable seating. It\u2019s within walking distance of Riverwalk, local hotels, Amalie Center and any nearby offices. Definitely worth it! Try the turkey BLT on multi grain bread, one of my favorites! Plenty of beverage choices, coffee drinks and international sweets and snacks! A nice surprise in a downtown office building!",

Finally went up to ask what the hold-up was since everyone in the restaurant had been served but us and was told they lost our ticket. They weren't even making it.  They asked us to reorder and wait until 10/15 minutes for it to be ready. When asked for a refund was told not possible. Expensive place with bad management. Too many other way better options nearby.",
