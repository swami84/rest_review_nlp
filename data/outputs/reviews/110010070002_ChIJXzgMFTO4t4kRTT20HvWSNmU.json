I had a steak topped with crab sauce and the steak was melt in your mouth tender.My only complaint was I wish there was more of the crab sauce topping but this in no way detracted from the meal. I dont remember the name of the wine but it was an very tasty pairing ,red mildly dry,that complemented the meal. Generous portions of my wife's meal had her smiling  during the entire evening. We were there with friends who are regulars and I was thoroughly impressed with the attention and service and friendliness of the staff. We most certainly will be going back and hope to fo so on a frequent basis.",

The quaint neighborhood eatery exceeded my expectations and I\u2019ve never had anything less than a wonderful experience there.  The food is always excellent and beautifully presented, the prices reasonable; the wait staff attentive and entertaining.  Living near Dulles, I don\u2019t get to Trattoria Alberto as often as I would like, but always book a reservation for special celebrations or intimate dinners. And when friends or family come to town, it is one of the restaurants I always recommend.  Fogeddaboudit!",

        "caption": "I totally enjoyed my dining experience at Trattoria Alberto!  And here's why:  1. Atmosphere - I decided to go here on a whim and it seemed very tight at first...until I went to the restroom and saw all of the nooks and crannies!  4 floors of seating!  Very intimate, very nostalgic, very cool and it reminded you of being at your grandma's house with the family over on a Sunday afternoon.  2. Service - I had no problem with the service at all.  As a matter of fact, the service was pretty awesome.  There was a cute blonde girl who waited on us and she wasn't pushy, she was very attentive and knew exactly when to check on us.  Everyone else on staff was very nice.  3 Food - Starting out with the calamari fritti, I ended up getting a chicken and pasta dish and my wife a scampi dish which she loved.  We both finished our plates and ordered desert.  The canoli was simply to die for!  4. Drinks - I ordered Amaretto Sours the entire night because I like Disarrono...and the were absolutely yummy!  I will NOT divulge how many I had...ahem!  =]  5. Price - for the price, it was an excellent night.  Expect to spend around $80-$100 bucks for both you and the lady and a nice bottle of wine will considerably jump the total but it's well worth it if you like quiet, intimate and cozy settings.  I loved this place!  You know, as I walked down the half-spiral stairway, I walked back out on to DC streets and felt as if I left a different world.  Such a familiarity, such a cozy, warm environment, I would definitely recommend this place again and again!",

        "caption": "I stopped in for lunch one day and had the chicken picata, it was terrible.  It was like chicken cutlets in fake half warmed butter sauce with a grit that felt like i was chewing on sand.  I was scared to eat it but i was so hungry.  They brought me the wrong drink and various other service mistakes.  I had about 3 waiters waiting on me and none of them took care of me.  I would avoid this restaurant.  I heard the current owner bought the place from the original owners and worked for Fragers Hardware before owning the restaurant (and they are not Italian).  I know many local old timers swear by it but i think they are just holding on to the way it once was.",
