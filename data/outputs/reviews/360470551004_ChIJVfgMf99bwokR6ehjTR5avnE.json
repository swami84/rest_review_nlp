When asked about the service fee, the waiter told us that they add 20% to EVERY table and \"do you have a problem?\"(direct quote).

So we asked the waiter again for the service fee, he changed his response to \"sometimes people don't tip well therefore we charge service fee to certain tables.\"  I understand restaurant add service fee to a big party but we were only party of 3, it was a bit ridiculous to add a 20\u066a service fee.",

Authentic French/Algerian with a Vietnamese twist here and there on a few dishes. The flavors are simple as advertised yet elegantly done with unique spices that I can't quite gather exactly. Maybe it's the presentation (each plate is different and straight from what i imagine a hard to find Moroccan market) but the vibe here transports you to another time and place that makes it hard to leave. You leave wanting more and yet so satisfied. Lastly, once you're finished eating, there is a small shop where you can find a token to take home to remember what an epic place this is.  Highly highly recommend.",

The French toast was magical. Everything was fresh and tasty and we all loved the different dishes we ordered. The staff was extremely nice and attentive. The only downside is the size of the establishment, it is very small so it's safer to book if you're a group of 4+. I really like the owner's little boutique at the entrance. Cherry on the cake, you feel like you just left to Algeria for a moment. I definitely recommend and will go back to try the rest of the menu!",

This plane nailed the healthy comfort food thing. I got the simple poached eggs that were light and airy but filling. I was pleasantly surprised that my meal came with a decent side salad. Veggies were fresh and the dressing had the air of a citrus vinegar eternity. I don't even love dressings but I enjoyed this one. Also had the chance to try the fried egg. Perfectly fluffy and a solid portion.  While there is an all you can eat brunch buffet option, there are not bottomless drinks available which was disappointing. The bloody Mary was solid. Not too spicy but lots of flavor. Could have used more garnish. But that's honestly nit picking.  Overall I had a very satisfying experience. I would definitely recommend this place and will be back for more tasty foodstuffs.",

Got seated and in under 30 seconds i was eating a croissant. That croissant sold me. This was a French croissant not an American one. It was the best croissant I've ever had.  Buffet was just as good with homemade everything - except the fruit...I think.  Bacon was FILL MY POCKETS BEFORE I LEAVE good. Potato au gratin, french toast, scrambled eggs, homemade bread, real jam, coffee, tea, pastries and some stuff I didn't even try.  For $14.50 this was well worth the trip. The quality of the food, real food, was what made this worth its money.  I overdid it with you he bacon and croissant and could not finish. I lucked out with a doggie bag.  I'm guessing this is a husband/wife owned place and the investment in its welfare really shows. Super good food and a very french cafe experience.  They even charged my phone while I was there. Nice to eat without electronics.  I will probably go back before you leave...only here for 5 days but still...bacon!",

I highly recommend this address!  (Original) Nous avons pris le buffet pour le petit d\u00e9jeuner ! Super bon et un prix abordable !
