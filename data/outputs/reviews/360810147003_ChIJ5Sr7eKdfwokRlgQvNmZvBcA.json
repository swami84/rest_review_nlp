        "caption": "The place looks good, outdoor seating, proper social distancing spacing with the seats, which is rare to across nowadays. Against my better judgment, I chose this restaurant by those bases alone, and it was a bad choice. The menu looked fancy, so I was expecting high end food, small portions, high prices, but flavors to match. Got the exorbitant prices, the fancy looking food, the small portion size, but almost every dish served had something off about them unfortunately.  Let's start with apps and drinks. Some praise to be given for not overly diluting their sangria, but for $15 for a 32oz drink that much should be expected. It was OK, fruit flavors were lacking, but lots of wine in them. Ordered the calamari, it was pistachio battered and was the best out of all the dishes, but I'm spoiled with Italian restos and their wide plates, so seeing this come in a pathetic oblong excuse for a dish was sad. To top it off, it had jalape\u00f1o chillies scattered, yet it still wasn't stacked higher than the chipotle mayo dip dish it came with. Free chips and guac, chips were crispy but overly salted, guac was delicious though, but I'm more of a creamy blended guac person while their guac was chunks of avocados, which made it hard to scoop up.  Moving on to the main dishes: Lamb was tender, flavorful, not too gamey, and plated on top of an Aloe Vera slab. Looked beautiful, honestly, loved it, except for it being a small cut lasting a few bites and costing as much as a Morton's new york strip. Earned a star, for quality and presentation, but not much else. Was not representative of a Mexican restaurant, but I'd chalk that up to being my fault for ordering braised lamb in a Mexican place.  Forgot the name, but something of a paella, coming at $27 the rice was seasoned well except for having too much salt, the seafood was a mix of mussels, octopus, and others that I barely saw because the portion size was too small. The seafood also wasn't fresh, and the mussels were disappointingly small. Everything in this restaurant was meant for a single connosieur to admire, not to eat.  Lastly was a squid ink rice dish topped with scallops. 3 mini saucers of squid ink rice, way too salty as was the trend with this restaurant, and a scallop had a rock in it. Gorgeously plated and all sitting on top of a creamy sauce, it reminded me of a risotto. Earns a star for plating, but that the aforementioned issues take that star back.  Service: staff was nice, but it took 35 minutes between finishing the appetizer, and getting main dishes, and another 20 minutes for the bill. Place wasn't even packed.  For full transparency's sake, the bill was 150s without tip, so make of that what you will. Also to be completely fair, perhaps I should have tried their tacos and/or quesadillas which may have been their highlighted dishes, however I believe that you menu is only as strong as your weakest dishes.  Overall, a disappointment in Astoria, where you can find so many great places to eat. Gastropubs, bar and restos, dedicated restaurants; they're abundant in this area and amidst this crisis all are competing to survive. This restaurant needs to do better if they want to earn that.",

I love Mexican anyway I can get it, but there's more attention placed here on the overall dining experience. To start, the servers were very welcoming and attentive. The interior's modern decor and low-lighting set the mood nicely. As far as the menu, most of the familiar dishes are served here with a few not-so-common ones. Everything was well portioned, with a neat aesthetic presentation. The food itself was delicious and expertly prepared. My girlfriend and I were especially impressed by the fish - perfectly crispy on the outside, without being dry. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out.",

Everything else was delicious, the crab guac was amazing, the shrimp tacos were super delicious as well. The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is were were the only people there at 8om on a Wednesday which makes the mood really odd, maybe play some music so I don't feel like the waitress and the cook staff can hear every word in saying. Also the chairs are super cheap and uncomfortable, they look cool but not functional. Lastly they still don't have a liquor license, which is a bummer because I want them to do well and stick around because the place looks really cool, the food and service are great. They should allow byob like everyone else who's waiting for a liquor license, they will get way more business.",
