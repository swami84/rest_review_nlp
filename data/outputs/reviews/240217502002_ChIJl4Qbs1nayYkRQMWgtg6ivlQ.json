A little skimpy on the rice and beans. Overall,  for a carryout order, I won't complain.  Thanks, Frank for the recommendation of trying the tres fajitas! Queso and salsa are good too!",

Got tired of waiting and sat down at the table.  Today comes around got the final charges on our credit card. First charge is $18 and the second charge is for $20. Not sure what happened but the bartender must have tipped himself or something. I'm going to call and ask for copies of the merchant receipts and see what's exactly on there.",

She wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu but then again if you have an eighth grade reading level there's no need to really ask her. I got a sampler and the shrimp taco platter. All of the food was on point. And finally most importantlyit past my litmus test of the chips and salsa. The salsa is delicious fresh and a little spicy. Although I was slightly disappointed on the chips I was hoping for a thinner homemade. All in all this place is definitely 5 out of 5 for me even with the minor shortcomings because of how good my dinner was. I highly recommend for any of you Tex Mex \ud83c\udf2e lover's",

Although getting the food took a long time, the waiter kept coming back with waters and making sure everyone had drinks. Although my shrimp tacos were just okay. The tacos were huge and filled me up.

Food came out at a reasonable time frame and was still hot. Ordered the Sampler and for the most part it was good, stuffed jalapenos were over fried though. My first time trying the tamales and they seemed a little dry inside; had al a carte shredded chicken tacos and those were pretty tasty. Overall good experience. I may return a second time to see if the food and service is consistent.",

Anytime I was down on my luck Neel gave me a chance even when I wasn't deserving both Neel and Andrew came through! Not to mention the food is always amazing!

The food and drinks were served quickly despite it being very crowded. I very much enjoyed my margarita and the selection of drink options. And last but not least the food was quite good. I got the tacos \u00e0 la carte. The Carnitas and al Pastor were really good. The only small complaint was the shrimp taco wasn\u2019t my favorite.  Not bad just nothing special. It mostly tasted like just shrimp and cheese and not much else. I would have added a mango coleslaw and cilantro or something. But other than that everything was great and we had a really good time!

I also, had their appetizer size Beef Tamales. What can I say - delicioso (delicious)!  My only  complaint is that on Friday night it's very loud so, it was hard to talk sitting at the bar. It got to the point where we were shouting just to have a conversation. Then again I'm getting older so, maybe my hearing is going.  I did however, like the music when I could hear it. And I'd like to try the Guacamole In Tortilla Shell next time. Maybe I'd even go on a Saturday when they have a D.J. playing Salsa. Except there may be a cover charge. Either way I'll be going back again.",

        "caption": "I made reservations on their website for Friday (last night) that took the number of people which was 6 of us( and 2 out of them drove from West Virginia and Gaithersburg for the special occasion to celebrate promotions and awards) at 6pm for reservations at 830pm. There is only options of 6:30 7:40 and 8:30 for the evening. I choose 830 put in my telephone number and the website said thank you for your request it's been sent. Thought it was odd I didn't get a confirmation. But I still went early at 815pm it was not that busy had a younger female at the desk and explained I made reservations but I was early. She gave me a weird look and said no we don't take reservations. I answered what do you mean you don't take reservations? I filled out the reservation online and it even took my telephone number. She answered back with we don't take reservations on the weekends. Of course I answered back with weekends are Saturday and Sunday's today is Friday and your website took the reservation along with my telephone number and said it has been sent in for the request. She went to go talk to the manager who I saw the gentleman with black hair short with his button down colored blue shirt speaking to her and waving his hands in the air. He never bothered to come out to my friends and I to even apologize or acknowledge the situation. Great management skills and customer service skills right??! The employee walk back and again said the same thing that there was nothing she could do they don't take reservations on the weekend and that if I wanted to wait they would try to find a table for me. Of course I was appalled by this point because I felt the customer service was downright terrible. I train people on customer service and it's a huge thing with the business where I work for and this place definitely needs those skills and the manager on duty totally disappointed me.  I don't know who trained him on his skills but he definitely needs a refresher. This business needs to know they need to acknowledge their faults because no business is perfect a simple apology goes a long way in the world of customer service especially in a food retail place that is geared by customers buying and purchasing things. If Taco Daddy ever needs some customer service training I'll be happy to lend a helping hand in that area because it's clear they need it. I will never return or give a second chance to this facility.",

Prices reflect the rent of the neighborhood,  not the value/quality of its food or atmosphere. Food... Ceviche : No, just NO. Whoever came up with this recipe has never, ever, actually tasted a real ceviche. Ours went back to the kitchen after two bites. Wrong variety of limes, in fact I'd be willing to bet the lime juice came out of a bottle. No other flavors present. Save yourself time and take a swig of the old squeeze bottle of lime juice in the back of your fridge. Guacamole : Lots of avocado and no mayo, good. Few, if any, other spices or ingredients, bad. Needs work. Fajitas: Average. Onions and green bell peppers only, light on the meats. Pricy for the quantity and quality. Drinks: Pi\u00f1a colada out of an artificially flavored mix bottle. Topped with whipped cream? Gross. White wine sangria made with low quality wine, also unpalatable. Bills itself as a neighborhood hangout, but prices are too high for that, and the food is not good enough to make up for it. I didn't go for the Tequila tasting, as more than two makes it impossible to tell the difference.",

But I can\u2019t even explain how excited I was when this came out. I ordered the Al Pastor taco plate for lunch. Hot and fresh, the first thing I noticed was the aroma of spices that came with the plate, perfectly arranged for presentation. The condiments were bursting with flavor, but not so much as to cover up the deliciousness of the meat itself. I opted to not squeeze fresh lime and add salsa so I could truly give an unadulterated review of the taco alone. Oh. My. Goodness! The meat was a perfect balance of juicy and crispy in texture, and the perfectly seasoned meat ensured that every bite was consistent in flavor throughout. The double layer of corn tortillas, the only tortillas that should accompany Al Pastor Tacos, could barely stand up to the amount of meat they packed into each taco. The second I tried with the Salsa Verde and lime. Equally as delicious with the added depth and heat one would hope from that added combination. The best surprise was that they didn\u2019t overlook flavor when it came time to the arroz y frijoles. Perfect texture and expertly seasoned as well truly let me know that they weren\u2019t just added as fillers for the plate, but truly were quality sides to make a rounded meal. The staff were all very friendly and never allowed my drink to remain empty without at least offering to refill it. Will definitely be coming back. Best of Frederick got it wrong this year.",

So I\u2019m more familiar with those style of tacos - basically the best in the world. Taco Daddy needs to step up their tacos, beans and rice. They were just plain. They also charge if you want more chips and salsa. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been charged for something that is a standard for Latin American food.  The margarita I had and the service was just fine. No complaints.  I won\u2019t be back, because I am a major Taco critic. These just were not good at all.",

Firstly I ordered the nachos off of the menu and my wife ordered steak. After a 45-minute wait we got our nachos that seem to just be grated cheese covering flimsy tortilla chips with a dollop of sour cream and the rest of the fixings. It seemed to me that I could have gotten the same quality of nachoes if I microwaved homemade nachos and compared it to this places. It got to me lukewarm and that would be my only dig on this dish.  My wife ordered steak, I forgot if it was the fajitas or something else but it was steak nonetheless, and it came mostly cooked. But to be honest it had the quality of boiled meat, which doesn't sound great but I don't know how else to describe it. The flavor wasn't there, and  the reason why I am posting is because the bill was $30 plus and I feel like I could have gotten better quality somewhere else for less.  the staff here was really friendly and welcoming and made sure my drink was always topped off and that I had everything I needed! Thank you guys for the good customer service.  Just needs improvement on the food, which doesn't reflect the bartenders or waiters.",
