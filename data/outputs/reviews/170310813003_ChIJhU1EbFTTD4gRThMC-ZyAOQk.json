Meals are played with and prepared on a teppan hot plate at each table, where chefs showcase individual skills of the knife as they prepare your selection of five course pan-Asian dinners. The menu ranges from appetizers and sushi to noodles and tofu along with Hibachi Chateaubriand, Hibachi Chicken and an Ocean Treasure (combo of lobster, scallops and shrimp). There is also an array of specialty dinners which are served as a 6 course meal. Desserts are limited to include green tea ice cream, rainbow sherbet and Edy\u2019s ice cream (but note the Cheesecake Factory is right next door!) Note that this location also has excellent lunch offers and combination deals including bento boxes, All in all Benihana is excellent value for money not to mention fairly healthy!",

We got the wrong order for delivery, so I called to let them know and was told I\u2019d have to pay for the changes, which I did. This was at 9:35pm, and I was told by the girl on the phone that it was plenty of time to re-order because they closed at 10:15pm. At 9:46 my order was cancelled by the restaurant and I didn\u2019t get the notification until 10:30 from Uber. When I called to inform them, two of the staff members hung up on me and when I called the third time they never answered. It was a man first and then a woman who claimed to be the manager.  If this is who you have managing your restaurant you need to re-evaluate your life because this is terrible customer service! I get treated better at McDonald\u2019s! This isn\u2019t a value meal we\u2019re buying here, we spent $90 last night for one meal! I\u2019ve worked in customer service my whole life and would NEVER hang up on a customer no matter what and two of your employees did it which shows that the training here sucks! I will NEVER order at this location again.",

I was here a few Saturday ago's and had gotten some takeout on my trip back home and of course I had to personally stop here because I do love their food as you can see from my pics. Right on Michigan Avenue I definitely recommend having a stop here. Especially if you are traveling to Chicago and you love sushi! Whether you are having a party or stopping down for dinner this would be a great place to check out with them preparing the food right at your table and doing all the flips and what not its great to eat and watch while you are at it. So for me I definitely give them my personal 5 star review and add them to the list that is at the top of the rest for the places that I personally have been able to make an appearance at. The staff is friendly and even in busy times they do things with excellent service with a smile. I can guarantee if you'll make an appearance here you'll enjoy what Benihana has to offer. I'm the Chicago Rican Richlatino (Rich Hearted Latino) that speaks Spanglish not Spanish and if you want a 5 star type review then look no further than me, myself, and I. Boom!",

Overall, it was a typical hibachi experience. Only improvement would be for cooks to start cooking a little faster. We sat at the grill for a little while before the chef came and started cooking.",

It was fine that the tables were reservation only(although they all looked fairly empty to be reserved at the time we were there) so we had to sit in the general area. We ordered our food and as we start to even eat the food, my bestfriend pulls out a long ash blonde hair out of her mouth as she\u2019s chewing the first bite. We immediate told the waiter and he asked did he want us to do anything about it, or did we want some ice cream- we said we didn\u2019t want another plate we don\u2019t want it. We both ate about 2 bites and even with the hair decided the food was not good and had no seasoning. He brought the check and the total was as though we ate a whole meal, he came back and said I asked did y\u2019all want me to do anything. So at the point we were really over it, the manager came over looking like she did not want to assist and when we told her about it she looked at her staff like well couldn\u2019t be my people - so unprofessional. She took off my bestfriends meal so I paid for everything else And even tipped the guy $20 - even though I didn\u2019t eat it. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with that woman however, I know they need some professional courtesy courses and how to handle unsatisfied customers. They easily could\u2019ve kept 2 customers because I like to spend money and eat.",

I actually ended up not finishing it. The rest of the meal was pretty good! Just really bummed that we all paid quite a bit extra for low quality fried rice and the bowls weren't even filled all the way (at most 2/3). The guy working up front didn't seem like he was happy to be there at all so that was a bad first impression right after walking in. Over all okay one time experience but I wouldn't go back there. I would recommend checking out Sakura hibachi on diversy instead.",

Two- I had modified my reservations minutes in advance since the girls at the front desk didn\u2019t want to answer the phone and the girl made it such a hassle for me to be seated. It took the cook 1 hour and 25 mins to come out. Our waiter was rushing us and was not attentive or around at all. The chef was great tho! Our food was okay but we ate so late so by the time the food was ready I was completely annoyed. The waiter also messed up our checks and my husband food. Smh never again. First time at Benihana and now my last! Terrible restaurant, just go to SAKURA! It\u2019s way better !",

Some people from our party were very late unfortunately, but they still made room for us when they finally arrived, which was nice, but they refuse to seat you without your whole party, just be aware of that. The food was pretty good and our chef was really nice, but if going for dinner, there's basically nothing under 20 dollars per person unless you get sushi. The lunch menu had some great deals, but dinner was the same menu, double the price, which is always kind of depressing to see. Overall decent, a good night out with a group.",

Nobody came to offer help or to apologize. After we got all upset and were making faces the server came and asked if we wanted the club soda.

We all chose fried rice, but the waiter didn't tell us that there was an extra charge of $5+ per person. After a dispute, they removed it from the bill. But I think it's wrong to offer a choice without communicating that it's considered an upgrade which changes the total price by 20%! Another party at our table was also upset over the same issue.",

The waitress was nice but the chef was rude, didn\u2019t do any tricks, prepared salty rice and left the grill unannounced to return a few minutes later with no explanation or apology. It was a slow night and we only had 3 people in our party so there were many empty seats beside us where they would usually put another party.  The manager came over to us and explained that usually if you don\u2019t order large entrees the chef won\u2019t come out to prepare the food. My friends and I are not heavy meat eaters so we only ordered rice and noodles. The manager continues to explain that the chefs make more in tips when there are more people ordering large entrees.  I explained to the manager that it\u2019s not our fault that it\u2019s a slow night for them and if there was an issue with us not ordering enough for a chef to come out then that could\u2019ve been explained to us by the waiter as we were ordering. Nevertheless the chef came out begrudgingly  and prepared our food.  The entire experience was very uncomfortable.",

The pick was perfect because we had a large group with 8 people, and we were all seated comfortably around the teppanyaki table.  I got the hibachi steak and salmon to share with one other person, and it was so fun watching the protein, veggies, and fried rice get made. But to be honest, I thought the main course tasted just okay. The steak tasted just a bit overcooked while the salmon was way undercooked for medium rare so I had to ask the chef to leave it on the grill longer. And while I was full, I thought I'd be stuffed by the end of the meal.  Nonetheless, my friends and I had a good time and I'd come back with another large party for a special occasion.  PS. I had wanted to use the $30 birthday coupon, but realized you had to get it way in advance. According to their website, they only email the coupon out once a week on Wednesdays. So if you want to get the coupon, just remember to claim it/check your email at least a week before and print it out.",

The main reason I didn't like it is because I have a shrimp allergy and although there are vents that supposed to suck all the smoke/fumes from the cooking surface, I had trouble breathing and spend most of the time outside of the restaurant. The food, in my opinion, wasn't that good (except the filet mignon that was excellent) and the portions were too small (I was still hungry when we left the restaurant).",

So after that experience of not so great service I still gave him a $5 tip to add to the price of $65.86 which brought the total to $70.86.  So to my surprise this morning I wake up and check my account and this establishment charged me $136.72. Totally unacceptable. So I call and ask for management and spoke to Brittany who wasn't apologetic at all. I literally had to tell her how to conduct proper customer service in a matter of fraudulent activity. I can't believe  this type of practices are acceptable with this restaurant establishment. I will never dine here again and advise everyone to double check your purchase. Fwd: 2 weeks ago called to follow up about a credit and spoke to the manager Grace who was also unapologetic and had no \"record\" of the issue. So I told her about the email etc.. and she still wouldn't help. So made a tweet regarding this issue and was lied to and never received a call back. So today I finally was able to get in touch with corporate which was a joke because I had to leave a vm. So around 6 ish today the general manager called (Mark) stating corporate sent a email for him to handle. Funny thing is Grace is his manager. So I explained the story again for him to attempt to try to help but needed my card information. I was out when he called but told him that I would call once I got home. Now I'm on the phone with Mark who is very condescending but he was able to finally search through the records and BOOM he found it. Which is interesting because his boss Grace said there wasn't any records. Hmmm... lesson don't trust this company, very shady, horrible customer service, horrible management service, horrible corporate service and to think it's in a prime area downtown Chicago!!!",

Food portions were extremely small for the price we paid. Not to mention they over cooked our steak. I do not recommend anyone to ever go to the Benihana on Michigan Ave. You will be disappointed.",

I don\u2019t think they liked the fact that there were 16 people with us or what but they rushed with cooking the food, they made us all purchase separate orders of stir fried rice instead of making our white rice fried rice like we were used to them doing. When asked for extra items like onions and tomatoes, they were not pleased which I don\u2019t understand because if it cost extra then that\u2019s something that should have been said instead of being rude saying \u201cit has to be enough for everyone.\u201d They were rushing us to leave like as soon as the cook gave the last person their food about 5 minutes or less later they were coming with carry out trays. I just think that since they told us that 18% gratuity would automatically be included on our bill, that they didn\u2019t need to make our experience enjoyable. I will make this experience known to the public.",

Water glasses were sat before us, then nothing. Nothing for like twenty minutes. You do wait for a seat before you are sat so some of the other guests who were sharing our table and grill were curious as to if there was an issue but it was a pattern. After soup and salad we waited another twenty minutes. Between cooking rice our chef lost track of plates and we sat for five minutes as the rice sat idly by room tempurature vegetables. The problem is hibachi style dinners has to be timed. And Valentines night  historically crowds restaurants. Our food was cold in the end and for some reason the chef was chopping my shrimp completely and splitting it amongst everyone else. I got one of four servings made from ten shrimp. This was really discouraging. Especially when we chose to eat here in celebration of a holiday. I paid $48.00 for one plate. It was two of us. We were sat at 9:05 and didn\u2019t eat until 10:50pm. I asked for a to-go plate and never touched the food.",

When you walk in the front door you get hit by all of the smoke an grease from the grills. I know that there is a bit of this smell at all locations, but this one is the most overwhelming I've experienced. Once I start to walk back to the table my eyes even water from the thickness of the air. I realize that this is in the basement of a skyscraper, but they really need to figure out how to clear out the air.

I have listed items below in the order of their importance (for me). 1.) Sanitation. The bathroom was so filthy that our feet stuck to the floor upon entering not to mention the mess. When we were seated, the grill had leftover food from the previous group and had to be cleaned before us, but it wasn\u2019t fully clean even when they began cooking. The area between the two grills were also filthy. The grills themself were never fully clean either. Other hibachi restaraunts we have been to fully clean the grills  to where there is no food residue leftover, but that was not the case here. 2.) Customer Service. Our server, Danielle, was clearly untrained. We had to repeat our order multiple times to multiple people due to misunderstandings or a simple lack of listening. Some members of our party ordered both soup and salad, but there was confusion even about something as simple as that. Our waters often went unfilled and our waitress blamed another waiter for her responsibilities. Furthermore, we went for my brothers birthday and it was completely ignored. Our chef was not entertaining and simply cooked the food half-heartedly. 3.) Portion sizes and food quality. For the prices, the food portions are quite small and not fresh. While the chicken was good and steak and shrimp equally as good, the salad was very disappointing. The lettuce was brown - one bowl so brown a family member didn\u2019t feel comfortable eating it. Other places I have been use fresh ingredients, but I felt Benihana cut corners by using bagged and old food.  Very unprofessional.",

The ventilation was very poor and my eyes and nose burned the entire meal.  My daughter had to get up multiple times to blow her nose and complained that her eyes hurt.  We should have said something before we left, but we were with another family and didn't want them to think we hadn't enjoyed their company.",

I remember that feeling of enjoying the food while watching a funny kinda show of it being cooked. Last night for me was a disappointment, for couple of reasons. We were a party of 3, I planned a special night with my boyfriend and my brother, who had just met, and my boyfriend who never been to an hibachi before. I made reservations for 8pm. Honestly, the fact that we were waiting for like 30 for the rest of the table to show up proves that making reservations are not necessary. Our waitress was wonderful! She literally won the only star for this restaurant. Let me get it straight, I saw the reviews of the place getting worse and worse but I also seen the comments from the manager saying they are working on getting it back up. The appetizer- we got 2 tampura vegetables and one spicy tuna, it was great! Drinks- they had cranberry something that they loves. I had a soda :) Entree's- we had 3 filet mignon. It was good, small portion.  The show- very boring! I could hear a table behind us laughing there heart out but our table was as quite as in a memorial ceremony. The cook looked tired and out of place, and don't get me wrong, the place wasn't full, it's dinner time, not close to closing and every other reason I could thing of for him to be that sad. He did give a bit much attention to one of the guests, we couldn't figure out why, but he seems to get more food and took a small part of his show. My boyfriend couldn't understand what we were so excited about since for him it was nothing special.  Bottom line, I ended up paying $180 for poor show, poor portions and unpleasant experience. I'm sure we were better of spending the night in a different place for better experience.",

I must say, i was not impressed. The establishment was fairly clean. However, I did feel as there was no professionalism from the staff. We were served by European woman, who was slow and evidently carried an attitude every time we would order something or inquire about an item on the menu, considering it was our first time. It made us feel extremely unwelcomed. Will definitely be sharing my experience on my blog, and will say that it is not worth it considering how pricey it is. Do not want to think of it as racial discrimination, although that waitress clearly did not act the same towards other customers of the restaurant.",

When the Chef first started distributing appetizes, he kindly pointed out to me that there was a hair on my plate. I left my silverware on the plate as the waitress took the plate with the hair. Soon after, when the food was being distributed, i called our waitress as she was walking by to request another set of silverware, to which she turned around with a huge sigh and rolled her eyes before walking over to me. This was noted by my entire party which we did not appreciate one bit. Although we are from Florida, we made it a priority to visit this restaurant as we were told about the quality of food and service. Would not recommend to any friends or family visiting Chicago after this experience.",

I liked the entrance salad. Vierias and shrimps that we ordered were perfectly cooked. Rice was also very delicous. Erick is Mexican and He learn to dominate the performance. We even saw a Chinese Jeff cooking next table. He was literaly a disaster. If I had had him, I would had left.  Eric made the difference and we thank him for the great service and lunch. Staff was nice and prices were affordable. 100% recommended.",
