As the years went by and I moved out of the Bronx and I traveled from one end of America to the other.  Still having family around the corner. I always tried to stop by and eat a slice or 2.  Most of the time, I would order a pie and take my time eating it.  While the pizza was ok, it was'nt what I remembered.  A slice went from.25 cents to just under $3.00.  I also saw the Bronx Burn down, and rise from the ashes.  In the mean time this pizza place changed hands, I always stopped back and spoke to the guys that worked there.  In all of the years the place got darker and darker,with random drug sales out front and once or twice I witnessed a drug sale in the place while trying to finish my slice.  As far as the last owners, they did thier best to keep that outside.  But still the pizza was far better than most of the .99 cent pizza around the corner.  Just recently there are some new owners, they dont know the folks who live here.  When I am around, I try and stop by and either get a pie ir a slice or 2.  The last few times that I have stoped, the bottom of the whole pie was burnt and the last slice gave me horrible heart burn.  Yesterday, was the last straw, There was a new guy behind the counter, not wearing a mask or gloves, the person who was touching all of the pizza was not only not wearing gloves, but neither of the 2 people in the front had mask or gloves on.  When I asked them to please put on masks and gloves, the Knuckel head behind the counter got verbal as well as nasty.  I had to tell him to lower his voice when he talks to me. I told him that not only was I never ever going to step foot in there but that I was going to call the health dept on them.  His response was go ahead. Which believe me I did.  As I was leaving I noticed that there was no Letter Grading in The window.  No A, No B, No C, or even A Grade pending.  Which dont get me wrong, but its my understanding that this is a must for each and any food service place in all 5 boros.  The only thing that I can think of is that, the new owners fell that they can serve Black and Latino people garbage and dont have to follow and type of rules.  I\"ll never ever step foot in there again and neither should you.  If you want a real NYC pizza place, drive, walk, up to Arthur Ave and stop by  Full Moon Pizza.  Best Pizza in the Bronx, wonderful owners, Clean,bathrooms, and decent prices.  Also please tell them Chef Eddie said hello.",
