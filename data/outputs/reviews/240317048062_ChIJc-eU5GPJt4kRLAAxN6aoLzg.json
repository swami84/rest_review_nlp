I order it every single time and I get the large and I eat it on its own, as an entree. It is delicious! Oh, their onion rings are the bomb! Dip it in the spicy bbq sauce and your eyes might roll into the back of your head from the joy you will feel. This is definitely a place you need to be trying.",

We had a complete meal and everything was really good I recommend going here for dinner on one of those days when you really want barbecue or if you can't decide what to eat try this place. I'm told they deliver. 2. Here's my in-depth review we really enjoyed our meal and I'll try to attach the pictures The onion rings were cooked perfectly, when you bite through it you bite through it including the onion. Oh by the way they taste really good too. Pulled pork was was so good that I almost couldn't stop eating my pork sandwiches to take a drink. I literally had to think about putting my sandwich down to get a drink and stop myself from just consuming this terrific barbecue sandwich. At this point I also had a chance to try the side of slaw that comes with everything I'm told. Different and tasty and certainly the chef's owned seasonings in this slaw. The sandwich was so good I had to try the ribs. Oh my God so meaty maybe the meatiest I've had. Very nice house flavor barbecue sauce tops the ribs. They're also bottles of the sweeter sauce and hot sauce that you choose between when you order your ribs. I got the scalloped potatoes as my side. A mistake, I personally do not consider really nice mashed potatoes with cheese melted across the top of them in their bowl scalloped potatoes. They were mashed potatoes with skins with cheese on top. My dining partner wisely chose the waffle sweet potatoe fries. They stayed hot at the plate unlike usual sweet potato fries. These waffle sweet potato fries State hot the entire time they were cooked really well and that have wonderfully fresh taste to them",

The lamb platter contained just enough to cover my open palm.  The 20 dollar half rack, while tasty according to my guest, was shockingly small.  My pulled pork bbq  sandwich  was similarly inadequate for the price, but worse was that it was a gooey composite of who knows what.  The mac and cheese side used the new Kraft tasteless cheddar.  My order for large fries was not even in the bag.  The corn bread was 1 square inch.  Crowning this was the cole slaw serving for the $20 rack was in a tiny plastic cup that held exactly on tablespoon.  Some things are just wrong!",

The brisket was just insultingly bad. It was chewy, over salted, over cooked, and reminded me of something I might get from the lunch ladies in grade school. The ribs had no smoke flavor, with absolutely no smoke ring and were dry and overcooked, with a typical bbq sauce smother job to cover the lazy cooking. The service was great and the place had a cool vibe, but I just cant get over how bad the meats were. Just terrible.",

Fried pickles were also very good, as was the accompanying horseradish sauce. Scalloped potatoes looked really good, but over-spiced with something, maybe thyme? Didn't really like the dish because of this. \"Smoke\" was there in the food, for me at just the right amount - the 'smoke\" did not overwhelm the food like some other places do.

Sauce was needed to provide flavor to all of the meat.  My advice as a Q aficionado...more rub and lots more smoke.  On the plus side the coleslaw and greens were very good.",

Meager portion of brisket was uniformly limp and grey with no sign of pink and the au jus they insist on slathering over it ruined what would have been at best a mediocre sandwich.  Pulled pork and pulled chicken were tasteless and bland.  Sauces uninspired, particularly what they call North Carolina BBQ.  The potato salad was nice  - creamy and fresh with bacon bits and no sign of sweetness it but it wasn't enough to save an overpriced and underwhelming meal.  The service is surly and slow.  Red Hot and Blue is still a better bet - cheaper and better.",

I could have eaten a healthy portion of it beyond the small amount that came with the sandwich. I had the mac and cheese as a side and it was also good. I definitely want to come back, perhaps for a BBQ platter for takeaway.",
