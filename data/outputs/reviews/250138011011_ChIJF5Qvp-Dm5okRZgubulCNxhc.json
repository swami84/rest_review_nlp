All the food that I tried was delicious and Keri and his wife were always nice, warm and friendly. After a short time, they learned which condiments I liked with my food and which ones I rather not have. They never forgot about these preferences and that made my experience of going there very joyful and fast. Once I got married, they had the same attentive behavior towards my wife.  We moved back to Costa Rica but, we still miss the great food that we enjoyed there and , especially the kindness with which they always treated us.",

Open for lunch and located in the Tower Square, the prices are very reasonable and they only accept cash but there are multiple bank ATMs in the building. The wonderful family that owns the restaurant is from Crete and the food is as authentic as you can get in the United States. There menu is broad but my go to is the gyro. The meat is delicious, the pita is airy and soft, the vegetables clean and fresh. They prepare the food in front of you and are great with customizing the meal as you\u2019d like it, giving generous portions that fill the entire pita. Don\u2019t skip dessert, the almond cookies are homemade and the baklava is delicious!",
