It's a nice bar area, but overpriced and the service can be hit or miss even when not busy. The pours are okay and come in a plastic cup with a hard stop line of where to pour. It keeps it consistent, but I just prefer a glass instead.  I'd just rather hit up one of the other bars while here. Just not my first pick.",
