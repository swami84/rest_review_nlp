During the pandemic, I'm surprised they stay afloat but I can see why they do. Best sushi I've had in years. Restaurant was clean but a little cluttered towards the kitchen but couldn't tell what exactly it was. I would only suggest to not have an actual lobster in the roll. Somebody could make an expensive mistake on eating it plus it took away 2 rolls which was disappointing. I will be back to try the rest of the menu",

To make long story short, my wife had very bad diarrhea, I spent in a bathroom until midnight, diarrhea, vomiting guts out. Wanted to go emergency room but realized, in a city hospital it\u2019s gonna be 5 h , before somebody will see me. Next day I called the restaurant , tried to explain the situation, after 20 min the lady, asked me you lost credit card or wallet, total miscommunication. After calls to Restoran owner, I was told, next time we ll get 20% discount with photo ID and proof of citizenship, I added. Anyway go this place on your own risk, may be good or may be not.

The freshness of sashimi was ultra-good and their sushi rice is thin and very tasty. Their price for all their foods including appetizer is very reasonable. On the top of that it is BYOB at this time . You can bring anything you like and they will serve with iced can and glasses. First time we visited we ordered a lot because we wanted to try variety foods and see it is worth it come back from northside of Chicago. We ordered jalapeno sashimi which was outstanding and so pretty presentation, seaweed salad which is huge portion, shrimp tempura which is so crispy and clean taste, and Tonkatus ramen. I was surprised and pleased of their Tonkotus Ramen. They know how to make the soup base and flavor and it was not pricy at all like other Japanese noodle places. We also ordered various rolls, Dragon maki, Godzilla maki, and White sox (my favorite). All of them has a great combination of taste and nice decoration. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family who want casual, but fancy and satisfied experience in sushi place. Oh, it is easy to park and easy to walk from red line stop.",

Our waiter was very helpful and answered many questions. I had Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) with shrimp. This was to an extent a rookie mistake. I should have taken the waiters advice and gotten the pork belly. My son did and I believe made the dish better than with the shrimp. Everything was so delicious regardless.  Make during to try the mochi for desert.",
