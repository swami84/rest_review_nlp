Be aware before going to this place if you want to be treated like a human being. Will never ever going there or even want to spend my money at this place.",

Wow, I\u2019d stay away. Busy or dead the bartenders ignore you. Talk to each other behind the bar and make you wait or hitting on someone sitting down at the bar and can\u2019t take time out of their conversation to tend to others. They\u2019re very rude and act like they\u2019re gods gift to bartending. After a horrible experience one night and never in my life being spoken to the way one of the younger girl bartenders spoke to me. The next night was over charged $35 separately from my bill after I left, called the next morning around 12 spoke to someone said I\u2019d be getting a call back in a couple hours. Didn\u2019t hear anything all day called around 5 and the manager who answered the phone shandra told me \u201cshe did what she was suppose to do\u201d and id be getting a call back maybe the next day. If I ever said that to a customer I would no longer have a job, clearly do not care remotely at all. Within the first 5-6 days of moving into the apartment above I\u2019ve spent over $500 and I\u2019ll probably never be back. With all the places to go eat and that are hurting for business I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty places with a way more friendly staff and better service.",

I am a very patient person and continued to wait till she was done talking to her friend who was just standing there. I was disappointed that service was that bad with just 2 people and on top of that didn't care that I walked out because I got tired of waiting 30 min not even to be greeted. Not sure who owns this place but customers will continue to walk with this type of treatment. It's too bad because I actually liked food. Gave this place 2 stars for solely on my food experience.

But then tonight we came again after recommending the place and came with a group of people; had a wonderful and friendly sever who was new. You could tell she was not trained well enough to help a Group of 15 people. My order was one of the first orders taken which was a salad with avocado added and it came out last; all other hot meals came out first. When the bill came and our new server needed help she struggled with separating the bill. Checks were messed up and we had to take the time to tell her what was on our bills. It\u2019s Kinda of pathetic that a manager couldn\u2019t properly take the time to train this young lady the way she deserves! Many of us at this table are in the service industry,  and we fully understand the struggle. The server was wonderful: patient, kind, friendly and very personable but the management should have trained her better and worked with her to fully execute this evening on a better note. Rather than struggling to get through one table successfully. I\u2019d recommend this server again but not this restaurant if it performs like this!!!!  Thank you Andrea, you did wonderful for not being trained well enough. Our group appreciated your patience and friendliness!!!",

From the moment we walked in the door, not knowing if we should seat ourselves or wait to be led to our table. Nobody seemed to notice when we walked in the door, so we just sat ourselves. A few minutes later our waitress, who's name begins with \"A\" treated us as if we were the last people she wanted to deal with that night. Im not really sure why. Drinks took forever, the food, took forever and our waitress was never anywhere to be found. When she did come by our table she was aloof and seemed genuinely put out for having to deal with us. We had to twice go up to the bar to ask someone to get our waitress. We weren't being overly needy, i assure you. We simply wanted things like silverware and our drinks ordered 15 minutes earlier. Maybe it was a bad night for District Tavern. Maybe \"A\" was having a bad night. I don't know, but i i  know that I along with the other people in my party wont be coming back.",

The lettuce wrap was only 2 slices of wilted lettuce, one on the top and bottom, they gave me a tiny sliver of avocado and it was an extra $2 for that topping and I didn\u2019t get the mayonnaise either.  The burger was supposed to come with their house made blue cheese spread and nothing was on it. Came with a side salad with balsamic blue cheese dressing; the dressing tasted really good. All and all not a bad meal, just need to pay more attention to their menu ingredients and customers orders.",

I also asked for the wings to be crispy and they were not. I called and Steven answered the phone and would not give me the Managers phone number and said he did not know what the Managers name was or when they will be in. Nick got on the line and was absolutely rude and disrespectful and to top it off he hung up on me. I will not be patronizing this business ever again because the food is not cheap and to be treated like I was nothing after they messed up is the ultimate disrespect. Go somewhere else if you want good food and good people. Update: The manager Michael emailed me and restored my faith in the restaurant. This is not about the food that was replaced and delicious but the fact that they apologized for the inconvenience and meant it. Thanks District Tavern.",

It's not big and fancy but located next door to a dog park so we enjoyed watching all the dogs being walked in the area. You could tell it was a neighborhood hangout and they support the local sports team.  We went in around 3pm on a Monday afternoon. The entire place was very quiet and there were not many people in the restaurant. My husband ordered the mild chicken wings. They came out well cooked and the sauce was good. His feedback was the sauce had more heat to it then they server let on to so he wished she would have been a little more clear on the heat level and that the celery on the plate look like it has been cut into three pieces from a normal cut in order to save a few bucks.  My mother ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with fries. She enjoyed it very much.  I ordered the DT nachos. Love the flavor overall but I wish the nachos were layered - all of the toppings were on top so after eating the top layer - it was just chips underneath. I also think the onion needs to be diced - the chunks were just a bit much given the lack of layering.",

Tavern Shooters: 3/5. I thought this was going to be my favorite item, but it was my least favorite. I will say the tomato soup was very good, but the grilled cheeses had almost no flavor and were not cheesy or crispy as expected. Also, the bread ratio was totally off. Skip these.  Mozzarella Balls: 4/5. Very solid take on mozzarella sticks. The insides were actually very soft and not as crunchy as a traditional mozzarella stick is, so I really enjoyed them.  Washington Park Pretzel: 4/5. What can I say, I love a good pretzel. Anytime a pretzel is on the menu, you can bet I'm ordering it. The pretzel was very good, not as great as WOB's but a very solid choice. The cheese dip was delicious, however the mustard was way too overpowering and strong on the pretzel.  Beer Battered Onion Rings: 5/5. I am actually surprised that this was our favorite item we ordered. The batter on the onion rings was ridiculously light and fluffy but still so crunchy at the same time. I'd order these again and again.  Fredo Flatbread: 4/5. The flatbread was perfectly crispy and had a great combination of flavors between the spinach, bacon, and Alfredo sauce. My only complaint is that I wish it had more bacon, I couldn't stop gobbling it up. You can add chicken to this as well.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal. They're not in the best location, but if I'm ever over in Channelside I'd definitely stop in!",

Examples: ordering Stoli vodka and being charged 14.00 for the Elit Stoli...how many people actually know that Elit exists.  Ordering a meal and replacing the fries for broccoli...a 3.00 upcharge.

It took another 5 minutes to receive menus. 5 more minutes and a reassurance trivia was happening, it was 8:05, trivia was suppose to start at 8.  Came specifically for trivia tonight. We called before hand to make sure because it was 4th of July and were told it was happening.  After we order two beers that came in bottles, we waited another 10 minutes before we left. I understand the trivia is run by another company, but the lack of service for two beers is not what I expected. Next holiday, staff your restaurant accordingly and update your staff on changes in the weekly schedule. I was very dissatisfied and disappointed due to the lack of communication between managers and staff.",

This place could have a serious speakeasy feel if they just dimmed the lights waaay down. When you ask them to do this, they act like its such a huge effort. 2. Get the NHL, NFL  College football games pre-programmed in so you don't have to interrupt the bartender from updating their Facebook status. 3. Act like you are genuinely interested when a customer sits at your bar. Smile. Be patient  and helpfully guide them towards some of the tasty beer and menu selections. Don't act so stuck up...you guys ain't that cool.",
