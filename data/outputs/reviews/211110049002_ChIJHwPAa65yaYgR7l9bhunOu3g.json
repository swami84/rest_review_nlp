He knew the history of the hotel and  had several interesting stories.   Arnold, for lack of a better term, \"table attendant\" was excellent.  He has been at the restaurant for over 25 years.  I appreciated his dedication and his pleasant service.  We had the lobster bisque which was excellent, the catch of the day which was sea bass (cooked perfectly) with risotto and I added the lobster tail.  We had shrimp & grits as an app and it was excellent. My wife had the filet with asparagus and she really enjoyed it.  I highly recommend the restaurant.  Thank you Kelly, thank you Arnold.

Needless to say I picked the restaurant because it looked classy from the images, and the menu items I saw looked amazing - I just knew this place would be perfect. I totally had my heart set on their roast duck, and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert.  I live in Washington, DC and flew here to Louisville so that we could have a romantic week/end together.  Anyway, we went through the restaurant website that redirected us to OpenTable to make our reservations.  When we got there we were super excited to order and begin our first V-Day together.  And then I glanced down at my plate and saw a neatly folded, decorated card and no signs of a full menu.  I knew what it meant before I even opened it, and to my utter disappointment, I was confirmed in my assumption: a pre fixe menu (they only have one option. You don\u2019t get to pick your meal - they have picked it for you and do not allow any alterations or substitutions. You\u2019re stuck with whatever the chef came up with for that night).  My heart literally dropped.  It wouldn\u2019t have come as such a blow if we\u2019d known this in advance.  But the restaurant had been advertising their FULL MENU everywhere!!  There was no ad or notice warning patrons that there would be a fixed menu that night, as is customary when serving pre fixe for obvious reasons). My boyfriend was prepared for the cost of dining at this particular restaurant, but he also wasn\u2019t willing to pay $100/plate for food we barely wanted - certainly nothing I had had my heart set on for weeks.  Ugh, it was so disappointing it was crushing. Evening totally ruined.  Our reservations were for 9:45pm, so by the time we realized this discrepancy and began looking for an alternative, almost everything else within reach was closing or not accepting walk-ins.  We ended up having to order burritos from some rinky little joint on the way back, dressed in semi-formal clothes which made it obvious to people that we either missed our reservations or had some issue with our original plans.  I mean, decked out to the nines in a burrito shack!  I felt so humiliated, glad we ordered our food to go so people wouldn\u2019t look at me and think I was out with a guy who would take me out to essentially a fast food restaurant for Valentine\u2019s.  So, they get one star for effectively ruining my first Valentine\u2019s Day with my boyfriend with piss-poor advertisement.",

A symphony of flavors danced upon my tongue during every bite. But it didn't stop there... The service was excellent.

He described the sweet potato soup so well that we had to try it.  We thought that it was very tasty, however we weren't quite prepared for the cayane pepper that gave it a very spicy kick. It was a little too much for my wife to handle, even though she really enjoyed the soup overall. She ordered that salmon and was very impressed by it. I had come intending to try the famous hot brown. The dish was so hot that I couldn't take a bite for several minutes. The bacon and turkey was good, however the gravy and cheese overwhelmed me. I usually clean my plate, but I had to stop with several bites left on the plate. We enjoyed ourselves, and we were glad we came, however we will probably try something different next time.",
