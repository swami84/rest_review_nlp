I came to NSV and have been addicted ever since. Mind you I love in Florida lol. My addiction is soooooo bad even when my husband goes to visit family in NY he always stops by and picks me up a big order of NSV. The food is amazing as well as the staff. Especially the owner, I have Dmed her on IG always letting her know how delicious the food is. I will be in NY next week and this will be my 1st and last stops! Cant wait!",

One thing that stands out about Next Stop Vegan - is what they do for their community.  I have watched Blenlly of NSV participate in free virtual programs where she shares some of her free plant based recipes.  The NSV store is home to the Little Free Library, where the kids that stop by can participate in a free library/book program.  Finally, I have recently started a low-waste journey.  When I put in order notes asking for no plastic utensils or no plastic containers, most restaurants ignore me.  Not Next Stop Vegan!  They have actually gone out of their way to repackage my food using foil and no plastic wraps!  If it is not possible, they let me know and explain why - which is appreciated.  I truly appreciate their care and concern and attention to detail and order notes!!  :-).",

My number one favorite is the Nachos and Pastelitos Yaroa and the Chimi sauce. The Patecon and Vegan Chimi are a delight. My son said Bllengy and her sister make that Quinoa taste like meat for him and he is a critic. He is in love. My friend and her fiance love it as well. My mom is impressed and now wants to be vegan. I also love the Juny salad! Hi Juny. The customer service is awesome wonderful family they know how to make a girl palate feel good.  Fan for life thank you Next Stop Vegan for coming to the Bronx.",

I went with my friend about 3 weeks ago and he wanted to try the food out. He had the patacon and I had Juny's salad and the yaroa pastelito. OMG, it was amazing!! NSV NEVER fails. I need to go back and try other dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE, not just those who are vegan. My friend is not vegan (yet) and he was highly expressed. Thank you, NSV!!",

One Stop Vegan has helped me along the way with its Dominican flavor that are so well infused into the \u201cmeat\u201d of the dish.  One of my favorite dishes is the Juni Salad! Light refreshing and healthy! With a sprinkle of cranberries that top off the salad zest.  Another dish to explore for its flavor is Yaroa. Flavorful combination of your Caribbean sauces layered in with the \u201cmeat\u201d and \u201ccheese\u201d mixed in with a delight of spices that will have you coming for me!",

I go just about every weekend and always get that weekend\u2019s special (or two, or more) and a regular menu item. There is a wait time because everything is made to order but it\u2019s worth it. Just call and order for pick up if you\u2019re in a rush. I think my favorite staple items are the truffle burger and the mofonguitos. The specials are always good. And of course, you gotta get one of their natural fruit juices (limonada, tamarindo or chinola). If they were open more often, I\u2019d be broke. Oh, and don\u2019t forget their meal prep service. Yes, I\u2019ve done that too and it never disappoints. There aren\u2019t enough words to say how great this place is. Well, I guess I just tried using most of them but it\u2019s all well-deserved.",
