The mozzarella had a consistency of cottage cheese with an odd aftertaste, the pepperoni looked like it was put on the pizza after cooking, and the crust had gummy consistency in different spots, plus had that uncooked wheat flavor to it. I had one piece as-is and even though the pizzeria is 3 blocks away, the pizza was lukewarm, and not worth eating in that state. The rest of the pizza hot the oven and was marginally better being cooked. I had a second piece from the reheated pizza. The cheese still tasted funny and the pepperoni never did get crispy on the edges at all. I put a piece I had already repeated back in the broiler and tried to get the pepperoni closer to not tasting like it was out of a Hormel sliced pepperoni package at the grocery. Ended up burning the crust before the rest of the pizza was heated through. Gave the second half of the pizza (that I hadn't reheated yet) to my neighbor in the building. Had my leftover Indian food from yesterday instead.  I asked for extra napkins and got - wait for it - *zero* napkins. I put a tip on the bill when I ordered, against my better judgement. Delivery guy must have thought it didn't really matter about if he brought what I asked or not, since his tip was in the total already.  Little Italy is in the neighborhood and has far superior pizza to La Vera, and La Vera isn't remotely in the ballpark of Patsy's Pizza (any location.) All of those \"pizza lovers\" leaving these glowing reviews must be from Cleveland and have no f#*king idea what decent pizza in NYC is supposed to taste like. If any of them *are* from NYC, maybe a reeducation with what good food is should be in store for them. I hear Papa Johns wants your business.  Would *not* order again from this pizzeria.",

Too bad, because the seating area is fine, and the slice has a good sauce and good helping of cheese, but the dough is awful. Just a chewy, stretchy mess. For dopes who don't know there are other places to go in the area.",
