The bartender downstairs (with the drum & bass) refused to serve us for 45 minutes, until the bar shut down at 1:30 am.  I tried everything. I tried making eye contact. I tried waving. I took out my wallet and held money in my hand, but there was no relief in the form of alcohol. We watched helplessly as he served everyone else multiple times and he was flirting with the other (male) customers. He would not even make eye contact with us.  When we stated the fact that he served everyone else twice before he served us once, he did not apologize and he simply said \"That doesn't make me happy.\"  We were two clean and well-dressed Asians. I believe he discriminated against us because we are Asian. I gave him $20 for $16 of drinks and told him to keep the change because I don't want him discriminating against Asians in the future.",

We actually sort of stumbled on the club after eating at Furious Spoon, but we instantly hit it off with one of the bartenders, Matt.  He was poking fun at us for being there so early. Turns out, it was one of the owners and he immediately made us feel extremely welcome by giving us a tour, taking our coats and offering us a reserved table. Best bar/club we visited!  I wish we could have come back after visiting another club, but one of the girls with us was too intoxicated. :( Definitely will be back to visit on our next trip!  THANK YOU, MATT!",

I'm sitting here at 11:15pm and there is a total of 8 people here. On top of all that, there isn't anything on draft. The can selection is simple and basic. First time coming here and will definitely be the last.  Update: it's 11:40pm and the burlesque has still yet to start. Honestly, it's sad. Even with the loud music the energy is so low. At this point in not sure the show will ever start. Management needs to promote this night so much better.",

But they take your ID with your credit card to start a tab, which I thought was strange to begin with.   I ended leaving the bar without closing my tab, realized in the cab what I did and decided to go back next day to get it. They open at 10pm during the week so I couldn't get there for about 3 days. I check my credit card statement and they charged me $40.  Although I did not spend the full $20 minimum. Nice 100% tip for the bartenders.  When I go back to Debonair they tell me they don't have my ID OR credit card. But they were able to charge my card without a signature. It's one thing to take a credit card, but it's absolutely ridiculous to take an ID for a tab when you are not competent to safely secure it. That will be the last time I ever walk into this establishment.  I am a 31 year old professional whose lived in the city for 6 years and I have never experience such incompetence when securing peoples personal information before.  BEWARE!!",

Upstairs there is enough room to move around and get lost either on stage or on the ledge by the big screen! The energy is very high there and everyone is always dancing and moving around. There are even events, such as burlesque events that happen every once in a while that are perfect for a chill night out with a little bit of extra fun.",
