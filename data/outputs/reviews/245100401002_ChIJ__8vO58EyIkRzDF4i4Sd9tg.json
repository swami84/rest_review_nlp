Something should be between the customer & the equipment making the food. Also watching the employee handle cash, cards, trash and raw chicken with the same gloves really disappointed me. The young male and female working customer service was poor as well. The Overflowing trash bin near food and flour everywhere also wasn't a good look.

Young man at the counter was apologetic saying that they only had one waffle maker working (Go to Walmart with the money you\u2019re making) ordered chicken and waffles, got waffles and salty chicken patties (they never said they were out of real chicken) I was charged $30. Complained to the manager and asked for a call.  I did talk to one of the owners who was very apologetic and promised to refund my money, Never heard back even after texting with him.  I would like to say something positive about this business but when you can\u2019t even keep your word after pitiful service there\u2019s no excuse. Very disappointed. Don\u2019t believe the hype!",

At 7:07pm, the young man behind the counter had served three other people (including the homeless gentleman who got his hot fresh waffle free after swearing at me for not giving him the 50 cents he demanded earlier). When I walked over to inquire, the counter man told me there was ' a rush'. When I pointed out that everyone else but me got their food, he wanted to give me a free drink. Next, he told me I should have 'said something.' He JUST then put chicken in the deep fryer. He then gave me the ubiquitous 'my bad' and seemed puzzled by the fact that I had no desire to wait another 15-17 minutes for my food, after being in court for 6 straight hours. He struggled to figure out how to refund my $10.47 Sad. I love supporting local businesses,  but it looks as though it's still Royal Farms for the quick delish post trial celebratory chicken box.",

If the business is that opposed to selling coffee with breakfast food, I will take my business else where and support the Asian restaurant.  Coffee pots are that inexpensive.... I don't see what the pushback is...  While businesses are their to support community, and solve a problem.  A business  needs to support the customers in a community too.  On Friday,  I said to Connies employee, do you sell coffee, and they said no. Then,  I went across the market to some Asian owned restaurant and Asian guy didn't know what he was doing but his trusted Black employee walked circles around his possible employer. I have choices I don't have to patronize your business. I can go elsewhere.",

My boyfriend and I came back up North for the weekend to visit family and attend a Ravens game and we got hungry for a late night snack in our hotel room so we went on UberEats and ordered from Connie\u2019s. These are some of the best waffles I\u2019ve ever had. I got the Captain Crunch Berry infused waffles with fresh strawberries and maple syrup and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and perfectly seasoned. My Captain Crunch waffles threw me straight back into my childhood. The batter was definitely fresh and the waffles turned out perfectly fluffy. To top off the amazing food, the wonderful people who prepared our meals took the time to write \u201cLove Connie\u201d with a smiley face on the top of both boxes. So thank you Connie for making our trip so much sweeter! I would strongly recommend this if you want good old fashioned comfort food prepared by people who genuinely care about the food they are serving!",
