My friend and I were promptly greeted and seated immediately. My friend and I were honestly impressed with the service and food. Also I got a cosmopolitan and I think it was one of the best I\u2019ve had. We ended up ordering hibachi for dinner and the food was amazing. We went in not expecting much, but left extremely satisfied. I did notice all covid guidelines being followed. I felt safe there, but was still able to enjoy my time. We avoided the hibachi tables just in case we would be seated close to other parties, but I noticed most parties for their own hibachi table so that was not a problem or there were two small groups with enough distance between. The atmosphere, food, cleanliness, staff, service, and overall experience was great. Definitely recommend!",

I went with my friends and the place was dusty looking which should have been a sign to get out right away. We were starving though so we gave it a try. The meals are over priced as I ordered a beef teriyaki for $18 which didn't even come with rice. I had to pay extra for that. It came with miso soup which was horrible and a salad which had browning lettuce. The sushi my friend ordered was unbearable. My beef teriyaki finally came, asked for medium rare but got well done. The meat was hot but the sauce was cold which means they buy store brand sauce and just throw it in. The vegetables were definitely out of a can mixed in that dreadful tasting and smelling sauce. My friend ate his meal before he was starving but threw up outside the restaurant after (think i'm exaggerating, check the cameras from 8/14/19 around 6 or maybe a little after). The staff wasn't mean but they looked and acted like they didn't want to be there. The best part of my meal was the water. The bill came to $86 for three people who left there still hungry and now sick. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay away from here",

According to online they close at 11:00 pm. As soon as we were seated, a waitress asked us if we wanted any drinks. Before she even brought out our water and we had a chance to look at the menu another waitress came with her pen and paper to write down orders. When she realized we hadn't decided what we wanted, instead of saying \"no problem, we'll give you more time\", she almost looked irritated that we were taking a minute. This is a group dinner with a bunch of my cousin's friends present as well- it takes a minute to collectively decide what is best to order.  So now we order our meals- some of us want Hibachi and some of us were ordering rolls. They tell us that in order to sit in the big hibachi table at least 7-8 people need to order hibachi. They said that its a \"requirement\". No where in the menu does it say we have to order hibachi. Did they expect to separate a birthday dinner based on people that were eating rolls and people that were eating sushi? So if five people ordered hibachi, they would be allowed at the table and then the rest of us would be moved to the regular seating area? Again, I understand if there was a heavy traffic of people and we were taking up seating, it would make sense. BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY. How are you going to deny a group of about 16 paying customers in an empty restaurant what they want. We were with guests so we sat there and ate their food in order to not make a scene. Or I would walk out and not give them any business. HOWEVER, the head chef, Vincent was extremely amicable. When I spoke to him, he said not to worry and that he would make it special for my cousin. He made balloon hats and gave her a free drink. He was a one man team. All the waitresses are extremely rude and unprofessional. When we asked for a plate for my 6-year old cousin, she refused to give it to us and instead began talking loudly to other coworkers. Before we even finished eating, the same waitress that took our order brought out a tray and started putting plates and cleaning up- basically rushing us out. A NIGHTMARE for a 16th birthday.",
