It was when it was Falafel Palace and their remodel (and ability to now take credit cards) has in no way impacted the high quality food, but given the restaurant a lovely facelift. One of my friends used to live down the street back in 2007 and was a regular (much more than I), and when we went in a couple months ago the guy behind the counter recognized him, was excited to see him, and took a picture with him.  I personally love the lamb and beef shawarma (get the hot sauce, it's not too spicy). Always soft, high-quality pita, fresh meat. My wife swears by the falafel. The service is always friendly, fast, and pleasant. I've long since moved out to the suburbs but going back for Aleppo will always be worth the drive.",

The portions were very generous for the price of them, and the variety of salads and sides in the portions made for a delicious mix of flavors and textures - and it was so colorful!  Also, the Syrian bread is the best Mediterranean bread I've had in Boston - it was soft, spongy, sweet, and absolutely delicious. Definitely would recommend heating it up in a toaster or oven before hand!  Thank you Moody's for a wonderful meal! Look forward to my next visit.",

Like inebriated moths floating toward the light of their store front the smell of middle eastern spices grabbed us by the shirt collar and led us in.  We found ourself standing behind a clean glass counter inside a small building where we were promptly met with fast friendly service at an ungodly hour.  Not being familiar with the menu and being a few steps from a state of mind that would allow us to make split decisions, when asked what we wanted we simply said whatever is fast and ready to go.  The man behind the counter proceeded to throw together what I can only describe as a masterfully crafted blend of lamb, tahini, vegetables and some secrets long passed down through generations....all at a reasonable price I may add.  Point being, there isn't a soul on that trip that wouldn't consider making the hour and a half drive to Cambridge just to once again taste some of the amazing things that came out of that late night kitchen.",

So I finally ordered myself a Mr. Aleppo, which had lamb and baba ganoush. I lack the culinary vocabulary to describe the taste but I can tell you it was an explosion of sweet, savory and spice all at once and it was awesome.
