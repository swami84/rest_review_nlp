We passed so many places to get here for the food to be just ok. The wings were good but everything else was not. It was our first time trying it and it was not crowded and service was still slow. The mac and cheese needs a reboot and they did not have the banana pudding why advertise it and not have the items listed on the menu I could see if it was the end of restaurant week not a good experience.",

Music: The music was entertaining but VERY loud for the space. Had to yell my order to the waiter. Food: Two people in my party ordered the Burnt Ends. The meat was not cut properly and undercooked. Flavor was bland and VERY tough. The mac n cheese tasted like a #2 pencil. The Beer cheese and pretzel appetizer was really tasty. Service: The greeters were very nice. Our waiter, Kevin, was more interested in watching the basketball game than waiting on any of his tables. Never saw him accomplish a 2 step process thru the whole night. Very distracted and inattentive. When my husband was ordering his meal, he told Kevin that he only wanted one of the 2 sides. Kevin said, \"it comes with 2 so you have to pick 2\". Seems kinda odd. For my daughter, who is a HUGE Cub's fan, we wanted to give her an amazing 16th birthday experience in Chicago, and dinner left much to be desired. For a $70+ meal for 3 people, we expected more.",

I wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken so if I had to do it again would have ordered a different meat.  We came on a Friday night and there was live blues music which was absolutely great.  That being said, it was a bit loud and I would recommend getting a seat on the top floor if there's a band playing.  Still loud enough to hear but also have a conversation.",

Menus were easy to choose from (not an overload of options like cheesecake factory), and everything on their menu was delicious. They offer indoor and outdoor seating.  The 2nd floor opens up completely to bring in outdoor air, and it is 70% covered but also has a pergola stretched over a portion for more sun and closer views of the Wrigley Stadium. Waitress and hostess were nice, quick, and courteous.  We didnt come on a game day, so it wasn't busy.  Service might be strained during game days - but that's understandable. Their cocktails were great.  I had a bourbon shot with a pickle juice chaser (they named it something clever and I just had to try it ^.^) which I highly recommend. Bbq sauce is left at the table for everyone to help themselves, and every single sauce is unique and delicious.  My favorite is probably their original.",

Your sitting right across the street from beautiful Wrigley Field and it's a great place to people watch and relax after the game. The one item I was very impressed with was the macaroni and cheese. Our server recommend it and she was spot on. I know they're know for the BBQ but definitely get the mac and cheese. Our server couldn't tell us what made it special so you know it's gotta be good. The one negative thing was the BBQ nachos appetizer. It looks so good but it was a disappointment to me. Not enough meat. I got the brisket sandwich for my meal and it was great so I recommend it too. Overall a great place.",

Initially, I only ordered a sandwich and a side to split with my son.  Then my server (Jeff, who was great) advised me that kids eat free before (I think) 6:30. Sweet! Ordered my son his own meal, and fed both of us for a bill of under $15, with leftovers.  They even included a scoop of ice cream for dessert with my son's free meal! I expected to drop $30-40 to feed both of us anything other than fast food in downtown Chicago.  Food was great, and our meal was served no longer than 5 minutes after ordering (not just a perk, but a huge convenience when out to eat with a 2 year old). As much as I like trying new places I've never been before, I was so impressed that I will be back next time I'm at a game.  Go Cubs!",

Four different types cover mustard, Kansas City style, hot Texas, and Texas. + The cornbread was interesting. It was pretty creamy and it was a generous portion.  The fine: The beans were good but unremarkable. The fries were a little too salty but hot and crispy. The mac and cheese was inoffensive. Not a particularly deep flavor nor did it have any bite (it was a bit mushy).  The not as good: - This was the thinnest sliced brisket I've ever seen, and it was dried out. I'm really curious as to the reasoning behind this. I was actually really surprised they served such dried out product. I would hope that in most places, if it's that dried out, it wouldn't be served. - There was a bit of plastic in my burnt ends. The manager came to see us and apologize, and they gave us a few bucks off of our order. I'm okay with how they dealt with it; I was hoping there'd be a bigger comp for chewing on plastic but I'm glad they didn't argue with us. - Slow service. The waiter was great; really friendly and he gave great suggestions. But there were two servers for the entire second floor. It took longer than I would have liked to get his attention for the plastic and check. (I went on a Monday afternoon).  Summary: I'd go back because at the end of the day I was satisfied with my meal. The value is decent and hey it's tasty barbecue. There were missteps in service but they cared enough to correct them.",

We were here on a Wednesday night and the first floor was half full!  Not bad for a week night.  They are really crowded on weekends and during Cub home  games.  Our event was on the second floor, with a full bar, lots of tables, and a great rooftop/balcony space that overlooks Clark street.  Two levels of great barbecue, music and drinks!  We had a wonderful buffet of salad, cornbread, rolls, smoked meats: chicken, brisket, and pork, macaroni and cheese, barbecue beans and smores for dessert.  Everything was delicious with a great smoky flavor.  All of the meats were tender and moist.  They have 3 choices of hot sauce on the tables, but, I felt that the meat was so good, that they didn't need any sauce at all.  I definitely will return here for the food, music and drinks!",

This is always a terrible sign, as restaurants that require three people to seat a guest - or where the staff prefers chatting with each other to serving - are usually in serious disrepair.  I wanted to grab a quick bite before my 2:30 PM tour of Wrigley Field so I asked for a table for one.  Ignoring my request, the hostess gave me her best stewardess \"over there somewhere\" point and told me to go figure it out myself in the bar.  Okay, but why are three people standing there to tell me to seat myself?  I didn't want to sit on a barstool to eat my BBQ but the place wasn\u2019t that busy so I sat at a table that seemed a little out of the way.  I read the menu and made my selection which was easy because it was a very limited selection:  5 sandwiches, 3 types of ribs, 3 types of salads, and some appetizers.  I was actually hoping for BBQ chicken, which would seem like something you might be able to get at a BBQ place, but other than a pulled chicken sandwich I didn\u2019t see any chicken.  I waited.  I waited.  I waited some more.  I was thinking I might have to ditch this place because no one was coming.  Fortunately they solved the problem as a hostess came up to bounce me off my table because it was \u201creserved\u201d.   Okay, but:  1) There was no reserved sign on it. 2) I had ASKED FOR A TABLE and had not been told to go find one myself, and then reprimanded for my selection. 3) I wasted 10 minute waiting for you not to come help me, but to tell me to go find somewhere else to sit.  Seriously?  Memo to Smoke Daddy\u2019s:  As near I could tell your entire second floor wasn't open (or at least, not open to me, when I specifically ASKED FOR A TABLE!!).  Don\u2019t close half the place then mark off a huge chunk of your remaining seats as RESERVED with an invisible rope line only you can see and then tell people to go seat themselves, because guess what\u2019s going to happen?  Realizing at this point I was doomed I said, \u201cNo worries\u201d and left.  I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to argue to get a table or plead to get someone to wait on me and I certainly didn\u2019t want to interrupt their fascinating conversations with each other.   If that's how they handle seating thank goodness I didn't eat any of the food, but fortunately getting seated was so dreadful I never got past the hostess stand.  I sincerely hope they close soon and are replaced with a restaurant with a functional staff.",
