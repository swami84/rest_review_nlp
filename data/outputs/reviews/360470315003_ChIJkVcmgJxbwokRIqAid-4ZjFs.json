The fish and service has always been outstanding (otherworldly for Brooklyn sushi standards) - so I immediately worried such a special place would crumble during COVID. It\u2019s a joy that, not only are Uotora transforming and thriving, but also the delivery has surpassed any I\u2019ve tried since the city shut down. This included driving to most of our favorite Manhattan spots for pickup that didn\u2019t Caviar outside the borough. Definitely a different experience yet equally tasty and unique feeling, which is hard to achieve. Uotora chef maintains the intimate, lux night out feel instead of converting to your average roll spot. Congrats to them!",

When I went there they still didn't have liquor licence so I had non alcohol Heineken which was fine keeping my drinking bill to the minimum. I wanted to try their sushi. I sat at the counter. Two sushi chefs there formally worked at Sushi Gari, so they are real pro. Each nigiri is freshly made right in front of you with some explanation about.each fish. My gave me about 11 pieces of nigiri on Omakase. They were really great. I had order four more white fish. Each different and unheard of. They were fantastic. I will definitely go back there.

As usual I get the Japanese greetings and sat down. There's an Ala cart menu but that doesn't get you a seat at the bar. I think Omakase let's you sit at the bar top. The place decor is minimal and cozy. Omakase is chefs choice 10 piece plus a Toro handroll and soup for 70 dollars. Before you finish the chef would offer any extra pieces please try the needle fish as it is in season as of now December! The sweet shrimp is definitely a must try. As you are served you get to see him orchestrate your food as he explains whats being plated in front of you. After the meal I chatted it up with my chef and was just very happy with them in general. I'm very glad Alot of Japanese chefs have decided to set up shop in New York city. My meal was about 120 dollars after tip and will happily come here again with my girlfriend. Give em a shot I'm sue you'll be satisfied with the Omakase experience they provide. Japanese food is an art and I think everyone should try it out!",

If you're looking for the authentic \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" experience in New York, this is where it's going to be had the most inexpensively.  The fish is imported from Japan daily, not overchilled, and prepared in the most authentic and caring way possible.  Each piece is made just for you (if you order Omakase at the counter).  I had types of fish I'd never heard of and I closed my eyes every time.  The rice is slightly pink, since it's made with authentic red sushi vinegar instead of the cheaper white kind.  The wasabi is then genuine spicier kind, not horseradish with green dye. This kind of place is what makes life worth living for me.",

The service is spot on and the interior is a simple design.  So the fish is sourced from Spain, Hokkaido, and the US West Coast. We went for the Omakase, which started with 3 bite size appetizers followed by 12 sushi pieces, and then finishing off with a handroll and the tamagoyaki.  Tonight's highlights include fresh octopus from Hokkaido (not sure how fresh can fresh get) and Spanish Yellowtail Tuna. The Spanish Yellowtail Tuna was super creamy; it was very surprising as I've never had tuna that was creamy.  I recommend reservations, but you can still get a table as a walk-in, but it's not very likely.",

The environment was relaxing, service was excellent and Chef Hiro was outstanding. Thank you Chef for a wonderful evening! A great addition to the neighborhood.",

Uotora is a great restaurant for the Japanese dining experience, but a poor restaurant if you are looking for a good value. The cost they charge is not worth the dining experience you get.",
