Our only complaint is we thought it was pricey 10 for a kids meal? No drink included? Lemonade was 3.50! Our son got a kids size and I got one..no apps-  bill was $80. $100 with tip.

We were a table of eight and everyone was quite disappointed with the quality of food that was brought to the table and the lengthy delay.  Appetizers, although somewhat decent in flavor, were small for the price and cold. We finally received our entrees 60 minutes after we sat down and two of the eight entrees were extremely over cooked (steak tips). It was actually quite surprising that they made it out of the kitchen.  We were told that the over cooked meals were being removed from our bill, but actually were not. We didn\u2019t make a fuss about it and paid for the two meals which were inedible, since the waitress was so horrified.  Apparently there was a great shortage of glasses too, as we had to ask servers times for the drinks we ordered - we were told, \u201cglassware are being washed\u201d. How does a restaurant run out of glassware during dinner time? Never experienced something like that before.  The wait person serving us was very friendly, professional, kind and courteous, however seemed very disorganized and quite embarrassed due to the quality of food items we were served and the lengthy time it took to get us our orders.  I\u2019m not Gordon Ramsey nor do I work for Phantom Gourmet, but I would consider myself a man of taste and this place lacked quality on multiple levels, especially for the price you pay here.  Dine somewhere else!",

She eats pasta like no other and loves the stuff, so it was really really bad.

They had a live DJ there playing great tunes to match the crowd. Most people at the venue seemed like they were there for the show as well. I ordered the recommended espresso martini. I was okay. The quality was not of a drink that should be recommended though as you can taste the cheep vodka and was not very smooth. We got a chocolate dessert. It was okay as well. Places like these typically do not make their own, but by a prepackaged dessert and sell them out of the box with a garnish on it.  The service was okay as well. It a great place to go get drinks, but prob not the best for a quality late night food.  Prices were decent.  Next time I go will prob be for drinks and fried apps before the show.  As we were leaving a large crowd stated pouring in from the early show to get drinks.",

We got no explanation as to what happened, so we left after not even getting bread or water to the table. I can't explain the rationale at all.  This was my only bad experience here, and it's really a shame. Ive had a great night every other time I've gone...",

I asked for cheese for my pasta and it never came.  Also, we ordered caprese salad and it came with JUST 1 drop of olive oil and no salt or pepper as shown on menu. To top it off, the bill had both chicken picatta and haddock picatta on the bill. Very pricey, poor service, will not return. Too many other better choices in the area.

If they are going to charge the prices that they do, please get the food somewhat right.  I ordered that evening's steak special which was a New York Strip on a bed of risotto. The steak was rubbery and filled with gristle. If you don't know what that is , it is cartilage running throughout the steak. I live for a good steak and was very disappointed with this showing.",

The gnocchi dish was also a little too sweet and heavy... overall, the carbonara dish (normally a heavy dish) needed a little more oomph and the gnocchi (normally a lighter dish) needed a little less - they hit that middle too much.
