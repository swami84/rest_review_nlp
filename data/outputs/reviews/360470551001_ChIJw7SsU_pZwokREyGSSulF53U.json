The starters were really great, highly recommend the leeks! The mains were good but overpriced for what they are and the size.

Originally after I emailed I got a response via text explaining to \u201cslice the bread for the ricotta...and grill the steak\u201d. Did not address what the items were that were delivered (problematic from a food allergy perspective). Just a fail from start to finish and if you\u2019re deciding whether this is worth it: no. *Addendum: steak was fine, needed salt, I would really recommend literature for the consumer re: the product being delivered. the number that texted said they would follow up with me the next day but never did.

The restaurant is a bit pricey considering that all of their main courses are pasta and all of the main courses are over 20+ dollars. That said, the food is quite good. My only criticism would be that the pasta is so well made and so fresh that it is a crime to cover it with heavy sauces which they seem to specialize in. Other than that, the appetizer selection is extensive and the wine list is good",

Crostini and peppers - crostini was good, peppers not so much  Runner beans - big serving and tasted great.  Fettuccine -  light, with right amount of cheese and pepper  Strangozzi - this was the best pasta, and al dente. Was a little on the salty side, but really enjoyed the sauce and the pasta  Linguine - would probably put this as third on the list. Again, a little on the salty side and parsley was good part of this pasta.  Given the serving sizing you likely won\u2019t be hungry, but don\u2019t skip the gelato. Was delicious and wish we could have tried e other flavors too  If you like pasta, come here. Service is helpful and quick, serving sizes are large.",

We are arrived five minutes early and were very snottily told that they couldn\u2019t help us with anything because they were still preparing the restaurant to be opened. Then why have the door open? Another couple came in at one minute before the official opening and they too were scolded. We were seated and the waiter was very snotty right from the start and especially so when I was speaking with him about the wine list and trying to understand what the different wines were as I am not terribly familiar with Italian wines. He kept steering me towards wines that were in excess of $125 Per bottle and was clearly quite disgusted when I ordered a $60 bottle of wine. We ordered two appetizers to share between three women and I have to say they were very good. The three meals we ordered were disappointingly small and mine in particular was tasteless. I asked if I could have some salt and cheese for my pasta. Salt was provided but they refused to provide me cheese. The reason is that they said the meal was intended to be non-dairy. When I said that that had not been specified on the menu the waiter\u2019s response was: well neither did it say you were allowed to add cheese. It was unbelievable. He would not deal any further with it and had a manager come over. It took 10 minutes for the manager to come over and of course my food was cold at that point. When I asked her about it she said it was not possible because the kitchen intended that to be a non-dairy meal. When I explained that I would\u2019ve expected that to be explained to me at the beginning she just shrugged her shoulders and said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do.  The meals that my two friends had were disappointingly small and while one was quite tasty the other was also very flavorless. All in all an outrageous and presumptuous set of behaviors. Never would I go there again and I will do everything I can to make sure people know what a terrible experience this was. And they should also be aware that my two friends are from Finland and will be sure to share this experience with their finish friends as they travel to New York City. What a terrible way to treat paying clients.  Oh, and by the way, the table was dusty as were the tables on both sides of us. What were they doing getting ready to open? Clearly not paying attention to cleanliness.",

Most people rate a restaurant solely on the food. I rate a restaurant on the total experience. Just like viewing a Broadway play or listening to a great symphony orchestra you are forced to take in and analyze the entire package. Misi is the entire package. From the second you walk in and before the great Aloha( we are from Hawaii) greeting you notice the soft but enjoyable sound of those on the line and the chef\u2019s and sous chef\u2019s constantly communicating. Then comes the honest and loving greeting. Memories of past evenings are communicated from those special ladies who are in charge of the \u201cisland\u201d where you check in. Then, if you were smart and reserved seats at the Chef\u2019s Counter you are privileged to be able to watch the concert/theater enfold right in front of you during the hours spent eating and watching what\u2019s in front of you. Your first smaller courses are some of the most perfect fruits and vegetables you can imagine. They are never too fussy and always created so that you can appreciate each and every component. Textures and hues are expressionistic scenes and never too heavy. Then comes the pastas. OMG are they unbelievable. Again, never too rich or heavy but with multi levels of clean and beautiful flavors and colors. Being former wine Educators from NYC for thirty years my wife and I really appreciate the way the wine list marries the food. Many single vineyards and hard to find wines that are explained just the way we taught our wine courses. There\u2019s absolutely no pompousness usually found in other great restaurants like Misi. Just the love and joy of something grown in the ground from Mother Nature. The whole evening is a theater of love. Just watching the non stop movements of those who were creating unusual and great things in front of us made for a very special occasion. Last night we had the Charred marinated peppers whipped ricotta crostini;  slow roasted tomatoes with hot honey, coriander , fennel seed;   lemon cucumber, fennel herbs, PASTAS:  corzetti, marinated sun gold tomatoes, garlic pecorino summer herbs; mandilli basil pesto, Sicilian almonds; Sheep\u2019s milk ricotta filled occhi, bottarga, lemon. Oh! Fabulous gelato...strawberry and cream and our favorite expresso.",

There are two huge bar seating areas which you will most likely sit at unless your party is more than 2 people in which you would get some of the few actual tables. I preferred sitting at the bar because the experience seemed more authentic. The roasted tomatoes with hot honey appetizer and the sheep\u2019s milk ricotta filled occhi pasta are A MUST. I have a feeling that this pasta dish is the shining star compared to the other ones. The only desserts that they have are gelato which are made in house and amazingly creamy and yummy. No dairy free desserts unfortunately. Regardless, I was very impressed with the food and plan on returning soon!",

They have a windowed room where you can watch them make all of the pasta by hand and it is quite mesmerizing. I made the mistake of ordering 1 appetizer, 1 pasta, and 1 dessert for one person. I do not regret it, but I was absolutely stuffed and I could not finish everything. I started with the grilled baby artichokes with mint salsa verde and it was incredible. The artichokes were so tender and the mint salsa verde was perfect for the summer heat. I could not finish this dish I had the hardest time deciding what pasta i wanted to try and i ended up trying the classic fettuccine with buffalo butter and parmigiano. Perfectly cooked noodles. Nice heavy butter with tons of cheese to make you feel full after one bite...but also so delicious you keep going back. I wish i was in NY for a longer period of time so i could come back to try all of the pastas here. The dessert. Goodness gracious that homemade strawberries and cream gelato...I might have to say it was better than the pasta. You just have to try it for yourself. They have a few flavors that are always on the menu and a seasonal flavor or two. This strawberries and cream was seasonal for June.  Definitely recommend this restaurant for everything they have. Great veggie appetizers, fantastic pasta, and incredible gelato.",

I started with the zucchini (quite tasty and simple) but the charred marinated peppers were unpalatable. I assumed that if they were charred, they would arrive hot and crispy. They were neither. They tasted like the mushy, over-marinated mess you would find in a grocery store jar of giardiniera. The pastas (particularly the tortelli) salvaged the meal. My biggest gripe with this meal was that it was a 90+ degree day and the establishment did not have any air conditioning. When eating hot, overpriced pasta that I waited a month for, I'd prefer not to be dripping in sweat. The place was unbearable and it is egregious they would take people's money when they cannot offer a basic comfort like AC during a NYC heatwave.",

As opposed to how it was presented in the video, I found misi to be pretty laid back despite the modern styling and chic look of its servers.  We ordered 2 antipasto and 2 pasta dishes to share, and the total including tip was about $85, which is very reasonable for the quality of food you're getting. There's even a large glass wall that allow patrons to witness the pasta making process, which is done mostly by hand!  The pasta was simply delicious and had that perfect texture of just being chewy enough. The sauces were simple but fantastic , never overpowering the pasta. However, the star of the show would be the antipasti. We got the eggplant and artichoke and they were about $15 per dish, but each one left more of an impression on me than the pasta! They each possessed exciting flavors that blew me away.  Overall, I can definitely see myself returning to misi to try all of the antipasti dishes.",

Ricotta appetizer was also wonderful but very rich. Eating it with the peppers gave a great balance.  Pastas were all very good.  Stuffed pastas almost melted in your mouth. Desserts were all gelato options. The olive oil gelato was my favorite. The rest of my party didn\u2019t care for it at all so if you don\u2019t care for salty savory dessert it might not be for you. My only criticism was that the appetizers came out one at a time. This ended up working out fine as we all shared each one as it came out, but I think the servers should tell you this is how the apps are served.  Decor is clean and fresh. Very appealing for me.  Servers and hosts were friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend.",

As walk-ins, we were seated at the bar after only a 10 minute wait. Bartender was supper attentive and helped us make good choices.  Food came out quickly but we never felt rushed.  Romanesco was *amazingly* good. Charred precisely to get a perfect flavor and crunch without being burnt.  I almost want to go back and just order 3 portions of this for dinner next time!  Raw fennel salad exactly what you'd expect anywhere in NYC.  Runner beans were interesting and tasty. They are kind of flat and almost meaty tasting, but in a good way.  Chickpea pappardelle was actually just regular wheat flour pappardelle with some chickpeas on top. The sauce interesting and good with an unexpected hint of citrus.  Rigatoni was indistinguishable from what I could make at home with a box and a jar.  Pistachio gelato was very Pistachio and very good and not too sweet.  Olive oil gelato was interesting and probably worth trying once if you have enough people to spread it around, but not something I wanted to finish or to get again.",
