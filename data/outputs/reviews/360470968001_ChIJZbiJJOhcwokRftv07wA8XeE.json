(Even when they know the sauce / gravy or oil will spill out)  DO NOT WANT TO WRAP YOUR FOOD WITH PLASTIC  I usually get the salt fish in the Morning with boiled dumplings and Calalou.  EVERY OTHER TIME I GO something is already done. I usually come in between 7- 8 o\u2019clock I do not understand how and it\u2019s establishment runs out of breakfast before 8 AM. (Imagine has a clear example - of the calaou missing ) some days it\u2019s the boil dumplings or even the salt fish.  This is something that management needs to fix because at 8 AM it\u2019s still breakfast time. There should be no reason that breakfast is running out before then",

I called 2x, both times I was told \u201cyes we will have make sure you come to place your order\u201d. When I get there at 7:15 I\u2019m told no we won\u2019t have it.  I said but I called 2x, a short older dark skinned Jamaican lady with the biggest chip on her shoulder states I said to call an check tomorrow, so far we are not having it.  I left, and my friend knowing how much I have anticipated having this for weeks call again and was told yes we will have.  When I called back the same lady with the attitude \u201cyes we\u2019re going to have it, I don\u2019t work in the morning how was I to know\u201d. Then in her attempt to hang up on me she put the phone down and starting discussing me, why I keep bothering her about this crab and dumpling and that\u2019s not her concern.  MANAGEMENT  YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR STAFF. At the end of the day it\u2019s customers that keep you in business.

First day I went and asked her for a small rice with gravy only; she refused to serve me the side because they didnt have enough rice and if someone else wants meat she wants to have available the portion of rice  that I want it to pay. I couldnt believe my eyes the way she handle that, so I left. I went back today to get a chicken paty with coconut bread for the total of $3.25 and I wanted to pay with my card; she said minimun amount to pay with a card was $5 dollars so I grab a juice and my balance was &4.98 she got mad and said that she cant charge me the amount that it has to be over the $5 dollars ... Whaaaaatt..!!! I asked her to charge me for a lil container of gravy- she refuses. If I do that type of customer service at my job I know ill be fired next day. Now I wont ever come back not even if is the last place open in the area. She makes sales go down by that behaivor.I went to the grocery store at the corner and I got the best chicken paty on a coconut bread and mozzarella cheese melted on top the best ever just for $3 dollars.Excellent. Ill make sure to tell my friends not to go there to avoid any bad service. SMH \ud83d\ude23",
