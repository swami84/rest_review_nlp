I called this place and ordered a large shrimp broccoli (not jumbo shrimp), I also asked the lady on the phone do you take card, she answered \"yeah yeah\". I went in and said I ordered over the phone and pulled my card. The lady in front said no card, cash only; she kept Pointing  to the atm across the street. I was upset because I asked prior to going over there. I came back with cash before handing my money I said $13.50 right. Again she said \"yeah yeah\" . When this lady hands me my change she gave me five cents back  out of  twenty, and shows me jumbo shrimp broccoli and I'm asking her why and saying this is not right. Finally, I had my boyfriend speak to her Chinese and he also got no where with her. To end the conversation, I just took a small plate of food that cost $20. I will never ever ever ever even if god ask me go back to that place. I understand times are hard but it's hard on everyone and over charging people is not the way to make it better.",

Jelly Fish Cold Dish ($12.95)- This is your typical dish of jelly fish except that it doesn't come with all the meat and other stuff. Underneath the jelly fish has carrots. Great for a starter.  Crabmeat & Fish Maw Soup ($16.95)- This is my favorite soup. I always order it especially for dinner.  Pan-fried Noodle w. Beef ($9.95)- This is a huge dish. I'm a big fan of crispy noodles that also have some sauce underneath so this was delicious.  Stir Fried Sliced Conch ($35.95)- I'm a fan of conch too, it's a bit chewy. But it's sorta fun to eat and chew. The portion for this was quite big too.  Jumbo Shrimp w. Honey Walnuts ($20.95)- One of my favorite dishes to order at a Chinese restaurant is this. Shrimp is deep fried and comes with a mayo honey sauce, which is best part.",
