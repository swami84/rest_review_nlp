He really takes his time and has a meticulous attention to detail. The vibe of the place is really cool overall and they offer a lot of cool services and it sounds like other barbers are great too. Highly recommend this place and Dermaine specifically!",

So, as restrictions are easing, I wanted to go down and support these hardworking people trying to make it through extremely challenging times that are far from over.  So earlier this week, I stopped in and started with a bite, brew, and good conversation at Clock Bar. I went with a local Checkerspot IPA, an order of perfectly fried wings (tossed in their homemade spicy BBQ sauce - not on the menu but ON POINT), and some deviled eggs. Each hit the spot and fueled me up for a little retail therapy.  I completed my trip in their clothing store - where I found some solid goodies for my father for his upcoming birthday - as well as a sweet pair of pants for myself. The service was wonderful and they have some great sales happening right now to get them to other side of this pandemic. As a sign of the times, I also picked up a QG PPP mask, and look forward to marketing this fine establishment as I do my part to keep us all healthy.  Add the QG to your list of stops when getting back out there. Rusty, Craig, and their team make you feel welcomed the minute you walk through their doors - and they deserve the love!",

Staff was wonderful; Janice the massage therapist and Sam the barber we're very nice and welcoming. Couldn't ask for any better treatment from the staff. Reason why I gave 3 stars was because during the massage session, all I could hear were some of the staff talking and laughing in what I presume was the room next door. It was like the room I was in was next to a break room. Wasn't expecting that as I thought these areas were supposed to be like libraries.  Oh well. Next time will try the Four Seasons Spa instead.",

I requested that the new haircut conform to very specific measurements.  The stylist, Tiffany, did exactly what I asked while providing a haircut that seemed just right for me!  Afterwards, as soon as I began sharing pictures of my transformation, I started getting comments about what a great new look it was and everyone was extremely complimentary.  I considered many barbershops before deciding on The QG, and I am very glad that I went here.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for some of the highest quality work in the Baltimore area.  Tiffany was professional and detailed, and she listened very well to my requests while making small suggestions about what could work better.  The overall environment of The QG is classy but friendly, and I was treated with great respect and care throughout the entire experience.  The atmosphere of luxury is unparalleled, and once you walk inside you would never know you were in downtown Baltimore.  The whole thing was only $45 plus tip for about a 45-minute haircut and wash--I never got the feeling that anyone was trying to upsell me or to get me to buy more of their products or services.  This is a fantastic place, and I plan to return here in the future!",

Everything for me took about 4 hours. They were so accommodating and even purchased extra glitter in anticipation of our arrival though they only had one nail artist working. The cost was a bit steep, especially considering there weren't really any kind of group discounts or packages but it was a really fun experience, in a really cool environment & the people that helped us all day, especially the nail techs were so nice.",

        "caption": "I've had this note on my list for a while to provide feedback on my first visit to the QG.  As a psuedo milestone, I came to the QG to say goodbye to my first beard experience that I started growing about 9 months back in preparation for an Iceland trip (to get that Nordic feel, ya know)? I wanted a decidely \"luxurious\" farewell as I decided to go back to my five o'clock shadow look, vastly prefered by my wife. I also decided to make sure it was a memorable moment, I would do something more upscale, so I chose this based on some recommendations.  I liked the establishment. It felt more at home than your typical barbershop. The atmosphere was great and the greetings at the door were very welcome. To preface the next part, I was called about a week before because I had booked an appointment using MindBody and asked for two services, shave and haircut. A gentleman left me a voicemail that this would likely take longer than 30 minutes, so I needed to call back and extend my appointment. I did just that the following day, a Tuesday, and arranged the additional haircut for half an hour earlier. Thinking I was golden, I put it out of mind until my appoitnment the coming Thursday.  I hung out for about 10 minutes after I arrived assuming another appointment had run late, and requested the front desk to show me around the location to ponder joining. I got to see the floors with the spa, clothing, cigars, and met the bartenders on the top floor. I was impressed, and appreciated the tour before returning to the waiting room.  It was about 10 more minutes where I felt uneasy that I was approaching my original appointment, and was forewarned they may not have enough time a couple days back. A fault of my own was the fact that two additional voicemails were waiting on my phone that I had not checked. I work on a military post with little service at my duty locations and often go dark with electronics once I get home, so I assumed it was already taken care of and I never looked twice.  When I asked, they couldn't find my added appointment in the system, and had to ask my stylist if she could take me any sooner, which she could not. When my original appointment came up, I sat down and we had to talk if my haircut or beard shave was more important based on the time. I chose the latter since this was about the beard, but my lion's mane (party in the back) needed some upkeep, too, and I didn't want to make a second visit or go to another barber shop.  At that moment, I knew my experience would either be cut short or rushed. The stylist was good, very friendly and did a great job with the shave. She managed to sneak in some trimming to my hair (I'm growing it out, so I just needed some maintenance and to cut the back to match the growing top). I enjoyed the shave, and the cut turned out ok, but this moment was somewhat soured by feeling rushed and nervous as to our time. I paid for both services at the end with a healthy tip, but assumed that if both services were done in that window, corners were cut along with my hair, and I probably didn't get the full QG experience.  I did get a drink at the bar after to \"celebrate\". I got the bartender's recommendation, a dark cocktail that was very good. The bar was nice as well, and I wished I could have stayed long enough to try their food (a friend had good things to say about the selection and taste).  All in all, the experience was good, but without the snag, I can't help but wonder if it would have been the experience I was looking for to have my new go-to spot for grooming coupled with food and spirits. I may try it again, and will have to be extra careful that the communication was on par so nothing feels shortchanged.",

I was visiting back home this weekend, and needed to get my haircut (in the Marines we have to get our haircut weekly). Finding a barber outside of a military town, who can cut a high-quality faded is usually a struggle. I have tried many different barbershops in the Baltimore region, and have yet to find one of my liking...  until I visited the QG this weekend! I booked an appointment online with Laura, for 1100 Saturday morning. And I was more than pleased with not only my haircut, but the the experience as a whole! Laura did an amazing job with my faded haircut, and did a great job answering any questions I had. Luckily for me, she had time before her next appointment so she gave me a tour of the entire QG Department Store! The entire facility is not only clean, but extremely accommodating. The staff throughout the store were kind, welcoming, and most importantly of all they were very professional. They did an excellent job of making sure my needs were taking care of, and ensuring I never had to wait around. I could continue writing all day on how great the QG, their staff, and the experience was, but I will wrap this up with this. If you are in the Baltimore area, and are looking for a relatively inexpensive, professional service. Whether it be a simple haircut, or you are getting a new suit tailored, the Quinntessential Gentleman is the place to be! It is your one stop shop for everything you need in your daily and professional life. The experience alone is worth its weight in gold. I will definitely be returning to the QG for many years to come, and I hope others will too!  - Ryan C.",

Her attention to detail and professionalism are perfectly coupled with her lighthearted personality. You will be hard-pressed to find someone else who cares as much as she does for her client's appearance.  In addition to the haircut, I also opted for a straight razor shave. Justine was my fourth (and likely final) attempt to find a barber who knew their way around blade and face. She took the necessary time to minimize nicks while making it an enjoyable experience.  Without a shadow of doubt, I will recommend all of my friends, family, and passing strangers take a seat at QG for their next haircut. Their dedication to the craft is second to none.",

Friendly staff offers you complimentary drinks.  But\u2026 that\u2019s not the important part.  You wait for your appointment in a lounge with a pool table, but\u2026 you guessed it, that\u2019s not the important part.  So what is the important part?  I\u2019m not sure I want to tell you.  I had to find out the important part the hard way.  Now Google wants me to just give it to you?  I don\u2019t think so.  Come with me for a few more sentences and I may tell you\u2026  Months before I found the QG, I called people around where I live and asked about the important part.  They all assured me they had the important part.  So I went there, sat in their chairs and watched them.  They did not have the important part.  In fact, they failed quite miserably at trying to pretend at the important part.  So I searched online for the important part.  Nothing.  I searched some more.  Nothing.   Perhaps it was too much to ask.  Then an idea came to me\u2026 what if I was willing to travel into the city for the important part?  It\u2019s a 30 minute drive, but if they have the important part... maybe it would work?  That\u2019s when I heard of the QG.  At first it sounded somewhere between hipster heaven and an old school barbershop.  I was skeptical.  I\u2019m not as young as I once was, and I have no time to drive up to the city just to have someone call me sir, while they try very hard to be trendy.  So I called them.  \u201cDo you have the important part?\u201d I asked.  \u201cYes.\u201d They replied confidently.  \u201cI see, well who is the best at the important part?\u201d  \u201cEveryone here is equally good at the important part, sir.\u201d  \u201cNonsense.   There can be only one person who is the best.  I want to hear about the one person who everyone else goes to for the important part.\u201d  Silence.  I could tell someone somewhere was running around to get the answer to my question.  \u201cBrendan.\u201d  \u201cBrendan, you say?  He\u2019s the best you have at the important part?\u201d  \u201cYes, sir.  In fact, he is an expert at the important part.\u201d  \"We'll see about that.\"  I scheduled an appointment to see Brendan that weekend.  On Saturday I drove 30 minutes into the city.  I parked in a paid parking garage.  Then I walked around the building and went inside to meet the so called best.  On my way I ran into an old friend.  Years ago he cut my hair. He was good people, but I always suspected he was secretly a Mafia hit man cutting people\u2019s hair as a cover.  We exchanged pleasantries and went our separate ways.  Then I sat down in Brendan\u2019s chair to see if he knew the important part.  After another 30 minutes one thing became clear: he knew the important part.  Later I would find out that Lauren knows it too.  There may be others at the QG that know it as well, but I am older than I once was and unsure if I can grasp the concept of that many people knowing the important part in a single location.  So for now I\u2019ll only say I travel to the QG every month for the important part.  Weekends, weekdays, it doesn't matter.  I've sat in traffic, dodged parking ticket police, and paid double what I would spend locally to make sure I get the important part.  I highly recommend you give them a try.",

This place was very comfortable and the staff was beyond friendly. Lindsey (barber/grooming expert) was really good!",

She did not even did my side lock or asked if it was good what she did. This place should be more of a beer bar rather than hair saloon. She made the cut so horrible that i have to go to walmart after leaving from there and buy a trimer and get bald completely. I would rather go to the barber down the street and have him cut my hait rather than messing with these bunch of unskilled idots...... Bottom Line dont waste ur money here you will regreat...",

Everyone is welcome at the QG.  Great service, great cuts, great times.  For not much more than the price of a bad haircut at the mall, you can get a true barbershop experience from a caring and friendly staff.  Highly recommend to all!",

I have been there a couple times now and each time i walked away feeling good about how i spent my time, money, and how my face and hair looked.  Ebony studied my head, heard what i said, and instantly finished my thoughts and began sheering after receiving my nodding smile.  Jennifer gives a great facial and is pleasant to converse.  I think you'd be pleasantly surprised if you go!",
