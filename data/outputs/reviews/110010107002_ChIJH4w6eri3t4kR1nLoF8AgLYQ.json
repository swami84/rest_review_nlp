Don't overeat your first bread! Both wine and dessert Tiramisu were delicious.  The moment I left the shop, I thought about when I would come next ^ _ ^  Good conversation with delicious rice and wine, it was a really great time! Thank you for bringing me.  It seems better to make a reservation on Fridays and weekends. Risotto absolutely eat ~!

        "caption": "My wife and I are in town celebrating our 3 year anniversary and we had quite the experience. The food was fantastic and fresh but we had terrible service (at first). One of the young ladies spent 15 minutes chatting away with \"friends\" while my wife and I sat there not being waited on. She offered the other table fresh Parmesan and cracked pepper as a topping on their entrees but never offered us any. However, two other waitresses saw that we were not being attended to and practically took over for the first waitress. The original waitress would only occasionally stop by (in between conversation) to just fill up our waters but the others would come by on a routine basis to make sure we were ok. At the end of the night, we faced a conundrum: we want to leave a tip but we do not want the first waitress to pick it up. We asked to speak with a manager about the matter and she waived the whole meal. Wow! Well, I couldn't leave without anything, so I walked to the nearest ATM and withdrew money for a tip and gave the tip money to the other two waitresses. I also gave the manager (who also is the owner's wife) some cash for our meals since it was not her fault. FOOD WAS EXCELLENT AND OVERALL THE WAITING WAS GREAT!",

        "caption": "As others have mentioned, this is a hole in the wall place serving good Italian food. This place is easy to miss if you don't pay attention, and then you have to step down to get to the restaurant.  It is a tiny place compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood and generally more than half the tables are occupied.  They have a decent selection of real Italian dishes. The dishes here are not overly cheesy nor buttery - and pasta is cooked perfectly - al dente!  I generally get the rigatoni with Italian sausage, or the linguine with mussels, or the fettuccini.  They do have a good selection of dessert but I never have any place in my stomach for it as the main dish is generous enough for my appetite!  Service is good too and that goes well with the food :)  Nice little gem in the area :)",

The \"agnolotti\" were actually large raviolis made with thick dough in a heavy sauce, whereas true agnoltti are a small pocket in a very simple broth or butter sauce. Was disappointed there. The fried mozzarella was like any fried food: makes you happy, then makes you question your life choices.  You must check out their vintage website though!",
