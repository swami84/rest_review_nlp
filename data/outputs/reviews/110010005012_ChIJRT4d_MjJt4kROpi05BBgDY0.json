We sat and waited at a table, saw a couple of employees on their cellphones which was obviously more important than their jobs. We ended up walking out and went next door to the District which was excellent. Cons: no service, and strange odor. I called the restaurant to find out why there was no service. Apparently the manager was in the basement when I called. He admitted the waitresses were on their cellphones.  I do not recommend this place at all to anyone especially if you are hungry or hypoglycemic or have children. I was visiting from New Jersey definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. Not tourist-friendly either. An empty Italian restaurant on a Saturday night speaks volumes and not good ones.",

The portions are good\u2014 enough that you can finish most of it and feel pretty full. The staff is super friendly, and the house wine is really good and well-priced (I think it\u2019s like $6 a glass all day? I don\u2019t remember for sure, but I know it was cheaper than most Italian places per glass). I\u2019d definitely recommend, if you want a nice, tasty Italian place that won\u2019t break the bank!",

The meat and fillings were flavorful, but the dough was over cooked.  It was hard and had a slight burnt taste.  The other problem knocking the place to 3 stars were the cheap chairs (see photo).  The base has barely enough  surface  for a 12 year old, and the back curves away from the food - zero back support.    You need to give a strained lean in to eat, and your back feels it after the end of experience.  I wouldn't be opposed to another visit, but with all the taverns in the area, not my first choice.",

My boyfriend and I were searching for an Italian restaurant this evening and the ad by the Italians Kitchen caught our eye. It was amazing.  We had the Bella Napoli Bruschetta as an appetizer. The bread was crispy but not a severe crust where it would rip open your mouth on the first bite.  We followed it up with our entrees. He had the beef lasagna and I had the beef cannelloni. I stole a bite of his, it was delicious but mine put his to shame. I finished my whole dinner including the breadsticks. It was so fresh and perfect. The pasta is homemade and the sauce wasn't thin, wasn't too thick or chunky, it was perfection in a sauce.  We also had the Homemade Tiramisu. I don't care for Tiramisu because I don't like coffee. However, my boyfriend is a big fan. He said it was very good. Not sure we'd order it again though. It's a 90% Tiramisu according to my boyfriend the Tiramisu connoisseur.",

Very solid pie with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, pancetta and I think one other basically fancy bacon meat. Crust was just short of excellent (I live in Indiana (though I'm from California and spent 11 years in Seattle) and am unaware of any crust there I'd consider excellent). The side salad I got was simple but good, though they put on too much salad dressing. Ingredients were fresh and good. The vibe was laid back, the service was friendly. I typically rate things on where they fall on the price line on one axis and quality axis. The issue on my rating today is this: it's been years since I ate in this neighborhood or DC. I paid $24 for a 10\" pizza and small salad and ice water. This seems a little high for an 8 out of 10 quality food place (and again, it's better than anything I'm aware of in the State of Indiana with the possible exception of a place in Bloomington, IN), at lunch that isn't costing extra for atmosphere. So given it felt a little pricy for lunch at a laid back place, and given it was the best pizza I've had in a while, but not among the truly great pizza places, I'm giving it 4/5 stars. Again, I'd highly recommend it. I'd just warn it's slightly over priced.",

They ordered a pizza with mixed meats on top. Apparently they couldn't eat pork though they ordered pizzas with sausage on top. That was completely  their error and to me, it was up to them to pay for those pizzas and any other pizzas they may want to replace them with. Management was called in to resolve the problem. They wanted new pizzas, most likely at no charge, and the manager looked understandably a little perturbed but he ended up letting them order new pizzas.  I know that they say the customer is always right but they were most definitely wrong and the manager handled it very well.  After he took away their \"unworthy\" pizzas he went ahead and gave them to us at no charge. This all happened in the span of a few minutes and we had already put in our order. We wanted to cancel our order but still pay for it as a good gesture but their kitchen staff was too quick and our pizza was almost ready.  As far as taste, it was very good! I highly recommend supporting this family run restaurant.",

We had the Paradiso - 3 stars, the eggplant - 4 stars and the cheese - 3 stars. we got a bottle of wine for the grownups - brownie points to them, they have a cute winestopper and wine bottle bead decoration thing  :) for dessert, I would recommend the tiramisu cake - not for the ones who are tiramisu fanatics, but a well rounded tiramisu and cake. Dont get the chocolate cake - it was rather dry. The molten chocolate pie was delicious - just wish it was bigger!",

        "caption": "The pizza was fine.  The restaurant reeked of mold and everyone chose to sit outside.  This place is a Gordon Ramsey special.  We ordered a salad.  They obviously took Spring Mix straight from the bag and threw it in a bowl.  About 10% of the leaves were wilted and had to be picked out.  We both ordered a glass of wine.  It was amusing that the wine glasses didn't match; the silver ware all were different designs and you didn't get the feeling it was deliberate.  We are traveling and didn't know the neighborhood.  Just order your pizza to go and take it to your hotel room.",
