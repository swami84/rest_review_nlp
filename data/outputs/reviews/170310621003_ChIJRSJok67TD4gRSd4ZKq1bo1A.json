It\u2019s hard to be a restaurant operating during covid  One of the worst dining experiences I\u2019ve had in awhile. We went for dinner. We all ordered a round of cocktails and not a single person enjoyed theirs with 4 of the cocktails missing entire ingredients. The cocktails were $12-$15 and tasted like I overpaid for them at a nightclub. The food was cold and made us all feel a bit ill afterwards. Two people in our party ordered the steak and were not asked how they wanted it cooked. When they tracked down staff to ask for a medium rare steak, they said their default was medium well. What kind of restaurant never asks how you want your steak cooked and then defaults to medium well?? We paid an extra $4 for our pasta to have chicken and not only was that inedible but there were approximately 2 pieces in it. The mushroom flatbread wasn\u2019t even on par with the frozen Trader Joe\u2019s one. My party travelled 30 minutes to come here and we were intensely disappointed. When we asked for the manager they weren\u2019t even on the premises and we had to argue with the staff about how bad both the food and drinks were only to be told we must have a \u201cdifferent palate\u201d. In the end we did not have to pay for drinks and got half the food compensated, but to be honest that took way too much arguing and we probably shouldn\u2019t have had to pay at all. And I forgot to mention the drinks didn\u2019t come for 45 minutes and the food didn\u2019t come for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.",

I booked a table in advance and two people in my party were a little late and the host wouldn\u2019t let us sit even though you have 90 mins from your reservation start time.  The table was not ready even though they made us wait.  The hostess was incredibly rude to my friends for no reason. The first thing she said was \u201cWe are not accepting walk-ins right now\u201d with a really condescending attitude before I even said anything. I told her I already had a reservation but my friend is running a few minutes late but we would like to sit and order. She made us wait on the sidewalk until my friend came. This whole wait rule is ridiculous especially since you have 90 mins from the reservation time. What are they accomplishing exactly by making people wait for their whole party? The hostess was also not wearing a mask the whole time.  The food was good but not worth the price and the menu had a very limited selection.  If you want mimosas, you order a bottle of champagne and pay extra for Orange juice. You\u2019ll get a single small cup with literally two fingers of juice.  The champagne \u201cglasses\u201d are made of plastic that went through multiple wars and looks barely washed. The utensils aren\u2019t much better.  The servers were really nice and helpful and wore masks the whole time, which is why I still tipped 20% despite the horrible hostess.  Overall, waste of a Sunday brunch!",

Note: we are in quarantine times for those reading, so it was a weird time.  My gf and I ordered food online. There was a great deal--an app, 2 entrees (talkin them Eric Entrees) and a dessert. I had been craving wings for a week so I chose wings as the appetizer. When I arrived to pick up my food, the front-of-house employee says they are out of wings--would I like to choose another appetizer? I was irritated at first. They called my gf while she was driving and so she did not pick up the phone but they tried to let us know. I did not know this, so I chose the nachos -- with chicken added-- even though there is an up charge for chicken. He said he could only give me the nachos without the chicken and I argued that since I paid for wings, the up-charged-nachos still cost less than the wings I paid for.  Well you see, I was very hungry and had forgotten that I actually bought a bundle deal. I didn't pay for \"wings\"--I paid for an appetizer. And the base appetizer you get when you order nachos does not come with chicken. I was technically in the wrong to argue for my chicken to be added free of charge but the man obliged. I realized the mistake I made when we drove away and felt like a jerk but it made the fact that they gave me what I asked for on a day when things were clearly weird for them mean a lot more. I now have a loyalty to Hutch and will at least be back again to try the wings! I really appreciate them giving me the benefit of the doubt in my time of hunger. When this world opens back up from quarantine, I can't wait to stop in for a couple of beers. They got my loyalty.",

The server was super nice, but had way too many tables and thus was pretty inattentive at getting refills on cocktails. The food came super quick which was at first a surprise but then the food tasted like it had been sitting out and was probably reheated prior to service. I'll probably be back as I usually have good experiences on weeknights but if you come on a busier night, expect a different experience!",

During the time that the waiter was very busy - with talking to his friends - the other guy took care of us and provided a few items on the house (including soup and hot Mexican sauce). I wanted to tip him instead of the waiter - but he refused it. He is the star in this place and they get a 5 from me because of him.",

They gave my friend a free drink for that mistake and didn\u2019t charge us for the coffees/teas which was nice of them. If I had to guess, they were very understaffed in the kitchen.",

My only complaint - and I can't believe I'm typing this - is that the portions were a bit too big. I ordered the Amish chicken, and my companion ordered the pork loin. Both were big enough to have been shared. (And, we have big appetites, generally).  The star of the evening was the burrata appetizer! Superb!",

They have a decent selection and I decided I would try their breakfast burrito.  After a short wait (it was crowded), we were served. The burrito was good but not outstanding. It was smaller than others served. The eggs were good and I do admit the Chorizo was very well prepared. The fruit they served with it was a little underripe. Other than the fruit, I really enjoyed the brunch.  And, again, I only wish I could remember the server's name or I would call him out so you could ask for him when you go.",

They have a decent selection and I decided I would try their breakfast burrito.  After a short wait (it was crowded), we were served. The burrito was good but not outstanding. It was smaller than others served. The eggs were good and I do admit the Chorizo was very well prepared. The fruit they served with it was a little underripe. Other than the fruit, I really enjoyed the brunch.  And, again, I only wish I could remember the server's name or I would call him out so you could ask for him when you go.",

Coming from Toronto, where we love our brunches, we were not disappointed.  We got lucky with the weather and were able to enjoy the sunshine on the patio. Our server was practically a sunbeam herself, was very personable, put us into great mood, and talked us into the large carafe of mimosas. A gentleman at the table next to us overhead me ordering the Big Biscuit and Fried Chicken, and interrupted us to say it was one of the best new things he'd had in years. Again, I was not disappointed, it was one of my favourite meals from our entire trip. My partner is still talking about the Totchos he had as well. We're going to try to make them both, but replicating them will be a challenge! If they ever open shop in Toronto we'll be there on opening day.",

The atmosphere was great for catching up with a friend but would probably be good for a date as well. It wasn\u2019t too dark or loud so it was easy to have a conversation.  The cocktails were tasty and inexpensive but not very strong. And there was an interesting selection.  I ordered the fish tacos and they were fine, nothing to rave about but still good. The fries though were very good, I couldn\u2019t stop eating them. I was surprised that they were thinly cut and crispy because most of the places I\u2019ve been to recently have slightly thicker fries. These were perfect.",

The options seem limitless whether you want sugary sweet or deliciously savory. The service is nice and friendly. I highly recommend making a reservation as there always seems to be a wait for brunch on the weekends. Personally, I can't wait to go back and try all of the things I didn't have last time!",
