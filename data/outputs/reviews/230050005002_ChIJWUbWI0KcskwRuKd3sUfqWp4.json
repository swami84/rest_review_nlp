Tables were far apart (excellent adherence to Covid-19 regulations). We ordered two flights (4 Oz pours x4 for only $10). The beer selection is excellent (20 types of beers) to choose from. The Sea Dog Blue Paw blueberry wheat ale was by far our favorite! Light and delicious with an excellent blueberry flavor that is not overpowering. I must find where to buy this ale and get some. There is a cute gift shop by the restaurant as well where we picked up cute lobster Maine shot glasses.",

Shortly after we were seated, there were a few parties lining up to wait for a table, so we were lucky we didn't have to wait.  A flight of four beers is $10 so my fiance and I got a flight each. Here is what we had:  CBD Organic Blueberry Seltzer - was intrigued since neither of us had a CBD drink before, but this tasted like a raspberry Emergen-C  Tap O' The Morning - this was an Irish stout, which I didn't think I would like since I don't like maple, but it ended up being one of my favorites of the flights  Shipyard Summer Ale - light and refreshing. Since we went at the beginning of September, I really appreciated the fact that they still had summer beers but were also bringing out the fall beers already too  Smashed Pumpkin - not a fan of pumpkin beers but fiance loved this one  Melon - this was so good! So much so that we ended up buying some to bring back. Trying to hold onto summer for as long as I can  Sunfish - another good summer beer. It's grapefruit and it's very light  Blue Paw Blueberry Ale - didn't care for this. I'm starting to think I just don't like blueberry drinks  Black is Beautiful - I love stouts but even this one was a bit too bitter for me  Really glad we got to try all these beers. Flights are usually hit or miss but we liked most of the beers we tried.  Note - the servers are really nice, but some of the staff working in the store are a bit rude. They will straight up see you waiting by the register to ask a question and then purposely walk away.  Tip - they close at 6 PM so make sure to come early!",

Ordered beer and found it good, no, pretty decent. So do some research and lo and behold, there is the hut in Portland that produces the stuff and fills it in this incredibly stylishly labeled bottle. Actually, I just wanted this shirt, but contrary to my plan, I ended up on the other side of the swinging door. And the whole thing with four specially put together tasting glasses of unknown types of beer. Fireberry and melon in particular were a huge new discovery for me. The Brewers Choice Pilsener is more or less German-like and finally a beer beyond the overcrowded varieties of some micro-breweries in New England. Incidentally, I had a conversation with the boss, who thanked us for the personal grading of the beers tested. Overall, a very nice place to shop and linger. Highly recommended !!  (Original) Schon in Woburn, N\u00e4he Boston, sind mir die Pub-Mitarbeiterinnen mit dem pr\u00e4gnanten K\u00fcrbiskopfreiter auf dem R\u00fccken aufgefallen. Bier bestellt und f\u00fcr gut, nein ziemlich anst\u00e4ndig, befunden. Also recherchiert und siehe da, in Portland steht die H\u00fctte, die das Zeug produziert und in dieser unglaublich schick etikettierten Flasche abf\u00fcllt. Eigentlich wollte ich nur dieses Shirt haben, bin aber entgegen meines Vorhabens doch noch auf der anderen Seite der Schwingt\u00fcr gelandet. Und das Ganze mit vier eigens zusammengestellten Probiergl\u00e4sern mir unbekannter Biersorten. Vor allem Fireberry und Melon waren f\u00fcr mich eine krasse Neuentdeckung. Das Brewers Choice Pilsener ist quasi German-like und endlich ein Bier jenseits der \u00fcberfruchteten Varianten einiger Micro-Brauereien Neuenglands. Nebenbei noch ins Gespr\u00e4ch mit dem Chef gekommen, der sich umpf\u00e4nglich f\u00fcr die pers\u00f6nliche Benotung der getesteten Biere bedankte. Insgesamt ein sehr netter Ort zum Einkaufen und Verweilen. Highly recommended!!",

They do have a really nice selection of tons of merchandise including shirts, signs, mugs, and even six packs of beer. The tasting is a nice touch but was so overcrowded on the weekend that I couldn't even get a pour. Sadly not dog friendly. It'd be nice if they had more of a brew pub like the other breweries in town, but it's still a good place to get a sample.",

A big part of Portland's great beer reputation is Shipyard.  After doing a tasting we were definitely not disappointed.  Their public space has a large store full of their beer and clothing.  I haven't been to many breweries that do such a good job of selling their own beer in cases.  Perhaps that is because few of the \"micro-breweries\" are as big and successful as Shipyard.  We watched the video of the brewery's history and then went to the bar area for our tasting.  This may have been the best beer tasting we've ever had.  The large number of beers we were able to try stood out.  We really enjoyed all of Shipyard's beers.  They definitely hit the sweet spot for the many styles.  Because we were there at Thanksgiving they had their Oktoberfest beer steeply discounted.  This was music to our ears.  24-packs were so cheap (I think $12) that we had no choice but to buy a few cases.  The fact that Oktoberfest is such a drinkable beer is backed up by the fact that we only have one or two bottles left; we tried to pace ourselves.  When you go to Portland Shipyard is a must-see brewery.",
