The eye-pleasing decor and lighting is only surpassed by the comfortable bar stools and booths.   They have a wide variety of beer and every other libation you can imagine.

The Elote is a MUST.  We also had the vegetable tacos (my favorite item), mole tacos (more sweet than spicy), and the black bean quesadilla.
