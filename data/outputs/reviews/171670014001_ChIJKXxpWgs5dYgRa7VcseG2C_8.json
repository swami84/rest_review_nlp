Then the next room is a nice dinning area. 1st impression is good. Seated and given menus, drink orders placed. Menu is nice with the main options being pasta dishes or what appears to be nice hand tossed pizzas. Orders placed, food received. My thoughts as they brought out the salad was they put a lot into a small bowl. The main course looked and tasted really good. As a side note the portion sizes are probably what you should be receiving, a regular size (not large) serving. Food & service was great but not nearly as good as the cannoli cake. Definitely give this place a try.",

They never did so we sat down at a table that said reserved and was set for 3. We waited and waited for one of the 3 servers to stop by our table. We never even got menus. We looked on our phones at the menu and decided to just keep waiting. Servers passed us every couple minutes. (2 girls and 1 man). They avoided ever making eye contact or talking to us at all. We thought maybe at some point someone would tell us they would be with us shortly. There were 7 other tables seated divided among the 3 servers. Clearly they were busy so we were patient and kept waiting. After a full 20 minutes and a phone call to Saputos to make a reservation there, we walked out. We walked by 1 of the female servers who had walked by us 10 times atleast and she still never even made eye contact or said a word. I get being busy and am always happy to be patient and wait. No acknowledgement what so ever is inexcusable. A simple \"we will be with you shortly\" in a 20 minute time frame would have been all it took.",

The spaghetti and meatballs and cream of potato soup I ordered even came with some delicious fresh baked bread! The thing that topped it all off though was the black cherry gelato I got for a dessert, it was super satisfying and perfect. The staff was super friendly and attentive as well. We intend to come back and try the dinner menu in the future.",

The pizza came out super quick and was perfectly cooked, the linguine alfredo was perfect, and served with really good hot bread.

However other tables were ordering from the table.  I am not sure why.  We then waited 30 minutes for our food to come out and were completely ignored by the staff the whole time.  Meanwhile many other tables that came in after us were getting their food.  Then I went back to the counter I ordered at to ask what was taking so long, and to refill my own drink, though other tables were being brought drinks by servers. ~5 minutes later the manager came over and said it was a problem with their printer that had delayed our food.  Another 10 or so minutes and our food came out (so this is about 45 minutes after paying).  The pizza crust was way too thick, undercooked, and soggy.  The pasta was fine but nothing special. No one came to ask us how it was, and in fact we were once again ignored until we left.  No reparations were made for the fact that we waited three times longer than the other customers.  This is not the type of service I expect anywhere, but especially when paying over $30 for two people to eat.",

I've tried the lasagna, which normally I don't like, and it was good. The staff is amazingly friendly. And the envionment/ambiance is terrific. There isn't anything I don't love.  And my picky 8-year-old thought his cheese pizza was the best ever.",
