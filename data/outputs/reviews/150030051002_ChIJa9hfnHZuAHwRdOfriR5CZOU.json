That fish is taste like soil and undercook on one side, it is listed as market price on the menu.  We told the lady about the problem and she said there is nothing they can do.  Other food was ok. A little bit on the oily side.  Covid time is bad for most of the business but this is not how you make money. Worst experience ever during our trip.",

The check-off of a dime discount was not given back. Not only brought the United States to the taste of the country, but also brought to the domestic unscrupulous business style. Don't come, taste good, not authentic Hunan cuisine  I never gave 1 star for bad service. I'm an Asian I only care about taste I don't give a shit about waitress ain't give me a warm smile or check my drink often. The taste here is great but the service Is too bad i have to write a 1 star review.  So this fish dish costs almost $50. The bottom half was uncooked. Not slightly uncooked, the meat was completely uncooked. I found out about this when we have about 1/3 fish left. I asked the owner to come over. He didn' t offer any apologies and say he'll bring this back to the kitchen to cook it again. Of course, after he brought it back, the whole fish was kind of broken. I had no interest to eat and I felt disgusting already. We checked out, I offer the owner at least give me discount on this dish since it was a really unpleasant experience and we couldn't finish it because of your fault. He laughed at me and blamed me finish the fish already.  So here we are. 1 star review here. Report to credit card company. Report to public health agency.  Don\u2019t eat here.

I\u2019m an Asian I only care about taste I don\u2019t give a shit about waitress ain\u2019t give me a warm smile or check my drink often. The taste here is great but the service is too bad i have to write a 1 star review.  So this fish dish costs almost $50. The bottom half was uncooked. Not slightly uncooked, the meat was completely uncooked. I found out about this when we have about 1/3 fish left. I asked the owner to come over. He didn\u2019t offer any apologies and say he\u2019ll bring this back to the kitchen to cook it again. Of course, after he brought it back, the whole fish was kind of broken. I had no interest to eat and I felt disgusting already. When we checked out, I offer the owner at least give me discount on this dish since it was a really unpleasant experience and we couldn\u2019t finish it because of your fault. He laughed at me and blamed me finish the fish already.  So here we are. 1 star review here. Report to credit card company. Report to public health agency.  Don\u2019t eat here.",
