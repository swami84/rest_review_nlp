But when I moved to NY it was impossible to find a kosher bakery that didn't serve mediocre baked goods. I almost felt like because they were kosher they bakers did not think they needed to try. But \"say it with cake\" is nothing like that. There baked goods are awesome and taste great. They have so many kosher choices and even change around what they sell so your not stuck with the same old stuff. I give \"say it with cake\" 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who is kosher or wants to buy something kosher as a gift to friends",
