What disappointed me is there is no online menu that I could coordinate with my sheltered family at home and my inability to capture good picture to due to the glare from my phone nor the glare on glare from the PPE barrier with the cashier.   Nevertheless the milkshake and cup/cones ice cream I drove 14miles to get was delicious.
