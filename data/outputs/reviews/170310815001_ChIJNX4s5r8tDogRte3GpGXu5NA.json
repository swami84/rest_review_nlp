It\u2019s ok, but like nearly all Thai food in Chicago, the food here is a little bland and comes no where near authentic Thai flavor.  Also note, this is Brightwok Kitchen. They say they're sister restaurants, but as a heads up, if you go to pick up a Double Thai order, you'll go to Brightwok and there is no signage.",

I had a late night spicy food craving, and so I decided to go on UberEats and get the HOT HOT Drunken noodles with Antibiotic-Free Halal Chicken for delivery.. IT IS HOT HOT!! But, that does not mean it is not delicious.. The noodles were bright, vibrant, and were cooked very well and were not too hard or too chewy. The spice was perfect for me, although I did keep reaching for a drink every 2 bites. Getting the Masala Chai with this was a great decision. The Masala Chai comes in a Mason Jar (without ice), and it is beautifully thick with a rich coconutmilk flavor. It paired VERY well with the spice of the noodles.  Delivery was quick and fast. And, despite the fact I ordered the food late, it was still good quality. I do not know how their food is in earlier times, but if it is this good at 12am.. Then, wow.  (I am happy that I didn't end up adding three extra red thai chilis to the noodles since I was thinking about it..)  Overall, food is amazing, I loved the chai, and one thing I really loved about this was on the bag I got they gave a little paper attached with a Meme Of The Day! Very cute and made my night. :) I recommend this place fully. And, if your someone who loves spice, like LOVES it, or maybe you're bad with spice and wanna push yourself... GET THE HOT HOT DRUNKEN NOODLES!! They do not disappoint. Not only that, there is a wide variety of additional toppings you may add to them to really customize it to your liking. I also like the fact that they offer recyclable, compostable fiber bowls. Amazing place. DEFINITELY gonna order again.  My cat kept sniffing my food too. I guess he likes it as well.  EDIT: I just took a bite of the noodles with a whole Thai red chili unknowingly on accident... OH NO!!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Have any of you ever felt your tongue throb & vibrate before?  Mine is.. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!",
