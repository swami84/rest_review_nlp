Not enough precautions taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I visited in late August. The Condiments need to be distributed in smaller packs or served by the server, not put out in large Containers and Help-yourself format where everyone will touch the jars and bottles. The restaurant and tables also needed cleaning between customers. The restaurant was empty when we visited and the tables had crumbs from previous customers. We had to clean our table before sitting down to eat. During our meal the owners stepped outside the front door, left the front door wide open and started smoking while the door was open. Horrible cigarette smell and smoke while dining. No bueno! Other than that the pizza was tasty. Better suited to takeout.",
