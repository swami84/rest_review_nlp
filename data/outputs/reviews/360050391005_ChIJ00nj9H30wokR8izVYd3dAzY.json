We made a reservation but upon arriving the restaurant was pretty empty so this was likely not needed. We were seated outside in a nice cozy table on the patio. From the moment we were seated our waiter was obnoxious in asking for our order. We didn't have 2 minutes to look at the wine list when he is asking us for entr\u00e9e. We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and appetizer but that did not deter him from coming over literally every 2-3 mins to ask for our order. While I totally ubderstand tables are limited during this tough time the place was empty. I could only imagine how rushed someone would feel on a Friday or Saturday evening. The food was was decent but with all the offerings along Arthur Avenue we probably will not be back.",

The Grilled Sardines over arugula with a very light lemon dressing (might have been just lemon juice) was an amazing appetizer. My wife had the special of the day, a seafood lasagna with a bechamel. She loved it. For main course I had their homemade GF Pappardelle with a Ragu. Best GF pasta I ever ate. They sell frozen packages of it to take home so I bought three different ones.

The setting is peaceful, and great for family dinner,  large groups or a romantic night out. The appetizers are tasty with a lovely presentation. The main course will be your favorite part.  Whether it's a 30 ounce steak or chicken Parmesan the chef who you can meet personally cooks everything with love and care.  Also please do not skip on the cheesecake and other delicious baked goods because it will help close out the amazing experience with authentic Italian coffee. If you have a large group please make a reservation so they can give you the best service possible.",
