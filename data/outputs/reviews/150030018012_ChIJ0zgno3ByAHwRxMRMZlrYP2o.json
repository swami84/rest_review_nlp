Paid $100 for two person meal, feels like price is decent for full course meal, but they need to work on the individual dish",

Even though the host grandma is friendly, the food quality and service is not that good. Firstly, the sukiyaki with prime beef is not that good for $68 value, the beef quality is tough and not juicy at all compared to others. For me, all San Diego restaurants can beat this place. Secondly, there was smoke all over the place, might be due to the sukiyaki smoke. Also, there was a fly flying over the appetizer and we need to request to be changed. Finally, we waited more than 40 minutes just for the check. Yes 40 mins! During the waiting we are trying to be nice and another younger hostess checked 3-4 times to see if we got the check. However, we don\u2019t have the check even the other tables called the check after us. The overall dining time is more than 2.5 hrs incredibly. The only good thing is the grandma hostess was nice and gave us 1 more egg for Sukiyaki for free. However, you may would like to go to other places with better food and lower price definitely based on my comment. I really don\u2019t recommend this place to any of my friend.",

Kids had the Udon, chicken teriyaki and sashimi that was incredible and I highly recommend this place for some authentic Japanese eats.

Cons: *There were 2 sushi chefs and one of them (not the guy preparing our food) was NOT wearing his mask (he had it under his chin for 90% of the time we were there!) He was yelling goodbyes and responses to orders consistently over the food with no mask on which made us very nervous. He was constantly touching the counter, the order papers, and at one point he wiped his nose with one finger. I understand sushi chefs may not wear gloves because of sushi rolling but then they shouldn't touch so many things especially their face during a pandemic! *Hawaii state law for indoor dining is 50% capacity but the room we were in was at 100% capacity. It was clear there were 2 other rooms judging by where customers were being taken by the servers so not sure how full they were but our room was full and the tables were barely 5 feet apart. (Diners were definitely closer than 5 feet apart.) *The room was quite warm and I wonder about the ventilation.

        "caption": "please mark here as dine in only, there is no take out at all, I tried several times, at first they will tell you there is table available, but take out will take 2 hours and half. The second time they just tell you no take out, they are busy Food is good though. Just here as a reminder, no take out during cov19, not a good way to handle the virus  =========== Added after owner reply =========== The main reason I feel upset is because I want to reduce the risk for cov-19, that's also the main reason government recommends to take out order, reduce contact, keep social distance. I understand you have to focus on dine-in customer first and \"inevitably\" limit take out order, but it means you are ENCOURAGING customers to dine-in instead of to-go, which makes me have to decide, whether to have more risk of cov-19 or choose another place. But the reason I left this comment is to remind others you don't have to go order, which is your waiter told me clearly in the telephone, and it still doesn't explain why there is place for dine-in, but you are \"too busy\" for to-go. The only explanation is you keep the resource waiting for dine-in even though you can take to-go orders. WHICH I think is good for your business but not recommended during pandemic.",

Service however was a bit slow since the servers were occupied with a number of big parties, including private rooms. This wasn\u2019t surprising, if not for the sushi chefs swiftly preparing food that waited on the servers for what seemed to be too long. Good value and quality overall.",

The sushi is fresh, and the rice is made perfect. I would give 4 for the food.  But, one of the rolls had way too much wasabi in it. I am a huge fan of wasabi, but I couldn't even dare to give a second try. I could only think it was done on purpose. I eat sushi almost once a week, but I had never had one like this before. The chef also gave that weird look on us (like checking how we are doing)  The service was terrible too. The waitress kept talking to us in Japanese although we know zero Japanese, and kept rushing and forcing us to order an expensive course menu. After all that, she included tip on the bill herself!! Terrible experience...  It ruined our first night in Waikiki.  Do not come here if you don't want to ruin your trip.",

        "caption": "This restaurant is a nice respite from the growing plethora of Japanese fusion restaurants, serving up closer to the traditional sushi shop where the appreciation and craftsmanship is focused on the fish, rice, and the interplay of flavours. They also have a pretty good selection of sake to accompany the meal.  I stopped in one night for their omakase for dinner. Well worth the price, serving up 16 distinct pieces of nigirizushi all well-crafted. The cuts of fish were fresh, and most pieces had a good balance of wasabi and other flavours. They presented the raw shrimp first then asked if I wanted the head deep-fried -- an unexpected but nice departure from sushi restaurants in the West that go straight to deep-frying.  Their housemade tofu was very delicate, smooth, and light - delicious!  Service was also very attentive, and catered towards the American audience (e.g. I was immediately offered cold water instead of some hot tea).  Only things I found disappointing were seating me at a full table when a bar seat would've been nice, and the dessert that came with dinner. When ordering an omakase set, part of the experience is chats with the chef and receiving a brief explanation of each piece; unfortunately the servers just dropped off each plate and walked away, without even mentioning the fish (if you're a sushi fanatic you'll recognize the cuts, but less helpful to novice diners). They also only offer typical ice cream flavours (like vanilla, green tea, red bean); authentic Japanese desserts would have been nice.",

However when we visited there the second time we just didn\u2019t get any service what so over. We reserved the seat over the phone and once we arrived there a bit early we still didn\u2019t get seated for a good 30 min. Once we got the seat, we still waited for again 30-40 min to get menu!  We truly felt like we were treated poorly. We had to ask for the menu to be given to us, and the waitress just threw it at us.  We are sorry if we can\u2019t speak Japanese, but I don\u2019t think it is the reason to treat us any different then anyone else in the place. We weren\u2019t disrespectful, we waited as long as we could.  Overall we reserved the seat for 6:30 and got seated at 7. We got the menu at around 7:35-7:40. And we got food only at around 8:30. If the waitress or the staff had communicated with us more properly and respectfully, then it would have been a perfect evening. But with such a service the waiting time just felt too long.  Bottom line, do you want to feel like an outsider? Do you want to be looked down upon? Well if you can\u2019t speak Japanese this is the place for you.  If you do; however, speak Japanese, then it will be an amazing place for you.",

There were foods that our 1 yr old was able to eat as well (and he loooved eating at a table on tye floor.) Excellent service, our waitress was very patient with our food ignorance and taught us a lot of culture and customs from Japan. We absolutely loved it.",

We order the Chirashi dinner set which consist of 6 courses. The portion is very generous for $36! The set includes appetizers, miso soup, Chawanmushi (steamed egg), Chirashi, and dessert. The fish is very fresh and tasty. We left very satisfied and cannot wait to go back!  I've read some reviews about bad service at this restaurant, especially from people who don't speak Japanese. I really think it's a big misunderstanding as I cannot speak Japanese either - Our server is actually a very sweet lady who genuinely loves all the food served by the restaurant. She made sure over and over that we enjoy all the dishes.",
