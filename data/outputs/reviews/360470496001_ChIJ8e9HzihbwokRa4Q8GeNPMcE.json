It was estimated to be done in 40-50 minutes. that's fine. An hour goes by. Nothing. I figured ok, ill wait longer. An hour and a half goes by. I call and no answer. now TWO HOURS. I look back on GrubHub, THEY CHANGED THEIR STORE HOURS AND THEN MARKED THEMSELVES AS CLOSED.

Even if I waited longer, it would've been worth it because the food and service was amazing! Definitely try one of their margaritas which is of course served in a Patron bottle, haha  Food was very flavorful and the presentation was great! Our server Maria was very attentive and sweet. In fact, two other employees came up to us to check on how we were doing.  Really loved this place and will definitely be coming back!  P.S. Don't forget to get your free flan when you check in! :)",
