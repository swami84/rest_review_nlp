It was some of the worst fried rice that I tasted in a very, very long time. Compared to the sushi I also ordered (which was not completely all of that neither, it was just filled with avocado and very, very little crabmeat) I would've never thought they would serve some bulls**t a** food like that fried rice but hey now I know better and I will NEVER order anything from this place again, even if it's the last restaurant standing.

And from the outside, and really from the inside as well, Osaka didn't help out me at ease.  The entire place felt like one of those dime-a-dozen cheap Chinese delivery places.  You know the ones.  With the carpet that has been vacuumed sometime this week, but hasn't been shampooed since the previous owner bought it.  The place where they have that ugly gold cat statue that waves its paw at you while you rethink your life choices.  Where the vinyl covering the seats has long ago split, and the wood grain contact paper is peeling from the tables.  Yeah.  That place.  And then I ate their sushi.  I have to be honest; what I ordered wasn't the best sushi I've had.  It wasn't even the best in Louisville.  But, I now realize that was my fault for ordering things I will eat, and not sticking with flavors I like.  I learned this by starting perhaps the biggest fight I have ever had with my wife when, after sampling her sushi, I gave up on eating all of mine and started stealing hers.  I do not know what kind of magic these men are performing with the fish.  I am not sure I want to know.  What I do know is that their skill and talent is far too high to be in such a terrible looking restaurant.  These are the kinds of chefs I expect Anthony Bourdain or Alton Brown to be standing next to on television, telling you how they will blow your mind, rock your world, and change sushi dining in Louisville forever.  Yes, it was that good.  The only reason this place isn't 5 stars is the decor, and the service.  (Look, I get it, I ordered spicy rolls.  I like spicy foods.  I still need more than one refill during an hour long meal.  I don't care how busy you are, you can visit the table every 20 minutes.)",

The teriyaki sauce was thick and it looked like they had just smothered it on only the top part of the chicken. The chicken was dry. I had asked for yum yum sauce and was 1/4 full in the plastic Togo sauce cup when given to me. I am only writing this review because I have tried these dishes at other Japanese restaurants and it has never been this way. The mushroom soup was not that good either. I understand the sushi may be great, but they need to step up on the entrees as well.",

The batter on the outside was super thick and tasted like a bad fish fry. The temperature of the fryer must have been off because the rice soaked up so much grease that I'm still queasy thinking about it. Worst sushi I've ever had. The only good thing is you can get 2 rolls for the price of 1 on Mondays and Tuesdays. Maybe a regular roll would be good, but I'll never know, because I'll never risk going back...",

The Japanese visitors behind me seemed to enjoy the sushi.  I had a bento box lunch which was tasty, but $20.  I never did get my drink.  Try to go there when there isn't a large group, else you will probably suffer the same poor service.",
