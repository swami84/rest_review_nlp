The chef is not shy on using their Thai spices, being that said, some food are spicy, so be prepared.  The staffs were very attentive, patience, and caring; they give you the best advice.  We\u2019ve ordered peek gai yang ka min (crispy chicken wings), samut sakorn pad Thai (braised pork belly pad Thai), and kao thod nhaem klook. All were delicious!  I\u2019m honestly a very good cook, but this place beat me! Will definitely come back to try more food!!",

        "caption": "I am born and bred in Thailand, living in bensonhurst neighborhood over 5 yrs.  There wasn't any Thai restaurants in the hood at all. When Pad Thai Kitchen 1st opened I thought Hmm interesting.  Decided to give the try, all dishes I ordered were so good.  Gai Satay : in Thailand there are usually 2 choices, satay Pork or Beef. I guess Pork is not popular in America so all Thai restaurants cooked with Chicken. Before I ordered I was afraid its gonna be dry, but I wanna give it a try. They cooked with dark meat chicken, which is pretty good. Tender and juicy, good marinade. Peanut sauce on side were perfectly good, it also come with Ah-jaahd (sweet-vinegar) as well, which is originally served in Thailand.  Khao-Soi : its Northern curry noodles style. Its so hard to find good Khao Soi dish in NYC. they dont disappointed me at all. Rich and thick w coconut soup, also the level of spicy heat is perfect. If you're low tolerance with spicyness It might be a bit spicy to the area but if you're looking for original taste, This dish is perfect. I give 10/10  Chantaburi Pad Thai :  Chantaburi province is next to the ocean so they're big on seafood. In Thailand they cooked with whole crab. This restaurant cooked with softshell crab which is an excellent choice. The flavor's on point, the noodles perfect texture. I give 10/10  The server who took my order, she's kind and sweet, also she expresses the level of hospitality which its rare to find in the neighborhood. She's knowledgeable of Thai menu which was a sweet surprise, bc she isn't Thai.  Overall, great value for their pricepoint even if it's slightly above average for area, because their quality of ingredients are definitely above average, some ingredients even have to be directly imported. Much appreciation to the chefs/owners for bringing this gem to this side of brooklyn, and i hope to thank them in person one day.  I cant wait to try other dishes and sitdown inside restaurant for a full kitchen to table quality experience.",
