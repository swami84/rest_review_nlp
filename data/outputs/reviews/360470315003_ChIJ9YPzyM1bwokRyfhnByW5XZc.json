I decided to take her up on the offer to come back to the restaurant. My friend and I came in today around 1:00pm for the weekend brunch. They were packed and very busy and running low/out of certain items but Latisha made sure she took care of us. We wanted 2 orders of French Toast but they only had enough left for one, so we ordered French toast, Pancakes Berries N Coco Cream and a Soy Sausage Tofu Scramble & Cheese Platter. Initially we ordered it to go since there was no space and they were so slammed, but eventually while we were waiting, seats at the bar opened up and we decided to dine in since half of our food had been ready and packaged for awhile, but the pancakes were taking longer to be made.  The French Toast was DELICIOUS. The syrup had almost a burbon flavor to it, along with the strawberries & blueberries and the coco cream was amazing. The bread itself was a little thin but tasted great! The pancakes were also tasty, but they were basically the same as the french toast (same toppings). The Sausage Tofu Scramble was ok... not the greatest, but I did enjoy the sausage. We were also missing the avocado toast with it, but they were so slammed and we had been there for awhile, so I didn't want to wait for it.  Latisha was bright and cheery and made conversation with us throughout or time in the space. She was clearly working very hard to keep things running smoothly and make sure all the orders were on point. I truly appreciated her commitment to making sure my friend and I felt welcomed and appreciated as a customers.  I feel like if there was maybe at least one more staff member working at Latisha's commitment level to the food and customer experience that this place would be absolutely INCREDIBLE. I know they're still a brand new establishment and working out some kinks, but I hope it continues to grow and elevate with dedicated employees.  But I am super thankful for Latisha's personal commitment to her customers. Thank you for making things right for us!",

Their fries are all hand cut and you can even see them doing it from the pickup window. Their Mac and goodness is oh my goodness! It is soooo good that it\u2019s hard to believe there is no actual dairy in there! My only complaint about it would be the price. I paid $7 for a small side order and don\u2019t believe that I got enough for what I paid for. Their kale is super delicious with a mildly sweet undertone that keeps you coming for more! Their Jerk chicken wasn\u2019t all that jerk-y and definitely could have used more of the Caribbean spices.",

I'm not sure if it's the preparation but those plantains were not fully fried, there were sides of bright yellow. The portion amount seem small especially given the large packaging. The sauce was bland and too thick for my liking, almost a consistency of mayonnaise. Not worth the price.  The sweet potatoes were watery, not much flavor. The red cabbage slaw was bland, no flavor and was unnecessary to add. The mac and cheese wasn't cheesy enough for my liking. The jerk chicken flavor couldn't make up for the texture of the vegan meat. overall the entire dish was bland, watery, lacked flavor and was a disappoint. There are much better vegan restaurants out there in Brooklyn that offer much more flavor, firmer texture and better portion size for a lower price. Won't be ordering from here again.",

They were selling a delicious apple, cucumber ginger juice and I had some of that as well. At the end, I was offered a slice of cheesecake, and it was delicious. Here is my complaint, this place is too expensive. The cheesecake alone was $7.50 and thought it was offered, I was not told the price. I'm searching for a vegan spot with delicious food, but not such high prices. If price isn't a factor for you, you will love this spot!",

However, I\u2019ve been a vegetarian for 25 years and the biggest issue my family and I always had was access to healthy, tasty and affordable vegetarian/vegan foods!! It\u2019s such a shame that this same type is cuisine can\u2019t be offered at a more accessible price. The wrap I had was pretty tasty, but really how often is a customer going to pay 17 dollars for a wrap to go with no sides, no drink just a wrap? I want to be able to support local businesses like this one and will go when I can, but it\u2019s still a shame that people gotta break the pocket to enjoy a good vegan meal.",

They are so warm, friendly, and hospitable, they make you feel like you're eating at a relative's house.  The food is indescribable. I had to double check and make sure the food was vegan because the meatball sliders were out of this world. The veggie tacos were well seasoned and had a creamy, slightly sweet sauce that tied everything together. The mushroom sliders were not only delicious but hearty and filling as well. My mostly meat eating brother-in-law was so impressed with his spicy bowl he commented that he would try being vegan if he could \"eat this well every day.\" We also ordered all the fries (yucca, yam, and plantain) and loved the chipotle avocado sauce that came with them. The meal ended with a moist chocolate cake with a frosting that was light, fluffy, and perfectly sweet (in other words not too sweet).  The only downside was that I couldn't order more because I was stuffed. We will definitely be going there again.  I am so glad we found this place!",

The cook must learn how to prepare the same quality of food with speed. Not sure if they are not provided with the proper equipment (electric stove \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffe), the containers used to hold food are too small, so they\u2019re constantly cooking, which slows everything down, absolutely no counter space for them to prep properly.

My order was $30 (not including the $10 Seamless code I used). This is not okay.  Since they're a new business, I will try to give them another chance...but this was awful guys.  $30 for this? Really?",
