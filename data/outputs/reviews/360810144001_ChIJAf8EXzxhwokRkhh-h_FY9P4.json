It's located at the end tip of Kew Gardens and at the head of Richmond Hill. If you are not driving you can take the J,M,Z train or the Q10 bus to get here.  I came across this place a few years ago while picking up pizza at Dominos which is next door and once I took a look at the menu I automatically regretted getting the pizza because I could have gotten some good home style food instead. From that day I vowed to go to try a lot of the items on the menu at Soup Junkies.  The menu is straight forward, you can order a variety of soups, they have a lunch special for the chicken and fish dishes where the portions are smaller. I would definitely go for the bigger dinner portions.  I recommend: Corn Soup Oxtail Soup Curry Chicken (it was seasoned to perfection, this is my go-to when I order from here, the cabbage is not cooked down much so it has a crunch) Jerk Chicken (if you like it spicy this is for you, if you don't like saucy jerk chicken this is not for you but you are into finger licking jerk rather than dry, this is great)  If you plan on dining here, the restaurant is pretty small so only about 2-3 people can sit in (Pre/Post COVID).  The staff here is super helpful and friendly. They currently offer delivery and pick-up.",
