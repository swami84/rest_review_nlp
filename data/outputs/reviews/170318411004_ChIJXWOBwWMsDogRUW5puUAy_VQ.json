I get the same noodle dish everytime so I know how it looks and recently it was just bean sprouts with barely any noodles and a tiny portion. It's normally a huge portion.  Servers would never come over to the table to check on us. It took me 20 minutes just to order some food because I had to try and get a server's attention even when the restaurant was 80% empty. If you want triple crown, stay away from the original and go the new Triple Crown location(2217 S Wentworth Ave, Chicago, IL 60616). It's the best location.  I felt very unwelcomed when I gave them no reason to dislike me. I was very polite, but now I realize why everyone goes to the new location and not this one.",

        "caption": "Lots of food for the price but I gave 1 star for the following:  We had bad service. The woman who took our order apparently spoke no English. Instead of getting someone who does, she attempts to take our order (which takes forever due to the language barrier). She then calls someone who DOES speak some English over to verify the order that she has taken from us - which needed some editing. After about 10 minutes, we finally have our order in.  My friend asks for Dr. Pepper, the woman says okay and leaves - never returns with a drink. Turns out they don't have Dr. Pepper so the server just didn't bring her anything or even let her know they didn't have it. So she calls another server to the table to ask for a Coke, \"diet Coke?\" Is the response she gets. \"No, Coke. Regular Coke\" - the woman leaves, confused, but comes back with a Coke after several minutes.  Our food comes within probably 15-20 minutes. The order is correct. We start eating. Meanwhile, a large family taking up two 8 person tables is seated not far from us. A child within that family starts smacking chopsticks on his plate, very loudly, and for a very long time. Almost the entirety of our meal, actually. Several servers went to that table for various things and let the disruption continue for at least 20-25 minutes. The only reason is stopped is because their food came.  Every bit of this is bad service, in my opinion. I did not leave a tip. I wrote \"None\" on the tip line to be clear that it was not an accident. The woman who came to collect our signed receipts confronted my friend and asked why he wasn't leaving a tip. Mind you, our bills were separate and he HAD left a very small tip because he ALSO was unhappy with the experience. She instantly got an attitude and snapped \"I work hard\" and \"why you no leave something for us?\" To which I responded \"if I'm being honest, I think the service was bad and it's absolutely inappropriate to DEMAND a tip that was not given to you for a reason\". She mumbled something, I responded \"you don't have to worry, I won't be returning\" and she stormed off.  So, I think if you want to order food from here for take out, it's probably worth it. The food WAS good and I did get A LOT (will attach picture - chicken chow mein) but if you're a person that cares about customer service find somewhere else to dine in.",

We decided to get the set dinner meal for like 10 people. It comes with a good mix of food to satisfy everyone's craving. The food was pretty standard and not too greasy.

From the time we arrived and requested a table for 4, the waiter was already having an attitude, it became worse when we asked for a oolong tea, he gave us jasmin tea and argued that they never serve oolong tea and turns his back on us. We proceed to order our food and he still has an attitude, but we tried to be nice to him. He first served the soup but he bangs the soup bowls and spoons so i volunteered to serve the soup my self. We asked for water and bangs glasses infront of us. The japanese tofu we ordered is so salty as was the salt and pepper smelt fish; it looks like they rolled these foods in salt.  We asked  to replace it, he just take take the food and turns his back and when hes about to enter the kitchen he shouted if we're going to cancel the food or we want replacement. We did ask for replacement but he still does the same thing when he serves us the food. We asked for his name and turns his back to us and shouted \"Jose\".  When we're done with our meal, I decided not to call his attention for the bill,  I went straight to the counter to pay. \" By the way, this waiter who serves us have a snake or dragon tattoo on his arms\".  In bill the server name is \"Cola\". Well, this is my worst experience in a restaurant in Chicago and i don't  recommend this restaurant..",

It tasted properly stir fried with the right amount of seasoning and technique. However, I've also been more deeply disappointed on slow days when the dishes are just kind of very low quality and not fresh. The food just didn't seem as live. Well, that's to be expected of most restaurants.  I have really liked its following dishes: black pepper beef short ribs, deep fried whole flounder, salt & pepper shelled shrimp, red roasted quail or squab pigeons, tong choy w/ preserved tofu paste + jalapenos, tong choy w/ shrimp paste, yellow chives and cod fillet, fresh steamed oysters, and deep fried salt & pepper squid or calamari.",
