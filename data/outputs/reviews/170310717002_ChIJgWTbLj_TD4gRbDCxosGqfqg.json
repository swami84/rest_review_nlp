There are lots of options including vegan options that see-saw between Korean and Mexican which I loved. I ordered three tacos- the Vegan Forastero, the Bulgogi one, and the Cameron one. Each one was exciting bite by bite and loaded with filling--They also did not skimp on filling these tacos thankfully which I worry about when spending $4 on a taco. The cameron taco was my favorite due to the sauce on it. It was sweet, savory, a little sour, a little spicy, and super creamy. Contrasted with the crunchy breaded shrimp was incredible. I hardly write reviews but felt compelled to after eating here.",

We ordered the three vegan tacos, kimchi fries, rice and beans and the horchata. The kimchi fries were good and the rice and beans were flavorful with the slight smoky taste but the tacos were under seasoned. We had to add loads on salt to make them palatable. I hope they improve on the taste and I will definitely try the place again. I definitely want to encourage restaurants that have vegan items on the menu. Another minor note but the individual taking our order wasn't particularly helpful or welcoming. Again, might just be having a bad day but affected the experience a little bit. I did like the menu and wouldn't mind going back for the rice and beans",

This place did not disappoint at all with quality in food, service and value. My friends and I ordered everything from the kalbi bibimbap, kim chi fries, Korean wings, Korean bbq sandwhich, horchata, ga fish, porky pig, sesame kalbi and the kiss tacos. The tacos I mentioned are a must order. Meats are well seasoned, cooked perfectly and theres plenty of meat. Its asian fusion at its best. The wings were average in size, but the sauce was a lil too tart and thick. Piping hot and still very good. The bibimbap and kim chi fries are a must order as well. The combination of flavors and the hot bowl were perfect. It was so good that between the 8 of us we were fight between the last grain of rice. The fries are packed with plenty of meat and kim chi. If you love this combination of flavors definitely order this dish.  Overall, this is a great place to come for lunch or dinner. We saw people placing a bunch of carry out orders. The location itself is staffed very well and kept very clean. Food came out really quick and we loved our experience. I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in town to try more of their dishes.",

Oh,  we also had the Kim chi fries which are like nacho/stacked/ loaded potatoes.   Very yummy.   A little spicy but not too spicy.   Gluten free options.   Vegetarian options",

Everything about the food at Forastero is done perfectly: the flavors, the textures, the freshness of the ingredients, did I mention the flavors? The tamales were some of the best I've ever had (two for $6 is a steal!) The pork in the tamales was tender, perfectly fatty, generously portioned, and seasoned to perfection. The wings and the kimchi fries are the bomb. All of the tacos are awesome- great flavor and ingredient combinations (but the Crispy Fish taco is hands down the best). There's plenty of seating, they have daily specials, and they're BYOB! Service is quick and friendly, and you can tell the owner really cares about his patrons and his business. I will continue coming here and will rave to everyone I know about this hidden gem in Chicago.",

They were both OK, lightly seasoned and rather dry. Everyone was content with their food, but it's certainly not a place I'd seek out: at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night they were out of one of their 4 vegetarian items. There was no ice in the soda machine. The table needed a wipe-down. And so on.",

We tried a shrimp taco, a fish taco, and a Korean bbq pork sandwich. All absolutely fantastic. Two very minor complaints: the piece of fish was a little too big to actually eat it as a taco but we didn\u2019t really care because it was so delicious. Also, bread on the sandwich was just slightly too toasted which made for a few very crunchy bites but these things were so minor that the flavors and quality of the food far outweighed them. You\u2019ve got to check this place out!",

The sauce that it comes with is the perfect mixture of sweet and sour. The bowl is very hot and keeps the food hot the entire time. It also helped cook the egg once it was mixed in. I\u2019ve had a few different tacos from here (all of them delish!) but these are the Porky Pig, Sesame Kalbi and Korean BBQ Pork. The meat serving is extremely generous. Each taco combination was very different. All of the flavors mix so well in every bite. I\u2019m already planning to go there for more Bibimop soon!",

My reigning favorite taco is the fish- a very generous helping of nicely fried fish with a real kick  to the sauce. In terms of Korean tacos city -wide, I would say this place is not *quite* as good as Del Seoul or Tacorea (RIP), but it sure beats the hell out of just about everywhere else nearby in terms of flavor-to-dollar value. Next time you're grabbing a bite before heading to the comedy show or the club, skip the $14 burger on Wells and walk the two blocks over here.",
