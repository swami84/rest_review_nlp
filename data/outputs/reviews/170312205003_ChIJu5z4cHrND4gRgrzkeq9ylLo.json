More recently we celebrated a friend's birthday here with a larger party and were so well taken care of. The owner was friendly and checked on us regularly, he even gave us sangria on the house! I really enjoy their mojito/margarita menu, the peach is my favorite. All of the food is amazing - try anything with goat cheese in it because you won't be disappointed. I love the potatoes and we also had a lamb dish that was delightful. Everything on their menu is wonderful if you ask me.  Parking can be tricky but there is a lot behind the blue line and plenty of access to public transportation. Give them a shot if you haven't already!",

We ended up staying wayyy longer than we planned and moved to the bar because we were enjoying our time so much.  The food was great & the sauces had amazing flavor. We enjoyed the brandy mojito and ever sense have been making our mojitos this way.  We also were treated with a free round of cocktails and dessert!  Environment was relaxing with low lighting, but also energetic with lots of laughter.  We will definitely be returning!",

My brother and I finally got a chance to check this place out as one of the many restaurants in the heart of Logan Square a block from his apartment. It was late, just before the kitchen was closing but I was amazed by how good they are.  We had the Cordero and Gambas with a bottle of their Sangria. It was clear they took a lot of pride in their food and service and it showed in the quality and very personal service. I wish I could remember the woman who served us, she said the Sangria was her own recipe and wasn't overly sweet like a lot of it can be, I thought it was very balanced and went well with the meal.  The shrimp was excellent and a wonderful accompaniment but I still have to say the Cordero was something to write home about. I highly recommend it and was especially fantastic on the bread.  Unfortunately we were too late to try the custard, but Chocolate Cake and doughnuts were an excellent desert to finish with. I really dislike dark chocolate usually, but this was perfect. The cake was rich but not overly so like I find most dark chocolate cakes to be and the presentation was top notch.  I can't speak to other's experiences, but everyone I know that's gone recently has nothing but good things to say. The prices are very reasonable and I would enthusiastically recommend. I wish I remembered the servers name now (it's been a few days) but she really couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly. Even when another group decided to go else-where with more cafe offerings, she happily suggested other restaurants in the area they might like.  I've worked in Customer Service and Food Service for years. I don't tolerate bad service and my experience at Azucar was exceptional.",
