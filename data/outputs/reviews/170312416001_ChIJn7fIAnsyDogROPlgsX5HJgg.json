This restaurant is so awesome though inside be sure to check it out (especially if you looking for something \"calm\").  There are tapestries and all types of interesting culture adorning the walls including - a fountain!  right in the middle of the dining area (I wish I could hear it now).  But back to the food which is most important here if you cooped up inside and tired of using the microwave!  We LOVE the homemade Hummus (and I hate store bought and never eat that stuff) and the rice has a very good flavor along with all the kabobs Ive eaten there.  A while back I tried a hamburger and it was better than most any other.  It's not the best location to find a parking spot, but so worth it and now you don't have to dine in.  The worse part about this though is you will likely not order the homemade Persian ice cream that is delish (and my young daughter loves it too).  BE SURE to try it because we REALLY need to support our local restaurants and when it's \"all clear\" - RUN to the Caspian for professionally prepared quality food at a price you can afford.  You literally have to take a one day expensive trip to the Persian region to experience this authentic food.  And I can say it because I learned it after practically eating there every day when I worked close by.  Prior to that I never experienced that type of food so let my luck be yours!  Keep them going strong as this a high quality kitchen experience.  Stay strong and see you when the dining room opens again!",

Unfortunately the food I received was tasteless, just like some other comments have mentioned. The chicken was a bit tough and in my opinion it was not fresh. Hummus tasted ok but it was also old. Koobideh taste was nothing special, so overall giving them 3 stars would be very generous. I hope they do better, and if I see some good reviews I'll be back.",

They also give cheese and herb as starter and at least they gave me tea which was awesome with thos cube sugars. So Persian. The owner was super friendly and have me a hand for smashing the dizi. For all Iranian s this is the only place to get dizi in Chicago so don't miss it, for every body else I suggest trying it once. It's a unique food that is fun to prepare and eat. Overall I can give even more than 5 star.",

They have a dish here that seems to be their specialty. It's some sort of braised lamb shank that they mix with a sauce and some vegetables in a special clay jar table side. The whole process adds to the experience and the owner was very proud to serve us this dish. It was very good. Served with some flat bread or rice. The pickled vegetables eaten with it really cut through the heaviness of the meat and brought out all the flavors and spices. Service was a tad slow, but that is normal for a place that isn't super busy. We also had a large table and there probably was only one cook, so it's understandable. (I'm a cook myself). Overall would recommend this place. The people are very nice and the food was good and reasonably priced",
