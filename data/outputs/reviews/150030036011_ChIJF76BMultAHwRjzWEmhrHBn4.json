Come here and try their omakase if you have that adventurous pallet but not recommended for someone that just wants spicy tuna, california roll, salmon, yellowfin on the omakase menu. This place has kama-toro and this was the first time the chef introduced us to this phenomenon toro cut. They also have santa Barbara and hokkaido uni.",

We were lucky enough to get there right as they opened so we were able to be seated without a reservation. That being said I would definitely recommend making a reservation a few days in advance. In terms of parking we heard that parking was limited so we took an Uber from our hotel, I would recommend the same so that you have a more enjoyable time.  As I said the food was amazing, we opted for the chefs choice omakasi nigiri, the one where they keep bringing out the nigiri till you say stop. We spent about $265 for two people which included 12 pieces of sashimi per person, two tamago, one roll and one custard. All of the food was amazing and it was quite the experience tasing a few fish that neither myself or wife had ever tried before. It is a pricey experience but if you are sharing a special event (for myself it was the last night of my honeymoon) then go for it! We personally did not regret it!",

They dont take reservations after 7pm and even then it's only for 4 less people and they go quickly. The food is very fresh and very good, you can eat alot of different dishes and then still be willing to eat more. Anything seafood related would be the best bet. Sashimi,  butterfish, and seafood dynamite are especially good. They have bar seating, tables up front, and a few larger tables in the back for parties of 4.",

But after our appetizer were served, we did not see our server for almost an hour.  There were no refills and no explanation for the delay of main course.  We sat and watch people came in after us and getting their food before us.  Eventually we grabbed our server and expressed our frustrations.  The server offered no compensations and worst of all, no apologies. 5 stars food, 2 stars service",

It's a very popular show. It's a store that doesn't accept reservations after 7pm. Everything is delicious and happy. it's one of my favourite stores. The food tastes great. There are many items for single dishes. So, you can go no matter how many times you go.
