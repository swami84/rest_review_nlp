        "caption": "Love coming here for Chinese food, the dishes remind me of what you would find in a Chinese home made by a popo who spent many hours in the kitchen. The food may seem simple for certain dishes but a lot of preparation time goes into preparing it.  [FOOD] Love the STEAMED RICE NOODLES WITH MIX SAUCE ($5.50)!! The first time I ordered it I had to ask if it was Look Funn, never heard of it as steamed rice noodles. The dish comes out hot which i have never had before but am definitely a fan of now. While the dish is so simple the warm noodles and peanut sauce just compliment each other. At only $5.50 it makes for a great appetizer or combined with their homemade wontons, STEAMED RICE NOODLES WITH WONTONS ($8.95), it makes for a great meal.  [NOTE] Make sure to check out their specials. Certain dishes like the KAU YUK is not always offered because of the amount of time that goes into preparing it. And though I haven't tried it I hope that they are able to offer their JOOK again soon since the winter months are approaching and i have heard so many of the vendors rave about it.  [SETUP] There are several counter spots and chairs in their stall, plus several tables across the way.",

From the fillings to wraps and sauce, these are the kind of ono bites that I could just munch on forever. I always get spicy, which is an oil-based sauce, but I think if you wanted to avoid the oil chef can give you the chili sans oil. If you're craving dumplings (potsticker shape) or wontons (smaller yellow wrapped - just get both), particularly at night or in Kakaako/outside Chinatown, don't hesitate to visit Bo's. I tried some of their other dishes, but found the dumplings and wontons most remarkable. I learned tonight they sell them frozen too so a bulk order might be in my future...",

        "caption": "Hainan chicken is one of my very favorite things to eat and it's really difficult to find in Honolulu. Hainan chicken is a Chinese dish and Khao Man Gai is the Thai version of it. The first time I ever had it was in Portland at a food truck called Nong's Khao Man Gai, and I've forever compared every experience with the dish to what can only be described as simple perfection. Part of me almost wishes I had never had it in the first place because no one has even come close!  My friend Jeffrey and I specifically came to Bo's Kitchen just to try their Hainan chicken. It's a small food booth located in the back of the Ohana Hale Marketplace on Ward Avenue.  Hainan Chicken ($10) - Cold chicken (think very similar to ginger chicken) with sauces, a few slices of cucumber and a hot yellow colored rice. I'm not sure if the rice was seasoned with butter or chicken stock but everything worked together. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was enough to satiate my craving. I actually liked that the chicken was served cold..  Spicy Won Tons ($8.50) - These are not deep fried, but a steamed won ton filled with pork. I thought they were okay but my hubby loved eating the leftovers.  The woman making our food at Bo's Kitchen was really nice and her daughter was so cute! They accept cash and credit cards.",
