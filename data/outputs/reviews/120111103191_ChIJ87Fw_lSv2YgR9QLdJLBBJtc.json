To my luck this place is literally right across from my house and I pass it often. I quickly read the reviews and decided that I\u2019d give them a try once I got off.  I didn\u2019t know they were doing curbside, so I\u2019d initially walked up to the door. I placed my order and she gave me my cupcakes right then. Everyone talked about the pina colada cupcake, so I decided to get two of them. That\u2019s how big my sweet craving was.  I couldn\u2019t wait to finish eating dinner so I that I could indulge in my cupcake. The icing was good. It wasn\u2019t over powering with sweetness and I loved the touch of the coconut flakes on the top. I love coconut. As for the cupcake itself, I wasn\u2019t impressed. Don\u2019t get me wrong it was good but it tasted nothing like pineapple which it is advertised as a pineapple cake. If I hadn\u2019t seen it for myself, I could\u2019ve sworn that I was given two vanilla cupcakes because that\u2019s what it tasted like. I kind of wish I would\u2019ve just went to NBC and got my lemon cake.  I can\u2019t say that I won\u2019t be back but it won\u2019t be anytime soon.",

I quickly looked them up on Google and was blown away with how beautiful the shop looked and the food looked yummy. I quickly turned around and headed to the store. The shop looked exactly as pictured. They offered some great flavor combinations.  We decided to share a chocolate cupcake with nutella frosting because we've been disappointed by other shops in the past. The cupcake was very moist and had the perfect chocolate flavor. The icing was amazing. Not overly sweet but packed with flavor. Before leaving we purchased a box to go. They named the shop perfectly because this sweet gem was a total surprise.",
