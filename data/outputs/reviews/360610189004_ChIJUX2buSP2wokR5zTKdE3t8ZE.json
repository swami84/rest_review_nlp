We opened the rest of our food and immediately noticed that they gave us vegetable fried rice instead of shrimp. We called again, and they refused to bring the rice and said we received the right food. We contacted Seamless, who told the restaurant to bring us the food, but didn't have an ETA. It took ONE HOUR for the rice to arrive. By that time the rest of our food was cold and we didn't truly want the food anymore. Waste of time and money. Ready to ask Seamless for a refund.",
