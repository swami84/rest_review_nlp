We were both hungry and decided that rather than driving all around the city, we would find somewhere that we could walk to.   Yindee was a little further than we wanted to go but we were intrigued by the sushi/thai combo that they advertised and it was basically on the way back to the hotel so we decided to give them a shot.   We were both totally delighted with everything that we had!   We ordered a few small things to start from both menus but ended up not only getting some food to go but having lunch there the next day before we got out of town.   The prices were amazingly cheap for the portion size and the entire staff was very friendly and accommodating.   Strangely, we were one of only 2 tables full in the entire tiny restaurant.

It was decent, but the flavor was very mellow. i also tried Penang curry and basil chicken, and again very subtle flavors. I couldn't taste the basil at all in the basil chicken. I do give then credit, though, for putting this together. I asked for this specifically since it wasn't on the menu. But then again, catfish WAS on the menu but they didn't have it, so they owed me one.",

They offer the usual sushi suspects, like dragon or rainbow rolls, plus Thai curries and noodles all beautifully plated and reasonably priced.  My favorite items include the tofu pad thai and spicy tuna rolls, but, if you're looking to try something more unique, the scallop nuggets are a must!  Yindee is BYOB, affordable, and complete with great service and ambiance. Hop on the Brown Line and let Chicago's most scenic train do all the work.  It's so easy to locate, right off the Addison stop, that even a Chi town newbie can handle getting there.",

Fish is very fresh and well-prepared. Mini maki rolls are only $5. I LOVE spicy salmon skin mini roll. From the specialty roll menu I love the Tornado roll. Sushi Special is a great bargain at $15: 8 pieces of nigiri and a mini roll, and you can pick your own. They deliver too! Great spot.",
