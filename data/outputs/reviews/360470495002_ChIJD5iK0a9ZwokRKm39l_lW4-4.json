When I entered around 1:30PM, the restaurant was entirely empty. There were 6 2-people tables as well as a 6-person long tall table as well as around 4 or 6 counter seats facing the outside. While I was there, I also saw a lot of delivery orders and takeout orders. Anyway, I got the drunken noodles with tofu and vegetables, and I noticed on their menu that they have both tofu and fried tofu as options (as well as vegetables). I appreciated that they had tofu and vegetables mixed as an option. Because I noticed both tofu and fried tofu as options, I asked whether tofu and vegetables came with fried tofu. The waitress said no, but she can make it fried tofu, to which I agreed. I also asked for spicy, which was a good move on my part. My food came out quite quickly, and she also asked whether I'd like chopsticks (wooden ones though). I ended up eating it all with a fork though. Anyway, the flavor was great although it was a bit oily, and I liked the tofu as well. It was quite great! The only downside is the ratio of vegetables/tofu to noodle was really bad. There was an overload of vegetables and tofu, definitely not enough noodles. The noodles were perfectly chewy and I really enjoyed them, just wished I had more of it. Anyway, the meal was delicious and I really liked eating it. Service was nonexistent though, and I was randomly charged $0.32 for paying credit card even though nobody warned me.",

The food was done just right very filling,flavorful and the chai tea refreshing. Definitely coming back for other good experience of Thai food and will bring more people with us . Like they say word of mouth is great communication to let a place like this be known. Thank you Blink Thai Brooklyn.",

Very clean restaurant, Newly renovated and very comfortable dining area!!! This is my 7th time eating there and I always feel well (I suffer from a sensitive stomach and I immediately detect food that is not fresh). I will strongly recommend trying the Papaya Salad, The Pad Thai is excellent, The Pineapple fried rice is delicious, The Chicken Stey has a tasty fresh cucumber & peanut sauce and I strongly suggest not leaving before having there outstanding delicious desert the Mango Sticky Rice :) The nice & friendly waitress Ellen will always great you with a beautiful smile & a ice cold water!!! The prices are reasonable and in my opinion it is the best value in the Area for tasty, delicious fresh food!!! Highly recommended.",
