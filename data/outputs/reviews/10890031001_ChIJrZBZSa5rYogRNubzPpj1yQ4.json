I was lured in by my love for both Greek and Indian food. This sounds like a place for me.  We ordered a few drinks and appetizers. The first sign that something was amiss was the unannounced substitution of an order of hummus with an order of samosas. Not really a similar item. The chili chicken and spicy wings were tasty.  Upon selecting entrees, I was informed that the \u201clamb gyros\u201d indeed came from a prepackaged container (think bacon). Hard pass. I ordered lamb kabobs and was informed they do not have any kabobs tonight. That pretty well eliminates half the Greek menu. I ordered a \u201ctraditional Greek salad\u201d and the Chicken Tikka Marsala. I figure those two things naturally go together.  The salad contained 3 olives, maybe 2 small pieces of feta, and iceberg lettuce. Not quite on target. The Tikka was okay, but nothing to write home about. The prepackaged Indian at Costco is better (sadly)... or maybe it\u2019s the same??!!??  The kicker is that we were served \u201cnaan\u201d.  A pile of prepackaged pita with garlic salt is what showed up. To top it all off, three people ordered Biryani, a traditional dish. It showed up with a side of \u201craita\u201d... very thick yogurt raita. Looks like tzatziki to me. When asked, we were told, \u201cit\u2019s the same thing.\u201d The person at my table born in India would strongly disagree.  I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but the others who suffered through this disaster of a meal complained for days. Sadly, I can not recommend anything on the menu.",

I was told that the Chicken Tikka Masala was the most popular Indian dish in both the United Kingdom and the United States, so of course, that's the dish I tried the first time I was there. I was not in the least disappointed. I ordered naan to go with it and liked that so much I ordered another. I shamefully ate ALL of it with no regrets whatsoever. Since then, I have enjoyed the Lamb Korma, the Mali Kofta, and the Shrimp Mykelly, just to name a few. On this most recent visit, I ventured to the Chicken Biryani and found yet another new favorite! I have never once been upset that I ordered one dish and not another as they are all absolutely distinct yet equally AMAZING! Their speciality cocktails are top notch and I love the simple yet inclusive wine offerings!",

We were informed that the owner makes all of the sauces from scratch and to order, and it definitely shows. Our server, Tony, was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.

The Malai Kofta was very flavorful and great for dipping the warm pita bread in. We were told the chef prepares his own spices everyday for his curries and sauces. The restaurant was also very clean and modern with fun mood lighting and music. The wait staff were all incredibly helpful and attentive. What a wonderful new restaurant addition to downtown Huntsville!",
