Honestly this place is one of the best spots I've been to over my previous travels over the U.S. Not only was the sandwiche the best I've had the fries were as well. Ranch is made in house and taste absolutely amazing. The Chef was super nice and everyone who worked there were super friendly. This place doesn't lack in any area. This place deserves way more than a 5 star review.",

When looking for it, we asked a guy heading into QG, which happened to be the chef! The place is so cozy and the service was fantastic. Every employee who walked by asked if we needed anything. The food is FANTASTIC. Really. Get the buffalo style fried chicken sandwich with the fries and ranch. The blue cheese dressing and ranch is housemade! The chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The chef brought out our food and recommended places to go while visiting. Also, theres a game room right next to the restaurant which has a lot of games. Honestly, one of the best restaurants I've been too and already am planning to go multiple times during my stay. Would rate it more than 5 stars if I could. I can not put into words how much I love this place.",
