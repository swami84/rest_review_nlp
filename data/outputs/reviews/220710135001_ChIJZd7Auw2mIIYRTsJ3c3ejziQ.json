All dishes were scrumptious and generous in their portions. The service was extremely attentive without being intrusive. The ambiance was relaxed and a bit old-school.  By the way, the restaurant participates in the New Orleans Coolinary program and its full menu is available.  This one is a keeper!!",

The placement of our table was such that the influxes of people waiting at the front were constantly brushing against us. On one occasion someone with their back turned against the table accidentally dipped their jacket into my wife\u2019s dinner, and on a second occasion a different person\u2019s coat touched the top of her wine glass.  If the restaurant owners had an expectation of large groups crowding into the front of the restaurant, they should not be seating people in that spot. Alternatively, the restaurant staff could ask large groups of people to wait at the bar rather than huddled beside an occupied tables.  It was difficult for our server to access us through the mosh pit of patrons waiting to be seated.  I am thankful I finished my entr\u00e9e before the crowds started surging in, as the lamb was done very nicely. My wife was not so lucky, and did not finish her meal before the crowds arrived!  The meal went from an enjoyable experience to a laughable one. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

The Coolinary menu (available in Aug.) is extensive, offering several choices on all three courses, for pretty much $39. A few items are slightly higher. Easy access if you are in the French Quarter, highly recommend. I tried both the seafood martini and bbq shrimp for apps (bbq shrimp took that round); the surf and turf (filet and crabcake) and drum with shrimp and crabmeat for entrees, and finished with the white chocolate bread pudding and chocolate bourbon pecan pie. I was, of course, sharing with a friend.",

The food was good, but a lot of the menu is more Italian than Creole. The staff was nice and friendly but overwhelmed with the workload. The dining room was basically an acoustic arms race with the groups in the center getting louder and louder and it was impossible to have a conversation at the table. We all walked out of there with ringing ears. The acoustics is a mechanical problem of the dining rooms that can and should be fixed.

Despite its proximity to some of the more touristy elements of the French Quarter, it was relatively quiet for the time and day.  We spent just shy of 4 hours here. Jason and Giuseppe were tending bar and did a fantastic job representing the restaurant. We had 5 dishes - Oysters and scallops for apps, whole fish and cioppino for entrees, and a bourbon pie for dessert. The cioppino was a little thicker than they make it in SF (this is a good thing, in my opinion - I dislike the brothy tomato flavor that seems to be embraced out there). Shrimp and scallops were grilled Cajun-style (clear burn marks from the grill) and seasoned very nicely.  Everything was well-executed with an attention to detail. I'd unreservedly recommend this to anyone looking for a quieter place to eat. Prices are not unreasonable at all, though you will pay a bit more here than elsewhere.",

We attempted to dine here the night before but opted to wait and try them tonight instead.  The manager relayed to us he was afraid our experience would not be as great as they would like because they were unexpectedly working very short staffed that evening. He did not turn us away but let us decide. We decided to try again later in our trip. He gave us his card for when we came back. I very much appreciated his honesty as I too have worked in the service industry and totally understand his situation. He was so kind and the menu and ambience of the place definitely felt charming and elegant and I knew we would love to try to dine here this trip. Upon our return the next night, the manager remembered us and made our experience there even more wonderful than I\u2019d imagined by treating us to drinks and appetizers! Our waiter and all the staff were so friendly and attentive to every detail. The food was really delicious and the many layers of flavors in each dish were meticulously crafted and presented beautifully.  I enjoyed the baked oysters appetizer and the bread was so good too. Baked oysters are often baked too long and these were perfect. My entree was the Trio of Duckling and my husband enjoyed the Whole Crispy Gulf Fish (Yellow tail snapper)with scallops and shrimp in a citrus chili sauce with rice. I really love duck and anytime I see it on any menu, it means I have to order it and if it is on the menu more than once or different preparations are offered, then I really struggle to decide. That is why this Trio of Ducking is so perfect! I savored every bite of having duck three different ways in one dish! My favorite of the trio was the Asian barbecue duck. It was unique and satisfied an adventurous duck craving I didn\u2019t really know I was missing out on until tonight. The Warm white chocolate bread pudding for dessert was really hard to share with my husband because it was that good! Not too sweet and again it had many layers of flavors working together in each bite that make it hard not to make audible noises of sweet satisfaction. Truthfully, The Pelican Club impressed us all on it\u2019s own outside of the manager\u2019s generosity when we returned. However, it did make our 13th Anniversary even more special that night! The manager and wait staff were outstanding! We will be back for sure! And it\u2019s at the top of our recommendations for our friends and family to experience! I only regret that I did not remember the names of the staff and manager to thank them more personally!",

There were few people seated at this time but it was already extremely noisy with a large group in an adjoining room. We asked if they could move us to a quieter table and they seemed very resistant but we persevered and we eventually moved to a more quiet room. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable but it seemed to take a long time for anything to happen. We weren't in a hurry at all but in several instances the wait for a drink or a course was excessive. Once the room we were in filled up it was also Very noisy. Everyone in the group had the four course fixed price dinner. We had a variety of appetizers, main courses and desserts. All of the food was quite good. I would not go back because of the noise level. The restaurant is expensive and there are certainly better ones in and around the French Quarter for the price.",

The place wasn't completely full and there were 3 empty tables for 2 that I spotted during my trip to the bathroom. At the bar, the bartender basically ignored us for 15 minutes until I asked for a menu. The menu had a vegan soup and a vegan entree, so forget about doing prix fixe if you have a dietary restriction involving dairy or fish. The house bread is dusted with parmesan and even though I asked for no cheese and stated that dairy makes me ill, my pasta arrived with cheese. They replaced it quickly, so at least there's that. My companion was treated to overcooked seafood. Rubbery clams, scallops, oysters and crab legs tells me the kitchen is as badly managed as the rest of the place. The decor was nice and the bathrooms were clean, but the nose level was too loud for conversation and the layout didn't offer any privacy or sensation of intimacy. The dishes and drinks were overpriced for what they were. I can't recommend this restaurant for anyone with food allergies or dietary restrictions.",

The staff were friendly and we had a choice of either dining in the main restaurant, decorated in traditional New Orleans style, or in the bar area which was a little less formal. We chose the latter and had a good window seat and view of what was going on outside. Service was attentive and friendly, but thankfully not overly so. Our waiter provided excellent recommendations and we took his advice. Food was first class...in fact, I'd go so far as to say world class, for we have eaten in really good restaurants all over the world. The flounder was wonderful, as was the bourbon creme brule, but the star (for me) was the gumbo. I don't have a reference point for gumbo, this being the first time I've tried it, but it was delicious and something I would make an effort to seek out if/when we return to New Orleans. I thoroughly recommend this restaurant.",

The staff was courteous and the service was good too. The Crab Bisque was delicious, as was the scallop stuffed artichoke. My only recommendation to our server was that there should be more artichoke in the dish. My friend enjoyed her filet. We shared the bread pudding and it too, was delicious. I would definitely prepare my  budget for a fancy dinner here next time I am in NOLA.",

        "caption": "Came here for Thanksgiving dinner with my family and I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. This place seems to be really reaching for an immersive fine-dining feel, but there are some holes in the service that left me unwilling to suspend disbelief. Our waiter (a taller, middle aged man who seemed well established at the restaurant) called me sir multiple times, I'm guessing because I have short hair, even after I corrected him (I am very clearly female and was wearing makeup, jewelry and a dress). He was a little rushed and aggressive, even though the restaurant wasn't even half full, and spilled coffee on the table. At least one person's dish for each course was cold when it got to the table, and some plates seemed hastily thrown together, with fingerprints and smudges left on. To me the inconsistencies in the dining room speak to a lack of coordination and leadership in the kitchen. I don't know if this was specific to the prix fixe menu they were doing at the time, but most of our entrees, all different menu items, came out with the same vegetables and components besides the protein, such as bland green beans that could have been out of a can, and some repeats of sauces and purees. It seemed that no thought had been put into the cohesiveness of each individual dish, which leaves the diner feeling like half their plate was an afterthought.  All of this might be acceptable at a more casual and affordable restaurant, but I would expect an establishment like the Pelican Club to have these kinds of things smoothed out, just considering the level of dining they seem to be aiming for. A perfect example is the fact that our server used one of those little crumb scrapers on our table just long enough for someone in our group to comment \"oh, fancy!\" and then left, leaving most of the table still covered in crumbs. Obviously nobody NEEDS all the crumbs scraped off their tablecloth after every course, but if you're going to go to the trouble to get the scraper out, finish the job. And don't serve half the food cold.  I am only taking the time to write all of this out because I believe that if it gets its act together a little bit, it could have the potential to rival Commander's. A lot of the food (minus the soups, which tasted washed out and fridge-y, and the previously-complained-about green beans) is really, really good. The mushroom ravioli especially knocked it out of the park, even at lukewarm. The escargot were phenomenally classic. I thought the bread pudding couldn't possibly live up to the hype from our server, but it was truly delectable. I think with stronger management in back, a more confident menu, and more thorough service out front, this place could seriously impress me. I look forward to visiting again one day in the future to see if they've figured it out.",

I had been given a gift certificate by my son who works as a concierge at one of the high end hotels in New Orleans, as a thank you for sending so many hotel guests to The Pelican Club.

When the bill came we ended up giving her 10% by mistake instead of 20% (she should have gotten 0% because of her bad attitude.)  Long story short she came back to the table and pressed me to answer why we just left her 10% and that the brandy must have made me mess up my numbers!  My God!  I've never had that happen to me before.  Horrible attitude.  I phoned the mgr. and the owner was supposed to phone me but he apparently didn't care enough to bother with it.

Our evening started with the strawberry-lemonade cocktail and a pour of the Old Rip bourbon.  We started with the ahi poke and the baked oysters.  Both nice flavors, balanced.  Our entrees: Seared tuna and scallops and Trio duckling were enjoyable but very mediocre.  Nothing very exciting. The scallops were quite bland and the shredded duck was mushy and boring.  Our desserts: chantilly cake and chocolate cake were very delicious and we quite enjoyed those very much especially with the bottle of Caymus.  Overall with the amount that we spent in money and time, we would have hoped to have had a more interactive service.  We left at closing and the hostess that let us out was very gracious to provide us some wonderful bars to continue our evening.",

The bisque soup was good, but that's about the only thing that I would rate good.

Our waitress recommended some Oysters for the appetizer and we had that and the crabcake - both were very good.  For entrees we I had their duck and my wife had the lamb, both of which were very good.  The desserts were very good as well.  Overall we both thought the food was very good - the only complaint was that the asparagus was a little salty - but not inedible.  The restaurant is much bigger than it looks - it has several rooms.  We both found the service to be very good.  When our waitress was busy with another table, a different staff member served us - which was much better than letting our food sit around and get cold.  The only other hiccup with our experience was that TPC put us down as a no-show through OpenTable - but that OpenTable resolved that for us.  I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend The Pelican Club for dinner.",
