This particular evening, we didn't have a reservation, so were seated at a table in their bar area.  I found it to be really noisy and the service not quite as good as what we've had in the past in the main dining room.  Felt a bit forgotten.  Also found the seared foie gras to be pretty mushy and meh in flavor.  Perhaps we should have splurged for the more expensive chilled version.  Alas....  The steaks were great as always, though.",

The quality of the sushi seems to be alot better than that of the usual sushi buffets too, and the pricing is more worth it for the amount. They have this combo option where u pay $10 as a seating price that includes a salad and a soup. With the combo, u pay the cheaper price for all of the other items on the menu like rolls or appetizers. So the pricing for a sushi roll is just around the range of $1-$3, which isnt bad at all. And u just order accordingly since it isnt \"unlimited\" and this way,  the chances of over ordering is slightly lower too (coming from personal experience with sushi buffets...\ud83d\ude05). Despite there being slightly less options in their menu compared to sushi buffet menus, there is still a good variety in rolls and appetizers to pick, which is just perfect. Overall, I enjoyed my visit here and will most likely come again.\ud83d\udc4d",

I came here when I saw a friend come for the grand opening. Its an interesting concept.. so its kinda like all you can eat sorta? You pay 10 dollars lets say \"entrance fee\" You get An app and soup.  After you can order off their menu for the \"admission price\" instead of the regular price. lets say a 3 piece salmon sushi is 3 dollars it would be 1 dollar after you pay the entrance fee Edamame is 5 dollars it was 1 dollars after the fee  its a pretty interesting concept so you kinda pay more as you eat but when you order... about 3 entress you paying 30-40 bucks vs you paying 10 dollars for the fee then ordering 2-3 entress at maybe 3-4 dollars?  still not bad place is organized when it comes to your order try it out",
