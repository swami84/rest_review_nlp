The plating also works against them and their choice of table size, so be prepared to balance things on the edges of the table if you order more than 2 plates. Brunch was pretty horrible; it's like they are afraid of salt.. The breakfast potatoes were very... \"al dente\" not in an enjoyable way and the eggs were very overcooked and rubbery.  I feel like a little quality control here would really turn things around because the menu is strong, just poorly executed.",

I may change my review if I go again, bc I only tired the risotto balls and the spaghetti, which both lacked flavor. An Italian restaurant, its the assumption that the actual Italian food, i.e., spaghetti, is better than anything you can get from anywhere. Like I said, I may go back and next time I hope whatever I order, it tastes better.",

While the appetizers were delicious, I have to say the rest of the meal was just ok. The salads were boring (beet salad and iceberg with prosciutto/grapes). For the main course the pork chop was so overcooked it was a challenge to cut with the steak knife, and the seafood pasta was so spicy I could barely eat it. It seems like there was something going on in the kitchen because the wait between salad course and main course was very long, and perhaps the chop sat under a heater for too long (thus overcooked). Overall, the space is nice and the server was attentive. But I won\u2019t make it a point to hurry back anytime soon.",

There is such depth of flavor n the meatballs- the sauce is perfect, and the pasta is al dente.  There is plenty of sauce, and the overall portion is hard to kill in one sitting.  My wife loves the chicken parm, which is 2 nice-sized, breaded and seared chicken breasts over that same excellent pasta\u2013 with lots of mozzarella, and tons of flavor.  We have both enjoyed the pizza, which is a flat-bread, Italian style.  And the brussels sprouts are also spot-on delicious.  The cauliflower is spiced on the very neutral side, so I would only order that again as a foil alongside a very spicy entree.  Prices are super reasonable, so I'm sure that Saba will endure and become a staple of our great neighborhood, Logan/Avondale!  :-D",

The osso bucco was overwhelmed by lemon that made it unpalatable. The ribeye special was unseasoned and tough. The papardelle was flavorless, unseasoned, and cold. Similarly the lobster ravioli was unappetizing. A glass of wine we ordered tasted like raisins, not a cabarnet. Management did try to rectify some issues by providing another entree and a complimentary dessert. The restaurant has interesting ideas, but the execution was very poor and I will not return.",

Our server greeted and took an order from a table that sat down AFTER us, and we didn\u2019t get greeted or served water until about 10 minutes after sitting. Our drinks took almost as long as the food, and our appetizer came out at the same time as the entrees. We ordered the Spanish octopus (which was almost impossible to cut through and over cooked), the half chicken (which was served with what seemed like old potatoes and a pile of bell peppers?), and a steak dish. I can\u2019t understand how this restaurant is full in a neighborhood with so many great dining options. Would strongly recommend not spending money here.",

Very good watercress salad big enough to share, and delicious share-size mushroom pizza with a variety of cheeses and a bit of truffle oil. (For my taste, they could add a bit more of that oil!) Meatballs in the spaghetti -- tender and big -- were made of veal and seasoned just right. Beet salad was lovely, cooked perfectly, and generously portioned. Because all the food arrived at once when we were there, rather than staggered with salads first, the waiter offered a complimentary dessert to make up for the error. The only marginal element was the outdoor table and chairs. The metal chairs are not comfortable, and the tables don't fit together properly when placed side by side.",

We greated warmly and seated right away.  Our waiter came over right away.  This is where my review takes a turn.  After asking a few questuons about drinks we order drinks and then move over to the appetizers.  We attempted to order calamari and rizzuto balls. My wife said we would like the Calamari and Rizzuto balls. The waiter then simply said yes those are appetizers I said we know that us what we would like for right now.  The appetizers come and we are done before the waiter returns to take our main course order.  We order white fish and eggplant parm.  The food was ok.  Nothing for me to say I'll come back or I'll definitely tell my friends to try this spot.  So all that to say we paid for ho hum food, not so good service and a decent atmosphere.

I would not eat here again but it seems the drinks are at least good. But what\u2019s good drinks without good food? Had the calamari - wasn\u2019t very crunchy and even the sauce wasn\u2019t flavorful just very generic. Goat cheese was served with burned, hard toast (menu says focaccia). Had gnocchi with pesto - hard to mess up. They messed it up. Gnocchi was rubbery and dense and they poured on a gallon of pesto to cover it up. Normally wouldn\u2019t complain about extra pesto except it was way way too salty. Technically it was grilled chicken gnocchi pesto but there was so little chicken they may as well left it off. Had a few other dishes as well but can barely remember them because they were so forgettable.  Even their own website as of 6/18/19 misspells prosciutto as prosiotto making you question if you\u2019re even getting real meat.  Atmosphere: It\u2019s supposed to be an Italian restaurant but they just decided to do generic modern American restaurant decor with random succulents hanging everywhere as I assume an attempt to fit into the neighborhood.  My prediction: this will either be a complete menu or concept overhaul or completely gone by next year. The only thing saving it is the location by the Logan Square blue line.  The only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1 is because it\u2019s so hard to open a restaurant so I give them credit for just opening.  I saw in another review that they went through staff changes including the head chef. This may be why the older reviews are good.",

Now let's go over what I ordered because now you're going to want to come here this week.  I picked two winners tonight; I chose a well prepared gnocchi which came with grilled chicken, grilled red peppers and fresh pine nuts and the Italian soda. I chose a non alcoholic version which was made with seltzer water, strawberry gelato and orange soda syrup.  It was decadent, refreshing and colorful. I absolutely loved my beautiful gnocchi but I wish there had been a non meat version.  When I perused the menu I didn't pay close attention to the ingredients listed so I hope this lovely restaurant can alter their menu in the future and offer a meatless version of gnocchi for a slightly lower price to accommodate vegetarian tastes too. I also noted they have very tempting salads but again the prices ate listed as $10 and over and I feel if you intend to order a dinner the restaurant should accommodate you with a half order of salad for half the price or as an add on option to your main course.  Bread is not included here but when I asked my server for bread he graciously made some crispy bread for me. I hope this wonderful establishment will consider offering a few slices of complementary bread to their diners who are ordering a main meal because bread isn't costly to make and everyone typically enjoys using bread to sop up remaining sauces in their pasta dish. I'll definitely repeat and I was very pleased altogether with my experience.  I hope the owner or manager will take my suggestions to heart.",

We were curious about SABA when walking the neighborhood in the past. At this time of the night we decided to try it since the other nearby options were a Mexican restaurant we weren't impressed with previously and a fast food restaurant that we wanted to avoid. We walked into SABA with our luggage, the restaurant was clearly emptying, but there were still people at the bar and tables. The host greeted us and, without our asking, he told us where to put the luggage safely out of the way. A waitress then promptly took our order, made some suggestions, and we sat down to brussel sprouts, a tomato and cheese side dish, pizza, and a bottle of wine. The food was delicious, but the wine didn't measure up to our California favorites (Russian River wines). Nonetheless, the rest of the meal was outstanding and we appreciated the considerate service.  We will be back and can recommend the restaurant.",

Unfortunately, in my TWO attempts to eat here in the last two weeks, I didn't get taste one bite.  Several weeks ago, they had the ENTIRE dining room booked for an event, and the only seats available were the bar or the tiny cocktail tables. We had a party of four, so neither was an option, and we had to choose some place else. At that point, it was what it was. Logan Square has so many great places to eat, we weren't going to cry because we weren't able to be accomodated that night.  When we finally got the chance to try this place for real several days later, enough had happened prior to ordering that we decided to get up and leave. First, we were seated for 15 minutes before a server came to bring us water or take drink orders. I've worked serving tables before, so I started paying attention to what was taking so long, and it turned out that she was in the weeds: she was the only server in the entire place and had every table (which almost all were full). Once she finally did get to us and we order drinks, she brought us practically clear cokes. The taste matched the color (weak), so I mentioned to her that they may need to change the syrup in the machine, to which she replied \"but that is going to take me like 10 minutes because it is all the way downstairs.\" I told her that was fine, and I would appreciate that she tried because that is the drink I wanted. She came back about 1 minute later and said that \"its just our coke. We get weird complaints about it all of the time, and I think it is just ours.\" I laughed inside. Are you kidding? I mean, really, kidding? Whatever. I'll drink the watered down coke, thanks for \"trying\" because you and I both know that you didn't even check. So now we are ready to order, and I should have known better to let the abnormal wait times, the watered down coke, and the poor service be a precursor: she announces that they are out of essential menu items that accounted for half of our table's meals LOLOL. No words. We left, and I won't be making a third attempt.",

I came by at 330 before dinner was served but the cod aranchini was light appetizer and pretty filling about 3-4oz balls. I had their bar burger and it was very good. Even though I'm just visiting chicago for food adventures I would gladly come back to try their dinner menu. Just based on the happy hour menu alone I was left satisfied and happy.

Easily my favorite dish. For the second entree we had the chicken parmesan.  Instead of being served on top of angel hair or another pasta it was served on a bed of polenta. I was not a fan of the polenta, it just made me think of grits too much.",
