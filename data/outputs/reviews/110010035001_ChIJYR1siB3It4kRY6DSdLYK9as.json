The paint and accompanying murals make it easy to spot especially since they sit in an area lined with row houses. It was very hot outside and we were lucky enough to call them and get seating within 15 minutes.  Coming in, the spot has a great old world energy and a good layout. There is an antique register at the bar and authentic plates from Naples decorated on the wall. There is also a coffee bar at the other end of the restaurant which looked enticing. The dining area was split off per social distancing guidelines and we were seated close to the bar. The staff was friendly and were gracious hosts. I felt well attended. The menu was small but that is a hopeful sign that the dishes that are offered are well done and thought out.  We ordered drinks, appetizer, two dishes and dessert. Drinks were both very tasty, I had a bourbon drink with bitters, my girlfriend had a summery drink with aperol. Appetizer was the eggplant parmesan along with complimentary bread and olive oil. Tasty. My girlfriend especially enjoyed it. Main dish was an Old Bay pasta with crab meat and braised beef with pasta. All of the food was very good, fresh, and made to order. My girlfriend doesn't like lemon and the old bay pasta was very zesty so we ended up switching plates. I liked it. The braised beef was great as it was not too saucey and the beef managed to stay juicy. Not sure what exact cut the beef was but I know it has a tendency to be stringy and dry. Not the case here. Both dishes had perfectly cooked al dente pasta. For dessert I had the tiramisu with an espresso and she had the flourless chocolate cake with a scoop honey and fig gelato. Both were great and I especially loved the tiramisu. It was rich while not being too wet which made it memorable to me.  Overall, the experience was positive. I enjoyed being out of the house talking to people that were easy to talk to, expressed passion in their restaurant, and took steps to make us feel welcome. I would recommend Napoli Pasta Bar to my friends for an authentic Neapolitan dining experience that does not involve pizza.",

It was an average Friday crowd and they still had DC restaurant week menu options available. The laggy service exacerbated by only having the one server carrying plates up and down stairs. Bussing the the tables was just as awkward with all kinds of clumsy reaching and elbows. To top it off, there was no attempt to refill drinks, even when someone specifically asked for another glass of wine, everyone else was sitting with empty glasses.

We shard both dishes as food is pricey, most items in the teens and portions are not big, However , everything is made from scratch and you do not feel stuffed after eating, more satisfied. The caprese salad was excellent with fresh tomatoes, mozeralla and basil and seasoned appropriately. The ravioli meat dish was ok, the red sauce tasted a bit overcooked, but it was late in the dinner hour. I think plain ravioli with a side of sauce would have been a better choice. The restaurant should simplify their menu, although authentic to Italy, I think they would attract more of the locals. And lower prices.   Our bill was $39 before tip fir two dishes.  Also, no kids menu. Or they could go more family style with larger plates of food. If money is no object, it\u2019s worth the experience.",

Not a morsel of food was spared.  t's pretty cozy so get here early or make a reservation. We got there right at 4:30pm opening time and luckily could do a walk-in as the restaurant was all booked up!  My hubby enjoyed the Brigante aged rum cocktail so much he got around round! The bartender had a heavy poor the 2nd time around.  The complementary Rosemary Focaccia bread served with first-press olive oil was divine. The bread was so soft and fluffy with a thick crust on top, we definitely got a refill!  The Melanzane de Eggplant was scrumptious with fresh smoked mozzarella, ricotta cheese, San Marzano tomato, and layers of eggplant. It's worth saving room for the appetizer. Highly recommend it!  The Tagliatelle al Porcini with black truffle ($8 upcharge - totally worth it!) was scrumptious. The long noodles were cooked al-dente in a olive oil, parmesan cheese, and garlic sauce. The porcini mushrooms complemented the noodles and elevated the flavor. While the black mushrooms were a nice add-on, the dish was good enough to stand on its own.  My hubby got the Fish of the Day, which the server kindly debone. There were a few small pieces of bone, so just be careful. He thoroughly enjoyed the well-cooked fish which was elevated with sweet cherry tomatoes soaking up the juices. We couldn't remember the unusual name of the dish, it wasn't catchy, but similar to a Cod. The side of sauteed spinach was tasty and paired well.  While we were stuffed and failed to save room for dessert, the decadent Tiramisu was well worth it! The layers of moist lady fingers sandwiched in mascarpone cheese with rich chocolate chips and topped with expresso was heavenly!  This homey restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Columbia Heights and 5 stars in my book! Excited to come back and will make a reservation!",

I saw a few reviews complaining about portion size and price but can't agree they should impact the rating. Yes, the portions aren't huge like you're at the Cheesecake Factory but you'll certainly be full. The prices are a bit premium (maybe a dollar or two more per item). However, the owner and staff clearly put a lot of effort into making the place friendly and welcoming. They also try to create a sense of community that is sorely lacking in this area; greeting passers by and remembering their customers by name. Napoli can gladly have my extra $5 and keep the extra 2 bites of food every day of the week in exchange for bringing those qualities to the neighborhood. They run a place neighbors want to go to and are happy to have in the community.",

The ambiance was awesome and the food to pair was amazing! The cod and octopus entree is to die for! The canoli desert was delicious. The owner, Antonio, came by several times to our table to make sure everything was going well, which to me makes a big statement.
