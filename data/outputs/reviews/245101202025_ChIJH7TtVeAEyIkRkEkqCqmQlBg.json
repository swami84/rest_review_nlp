There was 1 slice of one mushroom. A few small fingernail sized onion bits. And enough cheese to know it had been placed, but not enough to feel or taste it, at all. They REALLY skimped on the toppings. If i had mushroom onion or cheese in more than one bite, this would be a great burger. Brought down by frugality. Shame.",

The indiam man who received my order told me I cannot add any of the free toppings (as it says on the menu). I have never had this issue and could add the toppings how much I wanted before. If you are not giving the free toppings anymore then you should remove it from the menu.  I also asked for some water, for which I know they give a small plastic cup, but this man charged a full regular fountain drink. All in all, it isn\u2019t much, but the burger place seems to be very focused on making money regardless of how bad they make a customer feel or by changing their own policies.  I think I won\u2019t go there again untill they go back to before or at least have a reasonable service. The burgers arent bad but I would say that literally any burger bistro in mt vernon or fells point is at the very least the same or better (ex coopers tavern, abbeys burger bistro, etc...)",

Along with Hand cut French Fries or Poutine they offer the St. Paul Burger, the Build a Burger - you decide the Ranch Burger, The Veggie Burger Falafel s Salads Chicken Caesars' Salad and more. He really does well with the delivery with Grub Hub and several others. He's a go to guy for Burgers with the delivery apps. When driving here use your navigation system and your intuition maybe even an alley shortcut and some caution. The streets will helps your appetite drivers. When you leave you might end up going in another direction than you thought. It's a groovy time continuum. This is fun food on the corner at 31st. That's why I call him Bozzy Bo Z. OK Boss.",
