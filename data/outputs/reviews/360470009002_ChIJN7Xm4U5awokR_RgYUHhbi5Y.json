I read some of the bad reviews and some are clearly fake as they mention dishes not found here and make it sound like this is a chain. It\u2019s not. And the owner takes pride in his food as does his cooks. Despite me being in a wheelchair and thus rather inconvenient of a customer as the place is a literal hole in the wall. No space for anything - they bend over backwards making me comfortable. Reminds me of the hole in the wall places back when I lived in Texas. So good. But you\u2019d never know it by the looks.",

Ive ordered from other locations of this place & none were as negative.
