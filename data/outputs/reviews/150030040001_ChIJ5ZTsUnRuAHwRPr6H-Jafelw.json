The combos are a nice deal - I like getting a soup + salad or soup + sandwich. They also cater my office's meetings quite often; they can cater both breakfast (pastries and breakfast sandwiches, plus coffee) and lunch (mostly sandwiches for us). Some of my coworkers have said some of their catered sandwiches a bit boring after a while, so you may consider specifically requesting the types of sandwiches you prefer.",

We use them every time and never once has there been a complaint or issue raised from our trainees about the lunch we provide from 1132 cafe.  My favorite is the chicken walnut salad.  Although I\u2019ve never been to the physical location, the delivery person is always kind, sets out an organized the lunches while I keep teaching, and shows professional courtesy.  Thanks for making catered lunch hassle free!",

        "caption": "all the reviews about the rude lady in the front are true. I had a vegetarian friend that came here and asked about altering a sandwich and she was extremely loud, rude, demanding, \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!?\" so bad i never came back despite working in the next building.  one day i go in to see my favorite korean spot is closed. so i try again.  nice young lady takes my order and i see the rude lady arranging things on the counter behind her, she whip around to look at me. she smiles and i smile back (does she recognize me? I recognize her). Maybe they learned their lesson and let the girls handle the customers and rude lady just gives and receives orders from the kitchen...  i hear them ask the back for my sandwich and someone comes with a bag and they yell out exactly my order. i ask in a surprised tone if that was mine cause I just ordered, and the rude lady says \"HA how can that be yours YOU JUST ORDER!!! HAHAHA\" with her back still turned to me. Not a \"teasing\" type of way that I get with aunties and uncles in Chinatown, but a RUDE RUDE RUDE mocking way, like she's talking to HERSELF as she's facing the wall but meaning for me to hear it.  Now this is probably an instance where they cant find anyone to replace this lady that's probably been working there her whole life/ can't fire her, shop probably still does well based on location convince, and I get it. Some people probably think it's funny (angry korean lady or soup nazi style) but it's a damn shame with such a central downtown location she can't just keep her thoughts to herself and I won't be bringing myself, or my company here.  Why can't they just let the nice young ladies work the front and stop offending everyone - given by the many many 1 star reviews I see here. I give two, only cause of the location. But tbh, like Cynthia N., her rudeness made me lose my appetite and I haven't taken a bite of what I ordered.  ----- Guide to my reviews - 5 = above and beyond what's expected, 4 = Perfect service, 3 = OK service nothing special nothing bad, 2= something was bad, 1= I'm offended",
