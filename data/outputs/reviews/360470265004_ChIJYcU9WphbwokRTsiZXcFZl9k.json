Pinsas are a great portion size and like a light airy pizza with a crackly crust - particularly like the Pecorino e Porri: pecorino, roasted leeks, guanciale. Carciofi and the chicory salad, and the classic \u201calici e burro\u201d is a simple but delicious starter with bread, fresh butter and anchovies.",

We stopped in on Friday around 6 and grabbed a spot at the bar. The vibe was cozy, warm, familial and chic. The bartender (didn\u2019t catch his name) was great-welcoming and helpful. We both got one of their Negroni\u2019s and shared the sardine appetizer and a pizza. It was all fantastic. Considering it was opening weekend, a Friday, and Valentine\u2019s Day, the place got pretty crowded by the end of our dinner. The staff handled it beautifully and nothing seem frazzled or rushed. We can\u2019t wait to come back for the drinks, the pizza, and the vibe!",
