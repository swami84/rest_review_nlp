Now I know it\u2019s a prix fixe so they are trying to simplify things in the kitchen and turn a profit but we got very little food and ALL OF IT CAME OUT COLD including the tenderloin and fish entrees. We let our server know and they took all of our entrees back and they brought them back out still cold! They gave us some prosecco when I asked if there was anything they could do for us but we ended up paying $130+ per person and went home hungry. It\u2019s frustrating because the atmosphere was charming and our waiter tried. I have never paid more for less food. All they had to do to make our night amazing was feed us something warm, well seasoned, and filling.",

I wasn't able to go all the way out on the gangplank and say that it's THE BEST, but it's certainly top five.  The Portugese bun was like a wonderfully soft english muffin, slightly sweet like a Hawaiian roll, but still absorptive enough to handle the runny yolk and grease of the sausage on the sandwich.  Highly recommended with the Merguez patty.",

Beautiful Environment, Organic, Vegetarian, Deliciousness, Kindness and Cleanliness are all keys for me when picking a place to eat. Otway has nearly all of these. Thanks for the hospitality. One missing for me...I would like to see more organic options maked on you menu or some how communicated. I found out at the end of my meal by asking... I may have chosen a different meal had I known. What I eat was good either way. I had to ask and to my surprise, you all have a lot of things that are organic or sustainably sourced (like your wines, which I will be back to try). I wanted the waffle and it was 86 on the waffles the day I went. So you get a 4 stars, for the 86 on the waffles. - @GoddessProsper",

Fine not the best, could have dealt. But...  ...the small half of avocado served had black rotten spots and strings throughout. They did not even bother removing as there wouldn\u2019t have been anything left. They did sprinkle it with sea salt, maybe hoping we wouldn\u2019t notice. If I\u2019m willing to pay $4 for a tiny portion of avocado, then I\u2019m expecting it to be fricken perfect. My boyfriend\u2019s egg sandwich was okay and the coffee was decent.

After we ordered a couple appetizers and told the waiter we wanted to spend some time thinking about our entrees, the waiter came back from the kitchen to tell us that the Chef wants to know our full order and didn't want to do just the appetizers.  In other words, the Chef wanted to rush us.  This is shockingly unacceptable for even the lowliest restaurant.  I have worked as a waiter in a lot of restaurants, and I could not fathom the chef or myself saying anything to a guest that would make them feel rushed.  It's bad for business, as indicated by this review and the fact that we will not return.  The food was also pretty bad.  One of dishes we ordered was the uni (sea urchin) crepe.  Clearly, it was rancid. I have never tasted anything so foul in my whole life.  We told the waiter, who took back the dish.  BUT WE WERE STILL CHARGED FOR IT.  Again, I have had a lot of restaurant experience and when you're paying the kind of prices that Otway charges, you take the dish off the bill no questions asked.  Also, we asked the waiter about the dish before we ordered it and he didn't say anthing about a \"strong\" flavor.  When we said we didn't like it, he said it was a \"polarizing\" dish.  I know the dish was rancid.  But even if it wasn't, the waiter should have said the dish was \"polarizing\" before we ordered it.  Lastly, the drinks were boring.  I ordered some margarita-like cocktail and it tasted like someone sapped it of flavor.  It was muted and uneventful.  The service was bad.  The food quality was clearly bad, as demonstrated by the rancid dish.  And the cocktails are lackluster.",
