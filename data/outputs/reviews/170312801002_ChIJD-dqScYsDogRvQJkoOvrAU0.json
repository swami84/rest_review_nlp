Let me just say the customer service you receive there is amazing! The staff is friendly and gladly goes through any products you have questions on. Unfortunately they have missed the main point of the store. The food... We bought for $70 1 4pack of carrot raisin muffin, 2 tiramisu, 1 veggie rolls and 1 of their home made pesto.  The carrot muffins were horrible...stale, hard and almost inedible. The tiramisu witch is usually my favorite dessert(before I went vegan) was nothing like tiramisu not even close...but was an okay dessert. Would not buy again though. The veggie rolls soggy, old, and the flavors did not complement each other. Don\u2019t waste your money on those! The home made pesto sauce is amazing! 10/10! Overall I will not be returning to this store. I love the idea but is not executed well...at all. Over all their food is over priced and stale/old.",

This is across the board and not what one should expect when you are paying PREMIUM prices for pre-packaged food to go.  Good luck trying to share an opinion or give the owners feedback, they have NEVER returned my calls.  I've tried reaching them 3x over the past 2 years.

It's been only a couple of dollars difference but, at one point, the price had recently changed and I had just enough in cash and then not enough even though the label said the previous price. I pointed this out, especially when their credit card reader was down & the person working couldn't care less. This was for a gift for a friend that I had made a specific trip downtown for & was really embarrassing when other people in line ended up trying to offer me money when I was distraught about it.  I sent an email to the company and literally got no response. The city makes it expensive for small businesses to survive & I get that but when you raise prices like that repeatedly without warning even on the packages and have zero empathy, people will just end up not seeing the benefit of supporting your independent business.",

The one thing I just can't get down with was the chocolate desert cup thing, not sweet at all and in general pretty gross. This place is a little too expensive for daily lunching (a small fresh juice will run you $10), but it is a nice option for switching it up a little and feeling extra healthy.",

Each dish is unique, and raw or mostly raw (some sides, such as the couscous, is partially cooked/steamed), but most important: very well-seasoned and delicious.  They usually offer samples of multiple menu items, even to repeat customers (it helps me decide what I'm in the mood  to eat that day!)  The desserts are especially delectable--I just love that they are made with very healthy ingredients, and not overly sweet.",

So when I've tried in the area Raw really stands out as one of the few places who can cater to a healthier lifestyle. While the prices are a bit much for what you get the taste is fantastic! Not only that but the staff is both friendly and willing to answer any questions on the subject of what is in the food or suggestions that you might have for them.  If I was ever going to try to go vegetarian I know that I'd be spending a lot of time here.",

This small cafe tucked in s corner of the French Market gives you flavor you can savor. All of the salads are great. The raw pizza is delicious & the the empanada entree is my favorite. Try out the sampler if you're a newbie. The raw burger entree,3 for $11, is a must - heck add a salad & you have 3 meals. There's also a bonus! Each entree comes with a raw desert sample...you can't beat that! If you want to do a raw food detox signup for the meal plan. The owners are onsite often and they are two of the most kind, beautiful and helpful ladies that I've met. There's eat raw vegan food then there's RAW the place where you get bang for your buck, if you make the right selection. RAW Chicago rocks!",
