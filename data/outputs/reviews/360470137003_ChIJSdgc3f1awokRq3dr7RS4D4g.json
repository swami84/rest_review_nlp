Someone, not sure if it's the cook or waiter forgot 3 different orders, 2 of which was for one person, while everyone else had plates in front of them. It was busy so we gave them some time (benefit of the doubt, we've worked in restaurants before) I'm about halfway in for my plate amount of time, so we notified the waiter about the misstep, doesn't know what's missing and asks us, don't think they even felt remotely sorry. Everyone else is finished by this point, it finally comes out and no real apologies, says sorry for the delay?? We're literally done with our food, this is no delay. I think an actual apology for forgetting 3 different orders is reasonable. Water was never re-filled either.",

This restaurant replaced Corner Burger (which is still on Google Maps in case anyone is wondering) and it's a welcome addition to the plethora of Sushi restaurants in the neighborhood.  Fresh and reasonably priced, this dainty spot offers traditional fair and a ~$40-50 omakase (which I'll try next time).
