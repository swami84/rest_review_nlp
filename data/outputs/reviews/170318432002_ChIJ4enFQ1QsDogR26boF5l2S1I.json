But don't let the empty lot fool you. It's very nice inside. We usually find 3-4 couples dinning and occasionally large groups. I like dinning inside with my hubby. It's dark, Candle light, and comfortable. But when we have the kids we like the outside patio.  It would be nice if they added a kids menu.  Staff is very friendly.  Drinks are delicious.

A small place but the ambiance is kind of romantic.  The margarita's were great and the food was absolutely amazing.  Though there was only one waitress, she was great, very attentive to everyone and very pleasant.  The service, food and drinks were amazing.  I loved the place so  much that I cancelled my birthday reservations the following week at one of my favorite River North restaurants and brought my group of 12 ladies there instead.  I had reservations at 7, called to say we would arrive at 7:20, which we did.  We ordered drinks, guacamole and plenty of food.  We ordered a second and third round of drinks in hopes of soon receiving our entrees.  After an hour one person received a salad and another a bowl of soup.  At 9:15 I asked if they thought we would receive our entrees within 10 minutes because we had paid for reservations at another venue at 10:00.  I was told that we would.  By 9:30 we asked again and was told they needed another 20-30 minutes. That of course did not make me happy as we were 2 hours in and still could not get our meals for another 30 minutes.  I was very disappointed as I was eager for my friends, who are very picky eaters, who turned their noses up at the location, and was not impressed with the reviews, to try this place. They stepped outside of their box to try a place which I had given a great review, to be highly disappointed with the slowness of the service, as was I.  Though I was very disappointed that may st. cafe' spoiled my birthday dinner with friends, I will definitely return on a day when I have 3-4 hours to sit in a restaurant because the food is great.",

Just three friends out for dinner on a Tuesday.  To start, the location is very deceiving, as it sits across from a large industrial park/power complex.  Outside it looks like a place plant workers would frequent for lunch or dinner.  Not a bad sign, necessarily, since the food then has to be pretty good for them to stay in business.  Inside, the place is tiny -- only about 8-10 tables, though there is a patio -- and clearly aiming for an intimate mood.  But the decor is dated.  Our server was super friendly, charming, and attentive at the table.  She even facilitated having a special cocktail made by the bartender --- one that was not on the  menu.  (BTW, don't miss the margarita and the coconut mojito.  Both excellent.)  However, the kitchen was rather slow.  When we dine we prefer to order in stages so as not to be rushed.  But when we return here, we will order all at once as the wait between courses was long enough to be noticeable and a bit annoying.  We also waited long enough for our check to be dropped that we had to ask for it.  But once asked for, the transaction was lightening-quick.  The food was spectacular!  I'm forever on the hunt for a good mole, and Abuela Ines's is one of the best I've had in Chicago.  My partner is always on the hunt for a good carne asada which he said compared favorably to our usual haunts -- thick, juicy, perfectly cooked with lots of flavor and good seasoning.  Our friend had a kabob which she said was delicious -- a good balance of beef and veggies.  All servings -- including the guacamole (which is rare to find generously portioned) -- were enormous.  Enough to feed another two people had they decided to pull up a chair and not order for themselves.  Being Northsiders, Pilsen and May St. Cafe are a bit off the beaten track, but not on the other side of the world.  We'll definitely be going back.",
