They have outdoor seating when the weather is nice and you enter in front of a staircase so maybe there is additional seating upstairs. I loved my food and the prices are fairly comparable for Capitol Hill.  The service was friendly and I received my sushi fairly quickly. No complaints really and I'd come back here again. I doubt I'd find any parking, but it's a nice hidden gem on a small backstreet...probably most known to people who work in this area.",

I ordered the Eel Lover's combo, which was also fantastic. I also ordered some tuna and salmon sashimi, and the salmon was some of the best I've ever had. Even their miso soup was memorable; being the first thing we tasted we were both impressed right from the start! It is a very small location - when we arrived we had to sit at their bar (which only seats 3!) We liked it so much that we went back a second time (and the food/service was just as good - this will be a \"must eat it\" for every future trip to DC for us!!)",

We were their only customers, but they made us feel welcome. We had a sashimi appetizer, some edamame and a couple of Saporos. We were so happy. Then came the hand rolls and sushi rolls. They were perfect, beautiful and very tasty. Thank you Momoyama for making a potentially sad food evening a happy one.",
