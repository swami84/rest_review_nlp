Love the greatest hits \u2013 battered chicken swimming in sauce (sesame, General Tso\u2019s, orange), pork fried rice and lo mein are deceptively simple and delicious, piping hot egg rolls, and the soups are always good. Generous portions. Run by an incredibly friendly family. Fast service \u2013 I usually call ahead by 10 minutes and my order is ready by the time I walk over. Recommended as your neighborhood Chinese comfort food restaurant.",

Yelled for me to \"come down!!\" And when I got downstairs he wasn't even there.  The food was cold and coagulated.  Sesame noodle appetizer was straight gross.  Can't eat it, guess I gotta throw away the whole dish.  The Rangoon and orange chicken is okay, what I'd expect from basic Chinese takeout, but it was cold and the texture really suffered.  I order Chinese takeout like once a year to satisfy the craving - anyone with a recommendation for good Chinese food in Brooklyn please reply!",

Even in the winter time when I order the food is always piping-hot! Yesterday I placed a huge order and they gave us 3 extra Shrimp Rolls and 2 extra Fantail Shrimps!",
