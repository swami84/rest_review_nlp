He remembers the same details to the orders of his customers. The service that was provided was outstanding and the food,  WOW, it was truly amazing. There isn't one complaint that could be said about the food at this restaurant.  It is truly amazing and very authentic. To drive 35 miles to come to this restaurant speaks volumes. If you haven't tried this restaurant,  you can't imagine what you're missing. I will make it a point to visit this restaurant at least once a month if not more. The food has truly made a lasting impression on me.",

Edited to say that we had the eggplant parmesan and shrimp alfredo. I am not exaggerating when I say there was no seasoning. None. The marinara and alfredo were very dissatisfying. Plus, it looked like my eggplant was battered then fried, which is unusual. It should be breaded... and seasoned!! Honestly, these are two very simple dishes.

They charged each of the four of us a $20 cover INCLUDING the person who was singing.  There was an audience of 8, including our table.  The group was amateur, and didn't merit a cover charge of any kind.  I am a professional musician and have no issues supporting young musicians, but these were teens, not well-known performers.  The menus were not clean, and the food was average at best.  The service was slow despite the small number of diners, and our plates were not cleared, nor our water refilled.  We had to ask the floor manager for both of these things to be done.  After all was said and done, I would have spent the same amount of money on U Street at a club with a headliner and much better cuisine.  This restaurant is scamming customers with their advertisements of jazz nights, and ripping off customers every week.  If you find yourself in the neighborhood go next door or across the street, where you will get value for your money.",
