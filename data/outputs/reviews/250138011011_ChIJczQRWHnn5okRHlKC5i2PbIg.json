The metered parking til 6pm then not necessary to feed meter on the street, but there is a parking lot that can be utilized for a small charge. The restaurant store front sets it apart from the other establishments as it catches your eye. It's a small trendy place, and has a bar area and table seating. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The ramen was good. I would like to see a spicy option in their selection. We ordered the pork ramen. The pork was very good! We also order 2 sushi rolls,  and found the to be very well made and of good quality!! I believe that BARkaya is a good fit for this area, and that more people will discover that as more people are drawn to the area with all the renovations being done in downtown Springfield!!!",

Way too much rice and not enough filling. My shrimp tempura roll wasnt even crispy, it was so mushy it was like it was refrigerated. Not sure if it was just an off day or just the chef.. but these rolls are VERY over priced for the quality I got, there are plenty of places around that are literally half the price and serve consistently great quality sushi.  And now on to the bathrooms, there was literally water leaking all over the floor from both restrooms into the restaurant , and  they were filthy. Someone was there I guess trying to fix them but didnt seem to have any success. I used the men's room and the toilet was cracked on the base and was leaking and the sink leaked everywhere as it drained.",

Since we were being ignored for so long we decided to leave. Out of curiosity I called from outside the door to see if they would ignore the phone. They picked up right away and  told me they didn't see us standing there. Come on the place isn't that big. Very rude workers will not be going back.",

It's got a sleek look to it with a bar that runs the majority of the restaurant, showcasing the sushi chef at the front and the head chef at the back. It is well lit but still dim enough to make for an intimate setting.  We arrived 5 minutes before opening but were still warmly greeted and seated by one of the servers. She had an excellent attitude and maintained a respectable level of professionalism while still having fun with us!  The food was incredible! We started off with some type of scallion stuffed beef skewers... yum! The sauce was fantastic. I wished it was a little thicker so it could stick to the beef like a glazee but it was still amazing.  Our main course consisted of the Hamachi Hama (specialty roll), the Dragon Kaya (signature roll), tuna roll, tuna nigiri and yellowtail nigiri.  I have to start off by saying, the quality of their fish was exceptional. My wife and I are huge sushi fans and this stuck out significantly to us. The rolls were beautifully designed but their aesthetics were second to their amazing flavor profiles! The one thing I was put off by is the amount of roe they used in preparation. I'm not a fan to begin with so I may be biased here but i also genuinely believe they used too much.  Overall, I would recommend Bar Kaya!",

Not a great place to stop if you're hungry and want a decent portion / value. Also not great if you want a good deal on a drink. Looked clean, ingredients were fresh, which is better than a few other places. Wouldn't go again, it's nothing special. The volcano roll was mushy and $20. Their regular rolls were thickly rolled. Edamame was fresh.  All and all, wouldn't recommend to anyone and I expect the place to be out of business within 3 years.  Everyone had a smile. The staff seemed to be trying. Bar management was irresponsible, and new people seemed to be needing to figure it out on their own.  It was clean. They get the 2 star for being clean. Im not worried that I got poisoned, which is better than most sushi in the area.  I think y'all have room to improve. Good luck.",

First of all, the space is excellent, nice decor and a very comfortable space. 3 of us came to enjoy Sushi, and we did not take them up on the Omakase, preferring to order a la carte. They have a good selection of drinks, we were interested in beer and Sak\u00e9. We had a local beer on draft which was great. The Sak\u00e9 only came in little cans, but was good.  We ordered Spicy Edamame, and the amount was pitifully small, and not at all spicy. We asked for a second order and were told they were out of Edamame- not sure how you can run out of Edamame on a Friday night. They offered fried Shishito Peppers as an alternate, which were good, but too large and slightly undercooked. We ordered a lot of different Sushi, Sashimi and rolls. Our server came back and told us that they were out of a couple of items, so we ordered some alternates. It took forever to get our food, and it came out in bits and spurts. And while we each ordered some of the same orders as each other, she only brought out one order for all of us. Also, even though the original menu we read online said the were 2 Nigiri per order, this is no longer the case- be aware that it is one piece of Nigiri/Sashimi per order- it gets very expensive quick!  We started realizing that many of the items were not showing up, and we were told they had run out of them, again, surprising on a Friday night. They even ran out of the Sak\u00e9 we were drinking. No Ikura, no Otoro or Chu Toro, Hokkigai, Tako, Amaebi...  Okay, so the Sushi itself was good, albeit expensive, the 3 of us paid $350.00 pretip for what we ate and drank. We figured 9 pieces of basic Nigiri Sushi cost $41.00 (see photo).  I am willing to give them a second chance, maybe I'll try the Omakase next time...",

There are not enough adjectives to describe how incredible the experience was as a whole.  From the moment you walk through the door the entire staff makes you feel like family.  The attention they paid to you to ensure you had an amazing experience was equally matched by the flavors they presented.  The 13 course Omakase Experience was simply brilliant and each course was prepared so delicately in front of your eyes.  Everything was fresh and plated with such a thoughtfulness from pairings on each course to the vibrant colors on each plate.  This is one restaurant you will want to visit as soon as possible.  Make sure to make a reservation for the Omakase Tasting Menu.   The final course in the tasting is hands down the greatest single bite of food I have ever had.",

The metered parking til 6pm then not necessary to feed meter on the street, but there is a parking lot that can be utilized for a small charge. The restaurant store front sets it apart from the other establishments as it catches your eye. It's a small trendy place, and has a bar area and table seating. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The ramen was good. I would like to see a spicy option in their selection. We ordered the pork ramen. The pork was very good! We also order 2 sushi rolls,  and found the to be very well made and of good quality!! I believe that BARkaya is a good fit for this area, and that more people will discover that as more people are drawn to the area with all the renovations being done in downtown Springfield!!!",

The restuarant itself is meticulously designed, modern elements that blend seamlessly with respect to the area's historic roots.  We did the 13 course Omakase which gave us a wide array of some of the best sushi and sashimi I've ever had in my life, prepared right in front of us by Chef Chow.  A few courses were non-traditional, but were fantastic non-the-less (standing out was the slightly seared waygu beef sashimi topped with shaved truffles).  Absolutely phenomenal food, hands down.  The service was fantastic as well, every need was met.  Our waitress was awesome and the front end manager, knowing I had a soft spot for Japanese whiskey, brought some samples for me to try.  Speaking of the drinks, they are out of this world.  Each cocktail has some form of Japanese flavors are incorporated and are as delicate and thought out as the food itself, used as an enhancement to the cuisine, rather than a stand alone.  That's not to say that you shouldn't go for just the drinks, because you definitely should.  Overall, our diner at BARkaya was one of the best dining experiences in the city, maybe the region.  We will be back for the normal diner service, and try to conjure a special occasion to try to 22 course Omakase next.  We're been excited and impressed with the renaissance of our city, and BARkaya is a terrific addition to it.",
