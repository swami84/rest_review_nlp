I consider myself a bit of an expert on authentic Italian food and a self-proclaimed foodie with high expectations when it comes to restaurants boasting authentic Italian. I am here to say that Regional Restaurant and Wine Bar in the Upper West Side of Manhattan is by far the best Italian food I have had since I left Italy. Every meal is prepared with the utmost authenticity and perfection. The service is impeccable and the atmosphere is just as if you were in Italy, with the owner visiting each table and personally ensuring that you are receiving the best service and meal possible. The chef is nothing short of an artist and his pairings of flavors and marriage of items in the daily specials are simply masterful. select any salad or pasta dish and you are sure to not only be pleased but have your expectations exceeded. The Branzino with couscous and clams flavored with lemon Capers and wine and served with the bed of fried leeks as light as air is one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life. Every item on the menu is perfect. The prefix menu at a low price of $25 offers you an appetizer generous entree and dessert all prepared with the greatest authenticity of true Italian cooking. They offer a great selection of Wines and Liquors and the owner is quick to recommend the perfect pairing for your meal. Weather permitting outdoor dining is also available to give you that Al Fresco Italian feel. Regional Restaurant and Wine Bar on Broadway and 98th may not get the notoriety of other Italian restaurants in the area but I have tried them all and I am here to tell you that this one is the only one that I have found that exceeds my expectations each and every time. I have been there 3 times in the last week and have been delighted on each visit. consistency, continuity and reliability are important to me and I know that I will always get a perfect meal at Regional. All of the desserts are fantastic but the real Hidden Gem is the hand-made semifreddo and I guarantee you will not find this anywhere else! They offer a fantastic deal on weekend brunch and overall the prices are on par if not less than many of the competition. I will also say that the portions are generous and you always get the best bang for your buck. If you haven't visited this restaurant and you like Italian food that is not only authentic but served in an authentic Italian atmosphere, then I encourage you to visit Regional Restaurant and Wine Bar in the Upper West Side. This is one of the Hidden gems of uws Manhattan.",

The service is above average, but I get the feeling that they get overwhelmed easily, so you may need to flag your waiter down once or twice, and the food may take a few minutes longer than you'd hope.  All in all though, this is a HIGHLY recommended place.  Oh, and the lady who I think is the manager there is a character. Very take it or leave it!",

Service was spotty when we arrived and the place was almost empty at that point. As more parties arrived the service became crazy. We had to wait over 45 minutes for our food and when it arrived some dishes were some cold, others not even cooked through. Whilst eating we had a plate cleared (by the manager) from in front of one of us whilst in the middle of eating. It was then very difficult to get anyone's attention to ask for this to be corrected. We were then asked to hurry up as the were other bookings that need to be seated. We were pushed out within 15 minutes of receiving our food. Busy occasion or not, the service was terrible and points to poor management. The food was also sub-par. I won't be returning and would not recommend.",

It looked like to me that there was a lack of staff, and the ones that were there were not tasks correctly. There was about 12 people waiting to be seated, with many many open tables insides. For some reason, the hostess, was also the busboy, cleaning and setting the tables, resulting in the long wait for dinner.

They were unique sausages that I suppose are relatively hard to come by, but they just didn't taste very good at the end of the day. We also ordered a burger with fries, and instead of fries, we got lettuce with NO dressing. So if we theoretically ordered salad, it still would have been a messed up order. Then when we got the fries, they were cold and tasted like sand.  Overall, it's hard to recommend this place.",

Today, however, is a different story. First the manager chastised us for being on our phones instead of eating.. which I shrugged off as her being a saucy NY'er. Then my sister's eggs (which she ordered over medium) were overcooked on one side and RAW on the other side. When the manager came over to see what was wrong, my sister let her know that the eggs were not cooked properly and it was just to let her know so she could tell the kitchen staff. At first the manager sort of apologized and asked if my sister wanted a replacement, to which my sis calmly turned down. The manager, however, got super rude again and told my sister that \"from now on when people come in and order eggs, that I'm going to tell them not to be so particular and specific about how they want them cooked\" My sister mentioned that, if they offer eggs cooked in different styles, they should be able to make them the way they're ordered. Then the  manager walked away and came back and wouldn't leave my sister alone. Then when i tried to calm the situation down, the manager came over to me and with a nasty attitude said \"oh its ok don't worry about it my mother is the same way\". She ruined my sisters birthday brunch and acted as if we the customers were asking for too much, she wouldnt drop it or apologize appropriately. NONE of us are ever coming here again and all of my friends neither.",

The food is reasonably good -- not amazing, but better than average -- so this seemed like a bulletproof way to avoid poor service... whoops.  Once, an actual waiter appeared at my door with my order. This struck me as unusual, but not inherently wrong. I live only a block away. Later, a delivery guy couldn't figure out how to open the door when buzzed in. Again, strange, not necessarily wrong... just strange. Then, last week, on a Friday night, after waiting over an hour for an order, I called over and was told my order had just left. Fifteen minutes later (again, I live only a block away) I decided to put on my shoes and a jacket and just walk over to the restaurant.  The restaurant was half-full. The bartender seemed also to be doubling as the manager -- and he was completely overwhelmed. The staff seemed to recognize this and was going out of its way to present all sorts of problems to him and make the situation worse. At one point a waiter actually handed him with a plate of food that the had been incorrectly prepared and made him bring it back to the kitchen despite his dealing with any number of other things at the moment, including me. Again, the place wasn't even half-full. It was clearly a punitive act. I can't say whether it was deserved, but it was obnoxious and childish and remarkably unprofessional.  My order then appeared out of the kitchen. One one hand, I was pleased -- at least the food would be hot -- but on the other hand, of course, I realized that this was probably the last straw for me. The bartender/manager acknowledged that I had actually come to pick up a delivery order, he was clearly the person who I had spoken to on the phone, who had clearly lied to me about my order, and he acknowledged none of this. I then waited five minutes for him to find a bag to put my food in.  I hope the chef fires the front of the house and opens another restaurant. The food is good. The service, however, is so poor as to be comical, if it weren't so offensively -- and I'm willing to say deliberately -- awful.",
