Price was decent too. My issue was the food. They say Cajun but it looks like all they did was sprinkle Cajun powder on it an bam called it that. The food could have been better. The crab was black which I\u2019m pretty sure crab is white. An what ever meat was on my breakfast had to have been frozen prior.

        "caption": "I have been trying to get back to this place for 4 years and I finally did!!! I had a blackened shrimp caesar salad 4 years ago that had so much shrimp I could barely see the salad.  It was seriously one of the most delicious meals I had in New Orleans and could not stop thinking about it.  I actually had to delay my departure to eat there this time because they are only open Thursday-Sunday but it was so worth it!!!! I called ahead, yes, crazy I know, but I had to be certain I could get this salad again.  They did not disappoint!!!  They went above and beyond for me and I especially have to thank Darrin and Mickey.  First of all the location is killer and this day they had the doors all open street side which feels very much like a European cafe.  The blackened shrimp caesar salad was sensational with more shrimp than I could count, perfectly dressed, with large homemade garlic croutons.  I was in heaven!!!  And since it was literally my last time before leaving New Orleans, I had to try the key lime pie, which was delicious and surprising.  It tasted almost like an ice cream cheesecake, refreshing and cold. So yummy!!!  Without a doubt, there is much great food in New Orleans, but this charming little cafe is truly a hidden gem and shouldn't be missed!",

Luckily with it a worthy establishment and worthy of the crowd it attracts.  For dinner I had the Cajun Combination. I knew it would be my only stop here so took the opportunity to try a little variety as you might think to. Here\u2019s what I found. The gumbo was very good, worthy of a whole bowl. The jambalaya was good but nothing too special. It was more rice than meat but it paired well with the other mound on the plate, the crawfish etouffee. I found the etouffee to be quite tasty and to have a decent amount of meat. The sauce itself was very nice. It also came with crawfish pie which are like samosas but with a crawfish mix inside the dough. I found the dough to be a bit overwhelming and thick. It was doughy and was off balance to the mixture inside. It could gave been a bid night for the dough but as they were I would not recommend them, and so probably not the combination either.  This is a bustling restaurant the atmosphere is fun in its own way and you may have to wait. They do seem to have a system to move people through but I never felt rushed. I would not hesitate to go back here again, but, as I said, I would not get the combination. Something  like the Gumbo and a full entree comes to mind.",

Our waiter, although not rude, was not very hospitable. Gave us menus without saying anything then returned ten minutes later to ask what we wanted. He never took a drink order which we had to request when we ordered the plate of red beans. The entrees  did come out fairly fast. The red beans were flavored with too much thyme which pretty much over powered any other flavor the dish had. Being a Lafayette resident I have eaten many a plate of red beans and unfortunately this was probably the worse red beans dish I ever had.",

I got the crawfish Caesar salad, and my husband gor a burger. I also got the Mardi Gras Hurricane. We were both quite pleased with the quality of the food & drinks. The place shined even brighter because of the server. I\u2019m sad to have not gotten his name, but he was the only server in the place and blew us away with his attentiveness and courteousness. Even after we paid for our meal, he offered to refill our waters so that we could remain at our table to relax and enjoy ourselves. My husband and I couldn\u2019t stop talking about how much we appreciated his amazing service. If you want a reasonably priced place with good food, great atmosphere, and excellent service, we recommend Cafe Pontalba!",

This is a great place for people watching. We went in at 12:30 p.m. one afternoon, drawn in by the breakfast sign outside, only to find that they stop serving breakfast at noon (wish they had taken in their sign). Our server, nice enough without being especially friendly, was patient with our mistake when we needed more time to look at the lunch menu. We had the Cajun Combination and the Creole Combination and found them to be typical Louisiana fare but nothing particularly special. We were there on a rainy, spring afternoon and found the inside of Caf\u00e9 Pontalba to be surprisingly dark. No additional lighting was turned on while we were there to combat the gloominess of the weather. The view of Caf\u00e9 Pontalba from the outside gives an impression of a lively place for a good meal right on Jackson Square. No real complaints here, however, I found this to be a very mediocre lunch experience as compared to what I expected.",

And that would be fair enough if the place was not half empty. And it has to be said that most other places were pretty full. Unsurprised. But maybe Must be bad day because a bit later a smile and a top of coffee and a lunch menu. Let's see how this goes. UPDATE.

The place was pretty busy but we were seated right away and our drink order was taken.  Our entire table ordered po-boys from here with a side of Cajun potatoes.  The wait for the food was not to long considering how busy the restaurant was.  The po-boys were typical po-boys: not too great but also not too bad.  The potatoes however were very tasty. I would not come here again for a po-boy and you are probably better off trying some place else for that. Perhaps the rest of their menu is better.  In short, the service was great but the food was nothing exceptional.",

I was trying to decide if I wanted to get the bbq shrimp or the fried shrimp.  Boyfriend suggested that I ask for a taste of the bbq sauce.  He's so smart.  I did and it was good, average sauce, so I decided on the bbq shrimp.  Then the waitress told me they didn't use the bbq sauce on the bbq shrimp.  Silly me.  She went on to describe what they did use.  It didn't sound appetizing, so I got the fried shrimp.  It was pretty good.  The breading was buttery and crisp.  The shrimp was fresh.  But it was nothing special.  The fries were awful.  A little undercooked and tasteless.  Boyfriend said his Cajun Combo was \"good.\"  It was all fine, but one doesn't come to N'arlins for fine. The service was slow, despite the lack of customers.  Everything took a little longer than it should have, from being seated to getting our water to getting a sample of the bbq sauce that was not on the bbq shrimp to getting the bill. And there's no air conditioning.  Which is partly on me.  Who visits Louisiana in August? There was nothing horrible.  But one goes to the French Quarter for amazing food and this wasn't it.",

My daughter's food came to the table cold as well.  My daughter is a server so she didn't complain much.... but we left after paying an almost  $50 bill.  Went to Daisy Dukes and had a yummy meal for $20. Never go again!!!!",

We were hungry and close by so we decided to grab a couple burgers. Fries are $2 extra for a small handful of bland, soggy, cold fries. We waited 15 minutes to sit which wasn't bad but another 10-15 for a waiter to even stop by and speak to us. We were about to leave but he unfortunately got to us right before we did. The burgers tasted like cheap frozen patties though they cost a hell of a lot more than that. , I couldn't finish it. The waiter never came by and we never got any more water. Still come here for drinks sure but don't count on the food. Even being busy is no excuse for poor quality.",
