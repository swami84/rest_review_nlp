But everyone here is tremendously warm and friendly. I usually get bread and pastry and have recommended everyone to come here. Had a small birthday party for my friend so I Ordered a 12 inch pineapple and butter cream filling cake.... And finally, I know I don't have to go hunting for the perfect cake anymore! Taste was supreme,moist and well crafted! I wanted it plain because we had cake toppers and candles but she can definitely add whatever you want. This is my cake shop. Already, 4 persons from the party are asking  where I got the cake. It was really that good. Price was only $50. Highly recommend!",

As a pescatarian it's already a challenging finding good quality food at a decent price so it would help to have signs up of what you run out of just to help people be ready for you when they come order. So five stars for taste and presentation . Four stars for not enough options or not enough staff to produce what you are saying you have. I will try again when I am in that area though.",
