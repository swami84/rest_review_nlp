I order the poke tuna taco as a bowl and it's delicious! Great fresh ingredients with spice and a great amount of tuna. I love flexibility to make any taco into a bowl. The new shop is tight but service was quick and efficient. They are also cashless! In addition of the tacos they have different cuts of beef available for purchase. I definitely recommend you try these out!",
