The satay beef with wide noodle was good too but I like the curry more. I'm coming back to order the Portuguese Bake rice dish next time. Must order 15 minutes ahead of time. Can't wait!!! I'm feeling hungry again...",

        "caption": "The Legend Cafe House might seem familiar to people that have been frequently eating around 86th Street in the Bensonhurst area a few years ago. It used to be around that area but the location changed to a Asian Steak house over time. Now, years later, it reopened at this new spot slightly off the beaten path of the hustle and bustle of the busier 86th street area and is instead located just across from Jmart.  The new place as before specializes in Hong Kong cafe style food and have a decent variety of selection to choose from on their menu.  The baked dishes like Baked Chicken over white sauce which is a rice dish with a melted cheesy topping have always been one of my go to.  They also have sizzling steaks on a hot plate here but I didn't try that out yet.  During this review, it was their second or third day of business and thus as with a lot of places with grand openings, there growing pains. When I went, an order to go took almost 40 to 50 minutes despite it being moderately busy. Partly it as because the baked dishes usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes to make but that still doesn't explain the other 20 to 30 minutes. I expect this to improve over time when the business gets into its groove and work out the kinks so I'm not holding that against them for now.  There is a decent amount of tables inside as of now and because of covid, they currently also have outdoor dining.",
