We were welcomed by Queen, who, even though she was wearing a mask, I could tell, was smiling. Daniel waited on us and was so kind and engaging.  Haley, the chef, came out to speak to us. We were glad we could could compliment her in person on the meal.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  Our next visit from Georgia will definitely include a trip back to The Black Jockey . . .",

Then waited a few more minutes before she stopped at our table so we could place a drink order. We told the server we wanted to order food also. 10 minutes later, still no drinks or menus, the server said our drinks would be right up. After another 5 minutes of waiting, we got up and left. We wasted over 20 minutes here for nothing. I could tell that other people were getting really annoyed as well. It was early, so it wasn't that busy, but there was only one server and a bartender, both of whom had no sense of urgency. I've never seen a bartender move that slow.

The guy working there looked him up and down then said, \"But he can come in\". How rude and discriminatory is that? Very! It was apparent that he had interest in the gentleman, therefore letting him in, but denying us because we are females. Tacky and we will never spend one cent there. We probably should not have even considered the place after our friends already had such a terrible experience there earlier in the night. Out of convenience we attempted and did not succeed. We walked away saving money and laughing at the joke of a worker we were presented with.",

There were 5 of us and no one was impressed with anything they ate. The food, honestly, wasn't memorable and there wasn't much of a selection. A sandwich, a green salad, chicken salad, no steak or real entree like what you imagine if you were really going to dinner. Average or below. My bacon burger was just a standard burger, very eh, and over cooked, but how can you not overcook a 1/3\" thick patty? My daughter had wings, nothing special, and slightly rubbery. I left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. If it were a quick lunch spot it would be fine I guess, but for dinner? Nope. It's a shame because they could do a lot with such a nice space. In the meantime, Qdoba is down the street.",

We told our waitress after she took our drink order and took a little longer than usual to get them to the table that we were going to a show and we were hoping to get through dinner a little faster than normal to which she huffed and took our order. Twenty five minutes later we asked another worker, I\u2019m assuming he was a manager, if we would get the salad before the dinner came. He walked around the corner and immediately came walking back with the salad. Clearly it had been ready and just sitting. Approximately 45 minutes later our food came. My dish (risotto) was inedible. My husband even tried it and said how awful it tasted. He ate his (pork and risotto) but later confessed it almost made him gag while eating it. I tried it and thought it wasn\u2019t much better than mine and the pork was clearly not cooked right. Not one time did our waitress check on us or ask if everything was ok. When we had our second round of drinks while waiting for something to come to the table it was only because my husband called for her as she walked by. Terrible experience!",
