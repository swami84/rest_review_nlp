Definitely glad we did! Jerry our server was spot on with his recommendations, Bill the owner came over and chatted us up for a little before our appetizer came out - super friendly fella!  We had a reservation for 6pm and the restaurant was about half full when we got there (Friday evening) but by 7 it was at capacity and they were fully booked for the night. Great atmosphere, I love the fact that they have the lights a little brighter and the music loud enough to hear but not overpowering rather than a dark, dimly right restaurant like you find all over RN.  We had the Torchio pasta, the bolognese and the shrimp scampi appetizer - all delicious!  Bill you should have retired and opened this place sooner! Will definitely be back. - nick and Allie",

With so many choices of restaurants in the city I encourage you to check this place out.  We came for lunch and ate in the outside patio, although the inside was lovely too- we just had a rare sunny day for this season! Everything was incredibly fresh.  We ordered the arugula salad which was perfect. We also ordered the gnocchi which was devine, an unbelievable whipped ricotta/honey/cracked pepper spread with tomato fig jam, and the grilled asparagus.  For desert we had the best vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso.  An absolutely delightful lunch!  The staff was attentive without being intrusive and we had the pleasure of talking with the owner who really puts his heart and soul into the food. This is definitely a place a will return to next time I'm in Chicago- I felt so fortunate to have found such a high quality meal just by luck!  I wish the proprietor all the best in his endeavors! Five stars, for sure!",
