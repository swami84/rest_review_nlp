I understand that there was a reservation needed however,  In my rush I was hoping someone would try something to see what they could do. no one tried to see if they could make any accommodations at the bar or if anyone may be leaving. I immediately left and went next door to McCormick and schmick's Who also had a reservation policy but were willing to see what they could do so we could be seated to have something to eat. I am now enjoying my prime steak  And lobster combination. Thanks a lot Ruth Chris for not being accomodating",

I did not care for the mint jelly, but I am kind of biased when it comes to accessory sauces because I feel that your meat should stand alone if it is quality and it did not disappoint.

We were seated promptly upon our arrival. But once we were seated that's where the problems started. Our initial server did not come up to introduce himself for at least 5-10 mins but before he came up another server \" Josh \" noticed that we had been siting for along time without having water on the table or bread. We thought that this guy was going to be on top of service but that wasn't the case at all.  After taking our drink order and asking for bread again Josh went over the menu and explained that there was a limited menu for Valentine's Day weekend. We placed our dinner order  and ordered a appetizer as well. While we were waiting for bread still the appetizer came out first followed shortly by bread which had a few small pieces in the serving. We asked for a second portion of bread but it never came.  Our meals finally came out and the portions were great. Which is the only reason why this got any stars.  My only issue with the actual dinner part was that my filet was under cooked. I didn't mention it because at this point I was over dealing with this server who never showed up. After we had stopped eating and were waiting for a server which was about 30 mins a manager came over and asked how we were doing. We explained that we just wanted the bill and boxes and wanted to leave. The manager apologized and insisted on buying us desert. He came back with menus and gave us a gift certificate that was for $25.00  but only good until March 2020.  After we had told the manager what deserts we wanted our server who had been missing came over to \" check on us\" and see if we wanted dessert. \u200d\u200d\u200d\u200d. We told him that the manager had already handled that. Our deserts were great! But again we waited and waited for someone to bring us the bill which turned out to be another 15 mins. We looked over the bill once it finally arrived from our server and our card in to pay that took another 10 mins for him to grab it.  We sat there waiting for him to bring the bill back. But it took me getting up to go speak to a manager for him to finally reappear with our check. We paid promptly and on the way out I handed back the $25 gift certificate to the manager that gave it to us.  We will not be returning to this place for a second chance. For the price of the food you expect better service. I understand that it was Valentines weekend but this server was more attentive to a larger group and possibly other tables in other rooms. If that's the case he should not have been taking other tables. While were were getting ready to leave the table next to us seemed to be disgusted with him as well.",

The host stand was all very well dressed and super kind as they were giving out roses. We checked in and then were seating within a few minutes by a young girl who was probably dressed better then me lol. We were immediately introduced by the server-although I forgot his name. He was spectacular from start to finish. We got our food in perfect time and in the perfect temperature. And finished it with a delicious cheesecake. Overall, I absolutely loved it here and me and my boyfriend will definitely be returning. Thanks ruth chris for an amazing date.",

        "caption": "Update 12/27/2019: My fiancee and I came back for another date night and wow! It was incredible. Some pepper for the caesar salad would have been good but I added it and delightful, the potatoes au gratin were a bit bland but my fiancee loved them lol. The real hero was the truly amazing and PERFECTLY cooked 6oz filet mignon I had with some shrimp and kale with ham. Oh! Also, the Tuna Tartare was incredible too. So flavorful and delicious. Upgraded from 3 stars to 5 (closer to 4.7) as the service was on point, food delicious, steaks perfectly cooked and just overall an entirely different experience that will definitely bring us back!!! Nicki Kern is the hero for bringing us back here and promising exactly what we got, a renewed experience with wonderful service and perfectly cooked food. Malika is the best waitress ever!!!  *update 9/16: A very wonderful manager named Nicki Kern called me and apologized and understood and heard me when she asked for arun down. I felt listened to and valued. I will be going back with my fiancee for a redo of a romantic meal in the very near future and she is mailing me information so that I can work with her to ensure the success. This is how you handle these things! Excellent follow up and I will update this review after we give it another shot :) so for now an update from 2 to 3 stars pending another try.  I've now been to some excellent steak houses, including Gordon Ramsay's Steak, and Ruth's Chris was mediocre at best. The service was just not on point. I made the reservation specifically for my fiancee's birthday asking for them to help it be a special dinner. Instead, we got slow enough service that if not there for his birthday, I would have left. We got water eventually, drinks took a while, bread eventually came out, then we asked for more and waited longer for bread than the appetizer we ordered 5 mins after requesting the bread. We eventually, about 10 to 15 minutes after our appetizer came out had to tell the waitress we were unhappy. By then, no bread, I was out of water and a drink just sitting there, and his drink was also almost empty. She's apologized and got us the water, the wrong order of bread (they have 2 types we asked for just the sourdough as we didn't like the other), and it again took significantly too long to get the drinks. On top of that, when the food came out my steak was so rare it may as well have been tartare when I ordered medium rare. They took the filet mignon I had cut up to check temp back to the kitchen, and not only did the kitchen just put that cut up filet mignon under their broiler, the manager brought that back to me and left it. I checked and of course the large chunk was still rare as could be and told the waitress. So my fiancee had to sit there feeling bad for enjoying his birthday meal while they mismanaged my food. Finally the manager apologized and brought a new steak, still under cooked but not as bad and so I just accepted it because their plates are so hot I just literally cooked the thing the rest of the way using the plate! The manager did comp the steak but for over $200 for a meal I cannot recommend this place or it's service, especially not the management to anyone. For those prices, go over to Gordon Ramsay's Steak at the Horseshoe Casino for the same area for excellent food, cooked to perfection, and with service to match it.",

They should have offered to remake the whole thing but instead, the manager took it back and reheated it, it then came back pink in the middle but quickly turned to well done. Even before I sent the steak back, it was extremely chewy and I let the manager know this but, it looked like he turned a deaf ear to it.  I ate one or two more bites when it came back and left it sit in the plate( this steak did not chew like any filet I've ever had). Waitress never said a word except are you done. Anyone could tell I was not happy but, nothing was said. This is by far the worst Ruth Chris we have ever been to. Some one from corporate needs to come in and do a quality control audit! I would like to be refunded for the filet. Only thing manager did was send two glasses of perseco but, I had already told the waitress I don't drink.",

Shocking for a specialty steak place. The manager came and said he would fix the issue. They RE-cooked the same steak that was already well done around the sides in order for it to get medium in the center. If you are a steak place, you should know you can\u2019t re-cook a steak anyway. It was so tough and yes, very well done. There was a small spot in the middle that was now medium. Yes. Very disappointing for a $180 meal supposed to be a special occasion. Needless to say, most of the steak stayed on the plate and when we received our bill, not so much as a dollar was deducted. They brought 2 glasses of champagne for us to toast when my husband said already that he didn\u2019t drink, as they kept asking if we wanted cocktails then wine, etc. odd they would bring champagne. So sad this meal.",

However, I will say that we have been somewhat underwhelmed with our last 4 visits. Thankfully, the food has remained consistent, but the service has lost its edge. Each of the last 4 visits has wound up withe a situation that required manager intervention.  While he has always made good on each situation, and it has been appreciated, at that pricepoint, he shouldn't need to be involved at all. I believe that unlike some of the other steak houses that recruit veteran and/or mature wait staff who have made careers of their position, it seems Ruth's Chris wait staff has a high churn rate and consists mainly of college students and/or waiters lacking in the art of creating a fine dining experience. I would hope management takes this review seriously and come up with a solution. Have had some wonderful memories during past visits and would hate to nix this establishment from future dining consideration, however folks will only tolerate bad experiences for so long. We visit Ruth's Chris Baltimore and Phili locations between 8-10 times per year. Just saying.",

I hated admitting it to my Virginia raised wife, but it really was that good. The crab cakes are good on their own, but order them with steak and make sure to soak the crab cakes in the steak juices a little. Their appetizers (we had the bbq shrimp) and their house made drinks are awesome too. The BBQ shrimp appetizer is in a New Orleans style and is really good. The sides are good too. We had the creamed spinach and steamed broccoli. The spinach was good, but I\u2019m not going to celebrate steamed broccoli. My wife and I came here for our anniversary and were extremely impressed. We had the chocolate molten cake for desert and it wasn\u2019t anything to write home about, but after that meal? Who cares? Their other desserts appears popular with other guest though. Also, I think their waiters have their PhDs in Steak. They were very knowledgeable and knew how to explain the differences in different steak types. It is expensive, but the steak, appetizer and crab cake were worth the extra price. I\u2019m usually disappointed by the price to taste ratio at these type of restaurants and I honestly wasn\u2019t. Also dress is only business casual.",

Our waitress Katie H was wonderful in the beginning but then she started to act like we were bothering her. She began to huff and puff and her body language spoke for itself. Two of our steaks were not cooked the way we ordered so she never said sorry or anything. Everytime one of us would say, \"Excuse me miss.\" She responded with, \"What?\" The icing on the cake was when she forgot a item for the table next to us and we witnessed her apologize over and over and even told them the item would be on her. That's when we decided to make a complaint with the manager. JD was very nice and understanding. He handled the situation and was very helpful. Overall the food was good.",

The place was not at all crowded and they tried to seat us in a closed dark corner with little view but I refused and requested a different table. Went there because the place was supposed to be a great steakhouse. Wrong! Wish I would have stayed home as I can cook a better steak on my back porch grill for a quarter of the price of what we spent there. Would not go back even if the food were free. Very disappointed! The place is stuffy so if you're the stuffed shirt type this place should suit you well. If you are looking for a seriously great fillet mignon try Jimmy's Seafood on Holabird Ave.. Better steak, service and price. My 2 cents.",

First of all they gave us a table for 7 in the middle of a pathway.  Servers going back and forth and my son was constantly having to move his chair to let them by.  Second, two of us ordered medium rare steak.  The steaks came out completely cooked, even burnt on the outside.  I kept mine, the other steak was sent back. And we had them take it off our bill.  Third, we ordered a dirty martini, it was disgusting.  Tasted like pure salt.  We had to send that back.  They brought another.  It was okay...just okay.  Fourth, had we known a bottle of wine was cheaper than ordering 4 glasses (the server should have told us when we ordered) we would have done that.  We didn't know until after I asked.  Fifth, those that had the turkey dinner received cold food.  Not sure what was going on, but for the price the food should have been at least warm.  Spent more than $600.00 and didn\u2019t even get a Happy Thanksgiving or Happy Birthday after I let the waitress know we were celebrating birthdays also. I'm not sure if it is new management or what, but I will not go back to Ruth Chris in Baltimore ever again.  This was my all time favorite place to frequent. Even though we have others that are closer to us.  We would go at least 4 times a year just because we like the Ruth Chris at Inner Harbor Pier 5.  They just lost my business for good!!!  Oh and I did receive a message from another review I wrote asking for the best way to contact me.  I haven\u2019t heard a word from anyone yet.",

Not only did they go through great lengths to acknowledge our anniversary and make us very welcome, they put rose petals on our table and gave us a semi private table. We dined for 3 hours and our server was amazing! Might make it a yearly thing!",

        "caption": "I'm not a huge steak fan so it could have been 1 of 3 things that made this visit that puzzled me.  Maybe it's because I'm not a huge steak fan, maybe it was this Ruth's Chris location, maybe it's Ruth's Chris in general?  I was super excited to visit Ruth's Chris for the first time ever and even promised myself steak although I haven't had steak since my elementary school football team won the city championship. That's a LONG time ago!  Well, the experience was certainly lackluster and I can say I will probably never go back to a Ruth's Chris.  The food was not overly delicious. I also felt crowded in a very dark restaurant. Maybe it was dark to set the mood for the evening? I don't know.  The waitress was not very attentive to our table.  On two occasions, we had to ask a waiter at another table for water refills. Also, another waiter had to get us replacement silverware and plates as ours was dirty. I see these types of issues in other, much less classy restaurants. I did not expect to experience this in Ruth's Chris.  Very disappointed.",
