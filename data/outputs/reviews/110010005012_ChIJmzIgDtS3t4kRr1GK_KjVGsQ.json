My kids, who had not been impressed with the food options near our hotel, gave the Woodley Cafe 5 stars each. They liked the food (cleaned their plates) as well as the interior of the cafe \u2014 clean, cozy, quiet \u2014 and even remarked positively about the service! It made a rainy day of sightseeing just a whole lot better. Definitely 5 stars!",

The salad with the entree was skimpy and the seafood pasta was good except the scallops weren't cooked all the way and were practically raw. The pecan pie was pretty good. Not sure I would return because I feel like I was tricked with their online prices being so much less than their menu in restaurant. If not for the sweet waitress, I would be rating a 2.",

When we got in the bar was almost empty so we got greeted right away. We asked the bartender about their happy hour specials on the sign outside, and he didn't know all the drinks on it, and they didn't have a drink list for HH. When we asked if one of their specialty drinks was good or popular he said \"Oh I don't know, I'm not really a big alcohol person.\" Ok, if you don't drink, at least know your menu. We ordered a frozen margarita and a pina coloda. Nothing crazy, and both were advertised HH specials. It took the bartender about 15 minutes to make the two drinks. At one point he asked a CUSTOMER at the bar \"Do you know how to salt a glass?\" Seriously? The owner walked over and the drinks were apparently incorrect so he remade them. He salted the rim, but then wiped the excess salt off around the entirety of the rim with his FINGER after he had just been outside potting flowers. So after about 20 minutes we finally got our drinks. They were terrible. The margarita tasted like dirty water. It was weak and tasted awful. The pina colada was made with a mix and tasted like coconut milk - no taste of pineapple or rum. We asked a woman next to us if her drink was any good (a margarita on the rocks served in the wrong glass) and she instantly responded, \"No, it was pretty bad.\" After the first couple sips, we didn't touch our drinks and after HALF AN HOUR of no one acknowledging us, we asked another server to close out our tab. He couldn't do it, and our bartender had left. He left the restaurant and no one else could help us. They had to call him on his cell phone. When he returned he was carrying a bouquet of flowers. When he finally came over to us it had been such an unpleasant experience that we told him our drinks were not great and asked if they could be comped (neither of us has ever sent back a drink before). and if we could order beers instead. \"We don't really do that here\" he said. And when we asked if it was possible he scolded us. \"You guys couldn't have asked me sooner?\" he chided, even though he didn't acknowledge us once after giving us our drinks. He did however end up eventually swapping our drinks for beers, which were definitely not ice cold.  This place really needs a bar rescue.",

They also have a nice outdoor area to dine.  The reason I will never go back to this place is due to the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. It wasn't just slow when they weren't busy, our server Daniel was down right hostile and rude. We should have said something to the manager but were too shocked. Not only was general service bad, he complained to our faces about a request to substitute fries on one of the dishes. When he didn't supply condiments I grabbed them myself which he then pulled out of my hands saying \"my manager is here I don't want him to see you getting things\". He practically tossed our plates onto the table, clearly not caring if we had the right dishes or if we needed anything. All our drinks ran out without an offer for a refill and it was a hassle to split the bill. Many of us have worked in the service industry and know what to expect in good service and where to make exceptions. This guy should not be allowed to work any job related to customer service and he is the sole reason this establishment will not see any more of our business.",

Anxious as to how the food was going to be as we were not impressed with the service the people sitting next to us received what looked like an extravagant splay and we sighed relief. Our food came out within a reasonable time frame and it was as easy on the eyes as on the stomach, delicious. Viewing interactions between other customers and their servers I could tell we had the short end. Aside from our particular waitress the experience was quite pleasurable, food was impressive, and priced very reasonably. I'd highly recommend!",
