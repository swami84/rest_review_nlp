The food came with individually packaged utensils and shredded Parmesan too. (Sorry if the pictures don't look the best but trust me they're better than they look!) I decided to order their Fettuccine Verdi (spinach pasta) with Cream of Mushroom sauce and I was in LOVE!! The sauce was super creamy and perfectly seasoned, came with lots of mushroom too which was great. Most importantly, their pasta was AMAZING. Some freshly made pasta never goes wrong. If you're worried that the \"spinach\" pasta would taste worse or different than normal pasta, it doesn't. It still tastes fresh and it was sooo good!  All in all, definitely go check it out! Don't think you can get such good and fresh pasta for such prices. My new fav!",

There is a large help yourself area where they have things to eat with your meat such as chimichurri, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, various salads, pickles, etc.  There were various guys walking around every few minutes with different meats to offer.  There were cards on the table for each guest which when flipped a certain way would allow the guys carrying the meat to stop by and ask if you'd like a slice.",
