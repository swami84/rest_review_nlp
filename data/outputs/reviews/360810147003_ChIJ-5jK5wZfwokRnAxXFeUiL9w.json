And that includes ALL chicken sandwiches. Chicken parm, hot chicken, classic fried chicken- if it is a sandwich that involves chicken, I promise that you will not find it better than how Comfortland prepares it. Scary good. Throw on some stretchy pants and make the trip for it.  If fried chicken isn\u2019t your thing, you\u2019re crazy, but no worries- they have other stuff too. Their burger is good enough to contend with any other, and their cochon po\u2019boy really nails the NOLA flavor profile excellently. Their breakfast sandwiches are so good that my girlfriend once FaceTimed me on a work trip just to talk about one. Yo really can\u2019t miss here.  I can\u2019t say enough good things about Comfortland. My only complaint is that they don\u2019t (regularly) make a mac and cheese- so PLEASE ADD THIS TO YOUR FIRE MENU. That would be next level. Anyway, go here and eat everything because it is all excellent.",

The staff is friendly both on the phone to place your order or to call it any questions about your order and upon arrival at said establishment.  The food is also very tasty and delicious.   It is definitely different than anything I've had before here in New York Queens. It is definitely southern food I had the spicy fried chicken sandwich which had pickles and mayonnaise and it was definitely spicy and very tasty.   Their fries are also very unique they have parmesan cheese and oregano and sea salt very tasty..  I would definitely recommend picking up an order of chop cheese empanadas with the spicy ketchup. The meat is seasoned with peppers and they are very delicious.  We had a Nutella shake which is also very good.  I would recommend to try this place out at least once.",

They make a lot of donuts and other pastries, and all the ones I've tried so far are fantastic. There's cookies, donuts, mini donuts, Oreo bread pudding, rainbow cake, king cake donuts- you name it. There is a distinct New Orleans theme to the place, and it feels authentically infused with the decor and food. Hot tip: definitely raid the wide and awesome array of hot sauces right next to the kitchen so you can really kick your food up a notch. Without a doubt my favorite place for breakfast and dessert in Queens, if not the universe.",

My only advice, have more in demand of vegan options for donuts. And in the future have more vegan options like pancakes, French toast, or a special new  house recipe. Give this place a try for vegan and non vegan options.",

It tasted so fresh that you thought you were eating the actual fruit from the fields as you picked it yourself. The donut wasn't too oily and was huge.

Our Barista today, Joe, went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, had everything we needed and felt welcomed.

        "caption": "Comfortland is a relatively new establishment that has a lot of potential. The staff is friendly and their decor is welcoming. Their food is eye-catching, doughnuts are creative, and flavors are on point. Unfortunately, they have a few kinks to work out before really making a push to challenge doughnut plant. I ordered three filled doughnuts, a breakfast sandwich, french toast, tater tots, and coffee. While the doughnuts tasted good, their dough to filling ratio was skewed too heavily in favor of the dough. It seemed like there was only a narrow strip of filling in each doughnut, which was slightly disappointing. The dough seemed a little too dense for my taste as well. Overall, I would call them solid utility doughnuts. The breakfast sandwich was good, though it seems like they run out of biscuits during rushes, leading to an additional 20 minute wait. Something to consider in case one is pressed for time. The interplay between the marinara, egg yolk, and biscuit made for a really enjoyable flavor and textural experience. I would say it was worth the wait.  Unfortunately they mixed up my French toast order and it was another 15 or so minute wait until they made me a new batch. They must have put my order behind other folks because I saw several orders of French toast come out before mine. The music was lovely and made for a relaxing atmosphere. I would prefer it to be a little quieter as the cooks call your name to pick up your sandwiches. In lieu of their yelling over the music or having people crowd around the waiting area (impeding access to the only garbage can and bathrooms) it may be easier to have it be a little quieter so folks can sit at their table and hear their names called. Comortland has a lot of promise and it seems like the staff is really dedicated to making the place successful which is critical for customer satisfaction. While I'm a local, I'll probably continue to head out a little further to doughnut plant if I'm hankering for doughnuts but I hope to come back in a month or two to see their progress.",
