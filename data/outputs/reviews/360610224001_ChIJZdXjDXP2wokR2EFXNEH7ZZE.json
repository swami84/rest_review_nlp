I paid the reservation fee of $25 for one of the huts. When I arrived there was a line, I went to one of the guys in the front and told him I had a reservation. He asked to see our ID\u2019s and sent us to the back to the line. He says he would have the manger come get us. We waited for about 20 minutes. Then a woman with dreads came out to seat people inside I guess. The woman was very nice, we told her we had a reservation and the guy sent us to the line. I could tell she was annoyed that the guy sent us to the line after telling him about the reservation. Once seated we were even more disappointed. Our waitress took our drink orders  and never came back to check on us. When we flagged her down to order food she told us they didn\u2019t have any left. She had a bad attitude the whole night specifically toward us. Not sure why.",

Our 1st drinks came out relatively quickly but our food took FOREVER!!! The group across from us was seated 20 mins after us and got there food within 10 mins of ordering. On top of me and my lady getting our food well after being seated it came out somewhat cool not HOT. My lady was very turned off by the service and the atomosphere which was warming and festive couldn't be enjoyed. If you looking for atmosphere then a great place to go but looking for anything else BEWARE!",

They started the 2 hr seating as soon as we sat down not after getting our food so of course once we ate and then got to the hookah our two hrs was up we explained to the security plus the waitresses that due to us eating our food can we at least finish our hookah all we got was \u201csorry but it\u2019s another party that was waiting\u201d and they starting cleaning up the glasses and plates while we was still sitting. Also a party was there before us it look like the manager knew them but they wasn\u2019t asked to leave and still was there after we packed up to leave. Not only did we purchase the birthday hookah with all flavors but we wasn\u2019t able to enjoy it. I felt it was a waste of money and if you need proof I have the bank statement with the charge to prove how much I spent. Didn\u2019t like the way we was treated.",

Paola was amazing and handled us with care to the best of her abilities seeing as she\u2019s the hostess. We waited in line for 2 hours about an hour in they were going to turn us away saying that they weren\u2019t taking anymore guest even though it was confirmed that we\u2019d be able to get seated. Fast forward to our seating, Paola took our orders due to ridiculous wait time and she wanted to help us speed up our night. We were NEVER greeted by our server. Paola came brought us water while we continued to wait. Our food was brought out and we weren\u2019t given napkins or anything. After having more than enough within this 2.5 hour time I decided to get a manager in which she told us the meals would be on the house due to what we endured. Only for us to never receive our second round of drinks to which we asked about it to be told the bar is now closed and continued to be rushed out for the rest of our time. We didn\u2019t even get to utilize the full 2 hour seat time due to negligence amongst staff minus our hostess. If it wasn\u2019t for the host great service this whole night would of been a disaster I expected a lot better.",

The DJ Neesh was able to identify when one party was feeling one genre and the other party was feeling the next. She was able to put mutual music, all genres to satisfy all the customers. The bartender Christian gave undivided attention to both his bar customers and his table customer. All waiters were on point, cleaning up behind everyone and ensuring everyone had their new and improved iPad menus. The hookah was amazing and they always changed our coals to make sure we had a great experience. I honestly will keep going but just know, this is the place you want to be.",

We got here about 7:45pm wasnt crowded  which was good... so we thought. we got seated, waitress came thru without a menu  and asked us what we wanted as if we been there before or  had menus.  Drinks came fairly fast.  I was trying to get the waitress  attention  for water, but everytime she passed she had her head down We finally  got her attention  to place a order for food and we waited 30 mins... and it seemed like our waitress disappeared  on us and we didnt receive our food. Our order was not placed!! Then to get the check, we had to flag down another waitress. (It seems like the waitresses walk with there heads down or pretend that they dont hear you saying \"Excuse me\" to avoid you purposely) HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND IT WASNT EVEN BUSY.  THEY AUTOMATICALLY GET 18% Gratuity TIP AND I TRULY FEEL SHE DIDNT DESERVES  IT. I would of rather  my tip to go to the  bartenders, they were more attentive. Yeaaaaa first impressions are everything and I was definitely not impressed- first and last time. Never again!  *UPDATE-- WOW! I'm applaud!! They are quick to lie! If that situation would have occurred I would have put it in my review. However, no manager tried to rectify the situation - no manager came over to us to apologize and WE WERENT COMPSENATED the 18% Gratuity you stated. I understand you have a business to run and you want to keep a certain appearance but lying isn't the way to go about it. It just makes You and your team look untrustworthy!!",

This happened when each 3 showed up.  After everyone showed up and we\u2019re having appetizer, she comes over and says \u201cyou guys can\u2019t put anymore tables together, no more people\u201d....we told them 5 to start with and we didn\u2019t put any tables together, these are the 2 tables you gave us to start with.  And the place is almost empty...see the photo.  Drinks never came that we asked for. Asked for the check and it never came. Eventually had to go to the bar to get the check, and was charged for drinks we never got.  We were just ready to leave so just paid it to get out of this torture chamber. Awful, disorganized, unprofessional place. Why is there no option to give less than 1 star...",

If you have a big party this is the way to go because people were waiting when we got there and we're waiting when we left. The food was great essoecially the sticky wings and the calamari. My wife loved it, she just wished it was a little bigger for a dance floor and had a live dj. I think some nights they have a DJ but not on this night but it was still an awesome place.

I was almost immediately turned off by having to stand in line for 20 minutes in the freezing cold only to walk in and see ample seating space. However the decor is very nice and inviting.  The hookahs here are very strong unlike other establishments where the hookah usually doesn't last very long and the prices are very reasonable with a lot of flavor options. The ambiance was little dull but this could have been because we did not come on a night with the DJ, there was just a playlist. The waitresses were very nice and attentive. Overall i will definitely be giving Harlem Hookah another visit in the future and hope that my experience the next time is better than the last although the last visit was not a terrible one.",

I\u2019m going to add an edit due to the response below. For clarification the music had nothing to do with a racial undertone as the response tried to imply. Yah played wack as hip hop and r&b let\u2019s be clear. And yes I will stay in the heights where they play up to date rap and r&b. Instead of addressing the real issue such as waiting 35 minutes for hookah at a hookah bar. The person responding deflects and makes it about about \u201cwhat they listen to uptown\u201d aka Dominican music. Trashy!!",

        "caption": "PATHETIC. Speaking from several different experiences I've had here. Read on...***Warning this review is VERY LONG.  First Experience - my license expired (literally) the day before we came here and we were not let in. I automatically knew something was off with this place, seeing as we immediately went downtown to Babylon (our usual spot) and got in without issue.  Second Experience - Got in, and literally before we even sat down we were rudely given a list of rules- I don't remember all of them but one in particular stuck out to me - \"we only accept cards that have a chip\". I was confused bc for one, I thought all cards had chips on them by now- and two, as a business you should be able to accept any form of payment someone gives you from cash all the way to gift card. This is common sense. Overall from this experience, outside of being totally turned off by the list of rules, it was mediocre. The hookah wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, although it was still subpar, and the music was pretty good. They are serious about the 2 hour time limit too (one of the rules we were told about before sitting down). That's a shame bc we actually would have stayed and got another hookah, but oh well.  Third Experience - We sat at the bar on a late afternoon. Everything was OK until I realized that the water turned brown in the base. They said it was bc the oils from the pineapple were dripping down into the water. After smoking hookah at least once a week for several years I've never seen that happen before. Not at Babylon, Falucka, Zoe Cafe, Pergola, my own home- literally I have never seen that happen so clearly, something isn't right.They ended up changing out the base for us, and it turned brown again. At this point we were over it and just wrapped up. I guess they tried.  Fourth Experience - The base turned brown again. We complained again and they said the same thing. The manager gave us a new one- and I expected the water to turn brown again, but surprisingly it didn't. What was done different I wonder? Still very weak on the flavoring. Despite that this experience wasn't horrible.  Fifth AND FINAL Experience - Came yesterday evening 12/15/18 around 7pm and (like all the other reviewers) waited outside for someone to come and seat us only to walk into a damn near empty place- it's only two of us so it's not like we would have taken up a lot of space just standing inside. Laughable. The hookah again was not great but we were still going to vibe. We preferred to sit at the bar, so when we saw some seats open up we moved over there. I go to the bathroom real quick and come back to a combative, pathetic excuse for an entry level \"manager\" aggressively moving my stuff back over to the table. What he was trying to say was \"I'm sorry guys, we have some people waiting outside for these seats so we'll need you to move back to the table\"- or he could have sat them at the table??? Instead he came over questioning my fiancee- \"who told you to come over here?\"(bar seating is always first come first serve) \"Did you even close out at the table?\" (the waiter can very easily close our bill while we're sitting right here)\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way\" - EXCUSE ME?! NOPE, NOPE, NOPE - BRING US THE BILL. We absolutely will not tolerate hood rat behavior from any so called \"manager on duty\". YOU ARE TRASH.  The fact is that we live so close to HH so we've given it several tries. After that last exchange with that miserable \"manager\" that really put the nail in the coffin. I hate that this place is the way that it is. There are so many little changes that can be made to make this place somewhat desirable. Stop reading off a bunch of rules, making people wait outside for literally no reason, having rude staff, having malfunctioning hookah's - to name a few. We never have these sorts of problems at any other hookah place we go to, so that's where we will continue to spend our money. I advise other's to do the same. At least we gave it a few good tries.",

We arrived around maybe, 6:16pm and the security guard checked our ID\u2019s and said \u201cgive me a second, i\u2019ll go get the hostess\u201d. At a normal establishment, you\u2019d think that this would mean you\u2019d be getting seasted shortly or AT THE LEAST, allowed inside to wait because it\u2019s only damn near winter outside. Nope, not here. Instead you wait outside while the hostess dances around, texting on her phone, chatting it up with all of everyone inside. Not to mention, it was dead in there. So there\u2019s actually no reason why the hostess was so very \u201cbooked and busy\u201d.  By now, frustrated as hell, we ask the bouncer what the hold up was and even he was saying how disrespectful what was happening was. By now the time is 6:36pm, asked to speak with a manager, takes him an additional several minutes to come out and I explained the situation and then the hostess comes out, says nothing to us...STILL all while the manager is being very combative with me telling me \u201cwe don\u2019t seat guest before their reservation time\u201d meanwhile it is now after our said reservation time and yet still, no one even bothered to come outside to tell us anything in regards to anything. Long story long, we did not end up staying. When this place first opened service was phenomal. As time went by, service has declined IMMENSELY. You want to try so hard to support local black businesses but it\u2019s truly hard when they do not value their customers with respect and exude the worst attitudes possible. Please do not waste your time coming here unless, you could care less about being treated the way many of the reviews say this establishment treats their customers.",

People who clearly are regulars go there and dont get out so I can imagine the loss in revenue when security initially dont let many ppl in and the few they do are again regulars just there for the hookah whilst the rest of us wait just to spend money that I'm almost certain the \"Regs\" wont (5 ppl 1 hookah maybe 2 appetizer?! \ud83e\udd28). The food was amazing taught the bartender how to properly make 3 of the 5 drinks I ordered but other than that not bad....If security decides to let ppl in other than the regulars or ppl they know",

I explained, as an asthmatic person that doesn\u2019t smoke \u2014 the extra hookah wouldn\u2019t be necessary. The hostess explained the \u201chouse\u201d policy, and again I explained that I don\u2019t smoke. Totally getting the policy and willing to spend an adequate amount to supplement the decision not to get second hookah, we made eye contact and the hostess then explained that the bar was available and we could sit and get one hookah. Not wanting to escalate situation and still wanting to treat my out of town guests well, we buckled and accepted the seats at the bar.  Generally house policies are understood, management should consider alternatives and appropriate accommodations for patrons that aren\u2019t able to comply for health reasons.",

I really was not going to write a review about this place because it's not even worth that, but considering how awful my friends and I were treated I must warn the world. Management does not only suck at this place, they are clearly crazy! We received the the worst service, having to wait for 30 mins, then allowing the party behind us to be seated before us ( same party size), then being told we have to purchase 2 hookahs for a party of 6 or we can't smoke hookah at all..... O YEAH they also gave my friend house liquor instead of the mango Ciroc he ordered. After making a complaint he got a new drink that actually tasted like mango ciroc. Sad! Why are y'all trying to rip people off ? O and by the way we had to experience some crazy party AT THE BAR arguing and threatening staff. WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON THE BOUNCER WAS HOLDING THE DOOR SHUT TO KEEP US INSIDE WITH THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. My friend had to ask the bouncer to let us out of the establishment hoping not to get hurt. Why keep a rowdy person inside the establishment and endanger everyone else??? Again poor decision making on managements part. SO if you are looking for a place to sell you bottom shelf liquor for top shelf prices, Rowdy people, unaccommodating management this is the place to be.  **Tiffany (owner, accused me on yelp) you can not accuse everyone who had a terrible time at your establishment that night of being part of that rowdy group. Sadly,  if you had put this much effort forth with customer service you could have received a wonderful review instead of a bad one. Be more proactive. ***",

Now understanding it\u2019s a hookah bar it wasn\u2019t my choice it was the birthday girl choice. The birthday girl and one other person wanted a hookah. However, it was 5 of us. So they told us that because it was 5 of us we had to get two hookah. I didn\u2019t understand this rule if only two people was smoking the hookah. Now once the server told us about the rule. We asked for the manager, this young lady came to the table and we explained our situation she was very understanding and told the waiter to just give it to them. I guess they felt as though we was going to sneak some of the hookah which is very childish. The money was never the issue however the waiter didn\u2019t like that the manager okay it. He  consistently kept talking to all the other staff members about it. About 10 minuets later another lady approached us and said that they couldn\u2019t have the hookah because it was 5 of us but as we explained to her only two people was smoking it. I asked what was her position she said she was the manager. For her to be a manager and get nasty with us with three missing teeth in her mouth was just very disgusting and unprofessional. She did all the neck popping, eye rolling, slick remarks when all we are trying to do is have a good time. The food was TRASHED & greasy . I was so upset my best friend birthday turned out like that. Then they had the NERVE to add gratuity to our bill (26.87) like are you serious. It was the worst experience EVER !!! Now the drinks was good I got tispy and left. My advice is work on the customer service skills.",

The place is beautifully decored. We ran a little late and had to wait at the bar. The bartender was very active and always checking in. We weren\u2019t seat until almost 1 hr and 30 mins. The hostess kept lying about the wait time and even made up a story about us making reservations for a bigger size party, claiming we had to wait for everyone to be there; but we only reserved for 2. We had to close out at the bar before we were seated. After ordering our meal we had to ASK for basics like water, utensils and napkins. Everytime we wanted service we had to consistently and actively work to gain our waitress attention. The experience was a real nightmare. It\u2019s unfortunate being so that the place has so much potential. They really lack tentative customer service. The drinks and food was good though.",
