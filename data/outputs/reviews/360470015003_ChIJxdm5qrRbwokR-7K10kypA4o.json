You get a medium sized bowl with beef slices and bok choy in a hot broth. I've definitely had more savory broth elsewhere! The chili oil they add is pretty spicy so I'd recommend getting little to no spice if spicy is not your jive. To customize, you can also choose between rice vs. round vs. flat wide noodles.  Pros: Fast service, lots of seating in this corner of the food hall  Cons: Portion sizes could've been larger, soup base was average",
