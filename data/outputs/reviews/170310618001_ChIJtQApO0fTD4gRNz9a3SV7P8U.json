BUT pricing was shady, why is a small cup of lemonade before you get anything \"special\" in it $5? Is this Starbucks...I'd get more lemonade there for 5$. Then the prices for the delta 8 (THC they have) additions didnt reflect that it was just the reg price of items and there was separate THC price (so like lemonade 5$ plus the THC price) you could quickly end up spending $30+ on just a small drink. Which is understandable if the strengths matched the pricing. I'd rather bought a delta 8 cart than had these treats for the price they currently are. Also delta 8 \"elevation \" comes and goes quickly... I liked the place but there definitely needs to be several improvements and better organization before I'm willing to go back and drop a lot of money there again. Also its cash only so bring at LEAST $50 cash before you go...per person. I really would give this 2.5 stars but 3 for benefit of the doubt.",

I purchased your Groupon. I had no idea thats the products that are sold. be more clear in your labeling that is something that is very important I could have lost my job if this was the case.  also the americano I ordered was alot to be desired and the almond milk was chunky.",

Each time,  I spent roughly $60 for some edibles and two drinks for my partner and I - she is not a frequent user but I am - and both times we barely felt anything.  The bag of infused gummy worms didn't do anything, even though I ate nearly the whole thing myself. The coffee didn't do anything for me either. The only saving grace was the chocolate chip cookie we split that actually gave us a decent feeling! But for only 1 product out of the several that I paid for to work is disappointing.  I wanna keep giving this place my business because I love the idea, the vibe, and the staff, but I don't know if I can bring myself to drive 40 minutes, wait in line another 30-60mins, and spend $60+ for barely any effect.",

        "caption": "Honestly the iced vanilla lavender coffee was great. But this place is pretty mediocre. We bought two coffees and two burritos and it came out to $65. If the food was good, I wouldn't be complaining. But unfortunately when I bit into the sweet n heat burrito it had a piece of plastic. Also, it didn't taste fresh or too tasty. Definitely edible (apart from the plastic) LOL... When I called to let the manager know he mentioned that the food is bought from an outside source not made in kitchen. I understand, things happen. But that means that we spent over $40 on burritos that are premade.. Really all they did was add the THC in the salsa verde. Thank god for that because it definitely helped the experience. I'm all about spending money on good food but this was pretty disappointing. Also, the man who works there told me that I can do a pre order because I was on a time crunch.. I told him I would call back in 5 mins for my order. When I called back a lady answered and got kind of upset when I brought that up because I guess that's not something they do. I appreciate him working with us but there needs to be communication there. She put me on a brief hold after saying they can't do the pre order, and then the man that I spoke with got on the phone and sounded kind of upset that I was calling back (even though he told me it was okay) and took my order, then said in a upset tone \"this is the last time we are doing this for you just so you know\". I would've never called back with an order of pre ordering was an issue, he literally told me that was okay. I don't want to feel like i'm inconveniencing someone at all, I know how it is in the food industry. I just felt like more of a burden coming in. Once I got in, they were both extremely friendly and welcoming. VERY cute little spot. I might be back for the coffee. But to be honest after trying the food I was pretty disappointed. Hopefully they start making food in their kitchen that's fresh when the pandemic is over! Kudos to you guys for the great idea and sweet spot! Wish you the best.",

I also purchased a chocolate chip cookie that was dosed at 50 mg, the cookie was fresh and soft, but most certainly packed with a punch! About 1 hour into my delightful treats I started to feel full body relaxation and of course, some giggles! This is definitely the spot if you want to \"treat yo-self!\"",

I also tried the cinnamon coffee cake muffin which was priced at $10 with 40mg, but again felt nothing. Given I paid $40.00 for my entire order (which did taste good nonetheless), I just would have expected better end results. Maybe lower prices given the amount of THC perhaps.

The line was extremely long but it was probably because of the chai latte that had gone viral on Twitter a couple days prior. I started out in line by the Jewel and it took a little over 1.5 hours to get to the front door. Staff was super friendly and patient while I ordered since it was my first time there and I wasn\u2019t well aquatinted with the menu. I ordered a dirty iced chai latte with 90mg of THC added. Since I weigh around 200 lbs it usually takes about 30 mg of THC or more for me to feel some type of high. I drank the whole thing within 30 minutes and after 2.5 hours I barely felt a slight buzz. Once that buzz went away I ate a whole bag of the gummy edibles. The barista said that the bags were 50mg each; the first bag had gummy bears and sour patch kids. After 1.5 hours I was zooted. I was a upset that the $10 bag of gummies worked better than my $20 dollar latte, but at last I was actually high. I had another bag of gummies I was excited about, so I ate the whole bag of lip shape gummies the next day and expected the same result as the bag from yesterday but absolutely NOTHING happened. Not even a buzz. I\u2019m not a heavy smoker and I do not smoke everyday so I don\u2019t understand why the edibles did not hit. I\u2019m disappointed in the inconsistency of the product. The staff was super nice and the lobby was clean, had good music playing and was very decorative. Definitely a good vibe. The product was not worth the $50 spent.",

Chicago is in its 1st year of the recreational cannabis program & as far as that goes it's just dispensaries where you can buy products there are no places here in the City where you're getting actual THC-A infused Teas & Coffees that are strain specific, for that experience you would have to go somewhere in Colorado, California, Oregon or Washington; where the laws are more developed to allow such a concept. If it was actually weed with how the prices are currently, those drinks would cost $25/$40.  This is an establishment what some would consider 'tease beverages', sorry to say but that's not the actual white widow strain or Ak-47 mixed in with your drink, plenty of other places do this when naming their menu items i.e Cheeba Hut.  As someone who's from Colorado where it's normal to see marijuana mixed in with food at certain coffee shops/dab lounges this was kinda a let down.  However they did have some great veggie burritos as well as their sweets & The staffs service was very welcoming & kind.",

I got 2 thc infused White Widow coffees, with three 25mg shots each(after reading they were on the lighter side). I also purchased the Delta 8 Piggy which seemed more like a whipped cream filled brick. My girlfriend couldn't even bite through it without hurting her teeth, but I tried to keep an open mind. I took the burden of finishing it. After leaving and getting back in my car, my coffee lid breaks. Plastics lands in my cup, and coffees spills on me. I reluctantly fished it out, and I tried my coffee only to find it unsweetened. It was a cozy little shop with nice staff but I won't be returning.",

Both the quality of the coffee and decor were a big improvement on the previous place.  Being lactose intolerant myself, I appreciated the plethora of non-diary options. There were plenty of options of non-coffee options such as tea and hot chocolate for my family who aren't coffee drinkers. The owner was very nice and accommodating. We didn't try any CBD products, but Wake-N-Bake offers that as well. We came to Chicago on a rather cold winter day because I had a late flight at O'hare. We also had my parent's dog with us, as it was a long trip from where they live, it was too cold to leave her outside, and our dog has been having seizures so we were hesitant to leave her at home. Unfortunately, it's hard to find inside dog-friendly places in winter. The owner was very accommodating and let us bring our dog inside with us and rearrange the chairs to sit together, which was greatly appreciated.",
