The pork had a rich flavor which is hard to imitate at home. I forgot the name of the noodle we got but it was delicious. The broth was not overly salty yet had tons of taste. Service was above average. Price of lunch was dirt cheap. I would definitely recommend this to any china town visitors.  Try the BBQ pork CHEERS!!",

My family and I walked in during a cold and rainy day, as we settled in our server brought over some tea (about the nicest thing she did the whole time) and stood beside us impatiently tapping her foot. Keep in mind its winter so as we settled in we are taking off our hats and scarves and coats. Suddenly out of no where she goes to the far end of the room and starts screaming in her native language. We have no idea what it was about. it was such an awkward and hostile environment, everyone looked at us and we had no clue what was going on. Only reason we stayed was because we were really hungry. We ordered fried rice which arrived quickly and duck which took much longer  but they only gave us a plate and fork. No knife. No napkins.  Overall: horrible service, awkward uncomfortable environment, okay food. If I could I'd give them half a star because the food was alright.",

One cannot judge a book by its cover because the food here is pretty good.  The meats are succulent, never dried out. The roasted meats have crispy skin and the steamed meats have delicious, juicy skin on the outside and tender meat on the inside. My personal favorites are the roasted duck and soy sauce steamed chicken. The portions are generous even for 2 people or one really hungry person.  Even though the service is nothing to be wowed over, and the place looks somewhat run down and dreary, the quality of the food here more than makes up for it. Plus, it's really good value for money with you consider their prices.  One thing to note though, is that credit cards are only accepted for orders above $10. Otherwise they'll tack on a service fee if you use your credit card so for small orders, it's best to have cash.",
