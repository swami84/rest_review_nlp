I had called back a second time because I couldnt find them on Seamless, until I learned you can just click on the Seamless link they have listed on their website.  I went to Ubereats, Seamless and Grubhub and they dont have the full menu. We wanted to order dinner and dessert. None of the apps have the dessert available. Considering what an accommodating place this is in person, its very disappointing we cannot order food from here unless you want to pickup dessert from another place., Food is phenomenal though and so is the service when you dine -in.",

The host asked if it was a special occasion and I stated yes, it was my daughters birthday. We ordered appetizers which were small portions, but they were tasty. Our meal was disappointing, very small portions for the amount of money. How do you serve french fries with a $42-$59 dollar steak? The skirt steak was two small pieces, the roasted chicken was the size of my palm with a spoonful of sweet potato, also the roasted duck was all fat. The drinks were expensive for the size of the glass. No waitress or waiters came over and sang Happy Birthday. When we were finished eating the staff kept rushing us to leave so they could free up the two tables which was very rude and on top of it all they had the nerve to charge gratuities, tips are up to the consumer based on the food and service provided. Also get ready for the $8 valet parking.",

Skirt steak was  flavored well with  chimmichurri but the side dishes lacked flavored. After eating, We specifically asked for the tomahawk steak bone to be wrapped to go ( 3 times ) after paying 115 for that dish. we were highly disappointed when we noticed they never put it out bag, Its the least they could of done after paying the amount of money we did at this place. i found this place to be overpriced, for what they offer which is only the ambience. this place does have  dresscode and they automatically add gratutity. i drove over an hour to be snapped at and rushed, we will not be returning.",

Not really impressed with food choices and not enough to choose from. Sushi appetizer \u201cventanas roll\u201d was delicious  Bad: Very limited menu choices for Valentines fixed menu. It was my first time there so can\u2019t compare it to regular days menu. They offered FREE dessert if each customer will order appetizer + entree. Then we realized they were offering \u201ccotton candy\u201d for dessert??  None of the guests at the table liked cotton candy including myself and when we brought it up to our server then he offered an alternative which was pretty good.  It was a small dessert sampler and it was delicious. Too bad it had to be asked for.  Entrees were only \u201cprotein\u201d... meaning, you got the protein of your choice which were at this time: filet mignon, chicken, salmon, lobster.... however the dish will not come with any sides -_-   We ordered the filet mignon ($90) which was a delicious piece of steak cooked to like, but that was all on the dish. My friend ordered Salmon and was same,  however her piece was pretty small so not enough food even for a lady. :/  Drinks took too long.  Our server was nice but I got the impression there were not enough servers around.  Lots of hosts walking people to tables but I didn\u2019t see many servers attending tables so drinks took way long.  My overall rating goes to ambiance/decor and Filet Mignon steak.  Not sure if I would go back. Many other places like Son Cubano or Q\u2019Tal that have beautiful ambiance, great service, great drinks and excellent Chef made food for less than Ventanas.  I originally gave the place a 4-star; after Owners\u2019 response to my review, it is clearly a 3 star restaurant. The lack of service was definitely not a \u201cone time\u201d occasion based on how he responds to customers.",

The tiny bit of champagne poured in our glasses for our toast was laughable. It was part of the pre fixe and probably the saddest thing I've ever seen, and disrespectful in my opinion. I've been to other restaurants and recieved a full glass of champagne for a toast on the house. Moving on. The food was terribly small portions. Sushi tasted ok but guess what? It wasn't fresh and I spent the rest of the evening and following day in the bathroom with food poisoning. The entrees had no sides included for the price. Steak with no mashed potatoes or vegetable accompaniments. Chicken came with no rice or pasta. I've gone to 5 star restaurants in NYC and recieved better food for the same price. Dessert was also small in portion but ok in taste. Honestly deciding whether I should call my credit card company for a refund which I feel the restaurant owes me for terrible overpriced food. Avoid this place and try your luck elsewhere along the Jersey waterfront. The hype is not worth hurting your pocket over. Head to Lower Manhattan and go to one of the finer restaurants to get a bang for your buck.",

He put one of the guests at the end of the table with no space, but then I asked the server few minutes after and she added the table because she saw the amount I was ordering.

        "caption": "My friend and I went there to have a nice evening and unwind to some fine dining. Unfortunately, that is not what we received. Although our server was very kind, we were both HIGHLY disappointed with the food. The salmon is very dry and bland (although they did say salmon is cooked medium here) and they put it over (what tasted like) marinara sauce, that did not compliment the salmon at all. I am usually never disappointed in salmon, especially in a high establishment but I was severely dissatisfied and even more upset that no one question why I only ate 25% of my plate. Working in the resturant industry for about 17 years now, BOTH as a resturant Manager and Bar tender/server, that would have been an immediate red flag that something was wrong, and I would have asked the customer how I could have made it better. More than half was left on my plate, and instead of asking if there was anything wrong, they just took it away, WITHOUT even asking if I was finished either. They also took our Guac and chips away without us even finishing it. My friend order the Pork Special which was extremely dry and NOT flavorful. She then went to order Sushi instead, and when we ordered one roll, the server never told us, in order to make it an \"entree\" you have to order 2 rolls. No where on the menu does it say that it is MANDATORY to order 2 rolls. We did not want an entree but they pressured us to order two rolls, to make up for the cost of the pork, it was pretty obvious. And then came up with the excuse \"you can't just dine with us without both of you ordered a entree because we have been having people just sit here and only order drinks and appetizers\" MEANWHILE  that was never stated prior to us making reservations NOR is that stated in the menu NOR did our server tell us that. I understand businesses are hurting due to COVID, but there is no need to FORCE customers to order more than they want. When you go to places like this, you already have the mind set \"I'm going there to treat myself and with the price of this menu, I want to make sure my experience is worth every penny especially during these hard times\"  At the end, a table of 6 comes in, and for 40 minutes straight all they kept doing was taking pictures right next to our table, and I am sorry, unless I am getting paid, I do not want to be in a random strangers photos, and the manager did NOTHING ABOUT IT even though that side of the resturant was complaining and staring and shaking their heads. There are people who have disabilities where flashing lights can really cause them seizures, so that was very very unprofessional to allow such a thing to continue for 40 MINUTES STRAIGHT. Not just 1 picture here and there but a full PHOTO SHOOT with every female at that table who were half naked by the way. I guess they are only strict to the dress code for men, but let women be half naked having full photoshoots while people are trying to eat and enjoy the company they came with, or even just their own company. Very distracting and really took away for the entire experience and beautiful ambience of the place.  I will say the best part of that experience, was my cocktail, and my friends Pinot Grigio. That is very sad, having to pay $160 for food that was terrible!",

The crab cake special appetizer and the apple caramel tacos were very delicious though.  My friend ordered the steak and it comes with fries, for a pricey dish, that\u2019s a bad side. You can\u2019t even replace it or at least that\u2019s what the waiter said. So she had to order an extra side, we didn\u2019t even have the sides described yo us. The waiter seemed overwhelmed too, we were a large group. We were told that they do not split bills too, it\u2019s 2021, that\u2019s not cool.

The gentlemen taking care of valet were very welcoming and really set a nice tone for the evening.  When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by two sweet hostesses who took our temperature and asked us to fill out a precautionary form to ensure we were not potentially ill (with covid). I felt very comfortable and at ease knowing they're taking the health of their customers seriously.  Once we were seated, out amazing server ensured we were well taken care of. Our drinks, appetizers, & meals were all absolutely delicious and came out in perfect time & order. The venue & ambiance itself was also stunning & really made our dinner that much more beautiful.  I highly recommend Ventanas & will most definitely be back!",

        "caption": "Attended here on Dec 21, 2020 for a party of 8 birthday dinner. What we enjoyed upon entering the establishment was the safety precautions and contact less approach with signing the nondisclosure agreement, and accessible menus online. There were a number of discrepancies that were not specified and some of the staff are not on the same page when information is conveyed. When making reservations online with OpenTable it stated for parties 7 or more a three hour + time limit. On the Ventanas website and mini table menu it indicates for all parties due to Covid, there is an hour and a half seating arrangement for all parties. We were advised by our server that the hour and a half was true due to the new restrictions, they would ensure our food would come out in a timely manner and we would be able to enjoy everything. Our group ordered an array of food; lobster dumplings, octopus and chorizo kabobs, k-town wings, dragon rolls, and a round of drinks. Our drinks came with in 15 minutes with water served immediately. The lobster dumplings were okay, slightly undercooked, and we tasted more cilantro then lobster itself. The octopus and chorizo kabobs were slightly cold, and the k-town wings were a bit tough to chew. I would assume because they are cooked in a broiler quickly and tossed in a sauce that was a tad bit salty.The sushi was amazing! I would say the servers were very attentive at first. The problems began to arise when our food was being rushed out due to trying to maintain the time ordnance under the Covid restrictions. At this point we were already there for over an hour our appetizers came out behind schedule due to the sushi bar being backed up. We knew things weren't going to go as planned as errors occur, totally understandable. By the time the entr\u00e9es came out it was already passed an hour. We ordered; (2)miso salmon one cooked medium and the other well, (2) rack of ribs one with shrimp and the other with fries, (2) branzino and artichoke puree, a steak and their special vegan meal. Now here is where the problem arises, our food came back and the size of the salmon was disappointing for the amount of money being spent paired with the vegetable fried rice that only had scallions in it and the rice was plated as if one scoop was thinly stretched across the plate. Not to mention the salmon was dry. You could tell it was rushed out. The menu indicated rack of ribs and we assumed we would get a rack if not half a rack. The rack consisted of 3 baby back ribs (to be honest they were the smallest pieces and could easily equal 2 ribs total for $35 dollars per plate) each and what appeared to be bland cocktail shrimp with one of the orders.When I brought this to the staffs attention we were advised 4 ribs come with a rack by one staff member and 3 from another. Once the manager was called we were told  a \"rack of ribs\" was defined as multiple. The manager was able to comp. our order by adding additional 4 ribs to both meals and recreate one of the miso salmon dishes. This time the order looked totally different and looked like a quality meal was produced. We were pleased although felt like for the amount of money was being spent that should of never happened to begin with even under pressure in the kitchen. People leave any establishment with the following in mind; service, food, and drinks. Collectively we thought some things were okay, however we won't be back.",

Plantains and shrimp tempura were delicious. The crab cake special with the pretzels was not good either. The champagne dream with rose ($45) was very good.

Appetizers: octopus and chorizo - lacked flavor shrimp cocktail - perfect...  Main dish: Pork shank was fried however I could not cut through the skin to get to the meat. I was afraid that the shank would fly off the plate and land on my date's lap. So not to make a scene or send it back I just delayed eating. The waitress was great and brought me a steak knife, but even with the ridges I could not easily cut through the fried skin in the shank. After finally getting through I expected the inside meat to be falling off the bone, but again I had to saw through the pork with the steak knife. The rice was bland and I had to mix in the plum sauce to get some flavor. The maduros were dry.  Branzino was flipped skin side up which was less appealing since the expectation is the cut easily through the fluffy fish and eat the skin after. My date doesn't eat the skin so she had to flip it over and almost lost it on the table. I am ok with chef's trying new things but this one should be left alone.  Sweet potato side was tasty but skin side up made it look less desirable and again we flipped it to avoid the skin.  If management contacts me and wants another chance I would be happy to give them another try.",

The pricing is good for the quality of the food. The staff were all kind, attentive, helpful and accommodating.  The place is upscale, dress and act classy, don't bring the trouble makers if you know what I am saying. We all have a few of those in our circle. The ambience and decor is so fresh and modern.  The menu has just enough options to not box you in and not so many that it overwhelms you. Honestly I had a hard time choosing what to get because the menu doesn't have any fluff. Everything sounded amazing and from the party of 8 I went with they delivered on the plate as well.  The service is great, no problems there. I liked that they weren't robots and felt very comfortable. Lots of places now are rushing people in and out and I have to say I felt none of that here. In these times where safety is a concern, the place was very clean and everyone wore their masks which was much appreciated. They have valet parking so that's a nice bonus. I don't want to say the place isn't kid friendly but its definitely not catered for children. They accommodated us with the two children we had in the party and were very prompt with what we needed for them. I would say if you have the choice get a sitter. Definitely an adult themed place.  Don't hesitate to visit if you were interested, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

Had lunch and ordered the tomahawk steak for 2 but honestly I cook a better steak at home . There was no flavor and meat was chewy . For $115 u would expect something better. My advice would be to come here for a drink at the bar maybe an appetizer but get a meal elsewhere. In my opinion if your looking for a good steak.  Peter luger is still hands down my favorite.",

Price has to be comparable to the location, the quality of food, and the experience. There are better locations in New York, Edgewater, Weehawken. My take on everything. I went there after seeing it a few times. I am a health care business owner I went on a date there with another business owner. Two very unassuming, lowkey people. I didn\u2019t want to eat much (post phase 1 covid )some of us are on diet. I ordered and my date ordered. The waiter left and the manager appeared stating we must both order a certain quantity of food. I would have liked it if the waiter mentioned it first. The manager appearing in a situation that didn\u2019t involve him, when a problem was never presented to the guest by the waiter, caught us ( the guest off guard). We obliged, went ahead and ordered. We ordered food, both my date and I didn\u2019t even want to eat. We were literally forced to order. The price wasn\u2019t our problem, however for what we received  or the price the average person would not be pleased, compared to other similar locations in the same area.  After being informed to order more by the manager the waiter was inattentive to us. We waited for a long time. My date wanted us to change the waiter but I insisted we keep her. I managed to get the managers attention who then informed the waiter to attend to us.  I rarely write reviews because business depend on good reviews. However I must say I was disappointed in my experience.  The place is set against a great scenic background. Great for pictures. But that\u2019s is all.",

And the food was priced 10x more than it was worth, also took over 25 minutes to arrive. Both the appetizer and the food.  My lobster dumplings were disgusting. And so was the lobster meal my mother had, and the sweet potato wedges were also bad. The guacamole was bland. And that lobster tasted like it was about to spoil. But my sweet, sweet  mother ate it because she had waited so long, she didn\u2019t want to leave without eating anything.  Our server had an attitude problem. When we told her that we didn\u2019t like the food she immediately asked why with an attitude and didn\u2019t ask if we wanted anything instead, or bothered to apologize. Neither did the manager, he was also rude. She also didn\u2019t sing happy birthday to my mother, and we were hearing birthday songs all through the night. Must have been at least 5 other birthdays going on that night. Even as we were walking out they sang happy birthday to someone. But WE didn\u2019t get a song for some reason. The manager when he came over simply asked what was wrong with the food and then proceeded to tell me that the lobster dumplings were one of the most popular dishes at the restaurant like it was going to make me want to finish it. I left there disgusted and needless to say didn\u2019t leave our incompetent rude waitress a tip. My mother, brother and I ALL THREE ARE WAITERS. For me especially, bad service is a huge pet peeve. We know what it\u2019s like both to give and receive good service. Will never recommend this place to anyone as long as i live. I tipped the valet guy though, he was running across the street with each car he had to go get, he was great. The hosts and the bathroom lady were also great with us  Edit: Here\u2019s your information- In the future if you truly want to rectify your mistake for hiring these cooks and staff, or at least if you want to lead me to believe that that\u2019s your goal, you can maybe use my first name and/or repeat a couple of examples of what i described. I do not remember any of the employees names. I was fuming for the last 30 minutes of our visit. If you want more information you can re-read my review as i didn\u2019t miss or exaggerate anything.",

The bartener brings over my drink TASTE terrible , we let him know, he remakes it and its worse., I watch him make 3rd drink....totally wrong. He then admits he doesn't know how to make the drink....WHAT? why then do you keep trying to make a drink you don't know how to make it in the firstplaceor.

Never heard that ever in all the restaurants we have been to, but they said it was mandatory for each person to order entree.

We had the a la carte jumbo shrimp (which means you get to choose how many you want), the oysters, guacamole, branzino, and the mango passionfruit dessert. The jumbo shrimp live up to the name. They were cleaned very well and tasted great and you had a slice of lemon for each serving. The oysters had mini pineapple, mango, and cucumbers on top and served with lemon as well. These were stellar! The guacamole had a pineapple/mango twist to it, that was refreshing and delicious. The guacamole is served with plantain chips. The branzino fish was spectacular as it literally just melted apart. This was served on a bed of artichoke puree with some diced peppers surrounding the fish, which were great flavors together. The mango passionfruit dessert is a must have, even if you don't think you can eat another bite of food. It is definitely the culmination to the great experience as it is plated artistically with mango and raspberry notes. The vanilla sponge cake layer was great, but so was every other layer, like the white chocolate mousse and the candied almonds! We will be back to try other items on the menu that sound fantastic! Thank you for ending our experience on a positive note and total satisfaction!",

When I walked in the ambiance was gorgeous inside and out. The hostess told me where to sit and it went downhill from there. The waiter Chris seemed so discombobulated and flustered. A lot of things he did just didn't make sense for example him taking orders was a weird process and unorganized. I ordered a champagne drink, the most expensive drink ever lol of $39,  and there was a process he had to do to make it and it spilled all over.  One of the ladies that was in my party ordered the goat cheese and spinach empanadas and she tasted there was different cheeses in there which she couldn't eat. Chris said he will bring over the manager Manny and boy was he rude. He made it seem like it was her fault even though it wasn't listed on the menu.  I also ordered sweet potato wedges and the girls ordered different things. When the food came out it looked good but the taste was not so good. Only one girl really liked her meal. For the expense of everything you would of thunk the food would of been great. Not so much and the service was not good either, but I will give it to Chris he at least tried. Will I be back, No.",

Quarantine deprived us of our special moments spending tg but dining here at Ventanas last night brought all the sparks back in the matter of the 90min dining experience. If you anyone has the luxury of dining here expect great service, amazing presentation & delicious food. Kenny (who was my server, I suggest you guys request him) went above & beyond to not only make us feel welcomed & at home but safe & comfortable. Which is a new aspect of the dining experience us guests now seek. The manager Travis made a humbling appearance. And that combined with the exceptional service made the evening perfect. A very elegant place, will definitely be back.",

Eight of us went last night with for a group birthday celebration. I had been to the restaurant before and had experienced some patchy service quality here and there but nothing this bad. First we had to wait a very long time for our drinks to come. Some of us women wanted to order 2 appetizers and the servor said: NO! There is a new rule. You have to order main dish. We said we\u2019ll order more appetizers and he said that\u2019s the rule now! I would like the manager to respond here and explain how and since when this rule has started!!! Please post this rule to your website as it is highly unusual.  After ordering is done, we wait 45-50 minutes for the main dish to arrive except for one... whitch arrived 15 minutes after we all had gotten our main dish. No one was hungry to eat because we had waited soo long. Finally we are finished with food and as we are debating about dessert, we ask for another chair for a friend that was arriving late. And the servor said: Sorry you guys have to leave now we want to put another group here!!!! I look at him in shock and he said: \u201cwe are setting up for another group\u201d We could have said no and ordered 10 desserts and lingered there. But none of us had the desire to stay there and tolerated the rude behavior we went to another location for dessert. Very disappointing service. Extremely rude servors. Waiter and waitesss training needs complete overhaul. I look forward to an answer from Ventanas. Thank you",

She told me she was only seating people with reservations and just ignored me. So I made a reservation on open table and then she just rolled her eyes at me and said you can wait at the bar. We made the reservation at 9:45 for 2 and we did not get seated until 10:45. We get seated and the room was very cold and at this point we just order the food and our food was cold too.

Spoke with multiple \u201cmanagers\u201d saying they\u2019ll \u201ctake care of us\u201d after we complained for slow kitchen service and nothing changed.  I even overheard other people complaining that their experience was also ridiculous and that they still didn\u2019t get their meals either and that they had to leave.  One manager even admitted that they dropped the ball and overbooked.  For $250pp I can honestly say I\u2019ll never come back here again.

First thing we noticed as we walked in was that the music and ambience were kind of nice, somewhat of a Miami lounge feel.  We started with drinks, thought we should try their signature cocktails. So we ordered their Old Fashioned and Capirinha - was not impressed. The drinks tasted a bit watered down.  For the appetizer, we had the Empanadas which was pretty okay.  For the entrees, we ordered the Branzino Puree and Scallops with Octopus.  The entrees took 45 minutes to come out and we noticed the table next to us received theirs first although our orders were placed before them. The presentation was nice, however, the Branzino was mediocre and the Scallops with Octupus was wayyy too salty. The Octupus also tasted burnt.  I have to say this place was pretty disappointing, especially, for what they charge. I would have thought it would be more than just a nice interior.  This was an honest review and we do not see ourselves as a repeat customer or recommending this place.",

Clearly management, bartender and hostess seen us walk in since there were hardly no customers in the restaurant. It was distasteful and it killed our whole vibe. Do better!!!",

The entire experience was awful. The hostess was notified of my food allergy when the reservations were made yet they still served food that I was not able to eat. The drinks were horrible - the caipirinha d'uva was made by dropping 2 uncrushed grapes into the glass (see photo). We sent back the other drink because it tasted awful. Then we received the wrong plates - ordered dragon rolls and received shrimp tempura rolls. The Sea Scallops & Octopus dish was pretty bad as well - the octopus did not taste good and the tomatoe sauce was spicy which the waiter said it wasnt. This restaurant has several wine options according to the menu but when I tried to order the waiter had to tell me it wasnt available for atleast 3 different types of wines. This experience was extremely underwhelming and not worth the time and cost of eating there. The staff has not been well trained and are not knowledgeable about the food/drinks.",

Sure enough, the order comes in with onions, to what the waiter stated that the avocado had very small chopped onions... well when you are allergic to it, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a small piece or large. The regular coffee is no good. Paris Baguette and Starbucks serve better coffee. Asked for a high chair for my nephew, the chair that was given had a broken closure. The music was way too loud for a brunch, you can\u2019t hear anyone at your table. The only good thing that this restaurant has is its location and some what interesting interior design.",

The guacamole appetizer was perfectly seasoned. For the main course, the duck was cooked well, but I wish the skin had either been removed or was crispy - probably my only issue with the meal. The onion rings were some of the best I've had - perfectly crispy on the outside. For dessert, the chocolate hazelnut cake was moist and decadent with a crispy kit-kat like wafer in the middle for texture.  The cocktails were decent. The dirty martini and smoked Manhattan were good, but not anything overly exciting.  Definitely a place I'll return to in the future.",

We were a table of 8 and he served our table as if we were his only one. We requested for our drinks to be made by Anastasia, the outdoor bartender, bc her French Martini was perfectly made! As well as all other drinks we had. (We started our drink with her outside and then ordered the same drink once we were seated inside, and the drink was not the same.... Kenny was professional and got all of our drinks from Anastasia for the rest of the night!)  We enjoyed the apps and sushi more than the entrees.
