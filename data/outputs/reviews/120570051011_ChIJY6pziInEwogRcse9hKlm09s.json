Before I ordered I asked if the dinner comes with an egg or spring roll and was told no. So I ordered 1 portion of the chicken rolls (which weren't good)and got 3 for $4.95. So for 17.95  I got rice, chicken and 3 rolls. The panang  chicken was good but not the very best I've ever had. The best thai food I have ever had was in Orlando and you get 4 rolls, salad and an entre for $14 dollars and the portions are very big. The restaurant itself was clean, the people were nice and the food came out very hot and fast.",

Today I the Chicken Cashew Stir Fry, a decent sized serving of chicken, veggies, cashews in a delicious sauce served alongside a half cup or so of fluffy white rice in the shape of a heart. Plate presence is excellent. The meal comes with a spring roll and rice soup. The service is friendly and pretty quick, even during a downtown lunchtime. Only complaints regarded temperature. The soup was slightly less than lukewarm, and the restaurant itself was freezing. I shivered may way through and was happy to get outside to thaw out. Great lunch... but bring a jacket.",

They have a great assortment of beers (Singha, Kirin, and some specialty local brew). I had the red that was very tasty. We started with fried calamari, and spring rolls (both veggie and chicken). These were all basic. The calamari was underwhelming - only the rings and battered in a way that made them look like onion rings. My favorite calamari are the little squid like calamari and there were none to be found sadly. I ordered the Massaman Curry and the Drunken Noodles. They gave us an option of heat; light, medium, hot and Thai hot. We picked light noodles and medium Curry. The Curry definitely had a kick that I appreciated but I don't think I'd want to experience Thai hot hah I might not make it through. I tried the Thai Iced Tea that was incredibly tasty but it generally always is (I'm a huge fan). The server was very attentive and while he took the time to split our bills without asking he did jumble up some items on wrong checks so we venmo-ed each other which was odd.  Overall, if you want solid Thai cuisine, I recommend Si-am.",

        "caption": "We were one of maybe four tables and service was incredibly slow, especially for a restaurant in the middle of downtown at lunch time. My lunch companion quite literally had to ask for her food to be brought out (some 20 minutes after my food had been delivered) when it became clear that they'd forgotten about her meal.  Her fried rice was room temperature and had solidified into a mass. Clearly it had been prepared for some time but was not brought to our table. I had flavorful but lukewarm soup and we shared a tasty small plate of fried tofu. The small portion of rice soup and mini-spring roll that comes with lunch are a nice touch, though the roasted garlic used in the soup was very, very strong. We also enjoyed the Thai tea. Had the food been served timely and hot, I'd be giving a much different review.",
