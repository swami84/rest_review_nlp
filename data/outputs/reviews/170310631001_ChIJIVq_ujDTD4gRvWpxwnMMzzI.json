The fettuccine alfredo was delicious, and the portion size of the parmesean fries was extremely generous for just $2.99 - it was a full pasta container\u2019s worth. They also included a cute Valentine\u2019s Day chocolate heart. Will definitely be ordering again!",

Ordered a Large Pepperoni Thin Crust Pizza and it was really good! It came with a complimentary salad which was a nice touch considering I was debating ordering a salad. Definitely will get it again!  Only con would be the website needs a little work. Had a difficult time finding the menu outside of the \u2018order online\u2019 page and when I attempted to order online it said the restaurant was closed. I ended up calling and was able to order that way.  It\u2019s a really new place so they probably need a little bit of time to work out to kinks of website but the food is the important part and they got that figured out!",
