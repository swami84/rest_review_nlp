Khaki soi, which is rare to find on a menu and is normally awesome, was bland.  The stand out was the roti with massaman dipping sauce. But we are 100% going back to our other neighborhood favorite.",

There are plenty of them around but this one tops with its combination of delicious food, great service and lovely ambience. Been here 2 times now, once for the lunch special and once for dinner. Left extremely satisfied both times. Its been themed as a Bangkok style eatery and the walls are adorned with lovely black and white prints of the Thai capital. I love that they've taken the effort to create a different ambience from the general cookie cutter variety you see in most Thai places.  My go to at any Thai place is the Massaman curry and Kor Tor Mor delivered a winner on that front when I had it for the lunch special. Came with thai salad and spring rolls and was a steal at under $10. Returned for dinner based on the positive lunch experience and was not disappointed. Had the Rad Prik Tofu which was spicy and flavorful, not just blinded doused with hot sauce. The corn fritter appetizer was fantastic as was the roti canai. Service was friendly and quick. Will definitely be back to try more things from the menu.",

Service: We were seated at 7:40 and it took 1 hour from the moment we ordered to get only the appetizers. Also the main courses for our table of 6 came out 2 at a time and the last 2 dishes didn\u2019t come until everyone was almost done eating. All while the take out orders were flying out the door. On top of all that, our waiter never stopped by to say how\u2019s the food or perhaps tell us why the food was taking longer then usual.  Food:  Flavor of the lamb salad, papaya salad, fried calamari, pad Thai, drunken noodle, green curry and fried fish were all pretty good. Nice portion size and strong flavors.  I wouldn\u2019t recommend dining in, better to order out. Best to wait until they get the kitchen service in line before stopping by unless you have time to kill.",

However, tonight after waiting for an hour and a half (30 minutes past the scheduled delivery time) I called and asked for the status of my order. They clearly couldn't figure out where it was so just told me it was with the delivery person and that it would be delivered within ten minutes. 20 minutes later I called back and they told me they would call the delivery person to check. Ten minutes later, no call, so we called and said if it wasn't going to be there soon we would just cancel. The lady on the phone just said \"Okay, we cancelled it for you. Thanks, bye!\" And then she abruptly hung up. No apologies, no acknowledgement, nothing. We finally ate from somewhere else three hours after we had planned. Extremely unpleasant and rude customer service. Would not recommend this place.",

It seems rare for this to happen in this neighborhood.  Secondly, they have dishes that I've not seen elsewhere.  Pad Kee Mao is a Thai staple in America; Kor Tor Mor offers this, of course, but they also offer a version with thick, meaty Udon noodles.  If you want to be adventurous, try the Pad Cha.  Do I know exactly what's in there?  No.  I've never even seen this dish before, and Thai has been my favorite cuisine for the better part of two decades.  It's hard to describe - but delicious.  The portions are invariably generous, and they don't skimp on the protein of choice (or vegetables, if you lean that way), the vegetables are always fresh and crisp, as opposed to wilty and overdone, and once they get to know a regular customer, they often include a little something extra.  This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the nabe.  Give it a try; you won't be sorry that you did.",

        "caption": "Ordered take out from Kor Tor Mor yesterday through Yelp Eats and am glad I did.  I was craving Pad Thai and this definitely suited my craving. I ordered medium and it was pretty spicy. Almost too spicy for me but just barely. If you're questioning it and aren't a big fan of super spiciness, I'd suggest going a level down from what you're thinking. (It's a five level range.) I also got dumplings but I wasn't a big fan... they were kind of (definitely) STUFFED with meat and I didn't really like that. I also got the glass noodle vegetable soup (there were two people for all of this as you might be wondering by now) and it was good. Not too much flavor but it was good. It hit the spot.  Yelp Eats said it would be between 45-60 minutes, but the delivery guy was to my place within 30 minutes which was great. Overall, my experience was good and easy and I'd definitely order take out from here again.",

Kor Tor Mor is delicious, authentic fare served in a welcoming atmosphere.  The space is airy and hip with delightful natural details like the banana plants and bamboo family-style tables. The staff are super helpful and willing to answer questions/provide suggestions- no New York freeze here!  The lunch special is a fantastic deal at 8 bucks for a veggie tofu or meat entree AND appetizer. A full meal for under 10?! Yes, please. I had the drunken noodles- prefect texture, generous chicken and vegetables and I left feeling full but not heavy. The Coconut soup is aromatic, the lemongrass and tofu very well balanced and the salad indulgently peanut-y rich.  I want to come back for dinner to try Thai specialties like Catfish salad and Kra Praw.  Vegan? They have a vegan friendly section of the menu with myriad options. On a budget? Lunch specials to eat and still have left overs under 10 bucks. Looking for authentic? The food is so well spiced: tamarind, lemongrass and chili forward cooking, Thai regional specialties abound (read- crispy duck, red snapper, curry MMMM.)  I highly recommend this place for a singleton on lunch break and big groups alike. They can accommodate anyone",
