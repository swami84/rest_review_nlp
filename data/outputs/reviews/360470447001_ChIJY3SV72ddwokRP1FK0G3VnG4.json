        "caption": "I\u2019ll start off with saying that I\u2019m not one to leave reviews unless completely appalled, or completely impressed.  Upon hearing about La Cantine from a friend, I immediately picked up on the extremely well executed aesthetic that they present across the board, which may not be important to some - but a very big detail for me. The logo, the colors, the layout / use of the space, and the presentation of the food on their Instagram, it was all perfectly presented & so pleasing to look at, which is something that SO many restaurants & businesses overlook, even if the quality of food is there.  My first experience was through Uber Eats, and I ordered a few things from their daily specials list. Upon the food arrival, everything was very well packaged, and was still nice & hot. The food, was excellent. Although I did forget to tell them to leave out the Cornichon out of my sandwich, I almost happened to enjoy it, as it is obvious the sandwich I ordered was prepared with time, love, and care. It was delicious. The desserts I ordered, also knocked my socks off. Saved the rest of my food to eat the next day, and it was still so fresh.  I decided to visit La Cantine a second time, yesterday, with a friend. I ordered through their website, & the girl inside was very attentive & was so nice to begin to prep my order before I formally placed it on their site. The food was ready within less than 10 minutes, along with the drinks we ordered which were (10/10). The sandwich I ordered was excellent, it had texture, taste, and was just so delicious. The cookies I ordered, were magnificent - every bite was heaven.  It is very rare for me to leave a review, but I knew that with a place THIS consistent, and possibly overlooked, I had to spread the word and tell others about my damn near perfect experiences with this absolutely well executed restaurant.  I\u2019m already very much so looking forward to my next visit, as should you.",

Granted, the whole decor is charming, the staff friendly and the vibe pleasant. But $12, for a simple jambon-beurre sandwich? It is simply not worth it! It was fine, but you literally pay 4 Euros for the same in any decent bakery in France. Go there and taste it for yourself! Or if you can't, easier still, make one at home with a baguette from Foster-Sundry/Imprimerie nearby!  The quiche I had, quiche Lorraine\u2014super simple to make, and very satisfying when done well\u2014was average, and that's being nice. Again, we are not talking sophisticated-level cuisine, here. Just asking for a truly tasty quiche, which it was not. Ditto the salad, which looked colorful and tasty, but wasn't seasoned at all, and flavorless. Overall, disappointing for a total of over $40, with two bland hot chocolates. And that gets over 50 5-star reviews?! It's a wonder if anyone going here actually has tastebuds.",
