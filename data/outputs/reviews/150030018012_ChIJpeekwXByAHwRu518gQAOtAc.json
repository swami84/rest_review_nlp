There was one customer ahead of me, paying, and two walking in, with three or four staff members on (maybe more). The staff rushed through and were borderline rude in an attempt to clear their three person line. My sandwich was thrown together in a sloppy mess that fell apart as soon as I opened the paper. The bread was old and crumbly, as if it had been sitting there for days. I couldn't even finish the sandwich as there was mustard pouring out all sides of it, making it impossible to pick up. Really disappointing experience.",
