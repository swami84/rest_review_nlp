I only recently learned about Charcoal Guido's, after meeting and getting to know the management of this establishment.  My first experience with the food here was at a catered event, and I immediately took a liking the the meatballs.  After trying a nice variety of their dishes, I feel confident saying that this is some of the best Italian food I have ever had, and also some of the most unique.  The specials are inspired dishes that the staff have come up with, and they really hit it out of the park with the sweet and spicy calamari.  Another noteworthy dish is the Nutella pizza, which to me, is synonymous with Charcoal Guido's.  Do yourself a favor and don't pass this place by like I did for years.   On top of all the great food, the service is truly outstanding, and you can tell right away that the staff enjoy working here.  Thank you for all the amazing nights out I have had here!",

I was blown away when one of the owners stopped by and chatted with us to see if everything was perfect. It was more than perfect, it was exceptional!  Thank you for the hospitality and the amazing food. By the way the pizza with the arugula, figs, Gorgonzola cheese, caramelized onion. was amazing. I don't even like arugula, but damn it was good. I'm definitely going to order it again. Thank you.",

Salmon over white beans, arugula salad with cucumbers and tomatoes was a large portion and delicious.  Mahi mahi over a tasty risotto good also.  Great atmosphere on busy inviting street dotted with restaurants.  Nice ambience.  Only negative is the limited parking.  On street fills up and not much public parking nearby.

        "caption": "Not really sure what to say about this place to be honest. The Food isn't terrible, its actually pretty decent...but ridiculously overpriced for portion sizes.  We're talking Posto (the best italian that I've had in Boston) prices, for food that isn't even close to Posto's food quality.  Portions are STINGY      (you get a half teaspoon of olive oil to use as dipping sauce....for 4 people!)  Tables are crammed literally inches away from each other to pack in as many paying customers as possible...but so tightly packed that it feels like your sitting on top of the people next to you. The problem could easily be alleviated by removing 1 table, but if they're giving you a half a teaspoon of olive oil, instead of giving you a bottle to pour your own, that tells you everything you need to know about where the owner's priorities are. That said, the waitstaff is always very courteous and attentive, and extremely pleasant.  It's a shame, because with lower prices, more generous portions and 1 less table to give you some breathing room, this could be a decent little place to eat.  Edit: So i just went back to this place a few weeks ago, and with my dinner, I ordered a side of plain french fries.  When the bill came at the end of the meal, I realized that they charge me $8 .....FOR A SIDE OF FRENCH FRIES!!!!   I gave this place one more shot, and learned my lesson.  Unless you enjoy paying $8 for french fries, sitting on top of the people eating next to you, and having to pay for coffee refills, skip this place.  A ton of restaurants on Moody St. that will treat you much better as a patron.",

        "caption": "I've been here many times and I always love it. When you walk in it seems really noisy - and I guess it is - and it seems like a lot of people crammed together in one place - and I guess it is. But, as soon as you sit down, it no longer seems noisy, but lively, and it no longer seems crammed-in, but familiar. People just always seem to be in a good mood when they're there. You are sitting close (like in a restaurant you might find in France or Italy) and every single time, we end up having really nice conversations with the folks at the next table. Last night, we sang happy birthday to the little girl at the table to my right, and we talked about travel and dining with the Irish guy to my left. It seems like barriers are taken down and people are just there for a nice time with other people who want to have a nice time. It's a bit loud for sure, but not in the least boisterous - just the sound of happy people.  I lived in Italy for four years. I make my own pasta, my own sauces, my own risotto - and I'm pretty pleased that they are really authentic to what I grew to love in Italy. I don't order pasta in restaurants usually because, more often than not, I make better at home. This place, though. They have the best bolognese meat sauce I've had on this side of the Atlantic. They make their pasta in-house. The pizzas are fired in a brick oven and they are the real thing - like what one would get in Rome, not Waltham.  When you sit down you get fresh pizza bianca slivers and extra virgin olive oil for dipping. And they replenish it when you're done.  They do not skimp on portions. The salads are huge. Usually when a wait-person says the salads are big, what I get is something have the size of what I eat at home as part of my meal. But these are really big. We shared the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Delicious.  I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese and my husband had the fig and arugula pizza. The pizza has enough arugula on it to make another salad. You can certainly get a pizza with more traditional toppings, but you can also get some combinations you've maybe never tried before. But they are all really good. The pizza is thin crust and has the characteristic of being crunchy and chewy at the same time.  We had cannoli for desert - not that I had much room, but I had to try one. Totally authentic and delicious.  I like sitting on the side of the table that faces the wall because there are enormous photographs of Italy - and they bring me down memory lane from when I lived there.  Their wine list isn't extensive, but they have a short list of nice wines. Three or four of them are quite expensive - most of them are very moderately priced. We had a wonderful Montepulciano for $30. It was so good I want to see if I can hunt it down to have at home.  Prices are very reasonable for food and drink. Staff are incredibly friendly. Service is prompt. There's no sense of ever being rushed.  If you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner - Charcoal Guido's is not for you. If you are the type that doesn't like dining in close quarters - then this isn't for you. If you like REAL Italian food (not American Italian), and if you don't mind meeting some people while you sip your wine waiting for your meal, and if you like a place where everyone always seems to be in a good mood - then check this place out.  If this description sounds like a fun time to you, and you decide to check it out, Charcoal Guido's will become one of your favorite go-to's.",
