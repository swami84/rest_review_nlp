Then they said they could send another one and we said ok. After thinking about it with their nasty reply we thought it wouldn't be a good idea to receive that plate, so we contacted seamless told them we did not want the food and just wanted our money back for that order. At the end of it no refund was given and the plate was denied and sent back. Would never order from this place again nor would I recommend this place to anyone.
