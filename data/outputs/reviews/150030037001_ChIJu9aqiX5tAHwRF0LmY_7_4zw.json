I like the simple but not bad variety menu too. For $15, not bad at all. I also tried the 12oz clam chowder for $7. Both had great value and didn't mince on substance and you could see, taste the value. Clam chowder was a nice surprise with a hearty presentation of classic and potatoes in a nice sized bowl - with croutons. In all, both a pretty good overall value for the price.  If I had one recommendation,  it's to add a little fluff inside the lobster roll - I ordered buttered - which tasted great. I just think that a little slaw or something of their own touch, would put them over the top and give it more substance and perceived value, added taste. Just a humble suggestion. Bun was simple, straight forward, and nice compliment as well. Not hard at all. Great job Fat Cheeks! Will be back to try something else. And that's the point, right?! \ud83e\udd19\u270c",

First off I have only tried their shrimp sandwich. They also have crab and lobster.  The sandwich is now very small. If you've had their previous sandwiches like the Papa Pork it's tiny in comparison. I'd say 2/3rds the size...the whole thing fits into mini dish takeout container for reference.  The bread is still great and while the shrimp were nice and tender and not overcooked like many places it was very bland with little flavor to speak of. To make matters worse it's 12 bucks for this tiny bland sandwich.  Also got an order of clam chowder. It's 4 bucks for a 4oz. It was very good and came with home made croutons. Pricey for what it is but at least it was good so I'd say that was worth it.",

Still great for the area, but steep on the price. If you're just going to give me a generic .50\u00a2 bag of chips with a, what i think you try to classify as a gourmet lobster roll, my pallet is going to be crushed.    Will try and different roll, hold the chips tho please.  Also, they probably could save 5 dollars each roll if they didn't hand out self branded bags and all the gimicks, food first! Your hopes to be a catchy brand second.",
