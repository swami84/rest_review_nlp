Ready to fight back home after a few days in the city we decided to stop by reubens for a breackfast and found out that this deli has a extensive menu with soups, salads, charcuterie, cheeses, sandwiches, and a lot more.  My girl had a tuna salad, veggie soup, and latte. I had a chicken philly sandwich, and a cappuccino. Everything was very good.  My compatriot, the owner, treated us like home... He has owned the business for twenty five years, so I believe he knows something about...  Thanks a lot all of you there. We will see each other next time we are in town!!!",

There is nothing fancy about this place at all. In addition to a wide choice of sandwiches, they have soups and salads, good sides, coffee drinks and desserts.

You can get 2,3,or 4 egg omelets, the largest and fluffiest pancakes you have ever seen and a wonderful big breakfast combo meal featuring pancakes, eggs, bacon or turkey sausage all hot and fresh off the grill. You can also add any of their wonderfully carved/shaved lunch meats to your omelet as well. So if you're hungry by 8:00 in the morning and you want a real good breakfast that might even make you skip lunch, head on over to Reuben's and enjoy a treat!!! Natalie",

Usually you get pastrami or corned beef and it's overcooked or tough. You can see the slicer working as you line up to order. Everything is made to order. They also carry Zapp's chips. That's a nice Southern touch for a real NY-style deli. I'd put this deli up against any NYC deli.",

With regards to the food, both quality and taste were on point.  I lived and worked in New York City for a few years and this sandwich would rival some of the best establishments there.
