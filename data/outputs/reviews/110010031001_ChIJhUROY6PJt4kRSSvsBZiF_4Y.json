If I'm ever back in the city I hope to try the lentil patties--they were (not surprisingly) sold out.",

The cook (who was so sweet and helpful) had allowed us to have a sample of the stew and the meek sauce, but the meal really brought all the flavors together. My mate would have thrown in a few more sthat's if possible lol. Needless to say, we will definitely be coming back and telling friends!",

The food just wasn't flavorful and even the sorrel was watered down. I will try it again but probably opt for the smoothies and such rather than a meal. Oh, the lady was really nice that worked there but she could definitely use some support. As more folks walked in she's trying to balance the register, making the food, taking online/phone orders, and keeping tables clean.

I waited for my food close to 2 hours, and after waiting for one hour I was told that they ran out of rice and peas so I had to get plain brown rice. After finally receiving my food I noticed the portions were very small, rice was extremely dry. After waiting so long for the food, I expected it to taste good but it was just bland. I ordered a pina colada smoothie and I got something that had the consistency of juice. I will not be going back to this restaurant; this restaurant has been the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I wish I could give 0 stars.",
