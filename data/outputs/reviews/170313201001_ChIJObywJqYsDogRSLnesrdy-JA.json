Turkey was plain with just meat and cheese...they charged me $1 for a slice of cheese! Did not realize they didn\u2019t give me the chips until riding 3 banks of elevators and had to go back. Lady said \u201cYou were supposed to grab your chips under the register!\u201d Really?! You could have at least told me that when I paid! I\u2019ll NEVER eat at another Jimmy Johns again. Cold, plain sandwiches! Pot Belly has you guys beat!",
