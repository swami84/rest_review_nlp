Our party of 3 shared half a dozen plates, bottle of wine, and dessert, and weren\u2019t wowed by any of them.  All were incredibly salty and underwhelming. In fact, the only dish we did love was the fried beet spirals, which is embarrassingly easy to make. We tried the king crab, which is literally half or third of a leg no more than 3\u201d long, plated with some sauce for $20.  There\u2019s a reason why you can get a table here the night of on Friday or Saturday. Get a cocktail if you must but then walk over for dinner at Maude\u2019s, Elske, Avec, Lena Brava, etc. for a fulfilling dining experience.",

        "caption": "Absolutely fantastic. We drove in from Aurora and this place made it worth the drive. First off, we made a reservation through Open Table for 5 people. I'd recommend if you make a reservation for more than 4 that you call instead. We had to make the reservation for 10pm and the restaurant called to confirm and offered an earlier time which we took. Most of the tables are \"4 person tables\" but due to the bench seating can easily accommodate a 5th if the place isn't packed. The hostess can easily make that determination, but open table can't so it tells you all the large tables are booked, etc. So if open table gives you weird times, just call and double check.  The food was out of this world and the restaurant was casual and laid-back while still keeping an upscale feel. You could wear anything from jeans to cocktail attire and feel comfortable. The bartender was great, he made some custom drinks for a few people in our party. The service was excellent, our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. On top of all that, it was priced very reasonably for the quality food that we ordered. They have a tasting/pre fix option (if one person gets that, everyone at the table has too) and an a la carte option. They suggest getting one item from each section of the menu to get the full experience, but you could easily have a light meal and only pick one or two options. The oysters and salmon tartare were phenomenal. We will definitely be going back to g.e.b. soon!",

It was three of us so, we decided to order 3 different appetizers and share, this way we can try more plates. All three plates were delicious: the burrata, the octopus and the foie gras. I would say my least favorite was the octopus, but only because I've had, either similar or as good octopuses at  other restaurants.  For entrees we decided on an entree each: Scallops, Salmon and OH! the Porchetta <-- this was A-MA-ZING! They were all cooked to perfection.  My only regret was the 'polenta' my scallops came with, it was tasteless and the texture was not my favorite.  For dessert we shared one: the key lime pie. It was absolute  delicous-goodness!",

To top it off, Graham Elliot was at the restaurant that night and we got to chat with him and take a few pictures. If you do not know who Graham Elliot is, he is one of the three judges of the popular reality show MasterChef.  So my wife and I were in Chicago for the Labor day weekend and even before we took off, we had made a reservation for GEB.  We got our table promptly once we were at the restaurant and were treated with top notch service. We got complimentary popcorn which was really out of the world. They were spiced perfectly and we all just couldnt stop until the whole plate was clean.  For drinks, I got strawberry lemonade which was extremely tasty and fresh.  For our main course, I got Lamb trio which they made vegetarian with Chickpeas paste and it was amazing. Chickpea paste was so smooth that it melted in the mouth and tasted a bit like cheese. Even the veggies and the green beans that came with it were very flavorful. We also got the lobster risotto (without the lobster) and grilled eggplant and each dish was out of the world.  We had read good things about the desserts so we decided to order three different ones to try them out. We got the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Banana Split and deconstructed key lime pie. Trust me, we have never had such good desserts before. The desserts were not overly sweet but were just perfect.  Tip: Make sure you have the desserts here or your visit to GEB wont be worth.  Parking might not be that easy depending on when you go so look for street parking around the block or get a valet.",

We had intended to just sit at the bar for a drink and move on but as soon as we walked in we realized there were no seats at the bar so we were forced to sit at a table. Weird.",

The hostess was super friendly, bartender excellent and our server read us like a book.  We loved it.  The food was excellent as well.  We had the mixed green salad, risotto, and the white fish.  The salad was pretty standard.  I have to say, the risotto was decadent.  Creamy, cheesy, bacony, herb-y...it was excellent...and crazy only $11???  How is that even possible?!  The white fish was cooked to perfection.  There was a simple crust and the inside flaked off like butter.  The sauce was dill-like and just made a perfect bite with the fish and potatoes.  To end the meal, we had to get the banana split.  It was FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!  Salty, sweet, crunchy and aesthetically pleasing as well.  The scene was great.  It was a perfect bistro setting.  Loud, bustling, but not too much.  The kitchen was open as well.  I like that new concept that everyone and their brother is doing in the city.  Overall, I really enjoyed GEB.  The staff, food, setting were all great.  I would definitely go back.",
