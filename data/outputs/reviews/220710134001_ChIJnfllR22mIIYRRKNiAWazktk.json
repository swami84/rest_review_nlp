My favorite appetizers were the bacon and cheddar croquettes and the lobster mac and cheese. My entree was also excellent. I chose the Angus filet which was cooked and seasoned to perfection. As if that was not enough my side was a tasty dish of fried brussel sprouts with manchego cheese. While I'm not a fan of Brussels I must say these were great. All of this was followed by 3 different deserts shared by the table. We all had the chance to partake in a bit of bunny bread pudding topped with PB ice cream,  creme brulee and a delicious cheesecake. Even the coffee that accompanied our desert was great. The steakhouse is a must try! We had two great servers. Jasmine was an excellent server. Her great personality made the whole meal even more excellent. Anthony was also excellent and explained each dish to the table. Will return again!!!\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c",

If you don't really like drinking bc you don't like the taste of alchohol please try this. He will be on cmvacation so try him when he gets back in a week or so. I felt like I net with friends with the staff and I will recommend this location to everyone. I hate I can't remember my servers name :( I know she studied/lived in Atlanta.

When we were sat at our table we noticed almost immediately that the restaurant decor and look was very outdated, kind of resembling a Piccadilly, and had no bathroom. Service was pretty decent, our BBQ shrimp, salads, and drinks came out very quickly and tasted great. We ordered the swordfish and 10 oz filet, the Swordfish went great with the potatoes and mixed beans it came with, the filet was cooked perfectly, but was dry, grainy, and lacked any real flavor. The asparagus that came with the steak was undercooked and was not served with any hollandaise sauce. Overall our experience was pretty alright, but definitely not worth $185.",

One person in our party ordered a medium-rare, but it came out medium, almost medium-well.This is the same issue I had on another visit, steaks being over-cooked, not what was requested. I also agree with a previous reviewer questioning the quality of the meat. The steak we had was a little dry and tougher than ones we've had in the past.  We sat near the kitchen, where we could see the food expeditor. I noticed the expeditor touched every steak that came out of the kitchen with his bare fingers, between touching other surfaces with his hands. Did not see him wash his hands at any time. He also put his fingers in what looked like a baked potato. This is not very pleasant to watch, especially in front of the dining room. We go to Besh because we can use our comps from the casino.",

CONS: 1- table napkins now look like we're getting ready for an outdoor picnic 2- the fine dining menus are now just a one piece sheet of plastic 3- my once top if the line filet is a chewy hunk of meat 4- ordered the once off the chart pork chop plate to find a chewy over cooked cut of meat with no greens as the menus still says it comes with. When I advised the Mgr that they forgot my greens I was told they made the decision to drop the spinach- REALLY?? Same awesome employees that seem embarrassed by the changes- yes I was told Besh still owns the place but not sure I believe it or he has stopped looking!! Very sad",

Since it seemed as though all we did in New Orleans was eat, I wasn't too hungry which makes it difficult to know if the food isn't all that good or you just didn't care.  Our server was very nice and helpful and when I asked for a Chardonnay he brought me a very nice glass, not too oakey.  While we were looking at the menu he brought out a plate of buttery toasted crostini along with liver pate compliments of the chef.  Nice touch and it was really tasty.  I opted to have just a salad with butter lettuce, toasted nuts and dressing, way too big a portion and the dressing was over powering.  Instead of an entree I had Big Bad BBQed Oysters supposedly topped with crab.  Absolutely no flavor at all.  Not a success.  My husband had a steak which is said was ok but a bit over cooked.  If you're in the casino and want dinner, it's not bad and not expensive but I wouldn't go out of my way for the restaurant.",
