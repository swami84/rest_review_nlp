We were embarrassed after talking the place up so much. At least I wasn't charged for the steak that was so tough it was inedible. We are really disappointed because we have been coming here since it first opened and we live just steps away.  The food and service is always perfect.

So BEWARE Reservations are a Must.  About a month later I decided to try again, this time with reservations in place. I even walked in a bit late but thank goodness for the app(RESY) I reserved with because all it took was a text to let the host know.  Let me tell you, the ambiance is romantic and cozy with candle light almost everywhere and dimmed light to really get the night started. And I havent even mentioned their list of alcoholic beverages!! I started with an Antipasti which was Octopus cooked to perfection aka not chewy in the slightest. Then for my Primi I had the Spaghetti which had the best ratio of spice and flavor..... so so good.... Lastly I ended with their Chocolate Boudino which was like a mouse but slightly thicker and super rich in all the best ways.  Only Con I can come up with is the price....but then again I know im not only paying for this well prepared food but also the comfort that comes with eating at such a well put together establishment.  Thanks again to the Staff and Amazing job to the cooks... Ill be Back.",

Our first visit was on a regular Thursday night where they told us they ran out of focaccia. Not a big deal, right? Unless you\u2019re a focaccia fan and checked out the restaurant based on focaccia being on the menu. Other than this, the food and service were great!  We decided to give it another go and spend our NYE at the restaurant. Had late seating, 10pm. We arrived around 1007pm and our table wasn\u2019t yet ready. We were sat 10 minutes to 11pm. The hostess was extremely nice and updated our pricing for the meal, comped our wine, and provided a free glass of champagne. That was all very nice and greatly appreciated.  But...we were disappointed by timing between courses, availability of menu options (some items were no longer available), food temperature, flourless cake was more like cake batter, and of course, there wasn\u2019t ample focaccia to order. So that\u2019s two strikes on focaccia. :-)  We\u2019ll give it a third try soon...",

My wife and I since moving to Prospect Heights have put Faun on our shortlist of favorite dinners and brunches and more tellingly our shorter list of restaurants to show off to friends and family visiting from afar.  Why review now? It's Sunday--what else should I be doing?  Today, we stopped in for brunch. Pictured are the Eggs Florentine and the Skirt Steak. Not shown was the Bibb Lettuce and a Latte. Also not pictured is the beautiful, farmhouse inspired interior complete with ship-lap paneling in the back and wooden boxes filled with potted plants that line the walls and windows, and for the warmer seasons a backyard that boasts party-sized tables.  It's worth noting here, that we've never had bad service. Despite the assuming, austere menus the wait staff and management never scoff at a request for a definition or look askance when asked \"which do you like more?\"  To the food! Speaking to today's meal: The Bibb is massive, refreshing, and deliciously light with a seasonal rotation of fresh toppings. The latte is generous with uniform bubbles and mellow espresso. The Eggs Florentine: perfectly soft with bitter fresh arugula and spinach, generous hollaindaise, and a plump crispy biscuit. My skirt steak was served more rare than I'd liked, but with a peppery fresh-out-of-the-pan sear and too oily chimichuri. The potato wedges, while satisfyingly crunchy had a mushy, dry interior.  From the service, to the atmosphere, to the delicious food, Faun gives you a memorable meal that will have you circling back for the ever-rotating menu.",

        "caption": "1) Service was overall good, although it isn't the best of ideas to lean in to cleanup the table so much so that patrons should twist themselves out of the way to allow the overzealous brushing of crumbs on the table cloth. I would suggest recommending the staff to ask customers for their cooperation to allow the cleanup of a table while others are still finishing their dish. If a customer happens to be in the way, once asked they might be amenable to stand or move aside to help expedite the operation. Better yet perhaps, just have staff ask patrons if they'd like to have the table crumbs cleaned away... it might be surprising but some of us might not mind at all especially if there is no need for it and could wait until after the seated party will have left.  2) The napkins are fabric ones and that might be ok as long as they are washed properly. And that also includes to have napkins that won't shed lint all over your face and clothes when used. Our pants and shirts looked like they've had been sprayed with lint. Also it was most unpleasant to use them to dampen one's lips on them. Thankfully I do not have asthma but was enough to bother my breathing too. If that was the consequence of using a cleaning service the owners may want to think about asking the service they use to just dry the naplinsk not bake them until they come undone in the customer's hands. It's very unlikely that the staff setting up the table didn't notice the issue therefore the choice to not address the problem was a conscious one. The best option would have been to use back up napkins and if none were available use paper napkin letting patrons know about the issue and apologizing for it. Returning customers who know would understand that it wasn't because the place is going the cheap route (and it's not like using paper napkins is the same as having to use paper plates to begin with). New customers will appreciate the lengths at which the place went to make the customer as comfortable as possible despite the establishment experiencing some slight issues with the company which is providing them linens cleaning service.  3) The food is between acceptable and pretty good. For those raving about this place I am truly glad for each and every one of them, but I'd suggest to try a few more good restaurants around the world with emphasis to visit both Italy and France (as faun seems to draw mostly from these two specific cuisines) so that they could refine their palate a bit more so that they'd be able to put in a more fair and fitting prospective any restaurant when reviewing it. I am not a Michelin, Zagat or similar food critic despite I have my own mileage. I'm also not a \"foodie\" getting overly enthusiastic upon discovering contrasting or complementary flavors/textures. It's also not my habit to spend time reviewing an establishment unless I feel it's deserving of the effort. Two-liners and short praises (or complaint) are of little to no importance in my personal opinion. I' care little about someone with unclear culinary and palate refinement experience (and to others I'd fit in the same category) reviewing a given dishes with expressions such as \"delicious\", \"marvelous\", \"to die for\". Without proper context telling why they felt compelled to identify them as such, those are useless. With no description about how scent, smell, flavors, texture, temperature, savory, saltiness, sweetness, etc on played a role in the complex experience which starts the moment a dish is set in front of them (including the presentation of it) such expressions are meaningless. I  do give props whenever they are due and Faun does not deserve a terrible rating (unless your experience went horribly wrong for whatever reason). What is stripping stars off in this unfortunate case are the  issues that would perhaps be considered minor otherwise, if they were not getting in the way of achieving a memorable experience (and dining isn't solely about food). Unfortunately Google decided that's all I'm allowed to write so I'll have to leave it at that.",

It tasted fine, but it's not a popular condiment in the US due to the bitter nature which was exacerbated by the fact that the peels in it were very big. Nice spaghetti carbonara. The duck in the duck hash was very salty. This can be a side effect of duck confit, but I've had it many times where it was not overly salted, so I think there was some heavy handedness. While the scrambled egg and potatoes were good, the steak was flavorful, but incredibly tough on the steak and eggs. I mentioned it to the waiter and he didn't do anything about it. I asked for another steak knife, which he brought, but to me it was the opportunity to do something about. It was like a chew toy. We liked the sausages as well.",

        "caption": "I ate here last weekend. They had only been open for 1 day, so I was bracing for some chaos.  First of all, the restaurant is adorable-- totally fits the neighborhood vibe and is my kinda place to go to for drinks and some serious eats. (five stars on atmo) The garden was closed due to rain, but looks lovely.  What really stole the show was the food. We ended up ordering the entire menu (no joke) mostly because it all looked good and interesting. The chef comes from some serious pedigree-- former ex. chef of Vinegar Hill House! Hello!!  The stars of the night were the pastas for sure and all the apps I could eat everyday. Entrees were delicious, but I was a bit full by the time they came. ( 5 stars on food)  Service was shockingly good for a new joint and the food came out on time. I like that they take rezzies--so rare in brooklyn-  and not tips. Overall I think this is a great additional to the street!",
