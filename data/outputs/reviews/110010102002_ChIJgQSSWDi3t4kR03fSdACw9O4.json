The food is flavorful but very light on the protein portions. Additionally, the meats were tough (maybe over cooked, under cooked or cheap meat cuts). I've had better success with the NW locations, as opposed to this one in SW. The service was speedy & we were treated well. I just wish that the food met the level of service we received.",

The queso is amazing, but unfortunately the portion control is very hit and miss here. $9 for a half cup of queso just isn't worth it and about half the time I order it that's all I get in the cup. Attempts to communicate with management about any issues go ignored.",
