Having serious reservations on eating Thai (i\u2019m thai) believing it would cater to tourists and not be authentic, I took a chance anyways. I\u2019m glad I did. Considering we are in a pandemic, the restaurant was pretty busy but socially distanced. We decided to do take-out and waited outside for our order. The lady who took our order was also the one waitress. She was super busy but efficient. I ordered panang with tofu $14, medium spice. It was a large portion, delicious and spicy but not too spicy. My kid had the ginger chicken $14. She ordered without mushrooms. This was prepared much different than what she is used to (chicken and long beans) but having tried theirs, stated it was the only way she\u2019d eat bell peppers. That speaks volumes as she doesn\u2019t like them. Flavors were very good and not overpowering. We also ordered sticky rice $2.50. Their portions are big for takeout and I had leftovers for 3 days. Sticky rice was also generous. I definitely would come here again. It\u2019s true not to judge a book by it\u2019s cover. It\u2019s located upstairs and I would never have seen it just passing by. Not sure where I\u2019d park if I drove (walked from our hotel) so would assume street parking. Give them a chance. A little pricey but definitely delicious.",

I wonder how many people are caught out like this since it is very close to a touristy area. Then when we asked for an itemized bill for T&L business expense, a rough copy with short forms like PT and SR ( spring rolls) was given-the docket he took the order on.

Whilst we waited for over 40 minutes, other customers left due to the staff's negligence and inability to take an order. Once we finally got the servers attention, after serveral prompts,the waitress was very rude and had a negative attitude.  In addition they brought out the mains before out entree,we asked when the entree will be ready and found out they hadn't even started. We were hoping the food would atleast make up for the atrocious service but it was arguably as bad, the underlying sauce tasted like it bought from a supermarket.

Since this was a result of one of their customers, you would think they would react and try to help. They literally did nothing including cleaning up the mess on the floor that other customers began to step in and track through the restaurant. Their customer service skills were so bad that I literally had to go behind the counter and grab a bar rag and run to the bathroom to clean up. Thank God a customer saw what happened and ran to help me. If it weren\u2019t for this Good Samaritan I wouldn\u2019t know what I would have done. Now fast forward 10-15 minutes....believe it or not they still haven\u2019t cleaned up the mess on the floor. Not only did the staff not care but I now wonder how clean their establishment really was. Unfortunately, I was in a state of shock and ended up eating dinner only because it was late and being new in town I didn\u2019t know where else to go. Their food was your average Thai food but yet again the service was poor. I am not saying that because if the incident. Ask the 2 tables next to me as we were all single tables that were waiting for what seemed like forever. Do yourself a favor, don\u2019t eat here! There are so many amazing Thai restaurants that are clean, have amazing food and exceptional service. Why come here and be treated like dirt? Again, I have never seen such an unresponsive, uncaring group of individuals. NO customer service skills - period!",

Negatives Below. 1) The Restaurant isn't the most clean it isn't extremely untidy but some windows could be cleaned and the floor could have been cleaned better.  Would I reccomened the restaurant?  Yes I would highly reccomened this restaurant if you want authentic Thai food for a great cheap price and a prime location.  Would I reccomened it",

Ordered Tom Yum Goong medium spicy and Pad Kee Mao medium as well (No mild option for this one). Flavor was good but nothing spectacular. I felt my Tom yum had a lot of lemon grass but needed a bit more galanga and coriander.  The soup had about 3 or 4 shrimp. The drunken noodles needed fish sauce, as the flavor was a bit weak. Be aware, food is SPICY. I eat really Spicy food  so I enjoyed it, but other people might find it too hot. It appears this is a common issue here as there was something in the menu saying they don't refund money for dishes that are too spicy.",

We said we had ordered it we kept asking for it and still no one brought it. Most of the food we had ordered had been eaten at this point. The server said it had not been ordered did we still want it. We decided no. At this point they could have apologised and admitted they made a mistake. They could have gone to get it and provided it to us at no charge. Nope they didn't and continued to ignore us. The table was full of dirty dishes they didn't pick up. Not did they ask us if we wanted anything more to drink or if we wanted any dessert. It was terrible service and because they made a huge mistake they ignored it rather then trying to fix it.",

There were 5 of us in my family eating, my two teenage sons, 22 year old daughter and my husband and myself. Ordering was easy and the food took about 15-18 minutes to come to the table which I felt was reasonable. There were 4 or 5 females attending all of the tables sharing in the many responsibilities. No one waitress waited on us, as they all came to the table at different times. After we had placed our order, I began smelling a foul odor that seemed like a filthy dog odor mixed with foot odor of someone wearing the same shoes and socks for weeks, I can\u2019t describe it any better and I\u2019m sorry. It was foul and it stayed for a good 10 minutes and my husband and son commented that something was terribly sour or dirty... I told one waitress and she just nodded her head and never came back to address it. We sensed it slightly less through the meal, not knowing if it were olfactory fatigue or if it was truly dissipating. We received our check which had a red stamp with words \u201c15% gratuity is recommended\u201d.  The bill had the items\u2019 amounts listed and one 4% under the top half sum and then 15% listed on the lower half, neither percentage explained, with it all added to the final sum. When we went to the counter register to pay, I asked if the gratuity for the 5 of us were automatically added and the waitress said yes. I asked if this is what is done for each customer and she said yes, for everyone. The credit card receipt she asked me to sign had a line for additional gratuity to be added. I take issue with adding the gratuity and then putting the statement in red on the bill seemingly suggesting the customer pay another 15% of the total without stating anywhere that the gratuity is added in on each check as a standard policy. I asked about the smell and she said no one else had complained and asked did I still smell it. She said the waitress had told her that I had said something but she had no one else complain. I enjoyed the food but the experience was completely soured by the gratuity farce and then the lack of response to the strong odor. We did enjoy the food ...",

Noodles, simple, not spicy is gentle to the stomach, the soup stock was effective and it was delicious.  Stir-fry is more painful than I expected, so please be careful when choosing spicy.  Fried rice seemed delicious, too, but I wanted to ask, but my stomach was full and gave up.  I was full when I went, but the rotation seems to be fast.

The pad woon sen was missing 2 of the vegetables listed on the menu description and they use fatty thigh meat, not chicken breast, as the waiter tried to tell me it was. We also ordered Thai fried rice and were served the pineapple fried rice. Sent it back and it looked like they re-served the original without the pineapple. Lastly, we ordered the spicy eggplant with vegetables. They ONLY thing it contained was eggplant. It tasted like a Chinese dish and was very oily.

The amount is voluminous, so if you want to eat a lot of different types, it is recommended to go with a large number of people. You can choose the spiciness from 3 patterns. I ordered it mildly, but it's not spicy at all, so I thought that Thai food lovers should order from medium. I don't even know if it contains coriander. Not only Thai food lovers but also those who are not good at eating can eat with almost no problem! There is also a Japanese menu, so I don't think it's a problem if you can't speak English.

Here, if you are happy to eat and ask for a bill when calculating, you will be given a bill with a tip. It's written on the bill like this. -> 15% service charge include. And if you give me a card, the tip will be included to make payment, right? If it ends here, it's okay. There is no need to calculate the troublesome tip. But the problem is that the tip column gives another bill. The problem is from here. I have already included the tip, so I paid for it. So I called an employee and asked. Apparently, I know that it was paid with a tip, but why is the tip column giving a blank statement? That said, you can just say that the tip has already been calculated. As I watched the reaction quietly, it seems that I'm not asking once or twice. For those who don't know, especially newly married couples who don't know how much the price is, they just open their eyes and snore. If you are Korean, I hope you will know this.

It may look like a tourist trap, seeing as its above an ABC store, but trust me, it is legit, Mr and Mrs Tourist.  Because I've never tried it, the green curry was ordered, along with brown rice.  Once it arrived, and my curry professional plated it for me, I dug in with my chop sticks.  I dont know if it was the heat wave, or the high methane content of my shared hostel room, but time felt like it paused for a moment, as the nuttiness of the rice danced with the delicious aroma and coconut'y spice, all the way down my esophageal into my duodenum.
