We order the mantu, bologna, and the meat samosas. The mantu barely had any meat in it all I tasted was onions. The bologna seemed like it was fry in cold oil cause it was soaked in oil. The somosas was burned and also absolutely no meat in it. They took a half a bologna and sliced up in little pieces. My husband ordered the mix combo the lamb wasnt cooked the shrimp tasted like it was boil.  Overall the food was horrible. I wouldn't recommend this place. I'm an Afghan and I know this place wasnt owned by an afghan, cause Afghan wouldn't serve food like that. On top of all that they serve alcohol. If I would have know I wouldn't have gone there and spend my money.",

I can get a lamb over rice that tastes way better for $6. Everything tasted like it was cooked and then just reheated. The salad tasted and looked like it was made the day before. Kofta was certainly cooked and reheated on grill. Rice most likely microwaved. Also silverware and glasses were dirty. Nope not again.",

We ended up cancelling the pulao dish because it had been 1 hour since we ordered and we had to head out. The beef kabob dish was pretty good. Glad to know that all the meat served here is Halal (although ironic that they unfortunately also serve alcohol here as well). All in all, it was pretty good food but under average service.

The food: we ordered Afghan bread, mantoo, and split the lamb kabobs! The Afghan bread was delicious, the sauce served with it was very bold so just lightly dip! The mantoo is a beef filled dumpling with a tomato and yogurt sauce, so yummy! The lamb kabobs was definitely our favorite! The meat was well seasoned and grilled to perfection! Ohhh! For dessert we split the firnee; a cool custard topped with pistachios... great ending to a lovely meal!  The service: our server was so polite and attentive! We were a bit nervous as other reviewers stated the service was sub par. We are happy we took the chance! Everything was wonderful!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",

The server (and maybe owner?) came to us and convinced us that the food would be ready in 5 mins and we would not be late. Sure enough he delivered! Even better, the food was fantastic!! The mantoo was super fresh and the dumpling dough was soft and delicate. Everyone else got some type of kebab (beef, chicken, and lamb) and we were all very satisfied. The meat was fresh, tender, and very well prepared. Food was excellent, service was excellent, and we came away very, very happy.",

Downsides: The food came out quickly, but otherwise the service was very slow (5+ minutes before we were greeted at the table or given water, and we repeatedly had to flag down the waiter for more water throughout the meal). This is why I took off a star. The only other negative was that the rosewater in the custard was too heavy (although, admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of rosewater).",

The food is the lowest quality you can find. The prices are ridiculously high. Now the food: we ordered the grill combo and chicken texture was like rubber, asked the chef and responded yes it's \"afghan chicken\". We could only eat the rice and salad from the grill plate. The lamb was fairly good but beef was salty as dried fish or jerky. After all this, the waitress had the guts to bring the check and adding tip without my consent. There are many Afghani options within 2 mile radius, better off somewhere else.",

The aushak tasted fine, the leeks were a bit undercooked, and the sauce was uneven and not and meaty or smooth as it should be. Additionally for 17 dollars I only received 7 dumplings which were not very big and probably old because two of them were stuck together like they had cooled. To top it off, they tried to make me pay with cash by claiming that the credit card machine wasn't working because of the internet? even though there are the various credit card logos posted on the door.

While at this one, a man who appeared to be the owner stepped out and really tried to get us into his place. Talked about how his lamb was best around. Then about how his food wasn't spicy like Indian kabobs. We said that we were only a little hungry but we're looking at menus for later, he said that \"everyone says that,\" then offered a free appetizer if we came in. We thanked him, but told him maybe later. We looked at a few others then decided to give Afghan food a try as it was new to us.  We decided to try the combination platter appetizer and the combination kabob. We told him not to worry about the free appetizer, but he said he would keep his word, and would bring us one of the smaller ones. Shortly after, he brought us a plate of bread and said \"everyone gets this.\" We also saw him giving the bread to other customers shortly after they arrived.  The food was good, we all enjoyed the appetizers, especially the one that looked like ravioli (tasted way better). Kabob meat had a slightly charred outside and tender center. Service was also attentive and friendly.  Prices were a bit higher than I would think of as fair for what we got. Then the bill came and we noticed a 1.99 charge for \"braed\" (we assume bread?) Which caught us of guard because it was given to us. We just paid it because it was a tiny portion of the total bill, but it definitely seemed unfair. If this had not occurred, I would have rated a 4. If you do not want that $1.99 charge, make sure to tell them, \"No bread!\"",

We were getting food to go, but they brought us water and salad and bread while we waited. The salad was good, and the rest of he food we had was good but not excellent. I liked the pumpkin entree, but the lamb kebab was overcooked.",
