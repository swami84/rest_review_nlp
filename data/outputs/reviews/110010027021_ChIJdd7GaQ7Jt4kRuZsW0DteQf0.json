In one of DC's many taco deserts, this might have been a 3 star, good-enough-I-guess review. But it takes serious hubris to move into one of the best taco areas of DC, into the space previously inhabited by the incredible Lezo's tacos no less, and serve up standard mediocrity at premium prices.  The tacos are... decent, I guess. Uninspired. Anything that would require the chefs to show off real skill, like al pastor, isn't even on the menu. Not an ounce of individuality or creativity, standard recipes executed competently but with no verve. Nothing taste-wise that would wow you the way Lezo's or a half dozen other places in the DC area would. You're left to choose a salsa and toppings for your tacos like this is Chipotle, confirming that the chef in no way has a particular vision for the taste that they want you to have.  The fringe stuff isn't great, either. The agua frescas are uneven and unbalanced. I liked mine, my wife's was badly done. The space wasn't maintained that well even though there wasn't any big rush of customers. They waited until after we eat to ring us up, forgot what we'd ordered, and so overcharged us a little bit. Not the end of the world, nothing I'd care too much about if the food was solid. But when you're serving blah tacos at a premium price... Nah.",
