After I received my tea and tasted it it was extremely watery and had zerooo flavor. I was told that it had green tea in it as the base after complaining (when the menu clearly says milk tea) . Once I told the cashier I didn\u2019t want the purple water. I was told there was nothing that can be done. After speaking to everyone in this booth and repeating the beverage was grosss. We were then  able to exchange and get passion fruit tea with bubble and it was extremely sweet. In conclusion , if you want the worst bubble tea go to Mr.Lin.",
