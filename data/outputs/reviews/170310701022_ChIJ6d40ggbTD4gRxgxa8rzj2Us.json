We ordered the Turkish breakfast (for 2) and pistachio baklava. The entire order and meal readiness took about 20 minutes. We initially thought we would get to go boxes to dine in(which is what most businesses do in COVID these days- which is so not fun when dining in) but we were pleasantly surprised to see a platter with cheese, dips, salami and salad and another platter with borek (bread) , Sucuklu Yumurta (a la shakshuka) and sujuk eggs with meatball side. Now I don\u2019t know where to begin. The cheese with the variety of dips (7 to be precise) was heaven on earth. The authentic chocolate, strawberry marmalade, honey, sesame dips and more were just divine. We kept sighing with every bite! The show stopper is borek! The warmest, gooiest, tastiest bread we ever ate - rolled in cheese and spices! The sucuklu yumurta was a flavorful combo of eggs and veggies and blended well with the borek. Meatballs - no words - half poached eggs and delicious oil was worth every penny! The turkish tea- oh! I don\u2019t know where to start!!! The turkish tea blew us away and baklawa - we were transported to Turkey - like now! All in all- highly recommend, worth the price, the location and the lazy brunch weekend! My spouse is so NOT a brunch person and he promises this will be his go to spot. Thank YOU turkitch team!",

Unfortunately I didnt have the chance to dine-in due to COVID restrictions, but that didnt stop me to try its Burek, Panini, Pide and the Ketayef. Without any reservations, I can say that all of the items above tasted terrific. From the first bite, I could taste the passion and love poured into making the meals. I feel the owners and the Chef (special mention) really love to cook and serve Turkish meals with pride. I loved that, so much so, that I came back the next day for more. I highly recommend this place and would urge you to try the Ayvalik Panini, Ketayef and the Menemen. They are superb dishes. Words of advice to the owners who are planning on an aggressive expansion, please maintain the professional execution in making all the dishes anywhere you go, if you keep doing what you are doing at this location, I am certain more people will fall in love with Turkish food!",

The food was fresh and the meat had a sweet taste to it, which was refreshing. I wish more rice was given, and possibly garlic sauce along with the meal.  I got the chicken rice meal, and it was a little pricy ($18 total whereas most places would sell this for around $12), but I think it\u2019s worth trying. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

They\u2019re definitely big on Turkish sausage, but have chicken, breakfast, and a few other options as well. Didn\u2019t get a chance to try out any of the desserts today, but they looked delicious.  5 stars, will be back soon!",

This was our first time going to Turkitch and I was so excited that I invited our family friends to come with us to enjoy our Sunday brunch together. Well, first of all, this is not a place for families- maybe for friends. Yes, they do have a high chair for babies, but they, so rudely, answer your question when you ask for one. The tables are so small- not even enough to accommodate a family of 3, let alone a group. We ordered Turkish menemen and soudjuk omelet. Well, they did not even bring bread with either until I went to the counter and asked for it (should have been natural).. Since we were a group we also got soudjuk and cheese simit, a few baked goods and burek, none of which were fresh (simit was better relative to the others- but way below expectations). When I went to get a PAID refill for the tea thermos we had, the male employee treated me in the most disrespectful manner until I told him that I had my wallet with me to pay! (It is not like I was going to runaway with the tea thermos!!) The only employee that I was happy with was the girl who refilled my thermos- she was very kind and deserves all kinds of promotions. When I complained to her about how rudely I was treated (not expecting anything to change; just told her that I regretted coming there for a Sunday brunch), she told the other employee who brought us a plate of cookies and apologized, hence the 2 stars.  I must also mention that it was not busy at all; I could have understood the behavior (although still can\u2019t be justified) had the restaurant been full. Never going back.",
