I stick with the usual and get General Tso's Chicken, which is amazing! They know how to get the perfect crunchyness of the fried chicken and sweet yet tangyness of the sauce. I recently got their chow mein, which was to die for!  The prices are really great too, $9-10 for a quart, $5-6 for a pint, or the same ($5-6) for a lunch special which includes rice and choice of drink or soup. Overall I highly reccomend this Chinese food place, I've tried others in the area, but nothing compares to the quality (no MSG, all white-meat) and low prices.",
