Once you\u2019ve been there once you just want to support them because they are that nice.  Now the sushi... is top quality. Can\u2019t beat the prices and the more expensive sushi restaurants we go to have similar if not a little worse of quality. Overall if you haven\u2019t been and are thinking about going, do it.
